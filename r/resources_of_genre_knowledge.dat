40|$|This study investigates how <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> and {{metacognition}} can be scaffolded in a genre-based {{course for}} doctoral students engaged in writing research articles. We argue that current definitions <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> development encompass {{the development of}} metacognition, and thus adopt an inter-disciplinary approach to illustrate how metacognition—specifically metacognitive knowledge—can be scaffolded in the genre classroom. We developed two tasks for this purpose. In the first, {{students were asked to}} describe their writing context and genres. For the second task, {{at the end of the}} course, students submitted a visual conceptualization <b>of</b> the research <b>genres</b> in their specific scientific community. This visualization was accompanied by an account of students’ observations about genre, and a reflection on how these insights could be applied to their ongoing writing situation. Students were also interviewed two to six months after the course to explore how they reported using <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> in their writing. Results showed that the metacognitive tasks elicited an integrated view <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> and encouraged students’ conceptualization of this knowledge as a tool for writing. In interviews, students reported using facets <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> metacognitively in their writing, by describing how they engage with reader expectations, conventions, variation, and the possibility of strategic deliberate choices...|$|R

40|$|Summary This article {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how the concept <b>of</b> <b>genre,</b> defined as a linguistically realized activity type, {{can be applied to the}} study of organizational discourse. In particular, the authors show how and for what practical purposes managers invoke genres in meetings. The data of the study consist of video-recorded company-internal meetings and the methodology is based on ethnomethodological conversation analysis. In the empirical analysis the authors show how genres are used as resources for joint understanding and for conducting a particular conversational action in a meeting, namely proposing a solution to a problem. The study highlights the importance <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> in managerial meetings and the practical nature of this <b>knowledge.</b> Conversation Discourse <b>Genre</b> <b>Genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> Managerial work Meeting interaction...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of writing with peer response using <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> 6 th grade students. Meta-studies (Hillocks 1984; Graham & Perin, 2007) indicated that peer response is effective for writing. However, these studies did not focus on what makes peer response working. In addition, several studies discuss the quality of peer comments during writing conferences (too general comments, pre-occupation with spelling and interpunction, no concrete suggestions for revision of contents). A literature review was undertaken indicating that instruction in <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{may be used to}} improve the quality of peer comments by providing a concrete focus. However, studies into peer response with instruction in <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> with strong experimental designs have not been conducted yet. In addition it is not clear what type <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> supports students' writing, discussing and revising. In an experiment (141 students, randomly assigned to three conditions), the effects of two approaches of peer response with <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> have been investigated. In one condition students were taught Specific <b>Genre</b> <b>Knowledge</b> (functions <b>of</b> linguistic indicators of time and place in narratives and instructions). In another condition students were taught General Aspects of Communicative Writing (general purpose of narratives and instructions, and goal- and audience-oriented writing). Both groups were compared with a base-line control group (no peer response and no <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge)</b> receiving writing lessons from the normal teacher. Results showed strong effects of the condition SGK, outperforming the two other conditions on text quality of four post-test writing tasks. No differences were found between the condition GACW and the baseline control group.

These changes are discernable in the nonverbal features of color, size, design, and typography as well as the verbal features including text length, formality, reference terms, and mood.

40|$|To better {{understand}} the promising effects of data-driven learning (DDL) on language learning processes and outcomes, this study explored DDL learning events enabled by the Research Writing Tutor (RWT), a web-based platform that contains: an English language corpus annotated to enhance rhetorical input; a concordancer searchable for rhetorical functions; and an automated writing evaluation engine that generates rhetorical feedback. Guided by current approaches to teaching academic writing (Lea 2 ̆ 6 Street, 1998; Lillis, 2001; Swales, 2004) and by Bereiter and Scardamalia’s (1987) knowledge-telling/knowledge-transformation model, {{we set out to}} examine whether and how direct corpus uses afforded by RWT impact novice native and non-native writers’ genre learning and writing improvement.

40|$|The study {{presented}} in this dissertation focusses on the analysis of novices' trajectories in learning <b>genres</b> <b>of</b> their profession, engineering. The goals of the study are: (a) to refine the current understanding of what constitutes professional <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> and <b>of</b> how novices learn and use <b>genres</b> <b>of</b> professional communication, and (b) to test {{the effectiveness of the}} suggested pedagogy for an Engineering Communication course. This qualitative longitudinal exploration includes ten case studies that span eight years and trace the participants' trajectories through the university and workplaces. I use a combination of three theoretical perspectives [...] -Rhetorical Genre Studies, Activity Theory, and situated learning [...] -as a lens for the analysis of novices' learning trajectories on their way to becoming professional communicators. The study demonstrates that in addition to the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> conventions and understanding of an audience's expectations, <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> is a result of a summative effect of such ingredients accumulated from different sources at different time periods as (a) cultural capital, (b) domain content expertise, (c) the novice's understanding of the improvisational qualities <b>of</b> <b>genre,</b> (d) agency, as reflected in the novice's ability to both seize and create kairotic moments in the chronological flux of time and enact genres in the ways that are recognizable by the community of practice, (e) formal education, (f) workplace experiences, and (g) private intention. The study indicates that the ingredients <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> accumulated in one context may be used in another, that is, that rhetorical strategy may be portable, thus allowing novices to adapt genres learned elsewhere to a new rhetorical situation. The study also shows that communication practices can be successfully taught outside of local contexts, for example, in the academic classroom. In addition I draw pedagogical implications of the inquiry for the communication classroom; for example, that communication instructors need to extend their pedagogies beyond teaching genre conventions and audience awareness and provide classroom contexts that would allow students to develop the understanding <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> as allowing for flexibility and educated intervention. The study also shows that the timing of the offering of domain-specific communication courses is crucial for the students to be able to develop the sense of connections among communication courses, subject matter courses, and professional practice...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{significant}} number of scholars and other professionals who use English as a second language, {{little is known about}} how multilingual writers develop skills in the <b>genres</b> <b>of</b> disciplinary communication; even less is understood about the potential role of writing instruction in this development. In a longitudinal multiple-case study, this dissertation investigates four international graduate students 2 ̆ 7 development of “genre knowledge”—knowledge not only of textual form, but also of subject-matter content, the rhetorical scene, and the procedural practices that accompany the genre. The study describes the writers 2 ̆ 7 <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> several <b>genres</b> at different points in time and traces the various influences on knowledge development. Collected data include ESL writing classroom observations, classroom documents, written feedback, oral interviews, and the writers 2 ̆ 7 texts produced over an 18 -month period both in the writing classroom and in the writers 2 ̆ 7 disciplinary endeavors. The study centers on the writers 2 ̆ 7 developing understanding <b>of</b> the <b>genre</b> set <b>of</b> resumes and cover letters, the multimodal <b>genre</b> <b>of</b> presentation slides, and four classroom and research genres. As they approached these tasks in various rhetorical contexts, the writers drew on diverse resources and strategies, dependent on their prior experience with the <b>genre,</b> the availability <b>of</b> <b>resources,</b> and the situational exigencies of the task. As tasks became more “high-stakes,” the writers marshaled their available resources, making visible leaps in knowledge development. With experience gained through instruction and/or disciplinary practice, the writers integrated their knowledge of generic form, procedures, rhetoric, and content, so that their <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> became increasingly sophisticated and automatic. Based on {{the findings of this study}} and previous studies in similar contexts, I offer a model <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> development for multilingual writers, defining individual, community, and task as the main parameters in the developmental process. This model takes into account both disciplinary practice and writing classroom instruction as sites for knowledge-building, integrating two domains that have traditionally been isolated in empirical studies <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> learning.

This study seeks to leverage authentic manuals on engineering devices in teaching organizational and linguistic features specific to a technical manual as a genre. Consciousness-raising tasks were designed to help a group of third-year medical engineering undergraduates in a Hong Kong university to write a manual on operating a portable electrocardiogram (a heartbeat measurement device). Questionnaire findings on students’ receptiveness of the approach will be discussed in terms of the relevance of learning materials, the perceived level of difficulty, and the enhancement of subject understanding and knowledge application. Post-study manual writing by students will also be examined with respect to the concepts applied and the avoidance of common pitfalls. Challenges to teachers, on the other hand, include the demand of time and subject-matter knowledge in materials selection. Recommendations will be offered on the use <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> to promote academic literacy in specific disciplines (Hyland, 2012), aiming to not only improve the quality of English-in-the-discipline teaching but also facilitate a potential partnership between subject-matter and language teachers...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} how {{a group of}} Chinese university students of English as a foreign language (EFL) learned an academic genre (thesis) in an English for academic purposes (EAP) writing course. Investigation focused on the students’ genre learning process, learner characteristics, and <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> development. The study was informed by a multifaceted theoretical framework that integrated sociocultural, second language (L 2) writing, and genre theories, and adopted a qualitative case study approach. Data were collected from interviews, participants’ process logs, their written texts, and curriculum documents. The study found that participants’ genre learning process comprised five recurrent modes of mediated learning in and outside the writing classroom, including: responding to explicit instructions, interacting with the course instructor, engaging in writing practice, responding to pedagogical tasks, and drawing on discipline-specific content courses. Analysis of learner characteristics revealed five salient individual factors that influenced participants’ genre learning: language proficiency, learner autonomy, previous L 2 writing experiences, critical awareness of generic conventions, and perception of discoursal identity. Examination <b>of</b> participants’ <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> showed that they obtained macro-level formal knowledge, but their micro-level formal knowledge, rhetorical knowledge, process knowledge, and subject-matter knowledge was still in development. Learners’ <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> development {{was found to be}} influenced by the learning process and learner characteristics. On the basis of these findings, an instruction-based genre learning model for Chinese EFL students has been proposed.

40|$|AbstractGenre {{literature}} {{has indicated that}} academic discourse communities commonly uphold established conventions {{with regard to the}} writing of research articles in their respective disciplines. Recent studies have also acknowledged that disciplinary differences exist in the writing of research articles, and this has resulted in numerous investigations into the specific <b>genre</b> features <b>of</b> this text type in various academic fields. An interesting area which has been identified in past research is a rhetorical move that evaluates the study being reported. To date, however, this move on self-evaluation has not been examined at length in a core academic discipline such as economics. Using the latest Swalesian move-step analytical framework, this study aims to analyse the communicative functions of this move in empirical economics research articles and identify its constituent steps. The textual analysis of this investigation was triangulated by a qualitative analysis of spoken data elicited from specialist informants in the field of economics. Our results indicate that self-evaluation of a study is, by and large, a principal or quasi-obligatory move although each of its three steps is optional in economics research reports. These three constituent steps collectively play a pivotal role in putting the research into perspective for the reader after research results are presented. The findings of this study have contributed to the advancement <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> in that they have shed some light on how instructors can design relevant teaching materials aimed at helping learners to foreground the value of their studies in the later portions of their research reports...|$|R

The particular focus we've chosen for this collection is papers by practitioners, writers of the real. The papers from the conference selected for this issue break down perceived institutional divisions between critical and creative practice and problematise simple separations of truth and fiction, art and the real. These contested binaries are often interrelated {{in the context of}} tertiary creative writing practice, where writers are also required to critically reflect on genre. Such discussions about the relationship between fact and fiction have set up something of a template for critical writing by writers of creative non-fiction, especially those studying for higher degrees. The engagement of these papers with critical and creative practice within the academy is supplemented by other papers dealing with the productive tensions between fact and fiction, creativity and critical analysis more broadly. The <b>resources</b> <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> are repeatedly invoked as a way of negotiating these divides, and the diversity of generic forms represented in this collection presses at the boundaries by which creative non-fiction might be defined...|$|R

40|$|Apprenticeship in {{academic}} prose is a transformative experience (Hayot, 2014), and this paper investigates {{the development of}} self-regulation in three bachelor (BA) literature essay writers using the theoretical lens of participatory appropriation by Rogoff (1990, 2008), which seeks to explain how individuals undergo processes of development thanks to, and in interaction with, the social interaction. Students who learn to self-regulate towards concrete, achievable writing goals obtain higher levels of writing performance, i. e. text quality (Rogers & Graham, 2008; Graham, McKeown, Kiuhara & Harris, 2012; Graham & Perin, 2007). Metacognitive skills are integral to the development <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> and rhetorical effectiveness (Negretti, 2015). We thus investigate how interaction with a supervisor helps students orient themselves towards genre/discipline-relevant writing goals, how do they self-regulate towards these goals, how it helps students aligning with the stakeholders’ (the examiners) evaluation {{of the quality of}} writing. Data was collected through in-depth, qualitative interviews at three points in the term; interview data was also collected from the examiners after defense. Data was coded and analyzed in NVivo, using Pintrich’s (2004) heuristic. Results show that frequently students explicitly reported on or imagined the interaction with their supervisor: a sort of “dialogic think-aloud”. These dialogues often discussed genre-relevant aspects such as what the essay should aim for (genre goals) and what would be the expectations to meet (genre criteria), providing the basis for a variety of SR behaviors. Despite its limitations, this investigation responds to calls for context-sensitive inquiries of self-regulation and metacognition, were individual development is highlighted {{against the backdrop of the}} social context in which it is embedded (Azevedo 2009; Pieschl, 2009) ...|$|R

40|$|Writing is a {{significant}} cognitive, educational, personal, and social activity. Children's perceptions of their writing impact significantly on their learning, and are clearly influenced by the instructional programmes and environments they encounter. Children's development as writers during their middle primary school years (years four to six) is significantly under- researched. Four key areas of children's perceptions are of interest to this study: knowledge, strategies, attributions, and attitudes. Consequently, this study seeks to understand children's perceptions of their writing, and the contexts within which these perceptions are developed. A six week ethnographic case study was undertaken, involving eight children and two teachers in one school. The data collection methods of participant observation, interviews, 'think alouds', and document analysis were used to gain a rich understanding of children's perceptions. Data was analysed and validated using qualitative methods. The findings show that children hold diverse and idiosyncratic global perceptions. Children demonstrate a range of knowledge and strategies that they bring to their writing. They are able to describe both common and novel attributions for their successes and failures. Children's attitudes are predictably diverse, and show a strong link with classroom programmes and environments. While children's perceptions are clearly influenced by the classroom programme and environment, this alone {{does not account for}} the uniqueness of children's perceptions. While the two teachers in this study offered different instructional experiences, both see metacognition and self-management as having an important role in children's learning. These findings suggest that knowledge and strategy use are of equal importance to middle primary children. Instructional practices loosely based on a cognitive apprenticeship model may be effective in making writing a knowledgeable, strategic, social, and authentic activity. The current curriculum inadequately conceptualises genre and pays only minimal attention to children's development <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge.</b> This study recommends that longitudinal research into the development of writing expertise in the middle primary years is needed...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades the {{attention}} of scholars working in the filed of academic discourse has been directed towards language variation, and academic writing is not any more considered as a consistent and homogeneous form of discourse. The importance traditionally given to the consensual and static aspects of disciplinary communication has been coupled with the emphasis increasingly placed {{to the analysis of}} interactions/practices/activities that sustain discourse communities. According to the sociolinguist approach, genres become ‘dynamically rhetorical structures’ that can be manoeuvred according to the discipline’s norms, values and ideology, both historically and incrementally changing as disciplinary <b>knowledge</b> and <b>genres</b> required and created by discourse communities change (Hyland 2004, 2009). This is all the more evident in the legal field, where ‘procedural knowledge and social knowledge’ (Bakhtin 1986; Brown et al. 1989) {{play a key role in}} the acquisition and strategically deployment <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> as academic writers participate in their ‘profession’s knowledge-producing activities’ (Berkenkotter & Huckin 2009). The aim of this paper is to explore the use of epistemic modality markers in a selection of issues of a number of international legal journals dealing with constitutional and Public Law & Administration, written in English and published between 1990 and 2010. In particular, emphasis will be given to the emerging constitution of European Community and the European Union and the interplay between law and politics. Starting from the generally agreed assumption (Hyland 1998; Vold 2006) that epistemic assessment of the information conveyed is a significant aspect of academic discourse, the present work focuses on differences/similarities in the use of a number of selected markers in the texts included in the corpus from a diachronic perspective.

40|$|Research Seminar PresentationTertiary {{students}} in EFL contexts like China are often {{faced with a}} gap between their limited command of L 2 (English) academic literacies and their much more developed L 1 academic literacies. Instead of just focusing on the L 2 limitations of the EFL academic writer, research can also look at how best one can help bridge this gap. There are two major dimensions {{to the task of}} academic writing: (1) the bottom-up dimension: selecting the appropriate kinds of lexico-grammatical resources—lexical phrases, and (2) the top-down dimension: planning the schematic structure of the text to achieve one’s overall communicative purpose through moves and steps, each with specific rhetorical functions. In view of the many Chinese university contexts where students are often taught in huge classrooms and accustomed to explicit instruction on general English skills with grammar exercises, this seminar will present a culturally appropriate pedagogical approach integrating genre-based pedagogies (Rose and Martin, 2012), lexical bundle studies (e. g. Biber & Barbieri, 2007; Cortes, 2004, 2013; Hyland, 2008) and move analysis of English for academic purposes (EAP) (Swales, 1990; Swale & Feak, 2004). The “teaching and learning cycle” of genre-based pedagogies (Rose & Martin, 2012) and corpus-informed explicit instruction are incorporated into an EAP genre-based approach for a better “text in context” exemplification <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> and genre-specific language features. Lexical phrases are focused upon as key EAP resources in the context <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> awareness including “general academic lexical phrases” (GALP) (e. g., 4 - 5 word “lexical bundles” such as “on the basis of”) selected through corpus frequency analysis, and “move-specific lexical phrases” (MLP) selected through qualitative genre analysis (Cai & Lin, 2012). MLPs are, in particular, taught as useful “frames” for expanding students’ repertoire <b>of</b> lexico-grammatical <b>resources</b> to realize different moves in a specific genre. This new distinction between GALP and MLP is made in an attempt to attend to both the frequency and variety of building blocks of academic texts in genre-based pedagogies, and also to model a good strategy for students’ own independent learning in different <b>genres</b> <b>of</b> academic writing...|$|R

Also, the author notes that engineering discourse genre paradigm, as a holistic and complex phenomenon, has not been finalized yet. So this issue needs to be investigated further. Features and common norms <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> are explained according to its communicative goal that is motivated by social context, where genre is formed. Moreover, the author notes that genre analysis has experienced changes and today it includes not only research of specific language features, but also social context, culture, ideology, structure, and activity of discourse community...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the nature of the}} second language acquisition (SLA) of eight international PhD students that occurred as they undertook the literature review when planning their doctoral research projects at a New Zealand university. While the social, cultural approaches have been seen as broadening the field of SLA by introducing diverse epistemologies (Ortega, 2012), their conceptions of the mind and cognition of the second language speaker as a social product, and of SLA as the outcome of social processes (see Atkinson, 2011 a), appear to be problematic in terms of understanding the central mechanisms of SLA. This study addresses this issue by explicating the mind and cognition of the participants and their SLA from a phenomenological realist perspective. Central to the theoretical framework for the study are Husserl’s (1970) realist ontology and epistemology, Widdowson’s (1983, 1990) theory of language learning through the negotiation of meaning and Bruce’s (2008 a) identification of extra-linguistic and linguistic areas <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> in an English-medium academic context while developing their literature reviews (LR). Interpretative phenomenological analysis (Smith, Flowers & Larkin, 2009) was used as the overarching methodology to investigate the ontology of the participants, their epistemological processing, and their acquisition of academic English. This involved analysing monthly interviews with individual participants and supplementary data collected during a six-month conditional enrolment period. In addition, an analysis of the actual LR texts of five participants was undertaken to examine the textual outcomes of the LR process. This analysis focused, in particular, on <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> and logicality as critical elements of the academic competence that the participants were engaged in developing. The findings of the study suggest that intentionality as a cognitive process was what enabled the participants to engage with social processes {{in the course of their}} SLA. Thought and language, as two separate entities in the knowledge of the participants, seemed to interact hierarchically in the process of undertaking the LR. Their SLA seemed to occur through this hierarchical thought-language operation, which involved participants drawing on and using new linguistic and procedural resources to express their thought. In addition, the thought of the participants seemed not to be constrained or regulated by linguistic and rhetorical systems (either from their first language or English). Rather, in their efforts to engage with disciplinary knowledge when processing and communicating the meaning of academic texts intended by the authors, participants went beyond such cultural frames. Significantly, this meaning-uncovering intentionality appeared to facilitate parallel SLA. While advice and feedback from other members of their particular community appeared to be important to their SLA, it was not evident that social interaction was the central, facilitative process. Moreover, the overall findings of the study suggest a need to expand the scope of what constitutes SLA in academic contexts. That is, developing competence in using academic English appeared to involve not only the acquisition <b>of</b> linguistic <b>resources,</b> but also developing extra-linguistic <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> that ensures textual coherence, in order to communicate intended thought including logicality and criticality successfully...|$|R

40|$|In EFL {{contexts}} like China where {{research and}} application of findings {{in the field of}} English for Academic Purposes (EAP) is still in its infancy, graduate students are in urgent need of support in developing their academic literacy, especially in terms of academic writing and research article writing skills under the forces of globalization of education. This study sets out to develop a contextualized EAP genre-based approach to scaffold novice academic writers and examine its impact through assessment tasks and analysis of students’ uptake. The theoretical traditions of ESP research article (RA) genre analysis (e. g. Swales, 1990, 2004; Swale & Feak, 2004) and lexical bundle studies (e. g. Biber & Barbieri, 2007; Hyland, 2008) are drawn upon and two dimensions of building blocks of academic discourse are conceptualized: the top-down dimension (i. e., genre schematic structuring) and the bottom-up dimension(i. e. general and move-specific academic lexical phrases). Then, the Sydney School genre-based Teaching and Learning Cycle and corpus-informed explicit bundle instruction were incorporated into the ESP genre-based framework to generate a new theoretical and pedagogical model taking into consideration the needs of the local context. In order to evaluate this innovative course thoroughly in a natural and intact classroom, careful triangulations of data were achieved. A mixed-methods programme evaluation framework was developed with two major components, namely an intervention study and individual case studies. In terms of the average gains of the whole class, there was significant improvement in the receptive test <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> and bundles after the course. In addition, the instruction significantly narrowed the achievement gap among the high, mid and low starting level students. Most importantly, the increase in the appropriate use of lexical phrases in rewriting suggests the effectiveness of the course in enabling active production. Regression analysis further indicated a strong relationship between the development of bundle <b>knowledge</b> and that <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> and genre-specific features. The rich descriptions of the two student cases delineate the different learning trajectories of learners of distinct starting levels. Although the low starting level learner showed much slower in-class uptake, her active engagement and integration of knowledge in the rewriting task by drawing on various resources has increased her understanding <b>of</b> the RA <b>genre.</b> The high starting level learner with satisfactory in-class uptake, however, suffered from lots of textual borrowing in writing due to her high expectation of academic content but lack <b>of</b> corresponding <b>genre</b> and linguistic competences. The fact that both learners exhibited a strong lack <b>of</b> basic linguistic <b>resources</b> to verbalize their sophisticated thinking in the rewriting task pointed to the importance of developing the linguistic aspects in the initial stage <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> development in EFL contexts, which has been neglected in previous studies focusing on ESL contexts. The careful investigation of the instructional context has led to detailed discussions of a few prominent issues in the pedagogical design, in particular, the importance of focusing on the role of “task” in curriculum and pedagogical design in future research of genre-based pedagogy. published_or_final_versionEducationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

This article reads The Globe and Mail columns of Christie Blatchford as a practical example of pragmatic objectivity. Blending com-plex ethotic appeals with straightforward reportage, these columns constitute a kind <b>of</b> hybrid <b>genre,</b> which gives Blatchford scope to construct herself as reliable even as she con-cedes that reportorial objectivity {{in the traditional sense}} is impossible. Her writing on Canada’s mission in Afghanistan, however, is problematic.

40|$|Drawing upon 21 {{months of}} ethnographic {{research}} in West Gao District of Santa Isabel, Solomon Islands, this thesis argues that relationships of absolute difference or 'alterity,' existing internally to one society, {{are central to}} processes of social reproduction. At the deepest level of ontology the West Gao lived world {{is based on a}} priori difference between three discrete categories of being. Each category - a matriclan, or kokolo - consists of a relational amalgam <b>of</b> <b>genres</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> human persons, and ancestral beings. These relationships are unified, bounded, and rendered distinct by virtue of a shared, inherent connection to a discrete territory. From a cosmogonic perspective, in isolation the three kokolo cannot reproduce their distinctiveness. To do so they must enter into relationships with each other. Consequently, two different forms of socio-cosmic relationships become crucial for understanding land-person connectivity in West Gao: those flowing internally to each exogamous matriclan; and those forged between different matriclans. I explore how these two forms of relationships are continually balanced against one another in both quotidian practices and ritualised exchanges. Whilst this balance is dictated by the poly-ontological structure of West Gao cosmology, I illustrate how the balance shifts in response to historical and politico-economic processes, in particular, conversion to Christianity and the increasing value of land as a monetary resource. Participant observation, extended interviews in Solomon Islands Pijin and the local vernacular - Gao, and two weeks of archival research in the National Library of Australia comprised the main methodologies used. I draw upon this data in seven analytical chapters that address: the role of ancestral agency in the shaping of historical processes; the 'ancestral' dynamics of Christian communities; place, personhood, and movement; origin narratives; the trans-generational reproduction of matrilineal identity; ritualised exchanges focused on the 'father-child' relationship; and practices surrounding mortality and burial...|$|R
40|$|This work investigates {{emerging}} knowledge distribution means {{through a}} descriptive study. Despite {{the amount of}} attention that processes and structures for knowledge management has received within research during the last decade, little attention has been directed towards the actual means used for the distribution of knowledge by individuals. In this respect it is the aim of the study to contribute with knowledge regarding knowledge distribution means. The study consists of a survey of emerging electronically mediated distribution means followed with a characterization and analysis. For the characterization and analysis a framework for interpretation of the different distribution means was created based on the constructs of organizational learning and the levels of knowledge system interpretation. Within the framework characteristics and concepts were identified and then used for the analysis of the knowledge distribution means. The characterization of the different knowledge distribution means as such may be used as an instrument for evaluation since it generalizable to other means of knowledge distribution. The results of the study show that knowledge distribution is not an isolated event. It takes place in larger context, such as organizational learning, since it touches upon other activities or phenomena such as knowledge acquisition, knowledge interpretation, and organizational memory. The concept <b>of</b> <b>genre</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> distribution was found to be a viable concept to base exploration and development of support for knowledge distribution. The investigated distribution means only partly support a model for knowledge representation that captures both the problem-solution as well as an understanding of their relationship. In this respect existing distribution means must be enhanced or new ones developed if we wish to endorse such a representational model.

I review briefly the diversity of approaches to theorizing <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and then present the dual social genre/cognitive genre approach that I have used as a basis for research and course design in an EAP context. I exemplify this model by summarizing the key elements of two studies <b>of</b> research <b>genres</b> in which I have used this model.

Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, this study borrows the framework of calibration from educational psychology to highlight the relationship between the accuracy of graduate students’ metacognitive judgments and the quality of their texts. Within an authentic setting, the nature of metacognitive judgments is calibrated against the assessment of rhetorical effectiveness by teacher raters using genre analysis criteria. Findings show that individual differences in rhetorical effectiveness can be better understood when accuracy of metacognitive judgments is considered along two qualitative dimensions: depth and alignment. Differential achievement relates to the ability to apply <b>genre</b> <b>knowledge</b> to the text, and misalignments in task perceptions and criteria.
