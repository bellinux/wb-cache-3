While the isolated experiment may be the hope and the despair of the scientist who conducts it, its results are seldom inspiring to the outside reader. Only when the results of numerous individual studies are brought into conjunction with one another does a general theoretical housing emerge that makes the numerous individual studies seem worthwhile to the outside observer.

Finally, in a more substantive manner, I collected executive statements, published NASA policy statements, and structural reviews of the NASA program. Overall, I was able to collect both empirical and substantive data for an accurate depiction of U. S. space policy. Through my research I was able to uncover an evolving policy of absolute defensive control to strategic economic control of orbital resources, amidst global competition. In this manner, I argue the U.

Control over space, in this regard, focuses on the creation of normal practices and justification of one’s presence in space...|$|R

After co-cultivation of Schizochytrium protoplasts with A. tumefaciens harboring pCAMBIA 2301 containing the neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT II) gene as the selectable marker which confers resistance to G 418, the Schizochytrium transformants were successfully obtained on the G 418 -containing plates. The integration and expression of the transgenes were confirmed by PCR analysis and GUS activity assay. To further validate the transformation system, pCAMBIA 2301 -EGFP containing the egfp gene was introduced into Schizochytrium. The following results demonstrated that the exogenous egfp gene has been successfully incorporated into the genome of Schizochytrium. In addition, the introduced egfp gene expressed efficiently according to the Western blot and fluorescence assay results. More importantly, {{the majority of the}} transformants displayed similar biomass and fatty acid production comparing with the wild type strain. Our results demonstrated that exogenous genes could be expressed efficiently in transgenic Schizochytrium, suggesting that genetically engineered Schizochytrium could be explored by this system.

40|$|Purpose – Value {{appropriation}} is a central, yet neglected aspect {{in business}} exchange research. The {{purpose of the}} paper is to generate an overview of research on active value appropriation in business exchange and provide the foundation for further <b>research</b> into value <b>appropriation,</b> {{as well as some}} initial guidance for managers. Design/methodology/approach – Literatures investigating value appropriation were identified by the means of a systematic review of the overall management literature. Findings – The authors provide an overview and comparison of the literatures and find that they apply diverse understandings of the value appropriation process and emphasize different mechanisms and outcomes of value <b>appropriation.</b> <b>Research</b> limitations/implications – Based on the literature comparison and discussion, in combination with inspiration from alternative business exchange literature, the authors propose four areas with high potential for future research into value appropriation: network position effects, appropriation acts and behaviors, buyer-seller relationship effects, and appropriation over time. Practical implications – Boundary spanning managers acting in industrial markets must master the difficult balance between value creation and appropriation. This review has provided an overview of the many managerial options for value appropriation and created knowledge on the effects of the various appropriation mechanisms enabling managers to secure company rents while not jeopardizing value creation. Originality/value – To the authors’ knowledge, this paper represents the first attempt at reviewing the management literature on value appropriation in business exchange. The authors provide overview, details, comparisons, and frame a research agenda as a first step towards establishing value appropriation as a key phenomenon in business exchange research.

40|$|The global poultry {{sector is}} divided into a {{large-scale}} commercial sector dominated by international, highly vertically integrated companies, and a small-scale sector that provides up to 90 percent of total poultry production {{in some of the}} least developed countries. The fast reproduction cycle, low unit costs, economies of scale in <b>research</b> and <b>appropriation</b> and control of the produce are driving factors in the commercial sector. Private research concentrates on technologies that are likely to result in market applications and returns to investment. Private incentives for animal research are strongest where markets for improved technology are large, technical advances can be made quickly, and intellectual property can be protected. To-date, technological protection strategies and contractual practices, rather than formal intellectual property rights strategies, have dominated in the commercial poultry sector. Poultry breeders have developed a highly successful way of protecting their intellectual property investment in superior breeds by exploiting heterosis, and the deleterious segregation of hybrid stocks in the next generation. Thus, by restricting access to the pure parent line stock (a form of trade secret) and selling F 1 generation birds, a breeder remains the sole supplier of useful material. Patents do not yet play a role in poultry breeding, but breeding for disease resistance might change this in the future...|$|R

Understanding appropriation is a key problem for developing interactive systems, since it {{critical to the success of}} technology deployment. It is also an important <b>research</b> issue, since <b>appropriation</b> lies at the intersection of workplace studies and design. Most accounts of <b>appropriation</b> in the <b>research</b> literature have taken a social perspective. In contrast, this paper explores appropriation in terms of the technical features that support it.

These principles are particularly relevant to component-based approaches to system design that blur the traditional application boundaries...|$|R

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread environmental contaminants, which {{are known to}} be carcinogenic and teratogenic. These compounds cause a range of macroscopic malformations, particularly to the craniofacial apparatus and cardiovascular system during vertebrate development. However, little is known concerning microscopic effects, especially on the sensitive early life stages or on the molecular basis of developmental neurotoxicity. Using the rockfish (Sebastiscus marmoratus), we explored the neurodevelopmental defects caused by early-life exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of pyrene, a 4 -ring PAH. The results showed that pyrene substantially disrupted the cranial innervation pattern and caused deficiency of motor nerves. The expression of a protein associated with axon growth, growth associated protein 43, was decreased in the central nervous system after treatment with pyrene. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) plays a vital role in a variety of processes, including neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal survival and death. Our results showed that the expression of Ca 2 +/calmodulin dependent kinase II and cAMP-response element-binding, which belong to the NMDAR pathway, were increased in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to pyrene. Acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter which is known to suppress retinal cells neurite outgrowth, was increased by pyrene exposure. Nitric oxide (NO) acts as an activity-dependent retrograde signal that can coordinate axonal targeting and synaptogenesis during development. The level of NO was decreased in a dose-dependent manner following exposure to pyrene. Taken together, the defects in neurodevelopment and the damage to related mechanisms provided the basis for {{a better understanding of the}} neurotoxic effects of pyrene. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This poster {{presents}} my PhD <b>research</b> {{about the}} <b>appropriation</b> {{of the practice}} of mobile music listening. Following an exploratory phase, I have described and interpreted some of the salient characteristics of that practice. It broadly shows that it is an automatic, background, unfocused listening used as an accompaniment to another activity. The music is therefore functional: it helps to relax, change mood, block unwanted sounds (or people), make non-places (Augé, 1992) more pleasant. This banal practice of mobile music listening can be described as an experience of ‘self-resonance’ (Rosa, 2012) from the listener. I argue that, besides this ‘art de faire’ (De Certeau, 1980), the technology of mobile listening affords another practice, at the extreme opposite, that stresses the creativity of the listener. This way of listening is characterized by a close attention to the music and the sound, a limitation of multitasking, a pre-listening preparation time, the playlist as a mean to appropriate a music collection, the use of random listening to discover hidden gems or unforeseen musical associations. A forthcoming ethnography of this practice will test this hypothesis and probably define new combinations of variables...|$|R

Using data derived from a questionnaire survey among librarians at UWC in South Africa and NUST in Zimbabwe, this study examined how librarians use social media for professional and personal purposes. The findings suggest that UWC librarians are more proficient social media users than NUST librarians. They further reveal that UWC librarians themselves are managing social media, while at NUST, the Information Technology department is directly responsible for managing the platforms. The study found that UWC Library utilises social media to promote its services more widely, whereas the NUST Library uses social media for reference services. DHE...|$|R

If appropriation has to take place for a dwelling to “work optimal”, the ownership should be privately owned. Low effort mostly combines with low possibilities (for example: the sliding walls flexible housing project by Duinker/vd Torre). In the design project, I wanted to create a certain flexibility in the dwellings. However, climate and structural issues ask for expensive and complex solutions, which {{are not likely to be}} applied and/or used in every day practice. Therefore, I “limited” the flexibility to a fixed zone and a service zone, where the service zone allows for flexibility. The fixed zone makes the building stable and strong (prefab concrete load bearing walls with precast plate flooring, whereas the service zone provides flexibility by using a Slimline+floor with a lowered ceiling. In this zone pipes and wires come together to two shafts. In this way, the basic envelope of one dwelling allows for stacking this envelope into row houses, maisonettes or separate maisonettes. By also placing a steel lintel in the prefabricated load bearing walls, openings/passages can be made through the dwellings on horizontal level, allowing for horizontal linking.
