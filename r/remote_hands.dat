40|$|In {{master-slave}} manipulators, forces {{encountered by}} the <b>remote</b> <b>hand</b> are transmitted {{back to the}} operator. A t very great distances {{there will be a}} transmission delay between an operator‘s movement and a resulting force. Znvestigation was made of the effect of long delays and differences in strategy on positioning time with force feedback alone. Positioning could be accomplished, but delay coupled with high loop gain creates serious instability. Experimental results suggest that alternative displays of the feedback force can overcome the stability problem...|$|R

50|$|A NOC {{engineer}} {{has several}} duties {{in order to}} ensure the smooth running of the network. They deal with things such as DDoS Attacks, power outages, network failures, and routing black-holes. There are of course the basic roles, such as <b>remote</b> <b>hands,</b> support, configuration of hardware (such as firewalls and routers, purchased by a client). NOC engineers also have to ensure the core network is stable. This can be done by configuring hardware {{in a way that makes}} the network more secure, but still has optimal performance. NOC engineers are also responsible for monitoring activity, such as network usage, temperatures etc. They would also have to install equipment, such as KVMs, rack installation, IP-PDU setup, running cabling. The majority of NOC engineers are also on call and have a 5-6 day rotation, working different shifts.|$|E
40|$|The {{new tools}} for {{education}} of engineering emerged {{and one of}} the most promising is a remote rapid control prototyping (RRCP), which is very useful also for control and robotics development in industry and in education. Examples of introductory remote control and simple robotic. courses with integrated hand, on experiments are presented in the paper. The aim o/: integration of <b>remote</b> <b>hand</b> on experiments into control and/or robotics course is to minimize the gap between the theory and practice to teach students the use of RRCP and to decrease the education costs. Developed RRCP experiments are based on MATLAB/Simulink, xPC target, custom developed embedded target for DSP- 2 controller and LabVIEW virtual instrument...|$|R

50|$|The game {{consists}} of eight worlds, {{each of which}} {{consists of}} three levels. In each level, the screen will scroll constantly in one direction. The direction depends {{on the stage and}} Wii <b>Remote</b> <b>Hand.</b> Players must collect a pearl to complete the level. To collect a pearl, players will need to find three medals. Medals are hidden within each stage, and are also carry medals into view. If the player falls back {{to the edge of the}} screen for too long, he/she will get eaten by Hydracoil, and will lose a life. If the player loses all of his/her lives, the game is over. If the players collects a pearl in all three levels, a boss stage is unlocked in each world. The world is cleared after the player beats the boss.|$|R
40|$|To perform {{advanced}} {{manipulation of}} remote environments such as grasping, {{more than one}} finger is required implying higher requirements for the control architecture. This paper presents the design and control of a modular 3 -finger haptic device {{that can be used}} to interact with virtual scenarios or to teleoperate dexterous <b>remote</b> <b>hands.</b> In a modular haptic device, each module allows the interaction with a scenario by using a single finger; hence, multi-finger interaction can be achieved by adding more modules. Control requirements for a multifinger haptic device are analyzed and new hardware/software architecture for these kinds of devices is proposed. The software architecture described in this paper is distributed and the different modules communicate to allow the remote manipulation. Moreover, an application in which this haptic device is used to interact with a virtual scenario is shown...|$|E

40|$|A {{computer-assisted}} teleoperator {{control system}} for making comparative performance evaluations is described. A local and {{a remote control}} station, each with decision-making capability, {{communicate with each other}} through a simulated time delay. Supervisory control at three increasingly automatic levels is possible. The highest level of programmed control is facilitated through the ARM language which was developed to permit easily readable program manuscripts to be written and assembled into programs of motions by novice programmers. Experimental results show the advantage of this form of supervisory control with both direct and delayed (3 sec) manipulation tasks. In addition, two systems to measure and reproduce force distributions have been designed. One system reproduces contact on the external surfaces of the <b>remote</b> <b>hand</b> using 21 airjet simulators. Another system reproduces the shape of the contact between object and jaws using 288 piezoelectric (bimorph) stimulators...|$|R

50|$|The Black Knight {{is capable}} of being used {{off-road}} meaning that it go through any type of terrain such as rocks or water. The vehicle is used in military tests that allows Soldiers {{to figure out the}} major roles of the tank in order to use it in a more advanced military force. Because of its autonomous and semi-autonomous (being able to control itself and be controlled by someone else) components this helps operators plan an efficient plan of attack as well as avoiding obstacles while finding its way from point A to point B. It also consists of three modules: the Robotics Operator, the Mission Commander, and the Safety Officer each serving their own purpose. The Black Knight is basically operated through the Robotics Operator Control Station (ROCS) which is inside an armed vehicle. Meaning that it controls the remote and autonomous operations while the Mission Commander has the task of reading the data and then transferring it to the whole system allowing it to better direct the robotics operator. The Safety Officer controls the <b>remote</b> <b>hand</b> controller which is used when there's an unsafe situation and an emergency stop command is needed. Its main role is to insure the safety of those around the vehicle and after each task, it needs to be remotely parked in a certain location like a garage or onto a truck.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Home {{exercise}} {{programs are}} {{an important component of}} a hand therapy rehabilitation program. Compliance with the recommended home exercise regime is generally considered essential for good treatment outcomes. The aim of this pilot was to determine the clarity of an innovative hand therapy DVD. This DVD will be utilised in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) examining the usefulness of DVD technology for enhancing treatment compliance for rural and <b>remote</b> <b>hand</b> therapy patients. Methods: A series of seven DVDs of previously utilised home exercise protocols were taped and edited by the researchers. The pilot used a convenience sample of nine consecutive consenting patients who attended the Hand Therapy Service at a regional hospital in North Queensland. Subjects viewed a DVD that related to their clinical diagnosis and then completed a questionnaire on the suitability of the research instrument. Results: There were unanimously positive responses to the DVD from all subjects, with 100 % indicating yes to the prompt questions. No negative comments were received. Discussion: The DVDs produced were found to be clear and useful for a group of hand therapy patients characteristically similar to those who will be recruited into the RCT. Resulting compliance with these home exercises will be presented in a subsequent paper resulting from the RCT. Given the poor health outcomes generally associated with patients from rural and remote areas, this endeavour contributes to the ongoing effort to improve service delivery to better address the health needs of rural and remote patients...|$|R

40|$|This book {{lays out}} {{empirical}} and methodological underpinnings {{for studying the}} early period of anti-cigarette legislation in the United States by overcoming the lack of primary source-based historical scholarship. Constantly repeating wildly erroneous claims at second, third, and more <b>remote</b> <b>hand,</b> anti-smoking academics and pro-tobacco apologists have fundamentally distorted history, {{on the one hand}} by dismissing the early anti-cigarette movement as merely religiously and morally motivated and the legislation it secured as unenforced exercises bereft of historical relevance, and, on the other by absurdly magnifying its achievements. Reconstruction of the national scope of the real course of the passage and repeal of statewide legislative bans on cigarette sales to adults from the late 1880 s until 1927 pays special attention to the non-governmental driving forces of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union’s health-based support of and the monopolistic American Tobacco Company’s opposition to such interference with consumer freedom. In this panoramic analysis is embedded ultra-thick description of the enactment, enforcement, and repeal processes in Iowa as a representative state. In order to present the full sweep of tobacco control regulation, the narrative continues into the present, under the new circumstances of a mass movement and monolithic scientific warnings of secondhand smoke exposure’s lethality, by capturing the shift in focus to anti-public smoking legislation—which had, ironically, originated just as sales ban repeals were spreading in the wake of World War I—again using developments in Iowa, interpretively enriched by interviews with numerous legislative, executive, administrative, and nongovernmental actors, as a sequence of microcosms.

40|$|In {{surgical}} education, two of {{the current}} primary assessment tools for technical skills are the OSATS checklist and electromagnetic (EM) hand tracking. There are few bench models available for open procedures. The first two chapters of this thesis introduce these concepts further and provide detailed background knowledge. Chapter 3 explores interference that may from the concurrent use of EM tracking and cautery, finding that monopolar cautery interferes, while bipolar cautery does not. Chapter 4 discusses the validation of an assessment tool for open cholecystectomies (OCs) consisting of a porcine bench model and a Wii remote based infrared (IR) hand tracking system. The assessment tool is found to have construct validity and the face validity of the OC model is established.

50|$|As oceans industrialise, {{conflicts}} are increasing among the users of marine space. This competition for marine space is developing {{in a context}} where natural resources {{can be seen as}} publicly owned. There can be conflict with the tourism industry, recreational fishers, wild harvest fisheries and the siting of marine renewable energy installations. The problems can be aggravated by the remoteness of many marine areas, and difficulties with monitoring and enforcement. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>remote</b> sites can be chosen that avoid conflicts with other users, and allow large scale operations with resulting economies of scale. Offshore systems can provide alternatives for countries with few suitable inshore sites, like Spain.|$|R
30|$|Because {{internal}} cognitive styles {{prefer to}} work alone {{rather than in}} a group, it would follow that employees with internal cognitive styles would be well-suited to remote work and this match between their cognitive style and the situation would probably be associated with high levels of commitment [26]. This means that people with internal cognitive styles will have greater commitment to working remotely than people with external cognitive styles. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>remote</b> workers seeking out interaction with their virtual team members [..] have been shown to increase identification with and commitment to coworkers [29]. Thus, people with external cognitive styles will have greater commitment to the virtual team than people with internal cognitive styles [26].|$|R
40|$|Kinematics of {{reaching}} and grasping are observed for prehension {{performed by the}} hand (natural prehension) and with a simple grasper held in the <b>hand</b> (<b>remote</b> prehension).
