Firstly, {{based on}} the {{theories}} and methods of acoustic intensity measurement, the surface radiation noise of the rear driving axle of minibus was tested in the bench experiment.

In this system, a micro-energy pulse power supply whose open voltage and capacitance can be adjusted is developed. The detection and control subsystem of the machining process is designed and applied. A simple method of machining high precision microelectrodes is adopted. The forming mechanism of the gap in EDM process is analyzed theoretically.

40|$|The {{advantages}} of glass fiber reinforced composites (FRP) and SIPs (structural insulated panels) are combined, {{and a new}} type of sandwich panel called composite structural insulated panels (CSIPs) is proposed. Through the adhesive bonding, CSIPs are made of FRP as face sheets and expanded polyethylene foam (EPS) as a core. To master the mechanical characteristics of CSIPs, firstly, adopting the large deflection theory of Reissener in this paper derived the calculation formula of displacement and the stability critical load of CSIPs. Then, ANSYS software was used to carry on the analysis of finite element simulation. Finally, a testing piece of CSIP with length 1000 mm and breath 1000 mm was made and a test was done. The results show that the theoretical analysis results, finite element simulation results and test <b>results</b> are <b>basically</b> <b>coincide.</b> So the calculating formula of deformation and bearing capacity of CSIPs are correct.

40|$|Thermal stress {{simulation}} {{can provide}} a scientific reference to eliminate defects such as crack, residual stress centralization and deformation etc., caused by thermal stress during casting solidification. To study the thermal stress distribution during casting process, a unilateral thermal-stress coupling model was employed to simulate 3 D casting stress using Finite Difference Method (FDM), namely all the traditional thermal-elastic-plastic equations are numerically and differentially discrete. A FDM/FDM numerical simulation system was developed to analyze temperature and stress fields during casting solidification process. Two practical verifications were carried out, and the <b>results</b> from simulation <b>basically</b> <b>coincided</b> with practical cases. The {{results indicated that the}} FDM/FDM stress simulation system can be used to simulate the formation of residual stress, and to predict the occurrence of hot tearing. Because heat transfer and stress analysis are all based on FDM, they can use the same FD model, which can avoid the matching process between different models, and hence reduce temperature-load transferring errors. This approach makes the simulation of fluid flow, heat transfer and stress analysis unify into one single model...|$|R
40|$|A certain {{formation}} pressure level {{must be kept}} due to the threshold pressure of the low-permeability reser-voir during the seepage. Advanced water injection can keep the {{formation pressure}} {{at a higher level}} and keep a higher pressure gradient, which is an effective way to develop low-permeability reservoir.

30|$|In Appendix B: Table 6 {{we explore}} {{the shape of}} the {{relation}} between technical change and early retirement. In particular, we check whether our results are robust to the order of the polynomial that we use to approximate the dependence. The linear approximation of column (2) yields a positive and statistically significant coefficient associated to technical change. The linear predicted probability crosses exactly the non-linear prediction of the benchmark regression, {{while the rest of the}} covariates is virtually the same up to the third digit. In column (3) the polynomial of order 3 yields a coefficient for the cube of the technical change which is not statistically significant. Moreover, the magnitude of the three key coefficients implies a prediction that <b>basically</b> <b>coincides</b> with the prediction of the benchmark quadratic approximation within the actual support of technical changes. Hence, the quadratic term of benchmark regression alone seems to capture most of the non-linearity in the relation.|$|R

40|$|International audienceA typical {{tendency}} in modern remote sensing (RS) {{is to apply}} multichannel systems. Images formed by them are in more or less degree noisy. Thus, their pre-filtering {{can be used for}} different purposes, in particular, to improve classification. In this paper, we consider methods of multichannel image denoising based on discrete cosine transform (DCT) and analyze how parameters of these methods affect classification. Both component-wise and 3 D denoising is studied for three-channel Landsat test image. It is shown that for better determination of different classes, DCT based filters, both component-wise and 3 D variants are efficient, but with a different tuning of involved parameters. The parameters can be optimized with respect to either standard MSE or metrics that characterize image visual quality. Best results are obtained with 3 D denoising. Although the main conclusions <b>basically</b> <b>coincide</b> for both considered classifiers, Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the classification results appear slightly better with RBF NN for the experiment carried out in this paper...|$|R

We {{show that}} for all p> pc(Z d) {{percolation}} parameters, {{the probability that the}} cluster of the origin is finite but has at least t vertices at distance one from the infinite cluster is exponentially small in t. Then we use this to give a very short proof of the important fact that the isoperimetric profile of the infinite cluster <b>basically</b> <b>coincides</b> with the profile of the original lattice. This implies for instance that simple random walk on the largest cluster of a finite box [−n,n] d with high probability has L ∞-mixing time Θ(n 2), and that the heat kernel (return probability) on the infinite cluster a. s. decays like pn(o, o) = O(n −d/ 2).
