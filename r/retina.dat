5|$|Other {{differences}} between the principal and secondary eyes are that the latter have rhabdomeres that point away from incoming light, just like in vertebrates, while the arrangement is the opposite in the former.

5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with the right side of the body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the <b>retina,</b> in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the <b>retina</b> go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the <b>retina</b> receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E

Threshold (whitening) and subthreshold (nonwhitening) laser burns were made in <b>retinas</b> of normal and Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats and normal and rds mice.

40|$|Neoangiogenesis is a {{response}} to retinal hypoxia that is inhibited by somatostatin (SRIF) through its subtype 2 receptor (sst 2). Using a mouse model of hypoxia-induced retinopathy, we investigated the possibility that inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) is involved in SRIF anti-angiogenic actions. Hypoxia increased AC responsiveness in wild type (WT) <b>retinas</b> and in <b>retinas</b> lacking sst 2, but not in sst 2 -overexpressing <b>retinas.</b> Hypoxia also altered AC isoform expression, but with different patterns depending on sst 2 expression level. Among the nine AC isoforms, AC VII isoform mRNA and protein resulted the most affected. Indeed, in hypoxia AC VII expression was significantly enhanced in WT <b>retinas</b> and it was further increased in sst 2 -lacking <b>retinas,</b> but not in <b>retinas</b> overexpressing sst 2. These data suggest an involvement of AC/cAMP in mediating both hypoxia-evoked retinal neoangiogenesis and SRIF protective actions.

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} effect of {{rhodopsin}} mutations on cone photoreceptors in human <b>retinas</b> with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Methods: Four RP <b>retinas</b> with rhodopsin mutations and four normal <b>retinas</b> were examined by immunofluorescence with a battery of cell-specific antibodies against cone and rod cytoplasmic and outer segment membrane proteins. Areas of the <b>retinas</b> were studied that showed maximal preservation of photoreceptor structure. Results: All four RP <b>retinas</b> showed loss of rods, ranging from mild (T- 17 -M), to more severe (P- 23 -H), to advanced degeneration (Q- 64 -ter and G- 106 -R). The majority of cones in the T- 17 -M and P- 23 -H <b>retinas</b> were cytologically normal but showed loss of immunoreactivity for the cytoplasmic proteins 7 G 6, calbindin, and X-arrestin. The cone outer segments (OS) remained positive for cone opsins and peripherin- 2 (rds/peripherin). All remaining cones in the Q- 64 -ter and G- 106 -R <b>retinas</b> were degenerate, with short to absent OS, but had strong reactivity for these cytoplasmic and OS membrane markers. Cones in the maculas of the RP <b>retinas</b> were degenerate, with short to absent OS, but retained strong labeling for the cytoplasmic and OS proteins. Conclusions: Even before cones show cytologic changes in response to rod cell degeneration, they lose immunoreactivity for certain cytoplasmic proteins. These cones later show shortening and loss of OS, although their OS membrane proteins remain well labeled. Cones may down regulate expression of both cytoplasmic and outer segment membrane proteins in response to mutant rod cell dysfunction and/or cell death in human RP <b>retinas.</b> Such cytologic and immunocytochemical changes in the cones may presage death of these critical cells in the later stages of RP...|$|R

D- 1 agonist-promoted accumulation of cAMP {{in the presence of}} adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) and 5 '-guanylylimidodiphosphate (GppNHp) was then measured. <b>Retinas</b> and striata incubated with DA or (+) SKF 38393 (100 microM each) displayed diminished capacities to accumulate cAMP when they were re-exposed to the same drugs. As expected, <b>retinas</b> and striata treated wtih (+) SKF 38393 also showed an attenuated formation of cAMP when restimulated with DA. In addition, D- 1 receptors in <b>retinas</b> that had been treated with quinpirole, a D- 2 agonist, did not become desensitized. Furthermore, 0. 2 microM SCH 23390 prevented D- 1 receptor subsensitivity caused by 100 microM DA.

Besides the well-known vascular abnormality, retinal dysfunction has also been reported even after ROP has resolved. We previously showed that deficiency of aldose reductase (AR), the rate-limiting enzyme in the polyol pathway, protected neonatal vasculature. Here, we further investigated the effects of AR deficiency on various retinal neurons using the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), a well-established model of ROP. METHOD: Seven-day-old mouse pups were exposed to 75 % oxygen for 5 days and then returned to room air. Vascular obliteration was analyzed on isolectin-stained retinal flat-mounts. Immunohistochemistry for calbindin (horizontal cell marker), PKCα (rod bipolar cell marker), calretinin (amacrine cell marker), Tuj 1 (retinal ganglion cell marker), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), nitrotyrosine (NT), and poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) was performed on retinal sections. The results were compared between wild-type (WT) and AR-deficient (AR-/-) <b>retinae</b> on P 14 and P 17 (P, postnatal). RESULTS: On P 14, calbindin and calretinin immunoreactivity was decreased in WT OIR <b>retinae</b> while PKCα immunoreactivity was significantly increased in AR-/- OIR <b>retinae.</b> But {{no significant differences were found}} for Tuj 1. Yet, more intense GFAP immunoreactivity in Müller cell processes was observed in AR-/- OIR <b>retinae.</b> Increased NT and nuclear PAR immunoreactivity were found in WT OIR <b>retinae</b> but not in AR-/- OIR <b>retinae.</b> On P 17, calbindin immunoreactivity was decreased in WT OIR <b>retinae</b> while PKCα-positive cell bodies appeared to be less prominent in AR-/- OIR <b>retinae.</b> Markedly reduced calretinin immunoreactivity, seriously distorted three strata in IPL and decreased cell bodies in INL were observed in central retinal area in WT OIR <b>retinae</b> but not in AR-/- OIR <b>retinae.</b> Again, no significant differences were found in Tuj 1 immunoreactivity. GFAP immunoreactivity was significantly increased in WT OIR <b>retinae.</b> Importantly, significantly reduced NT and nuclear PAR immunoreactivity were observed in AR-/- OIR <b>retinae.</b> CONCLUSION: Our results not only demonstrated the retinal neuronal changes in the mouse model of OIR, but also showed that these changes appeared to be prominent in central avascular area, indicating a link between vascular abnormality and neuronal changes. In addition, AR deficiency provides protection in retinal neurons possibly by modulating glial responses and reducing oxidative stress, suggesting a therapeutic potential of AR inhibition in the treatment of ROP with beneficial effects on retinal neurons...|$|R
