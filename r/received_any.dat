Also, Josephine Bracken, Jose Rizal's fiancée, sought refuge in their house when the Spanish authorities threatened to torture her.|$|E

5|$|According to Plutarch, an army under Parmenion {{defeated}} the Illyrian king Grabos in 356 BC, {{shortly after the}} conclusion of the siege of Potidea. Grabos then became a subject ally of Macedon. The following year, Philip seems to have defeated Ketriporis, and reduced him to the status of a subject ally, although information for this campaign is very limited. He is also presumed to have {{defeated the}} Paionians at some point during this period, although there is no explicit record of this. There is no evidence that any of these allies <b>received</b> <b>any</b> substantial aid from Athens, which was still too preoccupied with the Social War.|$|E
5|$|As {{the case}} {{expanded}} beyond his jurisdiction, Curto recused {{himself from the}} trial {{and was replaced by}} Javier Beltramone, who released García from prison. Litoral Gas demanded Beltramone's recusal for expressing an opinion about the case to the press. The appeal court agreed in a 2–1 vote to remove Beltramone, and the case was transferred to Patricia Bilotta. García had claimed that he was following instructions received {{in the days before the}} explosion, so Bilotta summoned the technical officers of Litoral Gas to clarify that point. Litoral Gas said that García had not <b>received</b> <b>any</b> instructions prior to the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the above}} {{mentioned}} awards and unanimous critical approval, The Wire {{never won a}} single Primetime Emmy Award nor <b>received</b> <b>any</b> major nominations, except for two writing nominations in 2005 and 2008. Several critics recognized its lack of recognition by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. According {{to a report by}} Variety, anonymous Emmy voters cited reasons such as the series' dense and multilayered plot, the grim subject matter, and the series' lack of connection with California, as it is set and filmed in Baltimore.|$|E

5|$|He {{attended}} the University of Virginia, {{where he played}} basketball and baseball; {{he was a member}} of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity. His brother Bill also played baseball for Virginia. During the off-season, umpire Cy Rigler worked as an assistant coach for the University. He recognized Rixey's talent and tried to sign him to the Philadelphia Phillies. Rixey originally declined, saying he wanted to be a chemist, but Rigler insisted, even offering a substantial portion of the bonus he received for signing a player. With his family in financial trouble, Rixey accepted the deal. The National League, upon hearing of the deal, created a rule that prohibits umpires from signing players. Neither Rixey nor Rigler <b>received</b> <b>any</b> signing bonus.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Stroud {{advertised in}} a {{publication}} {{that he had}} not <b>received</b> <b>any</b> royalties from the sales of Diseases of Canaries. In retaliation, the publisher complained to the warden, and, as a result, proceedings were initiated to transfer Stroud to Alcatraz, where he would not be permitted to keep his birds. In the end, however, Stroud was able to keep both his birds and canary-selling business at Leavenworth. Stroud avoided trouble for several more years, until it came to light that some of the equipment Stroud had requested for his lab was in fact being used as a home-made still to distill alcohol. Officials finally had the wedge they needed to drive Stroud out.|$|E

Critics of USAF's safety record stated that this crash was an example of a pattern of problems related to enforcement of safety procedures within USAF.|$|E

5|$|The tournament {{began on}} the episode aired November 9, 2009, and playing in order from the lowest to the highest seed, tournament contestants played {{one at a time}} {{at the end of that}} episode and the next nine. The rules were exactly the same as they were for a normal million dollar {{question}} under the clock format introduced the season before, except here, the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal. Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds. For each question they had answered before walking away, the contestants <b>received</b> <b>any</b> unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers. The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final question time limit.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} details are unknown, in April738 K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat {{captured}} Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil and burned two of Copán's patron deities. Six days later Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was decapitated in Quiriguá. This coup {{does not seem}} to have physically affected either Copán or Quiriguá; there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have <b>received</b> <b>any</b> detectable tribute. All of this seems to imply that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed to somehow ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, rather than to have defeated him in outright battle. It has been suggested that Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was attempting to attack another site to secure captives for sacrifice in order to dedicate the new ballcourt when he was ambushed by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quiriguá warriors.|$|E
