40|$|Despite {{the high}} cost of memory and CPU time {{required}} to resolve the boundary layer, a viscous unstructured grid solver has many advantages over a structured grid solver such as the convenience in automated grid generation and shock or vortex capturing by solution adaption. Since the geometry and flow phenomenon of a helicopter are very complex, unstructured grid-based methods are well-suited to model properly the <b>rotor-fuselage</b> <b>interaction</b> than the structured grid solver. In present study, an unstructured Cartesian grid solver is developed {{on the basis of the}} existing solver, NASCART-GT. Instead of cut-cell approach, immersed boundary approach is applied with ghost cell boundary condition, which increases the accuracy and minimizes unphysical fluctuations of the flow properties. The standard k-epsilon model by Launder and Spalding is employed for the turbulence modeling, and a new wall function approach is devised for the unstructured Cartesian grid solver. It is quite challenging and has never done before to apply wall function approach to immersed Cartesian grid. The difficulty lies in the inability to acquire smooth variation of y+ in the desired range due to the non-body-fitted cells near the solid wall. The wall function boundary condition developed in this work yields stable and reasonable solution within the accuracy of the turbulence model. The grid efficiency is also improved with respect to the conventional method. The turbulence modeling is validated and the efficiency of the developed boundary condition is tested in 2 -D flow field around a flat plate, NACA 0012 airfoil, axisymmetric hemispheroid, and rotorcraft applications. For rotor modeling, an actuator disk model is chosen, since it is efficient and is widely verified in the study of the <b>rotor-fuselage</b> <b>interaction.</b> This model considers the rotor as an infinitely thin disk, which carries pressure jump across the disk and allows flow to pass through it. The full three dimensional calculations of Euler and RANS equations are performed for the GT rotor model and ROBIN configuration to test implemented actuator disk model along with the developed turbulence modeling. Finally, the characteristics of the <b>rotor-fuselage</b> <b>interaction</b> are investigated by comparing the numerical solutions with the experiments. Ph. D.

40|$|Abstract] A {{method of}} {{unstructured}} dynamic overset grids is {{developed for the}} simulation of rotor forward flight flow and unsteady <b>rotor-fuselage</b> <b>interaction</b> aerodynamics. Two overset grids are formed by dividing the initial integral grid into two parts, namely, rotational grid and static grid, and the rotational grid rotates with the rotor while the static grid keep static during the calculating process. Also the hole fringes are formed and donor elements for hole fringe points are founded {{at the same time}} when the overset grids are formed. An appropriate overlapped area can be ensured during the unsteady calculation process, and the hole fringe needn’t to be formed repeatedly in this method. A fast searching method is used to update the donor elements, which can reduce the computational effort. The linear spring analogy is used in the rotational grid to calculate the flapping and pitching movement. The unsteady Euler equations are solved using duel time stepping to simulate a two-bladed rotor forward flight flow and Georgia Tech configuration <b>rotor-fuselage</b> <b>interaction</b> flowfield and the calculation results agree well with Experimental data.

The code uses patched grids that move relative {{to each other}} to simulate {{the motion of the}} rotor airfoils with respect to the stator airfoils.

The pressure contours obtained are almost oscillation free because of the TVD nature of the scheme. A new procedure was developed to simulate flows about bodies that move relative to each other.

However, regardless of its significance this problem is not well-studied and few CFD works have so far been published. In this paper, a method is put forward to allow CFD computations of rotor-fuselage problems using a sliding mesh to interface the rotor and fuselage regions. A sliding plane forms a boundary between a CFD mesh around the fuselage and a rotor-fixed CFD mesh which has to be rotated to account for the motion of the rotor blades. CFD meshes adjacent to a sliding plane do not necessarily have matching nodes or even the same number of cell-faces.

A notional X 2 TD coaxial compound configuration has been chosen to perform numerical simulations in forward flight with CFD-CSD coupling.

40|$|The {{effective}} and efficient evaluation of conceptual product designs prior to manufacturing of prototypes, is of utmost importance for any industrial ac¬tivity. The rotorcraft industry is no different. Accurate, thorough and cost-effective evaluation of conceptual rotorcraft designs requires an equivalently rigorous and simultaneously affordable methodology covering all aspects rel¬ative. The associated issues to be tackled are indeed multi-dimensional and include trim performance, rotor blade structural loads prediction, engine per¬formance, mission analysis and associated environmental impact. The aforementioned topics are now raising even more interest as rotorcraft traffic {{is expected to grow}} sharply within the next 20 years. Current rotorcraft operations imply the consumption of the equivalent of 400, 000 tons of aviation fuel per year, only with regards to the European region. Maintaining current rotorcraft technologies is expected to lead to a quadruplicating of this figure. This {{is a direct result of}} the expected traffic augmentation. In recognition of this trend, a wide range of research & development activities is currently being undertaken at national and European levels. The objective is to effectively return within 20 years to the present global level of environmental impact, while sustaining the expected growth of rotorcraft services. The objective set above is indeed an ambitious one. Due to the rather short time-scales involved, its realization requires for focus to be placed predomi¬nantly on the design of operational procedures. It is however realized that, in order to manage the environmental impact of civil rotorcraft aviation within larger time-scales, options concerning the design of conceptual configurations as well as incorporated operational procedures, need to be explored. Two fundamental requirements are therefore identified and addressed within this work. The 1 st lies with regards to a generic methodology capable of design¬ing optimum operational procedures in terms of fuel burn, gaseous emissions and ground noise impact. The 2 nd can be designated as a design assessment approach, capable of estimating the overall fuel consumption with regards to any designated operation. The employed method has to be capable of being utilized within the task of design while simultaneously maintaining a reasonable computational overhead so as to be applicable in the context of multidisciplinary optimization. This work elaborates on the development and application of an integrated approach, targeting the comprehensive assessment of combined helicopter– engine designs, within complete, three-dimensional operations. A series of individual modeling methods has been developed, each applicable to a dif-ferent aspect of helicopter flight dynamics and performance. These comprise rotor blade modal analysis, aeroelasticity, flight dynamics trim solution, en-gine performance and three-dimensional flight path definition. The individual mathematical models are elaborately integrated within a numerical procedure solving for the total mission fuel consumption. Extensive validation with ex-isting experimental and numerical data has been waged during each step of the development process. The aspect of multidisciplinary design of optimum rotorcraft operations in terms of fuel burn and environmental impact is also tackled within the con-text of this work. An existing integrated tool capable of estimating the per-formance and emitted noise of any defined rotorcraft configuration within any designated mission has been incorporated. A comprehensive and cost-effective optimization strategy has been structured. The methodology has been applied to two generic – baseline missions representative of current rotorcraft opera¬tions. Missions optimally designed in a multidisciplinary manner for fuel burn, gaseous emissions and ground noise impact have been obtained. The contribution to knowledge arising from the successful completion of this work, broadly comprises the development of methodologies applicable to the following aspects of civil rotorcraft aviation: (i) Comprehensive analysis of the overall flight dynamics and performance of any designated helicopter–engine integrated system, within realistically defined three-dimensional missions; (ii) Multidisciplinary design of optimum rotorcraft operations in terms of fuel consumption, gaseous and ground noise impact; Further to the above, con-tribution has been made through the analytical development of modeling ap-proaches with application to: (i) Rotor blade modal analysis; (ii) Treatment of rotor blade flexibility; (iii) <b>Rotor–fuselage</b> aerodynamic <b>interaction.</b> The developed analytical methods have been utilized within this work to facilitate the achievement of the set objectives.

40|$|The {{resolution}} of the complex physics of rotating configurations is critical for any engineering analysis that requires multiple frames of reference. Two well-known applications are in the rotorcraft and wind energy industries. Rotor wake impingement from rotor-fuselage and wind turbine-tower interactions impact structural and acoustic characteristics. Additionally, parasite drag resulting from rotorcraft hubs may result in severe limitations on forward flight vehicle performance. Complex turbulent wakes from rotors and hubs impinging on downstream empennage can create adverse aeroelastic behavior and can affect handling qualities. Numerical simulations of these flows require state-of-the-art Navier Stokes methods using dynamic overset grids. However, many current methods typically used in industry result in wakes that dissipate essential features. In order to address these concerns, two advancements are introduced in this thesis. Feature-based grid adaptation on dynamic overset grids has been developed and demonstrated with an unstructured Navier Stokes solver. The unique feature of the adaptation technique {{is that it is}} applied globally on the overset grid system except within the boundary layer. In concert with grid adaptation, an efficient parallelized search algorithm for solution interpolation over massively distributed systems has been created. This results in cost-effective interpolation that retains the numerical order of accuracy and has been verified in both space and time. The improvements have been demonstrated for <b>rotor-fuselage</b> <b>interaction</b> and a generic rotating hub.

Furthermore, they would help in the process of identifying design solutions aimed to the reduction of interior noise, that is a crucial aspect for the widely-requested passenger comfort enhancement. In this paper, the capabilities of the ROTAERO simulation tool, developed at the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering of the University of Rome "La Sapienza," to predict both the trim conditions and the vibration levels, characterizing a flying helicopter, are explored. A general modular solution algorithm is developed for the trim analysis of helicopters, in order to evaluate the stationary solution of equilibrium equations for rotorcraft, and for the vibratory loads. These last characteristics are evaluated {{with the aid of a}} finite element model of the fuselage forced by vibratory hub loads, that are predicted through the aeroelastic analysis of the main rotor treated as isolated.
