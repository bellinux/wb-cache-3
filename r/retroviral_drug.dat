40|$|AbstractEnzymatic deamination of cytidines in DNA is an {{intrinsic}} component of antibody maturation and retroviral resistance, {{but can also}} be a source of HIV drug resistance and cancer-causing mutations. Here, we developed a high-throughput method based on high resolution melt (HRM) analysis called HyperHRM that can screen genomic DNA for rare hypermutated proviral sequences and accurately quantify the number of C-to-T or G-to-A mutations in each sequence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by profiling in parallel the intensity of the DNA mutator activity of all seven human APOBEC 3 proteins on the near full-length sequence of HIV- 1 and the Moloney murine leukemia virus. Additionally, HRM was successfully used to identify hypermutated proviral sequences in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from an HIV- 1 patient.

40|$|Abstract: The {{management}} of HIV infection has posed significant problems. Management {{of patients with}} HIV infections has improved with {{the availability of a}} series of <b>retroviral</b> <b>drugs.</b> The cost of therapy is exorbitant, especially in the Indian context. Within a few years of their use, the medical fraternity has started encountering people with drug resistant viruses. This development of resistance is due to patient related factors like poor absorption of drugs, drug-drug interaction and nonadherence to treatment. The situation is confounded because of the improper use of these drugs by the doctors by not using adequate dosages and poor selection of the primary line of therapy. It is important that the primary therapy which is chosen by the doctor is most effective in suppressing the viral load and bring it below 50 copies/ml and should be effective in maintaining this level of suppression of viral load over many years. The corner stone of beating the drug resistance is to choose the therapy regime effectively and consciously and educate the patient about the regular usage of medicine and adequate dosages. The other modalities and combination of drugs used in patients who tend to develop resistance are discussed in detail in this Chapter...|$|R
40|$|HIV {{continues}} to infect at pandemic levels despite the {{significant progress in}} research, treatment and prevention. Advances in anti-HIV <b>retroviral</b> <b>drugs</b> have led to significant reduction in AIDS-related deaths, delayed the progression of the HIV infection to AIDS and diminished the rates of HIV transmission. However, the current antiretroviral treatment frequently encounters drug-resistant viruses due to the high mutation rate of HIV proteins. Therefore, identification of cellular cofactors of HIV infection is critical to identify new targets for anti-HIV drug development. However, the genetic complexity of mammalian cells imposes additional obstacles to the identification of HIV- 1 cellular cofactors. To mitigate {{the effects of the}} complex mammalian genomes, we propose to use Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) as a model to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the early events of HIV- 1 infection. Drosophila is a powerful model organism due to its well-characterized genetics, and the availability of the entire genomic sequence and vast database.

40|$|Background: Beside {{various factors}} for {{producing}} diabetes, {{it seems that}} chronic hepatitis C, HIV/HCV co-infection, and anti-retroviral treatment especially including protease inhibitors may predispose to diabetes. This study conducted to determine prevalence of diabetes in HIV and HCV patients. Methods: The registries of 150 HCV patients, 50 HIV patients and 90 HIV/HCV co-infected patients in Hepatic Clinics and consulting center for behavioral disorders in Kermanshah Western Iran was studied. The patients selected using convenience sampling method. Variables including age, sex, duration of disease, injecting drug usage, liver enzymes level, CD 4 count, treatment with anti retroviral, treatment with interferon and blood sugar level were collected. Subjects with FBS≥ 126 or BS≥ 200 mg/dl described as diabetic. Data analyzed using chi-square and Fisher tests and SPSS software. Results: The prevalence of diabetes was 2. 7 %, 4 % and 2. 2 % among patients infected with HCV, HIV and HIV/HCV co infection respectively. None of the variables such as age, sex, liver enzymes, injecting drug usage, CD 4 count, antiretroviral treatment and interferon determined as risk factors for diabetes.

Aim: This study was to assess {{the quality of life of}} PLWHA participating in five support groups in Southern Cross River Senatorial District. Methods: The study was a descriptive survey. It was delimited to PLWHA who belonged to support groups and were available to complete the questionnaire. A total of 123 PLWHA were recruited into the study. WHOQOL BREF was used for data collection. Results: The mean (SD) age of the PLWHA was 36. 4 +/- 10. 9. Most 83 (67. 5 %) were females while 40 (32. 5 %) were males (Figure 1). With regards to education, most of the respondents 60 (48. 8 %) attended secondary school, followed by 48 (39 %) who attended tertiary institutions while only 15 (12. 2 %) had primary education (Figure 2). The highest mean (SD) quality of life score emanated from physical health, 14. 04 + 2. 66.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2007. Since HIV/AIDS {{is closely}} {{connected}} with adult sexuality, children in early schooling are often overlooked in debates around the pandemic. However {{the growing number}} of children who are infected or affected by HIV/AIDS cannot be ignored. This qualitative study gives voice to young childrens' experiences and understanding of HIV/AIDS in Savannah Park, province of KwaZulu-Natal. The study also explores how HIV/AIDS intersects with other barriers to learning and development and the effect this has upon childrens' lives. Twenty learners between the ages of 8 - 9 years who come from low income families were selected as participants in this study. They were interviewed using focus group interviews. During the focus group interviews, various participatory research techniques such as drawing, story telling, projection, games and movement evaluation exercises were employed. One of the key findings that emerged was that the participants consistently identified HIV/AIDS as a deadly disease. There was also a deep sense of fear amongst participants that their family members will contract HIV/AIDS rendering them vulnerable to the devastating impacts of the disease. Another important finding was that many participants were able to correctly identify symptoms of the disease revealing intimate knowledge and personal experience of the disease. Some modes of transmission of HIV/AIDS were also particularly well known amongst participants such as touching blood and sharing infected needles. This study however highlights the need for children in early schooling to be given accurate information on the sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS. Participants were also restricted in their knowledge of preventative measures against the HIV/AIDS virus and did not have any specific knowledge of anti <b>retroviral</b> <b>drugs.</b> Another key finding was the high levels of awareness amongst participants of the challenges experienced by HIV/AIDS infected and affected children. Lack of money, food, clothing and support coupled with sickness and high rates of absenteeism within a HIV/AIDS context impeded learning from their perspective. The views participants express also reveal that HIV/AIDS affected and infected children are still subject to prejudice, isolation and stigmatization within educational settings. However there is hope in that many participants expressed warmth and friendship towards HIV/AIDS infected children. Support structures such as family members, neighbours, teachers, social workers, church and medical personnel were also regarded as having a positive effect on the lives of HIV/AIDS affected and infected children...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Acute {{kidney failure}} (acute kidney injury, AKI) {{is a group}} of syndromes that result in a decline in the glomerular {{filtration}} rate. In 2002, the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) group proposed the RIFLE criteria to standardize the definitions of AKI severity and outcome. This criterion has been validated in several studies. AKI is frequently encountered in hospitalized patients; it has a negative impact on mortality and morbidity. A lot of work has been done to describe the epidemiology of AKI in developed countries. The same does not apply for developing countries. This study was designed to evaluate AKI in a tertiary care hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. Objectives: This study was designed to determine the period prevalence of acute renal failure in all patients admitted to the hospital during the study period, to determine the severity of acute renal failure in these patients based on the RIFLE criteria and to elucidate the associated risk factors leading to renal failure in the patients. We also described the modalities used to manage the patients as well as their outcome at the time they were leaving hospital Method: We carried out a prospective cross sectional study to determine the epidemiology of acute kidney injury in a tertiary care hospital in Kenya. All patients over the age of 12 years admitted to the hospital were followed up prospectively and those diagnosed to have AKI at any time during their stay in hospital were assessed for risk factors, mode of management and outcome. Results: A total of 102 patients were enrolled during the study period running from 1 st April 2007 to 31 st December 2007. The period prevalence was found to be 1050 per 100000. Other studies have found a prevalence ranging from 400 to 5700 per 100000. Higher values were found in the critical care areas. Seventy one (69. 9 %) of the patients were male, 81 (80 %) were African and {{the mean age of the}} cohort was 50. 1 years. We found that 41 (40 %) of the patients were in the failure category while risk and injury constituted 27 (26 %) and 34 (34 %) respectively. The commonest risk factor was drug use especially angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (23. 81 %), non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (14. 29 %), anti <b>retroviral</b> <b>drugs</b> (19. 05 % and diuretics (9. 52 %). Other commonly associated findings included a history of vomiting, diarrhea and seizures. The most common underlying diagnoses were sepsis (50 %), diabetes mellitus (34. 31), malignancies (25. 49 %), surgical (24. 49 %) and pulmonary diseases (22. 5 %). Only 32 (31. 37 %) of all patients were reviewed by a nephrologist. Majority of the patients, 88 (86. 2 %) were managed conservatively. The rest were put on hemodialysis. Fifty (49 %) patients had full recovery, 34 (33. 3 %) had partial recovery while 1 (0. 98 %) had persistent loss. Sixteen (15. 68 %) of the patients with acute kidney injury died during the index hospital admission. Conclusion: AKI is common in our environment. Similar finding are noted in developed countries. Most of our patients are younger than those seen in the developed countries. Mortality in patients with AKI is high...|$|R

Nine years ago, we transplanted two dogs (E 900 and E 958) with autologous marrow CD 34 + cells that had been transduced with a gammaretrovirus vector encoding a conditionally activatable derivative of the thrombopoietin receptor. Receptor activation through administration of a chemical inducer of dimerization (CID) (AP 20187 or AP 1903) confers a growth advantage.

40|$|Major {{limitations}} to gene therapy using HSCs are low gene transfer efficiency {{and the inability}} of most therapeutic genes to confer a selective advantage on the gene-corrected cells. One approach to enrich for gene-modified cells in vivo is {{to include in the}} <b>retroviral</b> vector a <b>drug</b> resistance gene, such as the P 140 K mutant of the DNA repair enzyme O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT*). We transplanted 5 rhesus macaques with CD 34 + cells transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding MGMT* and a fluorescent marker, with or without homeobox B 4 (HOXB 4), a potent stem cell self-renewal gene. Transgene expression and common integration sites in lymphoid and myeloid lineages several months after transplantation confirmed transduction of long-term repopulating HSCs. However, all animals showed only a transient increase in gene-marked lymphoid and myeloid cells after O 6 -benzylguanine (BG) and temozolomide (TMZ) administration. In 1 animal, cells transduced with MGMT* lentiviral vectors were protected and expanded after multiple courses of BG/TMZ, providing a substantial increase in the maximum tolerated dose of TMZ. Additional cycles of chemotherapy using 1, 3 -bis-(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea (BCNU) resulted in similar increases in gene marking levels, but caused high levels of nonhematopoietic toxicity. Inclusion of HOXB 4 in the MGMT* vectors resulted in no substantial increase in gene marking or HSC amplification after chemotherapy treatment. Our data therefore suggest that lentivirally mediated gene transfer in transplanted HSCs can provide in vivo chemoprotection of progenitor cells, although selection of long-term repopulating HSCs was not seen...|$|R

The spike is made as a trimeric transmembrane protein in the infected cell and incorporated into virus by budding at the cell surface. The spike then guides the virus to an uninfected cell for virus entry by membrane fusion. These tasks put several demands on the spike function. A key event is its binding to a receptor molecule of the target cell. This triggers, or activates the spike for membrane fusion. However, the activation should not occur in the cell where the virus is produced. Therefore, premature activation is prevented by synthesis of the spike in a precursor form, unable to fuse. Proteolytic cleavage of the spike, before receptor binding, then creates a mature form of the spike, which can be activated by the receptor. I have studied the maturation process of the Moloney (Mo) -MLV spike. The Mo-MLV spike precursor matures by two proteolytic cleavages. The first one is by the furin enzyme of the producer cell and this forms the receptor binding peripheral subunit (SU) and the fusion active transmembrane subunit (TM) of the spike. The second cleavage is made by the viral protease and occurs in newly released virus. It separates a short peptide, called the Rpeptide, from the membrane internal cytoplasmic tail (CT) of TM. I have studied the R-peptide cleavage using biochemical techniques and found that the cleavages in the trimeric spike occur by positive cooperativity, i. e. the cleavage of one subunit facilitates the cleavages of the two other TM subunits in the spike. This helps the spike to reach full fusion activity soon after virus budding. The activation of the spike by the receptor involves dissociation of SU from TM so that the latter can fuse the viral and the cell membranes. I also found that the R-peptide interfered with this dissociation step by inhibiting isomerization of the intersubunit disulfide in the Mo-MLV spike, which normally occurs soon after receptor binding. Using HIV- 1 I studied how the primary receptor CD 4 activated the spike for binding to the coreceptor, a chemokinreceptor. In this case I used cryo-electron microscopy and image processing to determine the 3 D structures of the native unliganded and the CD 4 bound spike. The spikes were released from virus, with or without bound CD 4, by solubilization with TX- 100 and isolated for EM analysis by density gradient centrifugation. I found that the native spike had an open cage-like structure, where the protomeric unit formed a common roof and a lobe, and a leg on the side. This structure was verified by the unique fitting of the earlier determined atomic structure of the core portion of the peripheral subunit. CD 4 binding caused the roof part to lift up probably to enable coreceptor binding and to open the roof for the fusion activated TM...|$|R
