25|$|LittleBigPlanets origin {{lies in a}} {{conversation}} between Media Molecule co-founders Mark Healey and Dave Smith after a cinema visit to see Howl's Moving Castle. Healey and Smith discussed a game that had character controls similar to their previous game, <b>Rag</b> <b>Doll</b> Kung Fu, that would be playable on a console. Healey and Smith left Lionhead Studios in December 2005 along with other Media Molecule co-founders Alex Evans and art director Kareem Ettouney, and managed to arrange a meeting with Phil Harrison, the then-head of development for SCE Worldwide Studios. They created a prototype of their idea, a game called Craftworld, a physics-based, 2D side-scrolling game, with a place holder character called Mr. Yellowhead. Mr. Yellowhead's arms were controllable with the right analogue stick of the PlayStation 2 controller that Media Molecule had connected to their PC, whilst his legs were controlled with the left stick. The object of the game was to guide Mr. Yellowhead past a number of obstacles by grabbing onto objects and pushing or rolling them around.|$|E

5000|$|Ana Karen Allende is a Mexican artisan {{from the}} Mexico City borough of Coyoacán, {{who specializes in}} {{creating}} <b>rag</b> <b>dolls</b> and soft fabric animals.

Allende’s first doll was made when her sister {{was about to turn}} fifteen. For quinceañera celebrations in Xochimilco, it is customary to give the girl her “last doll” as a means of marking her transition from child to adult. Allende decided to make this doll herself, using sewing skills taught to her by her grandmother. Soon after, she began to make dolls for her friends and family, and the attention they received prompted her to think of selling them.|$|R

500|$|The Feminist Improvising Group (FIG) {{was founded}} in London in 1977 by Scottish vocalist Maggie Nicols from Centipede and English bassoonist/composer Lindsay Cooper from Henry Cow.

[...] While Nicols and Cooper had both performed frequently with men, they had little experience performing with other women, but their involvement in class politics as well as feminist and lesbian activism prompted them to pursue this project. The other members of the five-piece ensemble were cellist/bassist Georgie Born, also from Henry Cow, vocalist/pianist Cathy Williams from the British duo <b>Rag</b> <b>Doll,</b> and trumpeter Corinne Liensol from British feminist rock band Jam Today.

Although Amealco is strongly connected to these dolls, their making is not limited and has spread into various states, with some variations in dress and appearance, but always keeping with wide faces and hair generously braided with ribbons.|$|R
