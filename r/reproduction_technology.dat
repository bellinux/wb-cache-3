Male infertility caused by absence of the vas deferens may be overcome with testicular sperm extraction, collecting sperm cells directly from the testicles. If the collected sample contains too few sperm cells to likely have a spontaneous fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection can be performed. Third party reproduction is also a possibility for women with CF. Whether taking antioxidants affects outcomes is unclear.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: India is fast {{becoming}} the most prominent player in the global industry of reproductive tourism, in which infertile people cross international borders to seek assisted <b>reproduction</b> <b>technologies.</b> This {{study was conducted to}} better understand the extent and manner in which Indian clinics seek foreign clients. Methods: A systematic search of official Indian assisted <b>reproduction</b> <b>technologies</b> clinic Websites was undertaken, and instances noted where foreign clients were overtly targeted, and where maternal surrogacy was overtly offered. Results: A total of 159 clinics with Web addresses were identified, though only 78 had functioning Websites. All were published in English, with the majority clustered in the states of Maharashtra (14) and Gujarat (9). Of the 78 functioning Websites, 53 (68 %) featured some mention of maternal surrogacy services, and 42 (54 %) made overt overtures to foreign clients. Qualitative appeals to foreigners included instructions for international adoption, visa application, and the legal parental disposition of the surrogate. All Maharashtran clinic Websites that mentioned surrogacy also overtly featured reproductive tourism. Preimplantation diagnosis services were not offered disproportionately by clinics mentioning reproductive tourism. Conclusions: Based upon clinic online profiles, reproductive tourism comprises a substantial fraction of India’s assisted <b>reproduction</b> <b>technologies</b> clinics’ business focus, clustering around its most tourist-friendly locales, and surrogacy may be a strong motivator for international clientele...|$|R

40|$|Drawing on ethnographic {{research}} on Muslim devotional practices in Mauritius, this chapter investigates material aspects of discourse circulation in religious settings, above all vocalization and transduction. I {{pay attention to}} the role Mauritian Muslims ascribe to sound <b>reproduction</b> <b>technologies</b> in safeguarding what they regard as the authentic replication of devotional poetry performances in ritual settings. In the particular context at hand, a certain aspect of the materiality of language, the qualities of vocalization, helps to minimize the gap between authoritative source and present performance. This process unfolds through transduction, which generates the sonic presence of the reciting voice in another setting through sound reproduction. The sonic presence thus generated becomes the occasion for beliefs on technology according to which the latter is able to faithfully “store” linguistic signs with their full spectrum of material qualities. In treating sound <b>reproduction</b> <b>technologies</b> accordingly, their users are guided by the assumption that sound reproduction, if working properly, is a medium that erases its own traces, despite the complex sequence of transductions it actually entails...|$|R
