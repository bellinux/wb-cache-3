However, traditional visual inspection to monitor the concrete cracks has disadvantages such as subjective inspection nature, associated time and cost, and possible danger to inspectors. To alter the visual inspection, a complete procedure for automated crack assessment based on adaptive digital image processing has been proposed in this study. Crack objects are extracted from the images using the subtraction with median filter and the local binarization using the Niblack's method. To adaptively determine the optimal window sizes for the median filter and the Niblack's method without distortion of crack object, an optimal filter size index (OFSI) is proposed. From the extracted crack objects using the optimal size of window, the crack objects are decomposed to the crack skeletons and edges, and the crack width is calculated using 4 -connected normal line according to {{the orientation of the}} local skeleton line.

40|$|In {{innovative}} reactor {{concepts of}} generation III and III+, passive safety systems are applied {{in order to}} ensure the integrity of the physical barriers against the release of fission products to the environment in the course of accidents. The containment represents the final barrier. An early filtered release due to an unacceptable pressure increase therefore has to be excluded or at least delayed. For this purpose, building condensers are envisaged in modern containment concepts in order to condense the steam released during an accident and thus reduce pressure. Experimental investigations on this concept conducted at various facilities showed a significant trip of the condenser effectivity in case of beyond-design-basis accidents with hydrogen release into the containment. In order to reduce the related significant pressure rise, an innovative condenser concept with integrated catalyst elements for recombining the hydrogen with the atmospheric oxygen present is proposed and investigated. The CFD (computational fluid dynamics) models developed in the present work form the basis for numerical simulation of the complex interaction between catalytic <b>reaction,</b> <b>wall</b> condensation and buoyancy-driven flow inside an innovative, combined catalyst-condenser bundle.

40|$|The European Laboratory for Structural Assessment {{is able to}} test large {{structures}} on its <b>reaction</b> <b>wall</b> and strong floor. Conventional sensors are used to collect displacement, elongation and strain on particular points of the structures, but they are punctual, or integrate the information along lines. Furthermore, a typical experiment in ELSA involves huge forces applied to the structure, an action in antinomy with a perfect control of the boundary conditions. Beyond {{the fact that it}} permits to have field of observations, photogrammetry allows quick and accurate diagnostic of the setting of experiments, and characterisation of their boundary conditions. Thus, photogrammetry has been introduced in the laboratory complementarily to the traditional techniques. In some case, the structure is driven to a brittle ruin, which could possibly lead to the loss of costly sensors or camera. The study presented here is a first step to evaluate photogrammetry based on low-cost digital consumer camera. On the long term, it could permit {{to increase the number of}} low-cost camera while keeping information at a fair level. The experimental setting was composed of a cylindrical shell (length 6. 7 m, diameter 55 cm) of composite material anchored on the <b>reaction</b> <b>wall</b> and progressively bent by applying a torque at its free extremity. The zone under scrutiny was a joint linking two cylindrical subassemblies of the structure. A net of 13 x 9 targets (squares of side 22 mm) was disposed on the carbon fibre joint with a mesh step of approximately 35 mm. The cameras were two webcams Philips ToUcam Pro with CCD sensor of 640 x 480 pixels on 8 bits. The stereo set-up was calibrated with the method of Bouguet. The targets were identified through morphological image analysis. Their temporal positions on series of 57 images pairs- were measured by fitting ellipse to their internal circle and the 3 dimensional positions of the targets were obtained through usual geometric construction, correcting for distortion of the optics. The mean radius of the joint was found to be 556. 91 mm, in a zone where the joint-radius varies from 550 to 560 mm. At small deflections of the cylinder, we have compared the deflection normalised by the distance to the anchoring. The optical measurements are within 6 % of the reference value given by the deflection sensor positioned on the diametrically opposed side of the target network. The elongation was also measured between targets in line with the cylinder axis, and compared with the sensor disposed in the field of view. The reference elongation curve of extent 0 to 0. 25 mm- was framed by the optical measurements, which had a noise of 0. 02 mm. The first results obtained with low-cost digital consumer camera appears promising, although a more sophisticated matching and following process is needed in order to clearly asses their use. Further studies are underway to match the texture of the zone in between the targets mesh, in order to increase the density of measuring points, and get better comparison with local strain gauges that are present in the target network.

During the test, displacements were measured by means of linear variable differential transducers (LVDTs), while strains of reinforcement were measured by means of strain gauges. The location of strain gauges can be found in Fig.  8. The axial load was first applied to the target value and maintained constant by adjusting the readings of instrument panel in the hydraulic jack during the experiment. In the tests, a force-control loading program was applied before the longitudinal reinforcement yielded. The increment of load was initially 50  kN for each step until arriving at 80 % of the predicted yielding load, and then changed the increment of 50  kN into 25  kN. The force-control loading procedure was not changed until the longitudinal reinforcement yielded. Then, the specimens were subjected to the cyclic shear force by the displacement-control loading method with the increment of each load step equals to the measured yield displacement up until the shear-resisting capacity drops by more than 20 % of the maximum shear force.

40|$|Experimental {{methods and}} their {{innovative}} applications to earthquake engineering are an invaluable and irreplaceable tool to throw light onto {{a number of}} complex matters related to the behaviour of structural systems under seismic excitation. It is commonly acknowledged {{that the development of}} code formulations for the design or assessment of earthquake resistant structures and the assessment and validation of said approaches could not have been achieved but through extensive experimental activity. For this reason, in the last decades, very considerable research efforts and economic resources have been allocated, in Europe and worldwide, to the development of increasingly accurate and state-of-the-art facilities and testing methods and algorithms, {{to the point of being}} virtually able of experimentally reproducing and studying any structural problem, in many cases removing limitations previously deemed inherent to experiments, due to the incredibly fast-paced growth of computational capacities. Nevertheless, for accurate, grand, expensive and extensive as an experimental campaign can be, for long-standing and active a facility or laboratory can be, there will always be aspects of challenge, novelty, peculiarity inherent in any new experimental campaign, requiring tailoring ad-hoc procedures, solutions, in some cases ¿expedients¿ to fully and correctly study the problem at hand.

40|$|Seismic {{assessment}} of reinforced concrete structures {{as well as}} their rehabilitation and strengthening is dealt with in many experimental and theoretical researches. New trends in seismic assessment essentially refer to “performance based design”. Experimental research both on seismic {{assessment of}} existing elements {{as well as on the}} efficiency of different retrofitting techniques is essential. Much research is currently being directed towards retrofitting solutions for existing reinforced concrete structures under seismic load. Among these, fibre-reinforced polymer (frp) confinement of elements stressed under axial and/or bending action is an increasingly popular solution, with a similar trend in research effort. Confining concrete can in fact significantly enhance both its resistance and stiffness properties; the exterior frp jacket, besides, protects the inner core from temperature and humidity effects, adding to its durability. This paper focuses on current experimental tests at the Laboratory of experiments on materials and structures of the University of Roma Tre on eight 1 : 6 scaled column specimens representative of tall and squat 2, 500 m diameter circular r. c. piers of regular (14 - 21 - 14 m tall) and irregular bridges (14 - 7 - 21 m tall) designed according to EC 8 and Italian Code before 1986. In previous research some columns were tested until collapse by pseudodynamic tests but others are still entire. An accurate study to detect the level of degradation in materials, as the case of real structures after an earthquake, is now performed. Piers designed according to Italian Code show dearth in transverse reinforcement resulting in concrete core crushing in compression and longitudinal bar buckling and rupture. Concrete cover spalling and yielding of hoops are clearly visible at pier base over a height of about 200 - 300 mm. Squat piers are also affected by shear cracking which spread with an about 52 °- 56 ° inclination angle. EC 8 pier damage is restricted to concrete cover spalling and longitudinal bar buckling due to localized hoop arrangement. Based on the evaluation done, EC 8 columns are repaired and Italian ones retrofitted by mean of FRP jacket with the aim of enhancing ductility and shear capacity. Repairing operations are described in detail. Mechanical removal of damaged concrete cover followed by cleaning of substrate from residue particles is performed to provide a good bond. Concrete core is repaired with resin injections. Two different restoring operations are forseen for damaged longitudinal reinforcing bars: cutting of the damaged portion of the bars and restoration with welded stainless bars on one hand, setting of 1 m length stainless bars anchored in foundation to support existing bars on the other hand. New bars are applied in pairs to avoid asymmetries. Casting self compacting concrete is used to restore damaged pier section. Its low shrinkage, elastic modulus not higher than the one of the substrate and high tensile strength allow to reduce tensile stresses in the material. In addition, good workability and resistence to segregation and remarcable filling and passing ability make self compacting concrete suitable to intervene on existing structures, since it’s neccesary to assure that the new material could really restore element continuity and homogeneity (crossing new and existing reinforcing bars without causing hollow spaces inside the element and discontinuity in the contact surface). C-FRP (Mapewrap C UNI-AX 300 / 10) jacket is applied to upgrade ductility in tall piers and to increase shear strength in squat piers to match EC 8 prescriptions. Confinement increases concrete compressive strength and ultimate strain and also provide longitudinal bars constraint against buckling preventing cover spalling. According to Monti et al. approach, using 0. 167 mm thick C-FRP, 1 layer is needed to obtain the required ductility upgrade. FRP jacket to get EC 8 shear strength is designed following guide lines proposals (EC 8, OPCM 2003 n. 3274, CNR 2004 DT 200, FIB 2001 n. 14) either adopting suggested values or considering experimentally measured parameters neglecting safety coefficients: using 0. 167 mm thick C-FRP, 2 layers and 1 layer are needed respectively. Wrapped strips are unidirectional 100 mm wide with interval of 60 mm with the exception of the first one which is only 30 mm. FRP strips are set over the plastic hinge zone in case of tall piers and over the whole height in case of squat piers. The test equipment is composed by a system for the application of vertical loads: the specimen is placed within a testing frame realized using a 1000 kN hydraulic jack fixed to a transverse beam which is linked to the ground by means of two  60 mm steel tendons with hinged connections. A 250 KN MTS hydraulic actuator, connected on one side to the top of the pier and on other side to a <b>reaction</b> <b>wall,</b> is used to impose displacements or loads to pier. The specimen footing is restrained to the laboratory strong floor using two tranverse beams fixed to ground with steel tendonds in order to avoid any base horizontal displacements and rotations. Horizontal displacements (or loads) are applied by using the built-in MTS control system composed by an LVDT with stroke +/- 125 mm (or a 250 kN load cell), the digital controller Testar II and the acquisition software TestWare. The same system is used to acquire horizontal displacements and loads. A parallel acquisition is performed by using an external data acquisition system (DEWETRON DEWE-RACK) with 16 channels togheter with a 500 kS/s National Instruments E-Series DAQ (AT-MIO- 16 E- 1) with 16 analog inputs. In particular, the horizontal displacements of three point of the pier, placed respectively at the hight 230 mm, 450 mm and 1290 mm, are recorded using 3 linear potentiometers (stroke +/- 50 mm), whereas other 12 linear potentiometers are used for the acquisition of vertical displacements of other three different pier sections in order to estimate their curvature along the height. Finally the vertical load is acquired by means of a 1000 kN load cell. Actual cyclic quasi-static tests aim to evaluate existing piers and the effectiveness of the efficiency of repairing and retrofitting techniques. Pseudodynamic tests are foreseen in the next future. Six cyclic tests (5 displacement controlled and 1 force controlled) have been performed on a squat EC 8 pier both to evaluate its elastic stiffness and to check and calibrate test instrumentation equipment functioning. Moment-curvature diagrams and top pier total displacement, distinguishing contributions due to flexure and shear, are presented...|$|E
25|$|On May 20, 2013, Mayer led Yahoo! {{to acquire}} Tumblr in a $1.1billion acquisition. In February 2016, Yahoo! {{acknowledged}} {{that the value of}} Tumblr had fallen by $230 million since it was acquired. In July 2013, Yahoo! reported a fall in revenues, but a rise in profits compared with the same period in the previous year. <b>Reaction</b> on <b>Wall</b> Street was muted, with shares falling 1.7%. In September 2013, it was reported that the stock price of Yahoo! had doubled over the 14 months since Mayer's appointment. However, much of this growth may be attributed to Yahoo!'s stake in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group, which was acquired before Mayer's tenure.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is presented to}} investigate the effect of thermophoresis particle deposition and variable viscosity on Darcy mixed convective heat and mass transfer of a viscous, incompressible fluid past a porous wedge {{in the presence of}} chemical <b>reaction.</b> The <b>wall</b> of the wedge is embedded in a uniform Darcian porous medium in order to allow for possible fluid wall suction or injection. The viscosity of the fluid is assumed to be a inverse linear function of temperature. The results are analyzed for the effect of different physical parameters, such as variable viscosity, magnetic, chemical reaction and thermophoresis parameters, on the flow, the heat and mass transfer characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The idea {{of using}} nuclear fusion {{as a source of}} {{commercial}} electrical power has been pursued worldwide since the 1950 s. Two approaches, using magnetic and inertial confinement of the reactants, are under study. This paper describes {{the difference between the two}} approaches, and discusses in more detail the heavy-ion-driven inertial fusion concept. A multibeam induction linear accelerator would be used to bring {approx} 100 heavy ion beams to a few GeV. The beams would then heat and compress a target of solid D-T. This approach is unique among fusion concepts in its ability to protect the <b>reaction</b> chamber <b>wall</b> from neutrons and debris...|$|R
