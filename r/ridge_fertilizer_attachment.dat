50|$|In late-1947, the Columbia III Planter {{had been}} {{introduced}} along with a <b>fertilizer</b> <b>attachment.</b> According to a December 18, 1947 advertisement, the new Columbia III Planter was a power-agitated attachment which had two adjustable opening shoes. The fertilizer was sowed in two bands with the seeds planted in-between the fertilizer bands. Roths Industries stated that this eliminated the danger of damaging the seeds during germination. The planter accurately planted all types of seeds from the smallest flower seed to the largest seed, including Spanish Peanuts in the shell. Any desired seed spacing could be obtained. Roths Industries also had special seed cylinders that could be furnished to suit {{a wide range of}} requirements.|$|R

40|$|No-till {{management}} {{results in}} {{little or no}} incorporation of residues and fertilizers with soil. Broadcast fertilization could be inefficient with no-till because phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) accumulate near the soil surface. Banding fertilizers at shallow depths with the planter or deeper before planting could be more effective. A study was initiated in 1994 at this farm and at four other research farms to evaluate P and K fertilizer placement for corn and soybeans managed with no-till and chisel-plow tillage. The study consists of four separate trials: P for corn, P for soybeans, K for corn, and K for soybeans. Both crops are grown on Marshall soil in rotation by alternating crops each year between adjacent areas. The tillage and fertilization treatments are applied for both crops, which are planted with 30 -in. row spacing. Cornstalks of plots managed with chisel-plow tillage are chisel plowed {{in the fall and}} field cultivated in spring, whereas soybean residues are only field cultivated in spring.

40|$|A planter for {{small-scale}} arable farmers {{has been}} designed and tested at the Farm Machinery Development Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture in Sebele, Botswana. The Sebele Standard Planter is a hand-held, animal-drawn planter which distributes seeds evenly while planting. It has a net weight of 40 kg and requires one or two oxen or two donkeys to pull it. The planter comprises a hopper mounted on a frame, with wheels and a special steel blade opener for hard soil and an optional <b>fertilizer</b> <b>attachment.</b> The capacity of the seed hopper is 3 - 4 kg {{depending on the type}} of seed. The feed mechanism operates by means of a sprocket and chain driven agitator. with a 1 6 -seed hole metering plate which controls the rate at which seeds are dispensed.

40|$|The {{technology}} of maize planting in width line and narrow line alternately has been being studied for many years. The {{results showed that}} the technology may improve soil environment; promote maize growth; enhance amount of roots, leaf area; foster ability of soil production; reduce invested capital of the production; enhance maize yield; and increase economic benefit. Key words: Maize, technique of wide/narrow planting, high stubble, planting technique of alternation, research Operation procedures of maize planting in wide line and narrow line alternately present uniformly ridge with 65 cm width in a field which is altered to wide ridge with 90 cm width, and narrow ridge with 40 cm width. Maize is planted in the narrow <b>ridge.</b> <b>Fertilizer</b> application and loosing the soil is done with top application in the width ridge. The remaining maize stalk stubbles with 40 cm height on seedling strip narrow ridge are obtained during harvest time. Ploughing is done at the wide ridge with strip rotary cultivator after autumn harvest. The stubbles are returned to the field. During the second spring, seeds are planted on the wide ridge and become narrow with the growth of the seedlings.

40|$|In arid and {{semi-arid}} lands (ASALs), low {{adoption of}} integrated soil fertility and water management (ISFWM) technologies {{has contributed to}} food and nutrition insecurity. A {{study was conducted to}} assess factors influencing smallholder farmers’ adoption decision of ISFWM technologies in Mwala and Yatta Sub-Counties. A questionnaire was administered to 248 respondents in the study region. Selection of household heads was done in ‘Farmer-led adoption approach’ sites otherwise known as Primary and Secondary Participatory Technology Evaluations (PPATEs and SPPATEs) and Non-PPATEs/SPATEs sites in both Sub-Counties. Relationships between different variables were determined by the Tobit model. The results revealed that group membership (P< 0. 016), inaccessible credit services (P< 0. 017), gender (P< 0. 025), age and access to agricultural extension services (P< 0. 027) influenced adoption of ISFWM technology significantly. Cost of inputs and access to radio information (P< 0. 01), access to appropriate farm machines (p< 0. 001), cost of labor and farmers’ perception on seasons’ reliability (P< 0. 004) and out-put markets (P< 0. 006) were reported to affect adoption of ISFWM practices highly significantly. Descriptive statistic results indicated that majority of the respondents (93. 9 %) in the project areas were adopting a combination of tied <b>ridges,</b> organic <b>fertilizer</b> and improved seed compared to only 6. 1 % in the non-project area. There was also significantly (P< 0. 01) higher adoption (76. 5 %) of a combination of tied <b>ridges,</b> both <b>fertilizer</b> and improved seed in the project area in contrast to merely 23. 5 % in non-project area, as well as those adopting (80 %) a combination of zai pit, both fertilizer and improved seed compared to only 20 % in non-project area. Policy makers should focus on availability of affordable credit facilities and farm machines, ease access to information, labor and input-output markets for enhanced farm productivity and livelihoods of the smallholder farmers in ASALs...|$|R

40|$|The Soil Sample The {{starting}} point for any fertilizer program, regardless of the tillage system, is obtaining a representative soil sample. Without knowing which nutrients are needed, the questions of what fertilizer {{and how much to}} apply become irrelevant. Two types of soil samples should be obtained: the traditional, zero to 8 -inch sample for general fertility (pH, phosphorus, potassium, organic matter, etc.) and deep, subsoil samples for nitrate. Subsoil samples for nitrate should be taken to a depth of at least 3 feet. The problem of how to obtain a representative soil sample is particularly relevant in ridge-tilled fields. On conventionally tilled fields, mixing occurs and fertility levels may be fairly uniform throughout the top 6 - 8 inches of soil. In a ridge-till system, much less soil mixing occurs. This is a concern where phosphorus fertilizer has been banded in the past, since phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil. This is in contrast to nitrogen which is relatively mobile and will dissipate away from a band with time. If ridges are maintained for several years and phosphorus is banded each year in the same relative location, concentrated phosphorus zones can develop. These can cause wide variations in soil test results and fertilizer recommendations. In order to know how to sample a ridge-tilled field, it helps to know the fertilization history of the field, including how fertilizer was applied in the past, and how long the practice was maintained. This situation presents somewhat of a dilemma: should the band be avoided or included in the soil sample? This question is still being researched. For now, the best suggestion is to sample in the shoulder of the ridge (Figure 1), where some soil mixing will have occurred. Any bands placed in the <b>ridge,</b> or <b>fertilizer</b> broadcast and located in the furrow, will be mixed with bulk soil during planting, cultivation and ridging. Consequently, the shoulder of the ridge may be representative of the field in general. Also, the shoulder of the ridge will normally be drier than the furrow and easier to sample. Band placement of phosphorus, with or without other nutrients, can result in concentrated zones of phosphorus building up in the soil (Figure 1). After several years of repeatedly banding phosphorus in the same location, it may be advisable to separately sample the banded zones and areas between bands. If soil phosphorus levels are quite high where bands have been repeatedly applied, it may not be necessary to apply phosphorus until these levels are reduced...|$|R
