2500|$|Only {{about one}} quarter of the land is under {{cultivation}} – mainly in cereals. Barley, wheat and potatoes are grown in eastern parts of Scotland such as Aberdeenshire, Moray, Highland, Fife and the Scottish Borders. The Tayside and Angus area is a centre of production of soft fruits such as strawberries, raspberries and loganberries, owing to the mild climate. [...] Sheep raising is important in the less arable mountainous regions, such as the northwest of Scotland which are used for <b>rough</b> <b>grazing,</b> due to its geographical isolation, poor climate and acidic soils. Parts of the east of Scotland (areas such as Aberdeenshire, Fife and Angus) are major centres of cereal production and general cropping. In such areas, the land is generally flatter, coastal, and the climate less harsh, and more suited to cultivation. The south-west of Scotland – principally Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway – is a centre of dairying. Agriculture, especially cropping in Scotland, is highly mechanised and generally efficient. Farms tend to cover larger areas than their European counterparts. Hill farming is also prominent in the Southern Uplands in the south of Scotland, resulting in the production of wool, lamb and mutton. Cattle-Rearing particularly in the east and south of Scotland results in the production of large amounts of beef. Farming in Scotland was affected by BSE and the European ban on the importation of British beef from 1996. Dairy and Cattle farmers in south-west Scotland were affected by the 2001 UK Foot and Mouth outbreak, which resulted in the destruction of much of their livestock as part of the biosecurity effort to control the spread of the disease.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{boundary}} integral method for the nu-merical {{solution of the}} rigorous problem of wave scattering from <b>rough</b> surfaces under <b>grazing</b> illumination. The model of a locally perturbated plane is adopted: a finite patch of rough surface has its roughness flattened at the edges. The boundary formulation un-knowns are the tangential components of the scattered field, de-fined as the contribution from the rough area. This way, the nu-merical domain of study is correctly bounded, even with a plane wave as incident field, and the sampled area is made independent of the incidence. This rigorous approach, called the grazing method of moments, is implemented on two-dimensional perfectly conducting surfaces and validated by comparison with a reference numerical solution for surfaces with Gaussian correlation functions. Now, the validity of approximate models at low-grazing-angles can be inves-tigated; the small perturbation method and the small slope approx-imation are addressed in this paper. Scattering diagrams show how the performances of these methods deteriorate drastically at back-ward scattering angles as the incidence goes to grazing.

40|$|During recent decades, <b>rough</b> {{livestock}} <b>grazing</b> {{has decreased}} markedly on unimproved land (i. e. natural and seminatural habitats) across most of Europe, whilst {{the number of}} wild cervids has increased. However, we still know little about the overall changes in the herbivore pressure and how herbivore regimes vary between biogeographic regions. We have quantified the spatio-temporal variation in herbivore pressure indirectly by estimating the metabolic biomass of large herbivores in mountain, coastal and inland municipalities of Norway every 10 th year during 1949 - 1999. We quantified how much livestock biomass has decreased, whether this corresponded to increasing cervid biomass, and whether the proportion of grazing relative to browsing has changed within the herbivore community. Total metabolic biomass of livestock and cervids (MBAtotal) decreased from 126 kg/km 2 in 1949 to 107 kg/km 2 in 1999 (; 85 % of MBAtotal in 1949). Changes differed markedly between regions. Herbivore pressure in the coastal region nearly halved from 1949 to 1999, while the decrease was minor in the inland and mountain regions. Livestock grazing more than halved, whereas the metabolic biomass of cervids increased by 276 % from 1949 to 1999. Cervids dominated the community of large herbivores on unimproved land in Norway in 1999 (54 % of MBAtotal). Livestock dominated in the mountain (52 % ofMBAtotal) and in the coastal region (54 % ofMBAtotal) in 1999, while cervids dominated in the inland region (67 % of MBAtotal). Most herbivore foraging consisted of grazing in 1949 (89 % at a national scale). This proportion was reduced to 54 % by 1999. Percent browsing was especially high (. 90 %) in several municipalities in southeastern Norway in 1999. The increase of wild cervids is exceptional in a historical perspective, and managers have to adapt to wild cervids being the major ecosystem engineers in many landscapes...|$|R

5000|$|The White Park is a medium-large, long-bodied bovine. A {{program of}} linear assessment, {{including}} 200 bulls and 300 cows, {{has been carried}} out in the UK since 1994 to define its size and conformation. The weight of a mature bull varies from 800 to 1000 kg, depending on the quality of grazing, while adult cows are typically 500 to 700 kg. Their coloration is a distinctive porcelain white with coloured (black or red) points. The horns of the cows can vary in shape, but the majority grow forwards and upwards in a graceful curve. The horns of the bulls are thicker and shorter. In their native environment in Britain, White Park cattle are known for their distinctive appearance and their grazing preference for coarse terrain. White Park cattle are well-suited to non-intensive production. Some herds are kept outside throughout the year on <b>rough</b> upland <b>grazing</b> without shelter or supplementary feed. They are docile, easy-calving, and have a long productive life. Some traits may vary depending on their location.Until recently, White Park cattle were a triple-purpose breed used for meat, milk and draught. The 3rd Lord Dynevor (1765-1852) kept a team of draught oxen, and the practice continued up to 1914. They were used as dairy cattle even more recently. Some cows were being milked in the Dynevor herd in 1951, but yields were moderate. Beef became the main product during the twentieth century, and gained a reputation as a textured meat, with excellent flavor and marbling, which commanded a significant premium in specialty markets. [...] The white park, a breed I’ve never eaten before and had always assumed was purely ornamental, was really excellent: softly chewy, with that strong, distinctive, almost corrupt flavour of proper beef A.A. Gill Several blood typing and DNA studies have revealed the genetic distinctness of White Park cattle. The colour-pointed coat pattern also appears in other cattle breeds such as the Irish Moiled, the , the Berrenda, the Nguni and the Texas Longhorn. The breeds most closely related seem to be the Highland cattle and Galloway cattle of Scotland, but the White Park [...] "is genetically far distant from all British breeds".|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the behavior of}} the scattered electromagnetic waves from non-Gaussian ocean surfaces at near grazing incidence. Even though the scattering mechanisms at moderate incidence angles are relatively well understood, the same is not true for near <b>grazing</b> <b>rough</b> surface scattering. However, from the experimental ocean scattering data, it has been observed that the backscattering cross section of a horizontally polarized wave can be as large as the vertical counterpart at near grazing incidence. In addition, these returns are highly intermittent in time. There have been some suggestions that these unexpected effects may come from shadowing or feature scattering. Using numerical scattering simulations, it can be shown that the horizontal backscattering cannot be larger than the vertical one for the Gaussian surfaces. Our main objective {{of this study is to}} gain a clear understanding of scattering mechanisms underlying the near grazing ocean scattering. In order to evaluate the backscattering cross section from ocean surfaces at near grazing incidence, both the hydrodynamic modeling of ocean surfaces and an accurate near grazing scattering theory are required. For the surface modeling, we generate Gaussian surfaces from the ocean surface power spectrum which is derived using several experimental data. Then, weakly nonlinear large scale ocean surfaces are generated following Longuet-Higgins. In addition, the modulation of small waves by large waves is included using the conservation of wave action. For surface scattering, we use MOM (Method of Moments) to calculate the backscattering from scattering patches with the two scale shadowing approximation. The differences between Gaussian and non-Gaussian surface scattering at near grazing incidence are presented...|$|R
40|$|Plasma etching {{processes}} often roughen {{the feature}} sidewalls forming anisotropic striations. A {{clear understanding of}} the origin and control of sidewall roughening is extremely desirable, particularly at the gate level where variations in line width can adversely impact the electrical performance of the device. In addition, at the back end, feature sidewall roughness of the dielectric materials might degrade the resolution of contacts, interfere with the deposition of conformal liner materials, and make the process integration challengeable. In an inductively coupled plasma apparatus, the etching behavior on real feature sidewalls was simulated by etching blank films at grazing ion bombardment angles. The angular etching yields of polysilicon and dielectric materials in Ar, C 12 /Ar, and C 4 F 8 /Ar plasma beams were studied as a function of ion bombardment energy, ion bombardment angle, etching time, plasma pressure, and plasma composition. Interestingly, the effective neutral-to-ion flux ratio was the primary factor influencing the etching yield. A typical sputtering angular yield curve, with a peak around 600 off-normal angle, was formed at non-saturated etching regime, while an ion-enhanced-etching angular yield curve peaked around 650 was observed in the saturated etching regime. (cont.) In Ar plasma, various films remained smooth after etching at normal angle but became <b>rougher</b> at <b>grazing</b> angles. Specifically, the striation structure formed at grazing angles could be either parallel or transverse to the beam impingement direction. Encouragingly, the sputtering caused roughening at different off-normal angles could be qualitatively explained by the corresponding angular dependent etching yield curve. In fluorocarbon plasmas, the roughening of thermal silicon dioxide and low-k coral films at grazing ion bombardment angles depended on both the etching kinetics and the etching chemistry. In particular, the surface roughened when the etching process was physical-sputtering like (at low neutral-to-ion flux ratios), even though the polymer deposition effect was trivial; when the etching kinetics was dominated by ion-enhanced etching (at high neutral-to-ion flux ratios), the roughening was mainly caused by the local polymer deposition effects. Moreover, surfaces could be etched without roughening at intermediate neutral-to-ion flux ratios and/or with the addition of oxygen to the discharge. The oxygen addition broadened the region over which etching without roughening can be performed. (cont.) Additionally, the local-polymer-deposition effect can be used to explain the surface roughening of porous low-k films in fluorocarbon plasmas. Last, it was shown that RMS roughness is not adequate to represent the surface roughness on etched surfaces, especially when anisotropic striations exist. Instead, statistical methods such as the power spectral density and geostatistical analysis are capable of measuring the surface roughening in both vertical and lateral dimensions. In this way, the spatial variation of the streaks formed during plasma etching can be characterized quantitatively. by Yunpeng Yin. Thesis (Ph. D.)
