2500|$|The low {{aspect ratio}} wings were {{parallel}} edged and almost square tipped, with the thin airfoil section {{typical of the}} time. [...] They were built around two spars, each a spruce-ash-spruce sandwich, and the profile was formed with mixed spruce and ash ribs. Both spars fitted into sockets formed by two transverse fuselage struts, but the <b>rear</b> <b>socket</b> was made oversize and the spar attached with a bolt and split pin to allow movement, as the Dyott was laterally controlled by wing warping. The main in-flight aerodynamic forces on each wing were carried by pairs of cables to the front spar from the forward skid mounting point, an arrangement that caused some concern over the transfer of landing loads to the wing. Each wing was braced from above with four wires, two to each spar, from an inverted V steel pylon {{just in front of}} the cockpit. [...] A short vertical steel post below the rear of the cockpit carried pairs of wing warping wires to the rear spar.|$|E
5000|$|M8 (diesel) Hellenic Army armored car: {{a number}} of M8 armored cars were {{upgraded}} with a Steyr diesel engine {{in place of the}} Hercules JXD gasoline engine, this required a rearwards extension of the engine compartment by 11.8 in, as well as some heightening. Also fitted were a new radio, indicator and new hooded lights, rear view mirrors, while the M2HB anti-aircraft machinegun was moved to the right front of the turret, where a new pintle socket was bolted on the partial roof (the turret <b>rear</b> <b>socket</b> being retained) and the coaxial 0.30-in M1919A4 replaced by a 7.62Ã—51mm NATO MG3 machinegun. Used for coastal defense and retired from service in the late 1990s.|$|E

50|$|Some known {{problems}} {{include the}} front spring perch has corroded and tearing {{away from the}} inner fender (wing), causing the front suspension to collapse. (4Matic models are not believed to be affected.) Other problems include defective harmonic balancer pulleys (recall), rust on trunk lid near latch, rust on Mercedes emblem on front hood, rust on door frames under window seals (recall), rust on front wings just above bumper, defective mass airflow meter, melted <b>rear</b> light bulb <b>sockets,</b> defective blower motor regulators, and rear window regulator failures.|$|R
5000|$|A {{computer}} mouse {{is a small}} handheld device that users hold and slide across a flat surface, pointing at various elements of a graphical user interface with an on-screen cursor, and selecting and moving objects using the mouse buttons. Almost all modern personal computers include a mouse; it may be plugged into a computer's <b>rear</b> mouse <b>socket,</b> or as a USB device, or, more recently, may be connected wirelessly via an USB dongle or Bluetooth link. In the past, mice had a single button that users could press down on the device to [...] "click" [...] on whatever the pointer on the screen was hovering over. Modern mice have two, three or more buttons, providing a [...] "right click" [...] function button on the mouse, which performs a secondary action on a selected object, and a scroll wheel, which users can rotate using their fingers to [...] "scroll" [...] up or down. The scroll wheel can also be pressed down, and therefore {{be used as a}} third button. Some mouse wheels may be tilted from side to side to allow sideways scrolling. Different programs make use of these functions differently, and may scroll horizontally by default with the scroll wheel, open different menus with different buttons, etc. These functions may be also user-defined through software utilities. Mice traditionally detected movement and communicated with the computer with an internal [...] "mouse ball", and used optical encoders to detect rotation of the ball and tell the computer where the mouse has moved. However, these systems were subject to low durability, accuracy and required internal cleaning. Modern mice use optical technology to directly trace movement of the surface under the mouse and are much more accurate, durable and almost maintenance free. They work on a wider variety of surfaces and can even operate on walls, ceilings or other non-horizontal surfaces.|$|R
