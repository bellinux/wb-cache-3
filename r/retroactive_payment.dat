40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} social insurance, family support and work capacity enhance individuals' economic well-being following significant health and income shocks. I first examine {{the extent to}} which the liquidity-enhancing effects of Worker's Compensation (WC) benefits outweigh the moral hazard costs. Analyzing administrative data from Oregon, I estimate a hazard model exploiting variation in the timing and size of a <b>retroactive</b> lump-sum WC <b>payment</b> to decompose the elasticity of claim duration with respect to benefits into the elasticity with respect to an increase in cash on hand, and a decrease in the opportunity cost of missing work. I find that the liquidity effect accounts for 60 to 65 percent of the increase in claim duration among lower-wage workers, but less than half of the increase for higher earners. Using the framework from Chetty (2008), I conclude that the insurance value of WC exceeds the distortionary cost, and increasing the benefit level could increase social welfare. Next, I investigate how government-provided disability insurance (DI) interacts with private transfers to disabled individuals from their grown children. Using the Health and Retirement Study, I estimate a fixed effects, difference in differences regression to compare transfers between DI recipients and two control groups: rejected applicants and a reweighted sample of disabled non-applicants. I find that DI reduces the probability of receiving a transfer by no more than 3 percentage points, or 10 percent. Additional analysis reveals that DI could increase the probability of receiving a transfer in cases where children had limited prior information about the disability, suggesting that DI could send a welfare-improving information signal. Finally, Zachary Morris and I examine how a functional assessment could complement medical evaluations in determining eligibility for disability benefits and in targeting return to work interventions. We analyze claimants' self-reported functional capacity in a survey of current DI beneficiaries to estimate the share of disability claimants able to do work-related activity. We estimate that 13 percent of current DI beneficiaries are capable of work-related activity. Furthermore, other characteristics of these higher-functioning beneficiaries are positively correlated with employment, making them an appropriate target for return to work interventions...|$|R

I find the liquidity effect is 1. 5 times as large as the moral hazard effect for claimants with pre-injury earnings below the median wage in Oregon. By contrast, I find little evidence of a liquidity effect for claimants with pre-injury earnings above the median wage.

40|$|Depuis {{longtemps}} on est à la recherche d'un substitut à la grève traditionnelle qui sauvegarderait le recours à l'utilisation de pressions économiques dans les négociations collectives et en même temps éviterait les inconvénients dont souffrent les consommateurs. Cette étude a pour but d'étudier l'origine, la nature, les avantages et les inconvénients d'une formule qui a été préconisée : la grève-sans-arrêt-de-travail (statutory strike). The {{search for}} a means to eliminate {{the impact of a}} strike on the public without weakening the bargaining power of both management and union at the bargaining table gave rise to the statutory strike formula, also known as the non-stoppage strike formula. ORIGINThe idea was first suggested in 1949 by two Harvard professors : LeRoy Marceau and Richard A. Musgrave. (1) The following year, Professor George W. Goble (2) defined a concrete way to use the idea and in 1953, Neil W. Chamberlain (3), the well-known Yale economist, approved the principles of the formula, defining his personal view on the way to use it. In 1959, David B. McCalmont (4) published several articles on the subject without knowing at that time that the idea was not a new one. NATUREDespite these different approaches, one can draw up a profile of the Non-Stoppage Strike Formula, taking into account the four given sources :— there is no work stoppage;— the public does not have to suffer any production or service interruption;— the parties are supposed {{to be in the same}} relative bargaining positions as if the workers had walked out;— the parties are supposed to impose on each other the same economic burden as if they were involved in a regular strike. The basic hypothesis of that formula is as follows :« Aside from the inconvenience which the public suffers, the only direct result of a strike is to inflict an economic loss on both the company and the workers. It costs them both money » ( [...] .) « If therefore a system could be devised which would permit the union to inflict the identical loss upon the company without a work stoppage, the bargaining function of the strike would be preserved, yet the conflict with the public interest would be avoided.  » (5) ELEMENTSSetting up of the FormulaMarceau and Musgrave as well as Chamberlain propose the use of the formula when a conflict between management and the union is judged by the State as being an emergency dispute. The law would then force the parties to use the non-stoppage strike formula. Goble suggests the existence of a law defining the method of application of the system, available on a voluntary basis to the parties involved in the conflict. Finally, McCalmont thinks that there is no need for any legislation concerning the non-stoppage strike formula. The system could be used following the will of the parties. However, the State or any public intervention would be avoided except where agreed upon by the parties. It would be more appropriate to name the first case « statutory strike » and the two others, « non-stoppage strike ». We will use that latter term. Economic PenaltiesDuring a work stoppage, the workers are willing to give up their income in order to force the employer to accept their demands. The strike without work stoppage takes that fact into account. The workers keep on working though they receive only a part of their income. On the other hand, the employer gives up a part of the company's earnings. They negotiate under that pressure until they reach an agreement. There is no work stoppage. The same economic pressure as in a regular work stoppage forces the parties towards an agreement. How can it be done ?Marceau and Musgrave recommend requiring the company « to pay out (for all work performed) at a rate so high that the company would stand in the same profit and loss position in which it would have stood, had the work stoppage gone ahead » and the workers would receive « a rate so low that, in actual fact, they would be under the same economic pressure that a strike would exert ». (6) Since they keep on working, they must receive a little more than that if one is to avoid placing the parties in a worse position than if the workers had really walked out. Goble would prefer to retain 25 per cent of the workers' income and 25 per cent of the managers' income plus the net profits of the company operating during a non-stoppage strike. In order to maintain the relative bargaining power of the parties, Chamberlain proposes the retention of 50 per cent of the workers' income and 50 per cent of the fixed costs of the company during the non-stoppage strike. Taking into account the fact that the employer does not lose his market and that the workers have no equal advantage, another penalty would be added to the employer by retaining all his net profits. The penalties suggested by McCalmont are much alike those of Marceau and Musgrave. They would be as follows : 50 per cent of the owner's income and 50 per cent of the difference between the company's income with and without a work stoppage ; the latter amount being defined in the expired collective agreement to avoid the problems of setting it up. Use of the Trust Fund ReceiptsOn this specific point, Marceau and Musgrave, Chamberlain, and McCalmont suggest that these amounts be retained each week during the non-stoppage strike negotiations until the agreement is reached. Goble adds the possibility of the parties recovering all the money withheld if they settle within 90 days. If not, another period of the same length with the same penalties would begin until the agreement is reached. Musgrave, Chamberlain and McCalmont would use these amounts to finance public services in the community or to help finance the general needs of the government (strike tax). Marceau suggests using the money withheld to pay <b>retroactive</b> <b>payments</b> to the parties, hoping that this will bring them to agree upon the formula. EXPERIENCESAs far as we have been able to determine, there is only one collective agreement which includes a non-stoppage strike clause. It was signed by Dunbar Furniture Corporation (Indiana) and Local 222 of the Upholsterers International Union (AFL-CIO) on May 1, 1964. It can be described as follows :« The strike-work provisions are activated on receipt of written notice of a strike or lockout. The provisions immediately ban such action; reinstate the terms of the basic contract (whose expiration is a condition for a strike or lockout); and stipulate that the ban will continue during the first twelve payroll weeks after the notice is received. Until a settlement is reached within this period, if it is, half of the weekly earnings of bargaining unit employees (including holiday and vacation pay that may become due) is withheld by the company. This money is placed in a 'strike work trust fund', for which the First Bank of Berne is the fiduciary. The company also turns over to the fund an amount equal to the total withheld from the employees' pay ». When the basic contract dispute is settled, the company and its employees can regain the money turned over to the trust according to the following schedule :Settlement during the       proportion of money returned   first 6 weeks                         100 %    7 th — 9 th week                      75 %    10 th — 11 th week                  50 %    12 th week                         25 %   After the 12 th week               noneIf the twelfth week ends without a settlement, the basic contract can be terminated on written notice and a regular strike or lockout can begin. If such notice is not received by the end of the first following week (the thirteenth), the contract is renewed automatically and without change. In this case the contract is not terminable until a year from its original, pre-notice expiration date. (7) Since their agreement on that formula, the parties have renegotiated their contract but without having to use the strike-work provisions. There is another experience of non-stoppage strike which took place in Miami, Florida. It was not part of the agreement but was a decision taken by the parties after three days of regular strike. (8) The Miami Transit Company and its striking employees agreed to provide free bus service for the city. The bus drivers agreed to provide their services free and the employer was to pay for fuel and maintenance of the buses. The drivers were not to receive any subsidies during the period other than those payments authorized by the union. The system worked for only three days and ended because the bus company president charged that his investigators had found some drivers accepting tips from riders. They returned to a formal strike. (9) This case is so particular that it could not be extended to other sectors of our economy. It is presented for its originality rather than for its possible application elsewhere. PLAN ADVANTAGES AS ESTIMATED BY THE PROMOTORSThe great winner with the formula is the public because it does not have to change its practices as there is no work stoppage. However, in the opinion of the proposers, both the workers and management gain with the formula. Let us now turn to the advantages for them. (10) For the workers :— they receive a bigger pay during the non-stoppage strike than if they had walked out;— the demoralization which comes from being idle, as required by the regular strike, is not present;— the bad feeling and dangers of the picket line are eliminated;— the risk of the company beating the strike by employing strike breakers is avoided;— the bargaining power of the union is not weakened since they are supposed to maintain the same economic pressure as if they had gone on strike;— It is an excellent occasion for the union to improve its public image. For the employer :— the damage to property, which sometimes results from a picket line, are eliminated;— all expenses incidental to a shut down are eliminated;— the disruption which comes to the operation of the business, to its market|$|R
40|$|Le but de cet article est de décrire l'effet de l'inflation sur les salaires réels, de décrire les principes théoriques régissant la mise sur pied de contrats qui prévoient les indemnités de taux de salaires en termes réels et d'examiner la {{relation}} entre ces principes et leur application aux conventions collectives. The {{purpose of}} this article is to describe the effect of inflation on real wages, to describe the theoretical principles involved in designing contracts that provide wage rate benefits in real terms, and to examine the relation between these principles and their application to collective agreements. Available evidence indicates that one result of rapidly rising consumer prices during 1972 and 1973 was to produce negligible changes in real wages even though money wage rates were rising relatively rapidly. Two basic approaches to negotiating acceptable money wage increases designed to take account of inflation are commonly used. In the first approach union negotiators estimate expected rates of inflation over the life of the contract and determine the amount of money wage increase necessary to neutralize the effectof increased prices on purchasing power. To this amount, they then add money wage demands sufficient to achieve hoped for increases in real wages. In the second approach wage rates are indexed to a consumer price index series so that a rise in the index automatically results in the adjustment of worker's earnings. These arrangements are known as cost of living allowance (COLA) or escalator clauses. C. P. I. Indexes and the Principle of Maintaining the Real Value of Money Wages. In order to correctly estimate an expected change in the C. P. I. or to properly utilize a C. P. I. in a COLA formula it must be decided whether it is real wage rates that are being examined between two specificpoints in time or whether it is average real wage rates being examined between twoperiods of time. Use of the C. P. I. Index Front One Specific Date to Another. If prices increase steadily throughout the year at a rate of 12 percent per year, money wage rates should increase steadily throughout the year at the same rate. Use of the Annual Average Consumer Price Index. The annual average method is equivalent to asking how much prices were higher in each month in 1973 as compared to the same month in 1972 and to average these increases. The use of the average annual method is appropriate for the case where it is theaverage real wage rate of the base period that should be protected. In this case, the real wage rate was not constant during the base period but was declining as prices were rising. The Use of a Cost of Living Allowance or Escalator Clause to Maintain the Real Value of Wage Rates. It is not practical to adjust money wages as soon as prices change and consequently wage adjustments can be made with a lag by using some formula relating increases in the C. P. I. to increases in money wage rates. Workers will have been paying higher prices for some time before their money wage rate is adjusted. There is a loss in real wages due to this lag as compared to the case where real wages are kept constant by increasing money wages as soon as prices increase. The Cost of Living Allowance in the Contract Between the Quebec Government and the Public Sector Employees. The cost of living allowance used in the contract between the Quebec Government and the public sector employees is a useful one to examine since its covers a large group of employees and it is interesting case in its own right because of its multiple facets. When wages are adjusted according to the expected rate of increase in consumer priées the problem is to correctly predict the actual rate. If the predicted rate ofincrease in the C. P. I. is used to adjust wages and the actual rate turns out to be higher than the predicted rate, workers will have lost real wages. The Quebec case eliminates this problem by a two step approach to wage adjustment : firstly, wages are adjusted according to the predicted increase in consumer prices, and secondly a <b>retroactive</b> lump sum <b>payment</b> is provided to cover any decrease in real wages due to a higher actual rate of increase in consumer prices. Applications. The proceeding discussion has emphasizedprinciples that must be applied if a COLA provision is to maintain a real wage base during a contract period. Examination of COLA clauses in contracts in large unionized enterprises in 1972 and 1973 reveals that these clauses seldom succeeded in accomplishing this goal. Principles and Practice. This article has attempted to show that the ability of negotiators to achieve a real wage goal requires careful consideration of the underlying principles that are applied in alternative techniques used to reach this goal...|$|R
