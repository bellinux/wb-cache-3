40|$|Recently, a {{turbulent}} boundary layer is generally used to investigate wind effects of tallbuildings. In this case, {{it is thought that}} the <b>flow</b> in the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> is usually devided into themean and fluctuating components, and each statistic has a unique value if an averaging time is de-termined. However, in practice, each statistic is changed in according to the length of this aver-aging time, and it is not uniquely determined. This is caused by the fluctuating components witha longer period than averaging time in the <b>flow</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel.</b> So the experiments were conductedin some <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> investgating the low frequency fluctuations which affect the decision of theaveraging time.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the performance of a multi-directional wind tower integrated with vertically-arranged heat transfer devices (VHTD) using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> analysis. An experimental scale model was created using 3 D printing. The scale model was tested in a uniform <b>flow</b> closed-loop <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> to validate the CFD data. Numerical results of the supply airflow were compared with experimental data. Good agreement was observed between both methods of analysis. The Grid Convergence Method (GCI) method was used to estimate the uncertainty due to discretisation. Results have indicated that the achieved indoor air speed was reduced by 8 – 17 % following the integration of the VHTD. The integration of VHTD had a positive effect on cooling performance of the wind tower, it reduced the incoming fresh air by up to 12 K. The effect of varying the number of VHTD rows (1 – 3 rows) on the system’s performance were also investigated.
