25|$|The Allegheny and Cumberland Plateaus of West Virginia are {{predominantly}} covered by hardwood forests, but along the Ohio River and its principal tributaries, the valuable timber {{has been removed}} and considerable areas have been wholly cleared over the centuries for farming and pasture lands. Among the most prevalent trees of this region are the chestnut oaks, the walnut, the yellow poplar, and the cherry. Southern West Virginia contains the largest <b>reserve</b> <b>supply</b> of timber. In the Ridge-and-Valley region of the Appalachian Mountains, the Eastern Panhandle and Potomac Highlands have a forest covering {{similar to that of}} the plateau region, however between these two areas of hardwood there is a long belt where spruce and white pine cover the mountain ridges. Other trees common in the state are the persimmon, sassafras, and, in the Ohio and Potomac Valley regions, the American sycamore. Hickory, chestnut, locust, maple, beech, dogwood, and pawpaw are widely distributed throughout the state as well. Among the state's common shrubs and vines are the blackberry, black and red raspberry, gooseberry, huckleberry, hazel, and wild grape. Ginseng is an important medicinal plant that is harvested primarily in West Virginia's southern regions. Wild ginger, elder, and sumach are common, and deep in the mountainous areas, rhododendrons, mountain laurel, and azaleas grow in abundance.|$|E

It was common for there to have been two pilots, two engineers and two passengers on board during test flights and military missions. Ballast, {{in the form of}} 10- and 20-pound (4.5 and 9.1kg) bags of sand, could be jettisoned through a pipe set into the floor of the gondola. Other equipment included [...] "a 'siren' speaking trumpet, carrier pigeons, iron pins, ropes for anchoring the airship, a <b>reserve</b> <b>supply</b> of fuel and water, and a fire extinguisher".|$|E

2500|$|Since 2002, half dollars {{have been}} minted only for collectors, due to large Federal Reserve and {{government}} inventories on hand of pre-2001 pieces; this is mostly {{due to lack}} of demand and large quantity returns from casino slot machines that now operate [...] "coinless". If and when the <b>reserve</b> <b>supply</b> runs low, the mint will again fill orders for circulation half dollars. It took about 18 years (1981â€“1999) for the large inventory stockpile of a similar low-demand circulation coin, the $1 coin, to reach reserve levels low enough to again produce circulation pieces. Modern-date half dollars can be purchased in proof sets, mint sets, rolls, and bags from the U.S. Mint, and existing inventory circulation pieces can be ordered through most U.S. banks. All collector issues since 2001 have had much lower mintages than in previous years. Although intended only for collectors, these post-2001 half dollars sometimes find their way into circulation.|$|E
2500|$|Col. Benjamin F. [...] "Grimes" [...] Davis {{proposed}} to Miles that his troopers of the 12th Illinois Cavalry, the Loudoun Rangers, and some smaller units from Maryland and Rhode Island, {{attempt to break}} out. Cavalry forces were essentially useless {{in the defense of}} the town. Miles dismissed the idea as [...] "wild and impractical," [...] but Davis was adamant and Miles relented when he saw that the fiery Mississippian intended to break out, with or without permission. Davis and Col. Arno Voss led their 1,400 cavalrymen out of Harpers Ferry on a pontoon bridge across the Potomac, turning left onto a narrow road that wound to the west around the base of Maryland Heights in the north toward Sharpsburg. Despite a number of close calls with returning Confederates from South Mountain, the cavalry column encountered a wagon train approaching from Hagerstown with James Longstreet's <b>reserve</b> <b>supply</b> of ammunition. They were able to trick the wagoneers into following them in another direction and they repulsed the Confederate cavalry escort {{in the rear of the}} column, and the southern teamsters found themselves surrounded by Federals in the morning. Capturing more than 40 enemy ordnance wagons, Davis had lost not a single man in combat, the first great cavalry exploit of the war for the Army of the Potomac.|$|E

60|$|He was a {{nasty little}} man to hold despotic sway over such a Paradise: a goblin in Fairyland. Somewhat below the middle height, he was lean {{of body and}} vulturine of face. He had a greedy mouth, a hooked nose, liquid green eyes and a sallow complexion. He was rarely seen without a half-smoked cigar between his lips. This at {{intervals}} he would relight, only {{to allow it to}} go out again; and when, after numerous fresh starts, it had dwindled beyond the limits of convenience, he would substitute another from the <b>reserve</b> <b>supply</b> that protruded from his vest-pocket.|$|E
60|$|Boots.--Several nails {{are sure}} to be knocked out after each hard day's work, {{therefore}} a <b>reserve</b> <b>supply</b> is necessary in lands where none other are to be found. No makeshift contrivance, so far as I am aware, will replace the iron last used by shoemakers when they hammer nails into the boot. There is a well-known contrivance of screws with jagged heads, for screwing into boots when a little ice has to be crossed. They do excellently for occasional purposes, but not for regular ice-work, as they are easily torn out. Crampons are soles of leather with spikes; they are tied over the shoes, but neither English mountaineers nor modern guides ever employ them: nailed boots are better.|$|E
60|$|As he did {{not want}} to be seen {{loitering}} about the sheds, he walked on, feeling puzzled. Since {{he did not}} know what stock the company had held, it was difficult to tell if coal had recently been shipped, but he imagined that some must have left the wharf after the collier had unloaded. He was used to calculating weights and cubic quantities, and the sheds were not large. Taking it for granted that the vessel had landed one thousand five hundred tons, he thought there ought to be more about than he could see. Still, if some had been shipped, he could not understand why it had been taken, at a greater cost for labor, from the last shed, where one would expect the company to keep their <b>reserve</b> <b>supply.</b> He might, perhaps, find out something from the manager, but this would need tact.|$|E

60|$|But of {{this work}} the great number of mountaineers who were {{arriving}} made little account. As fast as the ship's company, {{with the assistance of}} the priests and fighting-men, placed the cases on the quay, the engineers opened them and laid the contents ready for portage. The mountaineers seemed to come in a continuous stream; each in turn shouldered his burden and passed out, the captain of his section giving him as he passed his instruction where to go and in what route. The method had been already prepared in my office ready for such a distribution when the arms should arrive, and descriptions and quantities had been noted by the captains. The whole affair was treated by all as a matter of the utmost secrecy. Hardly a word was spoken beyond the necessary directions, and these were given in whispers. All night long the stream of men went and came, and towards dawn the bulk of the imported material was lessened by half. On the following night the remainder was removed, after my own men had stored in the Castle the rifles and ammunition reserved for its defence if necessary. It was advisable to keep a <b>reserve</b> <b>supply</b> in case it should ever be required. The following night Rooke went away secretly in the chartered vessel. He had to bring back with him the purchased cannon and heavy ammunition, which had been in the meantime stored on one of the Greek islands. The second morning, having had secret word that the steamer was on the way, I had given the signal for the assembling of the mountaineers.|$|E
