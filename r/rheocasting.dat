50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} techniques to produce semi-solid castings. For aluminum alloys the more common processes are thixocasting and <b>rheocasting.</b>|$|E
50|$|Unlike thixocasting, which re-heats a billet, <b>rheocasting</b> {{develops}} the semi-solid slurry from the molten metal produced {{in a typical}} die casting furnace/machine. This is a big advantage over thixocasting because it results in less expensive feedstock, {{in the form of}} typical die casting alloys, and allows for direct recycling.|$|E
50|$|Semi-solid {{metal casting}} (SSM) is a near net shape variant of die casting. The process is used with {{non-ferrous}} metals, such as aluminium, copper, and magnesium. The process combines {{the advantages of}} casting and forging. The process is named after the fluid property thixotropy, which is the phenomenon that allows this process to work. Simply, thixotropic fluids shear when the material flows, but thicken when standing. The potential {{for this type of}} process was first recognized in the early 1970s. There are four different processes: thixocasting, <b>rheocasting,</b> thixomolding, and SIMA.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the dry sliding wear {{behavior}} of <b>rheocast</b> A 356 Al alloys, cast using a cooling slope, {{as well as}} gravity cast A 356 Al alloy have been investigated at a low sliding speed of 1 ms(- 1), against a hardened EN 31 disk at different loads. The wear mechanism involves microcutting-abrasion and adhesion at lower load {{for all of the}} alloys studied in the present work. On the other hand, at higher load, mainly adhesive wear along with oxide formation is observed for gravity cast A 356 Al alloy and <b>rheocast</b> A 356 Al alloy, cast using a 45 degrees slope angle. Unlike other alloys, 60 degrees slope <b>rheocast</b> A 356 Al alloy is found to undergo mainly abrasive wear at higher load. Accordingly, the <b>rheocast</b> sample, cast using a 60 degrees cooling slope, exhibits a remarkably lower wear rate at higher load compared to gravity cast and 45 degrees slope <b>rheocast</b> samples. This is attributed to the dominance of abrasive wear at higher load in the case of <b>rheocast</b> A 356 Al alloy cast using a 60 degrees slope. The presence of finer and more spherical primary Al grain morphology is found to resist adhesive wear in case of 60 degrees cooling slope processed <b>rheocast</b> alloy and thereby delay the transition of the wear regime from normal wear to severe wear...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of a <b>rheocast</b> telecom component produced using Al- 6 Si- 2 Cu-Zn alloy (Stenal Rheo 1) {{was investigated in}} the as-cast, T 5 and T 6 conditions. Conventionally liquid cast samples were produced in a permanent mold and used as a reference material. In the <b>rheocast</b> component in as-cast condition, a {{thermal conductivity}} of 153 W/mK at room temperature were measured. A T 5 treatment at 250 or 300 °C increased thermal conductivity to 174 W/mK. A T 6 treatment resulted in further increase in thermal conductivity to 182 W/mK. The liquid cast alloy exhibited a lower thermal conductivity and a higher hardness for all conditions compared to the as-rheocast component. The microstructure of <b>rheocast</b> component showed material consisted of relatively large α 1 -Al particles formed during the slurry fabrication process and fine α 2 -Al particles formed in the die cavity. The macrosegregation {{in the form of}} the different ration of the primary α 1 -Al particles to secondary α 2 -Al particles in different positions of the <b>rheocast</b> component was observed. The relation between microstructural characteristics and thermal diffusivity was investigated by determining the local thermal conductivity in the <b>rheocast</b> component and ration of α 1 -Al particles to α 2 -Al particles. The results revealed that samples from the regions of the component with a high amount of α 1 -Al particles had a higher thermal conductivity. WDS measurement results pointed to that Si and Cu concentration in the α 1 -Al particles contained lower concentrations value compare to the α 2 -Al particles and therefore α 1 -Al particles has higher value for thermal conductivity. Silicon precipitation was confirmed using calorimetry and dilatometry to take place between 200 and 250 °C. A linear relation between the fraction of Si precipitates formed and the increase in thermal diffusivity was obtained. Silicon in solid solution is shown to have a strong influence (negative) on thermal conductivity. When the silicon is precipitated by heat treatment the thermal conductivity increases. For an optimal combination of thermal and mechanical properties it is therefore important to use an ageing temperature above the temperature for Si precipitation...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The paper proposes an {{overview}} of the actual most important and applied <b>rheocasting</b> technologies for the manufacturing of high performance Al components. Some excellent results recently attained in industrial applications are presented and discussed. Design/methodology/approach: Samples were machined from the produced parts and mechanical tests, i. e. tensile and impact, were executed on series of samples; moreover, microstructure features and the morphology of fractures were observed to check the quality of alloys and of produced castings. Findings: Despite the numerous <b>rheocasting</b> processes recently developed, it appears that their industrial application is still limited and some only are really interesting for the production of high performance component. The done investigations show that the use of a very simple and well controlled process leads to produce parts having excellent properties and reliability. The results obtained up to now suggest that the <b>rheocasting</b> route can be considered an attractive fabrication technology to produce high quality products, especially for aluminium alloys. Research limitations/implications: A lot of <b>rheocasting</b> processes are proposed, but for the final success it is necessary to choice a really valid process and to maintain all the steps under a strict control. Practical implications: The obtained results can be used for searching the appropriate way of improving the performance of highly stressed parts, using a very competitive and simple <b>rheocasting</b> process, contributing to make aluminium and its alloys still more attractive for light-weighting components for structural, as well as for automotive and aeronautic/aerospace applications.

In this study, A 319 cooling slope <b>rheocasting</b> billets were produced in order to obtain near spherical morphology of primary aluminium phase.

The grain size and nonuniformity were reduced by increasing the stirring speed, isothermal stirring time, or the volume fraction solid during stirring; decreased microsegregation was achieved by an increase in the volume fraction solid.

In order to characterize the microstructure of <b>rheocast</b> billets due to different superheats of 615 - 695 °C, the parallel plate compression method was employed.

40|$|Abstract. The RHEOMETAL TM {{process is}} a commercially used {{semi-solid}} process for production of high integrity cast components. The process differs from most other semi-solid casting processes in that temperature control is not necessary during processing and large amount of slurry with required solid fraction can be quickly produced. The simplicity of this process {{has led to a}} large commercial interest during the last year. This work is based on an investigation regarding the variation of as-cast mechanical properties for secondary Al-Si based alloys (~ 2. 5 % Cu) with a Si content varying from 4. 55 to 8. 90 % using the RHEOMETAL TM process. The purpose was to find the most suitable Al-Si alloy for <b>rheocasting,</b> in comparison with the common HPDC-alloy A 380 (EN-AC 46000). It was found that lower Si containing alloys exhibited better elongation but slightly lower yield strength. The alloy containing 5. 39 wt % Si showed the highest ultimate tensile strength in this investigation. The lower Si containing alloys also demonstrated better feedability in the <b>rheocasting</b> process, which is contrary to what normally is found for normal liquid casting processes.

The results of microstructural investigation revealed that the ratio of solute-lean α 1 -Al particles formed during slurry preparation to fine solute-rich α 2 -Al particles formed during secondary solidification had significant influence on thermal conductivity. The reduced amount of solutes in the α 1 -Al particles was determined as {{the root cause of}} higher thermal conductivity. A linear relation between the fraction of precipitates and the increase in thermal conductivity was obtained and silicon in solid solution is shown to have a dominant influence.

The objective is to directly compare between the electro - magnetic stirring and ultra- refining as methods of obtaining <b>rheocast</b> materials, as well as to verify the possibility of using these methodstogether.

40|$|A micromechanical {{approach}} is considered here {{to predict the}} deformation behaviour of <b>Rheocast</b> A 356 (Al-Si-Mg) alloy. Two representative volume elements (RVEs) are modelled in the finite element (FE) framework. Two dimensional approximated microstructures are generated assuming elliptic grains, based on the grain size, shape factor and area fraction of the primary Al phase of the said alloy at different processing condition. Plastic instability is shown using stress and strain distribution between the Al rich primary and Si rich eutectic phases under different boundary conditions. Boundary conditions are applied on the approximated RVEs in such a manner, so that they represent the real life situation depending on their position on a cylindrical tensile test sample. FE analysis is carried out using commercial finite element code ABAQUS without specifying any damage or failure criteria. Micro-level in-homogeneity leads to incompatible deformation between the constituent phases of the <b>rheocast</b> alloy and steers plastic strain localisation.

40|$|The {{production}} of alloys with <b>rheocast</b> structure, where the primary phase consists of globularized particles, by partial melting, involves grain recrystallization and secondary phases melting.

This work investigates the {{production of}} thixotropic material, by alternative thermomechanical treatments, of an Al- 3. 35 wt%Cu alloy. Two treatments, which avoid the hot deformation step of SIMA, are performed: Recrystallization and Partial Melting (RAP) and Overaging (OAT) processes. In the first, the as-cast, dendritic, alloy is cold deformed at ambient temperature and then heated to a constant temperature in the mushy zone, to obtain the <b>rheocast</b> structure.

40|$|Semi-solid metal (SSM) {{processing}} {{has emerged}} as an attractive method for near-net-shape manufacturing due to the distinct advantages it holds over conventional near-net-shape forming technologies. These advantages include lower cycle time, increased die life, reduced porosity, reduced solidification shrinkage, improved mechanical properties, etc. SSM processing techniques can not only produce the complex dimensional details (e. g. thin-walled sections) associated with conventional high-pressure die castings, but also can produce high integrity castings currently attainable only with squeeze and low-pressure permanent mold casting processes. There are two primary semi-solid processing routes, (a) thixocasting and (b) <b>rheocasting.</b> In the thixocasting route, one starts from a non-dendritic solid precursor material that is specially prepared by a primary aluminum manufacturer, using continuous casting methods. Upon reheating this material into the mushy (a. k. a. "two-phase") zone, a thixotropic slurry is formed, which becomes the feed for the casting operation. In the <b>rheocasting</b> route (a. k. a. "slurry-on-demand" or "SoD"), one starts from the liquid state, and the thixotropic slurry is formed directly from the melt via careful thermal management of the system; the slurry is subsequently fed into the die cavity. Of these two routes, <b>rheocasting</b> is favored in {{that there is no}} premium added to the billet cost, and the scrap recycling issues are alleviated. The CRP (Trade Marked) is a process where the molten metal flows through a reactor prior to casting. The role of the reactor is to ensure that copious nucleation takes place and that the nuclei are well distributed throughout the system prior to entering the casting cavity. The CRP (Trade Marked) has been successfully applied in hyper-eutectic Al-Si alloys (i. e., 390 alloy) where two liquids of equal or different compositions and temperatures are mixed in the reactor and creating a SSM slurry. The process has been mostly used for hypo-eutectic Al-Si alloys (i. e., 356, 357, etc.) where a single melt passes through the reactor. In addition, the CRP (Trade Marked) was designed to be flexible for thixocasting or <b>rheocasting</b> applications as well as batch or continuous casting. Variable heat extraction rates can be obtained by controlling either the superheat of the melt, the temperature of the channel system, or the temperature of the reactor. This program had four main objectives all of which were focused on a mechanistic understanding of the process {{in order to be able}} to scale it up, to develop it into a robust process,and for SSM processing to be commercially used...|$|E
