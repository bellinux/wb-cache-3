5|$|Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, {{gold and}} other {{minerals}} have been found, {{they have not}} been in large enough quantities to exploit. The 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty also restricts a struggle for <b>resources.</b> <b>In</b> 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000–01 reported landing 112,934tonnes.|$|E
5|$|Breeding pairs {{must have}} a {{territory}} of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food <b>resources</b> <b>in</b> the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.|$|E

5|$|Each clan has a {{specified}} area {{of land that}} all members contribute to foraging from and defending.

White-winged fairywrens occupy much larger territories than other fairywren species.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the problem}} was that Bordeaux may not have {{appeared}} a plausible Allied target because it was out of range of fighter aircraft cover from the United Kingdom. Historian Terry Crowdy's analysis is that Ironside may have suffered simply from lack of <b>resources.</b> <b>In</b> common with other, higher-impact, Bodyguard deceptions it preyed on a concern that the Allies knew Hitler and the German High Command had discussed.

5|$|Researchers {{focus on}} {{various aspects of}} {{cognitive}} theory to explain the seductive details effect. Seductive details impose an extraneous cognitive load during learning by enticing students to spend their limited <b>resources</b> <b>in</b> processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, {{the construction of a}} coherent mental model in the learning process. Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the extraneous cognitive load. However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere with learning within a high load learning process that requires managing the available cognitive <b>resources.</b> <b>In</b> learning situations that are associated with low working memory activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required cognitive resources available for the motivating function.|$|E
