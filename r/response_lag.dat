Griddle plate depth (front-to-back) is typically 24-inches (610mm), though compact units may be as shallow as 18 in, and deep units can be up to 30 in in depth. Typical commercial gas griddles have plates between 3/4 and 1-inch thick (19 to 25mm). Electric griddle plates are typically thinner, from 3/8 to 1/2 in thick, to reduce the <b>response</b> <b>lag</b> between the control and plate surface common in such designs (less material improves heat transfer time).|$|E

Several technical process and control issues also affect tension: tension setpoint changes, phase offset on driven rolls, tension bleed from one zone to another, and thermal effect (contraction/expansion) as the substrate passes through various processes. It {{is impossible to}} eliminate all factors requiring tension adjustment. Variance in any one factor in a zone necessitates changes in tension control and web speed.

Although many forms of phenotypic plasticity can be induced and retracted repeatedly, few extant models have analyzed conditions for the evolution of reversible plasticity. We present a general model of reversible plasticity to examine how plastic shifts in the mode and breadth of environmental tolerance functions (that determine relative fitness) depend on time <b>lags</b> in <b>response</b> to environmental change, the pattern of individual exposure to inducing and noninducing environments, and the quality of available information about the environment. We couched the model in terms of prey-induced responses to variable predation regimes. With longer <b>response</b> <b>lags</b> relative to the rate of environmental change, the modes of tolerance functions in both {{the presence or absence of}} predators converge on a generalist strategy that lies intermediate between the optimal functions for the two environments in the absence of <b>response</b> <b>lags.</b> Incomplete information about the level of predation risk in inducing environments causes prey to have broader tolerance functions even at the cost of reduced maximal fitness. We give a detailed analysis of how these factors and interactions among them select for joint patterns of mode and breadth plasticity...|$|R

40|$|The tuning of a {{constant}} velocity Kalman filter, used for tracking by a camera {{fitted with a}} variable focal-length lens, is shown to be preserved under a scale change in process noise if accompanied by an inverse scaling in the focal length, provided the image measurement error is of fixed size in image coordinates. Based on this observation, a practical method of zoom control has been built by setting an upper limit on {{the probability that the}} innovation (and hence fixation error) exceeds the image half-width. The innovation covariance matrix used to determine the innovation limit is derived over two timescales, which enables a rapid zooming out response and slower zooming in. Experimental simulations are presented, before results are given from a video-rate implementation using a camera with two motorized orientation axes and fitted with a computer-controlled zoom lens. The delays in the feedback loops, comprising image capture delay, platform <b>response</b> <b>lag</b> and zoom lens <b>response</b> <b>lag,</b> are carefully calibrated by fitting to their frequency responses. It is found that the cumulative uncertainty in delay gives rise to an image error which is part constant and part proportional to focal length, resulting in a beneficial adaptation of the filter. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

It is important to highlight that the rise in IL- 8 was less in the S group compared to the UE and E groups which may be due to less oxidative stress in this group.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} a {{class of}} interest rate rules, studied in Evans and Honkapohja (2003, 2006), that respond to public expectations and to lagged variables. Their work is extended by considering varying levels of commitment that correspond to varying degrees of <b>response</b> to <b>lagged</b> output. Under commitment the policymaker adjusts the nominal rate with lagged output to impact public expectations. Within this class of rules, I provide a condition for non-explosive and determinate solutions. Expecata-tional stability obtains for any non-negative <b>response</b> to <b>lagged</b> output. Simulation results show that modified commitment, as advocated by Blake (2001), is best under least squares learning. However, {{in the presence of}} parameter uncertainty and/or measurement error in the policymaker’s data on public ex-pectations, the best policy is one of partial commitment, where the <b>response</b> to <b>lagged</b> output is less than under modified commitment. The case for partial commitment is strengthened if the gain parameter in the learning mechanism is high, which can be interpreted as the use of few lags by public agents in the formation of expectations or as an indication of low credibility of the policymaker. The appointment of a conservative central banker ameliorates these concerns about modified commitment...|$|R

This research extends previous work by the authors (Bailes & Dean, 2005), which concluded that context-dependent effects such as the asymmetrical detection {{of an increase in}} timbre compared to a decrease of the same magnitude have a significant bearing on the cognition of sound structure. The current study replicated this effect, and demonstrated that listeners (N = 14) are coherent in their detection of segmentation between real-time and retrospective tasks. In addition, <b>response</b> <b>lag</b> was reduced from a first hearing to a second hearing, and following long (7 s) rather than short (1 or 3 s) segments.
