5000|$|Roller Electrospinning {{system a}} method for {{producing}} nanofibres was developed by Jirsak et al.. This method is known under the name Nanospider from Elmarco Company in Liberec. Roller electrospinning is the unique method which {{has been used in}} industry to produce nanofibers continuously.Nanospider consists of <b>rotating</b> <b>roller</b> to spin fibers directly from the polymer solution. This roller spinning electrode partially immersed in the tank with the polymer solution. A grounded collector electrode is placed {{at the top of the}} spinner [...] A nonwoven backing material moves along the collector electrode which makes the production of the nanofibre layer a continuous process. Many Taylor cones are simultaneously formed on the surface of the rotating spinning electrode, which makes the technology highly productive.|$|E
50|$|The Cointet-element, {{also known}} as a Belgian Gate or C-element, was a heavy steel fence about three metres wide and two metres high, {{typically}} mounted on concrete rollers, used as a mobile anti-tank obstacle during World War II. Each individual fence element weighed about 1,280 kg but was movable (e.g. with two horses) through the use of two fixed and one <b>rotating</b> <b>roller.</b> Its invention is attributed to a French colonel, Léon-Edmond de Cointet de Fillain (1870-1948, later to become general), {{who came up with the}} idea in 1933 during the run-up to World War II, as to be used in the Maginot Line. Besides their use as barricades to the entrances of forts, bridges and roads, the heavy fences are best known for their use in the Belgian Iron Wall of the KW-line and their re-use as beach obstacles on the Atlantikwall.|$|E
5000|$|The SCS process feeds {{hot rolled}} sheet steel, either as {{individual}} blanks or as a continuous strip that is uncoiled, into the SCS [...] "brushing machine". Within the machine the steel is passed between sets of <b>rotating</b> <b>roller</b> brushes that spin on an axis perpendicular to the sheet's direction of travel. The roller brush exterior is an engineered abrasive, similar to Scotchbrite, that makes contact with the steel under pressure. Each roller brush spins against the steel at a speed of 900 to 1000 revolutions per minute, [...] "scrubbing away" [...] the outer layers of mill scale - hematite and magnetite - {{and most of the}} inner layer, wustite. The remaining wustite layer is only a few micrometres thick and highly polished to a smooth surface. Three such roller brushes are typically applied to each surface of the steel sheet, for a total of six roller brushes per SCS brushing machine. Numerous spray nozzles within the brushing machine provide water to rinse the removed scale and any other debris from the steel surface and to cool the friction heat generated in the brushes. The water is filtered and re-used in this closed-loop rinsing/filtering system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Roll coating {{is widely}} used to apply a thin liquid film to a continuous, {{flexible}} substrate. It is known that macroscopic instabilities of the film system {{can result in a}} non-homogenous film growth to fluid flow. The influence of the Rossby number, the viscoelastic parameter, and the roller radius on the nonlinear hydrodynamic stability of a thin viscoelastic polymer fluid film coating flow down a rotating vertical roller is investigated. In contrast to most previous studies, the solution scheme employed in this study is based on a numerical approximation approach rather than an analytical method. The size of the explosive supercritical instability region increases significantly as the roller rotates. It is shown that the stability of the liquid film is enhanced by reducing the viscoelastic effect or decreasing the speed of the <b>rotating</b> <b>roller.</b> At higher values of the Reynolds number, the tendency of the rotation effect to prompt thin-film instability increases with an increasing roller radius...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Burnishing is a chip less {{machining}} {{process in which}} a <b>rotating</b> <b>roller</b> or ball is pressed against metal piece. It is a cold working process and involves plastic deformation under cold working conditions by pressing hard. The burnishing process help to improve surface roughness and hardness. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology adopted was using a multi roller on square titanium alloy material by designing various sliding speed/ spindle speed, feed rate and depth of penetration. Findings: The roller burnishing is very useful process to improve upon surface roughness and hardness and can be employed. It will help to impart compressive stress and fatigue life can be improved. The titanium alloy is a difficult to machine material and burnishing is difficult process for this grade material.

40|$|During the {{amorphous}} ribbon production process, {{the mechanisms}} that cause uneven thickness and herringbone on two {{surfaces of the}} ribbon are very complicated. The high velocity <b>rotating</b> <b>roller</b> causes periodic air eddies near the surface and air flow around the contact zone.

In this paper, a two-dimension model was developed to simulate the air flow eddies and a three-dimensional simulation was performed for the air flow field around the puddle zone. Simulation {{results show that the}} higher velocity of air flow around the puddle edges is closely related to thicker ribbon rim. The continuous air eddies along the roller surface and the air flow fluctuations along the roller width are the major reasons causing non-uniform convective heat transfer during ribbon solidification. The frequency of air eddy matches well with the nominal ripple frequency along the ribbon length, and the air flow fluctuation coincides with the herringbone wavelength along the ribbon width. The influences of the air flow on cooling, ribbon thickness, and herringbone phenomena are all discussed here...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Among the hundred species of pines, a third are classified as soft pines, Largely on the basis of wood and leaf anatomy. Eleven species of soft pine make up the group known variously as the pinon, pinyon, or North American nut pines. Pinus cembroides Zucc belongs to this category and is the species used in this study. The seeds of this species form an important part in the diet for humans. Most pine seeds are presently shelled by hand. Mechanical. shelling has been attempted, but the shelters damage the nuts and reduce value of the product. Improved mechanical shelling techniques are needed to provide a quality product at reasonable prices. The overall goal of this work was to develop information to establish design criteria for applying engineering principles for shelling pine nuts. The scope of the work included measurement of physical and mechanical properties of pine nuts and evaluation of one engineering principle for rupturing the seed shell. Based on the study of the physical and mechanical properties, design criteria for applying engineering principles for shelling pine nuts were developed. These summarized criteria are: 1) cracking unsoaked seeds with about 8. 9 % moisture content enhances shattering of shells at rupture, 2) deformations ranging from 0. 82 mm to 1. 14 mm is required to fracture seeds of different sizes, 3) void spaces differ according to seed size allowing deformation of shell without contacting the nut, grouping seeds in size classifications is needed to minimize nut damage, 4) compression forces to crack seeds of different size range from 159. 76 N to 304. 69 N, 5) a continuous feed process to crack seeds is needed to obtain adequate shelling, and 6) pine nut shells ruptured and shattered at low loading rates, so impact loading is not necessary for the shelling process. The engineering principles for cracking nuts were analyzed and a mechanical shelling device using counter rotating rollers for cracking nuts was constructed and tested. Results of the tests showed that the counter <b>rotating</b> <b>roller</b> principle can adequately crack 70 % in a continuous shelling method for shelling pine nuts...|$|E
