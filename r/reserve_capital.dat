The <b>reserve</b> <b>capital</b> had to be at least a third (later half) of its stock capital and at least a third of it had to be invested in Russian government bonds or deposited with the State Bank of the Russian Empire.

The bank achieved the required reserve level (4.8 million rubles) in 1904. From 1899, the bank had a second special reserve to cover investment losses. Due to requirements of keeping capital invested (mostly stocks of railway companies and Russian government bonds), the bank suffered significant losses (10.4 million rubles) in 1900–1905.|$|E

50|$|The {{world economy}} crisis is traced back by Sinn to {{an abuse of}} {{liability}} limitation by American investment banks. The lack of <b>capital</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements gave these banks the possibility to pursue their business with inadequate <b>capital</b> <b>reserves</b> and encouraged them to gamble. In addition the lack of personal liability for homeowners created {{in a similar way}} an exaggerated willingness to take risks and thus caused the United States housing bubble. To correct this situation Sinn has called for considerably higher <b>capital</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements, the balancing of offshore business and a return to the accounting principle of the lower of cost of the German Commercial Code (HGB).|$|R

Combined, these two events will have a global impact on rice prices. In Thailand, where rice farmers do not typically have much <b>reserve</b> <b>capital,</b> effects on farmers will be felt the greatest since they lost both their investment in the current crop and must wait to earn money when flood waters recede before planting a new one.|$|E
50|$|In 1893 the Cossacks {{had a total}} {{population}} of 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres (593,000 km²) of land, including 105,000,000 acres (425,000 km²) of arable land and 9,400,000 acres (38,000 km²) under forests. Each stanitsa controlled {{a share of the}} land, divided up at the rate of 81 acres (328,000 m²) per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands (which they rented to different persons), also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits for gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in 1893), went to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special <b>reserve</b> <b>capital</b> of about £2,600,000. Village taxes covered the expenditure of the village administration. Each voisko had a separate general administration, and administrative structures differed within the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, comprising representatives of each voisko, discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks.In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos had to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of World War I the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take up arms.|$|E

The main sources of formation of the financial potential of agrarian enterprises have been determined.

In general, Chinese IPOs do not underperform the market/industry benchmarks, but they significantly underperform their sizematched industry peers. More importantly, Chinese IPO firms tend to issue a large amount of bonus shares (also called as a "capitalization issue", i. e. capitalization of the reserves) after the IPO. Consistent with bonus share signaling hypothesis, Chinese IPO firms exhibit increased operating/stock performance subsequent to bonus issues. Interestingly, the size of the initial reserves is positively associated with long-run IPO stock performance. This research adds another piece of empirical evidence to the literature whether IPOs underperform in the long run, by confirming that the choice of performance measures and benchmarks could affect the conclusion on the IPO long-run performance. Further, it discovers that size of initial reserves could signal superior IPO stock performance in the long run...|$|R
