40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{we will discuss}} {{observations}} of climate change effects on agricultural pests in Europe, the possible mechanisms behind these observed effects and finally delve into more detail through some, relatively well studied model species (the Colorado potato beetle and the <b>rape</b> <b>beetle).</b> Direct {{effects of climate change}} on agricultural pests in Europe are difficult to dissect from all the human induced changes that have taken place in parallel with an increased mean annual temperature. During the last decade agriculture has become more professionalized in terms of land use, crop cultivation techniques and pest management strategies. We review the effect of climate change on agricultural pest by comparing the speed of range expansion of pest species to non-pest species. It seems that the poleward range shift has been faster for pest than non-pest species. We partly attribute this to the globalization of agriculture as human assisted movement has broken many natural dispersal barriers. Since the biology of many pest species is relatively poorly studied, direct conclusions on how climate change has affected biological processes of pests are challenging to make...|$|E
40|$|Ecosystem {{processes}} in agricultural landscapes are often triggered by resource availability in crop and noncrop habitats. We investigated how oilseed rape (OSR; Brassica napus, Brassicaceae) affects noncrop plants in managed systems and semi-natural habitat, using trophic interactions among wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis, Brassicaceae), <b>rape</b> pollen <b>beetles</b> (Meligethes aeneus, Nitidulidae) and their parasitoids (Tersilochus heterocerus, Ichneumonidae). We exposed wild mustard as phytometer plants in two cropland habitat types (wheat field, field margin) and three noncrop habitat types (fallow, grassland, wood margin) across eight landscapes along a gradient from simple to complex (quantified as % arable land). Both landscape and local factors affected {{the abundance of}} <b>rape</b> pollen <b>beetles</b> and parasitoids. <b>Rape</b> pollen <b>beetle</b> infestation and parasitism rates on these plants were lower in noncrop habitats and higher in wheat fields and field margins, whereas beetles and parasitoids responded differently to landscape scale parameters. We found the hypothesized spillover from OSR crop onto wild plants in surrounding habitats only for parasitoids, but not for pollen beetles. Parasitism rates were not related to landscape simplification, but benefited from increasing proportions of OSR. In contrast, <b>rape</b> pollen <b>beetles</b> benefited from simple landscape structures, presumably due to multi-annual population build-ups resulting from long-term OSR planting (as part of the crop rotation). In conclusion, we showed that spillover from cropland affects parasitism rates on related wild plants outside cropland, {{which has not been}} shown so far, but can be expected to be a widespread effect shaping noncrop food webs...|$|R

40|$|Biological {{pest control}} has {{primarily}} relied on local improvements in populations of natural enemies, but landscape structure {{may also be}} important. This is shown here with experiments at different spatial scales using the <b>rape</b> pollen <b>beetle</b> (Meligethes aeneus), an important pest on oilseed rape (Brassica napus). The presence of old field margin strips along rape fields was associated with increased mortality of pollen beetles resulting from parasitism and adjacent, large, old fallow habitats had an even greater effect. In structurally complex landscapes, parasitism was higher and crop damage was lower than in simple landscapes with {{a high percentage of}} agricultural use...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{organically}} cultivated {{oil seed rape}} in Germany is very high. But the risk of cultivation due to the high demand of N-supply, preceding crop, weed manage¬ment and plant protection is very high as well. In a two-year experiment, the effects of (I) preceding crop (ryegrass-clover-mixture: (a) cut mowing vs. (b) mulching, (c) peas and (d) barley-pea-mixture), (II) row distance of oil seed rape (12. 5 cm, 25 cm, 37. 5 and 50 cm) and (III) underseed in autumn together with the oil seed rape (with and without white clover) were tested in a split-plot-design with four replicates at the ex-perimental farm of the Institute of Organic Farming (FAL) in Trenthorst. The results showed a very different yield level with 0. 85 t ha- 1 in 2004, and 1. 68 t ha- 1 in 2005, which {{is a result of}} a high pressure due to blossom <b>rape</b> <b>beetles</b> (Meligethes aeneus) in 2004. The highest yield of oil seed rape was realized after the mulched ryegrass-clover-mixture with 1. 29 t ha- 1 in 2004 and 2. 48 t ha- 1 in 2005, but only in 2005 it was significantly different to the cut mowing system. In both years yield was significantly higher after ryegrass-clover compared to pea or barley-pea-mixture. In comparison of the different row distances, yield was significantly lower at the row distance of 12. 5 cm. The undersown white clover decreased the yield {{with the exception of the}} 12. 5 cm plots. This effect is caused by the weed control done with a mechanical hoe in the plots without the undersown clover combined with the wider row distances. So in these plots the heavy clay soil were aerated, which stimulated the N-mineralisation during the time of high N-demand by the oil seed rape in early springtime...|$|R
40|$|Meligethes viridescens (Fabricius), bronzed or <b>rape</b> blossom <b>beetle,</b> is a {{widespread}} and common pest of oilseed rape [Brassica napus L. and Brassica rapa L. (Brassicaceae) ] in the western Palaearctic subregion. The establishment of M. viridescens in eastern North America has raised concern that its presence is a potential risk to the Canadian canola industry, especially to the prairie ecozone of western Canada where up to 4 million ha of summer canola (B. napus and B. rapa) are grown annually. Study of museum specimens indicated that M. viridescens was first recorded in Nova Scotia in 1947. Field surveys indicated that, as of 2001, M. viridescens was established as far west as Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec. A CLIMEXTM model for M. viridescens in Europe was developed and validated with actual distribution records. In Canada the model predicted that once introduced, M. viridescens would readily survive in the canola-growing areas. The actual distribution of M. viridescens in eastern Canada matched the predicted distribution well. The westward dispersal to and establishment of M. viridescens in canola-growing areas of Ontario and western Canada, particularly southern Manitoba, appear to be inevitable. Establishment in these areas presents the risk of substantial production losses to canola producer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Habitat {{destruction}} and fragmentation of remaining habitat are major threats to global biodiversity. In this paper, we drew upon data from grassland butterflies, legume-feeding herbivores and their parasitoids, and {{the interactions between}} <b>rape</b> pollen <b>beetles</b> and their parasitoids in the agricultural landscapes of Germany to explore the following issues: (1) {{the relative importance of}} small habitat fragments for the conservation of bio-diversity (in contrast to the prevailing arguments in favor of large fragments); (2) the disruption of interspecific interactions in fragmented habitats; and (3) the relative impor-tance of the spatial arrangement of habitat fragments in landscapes of different complexity. The percentage of polyphagous butterfly species and their abundance were higher in small than in large calcareous grassland fragments, showing the relative importance of the landscape surrounding habitat fragments for less specialized species. A landscape per-spective is also needed to explain why several small fragments supported more butterfly species (even when only endangered species were considered) than the same area composed of only one or two fragments. Analyses of insects on legumes showed trophic-level dif-ferences, in that species numbers of parasitoids, but not of herbivores, benefited from habita...|$|R
40|$|Local {{community}} {{structure and}} interactions {{have been shown}} to depend partly on landscape context. In this paper we tested the hypothesis that the spatial scale experienced by an organism depends on its trophic level. We analyzed plant-herbivore and herbivore-parasitoid interactions in 15 agricultural landscapes differing in structural complexity using the <b>rape</b> pollen <b>beetle</b> (Meligethes aeneus), an important pest on oilseed rape (Brassica napus), and its parasitoids. In the very center of each landscape a patch of potted rape plants was placed in a grassy field margin strip for standardized measurement. Percent non-crop area of landscapes was negatively related to plant damage caused by herbivory and positively to the herbivores’ larval mortality resulting from parasitism. In a geographic scale analysis, we quantified the structure of the 15 landscapes for eight circular sectors ranging from 0. 5 to 6 km diameter. Correlations between parasitism and non-crop areas as well as between herbivory and non-crop area were strongest at a scale of 1. 5 km, thereby not supporting the view that higher trophic levels experience the world at a larger spatial scale. However, the predictive power of non-crop area changed only slightly for herbivory, but greatly with respect to parasitism as scales from 0. 5 to 1. 5 km and from 1. 5 to 6 km diameter increased. Furthermore, the effect of non-crop area tended to be stronger in parasitism than herbivory suggesting a greater effect of changes in landscape context on parasitoids. This is in support of the general idea that higher trophic levels should be more susceptible to disturbance. (Thies, C., Steffan-Dewenter, I. and Tscharntke, T. 2003.

40|$|The cabbage stem {{flea beetle}} (Psylliodeschrysocephala (L.) is an {{important}} pest of winter oilseed <b>rape</b> in Serbia. <b>Beetles</b> colonize oilseed <b>rape</b> in early October and are active in the field until first frost and wintertime. In autumn, adults can be seen laying eggs in the soil around plants. Larvae of P. chrysocephala developed intensively on leaf petioles in November, reaching their highest numbers {{at the end of the}} month. No infested plants were found in a conventional field, while 14. 5 % of all dissected leaf petioles were infested on an integrated field. On unprotected plants in an organic field, 76. 0 % of the plants were infested with larvae at the growth-stage BBCH 18 - 19, with 31. 1 % infested leaves on average. As a results, the number of plants was reduced by 51 %, i. e. from 43. 0 /m 2 recorded in the autumn to 22. 0 /m 2 in the following spring. A new generation of P. chrysocephala beetles emerged from the soil in the first half of June and rapidly escaped the fields from almost dry plants. Our results showed that a part of the population stayed in aestivation and emerged in the following crop during the next season. On the following 5 March, 0. 5 beetles/m 2 were found in emergence cages in the organic field, while 0. 81 beetles/m 2 were found in the former trap crop...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOviposition of {{phytophagous}} insects {{is determined}} either by adaptive behaviours allowing evaluation {{and response to}} host plant quality and/or by nutritional constraints occurring during oogenesis. Besides differences found among host plant species, plant intraspecific diversity can also affect insect oviposition. However, to date few studies have extensively investigated the factors accounting for {{the effect of this}} intraspecific variation. We addressed this question using oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and the pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus), a phytophagous insect that uses the same plants and plant organs both for feeding and laying eggs. Our objectives were to test for a genotypic effect of oilseed <b>rape</b> on pollen <b>beetle</b> oviposition and identify the origin of the possible intergenotypic differences. We tested three hypotheses: oviposition is directly linked to (1) the amount of food eaten; (2) the nutritional quality of the food eaten; (3) a preference of females for certain plant genotypes. Results showed intergenotypic differences in both the number and the size of eggs laid. The factor that best accounted for most of these differences was the amount of food eaten. Nutritional quality of the pollen was of minor importance and females exhibited no preference among genotypes. These results reveal the importance of adult feeding on subsequent oviposition in phytophagous insects, an often neglected factor which partly determines the amount of energy available for oogenesis. Taking into account this factor may be of crucial importance in studies conducted on synovogenic insect species feeding on the same plant on which they lay eggs...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{intensification}} {{has raised}} the global food production but also caused major concerns about environmental and health effects, including contamination by pesticides. Pesticide applications may induce toxicity {{not only on the}} target pest species but especially on non-target species. Hence we need to replace pesticides with management that promote organisms that suppress pest population. Natural enemies as parasitoids, spiders and ground and rove beetle can reduce pest population and contribute to the ecosystem service biological control. In this thesis I therefore study how agricultural management and land-use intensity as well as landscape composition influence the distribution of natural enemies and their functional aspects in agricultural landscapes. The studies were done in an agricultural region of southern Sweden dominated by annual crop production. Two study systems were considered. One consisting of oilseed <b>rape,</b> pollen <b>beetles</b> and parasitoid wasps that are natural enemies of pollen beetles. The other of three common agricultural lands uses, ranging from intensively managed sugar beet fields, winter wheat fields to grasslands and predatory arthropods. The results highlight that management intensity is an important factor explaining the spatiotemporal distribution of natural enemies and their biological control potential. In a functional perspective, increasing management intensity with insecticide application reduces the biological control of pollen beetles. Moreover insecticide treatment also reduce emergence of pollen beetle parasitoids the following spring. The most important factor explaining the distribution of adult parasitoids was the density of pollen beetle larva. Increased land-use intensity influenced the composition of arthropod communities. Spiders that are sensitive to disturbance were more commonly emerging in grasslands while omnivorus rove beetles and predacious macropterous ground beetles were most common in winter wheat fields. The phenology of arthropod emergence differed between the land uses and the overall dispersal tendency was higher for those emerging in crop fields compared to those emerging in grasslands. The land-use intensity also influenced the trait composition. The average body length of emerging ground beetle communities was lower in crop fields than grasslands while the average body length of actively moving communities did not differ between land uses. Further the proportion of ground beetles with good flight ability or a carnivorous diet was higher in crop fields than grasslands. To conclude, this thesis contributes to important knowledge concerning the distribution of natural enemies in the agricultural landscape in relation to management intensity. This knowledge base will be needed to develop more sustainable agricultural systems, as approaches focusing on reducing pesticide inputs as organic farming and integrated pest management (IPM) are dependent on natural enemies and their functions to be successful...|$|R
