40|$|Banks {{have become}} {{increasingly}} restrictive in their lending towards commercial <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> a development {{that is expected to}} increase due to new regulations. This has caused Swedish companies, amongst them several <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies,</b> to obtain financing through the capital markets. The main focus of this paper is corporate bonds, and those Swedish <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies</b> that have issued bonds. We distinguish between government owned and other <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies,</b> as their creditworthiness differ considerably. The research is based upon interviews with people in the industry as well as pre-existing secondary data.   The Swedish bond market is underdeveloped as Swedish companies traditionally obtain debt through bank loans. Until a few years ago, only government owned <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies</b> had issued bonds; although since 2010, several <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies</b> without government ownership have issued unsecured bonds, this as availability of bank loans has decreased due to new regulations. Increased bank funding costs and increased bank loan margins has further caused prices of bank loans to rise. Swedish banks are increasingly reluctant to finance higher LTV-levels, and loans are conditioned with an increasing number of covenants. Issues of corporate bonds provides the benefit of funding diversification – decreasing overall financial risk; and allows for higher LTVs as financing on top of bank loans. In order for corporate bonds to be an alternative to bank loans, secured bonds would have to be issued. However, there is some uncertainty regarding how such bonds would be priced. We have investigated the yield-determinants of bonds issued by <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies,</b> as well as the motives for <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies</b> to issue bonds. Investors perceive corporate bonds as an increasingly attractive investment compared to other asset classes, fuelling a development towards increased bond issues amongst <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies...</b>|$|R

Following the closing of Sagene Ring, there were increased protests against closing the tramway. Traffic had decreased on the Ekeberg Line, but proponents for keeping it stated that this was because Oslo Sporveier had reduced the frequency and moved the end station out of the core of the city center. When the proposal to close the Ekeberg Line was considered by the city council, it was decided that only the Simenbråten Line was to be closed.|$|E

40|$|Background: Within <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies</b> assets {{according}} to IFRS/ IAS 40 should be valued at fair value, {{to compare with}} previous valuation criteria {{according to}} which <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> should valued at cost. Two models can be used within IAS 40, these are value at cost and fair value. When valued at cost the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> value in the balance sheet should be specified at cost. The method chosen by the company {{should be used for}} all <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> within the <b>company</b> except for the premises used by the company. Purpose: The purpose of the study is to analyse and evaluate how <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies</b> experienced the problems that arose when converting to IAS 40, and to analyse the effects on the companies key ratios {{as a result of the}} change of accounting method. Key ratios examined were, return on equity, solvency ratio, P/E-ratio and debt/equity ratio. Method: The essay is made on a qualitative effort in the form of four interviews with experts within the chosen subject area. The compilation of key ratio is made in a quantitative form and is made up of secondary data. Conclusions: With the implementing of IAS 40 for <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> accounting, the ability to better compare the accounting between <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies</b> increased, even though all companies do not account for their <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> in the same way. It appeared that the regulation requirements need to be adjusted and formed in a way that better matches the reality in which <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies</b> act. Valuation with fair value proved to have both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage was that the comparability and the fair picture between <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies</b> increased. The disadvantage was that the valuation of the fair value gives an increased risk for the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies</b> to be over- or undervalued. A wrong valuation gives a wrong picture of the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies</b> and effects the key ratios in a volatile manner...|$|R

In the past years, we have witnessed many enterprise scandals due to careless risk management practice. The needs for more efficient corporate governance and higher risk management standard have been developed. After the global crisis, the issue of risk management is even more emphasised, and therefore the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> industry has been facing increased pressure to disclosure more risk information in their annual reports. An increasing number of risk information disclosure and more sophisticated risk management practice suggests UK <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies</b> adopt the market discipline to encourage more detailed risks in order to satisfy the stakeholders. A study of risk disclosure and risk management practices in the UK <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> industry is carried out using the sentence analysis methods. Five hypotheses are derived from the literature review and tested based on the content analysis of the annual reports and accounts of selected UK <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies.</b> The results show that the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>companies</b> are putting an increase effort on risk disclosure and risk management practice.
