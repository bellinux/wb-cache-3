Notably, hummus bi tahini, [...] mukhluta, sometimes nearly a dozen variations of eggplant salad, tabbouleh, fattoush, chili pepper and red cabbage salads and dishes made up by the chef are served. Kibbee balls and sfiha are the primary hot appetizers available. Heavy meals are rarely provided by restaurants, instead however, the entrées include shish kebab, shish taouk, <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> and chicken breasts. Falafel shops or Mahal falafel offer mainly falafel and shawarma with several different contents. They also offer hummus or tabbouleh to be served with the meal.|$|E

50|$|The {{preparation}} of pinnekjøtt uses a traditional method for food preservation utilizing curing, drying {{and in some}} regions also smoking as means of inhibiting the growth <b>of</b> micro-organisms. Although <b>lamb</b> is today available fresh or frozen all year round, pinnekjøtt is still prepared both commercially and in private homes due to the flavour and maturing the preservation process gives to the meat. In home preparation <b>of</b> pinnekjøtt, <b>racks</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> or mutton are cured in brine or coarse sea salt. Once sufficiently cured, and {{when the weather is}} cold enough, the racks are hung in a cool, dark, well ventilated place to dry. In some regions, particularly in parts of Hordaland, the fresh racks are smoked prior to curing. Traditionally this was done in order to prevent mold growth during the drying process. It was also a way that the Vikings used when transporting meat across long distances. This technique is still being used today in some countries during transport.|$|R
40|$|During July 1995, an {{outbreak}} of Salmonella typhimurium definitive type (DT) 170, an unusual strain, occurred in South Wales. A case-control study found that illness was associated with eating kebabs (odds ratio undefined, P = 0. 002), doner kebabs (odds ratio 7. 9, 95 % confidence interval 1. 5 - 20. 5, P = 0. 02) and kebabs with yoghurt based relish (odds ratio undefined, P = 0. 009) but not with eating kebabs with mayonnaise-based relish (odds ratio 2. 4, 95 % confidence interval 0. 4 - 13. 9, P = 0. 53). Environmental investigations discovered a complex web of producers and wholesale suppliers. Kebab meat and yoghurt had been supplied to the two main implicated outlets by a single wholesaler. Samples <b>of</b> raw minced <b>lamb</b> and several environmental swabs taken at the wholesaler were positive for S. typhimurium DT 170. Blood-stained, unsealed yoghurt pots were observed to be stored under a <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> raw <b>lamb.</b> Investigators <b>of</b> food poisoning outbreaks linked to takeaway food should consider cross-contaminated relishes and dressings as well as undercooked meat as potential vehicles of infection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ultrasonic wave {{transmitted}} in {{the plate}} is called Lamb wave. The dispersion characteristic <b>of</b> <b>Lamb</b> wave {{makes it very}} complicated {{to be used in}} material Nondestructive Testing (NDT). In order to solve this problem, the analysis of frequency-dispersion characteristic <b>of</b> <b>Lamb</b> wave is made in this paper, and the dispersion curves <b>of</b> the <b>Lamb</b> wave in specific plate are plotted, then the physical propagation model <b>of</b> <b>Lamb</b> wave is established. Under the analysis of FFT, the expressions <b>of</b> the <b>Lamb</b> wave in specific plate are obtained. By combining with the dispersion characteristic <b>of</b> the <b>Lamb</b> wave, the changes of waveform in different propagation distances are simulated. With the deep researches <b>of</b> new algorithms, <b>Lamb</b> wave will be applied in wider area...|$|R

5000|$|The classic {{match is}} roast lamb; game can also work well. [...] For very old vintages (pre-1959, {{but not the}} {{exceptional}} 1945) leg or <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> would be best, or partridge or grouse.
