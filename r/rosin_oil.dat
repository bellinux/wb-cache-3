40|$|Rosin is {{a natural}} product from pine forests and it {{is used as a}} raw {{material}} in resinate syntheses. Resinates are polyvalent metal salts of rosin acids and especially Ca- and Ca/Mg- resinates find wide application in the printing ink industry. In this thesis, analytical methods were applied to increase general knowledge of resinate chemistry and the reaction kinetics was studied in order to model the non linear solution viscosity increase during resinate syntheses by the fusion method. Solution viscosity in toluene is an important quality factor for resinates to be used in printing inks. The concept of critical resinate concentration, c crit, was introduced to define an abrupt change in viscosity dependence on resinate concentration in the solution. The concept was then used to explain the non-inear solution viscosity increase during resinate syntheses. A semi empirical model with two estimated parameters was derived for the viscosity increase on the basis of apparent reaction kinetics. The model was used to control the viscosity and to predict the total reaction time of the resinate process. The kinetic data from the complex reaction media was obtained by acid value titration and by FTIR spectroscopic analyses using a conventional calibration method to measure the resinate concentration and the concentration of free rosin acids. A multivariate calibration method was successfully applied to make partial least square (PLS) models for monitoring acid value and solution viscosity in both mid-infrared (MIR) and near infrared (NIR) regions during the syntheses. The calibration models can be used for on line resinate process monitoring. In kinetic studies, two main reaction steps were observed during the syntheses. First a fast irreversible resination reaction occurs at 235 °C and then a slow thermal decarboxylation of rosin acids starts to take place at 265 °C. <b>Rosin</b> <b>oil</b> is formed during the decarboxylation reaction step causing significant mass loss as the <b>rosin</b> <b>oil</b> evaporates from the system while the viscosity increases to the target level. The mass balance of the syntheses was determined based on the resinate concentration increase during the decarboxylation reaction step. A mechanistic study of the decarboxylation reaction was based on the observation that resinate molecules are partly solvated by rosin acids during the syntheses. Different decarboxylation mechanisms were proposed for the free and solvating rosin acids. The deduced kinetic model supported the analytical data of the syntheses in a wide resinate concentration region, over a wide range of viscosity values and at different reaction temperatures. In addition, the application of the kinetic model to the modified resinate syntheses gave a good fit. A novel synthesis method with the addition of decarboxylated rosin (i. e. <b>rosin</b> <b>oil)</b> to the reaction mixture was introduced. The conversion of rosin acid to resinate was increased to the level necessary to obtain the target viscosity for the product at 235 °C. Due to a lower reaction temperature than in traditional fusion synthesis at 265 °C, thermal decarboxylation is avoided. As a consequence, the mass yield of the resinate syntheses can be increased from ca. 70 % to almost 100 % by recycling the added <b>rosin</b> <b>oil...</b>|$|E

When the leaf sheaths were stripped from 1, 985 plants, exposed to artificial and natural infection in 1934, many small smut galls aggregating 39. 3 {{percent of the}} total expressed infections were found at the nodes. The symptoms of corn smut may be classed as exposed and concealed. Exposed symptoms occur as irregular yellow or reddish stripes or blotches, brownish lesions and galls. Concealed symptoms are completely hidden by the leaf sheaths and occur as small nodal galls and minute pustules of chlamydospores in the leaves of the axillary buds. A decrease in the surface tension of the inoculum increased the infectivity of the medium containing the sporidia. One percent <b>rosin</b> fish <b>oil</b> soap was found to be an effective surface tension reducing agent. The surface tension of carrot filtrate, used as a culture medium, was 47. 0 dynes per centimeter; water, 72. 3; carrot filtrate with 1 percent fish oil soap, 34. 0. Ninety-two percent of 500 sweet corn plants (Golden Bantam) became infected when inoculated with a sporidial suspension in carrot filtrate plus 1 percent fish oil soap, while 36. 6 percent of 90 similar plants became infected when inoculated with a sporidial suspension in carrot filtrate. Increased bud growth was accompanied by a larger number of nodal infections. Axillary bud growth was stimulated by injury to the corn plant, or inhibition of pollination. Injured or unpollinated inoculated plants produced approximately twice as many smut galls as the checks. Histological examination of 262 axillary buds from 50 inoculated sweet corn plants (Golden Bantam) showed 53. 6 percent or 140 of the buds to be infected with smut mycelium. Mycelium was found in apparently healthy axillary buds 67 days after inoculation. The percentage of smut infection as indicated by nodal smut galls increased with lateness in planting. An average of data for 2 years showed 12 percent on May 15 plantings while approximately 40 percent of the June 4 plantings were smutted. The percentage of smut infection as indicated by nodal smut galls showed a tendency to increase both ways from the 2 - 3 rates of planting.

And, indeed, never was I better pleased with any conquest than I was with this, there being so little bloodshed, and having an aversion to killing such savage wretches, (more than was necessary) as knowing they came on errands, which their laws and customs made them think were just and equitable. By this time, all things being in order, and the ship swimming, they found their mistake, so they did not venture a second attack. Thus ended our merry fight; and, having got rice, bread, roots, and sixteen good hogs on board the day before we set sail, not daring to go into the bay of Tonquin, but steering N.E. toward the isle of Formosa, or as tho' we would go to the Manillas, or Phillippine islands, for fear of meeting with any European ships; when we anchored at the isle of Formosa, the inhabitants not only courteously supplied us with provisions and fresh water, but dealt very fairly and honestly with us in their bargains and agreements. From this place we steered north, keeping still off the coast of China, till we were beyond all its ports where European ships usually come; and, at length, being come to the latitude of thirty degrees, we resolved to put into the first trading port we should come at; and standing for the shore, a boat came off two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot on board, who offered his service; we very gladly accepted him, and sent the boat back again. And now, having the man on board, I talked to him of going to Nanquin, the most northward part of the coast of China. What will you do there? said he, smiling. I told him that we would sell our cargo, and purchase calicoes, raw and wrought silks, tea, &c. and so return the same way back. O, said he, you had better put in at Macao, where you may buy China wares as cheap as at Nanquin, and sell your opium at a greater advance.

You may go to Nanquin if you please, and travel to Pekin, and there is a Dutch ship just before bound that way. At the name of a Dutch or English ship, I was struck with confusion; they being as great a terror to me in this vessel, as an Algerine man of war is to them in the Mediterranean.
