Euro-MPs were accosted by activists handing out a propaganda video accusing five European commissioners of corruptly colluding with big pharmaceutical firms {{in an attempt to}} destroy the alternative network of homeopathic and [...] "natural medicines", though it emerged that most homeopathic practice in the UK has been illegal for some years and proposed European regulatory changes do not materially affect this.|$|E

Proper management and handling practices require a reduction in produce temperature to maintain quality and market value. Produce cooling after harvest starts on the farm.

30|$|Implementing DRP, DT {{consumers}} {{shift their}} demands from peak periods to off-peak periods {{to reduce the}} cost of electricity bills. In this way, these consumers maintain the same level of their total energy consumption with paying less cost through shifting non-essential demands from peak periods to off-peak periods. It is most evident that DRP implementation increases the profit of <b>retailer</b> <b>and</b> decreases the cost paid by the end-use consumers; consequently, it can be interpreted as a win-win game for both the <b>retailer</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumers.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} use of below-cost pricing in {{downstream}} markets and examine their impact on social welfare {{as well as on}} supplier incentives to invest in quality. Considering a bilateral bargaining framework in the intermediate good market, we find that supplier’s bargaining position vis-à-vis the retailer decreases {{as a consequence of the}} ban which implies lower wholesale prices. Hence, both the <b>retailer</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumers</b> are better off under the ban, while the supplier loses. Furthermore, the supplier has stronger incentives to provide high quality under the ban, whereas their implications for social welfare are ambiguous...|$|R

40|$|Consumers {{frequently}} face mismatch risk as goods they purchase may {{be deemed}} inappropriate or below expectations. Due to this risk, consumers may avoid purchasing such goods <b>and</b> consequently hurt <b>retailers.</b> Can {{the emergence of}} peer-to-peer (P 2 P) marketplaces benefit retailers? On the one hand, P 2 P marketplaces can mitigate some of this risk by allowing consumers to trade mismatched goods. On the other hand, P 2 P marketplaces impose a threat on retailers as they compete with them over consumers. We develop a two-period model that highlights the effects introduced by P 2 P marketplaces. We show that a P 2 P marketplace benefits both the <b>retailer</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumers</b> when the wholesale price is sufficiently high and hurts them both when the wholesale price is low. The introduction of a P 2 P marketplace can relieve consumers from the mismatch risk <b>and</b> induces the <b>retailer</b> to post a higher price. However, when the wholesale price is low, the platform manages to extract most, or all, of the <b>consumers</b> surplus <b>and</b> directly hurts <b>consumers,</b> <b>and</b> eventually the <b>retailer</b> who experiences lower sales in both periods. With a high wholesale price the P 2 P marketplace is limited in its ability of extracting consumer surplus, which increases the <b>retailer</b> sales <b>and</b> benefits both the <b>retailer</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumers.</b> We further observe that social welfare is generally higher unless the wholesale price is relatively low...|$|R
