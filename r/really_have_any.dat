25|$|Weather {{along the}} route is typical of Connecticut. This trail does not <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> exposed ridge tops or summits. Snow is common {{in the winter and}} may necessitate the use of snowshoes. Ice can form on exposed ledges and summits, making hiking {{dangerous}} without special equipment.|$|E
25|$|Embrun {{also has}} an Industrial Park. Despite the name, the Industrial Park doesn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> industry, just semi-industrial {{commerce}} such as warehouses. The Ontario Provincial Police Station is also located here. The Industrial Park is located just {{to the north of}} the Embrun Business Park.|$|E

5000|$|In a starred review, Publishers Weekly {{describes}} [...] "I'm Feeling Lucky" [...] as: [...] "Affectionate, compulsively readable[...] [...] [...] This lively, thoughtful business memoir is {{more entertaining}} than it <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> right to be, {{and should be}} required reading for startup aficionados." ...|$|R
500|$|Writer Naren Shankar {{was happy}} with the overall episode, saying [...] "I think all the Viking scenes worked very well. The sets were magnificent-the forest set was beautiful, and I don't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> {{complaints}} about it. Everybody really outdid themselves on it." [...] Supervising producer David Livingston praised the prop and wardrobe departments for creating the array of [...] "cool-looking" [...] extras, while Michael Piller said that the whole episode was [...] "well produced". Taylor praised the premise, calling the idea [...] "irresistible" [...] and the overall episode [...] "delightful".|$|E
500|$|Markley and Lloyd {{did not get}} on, {{which led}} to the latter leaving the group and Morgan joining full-time. According to Lloyd, Markley became {{increasingly}} overbearing on the WCPAEB's creative output, and [...] "he started to believe that he was like, you know, the real deal, as opposed to the guy who doesn't sing and doesn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> musical thoughts and stuff like that. He wasn't content anymore just being the guy who ended up with the girls that he could get from it". Lloyd remained in Los Angeles and participated in a number of studio projects with Fowley and Mike Curb such as October Country, the Smoke, St. John Green, and the Fire Escape.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} Grand Theft Auto IV {{was written by}} Dan Houser and Rupert Humphries. Unlike {{previous}} Grand Theft Auto games which have a strong cultural or cinematic influence, [...] " [...] <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> cinematic influences", as explained by Houser. [...] "We were consciously trying to go, well, if video games are going to develop into the next stage, then the thing isn't {{to try and do}} a loving tribute or reference other stuff. It's to reference the actual place itself". Houser also said, [...] "In terms of the character, we wanted something that felt fresh and new and not something that was obviously derived from [...] movie. [...] Maybe [...] could do something ourselves that would live alongside that stuff".|$|E
5000|$|The {{band was}} formed in 1995. Cook said [...] "We never <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> {{intention}} of playing for the public, but a friend wanted to promote a couple of concerts. We got talked into it, but didn't know how it would go over." ...|$|R
50|$|During 2005 and 2006 Murph {{moved to}} Paul Weel Racing (PWR) where he {{initially}} had good results until changing to the Perkins engines.

50|$|With the town's major growth period {{around the}} early 20th century and Formby never <b>really</b> <b>having</b> <b>any</b> major industry, the road system {{followed}} an American style method of road building.

500|$|On February 13–15, 2009, Keenan debuted Puscifer at the Pearl Concert Theater in Palms Casino Resort in Paradise, Nevada, with a cabaret-style show so {{abstract}} it is {{not easily}} described. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Keenan stated [...] "we didn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> clue what to call it, so we just kind of called it cabaret." [...] Keenan—who has had previous experience with this type of entertainment, having fronted a similar show in Los Angeles before achieving fame with Tool—went on to add that [...] "you just can't really describe it, you just have to see it, then it makes sense." [...] Featuring an ever-changing lineup of artists including Milla Jovovich and Primus drummer Tim Alexander, the show was originally said to have a long-term residency at the Pearl; however, Keenan later revealed that it was to be only a two-show performance.|$|E
500|$|On 25 June 1967, the Beatles {{performed}} their forthcoming single, [...] "All You Need Is Love", to {{an estimated}} 350 million viewers on Our World, the first live global television link. Released a week later, during the Summer of Love, the song was adopted as a flower power anthem. Two months later, the group suffered a loss that threw their career into turmoil. Having been introduced to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi only the previous night in London, on 25 August they travelled to Bangor for his Transcendental Meditation retreat. Two days later, their manager's assistant, Peter Brown, phoned to inform them that Epstein, only thirty-two years old, had died. The coroner ruled the death an accidental carbitol overdose, although it was widely rumoured to be a suicide. Epstein {{had been in a}} fragile emotional state, stressed by personal issues. His death left the group disoriented and fearful about the future. Lennon recalled: [...] "We collapsed. I knew that we were in trouble then. I didn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and I was scared. I thought, 'We've had it now.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|DeLillo has {{subsequently}} expressed {{surprise at}} {{the success of the}} novel. In 2007, he candidly remarked: [...] "When I finished with Underworld, I didn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> all-too-great hopes, to be honest. It's some pretty complicated stuff: 800 pages, more than 100 different characters – who's going to be interested in that?" ...|$|E
50|$|That evening, Teeter and Weck are together. Teeter {{has made}} {{arrangements}} {{to have a}} house ready for the two, but he alternates between worshipping Weck and wondering whether she <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> interest in him at all. Upon returning home, Weck tries to sleep, but can't, and hears the arguments when Rex comes home.|$|R
50|$|According to Mayor Catáquiz, {{he never}} <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> {{intention}} {{at all to}} run for any public office. He was just prodded {{by the people of}} San Pedro, particularly former Mayor José L. Amante, to run against then incumbent Mayor Felicísimo Vierneza during the 30 January 1980 Philippine Elections. He lost during his first foray into Philippine politics.|$|R
5000|$|According to the CEO of a {{servicer}} of the securitization industry, Jim Callahan of PentAlpha, [...] "The {{rating agencies}} were important tools {{to do that}} because you know the people that we were selling these bonds to <b>had</b> never <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> history in the mortgage business. ... They were looking for an independent party to develop an opinion," ...|$|R
2500|$|Biologist Kevin Padian {{from the}} University of California, Berkeley, said {{people who had}} {{received}} copies were [...] "just astounded at its size and production values and equally astonished at what a load of crap it is."

2500|$|In 1994, Andy Chase and Dominique Durand met {{each other}} through an {{advertisement}} to record music together. Following the completion of several songs, the pair invited Adam Schlesinger to join them and form Ivy. Together they wrote and produced [...] "Get Enough", which was well received by the public, and released their debut extended play in the same year, titled Lately. While signed to Seed Records, they recorded Realistic, which was distributed in the United States in 1995. Shortly after its release, the label dropped Ivy, prompting Schlesinger to claim that [...] "Seed {{was kind of the}} worst of both worlds because it didn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> credibility and it didn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> money". Because of Schlesinger's involvement as a member of Fountains of Wayne, he had established a relationship with Atlantic Records and would eventually sign with them who provided funding for them to record a second studio album.|$|E
2500|$|Sykes {{has stated}} that the band was better focused when in the studio, which {{made it easier for}} them to {{experiment}} with song writing and to expand their sound: [...] "We didn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> other band we wanted to sound like or any other style. We just thought we'd try to do something different and see what comes out. And this is what came out." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Recording this I was thinking, 'Fucking hurry up, we don't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> money! Fucking {{give me that}} guitar, I'm {{doing this}} shit myself.' It was a crazy time, we were still kids and I never <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> plans, past making that record… I {{just wanted to make}} the best record we could then and live in that moment," [...] wiL Francis commented, {{speaking}} to Kerrang! in 2009.|$|R
2500|$|A {{legal team}} led by Julian Miles QC, media lawyer Steven Price, and {{barrister}} Felix Geiringer gathered round Nicky Hager, who is seeking a judicial review of the police action. Steven Price said [...] "Our case will be that the police didn't properly consider Nicky Hager's right to protect his confidential sources". Commenting on the case, law professor Ursula Cheer said: [...] "We've never <b>really</b> <b>had</b> {{a case like this}} before and we've never <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> of these (public interest) issues tested." ...|$|R
2500|$|While noise rock <b>has</b> never <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> {{mainstream}} popularity, the raw, distorted and feedback-intensive {{sound of}} some noise rock bands had {{an influence on}} grunge. Among them are Wisconsin's Killdozer, and most notably San Francisco's Flipper, a band known for its slowed-down and murky [...] "noise punk". The Butthole Surfers' mix of punk, heavy metal and noise rock was a major influence, particularly on the early work of Soundgarden.|$|R
2500|$|Due {{to having}} Portuguese {{heritage}} through his paternal grandfather, Gameiro was eligible to represent Portugal {{at the senior}} international level. In 2009, then-manager Carlos Queiroz declared that Gameiro was [...] "an interesting player" [...] and that he [...] "would love to talk to him" [...] regarding representing Portugal. However, Gameiro downplayed the talk, stating that he [...] "didn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> links to the country" [...] and that he preferred to represent France.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{conversation}} with a childhood friend, Father Pirrone enters a lengthy speech explaining why the Prince and other aristocrats don't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> reaction {{one way or the other}} to the events of the revolution. - They [...] "live in a world of their own ... all they live by has been handled by others". He concludes by saying that the feelings and attitudes that give rise to class consciousness never truly die.|$|E
2500|$|Ross sound almost tearful, in fact, when he professes {{his faith}} that the Potter {{phenomenon}} will outlast Deathly Hallows. He and his brother have both been in bands where, “if you go four hours away from your hometown, nobody comes to see you.” When the wiz kid is involved, they have a built-in fan base wherever they go. “Our experience with wizard rock {{has been the best}} musical experience of our lives,” says Ross. “We don’t <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> interest in stopping at all.” ...|$|E
50|$|Philip Hutchinson (born 25 January 1862 in West Dean, England, died 30 September 1925 in Durban, Natal) was a South African cricketer {{who played}} in two Tests in South Africa in 1889. He never <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> impact in the two matches he played. His side (South Africa) were beaten in his first match by 8 wickets and by 202 runs in his second and final match of {{international}} cricket.|$|R
60|$|Her answer puzzled me. If Felicia <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> idea as to {{the nature}} of it, and was content to play the part she was playing, it {{certainly}} could not be anything of an illicit nature. Yet everything else which had come under my notice pointed to Delora's being associated with a criminal undertaking. I paced the room, deep in thought. Felicia all the time was watching me anxiously.|$|R
5000|$|Beyond Hollywood wrote [...] "the {{movie is}} much better than it <b>really</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> right to be", and that as both writer and director, Trace Slobotkin [...] "oftentimes manages to ascend beyond the {{constraints}} of the movie." [...] They note that the film is not without its issues, and that the background issue of there being a real serial killer at work does not begin to make its impact until after the first 20 minutes.|$|R
2500|$|That {{was written}} {{around the time}} of the first record [...] I think that was the second thing Ed and I wrote together. It came out of a jam in the studio and Ed didn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> lyrics. He came up with some ideas right there on the spot, and that's what we recorded. For some reason, it didn't make it on Ten. I was kind of bummed at the time. I really wanted it to be on our first record. But at the time, I was really young and just happy to be around this situation, so I did whatever.|$|E
2500|$|Bryant {{sold the}} Copping farm for $143,000 {{and kept the}} Hobart mansion. While living at Copping, the white {{overalls}} he habitually wore were replaced with clothing {{more in line with}} Harvey's financial status. Now that he was alone, his dress became more bizarre. He often wore a grey linen suit, cravat, lizard skin shoes and a Panama hat while carrying a briefcase during the day, telling anyone who would listen that he had a well-paying career. He often wore an electric blue suit with flared trousers and a ruffled shirt to the restaurant he frequented. The restaurant owner recalled: [...] "It was horrible. Everyone was laughing at him, even the customers. I really felt suddenly quite sorry for him. I realised this guy didn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Episode six: Mark and Jo - When Woodall and Constantine meet Mark and Jo, {{they see}} a couple who could be [...] "father and daughter". Jo has already {{undergone}} a transformation, dropping five dress sizes through hard exercise. She feels ready to take pride in her appearance, but she needs the support of Mark. Her husband has no ambition with clothing and does not think of his appearance at all important, only wearing football tops. Jo wants to revamp her wardrobe but does not <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> knowledge about what clothing is suitable, and resorts to buying her clothes from magazines and only ventures to wear black. After Woodall and Constantine have taken them shopping for new clothing, Mark is improved when dressed in earthy tones which complement his skin tone. Jo sees her complexion brightened by the substitution of black to shades of copper, blue and red.|$|E
50|$|American Presbyterians {{first became}} aware of Higher Criticism (the Historical-Critical method) as a {{development}} of the German academy. Between 1829 and 1850, the Princeton Review, the leading Old School theological journal under the editorship of Charles Hodge published 70 articles against higher criticism, and the number increased {{in the years after}} 1850. However, {{it was not until the}} years after 1880 that Higher Criticism <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> advocates within American seminaries. When Higher Criticism arrived, it arrived in force.|$|R
50|$|Much of the band's songwriting {{material}} {{in this era}} also came from the members' own experiences traveling through the country in near-constant tours over the previous several years, {{as well as an}} increasing sense of political activism which would find expression on subsequent albums Lifes Rich Pageant and Document. Stipe later said that his previous lyrics never <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> literal meanings, and that by this time he had begun to write lyrics that told stories.|$|R

It's a loss, my dear lady, an irretrievable loss, to the operatic stage! Do you know, when I think what that grand creature might have done, I sometimes ask myself if I <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> right to marry her.
