50|$|Aviation English is {{the highly}} {{specialized}} language and sequences used by pilots, air traffic control, and other aviation personnel and {{it focuses on}} a particular pronunciation, vocabulary, grammatical structure, and discourse styles {{that are used in}} specific aviation-related contexts. The language used by pilots and air traffic controllers during <b>radiotelephony</b> <b>communication</b> can be categorized into two types: standard phraseology, and plain language repertoire. Standard phraseology is the specialized phrasing commonly used by the aviation community to effectively communicate, and plain language is a more normal language used in everyday life.|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the issue of {{integrative}} approach to language training of air traffic controllers in air traffic control simulator. The integrative approach is viewed in terms of two elements of English communicative competency: oral speech skills (listening comprehension and speaking) and language of <b>radiotelephony</b> <b>communication</b> (radiotelephony phraseology and plain English in aviation context). </p...|$|E
40|$|In 2003 the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) {{strengthened}} the provisions that English {{be made available}} for international <b>radiotelephony</b> <b>communication.</b> ICAO also developed standards for English proficiency for international pilots and air traffic controllers. However, these standards are applied variably {{from country to country}} and in no country are native speakers of English tested for their ability to employ what has been termed "interactional competence" when using English for intercultural communication. Problems with this situation are reviewed and suggestions made for improving English assessment and training...|$|E
5000|$|... 2182 kHz is the {{international}} calling and distress frequency for SSB maritime voice <b>communication</b> (<b>radiotelephony).</b> It is analogous to Channel 16 on the marine VHF band. 500 kHz was for many years the maritime distress and emergency frequency, {{and there are more}} NDBs between 510 and 530 kHz. Navtex, {{which is part of the}} current Global Maritime Distress Safety System occupies 518 kHz and 490 kHz for important digital text broadcasts. Lastly, there are aeronautical and other mobile SSB bands from 2850 kHz to 3500 kHz, crossing the boundary from the MF band into the HF radio band.|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{exploring}} {{the use of}} language use in <b>radiotelephony</b> <b>communication</b> have {{tended to focus on}} the limitations of the non-native English user and the threats which their limited control of English may pose for aviation safety (e. g. Atsushi, 2003, 2004). Hence the recent International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) policy places the onus on non-native users to bring their English to an appropriate standard. The present paper argues {{that there is a need}} for a broader perspective on this issue and supports this case with reference to two sources of data: a) episodes of radiotelephony discourse recorded in two air traffic control centres in Korea exemplifying non-routine, abnormal and emergency situations involving NS of English and NNS from different language backgrounds, b) focus group and individual interviews with selected Korean aviation personnel eliciting their interpretations of these episodes and of issues in aviation English more generally. Findings suggest that responsibilities for communication problems in aviation English are distributed across NS and NNS users, and may be partly due to the absence of shared assumptions about efficient and appropriate communication practices in an environment where English is a lingua franca (ELF). Implications are drawn for the communication training of all aviation personnel, regardless of language background...|$|E
