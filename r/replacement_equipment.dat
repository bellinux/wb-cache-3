5|$|Rather than {{wait for}} <b>replacement</b> <b>equipment,</b> Barnette {{purchased}} {{the press of}} a newly arrived editor, William Fentress Thompson, who had intended to set up his own newspaper. As part of the purchasing deal in August 1906, Thompson was allowed to publish an evening paper—the Tanana Daily Miner—while the Fairbanks Daily News {{was published in the}} morning. The deal lasted only through September, as Thompson and Barnette conflicted on a personal level. The Tanana Miner was reduced to a weekly newspaper, then Thompson was deposed as editor of the Fairbanks News in June 1907 and took the Tanana Miner to the settlement of Chena, outside Fairbanks. Barnette, meanwhile, became embroiled in a series of legal troubles. He faced opposition from the owner of the Fairbanks Times, A.L. Anderson, who had fought Barnette about several gold claims near Fairbanks and purchased the Times to compete against Barnette.|$|E

25|$|Companies A, B, C, and D – {{the tank}} line companies, both medium and light, all {{followed}} the same table of organization. Each company consisted of a headquarters section which, along with a small headquarters staff, also included two tanks (one for the company commander {{and one for the}} executive officer); and three five-tank platoons. The medium tank companies were equipped with M4 Sherman tanks, while the light tank company was equipped with M5 Stuart tanks. All four companies had their own maintenance section, which included an M32 Tank Recovery Vehicle, built on a Sherman chassis. Because the Stuart carried a 4-man crew versus a 5-man crew on the Sherman, it had a somewhat smaller personnel strength than the medium tank companies. For the Normandy landings, Companies B and C were equipped with DD tanks. As virtually all these tanks were lost during the assault on D-Day, they were replaced with conventional M4 Shermans as soon as the battalion began receiving <b>replacement</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E

50|$|As furnace {{efficiency}} gets higher, appropriate matching {{of equipment}} size to distribution system capacity and building load becomes more critical to optimizing equipment ability to maximize efficient operation.

40|$|This {{paper will}} present a model of <b>equipment</b> <b>replacement</b> in a {{stochastic}} environment utilizing {{a number of the}} component characteristics of an operations research orientation while being designed to emphasize the role of a stochastic representation of technological change and/or maintenance costs and the implications these have for the decision about <b>replacement</b> of <b>equipment.</b> The "replacement" referred to here is replacement of a machine in its entirety rather than the usual periodic-review-replacement-of-individual-pieces analysis to which the term "replacement" frequently refers in operations research literature. The paper outlines the approaches to <b>equipment</b> <b>replacement</b> in the literature of economics and the well-known Terborgh model and then introduces a stochastic model for studying certain aspects of <b>equipment</b> <b>replacement</b> together with the form of its analytic solution. A comparison of the cost implications of the Terborgh and stochastic model is presented for a specific example utilizing motor vehicle data. In addition, a general analytic comparison of the two replacement rules is provided. ...|$|R
