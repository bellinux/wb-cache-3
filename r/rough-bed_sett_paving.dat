500|$|On 14 December 2012, the ASO {{announced}} that the English historic county of Yorkshire would host the 2014 edition's early race stages (known as the Grand Départ). Further details {{of the first three}} stages held in the United Kingdom were released on 17 January 2014. This was the fourth Tour to contain stages in the United Kingdom, after 1974, 1994 and 2007. The entire route was announced by the ASO on 23 October 2013 at the official presentation at the Palais des Congrès in Paris. At the event, Stephen Roche, winner of the 1987 Tour, described the route as [...] "fairly soft". Notable features of the route were fifth stage's sections of <b>sett</b> <b>paving,</b> the five high altitude stage finishes and the lack time trialling, with only stage twenty's [...] individual time trial.|$|R
50|$|There were 21 {{stages in}} the race, {{covering}} a total distance of 3660.5 km. The longest mass-start stage was the seventh at 234.5 km, and stage 17 was the shortest at 124.5 km. Nine stages were officially classified as flat, five as medium mountain and six as high mountain. Stage five, although classified as medium mountain, was flat with <b>sett</b> <b>paving</b> sections. There were five summit finishes: stage 10, to La Planche des Belles Filles; stage 13, to Chamrousse; stage 14, to Risoul; stage 17, to Saint-Lary Pla d’Adet; and stage 18, to Hautacam. The highest point of the race was the 2360 m-high Col d'Izoard mountain pass on stage 14. There were nine new stage start or finish locations. The rest days were after stage 10, in the Besançon, and after 15, in Carcassonne.|$|R

25|$|The {{effect of}} motor bus tyres (which {{at that time}} were solid rubber) on the road surface was an early issue. Reimbursement for {{repairing}} {{the damage to the}} roads in Holyrood Park by the tour charabancs was laid down as a condition of operating there in the 1921 season. In 1921 the city deputy surveyor found that no undue damage was being done by buses on tarmacked roads, with some not damaged at all, but water-bound macadam surfaces and <b>sett</b> <b>paving</b> without concrete underlay were vulnerable to rutting and other issues. On one hilly route, after residents complained of vibration caused by the buses, various remedies were deployed - limiting the speed to 8mph, descent in gear, and the fitting of super-cushion tyres (Dunlop and North British). The 8mph limit was also necessary in granite paved sections of running, which were extensive in Edinburgh.|$|R

Među sačuvanim popločenjima, pločnik izveden šezdesetih godina XVIII. stoljeća u dvorištu palače Garagnin-Fanfogna, reprezentativan je primjer umjetničke i tehničke izvrsnosti kojom su majstori rješavali problem odvodnje na nepravilno oblikovanim površinama trogirskih dvorišta i ulica. The author {{presents}} {{different types}} of historic street pavement in Trogir and its neighboring municipalities. A short view of the past begins with the ancient pavement of the city 2 ̆ 7 s core, found in excavations, then moves onto the <b>sett</b> <b>paving</b> technique of medieval era which, with some alterations, survives well into {{the first half of}} the 20 th century, when industrially shaped paving slabs are introduced. Stone pavement technique changes little throughout history, mostly in the thickness and size of stone blocks which are laid onto the bedding layer of coarse grit sand, with or without joint mortar. A few examples of surviving historic pavements are described and analyzed. Amongst these, a well documented and preserved paving executed in the courtyard of the Garagnin-Fanfogna Palace in Trogir by Ignacije Macanović in the 1760 s is exemplary of the skill and artistry with which master masons solved the problem of drainage. Streets of the surrounding settlements of Trogir were generally not paved, but traces of historic pavements are found within enclosed open spaces of courtyards...|$|R
