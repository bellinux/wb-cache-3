40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the compliance with and {{the implementation of}} a standardized protocol for rehabilitation of patients with symptomatic joint surface defects on the femoral condyles and treated with in vivo cartilage forming cells in an ACI procedure or microfracture. METHODS: A total of 95 physiotherapists received instructions for implementing and <b>reporting</b> <b>on</b> a specific standardized rehabilitation protocol. The protocol describes the progress by goals and restrictions. Modalities to use and exercise parameters such as intensity, duration and frequency were not strictly imposed. The reporting rate was examined over a post-operative period of 3 months. The rehabilitation content was analysed for physiotherapists <b>reporting</b> <b>on</b> a <b>weekly</b> basis. 18 variables were defined including clinical examination, exercises, mobilisation modalities, electrotherapy and thermotherapy. RESULTS: 65 physiotherapists <b>reported</b> <b>on</b> a <b>weekly</b> basis. The average number of physiotherapy sessions a week was 3, 1 for the microfracture group and 3, 6 for the in vivo cartilage producing procedure group. For both groups the physiotherapists reported the application of 4 modalities per session. Overall the modalities used for both treatment groups were not significantly different over 12 weeks. However within specific weeks minor differences for time spent on gait reeducation, manual soft tissue mobilisation and active mobilisation exercises were observed. In general the protocol was well implemented in both groups. CONCLUSION: Overall, the standard rehabilitation protocol was implemented in a similar fashion in both treatment arms and the physiotherapists followed the protocol with an excellent compliance. This may suggest that the post operative physiotherapy is most probably not responsible for possible differences between the two cartilage repair techniques. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In 1983 the {{sentinel}} laboratory {{network was}} established {{because of the}} need to describe the epidemiological evolution of infectious diseases. During the study period of 30 years (1983 - 2013), microbiology laboratories <b>reported</b> <b>on</b> <b>weekly</b> basis the laboratory diagnosed cases for a selection of infectious diseases. This resulted in a large longitudinal laboratory based database allowing to provide trends over time and distribution by person and place. During this period, adaptations to data collection were made due to changes in diagnostic methods and public health priorities, introduction and application of digital revolution, and multiple reorganizations of the laboratories. Since the surveillance network is dynamic, it necessitates a continuous evaluation to ensure that, over time, it continues to be representative of the general epidemiological trends in the country. Secondly the aim is to examine the robustness and stability of this surveillance system. Here we demonstrated that the flexibility of the data collection methodology by the sentinel laboratory network is unique and that adaptations do not affect the capacity of the system to follow trends. Therefore, the surveillance by this network is representative of the current epidemiological situation in Belgium. To our knowledge, no such surveillance network with such a long-term follow-up and demonstrated stability for multiple infectious diseases in the general population was earlier described. Furthermore, expected trends due to the implementation of vaccination or other events were accurately detected. The collected data obtained from this network allows interesting comparisons with other national and international information sources. 0 SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

The 2003 salmon fishing season marked the second season of an organized effort to collect qualitative inseason subsistence harvest information. Information gauging progress towards subsistence salmon harvest goals, subsistence fishing characteristics, and quality of subsistence catch were collected. Progress towards meeting subsistence harvest goals was evaluated by using local village interviewers contacting a subsample of fishermen each week. Residents of Emmonak, Holy Cross, Nulato, Huslia, Galena, and Circle were interviewed weekly between June 1 and August 31, 2003. Sixty-three households were interviewed regarding Chinook salmon harvests and seventeen households were interviewed regarding chum salmon harvest progression. Information was <b>reported</b> <b>on</b> fourteen <b>weekly</b> public teleconferences and used in nine Federal inseason management summaries.

40|$|This study {{tested a}} {{bayesian}} model {{based on a}} conjugate gamma/Poisson pair associated to geophysical variables derived from remote sensing (sea surface temperature in form of gradients, chlorophyll-a concentration, zonal and meridional wind speed, and Ekman pumping) to produce <b>weekly</b> <b>catch</b> estimates of the skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) in the South Brazil Bight.

The catch data has been divided in two series, called historical series (1996 - 2001), and model validation year (2002).

40|$|A good {{understanding}} of the constraints on agricultural growth in Africa relies on the accurate measurement of smallholder labor. Yet, serious weaknesses in these statistics persist. The extent of bias in smallholder labor data is examined by conducting a randomized survey experiment among farming households in rural Tanzania. Agricultural labor estimates obtained through weekly surveys are compared {{with the results of}} reporting in a single end-of-season recall survey. The findings show strong evidence of recall bias: people in traditional recall-style modules report working up to four times as many hours per person-plot relative to those <b>reporting</b> labor <b>on</b> a <b>weekly</b> basis. If hours are aggregated to the household level, however, this discrepancy disappears, a factor driven by the underreporting by recall households of people and plots active in agricultural work.

40|$|Background: Childhood {{sexual abuse}} (CSA) has the {{potential}} to compromise socio-emotional development of the survivor resulting in increased vulnerability to difficulties regulating emotions. In turn, emotion regulation is thought to play a key part in a number of psychological disorders which CSA survivors are at increased risk of developing. A better understanding of the basic emotions experienced in this population and emotion regulation strategies will inform current treatment. Objective: This paper examines the relationships between type of emotions experienced, emotion regulation strategies, and psychological trauma symptoms in a sample of survivors of CSA. Method: A consecutive case series of CSA survivors (n= 109) completed the Basic Emotions Scale (BES) —Weekly, General, and Coping versions; the Regulation of Emotions Questionnaire; the Post-traumatic Stress Checklist—Civilian Version (PCL-C); and the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure. Results: Significantly higher levels of disgust than other levels of emotions were <b>reported</b> <b>on</b> the <b>weekly</b> version of the BES. In addition, significantly higher levels of disgust and lower levels of happiness were <b>reported</b> <b>on</b> the BES—General subscale. Regression analyses revealed that sadness, fear, disgust, and external dysfunctional coping strategies predicted global post-traumatic stress disorder and re-experiencing symptomatology measured by the PCL-C. Global distress, as measured by CORE, was predicted by the emotions of sadness, disgust, and low happiness, as well as dysfunctional regulatory strategies. In addition, preliminary exploratory factor analyses supported the structure of all three versions of the BES, with disgust explaining the largest percentage of variance, followed by happiness. Conclusions: The findings highlight the utility of profiling basic emotions in understanding the strong associations between emotional phenomena, particularly the emotion of disgust and psychopathology in CSA survivors...|$|R
