5|$|Nations and {{international}} businesses face {{an array of}} financial risks unique to foreign investment activity. Political risk {{is the potential for}} losses from a foreign country's political instability or otherwise unfavorable developments, which manifests in different forms. Transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country's capital controls and balance of payments. Operational risk characterizes concerns over a country's <b>regulatory</b> <b>policies</b> and their impact on normal business operations. Control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments. Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to expropriate or nationalize foreign-held assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investor's decision to acquire assets in the host country. Country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk, and represents the potential for unanticipated developments in a host country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends.|$|E

Moreover, the industry was on the threshold of increasing globalization, and required radical shifts in <b>regulatory</b> <b>policies</b> in order to comply with global standards.|$|E

25|$|In the United States {{the term}} {{liberalism}} has become {{associated with the}} welfare state and expanded <b>regulatory</b> <b>policies</b> created {{as a result of}} the New Deal and its offshoots from the 1930s onwards. Fiscal conservatives form one of the three legs of the traditional conservative movement in the United States, together with social conservatism and national defense conservatism. Many Americans who are classical liberals also tend to identify as Libertarian, holding more socially liberal views and advocating a non-interventionist foreign policy while supporting lower taxes and less government spending.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{expansion}} of the welfare state and increased <b>regulatory</b> <b>policies</b> by the Roosevelt administration beginning in the 1930s, the term liberalism in the United States today has become associated with modern rather than classical liberalism. In Western Europe, however, the expanded welfare states created after the Second World War were created by socialist or social democratic parties such as the British Labour Party rather than liberal parties. As a result, many liberal parties in Western Europe tend to adhere to classical liberalism, the Free Democratic Party in Germany being one example. The Liberal Democrats in the UK have a classical and a social liberal wing of the party. In many countries liberalism or neoliberalism is used to describe what Americans call fiscal conservatism.|$|E

[...] It passed the House on February 13, 2013 {{by a vote of}} 422-0. [...] The act was intended to change some of the regulations in the United States surrounding hydropower by making it easier for smaller hydropower stations to be created. [...] According to the bill's proponents, current regulations are unwieldy and represent a significant hurdle to creating more hydropower plants. [...] H.R. 267 would alter those regulations {{to make it easier for}} smaller plants to get approval quickly. [...] The legislation also requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to study how to further improve the regulatory process. [...] H.R. 267 would amend the Public Utility <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Policies</b> Act of 1978 (PURPA) and the Federal Power Act. [...] Currently, hydropower projects the produce 5,000 kilowatts or less of power can avoid having to get certain licenses. [...] H.R. 267 would raise that amount to 10,000 kilowatts, facilitating the speed at which smaller hydropower projects could be built. [...] The existing rules mean that it takes about five years for hydropower projects to get approval, according to hydropower industry sources.|$|E
