2500|$|Due in part {{to public}} discontent and {{in part to}} a {{campaign}} for re-examination by Vette himself, a Royal Commission of Inquiry was formed on 7 July 1980 to examine the TAIC's finding of pilot error. Vette's research, along with other evidence, was presented to High Court Judge Peter Mahon, {{who was in charge of}} the commission. Vette served as an adviser to Mahon during the proceedings, and his findings proved especially influential. Justice Mahon even took a helicopter ride to Mt. Erebus during the course of his investigation to experience the phenomenon of sector whiteout for himself. As he later described it, [...] "I was taken for a flight myself in white out conditions and saw with my own eyes the flat terrain of ice and snow stretching forth for more than forty miles when in fact <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> there was a snow ridge several hundred feet high". Mahon's final report was published on 27 April 1981, and it largely agreed with Vette's hypotheses. Mahon found Air New Zealand to be financially responsible, describing their attempts to shift the blame on to the late flight crew as [...] "very clearly part of an attempt to conceal a series of disastrous administrative blunders". ANZ appealed the ruling to the New Zealand Court of Appeal, and, although the financial penalties were ultimately removed, the court declined to overturn any of Mahon's factual findings.|$|E
60|$|About {{nine o'clock}} the light {{among the trees}} was extinguished, and all was dark in the {{direction}} of the Manor House.

60|$|At {{the end of}} {{the valley}} the road curved over some rising ground before winding down into another wider valley beyond. We called a halt when we came to the top; for there, <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> at the {{distance}} of about three miles, was a scattered, grey town, with a single enormous building upon the flank of the mountain which overlooked it. We could not doubt that we were at last in sight of the Abbey that held the gang of rascals whom we had come to disperse. It was only now, I think, that we fully understood what a task lay in front of us, for the place was a veritable fortress, and it was evident that cavalry should never have been sent out upon such an errand.|$|E
60|$|The track {{which led}} to the Castle wound through a pitch-black fir-wood, where we could see nothing save the ragged patch of stars above our heads. Presently, however, it opened up, and there was the Castle <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> about as far as a carbine would carry. It was a huge, uncouth place, and bore every mark of being {{exceedingly}} old, with turrets at every corner, and a square keep on the side which was nearest to us. In all its great shadow {{there was no sign of}} light save from a single window, and no sound came from it. To me there was something awful in its size and its silence, which corresponded so well with its sinister name. My companion pressed on eagerly, and I followed him along the ill-kept path {{which led to}} the gate.|$|E
60|$|Leaving the ill-omened {{farmhouse}} {{behind us}} {{we set off}} with all military precautions, Marot riding with me some distance in front, while two of the troopers covered the rear. It was still very dark, though a thin grey line on the horizon showed that the dawn was not far off. In spite of the gloom, however, our new acquaintance guided us without a moment's halt or hesitation through a network of lanes and bypaths, across fields and over bogs, where the waggons were sometimes up to their axles in bog, and sometimes were groaning and straining over rocks and stones. So frequent were our turnings, and so often did we change the direction of our advance, that I feared more than once that our guide was at fault; yet, when at last the first {{rays of the sun}} brightened the landscape we saw the steeple of Bridgewater parish church shooting up <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E

"Well, 'twas my fust, you see, so I aint {{ashamed to}} say I was a trifle flustered in the beginnin', there was such an allfired racket; for ef there's {{anything}} I do spleen agin, it's noise. But when my mate, Eph Sylvester, caved, with a bullet through his head, I got mad, and pitched in, licketty cut. Our part of the fight didn't last long; {{so a lot of}} us larked round Fredericksburg, and give some of them houses a pretty consid'able of a rummage, till we was ordered out of the mess. Some of our fellows cut like time; but I warn't a-goin' to run for nobody; and, fust thing I knew, a shell bust, <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> and I keeled over, feelin' as if I was blowed higher'n a kite.

60|$|So far I had not {{dared to}} look out, but now I gently parted the {{division}} of the curtains {{in front of me and}} peeped through. From the pressure of Holmes's shoulder against mine, I knew that he was sharing my observations. <b>Right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> and almost within our reach, was the broad, rounded back of Milverton. It was evident that we had entirely miscalculated his movements, that he had never been to his bedroom, but that he had been sitting up in some smoking or billiard room in the farther wing of the house, the windows of which we had not seen. His broad, grizzled head, with its shining patch of baldness, was in the immediate foreground of our vision. He was leaning far back in the red leather chair, his legs outstretched, a long, black cigar projecting at an angle from his mouth. He wore a semi-military smoking jacket, claret-coloured, with a black velvet collar. In his hand he held a long, legal document which he was reading in an indolent fashion, blowing rings of tobacco smoke from his lips as he did so. There was no promise of a speedy departure in his composed bearing and his comfortable attitude.|$|E
60|$|I {{could see}} by {{the dim light}} of the single torch which Murgatroyd held upon the margin, that the roof of the cave sloped sheer down upon us as we sculled slowly out towards the entrance. So low did it come at last that there was only a space of a few feet between it and the water, and we had to bend our heads to avoid the rocks above us. The boatmen gave two strong strokes, and we shot out from under the {{overhanging}} ledge, and found ourselves in the open with the stars shining murkily above us, and the moon showing herself dimly and cloudily through a gathering haze. <b>Right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> was a dark blur, which, as we pulled towards it, took the outline of a large lugger rising and falling with the pulse of the sea. Her tall thin spars and delicate network of cordage towered above us as we glided under the counter, while the creaking of blocks and rattle of ropes showed that she was all ready to glide off upon her journey. Lightly and daintily she rode upon the waters, like some giant seafowl, spreading one white pinion after another in preparation for her flight. The boatmen ran us alongside and steadied the dinghy while I climbed over the bulwarks on to the deck.|$|E

6000|$|I {{shall never}} forget--I suppose no woman ever does--the evening when John first spoke out {{his love for}} me. I had felt for some time past that it was there. Again and again, he seemed about to speak. But somehow his words seemed to fail him. Twice I took him into {{the very heart of}} the little wood beside Mother's house, but it was only a small wood, and somehow he slipped out on the other side. [...] "Oh, John," [...] I had said, [...] "how lonely and still it seems in the wood with no one here but ourselves! Do you think," [...] I said, [...] "that the birds have souls?" [...] "I don't know," [...] John answered, [...] "let's get out of this." [...] I was sure that his emotion was too strong for him. [...] "I never feel a bit lonesome where you are, John," [...] I said, as we made our way among the underbrush. [...] "I think we can get out down that little gully," [...] he answered. Then one evening in June after tea I led John down a path beside the house to a little corner behind the garden where there was a stone wall on one side and a high fence <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> and thorn bushes on the other side. There was a little bench in the angle of the wall and the fence, and we sat down on it.|$|E
6000|$|It was at {{this time}} of the fight that we saw two single fights, which they tell me were common enough in the battles of old, before men were trained in masses. As we lay in the hollow two {{horsemen}} came spurring along the ridge <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> riding as hard as hoof could rattle. The first was an English dragoon, his face right down on his horse's mane, with a French cuirassier, an old, grey-headed fellow, thundering behind him, on a big black mare. Our chaps set up a hooting as they came flying on, for it seemed shame to see an Englishman run like that; but as they swept across our front we saw where the trouble lay. The dragoon had dropped his sword, and was unarmed, while the other was pressing him so close that he could not get a weapon. At last, stung maybe by our hooting, he made up his mind to chance it. His eye fell on a lance beside a dead Frenchman, so he swerved his horse to let the other pass, and hopping off cleverly enough, he gripped hold of it. But the other was too tricky for him, and was on him like a shot. The dragoon thrust up with the lance, but the other turned it, and sliced him through the shoulder-blade. [...] It was all done in an instant, and the Frenchman cantering his horse up the brae, showing his teeth at us over his shoulder like a snarling dog.|$|E
6000|$|A gentle, old-maidish {{person and}} a sweet young girl of {{seventeen}} sat <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{that night at the}} Mannheim opera. These people talked, between the acts, and I understood them, though I understood nothing that was uttered on the distant stage. At first they were guarded in their talk, but after they had heard my agent and me conversing in English they dropped their reserve and I picked up many of their little confidences; no, I mean many of HER little confidences--meaning the elder party--for the young girl only listened, and gave assenting nods, but never said a word. How pretty she was, and how sweet she was! I wished she would speak. But evidently she was absorbed in her own thoughts, her own young-girl dreams, and found a dearer pleasure in silence. But she was not dreaming sleepy dreams--no, she was awake, alive, alert, she could not sit still a moment. She was an enchanting study. Her gown was of a soft white silky stuff that clung to her round young figure like a fish's skin, and it was rippled over with the gracefulest little fringy films of lace; she had deep, tender eyes, with long, curved lashes; and she had peachy cheeks, and a dimpled chin, and such a dear little rosebud of a mouth; and she was so dovelike, so pure, and so gracious, so sweet and so bewitching. For long hours I did mightily wish she would speak. And at last she did; the red lips parted, and out leaps her thought--and with such a guileless and pretty enthusiasm, too: [...] "Auntie, I just KNOW I've got five hundred fleas on me!" ...|$|E

60|$|On {{the brow}} of this precipice stood a great {{building}} of the same granite that formed the cliff, built on three sides of a square, the fourth side being open, save {{for a kind of}} battlement pierced at its base by a little door. This imposing place we afterwards discovered was the palace of the queen, or rather of the queens. At the back of the palace the town sloped gently upwards to a flashing building of white marble, crowned by the golden dome which we had already observed. The city was, with the exception of this one building, entirely built of red granite, and laid out in regular blocks with splendid roadways between. So far as we could see also the houses were all one-storied and detached, with gardens round them, which gave some relief to the eye wearied with the vista of red granite. At the back of the palace a road of extraordinary width stretched away up the hill for a distance of {{a mile and a half}} or so, and appeared to terminate at an open space surrounding the gleaming building that crowned the hill. But <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> was the wonder and glory of Milosis -- the great staircase of the palace, the magnificence of which took our breath away. Let the reader imagine, if he can, a splendid stairway, sixty-five feet from balustrade to balustrade, consisting of two vast flights, each of one hundred and twenty-five steps of eight inches in height by three feet broad, connected by a flat resting-place sixty feet in length, and running from the palace wall on the edge of the precipice down to meet a waterway or canal cut to its foot from the river. This marvellous staircase was supported upon a single enormous granite arch, of which the resting-place between the two flights formed the crown; that is, the connecting open space lay upon it. From this archway sprang a subsidiary flying arch, or rather something that resembled a flying arch in shape, such as none of us had seen in any other country, and of which the beauty and wonder surpassed all that we had ever imagined. Three hundred feet from point to point, and no less than five hundred and fifty round the curve, that half-arc soared touching the bridge it supported for a space of fifty feet only, one end resting on and built into the parent archway, and the other embedded in the solid granite of the side of the precipice.|$|E
