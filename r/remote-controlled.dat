5|$|Arriving in Thunderbird 2, Virgil deploys three Elevator Cars, two {{of which}} will be <b>remote-{{controlled}}</b> from his master vehicle. Fireflash will be guided into a controlled landing on top of the cars, touching down with its undercarriage raised. Virgil and the Elevator Cars rush to intercept the inbound Fireflash on Runway 29, but when one of the <b>remote-controlled</b> cars malfunctions and crashes into a Boeing 727, which explodes twice on impact, the rescue attempt is aborted and the operation suspended while Virgil activates a reserve car. Fireflash starts a second run and successfully makes contact with all three vehicles. Applying brakes, Virgil loses control of the master car, which crashes into a trench; he is uninjured, however, and Fireflash comes to a halt before reaching the end of the runway. The bomb is dislodged from its original position but ultimately fails to explode.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday, 31 December, {{fighting}} {{began in}} the thick mango forests near Helashid, 11 miles (18km) to the northwest of Jilib. Ethiopian MiG fighters, tanks, artillery and mortars struck Islamic positions in the assault. Residents reported the road to Jilib was littered with <b>remote-controlled</b> landmines by the ICU. TFG and Ethiopian forces also attacked Bulobaley, with mortars and rockets.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, safety {{regulations}} for the project were scrutinized and revised. A special committee was established to review any similar experiments and recommend appropriate safety procedures. This change of procedures included needing a minimum of two people involved in such an experiment, using at least two instruments monitoring neutron intensities with audible alerts, and preparing a plan for operating methods and any contingencies that might occur during similar experiments. Additionally, discussions and designs for <b>remote-controlled</b> test devices were initiated, eventually leading {{to the creation of the}} Godiva device.|$|E
5|$|At bedtime on Christmas Eve, {{the family}} makes last-minute {{preparations}} at home, Marge tells everyone {{that no one}} can open presents until 7 AM and confiscates all of the alarm clocks. However, Bart drinks 12 glasses of water to wake up early and secretly unwraps his gifts, one of which is a <b>remote-controlled</b> fire truck. Bart plays with it until it sprays water on an overloaded electrical socket, causing a fire that engulfs and melts the plastic Christmas tree and all of the presents beneath it. Bart hides the evidence outside beneath the snow in the front yard.|$|E
5|$|It {{states that}} {{the theory of the}} Arab hijackers was created by the CIA, and that these Arabs may not even have been aware that the planes were going to crash. Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been <b>remote-controlled.</b> It cites observations in support of the theory that the collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow does not believe that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|Mattel {{produced}} toys {{based on}} the film through several divisions. Hot Wheels produced die-cast vehicles, race sets and track sets. Tyco produced <b>remote-controlled</b> Mach 5s and racing sets. Radica Games produced video games in which players can use a car wheel. The products became available in March 2008. Also, the Lego Company produced four Lego sets {{based on the}} movie. As part of the General Mills promotional tie-in, during the 2008 Crown Royal Presents the Dan Lowry 400, part of the 2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup season, the famous #43 Dodge Charger of Petty Enterprises {{was transformed into a}} NASCAR Sprint Cup Series version of the Mach 5, driven by Bobby Labonte.|$|E
5|$|Several {{features}} and accessories were {{developed for the}} WonderSwan. The WonderWitch is an official software development kit aimed at amateur programmers that was released by Qute Corporation. It sold {{at a cost of}} ¥11,800 and allows for games to be developed in the C programming language. An adapter was created to connect headphones to the handheld, as the WonderSwan lacks a headphone port. A <b>remote-controlled</b> robot known as the WonderBorg can be operated through the unit. In addition, the handheld can be connected to a PocketStation, a memory card peripheral for the PlayStation console, through a device known as the WonderWave. The WonderSwan and its later models were also capable of connecting to the internet via a mobile phone network.|$|E
5|$|The Paladin Collector's Edition, {{a limited}} {{edition of the}} game, has a <b>remote-controlled</b> plane, the graphic novel Splinter Cell Echoes, a Billionaire's Yacht co-op map, an Upper Echelon pack with a Dead Coast map, gold sonar goggles, and a limited-edition poster. Splinter Cell: Blacklist - Spider Bot, a 2D puzzle game tie-in, was {{released}} for Android and iOS platforms on June 10, 2013 and is available on Google Play and the App Store respectively. Homeland, downloadable content for the game, was released on September 26, 2013. It added a crossbow, several new costumes, and two new missions which can be completed alone or with another player.|$|E
5|$|The {{show was}} {{primarily}} filmed using Sony DSR-570 cameras, although special equipment {{was needed for}} some unique footage. For scenes inside the animals' burrows, mini fibre-optic infra-red cameras were employed; wide-angle shots were filmed with a seven-metre crane and a <b>remote-controlled</b> camera platform. An off-camera wireless microphone was also used to record many meerkat vocalizations, only partially audible to cameras' on-board systems. Most filming was done by a single cameraman and a single sound engineer; researchers have required a minimal human presence to avoid stressing the animals. Eye-level shots were difficult to achieve at times, due to the meerkats' small size and the limited height of even the smallest tripods.|$|E
5|$|Unmanned {{boats were}} the first vessels to enter the lagoon. Onboard {{instruments}} allowed <b>remote-controlled</b> radiation measurements to be made. When support ships entered the lagoon for evaluation, decontamination, and salvage activities, they steered clear of lagoon water hot spots detected by the drone boats. The standard for radiation exposure to personnel {{was the same as}} that used by the Manhattan Project: 0.1 roentgens per day. Because of this constraint, only the five most distant target ships could be boarded on the first day. The closer-in ships were hosed down by Navy fireboats using saltwater and flame retardants. The first hosing reduced radioactivity by half, but subsequent hosings were ineffective. For most of the ships, reboarding had to wait until the short-lived radioisotopes decayed; ten days elapsed before the last of the targets could be boarded.|$|E
5|$|In the {{intervening}} months, the Ministry of Transport had withdrawn permission for further stunts to be filmed on the M40, forcing the production team {{to resort to}} alternative methods to complete the Tiger Moth sequences. The special effects department constructed a -scale model re-creation, located on the Century 21 outdoor backlot to reduce lighting discrepancies, with radio-controlled miniatures of the Tiger Moth made to replace Hughes' aircraft. Ranging from six feet (1.8m) in width to a smaller -scale for filming with the puppet characters, the replicas were unreliable and frequently crashed, but Anderson asserts that the production team successfully merged the full-sized and miniature shots {{so that it is}} difficult to distinguish which aircraft is piloted by Hughes and which is <b>remote-controlled.</b> The scale reconstruction of the M40 bridge was aligned with a backdrop of real trees and fields to simulate the intended setting as faithfully as possible. Bad weather forced the outdoor filming to run for six weeks.|$|E
5|$|Light Yagami, {{the true}} {{identity}} of Kira, discovers {{the location of}} Mello's hideout. An indirect result {{of this is that}} Mello meets the Shinigami Sidoh, the original owner of Mello's Death Note. Sidoh reveals to him—in exchange for some of Mello's chocolate—that there are two extra fake rules (in addition to a number of real ones specified to each Death Note's owner). Mello begins to theorize that whoever Kira is, he probably used these spurious rules to fool the Japanese police into thinking he is innocent. However, Light launches a SWAT team led by Soichiro to raid the hideout. In order to escape, Mello detonates <b>remote-controlled</b> explosives, after one of his Mafia accomplices fatally wounds Soichiro. Mello is left with a scar on his face, and the failure of his Mafia scheme leaves his real name in Light's hands.|$|E
5|$|Spottiswoode {{tried to}} {{innovate}} {{in the action}} scenes. Since the director felt that after the tank chase in GoldenEye he could not use a bigger vehicle, a scene with Bond and Wai Lin on a BMW motorcycle was created. Another innovation was the <b>remote-controlled</b> car, which had no visible driver – an effect achieved by adapting a BMW 750i to put the steering wheel on the back seat. The car chase sequence with the 750i took three weeks to film, with Brent Cross car park being used to simulate Hamburg – although the final leap was filmed on location. A stunt involving setting fire to three vehicles produced more smoke than anticipated, causing {{a member of the}} public to call the fire brigade. The upwards camera angle filming the HALO jump created the illusion of having the stuntman opening its parachute close to the water.|$|E
5|$|The pre-credits {{sequence}} used {{a church}} in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while the helicopter scenes were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London. The gas works were also the location for some of Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film, Full Metal Jacket. Director John Glen {{got the idea for}} the <b>remote-controlled</b> helicopter after seeing a child playing with an RC car. Since flying a helicopter through a warehouse was thought to be too dangerous, the scene was shot using forced perspective. A smaller mock-up was built by Derek Meddings' team closer to the camera that the stunt pilot Marc Wolff flew behind and this made it seem as if the helicopter was entering the warehouse. The footage inside the building was shot on location, though with a life-sized helicopter model which stood over a rail. Stuntman Martin Grace stood as Bond when the agent is dangling outside the flying helicopter, while Roger Moore himself was used in the scenes inside the model.|$|E
5|$|Although Pytka {{fixed the}} ideas on a storyboard, he {{abandoned}} {{it as soon}} as filming began, and followed ideas based on what angles and perspectives the steadycam camera produced. One instance was the filming of the car crash, which Pytka filmed for hours from above, but realised that a steadycam shot on the ground was a much better idea. Archive footage was used by imposing it on scenes shot by Pytka, who utilised a greenscreen stage to digitally blend it into the finished film, such as Paul's Old English Sheepdog in the graveyard, and the elephant in the ballroom procession scene. The elephant was put in last, as Aspinall phoned Pytka and said that Starr liked the scene, but insisted an elephant be put in it, which Pytka later did, as he had already put a sitar in at the request of Harrison. Apart from the steadycam shots, Pytka used a Russian-made Akil-crane for sweeping overhead shots, such as the Abbey Road zebra crossing shot at the end, as well as a <b>remote-controlled</b> toy helicopter with a camera added to it for intricate aerial shots. To make it more interesting, two Blue Meanies make cameos.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Origins {{is an open}} world action-adventure game {{incorporating}} stealth game tactics. Batman can use his cape {{to glide}} around Gotham City and the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to hard-to-reach ledges and extend his flight. Some gadgets from previous Arkham games are present {{at the start of}} Arkham Origins, while others become available during play. Returning gadgets include the Cryptographic Sequencer, used to hack security consoles; the Batclaw, used for hooking onto surfaces; the Batarang, a throwing weapon; the Remote Batarang, its <b>remote-controlled</b> counterpart; Explosive Gel, used to destroy weak surfaces and knock down enemies; Smoke Pellets, used for stealthy exits and entrances; the Disruptor, which can remotely disable guns and explosive mines, and the Grapnel Accelerator, an earlier version of the Grapnel Boost. New equipment in Batman's arsenal include the Remote Claw; this allows Batman to target two objects and pull them together, allowing him to throw enemies into each other or hit them with objects (tethering two walled points creates a tightrope for Batman to cross); Shock Gloves, which allow Batman to block electric attacks, disable some enemies and stun shielded ones, and short-circuit objects, and the Concussion Detonator, capable of stunning large enemy groups.|$|E
5|$|The 20th Panzer and 6th Infantry Divisions of the XLVII Panzer Corps, {{spearheaded the}} advance of the XLVII Panzer Corps. Behind them the {{remaining}} two panzer divisions followed, ready to exploit any breakthrough. The heavily mined terrain and fortified positions of the 15th Rifle Division slowed the advance. By 08:00 safe lanes had been cleared through the minefield. That morning information obtained from prisoner interrogation identified a weakness at the boundary of the 15th and 81st Rifle Divisions caused by the German preliminary bombardment. The Tigers were redeployed and struck towards this area. Red Army formations countered with a force of around 90 T-34s. In the resulting three-hour battle, Red Army armoured units lost 42 tanks while the Germans lost two Tigers and a further five more immobilized with track damage. While the Red Army counter-attack was defeated and the first defensive belt breached, the fighting had delayed the Germans {{long enough for the}} rest of 29th Rifle Corps of the 13th Army – initially deployed behind the first belt – to move forward and seal the breach. Red Army minefields were covered by artillery fire, making efforts to clear paths through the fields difficult and costly. Goliath and Borgward IV <b>remote-controlled</b> engineer mine-clearing vehicles met with limited success. Of the 653rd Heavy Panzerjäger Battalion's 45 Ferdinands sent into battle, all but 12 of them were immobilized by mine damage before 17:00. Most of these were later repaired and returned to service, but the recovery of these very large vehicles was difficult.|$|E

25|$|Remote control {{technology}} {{is also used}} in space travel, for instance the Soviet Lunokhod vehicles were <b>remote-controlled</b> from the ground. Many space exploration rovers can be remotely controlled, though vast distance to a vehicle results {{in a long time}} delay between transmission and receipt of a command.|$|E
25|$|The Lunokhods were {{primarily}} designed {{to support the}} Soviet manned moon missions during the Moon race. Instead, they were used as <b>remote-controlled</b> robots for exploration of the lunar surface and return its pictures after the successful Apollo manned lunar landings and cancellation of the Soviet manned moon program.|$|E
