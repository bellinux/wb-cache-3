50|$|In 1973, the Federal Government under Gough Whitlam {{offered the}} states a two-third subsidy on {{approved}} public passenger transport projects. The Queensland Government {{announced that it}} intended to electrify and modernize the Brisbane suburban network, but the Federal funding did not materialise and the state ended up funding the project itself. In 1974, Elrail Consultants and Transmark were engaged to advise of {{the design of the}} system. Tenders were called in 1975 for the electrification of 150 route <b>kilometres</b> (250 <b>track</b> <b>kilometres)</b> of lines.|$|R
25|$|The {{line has}} three tracks {{for most of}} its length. A fourth track briefly joins south of Eastchester–Dyre Avenue and between Pelham Parkway and Morris Park. The {{southbound}} <b>revenue</b> <b>track</b> is a test track for new A Division trains. The fourth track (a trackbed {{for most of its}} length) was extended for the automation of the line, and was initially used for layup and storage.|$|R
50|$|There is a four track yard {{south of}} the station beneath the <b>revenue</b> <b>tracks,</b> which is used for storing and turning G trains. South of the {{connection}} to the yard, the line ramps up to become a three track elevated line (with the express tracks merging into one track, with switches from the express to the local tracks in the respective directions) before entering Ditmas Avenue station.|$|R
5|$|During normal {{passenger}} {{operation on}} <b>revenue</b> <b>tracks,</b> trains {{are designed to}} be controlled by an integrated Automatic Train Operation (ATO) and Automatic Train Control (ATC) system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention. All trains are still manned with train operators who open and close the doors, make station announcements, and supervise their trains. The system was designed so that an operator could manually operate a train when necessary.|$|R
500|$|Just to the north, the Rockaway Line gains {{two extra}} non-revenue tracks {{straddling}} the two <b>revenue</b> <b>tracks.</b> The western track {{is a test}} track, installed in 2001 and called the Far Rockaway Test Track, while the eastern track is used to relay shuttle trains. The western track extends around [...] or nearly 2 miles, while the eastern track is long enough for one full-length train (...) and ends at a bumper block. The test track was installed in 2001 by New York City Transit's Maintenance of Way Department to ensure that new cars have undergone necessary acceleration and braking tests before being put into revenue service. This was because NYCT needed to recover a greater amount of braking energy and reduce power demand peaks {{with the introduction of}} AC-motored cars with the capability for regenerative braking. A kinetic energy storage system with KESS technology was installed, and as a result, the voltage regulation of the track improved. The system provides voltage support to the <b>revenue</b> <b>tracks</b> as well as reinforcing the voltage of the test track during the testing of new trains.|$|R

25|$|Two {{trackside}} signs exist: The “S”-Sign is {{posted at}} <b>revenue</b> <b>tracks</b> and indicates to the operator that a station is ahead. It {{is located at}} a distance no greater than 1200 feet (365.75 m) before a station platform. The “TB”-Sign is posted to indicate to the operator that an eight-car train (the longest used in the system) is clear of an interlocking (“turnback”) when the train front is flush with the sign, and that the train can turn back in the direction from which it came on the opposite track.|$|R
50|$|Another four-rail {{system is}} line M1 of the Milan Metro, where current is drawn by a lateral, flat bar with side contact, with return via a central rail with top contact. Along some {{sections}} {{on the northern}} part of the line an overhead line is also in place, to allow line M2's trains (that use pantographs and higher voltage, and have no contact shoes) to access a depot located on line M1. In depots, line M1 trains use pantographs because of safety reasons, with transition made near the depots away from <b>revenue</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{installation}} of a computerized financial system is usually preceded by a cost-benefit analysis showing {{a positive impact on}} the facility's financial picture. The administration expects reduction in some operating costs (exclusive of the system and the installation costs) and an improvement in collecting accounts receivable. When California Primary Physicians installed TMR, certain costs were reduced, and the business office did become more efficient. However, because TMR is an integrated medical/financial system, other financial benefits accrued to the practice that billing systems {{would never be able to}} provide.
