500|$|The tank {{broke down}} twice. The distributor's rotor arm broke and a {{replacement}} {{had to be}} sourced from Madrid. Then two of the device's valves used to cool the oil exploded, due to solder melting and mixing with the oil. It was very hot in the tank, despite the installation of ten fans, {{and the lack of}} suspension meant the driver was unable to stop shaking during filming breaks. The tank only moved at , which Vic Armstrong said made it difficult to film Indiana riding a horse against the tank while making it appear faster. A smaller section of the tank's top made from aluminum and which used <b>rubber</b> <b>tracks</b> was used for close-ups. It was built from a searchlight trailer, weighed eight tons, and was towed by a four-wheel drive truck. It had safety nets on each end to prevent injury to those falling off. A quarter-scale model by Gibbs was driven over a [...] cliff on location; Industrial Light & Magic created further shots of the tank's destruction with models and miniatures.|$|E

The drums {{were recorded}} at the studio <b>Rubber</b> <b>Tracks,</b> with Aaron Bastinelli engineering, while the synths were performed and programmed through a MIDI keyboard in Logic. Other assistance in making Lightning included Lar Stalfors mixing [...] "Tonight". The tracks were summed using a Dangerous Music D-Box.|$|E

50|$|Snowcoaches can be {{outfitted}} {{with either a}} <b>rubber</b> <b>track</b> or a ski system (replacing tires). Often called by the brand name Mattracks, these <b>rubber</b> <b>track</b> systems can travel over thinner snow depths and even bare road patches without tearing up roadways. Metal-based ski systems can cause more damage or get stuck when traveling over snow-free patches. Subsequently certain roads may be restricted to just Mattrack-equipped snow coaches, based on road conditions.|$|R

50|$|Many {{manufacturers}} provide <b>rubber</b> <b>tracks</b> {{instead of}} steel, especially for agricultural applications. Rather than a track made of linked steel plates, a reinforced rubber belt with chevron treads is used. In comparison to steel tracks, <b>rubber</b> <b>tracks</b> are lighter, make less noise, create less maximal ground pressure {{and do not}} damage paved roads. The disadvantage {{is that they are}} not as solid as steel tracks. Previous belt-like systems, such as those used for half-tracks in World War II, were not as strong, and during military actions were easily damaged. The first rubber track was invented and constructed by Adolphe Kégresse and patented in 1913; <b>rubber</b> <b>tracks</b> are often called Kégresse tracks.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to present the {{designing}} framework of an off-road special segmented <b>rubber</b> <b>tracked</b> vehicle that may be required to run on low bearing capacity peat terrain.  To complete this study: firstly, mechanical properties of the peat terrain were first determined by using different type of apparatus. Direct shear test was performed using a Wykeham Farrance 25402 shear box apparatus to determine the internal friction angle, cohesiveness and shear deformation modulus of the peat sample. Load-sinkage test was performed using a specially made bearing capacity apparatus to determine the stiffness values of surface mat and underlying peat. Secondly, substantiate the validity of the mathematical model and finally design parameters of the special segmented <b>rubber</b> <b>tracked</b> vehicle were optimized by simulation.   Keywords: Tracked vehicle, peat terrain, tractive performance. </div...|$|R
