The advantages of this method is useful for efficiently encrypting a variety ofdigital images, such as binary images, gray images, and RGB images without any quality loss...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Semiotics is {{the study}} of sign. Sign can be word, gesture, traffic light, flag, and so on. One of the fields which is closely related to {{semiotics}} is advertising. Through advertisement, producers send messages for their product strength to consumers. Those messages are conveyed through various kinds of signs either in the form of language, picture, caption, icon, index, or symbol. Advertisement is also a medium consisting of many kinds of signs. Those signs are used to reveal the strength of a product which is eventually expected to be able to influence consumers to buy it. There is communicative exchange on Coca Cola advertisement between sender and <b>receiver.</b> <b>Sender</b> (advertisement conceptor/maker) of this advertisement makes good use of reward polluter style, that is, persuading consumers to try a new product of Coca Cola. To draw consumers’ interest to buy the product, Coca Cola advertisement uses imperative sentences as well as praising words in its product. Key words : semiotics, gesture, caption, icon, index, symbol, sender and receiver. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{a secure}} message {{transmission}} (SMT) scenario a sender wants {{to send a}} message in a private and reliable way to a <b>receiver.</b> <b>Sender</b> and receiver are connected by n vertex disjoint paths, referred to as wires, t of which can be controlled by an adaptive adversary with unlimited computational resources. In Eurocrypt 2008, Garay and Ostrovsky considered an SMT scenario where sender and receiver have access to a public discussion channel and showed that secure and reliable communication is possible when n ≥ t+ 1. In this paper we will show that a secure protocol requires at least 3 rounds of communication and 2 rounds invocation of the public channel and hence give a complete answer to the open question raised by Garay and Ostrovsky. We also describe a round optimal protocol that has constant transmission rate over the public channel. Comment: An extended abstract of the older version was published in ISIT' 09.

40|$|In {{organizational}} settings, {{performing a}} task {{refers to the}} conscious mode through which people develop and process their own working activities inside organizational contexts. However, some scholars (Bion, 1952; Jacques, 2003) also suggest that emotional dynamics at work are key factors in disturbing, or conversely maintaining, employees’ task execution. To our knowledge, no study has yet explored the role of organizational culture and emotional contagion (Hatfield & Rapson, 1998) as predictors of employees’ abilities to perform their job, namely job competencies. The present paper aims at a) proposing an expanded approach to emotional contagion at work by simultaneously considering how people can capture the emotions of others, namely the receiver perspective, as well as, how people are also able to draw others into their emotional orbits and infect them with the emotions they express, namely the sender perspective (Petitta & Di Cave, 2011); b) proposing a conceptualization of organizational culture grounded in emotionally ways to socially interact in organizations; c) introducing a model of job competencies which encompasses five main domains of skills required to performs a task, respectively entrepreneurship, social, work handling, emotion management, and change management competencies (Borgogni, Petitta, Consiglio, Barbaranelli, 2012); d) studying the role of emotion-related organizational culture and emotional contagion in predicting job competencies. Toward this end, we tested a structural model positing organizational culture as predictor of the two facets of emotional contagion (i. e., <b>receiver,</b> <b>sender),</b> which in turn were expected to differentially predict the five domains of job competencies. Organizational culture, emotional contagion, and competencies. The emotional life of an organization refers {{to the fact that}} people who make up the organization tend to share a specific way of emotionally symbolizing the reality in which they work and coexist. Emotional symbolization reflects the process a human being engages in to associate their experiences with the external environment (context) with an inevitable emotional reaction (Carli & Paniccia, 2003). Organizations, therefore, are a reality in which individuals share a way of emotionally representing the context which organizes and regulates interpersonal relationships and coexistence. According to the TAD, “the local culture of an organization refers to the way in which, in a particular moment in its history, members emotionally characterize functions, integrative instruments, products, clients, and users; in other words, every aspect that contributes to defining the contextual reality” (Carli & Paniccia, 1999, p. 148). As such, organizational culture grounded in emotionally ways to socially interact in organizations is a predictor of emotional exchanges among members (i. e., emotional contagion; Petitta, 2012) and task behaviors associated to competencies required to carry out the job.

40|$|The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) {{can be used}} to make end-toend {{resource}} reservations in an IP {{network in}} order to guarantee the quality of service required by certain flows.

40|$|Performance {{information}} {{is essential to}} the design of efficient parallel programs. Whether the programmer has total control over determining the parallel execution of processes or whether some automatic means are used to parallelize serial or partially parallel code, the cost of the overhead due to parallelization must be known. This is especially important in systems where the costs of such mechanisms are high. In distributed memory systems, message passing is the primary means of communication between parallel processes, and message passing tends to be quite expensive. Users of such systems wrestle with a variety of questions related to performance issues. How is the data to be distributed among the processors? What grain size (amount of code executed serially on a processor) is required for efficient processing? How should the processes be assigned to the system nodes? Approximate answers to these question can be given only if the performance characteristics of the system are known. This paper presents a step towards the development of a performance model for two distributed memory multiprocessor systems, the Intel iPSC/ 2 and iPSC/ 860 hypercubes. From actual timing measurements, we developed formulas to estimate the communication costs on the four possibilities for message passing among multiple processors: a single sender to a single <b>receiver,</b> single <b>sender</b> to multiple <b>receivers,</b> multiple <b>senders</b> to a single <b>receiver,</b> and multiple <b>senders</b> to multiple <b>receivers.</b> A practical method for synchronizing timing measurements among independently clocked processing nodes was developed to do this analysis...|$|R
