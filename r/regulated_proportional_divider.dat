40|$|The distribution, fluctuation, and {{short-term}} transport of total microbial biomass (measured as adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate [ATP]) {{was investigated in}} a large salt marsh creek. Hourly samples were collected synoptically for 25 h from 10 boats positioned across the 320 -m width of the creek. Samples were collected from three depths ranging from 0. 2 to 8. 0 m. Hourly data obtained from each station were graphed, plotting depth against ATP. Subsequently, interpolated ATP values were generated for every one-tenth depth from the surface to the bottom {{with the use of}} an 11 -point <b>proportional</b> <b>divider.</b> A total of 2, 750 values were generated, and a mean value of 0. 865 mg of ATP per m 3 was determined. Maximum levels of ATP were found at high tide and minimal values were found at low tide. The distribution of ATP concentrations was found to be complex, with no suggestion of vertical stratification; however, horizontal divisions were apparent. ATP values corrected for direction of flow or velocity indicated two ebb-directed channels; however, when considered in total, there was a net import of ATP through the interface. The total import of ATP for this 25 -h sampling period was calculated to be 3. 58 kg, corresponding to a net transport of 39. 8 mg of ATP per s through the cross section. Results suggest that detailed characterization of a creek transect in terms of ATP or any similar parameter requires the simultaneous measurements of both the concentration of the parameter in question and the velocity at the time and point from which the sample was taken...|$|R

Nonlinearities cause behavioral change in the system. This paper introduces a nonlinear state space representation of a hydraulic wind energy transfer system. A rate-limit controller is designed to <b>regulate</b> the <b>proportional</b> valve position to maintain the primary motor's reference angular velocity. The performance of the controller is verified with simulation results. The simulation response demonstrates accurate modeling of the system operation and close tracking of the reference angular velocity profile. I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} motion control of single-rod {{hydraulic}} actuators <b>regulated</b> by <b>proportional</b> directional control(PDC) valves with deadband and nonlinear flow gains. The boom motion {{control of a}} hydraulic robot arm driven by a singlerod hydraulic actuator {{is used as a}} case study. The experimental system dynamics are highly nonlinear. In addition, the system has large extent of modeling uncertainties such as the variation of payload and friction forces. Furthermore, the PDC valve used to regulate the control flow rate to the hydraulic actuator has a large extent of deadband and a very nonlinear flow gain coefficient right out of the deadband region. These issues make the precision control of such a system difficult. To deal with these issues, the paper presents a discontinuous projection based adaptive robust controller. Direct inverse is used to compensate for the effect of the valve deadband, and certain straight-line approximations are used to model the nonlinear flow gain coeffi [...] ...|$|R
60|$|On the Power of Natural Selection to <b>regulate</b> the <b>proportional</b> Numbers of the Sexes, and General Fertility.—In some {{peculiar}} cases, {{an excess}} {{in the number}} of one sex over the other might be a great advantage to a species, as with the sterile females of social insects, or with those animals in which more than one male is requisite to fertilise the female, as with certain cirripedes and perhaps certain fishes. An inequality between the sexes in these cases might have been acquired through natural selection, but from their rarity they need not here be further considered. In all ordinary cases an inequality would be no advantage or disadvantage to certain individuals more than to others; and therefore it could hardly have resulted from natural selection. We must attribute the inequality to the direct action of those unknown conditions, which with mankind lead to the males being born in a somewhat larger excess in certain countries than in others, or which cause the proportion between the sexes to differ slightly in legitimate and illegitimate births.|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a theoretical-experimental {{research}} aimed at constructing a tank-truck prototype designed and constructed by the Authors and specifically used to spread olive oil wastes on cropped soil are presented. The transverse distribution was investigated through comparing the test data with the mathematical modelling. The experimental data quite closely follow the theoretical ones, with average values of the volume delivered by each nozzle quite similar {{to each other in}} almost all the investigated cases. On the other hand, for application rates much lower than those most frequently used in olive orchards, (30 m 3 /ha), less regular conic jets are possible near the spreading valves. In view of that, the obtained results, though in agreement with the scarce literature available, have shown that the valves designed to allow a uniform transverse distribution can be optimized both from the mechanical and geometric point of view. Instead, the longitudinal distribution study highlighted no special critical working conditions of the machine; in fact, the recycling <b>regulating</b> system <b>proportional</b> to the advancing speed, allows having response and regulation time of less than 1. 0 s in all the investigated volumes.

In this paper, the stoichiometrical LixLi′ 1 -xNa 0. 06 MnO 2 containing Li 2 MnO 3 phase was synthesized {{depending on the}} two stages which was the characteristic of the ion-exchange route. The additive proportion of Li {{in the first and}} second steps of the ion exchange process was changed in the purpose of <b>regulating</b> the <b>proportional</b> relation of the layered LiyNa 0. 06 MnO 2 and the monoclinic Li 2 MnO 3 (m-Li 2 MnO 3) phases. The LixLi′ 1 -xNa 0. 06 MnO 2 cathode material was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling technique in order to investigate the crystalline structure, surface morphology and electrochemical property. Through our experiments, Li 0. 25 Li′ 0. 75 Na 0. 06 MnO 2 and Li 0. 35 Li′ 0. 65 Na 0. 06 MnO 2 behaved the excellent electrochemical performance. Li 0. 25 Li′ 0. 75 Na 0. 06 MnO 2 could deliver the capacity of 206 mAhg− 1 at 10 mAg− 1 in the first charge process, and Li 0. 35 Li′ 0. 65 Na 0. 06 MnO 2 showed outstanding cycle stability. Its average discharge specific capacity reached 150 mAhg− 1. The improved performance might arise from the existence of the optimal proportion of m-Li 2 MnO 3 phase.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{position}} control of a hydraulic actuator <b>regulated</b> by a <b>proportional</b> directional control valve. The control algorithms based on the proportional-derivative controller have been applied to a specially designed two-channel electro-hydraulic servo system, which {{has the capacity to}} experimentally simulate common circumstances of a typical fluid power circuit. The first system includes the positioning hydraulic cylinder controlled using the proportional valve, a displacement measuring system and a control device in a closed-loop system. In order to add further realism in the control system a second double acting hydraulic cylinder is used to generate the disturbing load. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms is demonstrated for both moving directions as well as for both unloaded and loaded system. The results of the experimental testing have shown that for some industrial applications a relatively good motion control performances can be achieved using a proportional valve as a control component with a simple control algorithm, but for the case of changing operating conditions, some advanced control approaches should be used...|$|R
40|$|Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroidal {{hormones that}} play pivotal roles during plant development. In {{addition}} to the characterization of BR deficient mutants, specific BR biosynthesis inhibitors played {{an essential role in}} the elucidation of BR function in plants. However, high costs and limited availability of common BR biosynthetic inhibitors constrain their key advantage as a species-independent tool to investigate BR function. We studied propiconazole (Pcz) {{as an alternative to the}} BR inhibitor brassinazole (Brz). Arabidopsis seedlings treated with Pcz phenocopied BR biosynthetic mutants. The steady state mRNA levels of BR, but not gibberellic acid (GA), <b>regulated</b> genes increased <b>proportional</b> to the concentrations of Pcz. Moreover, root inhibition and Pcz-induced expression of BR biosynthetic genes were rescued by 24 epi-brassinolide, but not by GA 3 co-applications. Maize seedlings treated with Pcz showed impaired mesocotyl, coleoptile, and true leaf elongation. Interestingly, the genetic background strongly impacted the tissue specific sensitivity towards Pcz. Based on these findings we conclude that Pcz is a potent and specific inhibitor of BR biosynthesis and an alternative to Brz. The reduced cost and increased availability of Pcz, compared to Brz, opens new possibilities to study BR function in larger crop species...|$|R
40|$|Regulated {{interactions}} between kinetochores and spindle microtubules {{are essential to}} maintain genomic stability during chromosome segregation. The Aurora B kinase phosphorylates kinetochore substrates to destabilize kinetochore–microtubule interactions and eliminate incorrect attachments. These substrates must be dephosphorylated to stabilize correct attachments, but how opposing kinase and phosphatase activities are coordinated at the kinetochore is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that a conserved motif in the kinetochore protein KNL 1 directly interacts with and targets protein phosphatase 1 (PP 1) to the outer kinetochore. PP 1 recruitment by KNL 1 is required to dephosphorylate Aurora B substrates at kinetochores and stabilize microtubule attachments. PP 1 levels at kinetochores are <b>regulated</b> and inversely <b>proportional</b> to local Aurora B activity. Indeed, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of KNL 1 by Aurora B disrupts the KNL 1 –PP 1 interaction. In total, our results support a positive feedback mechanism by which Aurora B activity at kinetochores not only targets substrates directly, but also prevents localization of the opposing phosphatase.

40|$|A {{screw press}} machine {{is used to}} {{compress}} the fruit mash between the main screw and the travelling cones to extract the palm oil. The position of the cones against the discharge end of the press cage determines the pressure. The pressure controller {{is an important factor}} in determining the oil loss and nut breakages. A conventional control system which is the band control system, uses a kilowatt meter as a controller in adjusting the press cage pressure. However, the screw press machine can be improved in order to reduce the oil loss and nut breakages. Not much researches has been conducted on reducing the nut breakages as well as oil loss. Therefore, the objective of this study is to minimise the oil loss and broken nuts. The objective can be achieved through upgrading the screw press machine and the use of fuzzy control system. During the course of this research project, the hydraulic system of the screw press machine was upgraded by utilising the proportional pressure relief valve. A current transducer was used to measure the motor current load. A ladder diagram program and fuzzy logic algorithm were written and downloaded into the programmable logic control to regulate the press cage pressure. For comparison purposes, a band control system and fuzzy control system were implemented in the control environment. The performances of both systems were compared in a number of tests. The first test was the oscillation of motor current load with the performance of fuzzy control system that was stabilised at 8. 33 mA. This is due to the reaction of fuzzy pressure controller in <b>regulating</b> the <b>proportional</b> pressure relief valve. The fuzzy control system is able to reduce 1. 20 % of oil loss compared to tiie band control system. The percentage of the broken nuts of the fuzzy control system was reduced by 3. 55 %. This implies that the objective to reduce the breakages is achieved. Thus, the screw press machine with a fuzzy control system is found to be significantly more efficient than the band control system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{function}} of an organ relies upon the proper relative proportions of its individual operational components. For example, effective embryonic circulation requires the appropriate relative sizes {{of each of}} the distinct pumps created by the atrial and ventricular cardiac chambers. Although the differences between atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes are well established, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms <b>regulating</b> production of <b>proportional</b> numbers of each cell type. We find that mutation of the zebrafish type I BMP receptor gene alk 8 causes reduction of atrial size without affecting the ventricle. Loss of atrial tissue is evident in the lateral mesoderm prior to heart tube formation and results from the inhibition of BMP signaling during cardiac progenitor specification stages. Comparison of the effects of decreased and increased BMP signaling further demonstrates that atrial cardiomyocyte production correlates with levels of BMP signaling while ventricular cardiomyocyte production is less susceptible to manipulation of BMP signaling. Additionally, mosaic analysis provides evidence for a cell-autonomous requirement for BMP signaling during cardiomyocyte formation and chamber fate assignment. Together, our studies uncover a new role for BMP signaling in the regulation of chamber size, supporting a model in which differential reception of cardiac inductive signals establishes chamber proportion...|$|R
40|$|The Voltage {{unbalance}} in a three-phase {{grid connected}} system causes performance deterioration of a pulse-width modulation (PWM) of Voltage source converter. It may also produce voltage ripples in the dc link and {{also increase the}} reactive power and have negative impact on grid current. In order to eliminate the voltage ripple along dc link capacitor and the dc component of the reactive power, both positive sequence and negative sequence currents should be controlled separately. Therefore this paper utilizes synchronous reference frame theory. One where the positive sequence currents are <b>regulated</b> by a <b>proportional</b> integral (PI) controller in a positive synchronous reference frame (SRF), and the other negative sequence currents are regulated by a PI controller in a negative synchronous reference frame. The positive reference frame which rotates counter clockwise, the positive sequence will appears as dc, while the negative sequence appears as 100 Hz. In same manner the negative sequence reference frame, which rotates clockwise, where the negative sequence appears as dc, while the positive sequence components appears as 100 Hz. So by eliminating 100 -Hz AC components using an Anti-resonant filter in each SRF, one can measure positive sequence and negative sequence currents separately. The two controllers have bee...|$|R

For this purpose, the modeling of the IC engine fueled by gasoline blended with 10 % v/v of anhydrous ethanol (E 10) and hydrogen as an additive is developed. It is considered that the hydrogen gas is produced according to the IC engine demand, and that the hydrogen gas is obtained by an alkaline electrolyzer. The gasoline–ethanol blend added into the combustion chamber is determined according to the stoichiometric ratio {{and the production of}} hydrogen gas is <b>regulated</b> by a <b>proportional</b> and integral controller (P.

The controller reference is varying according to the mass flow air induced into the cylinder, in order to ensure an adequate production of hydrogen gas for any operating condition of the IC engine.

5000|$|Reactor {{power winding}} current is <b>regulated</b> {{according}} to <b>proportional</b> control mode, when control angle of rectified current source thyristors is changed according to proportional mode depending on mismatching between the prescribed voltage setting and the voltage {{at the point}} of reactor connection. In case of necessity to implement the rapid transfer of the reactor from one quasi-steady-state mode to another one, the scheme of overexcitation/underexcitation is realized. In such case, time to gain full power starting from no-load condition is reduced up to 0,3 s. Constructively, it is possible to ensure every speed of the reactor power variation. However, based on practical experience of MCSR application, the optimal balance between the reactor operating speed and capacity of biasing system has been determined: speed of power increase/relief within 0,3 - 1,0 s, capacity of biasing system - 1 - 2% of the reactor rated capacity. [...] Depending upon desired requirements, MCSR is adjusted {{in such a way that}} would be possible to realize either voltage level stabilization, or consumed reactive power value, or consumed current magnitude. Controlled reactors, same as their non-controlled analogues, are subdivided into bus reactors and line reactors. Based on this principle, MCSR design would be completed with additional element which ensures pre-biasing of electromagnetic part and subsequent inertialess energizing of the reactor (with power increase time less than one cycle of power frequency). Similar to all transformer equipment, MCSR is able to withstand long-term overload up to 120 - 130% as well as should-term overload up to 200%. Moreover, considering the additional measures and the control algorithms, MCSR realizes all functions of uncontrolled shunt reactor including ability to operate within the interval of single-phase automatic reclosing.|$|R
40|$|There is {{evidence}} for {{the idea that there}} is biological (active) control of body weight at a given set point. Body weight is the product of genetic effects (DNA), epigenetic effects (heritable traits that do not involve changes in DNA), and the environment. Regulation of body weight is asymmetric, being more effective in response to weight loss than to weight gain. However, regulation may be lost or camouflaged by Western diets, suggesting that the failure of biological control is due mainly to external factors. In this situation, the body’s ‘set point’ (i. e., a constant ‘body-inherent’ weight <b>regulated</b> by a <b>proportional</b> feedback control system) is replaced by various ‘settling points’ that are influenced by energy and macronutrient intake in order for the body to achieve a zero energy balance. In a world of abundance, a prudent lifestyle and thus cognitive control are preconditions of effective biological control and a stable body weight. This idea also impacts future genetic research on body weight regulation. Searching for the genetic background of excess weight gain in a world of abundance is misleading since the possible biological control is widely overshadowed by the effect of the environment. In regard to clinical practice, dietary approaches to both weight loss and weight gain have to be reconsidered. In underweight patients (e. g., patients with anorexia nervosa), weight gain is supported by biological mechanisms that may or may not be suppressed by hyperalimentation. To overcome weight loss-induced counter-regulation in the overweight, biological signals have to be taken into account. Computational modeling of weight changes based on metabolic flux and its regulation will provide future strategies for clinical nutrition...|$|R
