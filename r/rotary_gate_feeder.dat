40|$|Animal {{movement}} monitors {{have been}} researched since the 1990 ’s. The advent of accelerometer technology into these monitors coupled with wireless technologies to transmit data, and finally sophisticated algorithms and software to transcribe data to graphical {{and easy to}} use decision tools on animal behavior has resulted in many recent behavioral monitor systems becoming commercially available for animals and people. For dairy, many of the systems are neck based on collars, but a recent one has incorporated the accelerometer into an eartag that also has a temperature sensor. At Iowa State University, 36 animals were fitted with an ear tag based behavior and temperature monitor (Cow Manager, Agis Automatisering, Netherlands) to evaluate behavior and ear temperature change and learn the system. Tags were put on breeding age heifers, lactating cows, and transition cows. 34 other tags were acquired and put on transition cows. The system has served multiple purposes at the ISU Dairy. These include monitoring of animals and the herd from a commercial herd standpoint;teaching tool to introduce and embed undergraduate, graduate, and veterinary studentsin the technology(7 classes to date);a platform for 5 undergraduate independent studies to date;and utilized in 5 research projects to date including heat stress, calving behavior, LPS challenge model, calves, and evaluating animals as they adjust to Calan <b>gate</b> <b>feeders.</b> The system has also been a platform for extension presentations both at the ISU Dairy as well as many extension meetings and invited conferences and presentations. The behavior monitoring system has resulted in an excellent herd monitoring and decision system, as well as a teaching, research, and extension tool.

40|$|Two {{types of}} <b>rotary</b> <b>gate</b> microvalves are {{developed}} for flow modulation in a microfluidic system that operates at high flow rate and/or uses particulate flow. This research work encompasses design, microfabrication, and experimental evaluation of these microvalves in three distinct areas compliant micromechanism, microfluidics, and electromagnetic actuation. The microvalve {{consists of a}} suspended gate that rotates in {{the plane of the}} chip to regulate flow through the orifices. The gate is suspended by a novel fully-compliant in-plane rotary bistable micromechanism (IPRBM) that advantageously constraints the gate in all other degrees of freedom. Multiple inlet/outlet orifices provide flexibility of operating the microvalve in three different flow/port configurations. The suspended gate is made of a soft magnetic material and is electromagnetically actuated like a rotor in a variable-reluctance stepper motor. Therefore, an external electromagnetic (EM) actuation at the integrated set of posts (stator) causes the gate mass to switch from its default angular position to a second angular position. The microvalve chip is fabricated by electroplating a soft magnetic material, Permalloy (Ni 80 Fe 20) in a sacrificial photoresist mold on a Silicon substrate. The inlet/outlet orifices are then etched into the Silicon substrate from the back-side using deep-reactive ion etch process. Finally, the gate structure is released by stripping the PR and seed layers. This research work presents the realization of a new microvalve design that is distinct from traditional diaphragm-type microvalves. The test results are encouraging and show the potential of these microvalves in effectively modulating flow in microfluidic systems that may not require a tight seal. The microvalve uses a novel in-plane rotary bistable micromechanism that may have other applications such as optical shutters, micro-locks, and passive check valves. Ph. D.

The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the relationships between RFI, temperament, serum hormones and serum metabolites in growing heifers. A 4 yr study (n = 114 - 119 heifers/yr) was conducted with Brangus heifers (Initial BW = 271 ? 26 kg) that were weaned for 25. 5 ? 8. 6 d prior to high roughage diet adaptation (ME = 2. 0 Mcal/kg DM). Individual dry matter intakes (DMI) were measured using Calan <b>gate</b> <b>feeders</b> and BW measured at 7 -d intervals during the 70 -d studies. RFI was calculated as the residual from the linear regression of DMI on mid-test BW 0. 75 and average daily gain (ADG). Temperament scores and exit velocity (EV) were taken at 0 -d. Temperament index (TI) was calculated as the average of EV and chute score. On 0 -d, blood samples were collected and assayed for partial blood counts (WBC, RBC, hemoglobin, HB), metabolites (total protein, TP; glucose; creatinine; blood urea nitrogen, BUN; ?-hydroxybutyrate, BHB) and hormones (cortisol; insulin-like growth hormone I, IGF-I). Across all heifers, RFI was positively correlated with DMI (0. 70) and feed:gain (0. 59). Heifers with low RFI (0. 50 SD from mean RFI). RFI was weakly correlated (P < 0. 05) with WBC (0. 15), HB (- 0. 11), total protein (- 0. 10), BUN (0. 10), creatinine (- 0. 11) and BHB (0. 13). Hemoglobin and BHB were weakly correlated with all feed efficiency traits except feed conversion ratio (FCR). No phenotypic correlation was found between cortisol and IGF-I with RFI. Temperament was not correlated with RFI. Cortisol, creatinine and glucose were moderately correlated with all temperament traits. Low TI heifers (calm) had significantly higher Final BW, ADG and DMI than high TI heifers. Calm animals had significantly lower cortisol, HB, creatinine and glucose and higher BHB. These results suggest that the temperament and serum metabolites evaluated in this study have limited utility as indicator traits for RFI in growing heifers...|$|R

To determine the effects of source and level of dietary Zn on performance, carcass characteristics and tissue Zn concentration, Angus steers (n = 120; initial weight = 325 kg ? 2. 57) were assigned to diets containing five levels of added Zn (5, 35, 95, 215, or 445 mg/kg) from Zn methionine (ZnMet) or ZnSO 4 in a 2 x 5 factorial arrangement of treatments. Total dietary Zn was 30, 60, 120, 240 and 480 mg/kg. Within treatment groups, steers were assigned to one of two kill groups (kill group I = d 77; kill group 2 = d 126). Steers were housed four to a pen and fed ad libitum a 90 % concentrate diet of primarily corn and cottonseed meal by electronic Calen <b>gate</b> <b>feeders.</b> At the time of slaughter, the right front metacarpal, a 150 g liver sample and the right kidney were obtained from each steer.

Statistical models for carcass characteristics included carcass weight as a covariate. Steers fed ZnSO 4 gained faster (P. I 0) in ADG or feed efficiency due to level of Zn in the diet. Neither source nor level of Zn affected (P >. I 0) carcass characteristics. The composition of the 9 - 1 0 - 1 1 rib section was not affected (P >. I 0) due to dietary treatment.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if feeding behavior traits are correlated with performance and feed efficiency traits in growing heifers. Individual dry matter intake (DMI) was measured in Brangus heifers (n = 115) fed a roughage-based diet (ME = 2. 1 Mcal/kg) for 70 d using Calan <b>gate</b> <b>feeders</b> (6 heifers/pen). Residual feed intake (RFI) was computed as the residuals from linear regression of DMI on mid-test BW 0. 75 and average daily gain (ADG). Heifers with the highest (n = 18) and lowest (n = 18) RFI were identified for feeding behavior measurements. During days 28 through 56 of the 70 -d feeding trial, continuous video recordings were obtained for all heifers. Video images of two sets of four 24 -h periods, two weeks apart, were analyzed for the focal animals. All occurrences of feeding were timed and counted per day, and the eight 24 -h periods averaged to derive the overall feeding event (FE) and meal duration and frequency for each focal heifer. Total feeding event duration was defined as the total min per day the animal?s head was down in the feed bunk. A meal included all visits an animal made to the feed bunk that were separated by less than 5 min. The mean RFI values for the low and high RFI heifers were (mean ? SE) - 1. 03 and 1. 00 ? 0. 03 kg/d, respectively. Low RFI heifers consumed 21. 9 % less (P < 0. 0001) DMI, but had similar BW and ADG compared to high RFI heifers. Heifers with low RFI spent more time (P < 0. 0001) eating (152 vs 124 ? 4. 26 min/d) at a lower eating rate (62. 8 vs 99. 6 ? 3. 28 g/min), but had similar FE frequencies compared to high RFI heifers. Feeding event duration was negatively correlated with RFI while FE frequency and FE eating rate were positively correlated with RFI. However, meal duration and frequency were not correlated with RFI. Therefore, measuring FE characteristics could prove more useful than analyzing meals when trying to predict RFI. Additionally, eating rate appeared to be more closely related to RFI than any of the other feeding behavior traits measured...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{adaptation}} of livestock to repeated transport. This study determined how repeated transport affected calf feed intake, plasma cortisol (CORT), post-transport behavior, and the expression of immune-related genes. Thirty-six 4 -month-old Holstein steer calves were housed in groups of six with each group randomly assigned to either transport (T) or control (C) treatments. The T calves were hauled for 6 h in a 7. 3 m x 2. 4 m goose-neck trailer, at an average density of 0. 87 m 2 /calf, every 7 d for five consecutive weeks. Individual daily intake was determined using Calan <b>gate</b> <b>feeders.</b> Blood samples were obtained in the trailer or home pen via jugular venipuncture before loading, and after 2, 4, and 6 h of transport. Samples were analyzed for CORT, serotonin, tryptophan, and the gene expression of interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 2, interleukin- 12, toll-like receptor- 4, toll-like receptor- 2, and 5 -hydroxytryptamine receptor 2 A in leukocytes. Behavior was recorded for transported calves at 5 -min intervals for 1 h after return to their home pens. The C calves had a higher feed intake than T calves overall (P = 0. 01), on the day of transport (P = 0. 007), and the day after transport (P = 0. 02). Pre-transport CORT concentrations did not differ by treatment (P = 0. 77) or trial (P = 0. 32). However, the T calves had higher response CORT concentrations than C calves during Transport 3 (P = 0. 006), Transport 4 (P = 0. 001) and Transport 5 (P = 0. 02). The T calves had the highest response CORT concentrations after 2 h of transport and the lowest response CORT concentrations after 6 h of transport (P < 0. 0001). Treatment did not affect gene expression in leukocytes, however, the expression of IL- 4 (P = 0. 01) and IL- 6 (P = 0. 05) was significantly lower after 2 h of transport than any other sampling times. These results suggest conflicting conclusions on whether the calves started to acclimate after being transported five times. However, CORT and gene expression differences occurred in response to the blood sampling regimen, which may provide insight to how calves acclimate during prolonged stress...|$|R

The root canals were instrumented with different rotary files, namely, ProTaper Universal, ProTaper Next, and HyFlex CM, to the major apical foramen (AF), short AF, and beyond AF. The root apex was stained with 1 % methylene blue dye and digital images of apical surface of every tooth were taken and development of dentinal defects was determined by using stereomicroscope. Multinomial logistic regression test was performed to identify influencing factors. Results. Instrumentation with rotary files terminated 2 [*]mm short AF and did not cause any cracks. Significantly less cracks were seen when instrumentation with rotary files terminated 1 [*]mm short apical foramen when compared with the instrumentation terminated at or beyond apical foramen (p< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{design of}} an {{automated}} {{air traffic control}} system based on a hierarchy of advisory tools for controllers is described. Compatibility of the tools with the human controller, a key objective of the design, is achieved by a judicious selection of tasks to be automated and careful attention to the design of the controller system interface. The design comprises three interconnected subsystems referred to as the Traffic Management Advisor, the Descent Advisor, and the Final Approach Spacing Tool. Each of these subsystems provides a collection of tools for specific controller positions and tasks. This paper focuses primarily on the Descent Advisor which provides automation tools for managing descent traffic. The algorithms, automation modes, and graphical interfaces incorporated in the design are described. Information generated by the Descent Advisor tools is integrated into a plan view traffic display consisting of a high-resolution color monitor. Estimated arrival times of aircraft are presented graphically on a time line, which is also used interactively in combination with a mouse input device to select and schedule arrival times. Other graphical markers indicate the location of the fuel-optimum top-of-descent point and the predicted separation distances of aircraft at a designated time-control point. Computer generated advisories provide speed and descent clearances which the controller can issue to aircraft to help them arrive at the <b>feeder</b> <b>gate</b> at the scheduled times or with specified separation distances. Two types of horizontal guidance modes, selectable by the controller, provide markers for managing the horizontal flightpaths of aircraft under various conditions.

40|$|Global {{air traffic}} is {{predicted}} to rise long-term (2012 - 2031) {{at an annual rate}} of almost 5 %, signifying a 100 % increase in passenger and freight volumes over the next 15 - 20 years. In view of the environmental consequences, 2011 saw the release by the EU of Vision Flightpath 2050, which sets ambitious goals for pollution and noise reduction (including a 75 % reduction in CO 2, taking the year 2000 as benchmark). A potential CO 2 emission saving in the order of 15 - 20 % is achievable simply by stepping up the efficiency and optimizing the weight of aircraft jet en-gines. One promising option for achieving these targets is the substitution of the very heavy iron and nickel-based super alloys currently in use for high temperature applications by new, lighter materials. Alongside the general weight-saving achievable, this development will also enable an increase in the response times for movable components by up to 50 %. The current work focuses on titanium aluminide alloys based on gamma-TiAl and alpha 2 -Ti 3 Al, which combine the attributes „light, corrosion-protected and extremely tough“. The application potential of this material at moderate to high temperatures (500 °C- 800 °C) makes it a particularly attractive option for manufacturing rotating turbine blades and wheels. The main barrier to the general introduction of TiAl components is the nature of this material: very hard and brittle, and, in a melt, extremely reactive. Cost-effective manufacture of TiAl low pressure turbine blades on the industrial scale is achievable by the near-net shape casting approach. The manufacture of single near net shape prototypes using centrifugal casting has already been successfully demonstrated. However, transferring this approach to industrial standard has not hitherto been possible. Starting from the current technological platform already achieved, this work aims to develop a stable and reproducible manufacturing process chain, thus laying the foundation for future series casting of near-net shape TiAl low pressure turbine blades (up to approx. 300 mm in length) for jet engines. This will enable the transfer of the huge potential of this difficult-to-process intermetallic material to a broad field of application within the aerospace industry. This calls for close investigation of component, material and the various process steps as a complex, rather than in isolation. Alongside the fundamental definition of a casting concept and corresponding process parameters, and the subsequent technology transfer to production plant specifically developed for the production of TiAl components, an essential focus of the technology development within the scope of this paper is an all-round optimization of the casting process. Not only the melt flow up to the shell mould but also mould-filling of the cavities is covered in this research. It is demonstrated that modelling a complex, thin-walled blade geometry is only achievable by goal-oriented adaptation of the crucible tilt process and the <b>gating</b> and <b>feeder</b> technology. Verification of the suitability of both the ceramic material and furnace used in being able to meet the dimensional tolerances demanded then provides the basis for the production of a small series of 600 turbine blades, the setting up of which is based on bringing together knowledge previously obtained. Verification of a stable and reproducible process chain is executed by evaluating process stability and component quality...|$|R
