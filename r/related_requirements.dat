Although considerable {{research has been}} devoted to <b>relating</b> <b>requirements</b> and design artifacts with source code, less {{attention has been paid to}} <b>relating</b> <b>requirements</b> with architecture by using well-defined semantics of traces. We present a tool that provides trace establishment by using semantics of traces between R&A (Requirements and Architecture). The tool provides the following: (1) generation/validation of traces by using requirements relations and/or verification of architecture, (2) generation/validation of requirements relations by using traces. The tool uses the semantics of traces together with requirements relations and verification results for generating and validating traces. It is based on model transformations in ATL and term-rewriting logic in Maude...|$|R

40|$|Requirements {{traceability}} is {{the ability}} to <b>relate</b> <b>requirements</b> back to stakeholders and forward to corresponding design artifacts, code, and test cases. Although considerable research has been devoted to <b>relating</b> <b>requirements</b> in both forward and backward directions, less {{attention has been paid to}} <b>relating</b> <b>requirements</b> with other requirements. Relations between requirements influence a number of activities during software development such as consistency checking and change management. In most approaches and tools, there is a lack of precise definition of requirements relations. In this respect, deficient results may be produced. In this paper, we aim at formal definitions of the relation types in order to enable reasoning about requirements relations. We give a requirements metamodel with commonly used relation types. The semantics of the relations is provided with a formalization in first-order logic. We use the formalization for consistency checking of relations and for inferring new relations. A tool has been built to support both reasoning activities. We illustrate our approach in an example which shows that the formal semantics of relation types enables new relations to be inferred and contradicting relations in requirements documents to be determined. The application of requirements reasoning based on formal semantics resolves many of the deficiencies observed in other approaches. Our tool supports better understanding of dependencies between requirements...|$|R

The outcomes on which I evaluate {{the effects of}} these policies are income, proportion of individuals who are not working, and proportion of individuals who are working full time. The effect of mandatory job search assistance programs is negligible and negative in all cases. I find a dual effect of stringency of work <b>related</b> activity <b>requirements</b> and work <b>related</b> activity <b>requirements</b> on a case by case basis, leading to increased levels of income and full time employment but decreased levels of employment overall. This suggests a cyclical effect whereby TANF recipients are forced into full time labor but soon exit the labor force. I hypothesize that this is due to job mismatch, as TANF recipients do not have time to find a job that is a good match for them...|$|R

The IBC addresses both health and safety concerns for buildings based upon prescriptive and performance <b>related</b> <b>requirements.</b> The IBC is fully compatible with all other published ICC codes. The code provisions are intended to protect public health and safety while avoiding both unnecessary costs and preferential treatment of specific materials or methods of construction.|$|E
50|$|An {{economic}} input-output life-cycle assessment, or EIO-LCA {{involves the}} use of aggregate sector-level data to quantify the amount of environmental impact that can be directly attributed to each sector of the economy and how much each sector purchases from other sectors in producing its output. Combining such data sets can enable accounting for long chains (for example, building an automobile requires energy, but producing energy requires vehicles, and building those vehicles requires energy, etc.), which somewhat alleviates the scoping problem of traditional Life-cycle assessments. EIO-LCA analysis traces out the various economic transactions, resource requirements and environmental emissions (including all the various manufacturing, transportation, mining and <b>related</b> <b>requirements)</b> required for producing a particular product or service.|$|E

A <b>related</b> <b>requirement,</b> NBMR-4, detailed specifications for transport aircraft with similar performance {{to support the}} fighter and fighter-bomber aircraft at remote sites. The Fiat G.222 and Dornier Do 31 were the only designs to fly from a revised requirement (NBMR-22), the Dornier being used for test purposes only.|$|R
50|$|Researchers at the Green Design Institute of Carnegie Mellon University began {{developing}} a web-based tool for performing an EIO-LCA in the 1990s. The underlying software traces out the various economic transactions, resource requirements and environmental emissions {{associated with the}} production of a particular product or service. The model captures all the various manufacturing, transportation, mining and <b>related</b> <b>requirements</b> to produce a product or service. For example, one might wish to trace out the implications of purchasing $ 46,000 of reinforcing steel and $ 104,000 of concrete for a kilometer of roadway pavement. Environmental implications of these purchases can be estimated using EIO-LCA. The current (2002) model is based upon the Department of Commerce's 428 sector industry input-output model of the US economy.|$|E
50|$|The purely {{mechanical}} {{ship operation}} aspect of marine engineering has some relationship with naval architecture. However, whereas naval architects {{are concerned with}} the overall design of the ship and its propulsion through the water, marine engineers are focused towards the main propulsion plant, the powering and mechanization aspects of the ship functions such as steering, anchoring, cargo handling, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, electrical power generation and electrical power distribution, interior and exterior communication, and other <b>related</b> <b>requirements.</b> In some cases, the responsibilities of each industry collide and is not specific to either field. Propellers are examples of one of these types of responsibilities. For naval architects a propeller is a hydrodynamic device. For marine engineers a propeller acts similarly to a pump. Hull vibration, excited by the propeller, is another such area. Noise control and shock hardening must be the joint responsibility of both the naval architect and the marine engineer. In fact, most issues caused by machinery are responsibilities in general.|$|E
5000|$|Test case: A {{test case}} {{normally}} {{consists of a}} unique identifier, requirement references from a design specification, preconditions, events, {{a series of steps}} (also known as actions) to follow, input, output, expected result, and actual result. Clinically defined, a test case is an input and an expected result. This can be as terse as 'for condition x your derived result is y', although normally test cases describe in more detail the input scenario and what results might be expected. It can occasionally be a series of steps (but often steps are contained in a separate test procedure that can be exercised against multiple test cases, as a matter of economy) but with one expected result or expected outcome. The optional fields are a test case ID, test step, or order of execution number, <b>related</b> <b>requirement(s),</b> depth, test category, author, and check boxes for whether the test is automatable and has been automated. Larger test cases may also contain prerequisite states or steps, and descriptions. A test case should also contain a place for the actual result. These steps can be stored in a word processor document, spreadsheet, database, or other common repository. In a database system, you may also be able to see past test results, who generated the results, and what system configuration was used to generate those results. These past results would usually be stored in a separate table.|$|E

40|$|The {{size and}} {{complexity}} of software systems make integration of the new/modified requirements to the software system costly and time consuming. The impact of requirements changes on other requirements, design elements and source code should be traced to determine parts of the software to be changed. Considerable research {{has been devoted to}} <b>relating</b> <b>requirements</b> and design artifacts with source code. Less {{attention has been paid to}} <b>relating</b> <b>requirements</b> (R) with architecture (A) by using well-defined semantics of traces. Traces between R&A might be manually assigned.
