50|$|The {{differences}} between the two forms of medieval ownership - the fief and the allod - diminished over time. Firstly, vassals were no longer required to render services from the 17th century at the latest, and vassals’ rights of inheritance became much stronger in the early modern period, and, secondly, the territorial princes were able to force freemen in the 16th century to make regular tax payments. In the 19th century, feudal law was finally gradually abolished in most European countries largely due to the Napoleonic wars and the influence of the Napoleonic Code.

First, one might note differences in structure. Unlike the French model, the Dutch Code drew a strict contrast between real rights (<b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem)</b> and personal rights (rights in personam). Property provisions were arranged around the principle of ownership. Many differences in content also prevailed. On certain subjects, French law was either amended or repealed. Meijer identifies many key alterations. First, many French statutory provisions were removed. Meijer points to the removal of civil death, a concept which was wholly foreign to Dutch society. Other omissions can be seen where a legal concept was either culturally inappropriate or inconsistent with existing Dutch legal principles. Second, modifications were made to codify prior existing Roman-Dutch law or give effect to Roman-Dutch legal standards. For example, in regard to property, the 1838 Code provided that registering a conveyance was a precondition to pass title in immovable property. This codified the Roman-Dutch abstract system of title transfer (abstracte stelsel van eigendomsoverdracht), thereby replacing the causal system (causale stelsel) of the French code. However, it remained true that the 1838 Code did draw heavily from the Napoleonic Code, as Meijer concludes: ...|$|E

Also some proposals are made at the end of the thesis on how to moderate the organ shortage. The uncertain legal nature of dead human body and separated body parts hinders accurate regulation of the matter in civil law. While living human body is generally seen as an integral part of the personality, there are two ways in which dead human body is looked upon. One considers it as an integral part of personality, which cannot be separated even after death. The other connects the personality strictly to the ability of thinking and acting. Thus the body becomes a subject upon the death. Synthesis of these approaches finds the regime of dead human body depending on the sort of disposal.

2500|$|Property law governs {{ownership}} and possession. Real property, sometimes called 'real estate', refers to ownership {{of land and}} things attached to it. Personal property, refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as stocks and shares. A <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> is a <b>right</b> to a specific piece of property, contrasting to a <b>right</b> <b>in</b> personam which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns mortgages, rental agreements, licences, covenants, easements and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations {{on the use of}} personal property fall under intellectual property, company law, trusts and commercial law. An example of a basic case of most property law is Armory v Delamirie [...] A chimney sweep's boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three halfpence and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. Lord Chief Justice Pratt ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keepers") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a <b>right</b> of possession <b>in</b> the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something could belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time.

40|$|The fact of {{possession}} {{has been so}} correlated with the theory of property {{that it is difficult}} to dissociate ownership from the possibility of physical possession. One finds that the average lawyer, even though he may defind a right in rem as a right enforcible against any person, is extremely apt, unless after especial thought, to explain that it is enforcible against anyone because it pertains to a thing capable of physical possession and control, a thing that could be actually sequestered, from all other persons. Not at all infrequently the term property has been judicially stripped even of its significance of a right, and confined to the objective material thing to which the right might apply. As a matter of fact, comparatively few things have ever been legally recognized as the object of property which have not been tangible. The right to one 2 ̆ 7 s reputation, and, more lately recognized, the right to privacy, for instance, are <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem,</b> although incapable of tangible possession. The right to have a contract performed without interference by a third party and, it has been said, the right created by assignment of a chose in action, are equally <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem.</b> These, and other res, are mere concepts, in no sense whatever corporeal, although the rights concerning them so appertain to the particular person in whose favor they exist as to be truly property rights, and correctly said to be owned by him. But the whole number of these is small compared to the quantity of tangible things which are the subject of property, and even these rights are not usually spoken of, even judicially, in terms of property, as are those pertaining to tangible things...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes two {{hypotheses}} on {{the publicity}} requirement and {{the limitations of}} possession to provide information for legal titling. It then tests these hypotheses by examining how legal systems deal with possession in movable and immovable property, and comparing actual and documentary possession. It concludes that exercise of possession is effective as a titling mechanism when it is observed by independent parties, thus providing publicity and verifiability of titling-relevant elements. However, given that possession is only effective to inform about a single in rem right, direct and automatic reliance on possession for titling requires that all other rights be diluted to in personam status or be burdened by the possessory in rem right. In any case, public knowledge of possession, either in its delivery and/or its exercise, is essential for possession to play a public titling function. Similarly, documentary possession is only effective as a public titling mechanism {{in the absence of}} multiple <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem...</b>|$|E

Not only is this picture not essential to Coase’s purpose, but its limitations emerge when we apply Coase’s central insights to analyze the structure of property itself. This leads to the Coase corollary: {{in a world of}} zero transaction costs, the nature of property does not matter to allocative efficiency. However, as with the Coase theorem, the real implication is for our world of positive transaction costs: we need to subject the notion of property to a comparative institutional analysis. Because transaction costs are positive, property is initially defined in terms of things, uses are grouped under exclusion <b>rights,</b> and <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>rights</b> are widely employed.
