There is {{a wide range of}} small machines designed to be used in offices that produce a few litres of drinking water from the atmosphere. However, there are circumstances where there <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> source of water other than the atmosphere. For example, in the 1930s, American designers added condenser systems to airships– in this case the air was that emitted by the exhaust of the engines, and so it contained additional water as a product of combustion. The moisture was collected and used as additional ballast to compensate for the loss of weight as fuel was consumed. By collecting ballast in this way, the airship's buoyancy could be kept relatively constant without having to release helium gas, which was both expensive and in limited supply.|$|E

500|$|After {{years of}} {{both public and}} {{political}} pressure, the provincial government announced in February2006 that it would begin twinning the entire two-lane portion of the highway from Atmore to {{the south end of}} Fort McMurray, the stretch they deemed to be the most dangerous. [...] Work began in 2006 and was estimated to take at least five years to complete. [...] The first section was completed in 2008 at a cost of $53million, stretching south from Airport Road (then Highway69) to a point south of the Highway881 intersection. [...] The Mariana Lakes Country Store near Mariana Lake was closed in September2008 {{to make way for the}} twinning. [...] It was the only service station between Wandering River and Fort McMurray, but Alberta Transportation had no other options due to the proximity of the lake and utilities. [...] The store's owner was reluctant to relinquish the property but acknowledged that upgrades to the dangerous highway were more important than the continued operation of the store. [...] "The twinning of the highway is far more important, and there <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> other way for us to stay here," [...] she stated.

500|$|Koda {{has even}} {{explored}} {{the themes of}} sexuality and taboos in her lyrics. While listening {{to the music of}} [...] "But", the first thing that came to Koda's mind was homosexuality. Regarding the theme of homosexuality, Koda said in an interview: [...] "I'm {{the type of person who}} thinks that [...] it doesn't matter what sex the other person is. No matter who they are, it doesn't change the 'I love this person' feeling, does it?" [...] The video for [...] "Taboo" [...] portrayed homosexuality and other [...] "taboo" [...] subjects to deliver Koda's message of [...] "there <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> such thing as a taboo". [...] She also said of [...] "Taboo"'s themes, [...] "Instead of trying stuff out and experiencing it, we put up a 'No' sign, we never try to break the taboos" [...] and [...] "Sometimes we shouldn't retreat into safety, we should have courage to do things. Those are the feelings kin the song." [...] Such themes are also present in her music videos: she has incorporated her [...] "sexy" [...] image into her videos since [...] "Crazy 4 U" [...] through sexually charged dances and skin-baring outfits. The video of [...] "Ima Sugu Hoshii" [...] featured two males in sexual positions, and the video of [...] "Juicy", which also featured sexual posturing, was censored in Taiwan.|$|E
500|$|On June 21, Patrick Macdonald of The Seattle Times criticized Jackson, stating, [...] "He {{may have}} lived a {{sheltered}} life, but there <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> excuse for using terms like 'Jew me' and 'kike' in a pop song, unless {{you make it}} clear you are denouncing such terms, and do so in an artful way." [...] Two days later, Jackson decided, despite the cost incurred, {{he would return to}} the studio and alter the offending wording on future copies of the album; [...] "Jew me" [...] and [...] "Kike me" [...] would be substituted with [...] "do me" [...] and [...] "strike me". The music video and some copies of the album still carry the original words, but with loud, abstract noises partially drowning them out. He reiterated his acceptance that the song was offensive to some. Spike Lee claimed {{there was some kind of}} double standard in the music industry. [...] "While the New York Times asserted the use of racial slurs in [...] "They Don't Care About Us", they were silent on other racial slurs in the album. [...] The Notorious B.I.G. says [...] "nigga" [...] on [...] "This Time Around," [...] another song on the HIStory album, but it did not attract media attention, as well as, many years before, use in lyrics of word [...] "nigger" [...] by John Lennon.|$|E

2500|$|Over the years, Lucas often {{exaggerated the}} amount of {{material}} he wrote for the series; much of the exagerations stemmed from the post‐1978 period when the series grew into a phenomenon. Michael Kaminski explained that the exaggerations were both a publicity and security measure, further rationalizing that since the series' story radically changed throughout the years, it was always Lucas' intention to change the original story retroactively because audiences would only view the material from his perspective. The exagerations created rumors of Lucas having plot outlines a sequel trilogy of (Episodes VII, VIII and IX), which would continue the story after 1983's Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Lucasfilm and George Lucas had [...] denied plans for a sequel trilogy for many years, insisting that Star Wars {{was meant to be}} a six-part series, and that no further films would be released after the conclusion of the prequel trilogy in 2005.
