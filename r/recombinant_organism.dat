40|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of urea by urease enzyme of oral bacteria {{is believed}} to {{have a major impact on}} oral microbial ecology and to be intimately involved in oral health and diseases. To begin to understand the biochemistry and genetics of oral ureolysis, a study of the urease of Streptococcus salivarius, a highly ureolytic organism which is present in large numbers on the soft tissues of the oral cavity, has been initiated. By using as a probe a 0. 6 -kpb internal fragment of the S. salivarius 57. I ureC gene, two clones from subgenomic libraries of S. salivarius 57. I in an Escherichia coli plasmid vector were identified. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of one partial and six complete open reading frames which were most homologous to ureIAB-CEFGD of other ureolytic bacteria. Plasmid clones were generated to construct a complete gene cluster and used to transform E. coli and Streptococcus gordonii DL 1, a nonureolytic, dental plaque microorganism. The <b>recombinant</b> <b>organisms</b> expressed high levels of urease activity when the growth medium was supplemented with NiCl 2. The urease enzyme was purified from E. coli, and its biochemical properties were compared with those of the urease produced by S. salivarius and those of the urease produced by S. gordonii carrying the plasmid-borne ure genes. In all cases, the enzyme had a Km of 3. 5 to 4. 1 mM, a pH optimum near 7. 0, and a temperature optimum near 60 degrees C. S. gordonii carrying the urease genes was then demonstrated to have a significant capacity to temper glycolytic acidification in vitro in the presence of concentrations of urea commonly found in the oral cavity. The ability to genetically engineer plaque bacteria that can modulate environmental pH through ureolysis will open the way to using <b>recombinant</b> ureolytic <b>organisms</b> to test hypotheses regarding the role of oral ureolysis in dental caries, calculus formation, and periodontal diseases.

Therefore, modern procedures of agriculture cascaded with the addition of organic and inorganic fertilizers, the use of insecticides and pesticides, the addition of proper water, etc. Various inorganic molecules are used as fertilizers. However, the use of organic manures is also in practice. They have many roles such as improving soil porosity, air holding capacity, water holding capacity, structure, texture, etc. Agricultural scientists suggest using organic molecules for many reasons. Bio-fertilizers of many kinds are used by farmers of all nations. However, these fertilizers are unable to cause tremendous effects on the growth and development of crop plants, even though these fertilizers have cumulative effects. The present work focuses on the use of bio-molecules as bio-fertilizer.

This review focuses on the bacterial component of leaf microbial communities, with emphasis on Pseudomonas syringae—a species that participates in leaf ecosystems as a pathogen, ice nucleus, and epiphyte. Among the diversity of bacteria that colonize leaves, none has received wider attention than P. syringae, as it gained notoriety for being the first <b>recombinant</b> <b>organism</b> (Ice− P. syringae) to be deliberately introduced into the environment. We focus on P. syringae to illustrate the attractiveness and somewhat unique opportunities provided by leaf ecosystems for addressing fundamental questions of microbial population dynamics and mechanisms of plant-bacterium interactions. Leaf ecosystems are dynamic and ephemeral. The physical environment surrounding phyllosphere microbes changes continuously with daily cycles in temperature, radiation, relative humidity, wind velocity, and leaf wetness. Slightly longer-term changes occur as weather systems pass. Seasonal climatic changes impose still a longer cycle. The physical and physiological characteristics of leaves change as they expand, mature, and senesce and as host phenology changes. Many of these factors influence the development of populations of P. syringae upon populations of leaves. P. syringae was first studied {{for its ability to}} cause disease on plants. However, disease causation is but one aspect of its life strategy. The bacterium can be found in association with healthy leaves, growing and surviving for many generations on the surfaces of leaves as an epiphyte.

While still in their infancy, such research efforts demonstrate that the P. syringae-leaf ecosystem is a particularly attractive system with which {{to bridge the gap between}} what is known about the molecular biology of genes linked to pathogenicity and the ecology and epidemiology of associated diseases as they occur in natural settings, the field...|$|E

With the world’s petroleum reserves being depleted {{at a rapid}} rate, vast pollution caused by the inability of nature to break down modern day plastics, and global warming greatly affecting the Earth’s climate, green alternatives to current industrial practices are becoming more necessary now than ever before. One possible environmentally friendly alternative is the production of poly 3 -hydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), biodegradable polymers naturally synthesized by many types of bacteria. PHB {{is the most common}} and easiest to produce PHA, but the polymer is quite brittle and holds little commercial value. However, research has shown that a wide variety of monomers can be incorporated into the polymer chains giving a vast array of physical and material properties to the polymer, some with the potential to be very valuable. With the advances in molecular biology techniques and DNA sequencing technology, metabolic engineering has become a quick and powerful tool for constructing recombinant bacteria with gene sets capable of performing tasks previously unattainable. The main focus of this thesis was to construct a recombinant strain of Ralstonia eutropha capable of producing medium chain length (mcl) PHAs using soybean oil as the sole carbon source. Two approaches were used to accomplish this goal. In one approach the mcl-PHA polymerase gene phaC 1 from Pseudomonas oleovorans was integrated into the genome of R. eutropha in place of the native phaC PHB polymerase. Another approach tested was to construct a plasmid based expression system using homologous recombination in yeast to express an engineered mcl-PHA operon containing the P. oleovorans phaC 1 in conjunction with the phaJ from P. oleovorans or the fox 2 gene from S. cerevisiae on a polycistronic gene cassette in a mutated strain of R. eutropha rendered unable to synthesize PHAs naturally. Both recombinant systems were tested for mcl-PHA production in fed batch bioreactors using minimal media supplemented with soybean oil. GC-MS analysis of cell samples taken from the reactor experiments indicated the <b>recombinant</b> <b>organism</b> harboring the integrated phaC 1 gene accumulated trace amounts of mcl-PHAs, mostly in the form of 3 -hydroxyoctanoate, but the plasmid expression systems showed much higher accumulation of mcl-PHAs with constituents of 3 -hydroxyhexanoate, 3 -hydroxyoctanoate, 3 -hydroxydecanoate, and 3 -hydroxydecenoate. This demonstrated the ability of the recombinant R. eutropha to accumulate mcl-PHAs when grown on fatty acids. It was also demonstrated that R. eutropha has the ability to grow to high cell densities using soybean oil as the sole carbon source, and that foreign gene expression is possible in R. eutropha using plasmid based systems and through gene integrations...|$|E

The highest specific productivity under these conditions was found in batch culture, but the maximal production phase was only of 5 h duration. In hollow-fibre reactors the type of fibre used significantly affected productivity, both with regards to the maintenance of reactor integrity and by allowing passage of the recombinant toroid through the selectively permeable membrane. Where contamination of the product with carbenicillin is to be avoided, these bioreactors are superior to batch or continuous culture...|$|R
40|$|Microorganisms {{and plants}} {{synthesize}} a {{diverse array of}} natural products, {{many of which have}} proven indispensable to human health and well-being. Although many thousands of these have been characterized, the space of possible natural products—those that could be made biosynthetically—remains largely unexplored. For decades, this space has largely been the domain of chemists, who have synthesized scores of natural product analogs and have found many with improved or novel functions. New natural products have also been made in <b>recombinant</b> <b>organisms</b> via engineered biosynthetic pathways. Recently, methods inspired by natural evolution have begun to be applied to the search for new natural products. These methods force pathways to evolve in convenient laboratory organisms, where the products of new pathways can be identified and characterized in highthroughput screening programs. Carotenoid biosynthetic pathways have served as a convenient experimental system with which to demonstrate these ideas. Researchers have mixed, matched, and mutated carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes and screened libraries of these “evolved ” pathways for the emergence of new carotenoid products. This has led to dozens of new pathway products not previously known to be made by the assemble...|$|R
