5|$|Many {{songs on}} Graduation contain {{background}} vocals provided by Connie Mitchell of the Australian dance music group Sneaky Sound System. The collaboration came about when West met her bandmates Angus McDonald and Daimon Downey at a diner in Sydney while touring {{the country with}} U2 around November 2006. Seeking musical inspiration, West asked McDonald for ideas, who in turn suggested that he be introduced to Mitchell. Upon meeting Mitchell after she arrived at Studios 301 where he was recording music during the tour, West had her sing over a vocal track and quickly took a liking to her voice. U2 singer Bono and guitarist The Edge also complimented Mitchell's singing while visiting the studio. Some time later, Mitchell {{received a call from}} West who asked if she could travel to The Record Plant in Los Angeles to begin recording tracks for his third studio album. Mitchell later admitted that while she previously didn't know who Kanye West was and never <b>really</b> <b>cared</b> for hip-hop music, the collaboration has changed her views.|$|E
25|$|Morricone {{never left}} Rome to compose his music and {{never learned to}} speak English. But given that the {{composer}} has always worked in a wide field of composition genres, from absolute music, which he has always produced, to applied music, working as orchestrator as well as conductor in the recording field, {{and then as a}} composer for theatre, radio and cinema, the impression arises that he never <b>really</b> <b>cared</b> that much about his standing in the eyes of Hollywood.|$|E
25|$|Ron Prosor, Israel's {{representative}} to the United Nations, claimed in General Assembly debate on the Question of Palestine, November 2014, that the UN is illogical and tends to lack of sense of justice {{when it comes to}} the case of Israel. He claimed that the UN's focus was solely on Israel, ignoring the thousands murdered and expelled in the Middle East under the tyranny of Radical Islam, and that the Arab–Israeli conflict was never was about the establishment of a Palestinian state but the existence of the Jewish state. He also claimed that the UN is not for peace or the Palestinian people but simply against Israel, and pointed out that if the UN <b>really</b> <b>cared</b> about the situation of the Palestinians, they would have taken at least one decision regarding the situation of the Palestinians in Syria and Lebanon, where Palestinians are being persecuted and systematically discriminated against.|$|E

500|$|Card {{has called}} Ender's Game [...] "unfilmable", [...] "because {{everything}} {{takes place in}} Ender's head", and refused to sign a film deal unless he could ensure that the film was [...] "true to the story".

500|$|... "Earth Song" [...] is a ballad that {{incorporates}} elements of blues, gospel and opera. In the socially conscious track, Jackson issues a wakeup-call about the dire situations that mankind has caused and is facing, ranging from war to devastation to animals and earth itself. [...] The song reveals {{itself to be}} highly spiritual at the end where Jackson calls on people to remember the earth is their inheritance from God via their ancestor Abraham. [...] "What about death again" [...] reminds all to think about eternal death, asking people to check their heart for repentance, or {{to see if they}} <b>really</b> <b>cared</b> at all. Having disfellowshipped himself from Jehovah's Witnesses, Jackson simplified his faith to focus on the Biblical Jesus Christ until his death.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Bill, portrayed by W. Earl Brown, is {{revealed to be}} homosexual {{at one point in}} the game. Druckmann initially left this vague in the script, but was inspired at the script read-through to alter a few lines to further reflect Bill's sexuality. To make Bill interesting, Druckmann explored the concept of contradictory statements; while Bill states that becoming attached to people will lower chances of survival, it is revealed that he had a partner that he <b>really</b> <b>cared</b> for. Bill's role in the game was also to voice Joel's concerns about escorting Ellie, as Joel does not voice them. [...] "he reason to have Bill there is that Bill can actually say that to Joel, and warn Joel about that stuff," [...] Druckmann said.|$|E

500|$|Of Episode 6, The Mirrors Charlie Catchpole wrote [...] "Although I wouldn't want to {{bump into}} {{any of these people}} in a wine bar, I found I <b>really</b> <b>cared</b> about their {{unravelling}} relationships, their sad sexual misadventures, their petty jealousies" [...] and concluded by calling the series [...] "Exquisitely written, stylishly produced, superbly performed." [...] In The Times, Paul Hoggart summarised all six episodes as [...] " [...] a tightrope between satire and sentimentality, frequently falling off on the sugary side", but wrote positively of the writing, directing, acting, and editing. He approved of the deliberately unhappy ending, looking forward to seeing how Rachel's departure would be resolved in the second series. Andy Harries attributed the mixed critical reaction to the unusual timeslot the series was given.|$|E
500|$|... "Dangerous Woman" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Johan Carlsson and Max Martin, with additional writing from Ross Golan. In {{an interview with}} CBS This Morning, songwriter Ross Golan revealed that the track was initially written with Carrie Underwood in mind, and was also pitched to Alicia Keys and Rihanna. The song was ultimately given to Grande because Golan felt that she <b>really</b> <b>cared</b> for the songwriters and would do the song justice. Carlsson performed guitar, piano, synths, tambourine and handled the production and programming with Max Martin who also contributed with vocal production. It was recorded at MXM Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The song was mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The audio mastering was handled by Tom Coyne and Aya Merrill [...] at Sterling Sound in New York City.|$|E

500|$|At age 11, Bell {{became a}} vegetarian. In an {{interview}} with PETA, Bell stated, [...] "I have always been an animal lover. I {{had a hard time}} disassociating the animals I cuddled with—dogs and cats, for example—from the animals on my plate, and I never <b>really</b> <b>cared</b> for the taste of meat. I always loved my Brussels sprouts!" [...] By 2012 Bell became vegan with her husband after watching the documentary Forks Over Knives. During her time in Michigan, Bell fostered animals from Michigan Humane Society and she now supports the San Diego-based Helen Woodward Animal Center. Bell often attends fund raisers for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and other non-profit organizations dedicated to protecting animals. She has a Welsh Corgi-Chow Chow mix named Lola, a Welsh Corgi-Chihuahua mix named Shakey, and a black Labrador Retriever named Sadie, who was 11 years old when she was rescued from Hurricane Katrina and adopted by Bell in 2005.|$|E
500|$|In late 2010, Owumi's agent Goran Gramatikov was {{approached}} by another agent looking for players of African descent to play professional basketball in Libya. By December 27, 2010, Owumi had signed a lucrative deal with Al-Nasr, a team from Benghazi that played in the top Libyan league, and was arriving in the country. Despite fears of the country's instability {{in the midst of}} the budding Arab Spring and discouragement from his girlfriend Alexis Jones, he chose to remain with the team, prompted by the poor conditions in Macedonia. He later said, [...] "The most important thing was to get out of the bad situation I was in, and once I had the opportunity to get some place better to play basketball, that's all I <b>really</b> <b>cared</b> about. I didn't really care about the team, I cared about the money and that it was going to be on time and that I was going to be able to further my career and get to feed my family." ...|$|E

500|$|With polls {{released}} on October 6 showing Roosevelt well ahead, Willkie began to sound an isolationist theme, accusing Roosevelt {{of being a}} warmonger. Many of Willkie's speeches to that point had been on domestic issues, {{but he had been}} advised by Martin, Hamilton, and other advisors that the war was the issue the voters <b>really</b> <b>cared</b> about. Willkie began to argue that Roosevelt would not keep the U.S. out of war, but that he would. He was given room to make this argument by the United Kingdom's increasing success in the Battle of Britain, as it was clear a German invasion was not imminent. The polls showed voters responding positively to this new tack, and Willkie kept on this course {{for the remainder of the}} campaign. Roosevelt reacted by scheduling five speeches for the final days, in which he proposed to rebut Willkie's [...] "falsifications". The president stated, [...] "I have said again and again and again that your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars." [...] Willkie was prone to ad lib remarks, which sometimes led to gaffes: addressing steelworkers, he pledged to appoint a new Secretary of Labor, [...] "and it will not be a woman either". This allusion to Secretary Frances Perkins, the only woman to hold a cabinet position in American history to that point, did not aid him among female voters.|$|E

[...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they <b>really</b> <b>cared</b> about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] LGBT website AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Sloan's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] AfterEllen.com included Torres in their list of the Top 50 Lesbian and Bisexual Characters, ranking her at No. 6 and in their Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters.

500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans.
