Results: Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) activation by high fat diet or lipopolysaccharide impairs adaptive thermogenesis. Conclusion: Obesity-mediated TLR 4 activation represses adaptive thermogenesis through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Significance: Inhibition of TLR 4 /ER stress axis is a novel target to augment BAT activity. Abstract: Adaptive <b>thermogenesis</b> is <b>the</b> cellular process transforming chemical energy into heat in response to cold. A decrease in adaptive thermogenesis is a contributing factor to obesity. However, <b>the</b> molecular mechanisms <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> compromised adaptive <b>thermogenesis</b> in obese subjects {{have not yet been}} elucidated. In this study we hypothesized that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) activation and subsequent inflammatory responses are key regulators to suppress adaptive thermogenesis. To test this hypothesis, C 57 BL/ 6 mice were either fed a palmitate-enriched high fat diet or administered with chronic low-dose LPS before cold acclimation. TLR 4 stimulation by a high fat diet or LPS were both associated with reduced core body temperature and heat release. Impairment of thermogenic activation was correlated with diminished expression of brown-specific markers and mitochondrial dysfunction in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). Defective sWAT browning was concomitant with elevated levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy. Consistently, TLR 4 activation by LPS abolished cAMP-induced upregulation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1) in primary human adipocytes, which was reversed by silencing of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Moreover, the inactivation of ER stress by genetic deletion of CHOP or chemical chaperone conferred a resistance to the LPSinduced suppression of adaptive thermogenesis. Collectively, our data indicate the existence of a novel signaling network that links TLR 4 activation, ER stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby antagonizing thermogenic activation of sWAT. Our results also suggest that TLR 4 /ER stress axis activation may be a <b>responsible</b> mechanism <b>for</b> obesity-mediated defective brown adipose tissue activatio...|$|R
