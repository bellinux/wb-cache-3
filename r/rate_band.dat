25|$|The Asian {{financial}} crisis of 1997 began in Thailand in May 1997, {{where the government}} found it {{harder and harder to}} maintain the Thai baht peg at ฿25 to US$1. By 2 July 1997 Thailand abandoned its defence of the baht, allowing it to float freely. Indonesia, which had massive foreign reserves and was seen as having a strong economy, responded on 11 July 1997, by widening its exchange <b>rate</b> <b>band</b> from 8 to 12%. Indonesia had taken similar actions in the years leading up to the crisis, in December 1995 from 2 to 3%, in response to the Mexican {{financial crisis}}, and in June and September 1996 from 3 to 5% and then 5 to 8%. These actions had been successful in the past in defending the rupiah, but on this occasion there was a more serious crisis of confidence.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Zedillo {{announced}} that his government {{would let the}} fixed exchange <b>rate</b> <b>band</b> increase 15 percent (up to 4 pesos per US$), by stopping the unorthodox measures employed by the previous administration to keep it at the previous fixed level (e.g.,by selling dollars, assuming debt, and so on). This measure, however, was not enough, and the government was unable to hold this line, and decided to let the exchange rate float. While experts agree that devaluation was necessary, some critics of Zedillo's 22-day-old administration argue that, although economically coherent, the way the crisis was handled was a political mistake. By having announced its plans for devaluation, they argue that many foreigners withdrew their investments, thus aggravating the effects. Whether the effects were aggravated further or not, {{the result was that}} the peso crashed under a floating regime from four pesos to the dollar (with the previous increase of 15%) to 7.2 to the dollar {{in the space of a}} week.|$|E

The 2007 budgethis last as Chancellorabolished the 10% income tax rate for the lowest earners (5.1million people), increasing their rate to the next highest, 20%. Earners who fell within the 22% tax <b>rate</b> <b>band</b> had their rate reduced to 20%, and tax allowances were also made for over-65s. These measures came into effect in April 2008. The [...] "10p tax rate cut" [...] as it was commonly referred to, was sharply criticised by Frank Field and several other backbenchers. Field also said that Brown {{did not seem to}} be enjoying his job. Health Secretary Alan Johnson believed that Field was motivated primarily by a personal dislike of Brown, and Field later apologised, saying that he had regretted allowing his campaign to become personal. Chancellor Alistair Darling cut the tax rate for 22 million people and borrowed around £2.7billion to reimburse those on lower and middle incomes who had suffered.|$|E

The investor confidence in Indonesia was shaken, {{and due to}} previous deregulations, much of the Indonesian stock market was owned by foreign investors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{framework}} for the analysis of policy-makers' choices regarding unilateral exchange <b>rate</b> <b>bands.</b> Exchange <b>rate</b> <b>bands</b> are viewed as the outcome of an optimization problem by a policy-maker whose objective function weighs the level of the real exchange rate against the level and variability of the real exchange rate. The analysis endogenizes policy decisions about realignments and about the width of the band. Conditions are developed for the case in which optimal band width widens in response to a decrease in policy-makers' commitment reputation, an increase in the cost of reneging on the existing band, and an increase in the variance of fundamental shocks.
