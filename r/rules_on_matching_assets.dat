40|$|We {{describe}} a constraint-based morphological disambiguation {{system in which}} individual constraint <b>rules</b> vote <b>on</b> <b>matching</b> morphological parses followed by its implementation using finite state transducers. Voting constraint rules {{have a number of}} desirable properties: The outcome of the disambiguation is independent of the order of application of the local contextual constraint rules. Thus the rule developer is relieved from worrying about conflicting rule sequencing. The approach can also combine statistically and manually obtained constraints, and incorporate negative constraints that rule out certain patterns. The transducer implementation has a number of desirable properties compared to other finite state tagging and light parsing approaches, implemented with automata intersection. The most important of these is that since constraints do not remove parses there is no risk of an overzealous constraint "killing a sentence by removing all parses of a token during intersection. After a description of our approach we present preliminary results from tagging the Wall Street Journal Corpus with this approach. With about 400 statistically derived constraints and about 570 manual constraints, we can attain an accuracy of 97. 82 % on the training corpus and 97. 29 % on the test corpus.

The theory of the threshold-optimized decision-level fusion is presented, and the applications are discussed. Fusion experiments are done on the FRGC database which contains 2 D texture data and 3 D shape data. The proposed decision fusion improves the system performance, in a way comparable to or better than the conventional score-level fusion. It is noteworthy that in practice, the threshold-optimized decision-level fusion by the OR rule is especially useful in presence of outliers...|$|R
