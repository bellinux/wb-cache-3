40|$|We {{study the}} {{interaction}} between a neutral atom or molecule and a conductor-patched dielectric surface. We model this system by a perfectly <b>reflecting</b> <b>disc</b> lying atop of a non-dispersive dielectric half-space, both interacting with the neutral atom or molecule. We assume the interaction to be non-retarded and at zero temperature. We find an exact solution to this problem. In addition we generate {{a number of other}} useful results. For the case of no substrate we obtain the exact formula for the van der Waals interaction energy of an atom near a perfectly conducting disc. We show that the Casimir-Polder force acting on an atom that is polarized in the direction normal {{to the surface of the}} disc displays intricate behaviour. This part of our results is directly relevant to recent matter-wave experiments in which cold molecules are scattered by a radially symmetric object in order to study diffraction patterns and the so-called Poisson spot. Furthermore, we give an exact expression for the non-retarded limit of the Casimir-Polder interaction between an atom and a perfectly-conducting bowl. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

Some {{visually}} impaired {{people are able}} to recognize their surroundings by emitting oral sounds and listening to the sound that is reflected at objects and walls. This is known as human echolocation. The present paper reports the calculation of objective auditory cues present in human echolocation by means of the boundary element method using a spherical model of the human head {{in the presence of a}} <b>reflecting</b> <b>disc</b> at different positions. The studied frequency range is 100 Hz to 8 kHz. The results show that frequencies above 2 kHz provide information for localization of the object, whereas the lower frequency range might be used for size determination. It is also shown that stationary sound signals in echolocation can provide relevant acoustic cues, so as displacements in the proximity of a reflecting object become frequency-dependent amplitude modulations. Further calculations in a higher frequency range and with a realistic model of a human head could bring more light to the current knowledge in human echolocatio...|$|E
40|$|Models of X-ray {{reverberation}} from extended coronae {{are developed}} from general relativistic ray tracing simulations. Reverberation lags between correlated {{variability in the}} directly observed continuum emission and that reflected from the accretion disc arise due to the additional light travel time between the corona and <b>reflecting</b> <b>disc.</b> X-ray reverberation is detected from an increasing sample of Seyfert galaxies {{and a number of}} common properties are observed, including a transition from the characteristic reverberation signature at high frequencies to a hard lag within the continuum component at low frequencies, as well a pronounced dip in the reverberation lag at 3 keV. These features are not trivially explained by the reverberation of X-rays originating from simple point sources. We therefore model reverberation from coronae extended both over the surface of the disc and vertically. Causal propagation through its extent for both the simple case of constant velocity propagation and propagation linked to the viscous timescale in the underlying accretion disc is included as well as stochastic variability arising due to turbulence locally on the disc. We find that the observed features of X-ray reverberation in Seyfert galaxies can be explained if the long timescale variability is dominated by the viscous propagation of fluctuations through the corona. The corona extends radially at low height over the surface of the disc but with a bright central region in which fluctuations propagate up the black hole rotation axis driven by more rapid variability arising from the innermost regions of the accretion flow.

The tracking mechanism moves the lens system along the spiral tracks in which information is encoded, and the lens assembly reads the information using a laser beam, typically produced by a laser diode.

40|$|Relativistically blurred {{reflection}} {{from the}} accretion disc provides a powerful probe {{of the extreme}} environments close to supermassive black holes; the inner regions of the accretion flow and the corona that produces the intense X-ray continuum. Techniques by which the geometry and extent of the corona can be measured through the observed X-ray spectrum are reviewed along with the evolution {{in the structure of}} the corona that is seen to accompany variations in the X-ray luminosity both on long and short timescales. Detailed analyses of the narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies Markarian 335 and 1 H 0707 - 495, over observations with XMM-Newton as well as Suzaku and NuSTAR spanning nearly a decade reveal that increases in the X-ray luminosity coincide with an expansion of the corona to cover a larger area of the inner accretion disc. Underlying this long timescale variability lie more complex patterns of behaviour on short timescales. Flares in the X-ray emission during a low flux state of Mrk 335 observed in 2013 and 2014 are found to mark a reconfiguration of the corona while there is evidence that the flares were caused by a vertical collimation and ejection of coronal material, reminiscent of an aborted jet-launching event.

40|$|We {{report the}} first study of Fourier-frequency-dependent {{coherence}} and phase/time lags at optical wavelengths of cataclysmic variables (MV Lyr and LU Cam) displaying typical flickering variability in white light. Observations were performed on the William Herschel Telescope using ULTRACAM. Light curves for both systems have been obtained with the SDSS filters u′, g′ and r′ simultaneously with cadences in the range ≈ 0. 5 - 2 s, and allow us to probe temporal frequencies between ≈ 10 − 3 and ≈ 1 Hz. We find high levels of coherence between the u′, g′ and r′ light curves up to at least ≈ 10 − 2 Hz. Furthermore, we detect red/negative lags where the redder bands lag the bluer ones at the lowest observed frequencies. For MV Lyr time lags up to ≈ 3 s are observed, whilst LU Cam displays larger time lags of ≈ 10 s. Mechanisms which seek to explain red/negative lags observed in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei involve reflection of photons generated close to the compact object on to the surface layers of the accretion disc, where the lag delay is simply the light travel time from the emitting source to the <b>reflecting</b> accretion <b>disc</b> area. Although {{this could be a}} viable explanation for the lags observed in MV Lyr, the lags observed in LU Cam are too large to be explained by reflection from the disc and/or the donor star.

Methods: the study sample included 9 girls and 6 boys (mean age, 9. 3 years; SD, 2. 1) with complete UPXB involving 3 or more posterior teeth and functional shift from centric relation to intercuspal position (patient group). the control group consisted of 10 girls and 6 boys (mean age, 9. 6 years; SD, 2. 1) with normal occlusion. All participants had no signs or symptoms of temporomandibular disorder. Sagittal and frontal magnetic resonance images of the temporomandibular joint with the jaw in closed and open positions were made bilaterally. Three investigators independently interpreted the magnetic resonance images. Results: No intergroup or intragroup differences regarding sex were found, and only 1 subject with articular derangement (disc displacement without reduction associated with disc distortion-folded disc) was found (patient group, same side of crossbite). Conclusions: These findings suggest that temporomandibular joint derangements and functional UPXB are independent occurrences, or that the magnitude of such derangements is still not normally detected by magnetic resonance imaging in children in this age range. Another explanation for posterior crossbite not being <b>reflected</b> in <b>disc</b> displacement is the potential compensatory asymmetrical condyle growth or articular fossa remodeling that can hold the articular disc in position.

40|$|Current {{models of}} the {{spectrum}} of X-rays <b>reflected</b> from accretion <b>discs</b> around black holes and other compact objects are commonly calculated assuming that {{the density of the}} disc atmosphere is constant within several Thomson depths from the irradiated surface.

The density is typically fixed at n(sub e) = 10 (exp 15) per cu cm. Motivated by observations, we consider higher densities in the calculation of the reflected spectrum. We show by computing model spectra for n(sub e) approximately greater than 10 (exp 17) per cu cm that high-density effects significantly modify reflection spectra. The main effect is to boost the thermal continuum at energies 2 approximately less than keV.

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{investigation}} of general relativistic effects on the observed X-ray continuum of Kerr black holes {{in the context of}} the light bending model (Miniutti & Fabian, 2004). Assuming a ring-like illuminating source, co-rotating with the underlying accretion disk, we study the shape and normalisation of the primary and <b>disc</b> <b>reflected</b> continuum as well as the dependence of the observed spectrum on the line of sight for various source heights and radii. These calculations are performed using Monte-Carlo methods to compute the angle dependent reflection spectrum from the disc. The effects of general relativity are illustrated by a comparison with Newtonian and Special Relativity calculations. We find that relativistic distortions can strongly affect the shape of the reflected spectrum. Light bending can dramatically increase the observable reflected flux and reduce the primary emission. In addition, multiple reflections due to the reflected photons deflected toward the disc can alter significantly the shape of the spectrum above 10 keV. Large variations of the ring radius at constant height can lead to an (unobserved) anti-correlation between primary and reflected flux. In another side, the variability behaviour of several sources can be reproduced if the ring source radius is small (< 5 r_g), and its height varies by a large factor. In particular, a non-linear flux-flux relation, similar to that observed in several sources, can be produced. We compare our model with the flux-flux plot of NGC 4051, and find an agreement for low inclination angles (< 20 deg.), ring source radius < 3 r_g and a height varying between 0. 5 to 10 r_g.

We studied the broad-band, persistent, X-ray spectrum using X-ray {{data from a}} XMM-Newton observation, performed almost {{at the peak of}} the outburst, and from a close INTEGRAL observation, performed 3 d later, thus covering the 1. 3 - 70. 0 keV band. The spectrum shows a complex continuum shape that cannot be modelled with standard high-mass X-ray pulsar models, nor by two-components models. We observe broad-band and peaked residuals from 4 to 15 keV, and we propose a self-consistent interpretation of these residuals, assuming they are produced by cyclotron absorption features and by a moderately smeared, highly ionized, reflection component. We identify the cyclotron fundamental at ~ 4. 7 keV, with hints for two possible harmonics at ~ 10. 4 and ~ 15. 8 keV. The position of the cyclotron fundamental allows an estimate for the pulsar magnetic field of (5. 27 ± 0. 06) × 10 11 G, if the feature is produced at its surface. From the dynamical and relativistic smearing of the <b>disc</b> <b>reflected</b> component, we obtain a lower limit estimate for the truncated accretion disc inner radius (≳ 100 R g) and for the inclination angle (18 °- 48 °). We also detect the presence of a softer thermal component that we associate with the emission from an accretion disc truncated at a distance from the pulsar of 50 - 115 R g.

40|$|Intervertebral disc {{cells are}} {{surrounded}} by a pericellular matrix that is biochemically and morphologically distinct from other extracellular matrix regions. Although {{the function of the}} pericellular matrix is not fully understood, prior studies of pericellular matrix-chondrocyte regions in articular cartilage (termed ‘chondrons’) suggest that the size, shape, and mechanical properties of the pericellular matrix significantly influence the micromechanical environment of the contained cells. A first step in understanding the role of the pericellular matrix in the intervertebral disc is to quantify the three-dimensional morphology and zonal variations of these regions across the disc. In this study, three-dimensional reconstructions and morphometric measurements of pericellular matrix-cell regions were obtained in situ using fluorescence confocal microscopy of en bloc sections of nucleus pulposus and anulus fibrosus of the rat disc immunolabeled for type VI collagen. The morphology of the pericellular matrix and cells varied significantly across regions, with distinct pericellular matrix aspect ratios (largest/smallest diameter) showing shapes that were generally large and rounded in the nucleus pulposus (average of 1. 9), and ellipsoidal and discoidal in the inner (2. 4) and outer anulus fibrosus (2. 8). The average pericellular matrix volume per cell was found to be significantly larger in the nucleus (6424 µm 3) than that of inner (1903 µm 3) and outer (1433 µm 3) anulus. Pericellular matrix regions containing 1 or 2 cells were the dominant subgroup in the rat intervertebral disc at both 1 and 12 months of age. Multicellular pericellular matrix regions were present more often in the younger nucleus pulposus and outer anulus fibrosus. The orientation of the pericellular matrix regions further varied significantly across the <b>disc,</b> <b>reflecting</b> local collagen matrix architecture. These studies provide new information on the organization and shape of intervertebral disc cells and their surrounding pericellular matrix, which may provide new insights into the mechanisms that regulate cell-matrix interactions...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{evolution}} of the cold gas (molecular and neutral hydrogen) and star formation activity during galaxy interactions, using a merging galaxy sequence comprising both pre- and post-merger candidates. Data for this study come from the literature, but are supplemented by some new radio observations presented here. First, we confirm that the ratio of far-infrared luminosity to molecular hydrogen mass (LFIRM(H 2); star formation efficiency) increases close to nuclear coalescence. After the merging of the two nuclei there is evidence that the star formation efficiency declines again to values typical of ellipticals. This trend can be attributed to M(H 2) depletion arising from interaction induced star formation. However, there is significant scatter, likely to arise from differences in the interaction details (e. g., disc-to-bulge ratio, geometry) of individual systems. Secondly, we find that the central molecular hydrogen surface density, SigmaH 2, increases close to the final stages of the merging of the two nuclei. Such a trend, indicating gas inflows caused by gravitational instabilities during the interaction, is also predicted by numerical simulations. Furthermore, there is evidence for a decreasing fraction of cold gas mass from early interacting systems to merger remnants, attributed to neutral hydrogen conversion into other forms (e. g., stars, hot gas) and molecular hydrogen depletion resulting from ongoing star formation. The evolution of the total-radio to blue-band luminosity ratio, <b>reflecting</b> the total (<b>disc</b> and nucleus) star formation activity, is also investigated. Although this ratio is on average higher than that for isolated spirals, we find a marginal increase along the merging sequence, attributed to the relative insensitivity of disc star formation to interactions. However, a similar result is also obtained for the nuclear radio emission, although galaxy interactions are believed to significantly affect the activity (star formation, AGN) in the central galaxy regions. Nevertheless, the nuclear-radio to blue-band luminosity ratio is significantly elevated compared with that for isolated spirals. Finally, we find that the FIR-radio flux ratio distribution of interacting galaxies is consistent with star formation being the main energizing source...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} in detail {{one of a}} sequence of numerical simulations which realize the mechanism of binary star formation proposed by Pringle. In these simulations, collisions between stable molecular cloud clumps produce dense shocked layers, which cool radiatively and fragment gravitationally. The resulting fragments then condense to form protostellar discs, which {{at the same time}} fall together and, as a result of tidal and viscous interactions, capture one another to form binary systems. We refer to this mechanism as shock-induced gravitational fragmentation followed by capture, or SGF+C. When the initial clumps are sufficiently massive and/or the Mach number of the collision is sufficiently high, a large number (>~ 10) of protostellar discs is produced; under these circumstances, the layer fragments first into filaments, and then into beads along the filaments. The marriage of two protostellar discs in this way is `arranged' {{in the sense that the}} protostellar discs involved do not form independently. First, they both condense out of the same layer, and probably also out of the same filament within this layer; this significantly increases the likelihood of them interacting dynamically. Secondly, there tends to be alignment between the orbital and spin angular momenta of the interacting protostellar <b>discs,</b> <b>reflecting</b> the fact that these angular momenta derive mainly from the systematic global angular momentum of the off-axis collision which produced the layer; this alignment of the various angular momenta pre-disposes the discs to very dissipative interactions, thereby increasing the probability of producing a strongly bound, long-lasting union. It is a marriage because the binary orbit stabilizes itself rather quickly. Any subsequent orbit evolution, as the protostellar discs `mop up' the surrounding residual gas and interact tidally, tends to harden the orbit. Therefore, as long as a third body does not intervene, the union is binding. Even if a third body does intervene, provided the binary components are well matched (i. e. of comparable mass) and the third body is not too massive, such interventions will - more often than not - harden the orbit further. In two appendices we describe the code used in the simulations presented in this and the companion paper, and the tests performed to demonstrate the code's ability to handle the physical processes involved...|$|R
