40|$|Two virtual {{windows are}} used to {{determine}} the path of a single uniformly moving obstacle. If the path of the obstacle crosses the two virtual windows, then its path can be easily determined. A few simulations were implemented to ascertain the viability and effectiveness of this technique. A table with <b>recommended</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of the uniformly moving obstacle was also provided, given the specified pixel resolution and gap between the virtual windows...|$|E

30|$|For the {{diagnosis}} of track defects {{during the last few}} years, several trains instrumented capable of continuous measurement and all the geometric parameters of interest including the profile of the rail, have been designed. For example the HSRCA system (High Speed Rail Corrugation Analyser), a not-in-contact system with Axle-box Accelerometers, is extremely reliable even at relatively high <b>speeds</b> (<b>maximum</b> <b>recommended</b> running <b>speed</b> of 120  km/h) [26].|$|R

50|$|Due {{to their}} {{complexity}} {{relative to other}} steam locomotive designs, T1s {{were known to be}} difficult to maintain. <b>Recommended</b> to a <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of 100 miles per hour (161 km/h), T1s were so powerful that they could easily exceed their designed load and speed limitations, which in turn often caused wear and tear issues. A technician charged with determining the cause of frequent poppet valve failures on the T1s claimed to have observed them being operated at speeds of up to 140 mph (225 km/h) to make up time. The T1 was designed to run reliably at speeds of up to 100 mi/h km/h. Although such reports are viewed as dubious, some think T1s regularly exceeded 100 mph (161 km/h), making them among the fastest steam locomotives ever built. The price paid for such speed was higher maintenance costs and increased failures in service.|$|R
50|$|Together {{with the}} {{possibility}} to traverse the turret, the commander could also seek for targets independently from the gunner. With a {{push of a button}} located on the left handle of the TPKU-2b device, the turret swung {{into the center of the}} commander's TPKU-2b visor lines not only in horizontal plane, but in vertical too. The turret swung with <b>maximum</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>speed</b> on the view line of the commander and stopped with correspondence of the visor lines. However, the commander had to hold on to his dome and work against the turret rotation, keeping the target in his sights until the turret stopped. This designation method was not totally accurate, but accurate enough for the gunner to see the target in his field of vision.|$|R
40|$|In 1940 R. A. Moyer and D. S. Berry {{established}} ball-banking limiting values (and {{side friction}} factors) {{for use in}} determining the <b>maximum</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>speed</b> of horizontal curves on roads (the value shown on advisory speed plates). This speed is {{also referred to as}} the "advisory speed", "safe speed", or the "comfortable speed" of the curve. This speed is distinguished from the "critical curve speed", the speed value at which loss of control is imminent. Literature review showed some concern for the criteria for the installation of curve warning signs but no recent concern for the goodness of the limiting values. Ritchie et. al. has provided updated research on lateral acceleration values. Their research, plus results of this study, show that the 1940 values are outdated. This work concludes with recommended modern ball-banking limiting values, side friction factors, and lateral acceleration values. Recommendations regarding further research are stated...|$|R

25|$|Ofloxacin has {{not been}} shown to have any {{teratogenic}} effects at oral doses as high as 810mg/kg/day (11 times the <b>recommended</b> <b>maximum</b> human dose based on mg/m2 or 50 times based on mg/kg) and 160mg/kg/day (4 times the <b>recommended</b> <b>maximum</b> human dose based on mg/m2 or 10 times based on mg/kg) when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits, respectively. Additional studies in rats with oral doses up to 360mg/kg/day (5 times the <b>recommended</b> <b>maximum</b> human dose based on mg/m2 or 23 times based on mg/kg) demonstrated no adverse effect on late fetal development, labor, delivery, lactation, neonatal viability, or growth of the newborn. Doses equivalent to 50 and 10 times the <b>recommended</b> <b>maximum</b> human dose of ofloxacin (based on mg/kg) were fetotoxic (i.e., decreased fetal body weight and increased fetal mortality) in rats and rabbits, respectively.

50|$|Many Class 143 {{locomotives}} were in use {{for passenger}} traffic and on longer Regionalbahn and Regional-Express services, so the <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of 120 km/h was awkward, {{especially as the}} carriages often had a <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> of 140 or 160 km/h.
