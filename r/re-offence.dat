40|$|Purpose. In {{community-based}} forensic psychiatry, patients' social {{ties are}} considered as protective {{factor in a}} risk management strategy. However, it is unknown whether these ties actually assist patients to refrain from re-offending. We hypothesised a protective role for social ties in re-offending behaviour. Methods. In a sample of forensic outpatients with a personality disorder (N = 55), the relationship between social ties (social contacts and participation in social institutions) and short-term self-reported <b>re-offences</b> was studied within a prospective study design with a 6 -month follow-up period. Results. Our results provide evidence for a protective function of club participation. For violent <b>re-offences,</b> social institutions were protective and this protective function remained, even when a patient had network members with a criminal background. Except for work-related contacts, social contacts did not provide protection. Conclusions. The protective effect of social ties, especially club participation, on desistance from re-offending in forensic psychiatric patients merits further attention from researchers and clinician...|$|R

The study considers whether the type of crime committed as a first offence predicts chronic or serious offending and also looks at how the numbers and types of first offences have changed over time. The analysis shows that offenders who committed robbery, burglary or vehicle theft as their debut offence in 2001 were most likely to become chronic offenders and that this small group were responsible for a disproportionate amount of <b>re-offences</b> by the cohort.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{some reasons}} for the apparent increase {{in the rate of}} juvenile reconviction between 2004 - 05 and 2006 - 07. Method: Observed and predicted reconviction rates were investigated for the 2004 - 05 (n= 4, 225) and 2006 - 07 (n= 4, 368) cohorts of juvenile offenders given non-custodial sanctions. Various factors (for example, number of prior police cautions) were included in the Group Risk Assessment Model to determine whether they eliminated the discrepancy between the observed and predicted reconviction rates. The profile of <b>re-offences</b> across cohorts was also compared. Results: Two factors may explain the discrepancy between the observed and predicted reconviction rates in 2006 - 07 : (1) a higher than expected rate of reconviction among juveniles dealt with via a Youth Justice Conference; and (2) the absence in the Group Risk Assessment Model of any control for the number of prior police cautions received by a juvenile offender. The higher than expected rate of reconviction among juveniles dealt with via a Youth Justice Conference in 2006 - 07 appears partly attributable to changes in policing practices. Conclusion: It is recommended that the use of the Group Risk Assessment Model be restricted to young offenders dealt with by way of the Children’s Court...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To compare {{estimates}} of re-offending obtained from two sources, police data on persons of interest proceeded against and court finalisation data. Method: Offenders who were convicted in a NSW Local or Higher Court in 2009 {{and received a}} non-custodial penalty were identified. For these offenders, rates of re-offending at 12 and 24 months were estimated using police and court data. Differences between the estimates obtained from these data sources, {{and the effect of}} offender and offence characteristics on these estimates, were investigated. In addition, the time taken for a <b>re-offence</b> to be proceeded against by police or finalised in court was examined and the impact of allowing shorter versus longer periods of time for re-offences to be captured in the data sources was explored. Results: As at 30 June 2011, the proportion of offenders estimated to have re-offended within 12 months was 20. 1 per cent using proven offences in court, 21. 7 per cent using court finalisations (regardless of outcome), 21. 9 per cent using police data where persons of interest were proceeded against to court, and 23. 1 per cent where persons of interest were proceeded against more generally (i. e., to court, criminal infringement notice, cannabis caution). Most, but not all, offenders (94 %) identified as having re-offended using court data were identified as having re-offended using police data. Estimates of re-offending by offender and offence characteristics were similar across data sources. The median time between a <b>re-offence</b> occurring and police commencing court proceedings against the person of interest was 1 day, while the median time between a <b>re-offence</b> occurring and being finalised in court as a proven <b>re-offence</b> was 86 days.

40|$|The {{sexual abuse}} of {{children}} is a serious social concern. Thus, sexual offenders must receive accurate assessments and effective treatment programming to minimise <b>re-offence</b> rates. There is ample evidence in the literature to support the assertion that treatment strategies need to be matched to an offender’s level of risk for <b>re-offence,</b> {{and his or her}} specific risk factors for <b>re-offence.</b> In terms of males, extra-familial sexual offenders are reportedly more likely to re-offend than are intra-familial sexual offenders. If recidivism rates are indeed higher for extra-familial offenders it follows that the assessment and treatment protocols should be reflective of such. In addition, cultural specificity of assessment and treatment strategies is of great import, especially with respect to Canadian Aboriginal peoples given the rates of Aboriginal peoples in Canadian correctional institutions. Based on this preliminary review of the assessment and treatment of sexual offenders in the Saskatchewan correctional system, potential culture-specific assessment and treatment needs {{do not appear to be}} differentially addressed. Additionally, differences in assessment and treatment practices relevant to level of risk do not appear to be present at the provincial level in Saskatchewan. In this paper it is argued that these potential inconsistencies must be examined and empirically investigated in future research and, if indeed present, appropriately addressed in order to provide effective rehabilitation services and to ensure ongoing public safety...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Canada’s Aboriginal peoples face {{a number}} of social and health issues. Research shows that Aboriginal youths are {{over-represented}} {{in the criminal justice}} system and youth forensic psychiatric programmes. Within the literature on sex offending youth, there appears to be no published data available to inform clinicians working with adjudicated Aboriginal youth. Therefore, the present study examines the background, offence characteristics, and criminal outcomes of Aboriginal (n= 102) and non-Aboriginal (n= 257) youths who engaged in sexual offending behaviour and were ordered to attend a sexual offender treatment programme in British Columbia between 1985 and 2004. Overall, Aboriginal youths were more likely than non-Aboriginal youths to have background histories of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), substance abuse, childhood victimization, academic difficulties, and instability in the living environment. Both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal youths had a tendency to target children under 12 -years-old, females, and non-strangers. Aboriginal youths were more likely than non-Aboriginal youths to use substances at the time of their sexual index offence. Outcome data revealed that Aboriginal youths were more likely than their non-Aboriginal counterparts to recidivate sexually, violently, and non-violently during the 10 -year follow-up period. Furthermore, the time between discharge and commission of all types of <b>re-offences</b> was significantly shorter for Aboriginal youths than for non-Aboriginal youths. Implications of these findings are discussed with regards to the needs of Aboriginal youth and intervention...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Aboriginal {{young people}} {{are among the most}} {{disadvantaged}} groups in Australia 12. In 2006, children and youth aged 0 – 24 years represented 57 % of the total Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population in Australia. The age range for Indigenous youth includes several pivotal stages of transition – primary to secondary education, schooling to employment, child to adult. These are uncertain phases for all young people, but particularly for Indigenous young people. If these transitions are not well handled, there is significant risk for immediate and long lasting harm to occur. Aboriginal {{young people are}} fundamental to the continued vitality of Aboriginal identity, but often experience poor health, boredom, and inconsistent care from family members. Of particular concern in certain Aboriginal communities in Central Australia has been the high occurrence of petrol sniffing among Aboriginal youth. In response, the Federal Government implemented the Eight Point Plan, which included the expansion of low aromatic Opal fuel across affected areas and the provision of alternative or diversionary activities. The prevalence of petrol sniffing has decreased following the introduction of Opal fuel in specific communities in 2005, however, outbreaks continue to occur throughout the region. Opal fuel is only one part of the overall solution and to achieve long term benefits to communities concurrent and comprehensive strategies are required. It has now become common for regular ongoing sport and recreation or youth programs to be conducted in a number of remote Central Australian Aboriginal communities. The focus of youth development programs over time has expanded beyond petrol sniffing and other VSM related behaviours to address broader health and social outcomes of young Aboriginal people. Youth programs have shown to {{have a positive impact on}} crime prevention, juvenile criminal <b>re–offences,</b> self–harm and other risky behaviours. Programs are having positive health benefits, including reducing the risk of emotional difficulties. Anecdotal feedback also suggests that activities are promoting child and maternal health, child nutrition and suicide prevention. Organised sport and recreation activities for young people have also shown to influence educational outcomes such as enhancing school attendance and performance, retaining young people in the educational system and improving employment opportunities. Some youth programs have been designed to promote cultural renewal, foster self–esteem, enhance confidences, and develop teamwork, social interaction and skills. Youth development programs and sport and recreation programs have historically been conducted to address VSM (including petrol sniffing) in Central Australia and they continue to be a vital part of the continued response to petrol sniffing outbreaks in the region. While there are significant short and long term health risks for individuals who engage in petrol sniffing, there are also serious consequences for families, local communities and the broader society. The cost of petrol sniffing in the Opal fuel roll out region in 2005 was estimated at $ 78. 9 million. Specifically, the net cost of disease burden of petrol sniffing was a considerable $ 38. 1 million with health, while the long term care and rehabilitation impacts accounted for $ 12 million. It is recognised that the provision of early intervention againstpetrol sniffing is critical with people much more likely to stop early in their ‘sniffing career’ before the practice becomes entrenched. Youth programs that are well conducted have the ability to keep young people safe and teach pro–social attitudes and behaviours to counter negative influences, poorly designed activities may have negative consequences. Yet, few studies have been conducted to explore the value of youth programs given their relatively new status within the research field (Hirsch 2005, cited in 31), particularly within remote contexts. There is also limited exploration of stakeholders’ perspectives (including client, community and professional perspectives) about the effectiveness of youth programs in Central Australia. Of the limited studies that currently exist that assess youth programs in remote Aboriginal communities they remain focused on assessing an individual program or community. Instead, this study collected data from three communities, each from a different part of Central Australia. Programs in these communities were delivered by three different service providers. By doing this we aim to provide a foundation to guide subsequent research to build new knowledge in the field.  ...|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{research}} has shown that there is a causal association between crime, <b>re-offence,</b> and severe mental disorder. Numerous authors have found that psychosis, particularly schizophrenic psychosis, personality disorders, namely antisocial personality disorder, and substance abuse are disorders, which considerably increase the criminal risk. The patients’ decompensation and the associated comorbidity, in this regard, can never be neglected. Therefore, in this paper a review of literature was performed whose goals demonstrate: 1) the relationship between severe mental disorder and crime; 2) the relationship between severe mental disorder and re-offence; 3) the relationship between substance use and crime; 4) the relationship between substance use in individuals with severe mental disorder and crime and <b>re-offence.</b> Promoting the independence and well-being of these patients contributing to the maintenance of social peace, which requires timely monitoring and evaluation of the clinical condition and functionality of the individual, through articulation in a network, which would allow to assess and foster the skills of the individual as a social being. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Traffic law {{enforcement}} sanctions can impact on road user behaviour through both general and specific deterrence mechanisms. General deterrence is typically {{measured in terms}} of community-wide changes in offending behaviour, while specific deterrence is measured by <b>re-offence</b> or recidivism rates. However, recidivism can be conceptualised {{in a number of different}} ways. This paper compares and contrasts different measures of recidivism within the context of managing speeding offenders with regard to absolute and marginal specific deterrent effects. As part of a larger study evaluating the effects of penalty increases in 2003 on speeding offenders in Queensland, the research team considered four definitions of recidivism across two cohorts of drivers detected for speeding prior to (2001) and after (2003) the speeding penalty changes: 1) the proportion of offenders who re-offended in the follow up period; 2) the overall frequency of re-offending in the follow up period; 3) the length of delay to <b>re-offence</b> among those who re-offended; and 4) the average number of re-offences during the follow up period among those who re-offended. Any reduction in speeding will have road safety benefits, however, the ways in which a ‘reduction’ is determined deserves greater methodological attention and has implications for countermeasure evaluation more generally. Overall, results suggested evidence of an absolute deterrent effect of penalty changes in that there were significant reductions in the proportion of drivers who re-offended and the overall frequency of re-offending, consistent with prediction. However, there was no evidence of a marginal specific deterrent effect among those who re-offended. Contrary to prediction, there was a significant reduction in the length of time to <b>re-offence</b> and no significant change in average number of offences committed. Speed camera and radar data were analysed to explore whether the changes in <b>re-offence</b> patterns may have been influenced by changes in speed enforcement activity. This analysis indicated that the speed enforcement operational hours increased by 43 % from the pre to post-penalty change period, suggesting that the reduction in offences observed in the follow-up period was not due to an enforcement effect. Limitations regarding the use of routinely-collected data, as well as issues of exposure, enforcement levels and public education accompanying penalty changes are discussed and areas for future research are outlined...|$|E

40|$|Contract cheating, or {{plagiarism}} via paid ghostwriting, is {{a significant}} academic ethical issue, especially as reliable methods for its prevention and detection in students’ assignments remain elusive. Contract cheating in academic assessment {{has been the subject}} of much recent debate and concern. Although some scandals have attracted substantial media attention, little is known about the likely prevalence of contract cheating by students for their university assignments. Although rates of contract cheating tend to be low, criminological theories suggest that people who employ ghostwriters for their assignments are likely to re-offend, and little is known about <b>re-offence</b> rates in this form of academic misconduct. We combined previously-collected datasets (N = 1378) and conducted additional, and previously-unreported, analyses on self-report measures of contract cheating prevalence. We found that few students (3. 5 %), on aggregate, ever engaged in contract cheating but this varied substantially among samples (from 0. 3 % to 7. 9 %). Of those who ever engaged in contract cheating, 62. 5 % did so more than once. The data also suggested that engagement in contract cheating is influenced by opportunity.

40|$|Aim: To {{examine the}} effect of the Police and Citizen Youth Clubs (PCYC) Young Offender program on re-offending. Method: Young people who were {{referred}} to a PCYC Young Offender program in New South Wales (NSW) between 2010 and 2013 were matched (68 % of 2, 055, n= 1, 405) to a group of young people who were similar in terms of demographic and offending characteristics and not referred (n= 1, 405). Numerous re-offending outcomes were examined and compared for the PCYC-referred and comparison groups: re-offending within 12 months (as a dichotomous outcome), time to the first <b>re-offence,</b> and the rate of re-offences and offending days within 12 months of program referral (or an equivalent date for the comparison group). Results: Within 12 months of program referral, 64 per cent of those referred to a PCYC Young Offender program had re-offended, with a rate of eight re-offences and five offending days per 1, 000 person days of follow-up. Half of those referred had re-offended within 190 days of referral. When compared to a similar group of young people who were not referred to a PCYC Young Offender program, referral was not found to be associated with a reduced rate of re-offending within 12 months, nor with {{an increase in the number}} of days to the first <b>re-offence,</b> or a decrease in the rate of re-offences or offending days in the 12 months following referral.

40|$|Although not the majority, {{there are}} sexual {{offenders}} who recidivate at high rates and {{who continue to}} re-offend despite periods of incarceration and the system’s best treatment efforts, who together comprise a group of particular empirical interest and public concern. The area of sexual violence risk prediction is recognizing the contributions of dynamic risk factors proximal to the <b>re-offence</b> process in identifying increases in risk state. These factors, however, are rarely examined in concert, and their differential presentation across offenders varying in their victim preference and motivational orientation towards offending is not often specified. Certain risk factors may also {{be associated with a}} pattern of escalating violence severity across offences. This dissertation project investigated the relevance of a range of dynamic offence process factors to frequency and severity of offending across various types of sexual offenders. Offence-related information was extracted through an extensive review of 191 files (rapists, child molesters, and mixed offenders) drawn from an innovative law enforcement database containing the highest-risk sexual offenders in British Columbia, Canada. Results demonstrated that a number of risk factors were differentially present between different types of offenders. Further analyses revealed that certain risk factors stood out as statistical predictors of frequent offending across offender type. The presence of cognitive-related factors, as well as certain sexualized behaviours, demonstrated significance in this respect. Conversely, particular non-sexual behaviours were found to indicate a lower level of frequency in sexual offending. Although child molesters had the most prolific offence histories, rapists displayed the greatest severity escalation across their offences. Further, offenders who demonstrated more distorted cognitions and experienced interpersonal conflicts prior to offending were more likely to display escalating severity across their sexual offence histories. Overall, a number of dynamic factors indicated post-dictive utility for identifying frequent and increasingly severe sexual offending. The present line of research delineated specific dynamic factors precipitating <b>re-offence</b> that may assist in refining formulations of risk. The findings may inform criminal justice professionals charged with implementing community-management strategies to monitor risk level, as well as those charged with altering offence-supportive cognitive and behavioural patterns to reduce recidivism...|$|E

40|$|Traffic law {{enforcement}} sanctions can impact on road user behaviour through general and specific deterrence mechanisms. The {{manner in which}} specific deterrence can influence recidivist behaviour can be conceptualised in different ways. While any reduction in speeding will have road safety benefits, {{the ways in which}} a ‘reduction’ is determined deserves greater methodological attention and has implications for countermeasure evaluation more generally. The primary aim of this research was to assess the specific deterrent impact of penalty increases for speeding offences in Queensland, Australia, in 2003 on two cohorts of drivers detected for speeding prior to and after the penalty changes were investigated. Since the literature is relatively silent on how to assess recidivism in the speeding context, the secondary research aim was to contribute to the literature regarding ways to conceptualise and measure specific deterrence in the speeding context. We propose a novel way of operationalising four measures which reflect different ways in which a specific deterrence effect could be conceptualised: (1) the proportion of offenders who re-offended in the follow up period; (2) the overall frequency of re-offending in the follow up period; (3) the length of delay to <b>re-offence</b> among those who re-offended; and (4) the average number of re-offences during the follow up period among those who re-offended. Consistent with expectations, results suggested an absolute deterrent effect of penalty changes, as evidenced by significant reductions in the proportion of drivers who re-offended and the overall frequency of re-offending, although effect sizes were small. Contrary to expectations, however, {{there was no evidence of}} a marginal specific deterrent effect among those who re-offended, with a significant reduction in the length of time to <b>re-offence</b> and no significant change in the average number of offences committed. Additional exploratory analyses investigating potential influences of the severity of the index offence, offence history, and method of detection revealed mixed results. Access to additional data from various sources suggested that the main findings were not influenced by changes in speed enforcement activity, public awareness of penalty changes, or driving exposure during the study period. Study limitations and recommendations for future research are discussed with a view to promoting more extensive evaluations of penalty changes and better understanding of how such changes may impact on motorists’ perceptions of enforcement and sanctions, as well as on recidivist behaviour...|$|E

The evaluation found low rates of failure-to-appear and breaches of court orders. Just under 60 per cent subsequently reappeared in a court and had their charges proven. In most cases, however, the principal <b>re-offence</b> was either less serious or no more serious than the one that had brought them before the Children’s Koori Court. This recidivism rate was within the realm of what was expected given the highly disadvantaged background of the defendants and their established offending histories. Significant reductions in Indigenous juvenile crime will require major structural change...|$|E
40|$|A key {{dimension}} {{of sexual assault}} prevention is stopping perpetrators from re-offending (often referred to as tertiary prevention). Treatment programs that aim to stop re-offending are available for adult and juvenile sex offenders throughout Australia (MacGregor, 2008). There are also numerous monitoring and surveillance mechanisms aimed at released offenders in various states and territories, the purpose {{of which is to}} minimise the chances of re-offending. One way of monitoring effectiveness in this regard has been through the use of recidivism rates, defined below. Rates of <b>re-offence</b> also assist in understanding and addressing issues {{in the criminal justice system}} (Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS], 2001). Yet, results from international studies vary quite dramatically, with recidivism rates of between 3 % and 70 % being reported (Lievore, 2004). In Australia, sexual recidivism rates range from "two percent in some samples to as high as sixteen percent in others" (Lievore, 2005, p. 2). Overall, this is considered low in comparison to other types of offences. What are the reasons for this variation and what can we reasonably consider recidivism rates to tell us? This summary describes how sexual offender recidivism may be measured and discusses the impact this may have in how rates are used...|$|E
40|$|An {{individual}} {{released from}} prison {{after a period of}} time is more likely to experience mental health problems (Bradley, 2009). That individual often faces issues like unemployment and homelessness; drugs and alcohol are then used to overcome problems, leading to <b>re-offence</b> to fund the habit. The criminal justice system and the voluntary sector have always worked together to support ex-offenders on their way towards a successful rehabilitation. This study was designed to conduct a primary qualitative research to investigate charities and explore how they support ex-offenders. It was found that although they both work towards the same objective, the government and the voluntary sector do not share the same opinion on what “success” means. This was understood to be a determinant factor in the way government policies are designed and how charities support their clients. As recommendations, policies on offenders management should be made not only based on cost effective procedures but by considering the needs of the offender. Also, future studies could follow the implementation of the new regulations, and include the service users in the research, in order to explore their perspectives on the services they receive as part of their rehabilitation as well as their mental well-being...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether being referred to the Court Referral of Eligible Defendants into Treatment (CREDIT) pilot program reduces re-offending. Method: Using propensity score matching, adult defendants referred to the CREDIT program, who had their matter finalised in court by 30 June 2011, were matched to control defendants on {{a large number of}} socio-demographic, index offence and prior offence characteristics. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted separately for the two CREDIT pilot sites of Tamworth (n = 261) and Burwood (n = 159). Re-offending was measured until 30 June 2012. Results: No {{significant differences were found between}} defendants referred to CREDIT and their matched controls in the proportion re-offending within 12 months, the number of court re-appearances within 12 months or the time to the first proven <b>re-offence.</b> Conclusion: These results suggest that defendants referred to the CREDIT program are as likely to re-offend as defendants who are dealt with through the normal court process. However, these results may reflect the very small number of defendants referred to the program over the study period, the short follow-up period involved and the inability to match treatment and control defendants on key variables related to offending (e. g. drug use, mental health issues) ...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{licensed}} under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3. 0 Unported LicensePrevious {{research into}} the effectiveness and impact of domestic violence programmes has often focused on recidivism and <b>re-offence</b> data or self-report measures. Such research is constrained by a reliance on incidences of violence being officially reported and by legal definitions of intimate violence, limiting our understandings of women’s lived experiences of safety. Missing voice research is problematic because of the tensions between research processes and the prioritisation of maintaining women’s safety. To be able {{to engage in the}} process of researching women’s experiences of their (ex) partners’ engagement with men’s Living Free from Violence programmes requires an understanding of the complexities of developing relationships and processes that privilege and protect women’s safety throughout the research journey, and necessitates an understanding of the barriers to participation. This involves a collaborative and supportive working partnership to be formed and developed between the researcher and the community, one that at all times maintains the awareness that women’s safety must be the focus of research, both in outcome and process. This paper discusses the complexities involved in our attempts to understand how women experience issues of change and safety {{as a result of their}} partner’s involvement in a local Living Free from Violence programme...|$|E
40|$|Alcohol is a {{major factor}} in road deaths and serious injuries. In Victoria, between 2008 and 2013, 30 % of drivers killed were {{involved}} in alcohol-related crashes. From the early 1980 s Victoria progressively introduced a series of measures, such as driver licence cancellation and alcohol interlocks, to reduce the level of drink-driving on Victoria's roads. This project tracked drink-driving offenders to measure and understand their <b>re-offence</b> and road trauma involvement levels during and after periods of licensing and driving interventions. The methodology controlled for exposure by aggregating crashes and traffic violations within relevant categories (e. g. licence cancelled/relicensed/relicensing not sought) and calculated as rates 'per thousand person-years'. Inferential statistical techniques were used to compare crash and offence rates between control and treatment groups across three distinct time periods, which coincided with the introduction of new interventions. This paper focuses {{on the extent to which}} the Victorian drink-driving measures have been successful in reducing re-offending and road trauma involvement during and after periods of licence interventions. It was found that a licence cancellation/ban is an effective drink-driving countermeasure as it reduced drink-driving offending and drink-driving crashes. Interlocks also had a positive effect on drink-driving offences as they were reduced during the interlock period as well as for the entire intervention period. Possible drink-driving policy implications are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{statement}} that past behaviour {{is the best}} predictor of future behaviour has empirical support in respect of whether an individual will, or will not, commit a criminal offence. People who have offended in the past are more likely to offend in the future. The aims of this study were to develop an instrument and to examine whether the same statement applies in respect of the nature and circumstances of successive offences committed by the same person. METHOD: A rating instrument to describe seven variables relating to the nature and circumstances of a serious offence, the SODI, was developed by the authors. Inter-rater reliability was measured when the instrument was applied to 80 offences committed by 40 patients leaving high secure hospitals. The data were examined for evidence of similarity in the nature and circumstances of successive offences. RESULTS: For five of the seven items of the instrument the kappa coefficients for inter-rater reliability were > 0. 65. No significant associations, in terms of SODI ratings, were found between the offence that led to hospital admission and that which was committed after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The SODI is a reliable instrument for the description of serious offences committed by this group. Risk assessments in psychiatry should be informed by an awareness that in only a proportion of cases will the nature and circumstances of any serious <b>re-offence</b> resemble the nature and circumstances of the offence which contributed to a patient's admission to hospital...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the risk of re-offending of those who received an intensive correction order, relative to those who received periodic detention and suspended sentences with supervision. Method: Details of offenders’ demographic and offence characteristics, prior convictions and penalties received, and re-offences were extracted from the Re-offending Database maintained by the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research. Using propensity score modelling, offenders who received an ICO as a principal penalty in a NSW court between 1 October 2010 and 30 September 2012 were matched to two comparable groups of offenders who received periodic detention between 1 October 2007 and 30 September 2009 and suspended sentences with supervision between 1 October 2010 and 30 September 2012. A supplementary comparison with those who received suspended sentences with supervision included matching on Level of Service Inventory - Revised (LSI-R) assessment scores, in addition to demographic and offending characteristics. Time to first <b>re-offence</b> was estimated using the Nelson-Aalen estimator of the cumulative hazard rate function and compared between groups using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: An offender on an ICO had 33 per cent less risk of re-offending than an offender on periodic detention (HR= 0. 67, 95 % confidence interval (0. 55, 0. 83), p<. 001). There {{was no significant difference}} in re-offending between those who received ICOs and supervised suspended sentences after taking into account LSI-R assessment scores. Conclusion: There is some evidence to suggest that ICOs are more effective than periodic detention in terms of re-offending rates. However, future evaluations should include more detailed offender, treatment and program participation information in order to better understand any observed differences between comparison groups...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports a}} trial of an {{extension}} of the "Under the Limit" Drink Driving Rehabilitation program (UTL) to include ignition interlocks which commenced in February 2001. The task of implementation has been extremely complex and required policy advice and decision support from senior staff on issues such as administrative requirements associated with licensing and offence data, policing, implications for the offender's vehicle insurance, civil liberties and equity issues, and advice on sentencing options and offender supervision. It is considered both impractical and unacceptable for offenders in each court to be randomly allocated to the trial and the solution was to randomly allocate courts to the intervention or control groups, rather than offenders. The current trial aimed to establish if it is possible to achieve reduced recidivism, including post interlock reductions, by using associated systematic rehabilitation and probation {{with the use of the}} interlocks. This model builds on latest international research findings and the work on barriers to the use of interlocks identified in other states in Australia. The importance of trying to implement the interlock in such a way that a sustained reduction in recidivism can be achieved has been a major focus of the project. The model that was accepted for the Queensland trial has an initial period of full licence disqualification during which time the UTL rehabilitation program is completed, followed by interlock installation with no additional restrictions. Currently, 29 participants have installed an interlock and 147 offenders have participated in the research project and formed part of a comparison group. A preliminary evaluation of the trial indicates that interlocks have the potential to reduce <b>re-offence</b> rates as well as produce a positive impact on other key program outcomes i. e., reduce drinking levels. However, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed if interlocks were to be implemented beyond the trial and to move beyond the current limited take up rates...|$|E
