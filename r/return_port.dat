500|$|After {{completing}} his takeover of mainland China in 1949, Mao Zedong sought material {{assistance from the}} USSR, and also called for the return to China of territories taken from it under the Tsars. As Khrushchev {{took control of the}} USSR, he increased aid to China, even sending a small corps of experts to help develop the newly communist country. This assistance was described by historian William Kirby as [...] "the greatest transfer of technology in world history". The Soviet Union spent 7% of its national income between 1954 and 1959 on aid to China. On his 1954 visit to China, Khrushchev agreed to <b>return</b> <b>Port</b> Arthur and Dalian to China, though Khrushchev was annoyed by Mao's insistence that the Soviets leave their artillery as they departed.|$|E

5000|$|Thomas S. Gates ninth major {{deployment}} {{was from}} 29 April 1997 to 27 October 1997. Departing Norfolk on 29 April 1997, with HSL-48, Detachment 1 (Venom 500) embarked, the guided missile cruiser sailed across the Atlantic and in-chopped to the 6th Fleet on 11 May, {{the same day}} she relieved guided missile destroyer [...] as anti-air warfare commander. Following the week-long Exercise Linked Seas (11-18 May), pulled into Palma de Mallorca, Spain, for a five-day port visit. Underway 26 May, the cruiser sailed to Barcelona, arriving there 3 June after conducting a burial at sea with the remains of three World War II veterans. The warship then shifted north on 9 June, arriving at Cannes, France, on 16 June after flying off Venom 500 on the 13 June {{to participate in the}} Paris Air Show. Thomas S. Gates then sailed to La Maddalena, Italy, for a short maintenance period (24-29 June) alongside submarine tender [...] Following Exercise INVITEX 97 (30 June-18 July) in the Tyrrhenean Sea, and a short visit to Naples (18-25 July), the cruiser steamed east for a diplomatic visit to Constanța, Romania, arriving there via Corfu, Greece, on 11 August. The cruiser hosted a press conference on 14 August, as well as a reception for over 200 guests—including Rear Admiral Traian Atanasiu, Romanian Chief of the General Staff—before getting underway for joint Exercise Rescue Eagle 97 (17-18 August 1997) in the Black Sea. The warship then sailed west, arriving in Rota, Spain, on 7 September after stops in Istanbul, Turkey and Livorno, Italy. The cruiser then participated in joint Exercise Strong Tarpon (14-21 September) in the eastern Atlantic before conducting <b>return</b> <b>port</b> visits to Palma de Mallorca, Barcelona and Cannes. After Thomas S. Gates put into Gibraltar on 10 October, she turned over with guided missile cruiser [...] on 16 October before sailing to Bermuda, arriving there 25 October 1997. That same day, just after embarking crew relatives for a Tiger cruise home, the cruiser responded to a distress call, recovering two crewmen from the drifting sailboat Glou Glou. Thomas S. Gates arrived home at Norfolk on 27 October 1997.|$|E
30|$|A 500 -MHz superconducting cavity has a {{bell-shaped}} shell {{structure with}} nominal thickness 3  mm and {{is made of}} highly pure niobium; its mechanical structure is thus weak and soft. The warm cavity itself has a susceptibility to buckle. Taking the TLS 500 -MHz SRF module as an example (shown in Fig.  1), its threshold buckling pressure is about 150 – 200  kPa (21.75 – 29 psia, 1500 – 2000  mbar) for the cavity when warm. This condition forces the operational pressure of a SRF module not to exceed 130.0  kPa (18.85 psia, 1300  mbar), but the routine operational pressure is further decreased to 126.2  kPa (18.3 psia =  1262  mbar) because of other operational concerns. The operating pressure of MD # 1 is thus optimized at 140 – 150  kPa (1400 – 1500  mbar), even possibly to increase its operational pressure to 200  kPa, which is appreciably less than the critical point, 227.5  kPa. The fully loaded pressure drop must thus be within the range 13.8 – 23.8  kPa (1380 – 2380  mbar) for the LHe supply line from MD # 1 to the SRF module of S 1. The suction line of the first compressor, Comp # 1, with warm gaseous helium returned from CB # 1 has a pressure designed to be slightly above atmospheric pressure to avoid sucking air into the cryogenic plant, i.e. 105  kPa (1050  mbar). The CGHe return pressure drop of the heat exchangers inside CB # 1 of medium size is about 15 – 20  kPa (150 – 200  mbar), dependent on the operational mass flow rate from the CGHe return line. CB # 1 takes a pressure drop 17.5 – 19.0  kPa (175 – 190  mbar) when fully loaded; i.e. when both the on-duty and tested SRF modules are in operation concurrently. An acceptable pressure drop within 3.7 – 2.2  kPa is consequently reserved for the CGHe return line from the SRF module on duty back to the cold <b>return</b> <b>port</b> of CB # 1. Such a tight constraint on the maximum allowable pressure drop creates extreme difficulty for the transfer of two-phase helium fluid if the cryogenic flexible transfer lines are long.|$|E
