The <b>revolving</b> <b>window</b> opening angle is simulated and analyzed, and the impact of different air rates on the indoor temperature is analyzed. This system can regulate the indoor temperature to effectively reach the optimal human comfort temperature, and can reduce the frequency of using air conditioning, in order to attain the goals of energy saving, carbon reduction, and environmental protection...|$|R

40|$|Objective of {{the study}} This study aimed to analyze how fashion stores {{communicate}} the corporate identity through <b>window</b> <b>displays.</b> The <b>window</b> <b>display</b> is {{a crucial part of}} visual merchandising, which remains an important channel of corporate marketing communication. However, little attention so far has been paid to how the <b>window</b> <b>display</b> works as a channel for companies to communicate corporate identity. This research tried to fill the gap by studying the <b>window</b> <b>displays</b> of fashion stores. Methodology and the Analytical framework The study adopted the semiotic approach to analyze the <b>window</b> <b>displays</b> of ten fashion stores located in Helsinki. From the semiotic perspective, the <b>window</b> <b>display</b> can be regarded as a semiotic resource as well as a sign system containing multiple visual messages. In addition, this research utilized an analytical framework adapted from Kress and van Leeuwen's (2006) three-metafunction framework of visual communication to analyze the <b>window</b> <b>displays</b> of the ten fashion stores. Findings and Conclusion Based on the analytical framework, the findings were elaborated according to the three metafunctions namely the ideational metafunction, the interpersonal metafunction, and the textual metafunction of the <b>window</b> <b>displays.</b> The results demonstrated that the fashion stores have integrated multiple signs and elements in their <b>window</b> <b>displays</b> to communicate corporate identity: 1) Clothing communication is the most salient and efficient in representing and communicating corporate identity; 2) Images and background are utilized as enhancement; 3) The less salient elements are used to support the communication of corporate identity. However, <b>window</b> <b>displays</b> have limitations in communicating corporate identity too. In some <b>window</b> <b>displays,</b> part of the corporate identity is missing, and the visual presentations are not recognizable...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{attempts to}} identify the role of <b>window</b> <b>display</b> in today's arena of fashion retailing and formulate a system of approaches that can be considered useful in designing the image of <b>window</b> <b>display.</b> The literature view provides {{a review of the}} aspects of knowledge thought {{to be related to the}} subject of <b>window</b> <b>display.</b> The review covers the area of fashion marketing with regard to the history of fashion retailing, fashion marketing promotion mix and store atmospherics. <b>Window</b> <b>display</b> shares similar principles with fashion marketing and promotion mix, but demonstrates uniqueness with regard to its aesthetic and commercial functions. The design tactics of <b>window</b> <b>display</b> need to be adopted to gear to the complexity of the fashion market. Designing store window should not only depend upon the creativity of the designer, marketers and designers need to cooperate to create <b>window</b> <b>displays</b> which can attract attention and encourage consumers' patronage. The 'market in' principles have now penetrated into every aspect of fashion marketing. It becomes essentially important to transform the attributes of consumers' preference into aspects of design in order to make the design outcome effective in influencing consumer behaviour. This investigation shows an initial step in investigating the various aspects of <b>window</b> <b>displays.</b> Five experiments and surveys have been taken to attempt on the approaches which can be used to possibly improve the effectiveness of <b>window</b> <b>display.</b> The emphasis of the experiments and surveys were focused on the perspective in viewing a <b>window</b> <b>display.</b> Finally, the implication of the literature reviews and the research findings, together with the recommendations are valued. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 <b>Window</b> <b>displays</b> are an {{important}} means by which retailers communicate with both current and potential consumers. The present study investigated how the use of context setting (with or without) in a <b>window</b> <b>display</b> and background music (with or without) influence consumers' mental imagery, arousal response, attitude toward the display, and approach-avoidance behaviors. Furthermore, consumer involvement was investigated as a moderator {{in the relationship between}} context setting of a <b>window</b> <b>display</b> and mental imagery. A two by two factorial between-subjects experimental design with two independent variables, four dependent variables and one moderator was conducted. The independent variables in this study were the <b>window</b> <b>display</b> (with or without a context setting) and background music (with or without background music). Mental imagery, arousal response, the attitude toward the display, and approach and avoidance behavior were the four dependent variables. Consumer involvement was tested as the moderator in present study. 202 male and female university students participated in the study by observing one of four <b>window</b> <b>display</b> and completing a survey that measured first impressions of the <b>window</b> <b>display,</b> mental imagery, arousal response, attitude toward display, approach-avoidance behavior, and consumer involvement. The overall results showed that the context setting of a <b>window</b> <b>display</b> had significant effects on consumers' mental imagery and arousal response. Mental imagery and arousal response also had a significant influence on the attitude toward the display and consumers' approach behavior. Background music, however, showed no statistically significant effect on mental imagery nor on arousal response. Consumer involvement also had no interaction effect on the context setting of a window display-mental imagery relationship. The findings of the present study provide {{an important}} implication that <b>window</b> <b>display</b> with a context setting can improve consumers' positive behaviors. Therefore, visual merchandiser can effectively use of this information to achieve their ultimate goals of increasing purchasing behaviors. ...|$|R

Consumers can get fashion information from shop windows; stores can attract consumers and stimulate their purchase desire. The main purpose of <b>window</b> <b>display</b> is to attraction consumerâ€™s attention, deliver the productâ€™s information and induce consumerâ€™s memory connection. Therefore, vision composition of <b>window</b> <b>display</b> can create psychological feeling and emotion and it will be the first store image information received by consumers; it mainly influences consumerâ€™s decision of whether to stay or make a purchase and so it turns out to be the key factor which determines the success of <b>window</b> <b>display.</b> This research is based on the multitudinous conditions of the vision requirement and the numerous complicated formations of the <b>window</b> <b>display</b> in order to satisfy the visual perception. Through the measurement of the eye-tracker equipment (Face Lab), we seek to understand while the consumers are viewing the <b>window</b> <b>display,</b> how can the various design affect the visual focus and the route production of the consumers. Therefore, it is known through the result of this researchâ€™s experiment that 1) when the subject is viewing the <b>windows</b> <b>display,</b> the first visual focus is placed on the central position of the windows, and the visual tracking is been emphasized on the displayed products; 2) The different display position of the products will cast an effect on the concentration distributio...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the visual communication of fashion brand identity through the concept of <b>window</b> <b>displays.</b> <b>Window</b> <b>displays</b> are often categorized as an aspect of a much larger concept of visual merchandising that should be seen as a crucial part of the entire marketing communications. Although the concept of <b>window</b> <b>displays</b> is not new, their effect on the overall brand image creation remains relatively unexplored. The interpretation of communication in a visual form is complex in nature, and this research approaches the matter from a semiotic perspective. The approach was selected due to its capability to explore deeper meanings behind visual objects. In this study, <b>window</b> <b>display</b> is understood as a crucial part of the sign system of a fashion store. <b>Window</b> <b>display</b> is commonly regarded as the starting point of the entire shopping experience, and therefore in the lack of previous research, it is a logical starting point for this study. The analytical framework of the study follows the thee metafunctions of semiotic modes as discussed in the Theory of the Grammar of Visual Design by Kress and van Leeuwen (2006). The analytical framework is then applied to analyze six different <b>window</b> <b>displays</b> produced by the same fashion brand. Findings of the research are discussed in terms of the three metafunctions of ideational, interpersonal and textual, and the purpose is to increase the knowledge of how <b>window</b> <b>displays</b> can be used to depict different relations between brand, people, places and things. In terms of brand identity communication, the most important contribution is to understand the complex relationship that is formed between the window (the brand) and its viewer (the customer). As a result, this research finds that the <b>window</b> <b>displays</b> are loaded with multiple visual cues all of which intend to serve the same purpose of brand identity communication. Clothing and accessories are the most salient elements used and they can be understood as the embodiment of the brand identity. Images of models and mannequins are used to address the viewers and create a specific relationship with them. The less salient elements in the <b>window</b> <b>displays</b> are used to support the message the brand is conveying through the display...|$|R
