25|$|Lima was an Italian {{company that}} was a popular, {{affordable}} supplier of model <b>railway</b> <b>material</b> but market pressures in the mid-1990s led to Lima merging with Rivarossi, Arnold, and Jouef. When these consolidations failed and operations ceased in 2004, Hornby Railways acquired Lima's assets. As of mid 2006, a range of these products has been made available under the Hornby International brand, refitted with NEM couplings and sprung buffers and sockets for DCC decoders. Lima also had a popular OO gauge range much like Hornby, which strengthened the case for acquisition.|$|E

On April 12, France asked that its indemnity be used to reopen a defunct Sino-French Bank. Italy signed an agreement on October 1 to spend its share on the construction of steel bridges. The Netherlands' share paid for harbor and land reclamation, and the Belgian funds were earmarked to be spent on <b>railway</b> <b>material</b> in Belgium. Finally, Japan's indemnity was transferred to develop aviation in China under Japanese oversight ...|$|E

60|$|By {{the middle}} of April the {{concentration}} on the frontier was completed. The communications were cleared of their human freight, and occupied only by supplies and <b>railway</b> <b>material,</b> which continued to pour south at the utmost capacity of the transport. Eleven thousand troops had been massed at and beyond Wady Halfa. But no serious operations could take place until a strong reserve of stores had been accumulated at the front. Meanwhile the army waited, and the railway grew steadily. The battalions were distributed in three principal fortified camps--Halfa, Sarras, and Akasha--and detachments held the chain of small posts which linked them together.|$|E
6000|$|... "The only wonder to me is," [...] {{another officer}} said, [...] "that the Boers {{did not take}} up and drag away the rails {{all the way from}} here to Estcourt. If they had lifted them out of their sleepers, they had only to harness a rail behind each horse and trot off with it. I {{know that there is a}} {{considerable}} amount of <b>railway</b> <b>material</b> at Durban, but I doubt if there is anything like sufficient to make twenty miles of road. And the business would have been still more difficult if the Boers had collected the sleepers in great piles and burned them. Of course they have destroyed a good many culverts and the bridge at Estcourt. It is wonderful that the railway people should have managed to get up a temporary trestle bridge so soon, and to make a deviation of the line to carry the trains over. It does their engineers immense credit. This pass is widening," [...] he added after putting his head out of the window. [...] "I fancy we shall be at Chieveley in a few minutes." ...|$|E
60|$|The aspect {{and history}} of the town and port of Suakin might afford a useful {{instance}} to a cynical politician. Most of the houses stand on a small barren island which is connected with the mainland by a narrow causeway. At a distance the tall buildings of white coral, often five storeys high, present an imposing appearance, and the prominent chimneys of the condensing machinery--for there is scarcely any fresh water--seem to suggest manufacturing activity. But a nearer view reveals the melancholy squalor of the scene. A large part of the town is deserted. The narrow streets wind among tumbled-down and neglected houses. The quaintly carved projecting windows of the facades are boarded up. The soil exhales an odour of stagnation and decay. The atmosphere is rank with memories of waste and failure. The scenes that meet the eye intensify these impressions. The traveller who lands on Quarantine Island is first confronted with the debris of the projected Suakin-Berber Railway. Two or three locomotives that have neither felt the pressure of steam nor tasted oil for a decade lie rusting in the ruined workshops. Huge piles of <b>railway</b> <b>material</b> rot, unguarded and neglected, on the shore. Rolling stock of all kinds--carriages, trucks, vans, and ballast waggons--are strewn or heaped near the sheds. The Christian cemetery alone shows a decided progress, and the long lines of white crosses which mark the graves of British soldiers and sailors who lost their lives in action or by disease during the various campaigns, no less than the large and newly enclosed areas to meet future demands, increase the depression of the visitor. The numerous graves of Greek traders--a study of whose epitaphs may conveniently refresh a classical education--protest that the climate of the island is pestilential. The high loopholed walls declare that the desolate scrub of the mainland is inhabited only by fierce and valiant savages who love their liberty.|$|E
