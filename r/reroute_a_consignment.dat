40|$|Consignment {{contracts}} {{have been}} widely employed in many industries. Under such contracts, items are sold at a retailer's but the supplier retains the full ownership of the inventory until purchased by consumers; the supplier collects payment from the retailer based on actual units sold. We investigate how competition among retailers influences the supply chain decisions and profits under different <b>consignment</b> arrangements, namely <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> price contract and <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> contract with revenue share. First, we investigate how these two <b>consignment</b> contracts and <b>a</b> price only contract compare {{from the perspective of}} each supply chain partner. We find that the retailers benefit more from <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> price contract than from <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> contract with revenue share or a price only contract, regardless of the level of retailer differentiation. The supplier's most beneficial contact, however, critically depends upon the level of retailer differentiation: <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> contract with revenue share is preferable for the supplier if retailer differentiation is strong; otherwise <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> price contract is preferable. Second, we study how retailer differentiation affects the profits of all supply chain partners. We find that less retailer differentiation improves the supplier's profit for both types of consignment contract. Moreover, less retailer differentiation improves profits of the retailers in <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> price contract, but not necessarily in <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> contract with revenue share.

An architecture of BNs which is able {{to be used for}} sampling from small and large consignments is outlined in detail. Through direct interaction with their users, the proposed models provide a framework that is capable of dealing with several distinct sampling issues, such as (i) the calculation of posterior probability distributions for the proportion of ‘positives’ (i. e. discrete units with a characteristic of interest) in <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> {{as well as for the}} number of positives among <b>a</b> <b>consignment’s</b> uninspected items, (ii) case preassessment and (iii) likelihood-ratio evaluation. A discussion is included on features of the proposed models that allow one to account for further complications such as competing prior beliefs about the proportion of positives in <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> and potentially misclassified data (e. g. positive testing results obtained from units that are actually negative) ...|$|R
