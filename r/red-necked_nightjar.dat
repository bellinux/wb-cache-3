We found significant age-related growth in wing, tail and body mass, first-year birds being heavier than adults. Adults showed {{sex differences in}} tail and wing lengths, {{and the size of}} tail and wing spots differed between males and females of all age classes. There was not any difference in the number of wing spots, and juvenile males had a lower number of tail spots than older males. An age-related increase in sexual dimorphism was found to exist by size increase of wing spots in males. Since wing and tail spots are exhibited in courtship displays, the elongation of these secondary sexual characters could be related to mate choice mechanisms. © 1995 Verlag der Deutschen Ornithologen-Gesellschaft.

Because all three species coexist closely on unpaved roads in Do nana National Park (Spain), we predicted that nightjars would experience increased predation risk during periods of high fox and low rabbit abundances. Birds could then modify their space use at a broad scale by moving away from risky unpaved roads or, at a finer scale, by seeking foraging microsites facilitating escape from attacks.

40|$|Prey are {{typically}} assumed to avoid their predators. However, habitat selection patterns of prey might depend upon {{their ability to}} use particular landscape elements to manage their escape options from predator encounters. During two breeding seasons, I studied habitat use and behaviour of <b>red-necked</b> <b>nightjars</b> (Caprimulgus ruficollis) foraging under the risk of predation by red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in southwestern Spain. Nightjars exhibited nearly invariable foraging site choice and body positioning behaviour based on the architecture of vegetation near foraging sites. Nightjars actively chose to sit 120 cm-tall shrubs or trees while facing away from vegetation cover. Vegetation behind nightjars significantly increased their aerial escape opportunities from terrestrial attacks during their peak activity period, when nightjars reveal visible feather bands during their foraging sallies {{from the ground and}} their cryptic colouration may not always match the background. Spatial overlap of nightjars and foxes along roads suggests that microhabitat selection by these birds may in part depend on the chance of escape from predator encounters rather than on the probability of encountering predators. I conclude that the interplay between high escape efficiency and visibility have probably contributed to the evolution of foraging site selection by caprimulgids using bare grounds and cattle, horse and camel trails as the natural counterpart of roads.

Here we estimate annual survival rates of adult <b>Red-necked</b> <b>Nightjars</b> Caprimulgus ruficollis in and around the Doiiana National Park, southwest Spain. During the period 1989 - 95, 557 adults were marked and 19. 7 % of them were recaptured at least once in subsequent years. Capture-recapture models were built t o estimate separately survival and recapture probabilities. The final selected model showed that probabilities of recapture differed between years (0. 06 - 0. 30) but not between sexes, and were independent of recapture effort. Survival was dependent on the interaction between sex and rainfall, this effect being negative for females and positive for males. However, it is not clear why rainfall influences the survival of males and females differentially {{due to the lack of}} accurate information on other life history traits. Average adult survival for the whole period was 0. 74 for males (95 % CI: 0. 63 - 0. 82) and 0. 64 for females (95 % CI: 0. 56 - 0. 72).

40|$|Capsule Red-necked Nightjars' (Caprimulgus ruficollis) {{choice of}} road surface type is {{significantly}} affected by air temperature, which {{may lead to}} increased traffic-induced mortality under cool weather conditions. Aims To assess how seasonality and weather conditions affect road surface use by <b>Red-necked</b> <b>Nightjars</b> and, if so, to identify possible patterns in human-induced mortality {{as a result of}} Nightjars' decisions. Methods In 2009 - 2011, the number of sitting birds were counted along gravel and paved roads in southwestern Spain to evaluate environmental correlates of surface use by Nightjars. Thermal benefits from using each surface type were determined based on local weather data, while seasonality in road casualty rates was assessed at the regional scale. Results Nightjars' occurrence on roads varied seasonally with the nature of the surface. Nightjars' decisions were significantly affected by the thermal regime, with birds being attracted towards the warmth of paved roads during migration, when cool weather (< 20 °C) usually prevailed, or at low temperatures (< 14 °C). Paved roads provided birds with a significantly warmer substrate than nearby gravelled or sandy areas. However, traffic-induced mortality significantly increased when surface use shifted from gravel to paved roads. Conclusion Plasticity in surface choice presumably helps Nightjars to minimize thermoregulatory costs during adverse weather conditions, although the adaptive value of thermal-related decisions appears to incur mortality costs for Nightjar populations. © 2013 British Trust for Ornithology.

Based on habitat use by radiotagged nightjars, we created maps of functional heterogeneity in both areas so that the movements of breeding individuals could be modeled using least-cost path analyses. In both the natural and the managed area, nightjars used remnants of native shrublands as nesting sites, while pinewood patches (either newly planted or natural mature) and roads were selected as roosting and foraging habitats, respectively. Although the fraction of functional habitat was held relatively constant (60. 9 % vs. 74. 1 % in the natural and the managed area, respectively), landscape configuration changed noticeably. As a result, least-cost routes (summed linear distances) from nest locations to the nearest roost and foraging sites were three times larger in the natural than in the managed area (mean ± SE: 1356 ± 76 m vs. 439 ± 32 m). It {{seems likely that the}} increased proximity of functional habitats in the managed area relative to the natural one is underlying the significantly higher abundances of nightjars observed therein, where breeders should travel shorter distances to link together essential resources, thus likely reducing their energy expenditure and mortality risks. Our results suggest that landscape configuration, but not habitat availability, is responsible for the observed differences between the natural and the managed area in the abundance and movements of breeding nightjars, although no effect on body condition was detected. Agricultural landscapes could be moderately managed to preserve small native remnants and to favor the juxtaposition of functional habitats to benefit those farm species relying on patchy resources...|$|E

40|$|Increasing land-use {{intensification}} {{in recent}} decades {{has led to the}} loss and subdivision of large pristine areas, which generally affects species' presence and abundance. However, not every species responds equally to land-use changes: vulnerability of species to landscape transformation may be conditional on their degree of plasticity in habitat use. To assess the behavioural modifications that enable bird populations to persist after landscape management, we compared habitat selection patterns of <b>Red-necked</b> <b>Nightjars</b> (Caprimulgus ruficollis) in two close (10 km) but contrastingly-managed areas in southwestern Spain. Macro-scale analyses showed that nightjar activity (i. e. nesting, roosting and foraging) was dependent on land cover type. In both the unmanaged and the managed area, open shrublands were positively selected as nesting habitat, whereas pinewood patches in the unmanaged area were replaced by pine tree plantations as roosting habitats in the managed property. Individuals in both areas used paved and unpaved roads as the main foraging habitat. Nevertheless, marshlands and lowlands in the unmanaged area were replaced by irrigated fruit tree plantations as secondary foraging habitats in the managed property. The micro-scale analysis showed that nightjars in the unmanaged site sat preferentially nearby autochthonous Juniperus phoenicea trees to hawk flying insects in short upward sallies from the ground, whereas birds commonly used tall dense exotic trees (e. g. Acacia saligna, Nicotiana galuca, Casuarina equisetifolia) in the managed property. Based on similarities in body condition of nightjars and on their greater abundance in the managed area compared to the unmanaged site, we conclude that species tolerant to anthropogenic alterations (i. e. having high plasticity in habitat choice) could to some extent cope with or even benefit from moderate landscape transformation...|$|R
40|$|Landscape {{change can}} expose {{individuals}} to rapidly changing conditions, and thus may accelerate phenotypic divergence among populations. However, the spatial scale at which phenotypic change can occur remains poorly understood. Here, {{we used a}} 5 -year (2008 - 2012) database to examine morphological differentiation and site fidelity of <b>red-necked</b> <b>nightjars</b> (Caprimulgus ruficollis) breeding in two nearby (10 km) habitats subjected to contrasting management practices: a mosaic landscape of cattle-grazed pastures and tree plantations and a protected reserve where human access and activities are restricted. We also quantified the potential foraging opportunities for nightjars at both sites, measured by aerial prey abundance, availability of foraging habitats and their proximity to nesting sites. Nightjars were not randomly distributed with respect to morphology. Breeding birds from the managed area were significantly larger (keel length) than those from the natural reserve, whereas {{there were no differences}} in wing or tail length. No individual (out of 1, 130 captures overall) moved between habitats over the study period, indicating strong site fidelity. Food availability was similar in both habitats, but the availability of foraging sites and their proximity to nesting sites were found to be highest in the managed property, which likely translated into enhanced access to food in the latter area. Taken together, our results suggest that landscape change underlines the observed fine-scale variation in nightjar morphology, since the increased proximity between foraging and nesting sites in the managed area leads to increased food intake and growth rates of nestlings and, as a result, they likely attain larger adult sizes in relation to those in the natural site. High site fidelity probably contributes to maintain the body-size differences between the two habitats. These results come on top recent studies highlighting the role of habitat alteration by humans in promoting population differentiation, even at very small spatial scale...|$|R
40|$|Landscape change {{provides}} a suitable framework for investigating population-level responses to novel ecological pressures. However, relatively {{little attention has}} been paid to examine the potential influence of landscape change on the geographic scale of population differentiation. Here, we tested for morphological differentiation of <b>red-necked</b> <b>nightjars</b> Caprimulgus ruficollis breeding in a managed property and a natural reserve situated less than 10 km apart. At both sites, we also estimated site fidelity over 5 years and quantified the potential foraging opportunities for nightjars. Breeding birds in the managed habitat were significantly larger in size—as indexed by keel length—than those in the natural one. However, there were no significant differences in wing or tail length. Immigration from neighboring areas was almost negligible and, furthermore, no individual (out of 1130 captures overall) exchanged habitats between years, indicating strong site fidelity. Food supply for nightjars was equally abundant in both habitats, but the availability of foraging sites was remarkably higher in the managed property. As a result, nightjars—particularly fledglings— in the latter habitat benefited from increased foraging opportunities in relation to those in the natural site. It seems likely that the fine-scale variation in nightjar morphology reflects a phenotypic response to unequal local conditions, since non-random dispersal or differential mortality had been determined not to be influential. High site fidelity appears to contribute to the maintenance of body-size differences between the two habitats. Results from this nightjar population highlight the potential of human-induced landscape change to promote population-level responses at exceedingly small geographic scales.
