60|$|As to {{that popular}} humor {{which is the}} medium we float in, if I can discern {{anything}} at all of its present state, it is far worse than I have ever known or could ever imagine it. The faults {{of the people are}} not popular vices; at least, they are not such as grow out of what we used to take to be the English temper and character. The greatest number have a sort of an heavy, lumpish acquiescence in government, without much respect or esteem for those that compose it. I really cannot avoid making some very unpleasant prognostics from this disposition of the people. I think that many of the symptoms must have struck you: I will mention one or two that are to me very remarkable. You must know that at Bristol we grow, as an election interest, and even as a party interest, rather stronger than we were when I was chosen. We have just now a majority in the corporation. In this state of matters, what, think you, have they done? They have voted their freedom to Lord Sandwich and Lord Suffolk!--to the first, at the very moment when the American privateers were domineering in the Irish Sea, and taking the Bristol traders in the Bristol Channel;--to the latter, when his remonstrances on the subject of captures were the jest of Paris and of Europe. This fine step was taken, it seems, in honor of the zeal of these two profound statesmen in the prosecution of John the Painter: so totally negligent are they of everything essential, and so long and so deeply affected with trash the most low and contemptible; just as if they thought the merit of Sir John Fielding was the most shining point in the character of great ministers, in the most critical of all times, and, of all others, the most deeply interesting to the commercial world! My best friends in the corporation had no other doubts on the occasion than whether it did not belong to me, by right of my <b>representative</b> <b>capacity,</b> to be the bearer of this auspicious compliment. In addition to this, if it could receive any addition, they now employ me to solicit, as a favor of no small magnitude, that, after the example of Newcastle, they may be suffered to arm vessels for their own defence in the Channel. Their memorial, under the seal of Merchants' Hall, is now lying on the table before me. Not a soul has the least sensibility, on finding themselves, now for the first time, obliged to act as if the community were dissolved, and, after enormous payments towards the common protection, each part was to defend itself, {{as if it were a}} separate state.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we provide a formal {{analysis}} {{of the idea of}} normative co-ordination. We argue that this idea {{is based on the assumption}} that agents can achieve flexible co-ordination by conferring normative positions to other agents. These positions include duties, permissions, and powers. In particular, we explain the idea of declarative power, which consists in the capacity of the power-holder of creating normative positions, involving other agents, simply by “proclaiming ” such positions. In addition, we account also for the concepts of representation, namely the <b>representative’s</b> <b>capacity</b> of acting in the name of his principal, and of mandate, which is the mandatee’s duty to act as the mandator has requested. Finally, we show how the framework can be applied to represent the contract-net protocol. Some brief remarks on future research and applications conclude this contribution.

50|$|However, {{the rights}} and {{obligations}} of any third party holder of the assets shall remain subject to the law determined by the choice of law rules of the lex fori. Thus, although the Convention makes provision for the trustee(s) and any third parties, it fails to address {{the position of the}} beneficiaries who, for example, might wish to pursue assets intermixed with the trustee's personal property through actions for tracing. One of the problems that beneficiaries might encounter is addressed in Article 12 which considers the problem where the situs law does not have a title registration system which reflects ownership registration in a <b>representative</b> <b>capacity.</b> While recognising that the Convention cannot require states to modify their existing registers, it provides that the trustee shall be entitled, in so far as this is not prohibited by or inconsistent with the law of the State where registration is sought, to do so in his capacity as trustee or in such other way that the existence of the trust is disclosed. This implicitly recognises the desirability of all registration systems distinguishing between beneficial and representative titles.|$|E
5000|$|The English rule used to {{distinguish}} {{between public and private}} waters was based on the limit of the tide, for those waters that were navigable were subject to admiralty jurisdiction. In the U.S., this rule had been extended to include navigable fresh water [...] "reasonably capable of valuable use as a public way." [...] However, it was not always clear that a pond - isolated from the ocean or a navigable river, but otherwise in the public domain - was reserved for public use. Furthermore, the ability to hunt and fish on public lands had been denied to citizens during feudal times, and that [...] "system of legal inequality in the enjoyment of public property" [...] was precisely what the colonists sought to avoid. Thus, a new rule defining public waters needed to be established that was not based on the navigability of the waters.By the English rule thus modified, the legal title of New Hampshire land was in the king, who held it as trustee in his official and <b>representative</b> <b>capacity,</b> with no private interest. The dry land, and the soil under fresh rivers, brooks, and small ponds, was convertible, by his grant, into private property, for settlement, and for the advancement of the common welfare. The seashore, arms of the sea, and large ponds, by reason of their special adaptation to public uses, were set apart and reserved as public waters. They could not be converted into private estate or subjected to a private easement, by the trustee's grant, or by any act of the executive branch of the government. The distinction is between what the trustee held for public use and what he held for the purpose of sale or other appropriation to private use for the public benefit.In 1647 the want of a definition of “great ponds” was supplied,[...] [...] that no town shall appropriate to any particular person or persons any great pond containing more than ten acres of land, and that no man shall come upon another's propriety sic without their leave.|$|E
