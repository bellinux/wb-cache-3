5|$|The Fringe team {{is brought}} to a nursing home, where Roscoe Joyce (Christopher Lloyd), the former keyboardist of the band Violet Sedan Chair, was seen talking to his son Bobby (Nick Ouellette) {{who had died in}} 1985, as well as {{evidence}} of an Observer. Walter Bishop (John Noble), meeting his musical hero, requests to take Roscoe back to his lab to help Roscoe remember what his son said. Walter is able to help Roscoe <b>remember</b> <b>much</b> of his past since the loss of his son through therapy that includes helping Roscoe to recall his piano-playing skills. Roscoe shortly recalls the conversation with his son, which was actually a message from the Observer September to Walter. September (Michael Cerveris) soon appears at the lab and requests to speak to Walter.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Dales, an {{assistant}} constable, arrived from Birmingham, {{where he was}} one of those responsible for policing the town. On ascertaining the situation he interrogated Thornton, and soon arrested him. However, Dales did not keep any notes and later proved unable to <b>remember</b> <b>much</b> of what the prisoner told him. Thornton was then examined by the local magistrate, William Bedford, who ordered Thornton searched. The search revealed that Thornton was wearing underclothing with bloodstains, and Thornton admitted having sexual intercourse with Ashford the previous night. The prisoner's shoes were removed, and comparisons with the footprints in the field were made by the factory workers, who later testified at trial that they matched. A post-mortem examination revealed that Ashford died from drowning, and that the only marks on her body were two lacerations in the genital area. The examination concluded that until the sexual act which caused the bleeding, Ashford was a virgin. She was menstruating at the time of her death.|$|E
25|$|Some time later, Japp phones Poirot {{and tells}} him Winnie has been found about fifteen miles from Amiens. She is in a daze, has been doped {{according}} to the doctor who examined her, and is unable to <b>remember</b> <b>much</b> after setting off from her home town of Cranchester. She remembers nothing of meeting one of Miss Pope's staff, Miss Burshaw, in London before the trip to France. Despite the girl being found, Poirot speaks with Detective Inspector Hearn, who has been dealing with the case and is no nearer to solving the mystery of how the girl disappeared. The only {{other people in the}} carriage seemed clear of suspicion – two middle-aged spinsters, two French commercial travellers from Lyon, a young man called James Elliot and his flashy wife, and an American lady about whom very little is known. He is able to confirm that Winnie's shoes were found by the rail line which confirms Poirot's theory.|$|E

When {{asked about her}} background, Montour told Marshe {{that she had been}} born in Canada to a French father. She said that she had been captured by the Iroquois about fifty years earlier (i.e. around 1694), when she was about ten years old, and that she did not <b>remember</b> <b>much</b> about her parents. She had been adopted and raised by the Iroquois, she said. She eventually married Carondawana, an Oneida war chief, with whom she had several children before his death in battle in 1729.|$|E
2500|$|The largely unenthusiastic press {{reaction}} to the album caused the individual members of the band to lose faith {{in the concept of}} an ongoing, periodic series of band reunions and ultimately, all five members returned to their own careers following the album's release. [...] In the following years, the band themselves would echo many of the sentiments expressed by the music press, with the general consensus being that the recording of the album was rushed and ill-thought out. [...] Gene Clark offered his thoughts on the album during a 1977 interview: [...] "I am disappointed in that album. Some of the harsh criticism is unjust, because, if you listen to it carefully, the album isn't that bad, but it just hasn't got the punch that it could have had if we'd taken the time." [...] Chris Hillman concurred with Clark, telling The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan [...] "In all honesty, we didn't have enough time on the album. They gave us one-and-a-half months to do that album, expecting guys to regroup after a five to six year absence." [...] Hillman also cited the band's eagerness to avoid conflict as a contributing factor to the album's artistic failure: [...] "everybody was so afraid of stepping on the other person's feet because of the tension that had gone down six years prior to that, that it became a bland album. Everybody was being too nice to each other." [...] McGuinn blamed the reunion album's lack of success, at least partly, on the hedonism exhibited by members of the band during the recording process: [...] "David had this incredibly strong pot. Half a joint and you couldn't do anything. We were stoned out of our minds the whole time. I don't <b>remember</b> <b>much</b> recording." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{time after}} {{getting up and}} being {{attended}} to again by the aforementioned personnel, TV cameras showed a lingering shot of Foley smiling through his profusely bleeding mouth and lips, with a loose tooth hanging beneath his nose; the tooth having been knocked out due to being struck by the chair which had fallen through the cage and landed on his face, dislocating his jaw. Foley was actually trying to show {{a hole in his}} bottom lip by sticking his tongue through it, but it could not be seen clearly through his beard. The match continued for a while longer, ending with Foley receiving the Tombstone Piledriver after being slammed by The Undertaker onto hundreds of thumbtacks, which Foley himself had strewn onto the ring canvas. Although Foley lost, both wrestlers received a standing ovation for the match, and the event is often said to have jump-started Foley's main event career (Foley has said that although this match grew in legend, the reality was that his career remained [...] "somewhat sluggish" [...] for sometime afterwards until Foley further developed the Mankind character, and fans began to catch on). Many future matches attempted to replicate some of the spots from this match. In his autobiography Have a Nice Day! A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks, Foley wrote that he could not <b>remember</b> <b>much</b> of what happened, and he had to watch a tape of the match to write about it. The match was voted Pro Wrestling Illustrateds Match of the Year for 1998. Although many fans regard the match as a classic, it has generated controversy as well. Critics charge that the falls in the match were so extreme and they set the bar for further bumps so high that the inevitable attempts to equal or surpass them would be very dangerous for any wrestlers involved.|$|E

[...] Going to describe the film as a [...] "bit of a mess", although it [...] "raises a few laughs". Alison Rowat called Magicians [...] "an hour of OK telly trying to pass as a film", and gave it two stars. This assessment was shared by Leslie Felperin of Variety, who saw it as an [...] "attenuated TV episode", with only [...] "mildly amusing results", that was not as funny as Peep Show. Stuart McGurk gave a negative review, citing that [...] "for a much-anticipated film, {{this is a huge}} let-down", and that it lacks [...] "the eclectic off-key cruelty and spot-on zingers of the much-revered Peep Show", although he did say that the film [...] "still has the odd good line", but concluded by saying that anyone [...] "expecting anything else will be sorely disappointed". The Guardians Phelim O'Neill gave Magicians two stars, calling it [...] "Peep Show the sequel", and stated that [...] "O'Connor's direction has absolutely zero visual flair, making the performers' transition from television to film rather pointless." [...] The Times Dominic Maxwell decided that [...] "Magicians doesn't have the brio (or great gags), let alone the marketability, of a Bridget Jones." [...] Caroline Westbrook gave the film three stars, and gave it an even review, stating that [...] "There's a lot to like about Magicians, especially if you're a fan of Mitchell and Webb", although it [...] "ultimately feels as though it's lacking something". She concluded that [...] "It's a perfectly agreeable way to while away {{an hour and a half}} - but don't expect to <b>remember</b> <b>much</b> about it in the morning." [...] Digital Spy gave the film a positive review, and three stars concluding that [...] "A must for magic and Peep Show fans alike, with some original and brilliant comedy moments." ...|$|E
