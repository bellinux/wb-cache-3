5|$|Much of Alvarado's trial {{focused on}} whether Alvarado was in custody or not during his police interview. According to Thompson v. Keohane, to {{determine}} whether someone is in custody the courts apply a <b>reasonable</b> person test: whether a <b>reasonable</b> person would have felt free to leave or not.|$|E
5|$|A person {{inside or}} outside a {{security}} area who knows or has <b>reasonable</b> cause to believe that another person has committed an offence under Part III of the ISA, or has information about the present or intended movements or whereabouts of another person whom he or she knows or has <b>reasonable</b> cause to believe to be a terrorist, but who fails to report the matter to a police officer, commits an offence punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years. However, if the person voluntarily gives full information to a police officer before being accused of or charged with an offence, {{he or she will}} not be convicted.|$|E
5|$|All {{time spent}} {{providing}} a breath sample or urine specimen, including travel time {{to and from}} the collection site, to comply with the random, <b>reasonable</b> suspicion, post-accident, or follow-up drug testing.|$|E
5|$|Although Herbert {{asserts that}} the many-worlds {{interpretation}} lacks the counterfactual definiteness required to prove Bell's theorem, he contends that the many-worlds view is inherently non-local, by any <b>reasonable</b> conception of locality.|$|E
5|$|Any {{married person}} who alleges that <b>reasonable</b> grounds exist for supposing {{that the other}} party to the {{marriage}} is dead may apply to court to have it presumed that the other party is dead {{and to have the}} marriage dissolved. If the court is satisfied that such <b>reasonable</b> grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has {{no reason to believe that}} the other party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E
5|$|At any time, {{the police}} may order a new health {{clearance}} inspection {{if they have}} a <b>reasonable</b> concern that the person is not healthy enough to continue holding their license.|$|E
5|$|Due process {{prohibits the}} {{prosecution}} from knowingly using falsehood to convict the defendant, and requires reversal {{if there is}} a <b>reasonable</b> likelihood that the verdict was affectedwhether the falsehood is inculpatory or goes the credibility of a witness.|$|E
5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is <b>reasonable</b> foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used <b>reasonable</b> care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected to avoid it.|$|E
5|$|Freedom to {{assemble}} peacefully without arms {{on which the}} State can impose <b>reasonable</b> restrictions {{in the interest of}} public order and the sovereignty and integrity of India.|$|E

5|$|If {{a chamber}} is not {{available}} for recompression within a <b>reasonable</b> period, a riskier alternative is in-water recompression at the dive site.|$|E
5|$|If {{pregnancy}} {{is a high}} concern using two methods {{at the same time}} is <b>reasonable,</b> and two forms of birth control is recommended in those taking the anti-acne drug isotretinoin, due to the high risk of birth defects if taken during pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, the object of the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a <b>reasonable</b> means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it is <b>reasonable,</b> taking into consideration the object of the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute. The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|Interested {{parties on}} both sides filed amici. A group of {{conservative}} Republicans {{in both houses of}} Congress, including Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Henry Hyde and Rick Santorum, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children both argued for affirming the conviction, pointing to the invaluable nature of undercover investigations in fighting child pornography, worrying that requiring <b>reasonable</b> suspicion beforehand could make such operations impossible. Americans for Effective Law Enforcement said there had been no entrapment and that <b>reasonable</b> suspicion was not required before starting investigations such as Looking Glass. The American Civil Liberties Union, its Nebraska chapter and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers weighed in on Jacobson's behalf.|$|E
5|$|Light goods {{vehicles}} without transponders {{are assessed}} an additional Video Toll. Motorcycles are not charged a video toll {{because there is}} rarely a <b>reasonable</b> place to mount a transponder.|$|E

5|$|On October 13, 2008, the DTI ordered ABS-CBN {{to pay an}} {{administrative}} fine of ₱290,000, ruling that the Wilyonaryo segment violated the Consumers Act of the Philippines, ruling that “A <b>reasonable</b> assessment of the existing game mechanics and procedures reveals that the game show segment allowed for <b>reasonable</b> likelihood of error and provided the host and organizers significant latitude in controlling {{the outcome of the}} contest.” ABS-CBN later released a statement that they would file an appeal on the decision.|$|E
5|$|Released on June 25, 1996, <b>Reasonable</b> Doubt {{peaked at}} number 23 on the Billboard 200. It spent 18 {{weeks on the}} chart, and 55 weeks on the Billboard Top R/Hip-Hop Albums, on which it reached number three. By the end of 1996, it had sold 420,000 copies in the United States.

5|$|The {{crux of the}} High Court's holding {{rested on}} stage 3(b), as {{illustrated}} in the table below. In analysing {{the constitutionality of the}} provision with regards to this portion of the <b>reasonable</b> classification test, the Court first ascertained the object of section 37(1) of the PCA. It subsequently considered if differentiation on the basis of citizenship was a <b>reasonable</b> means of attaining the objective.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} may not detain an individual even momentarily without <b>reasonable</b> and articulable suspicion, {{with a few}} exceptions. In Delaware v. Prouse (1979), the Court ruled an officer has made an illegal seizure when he stops an automobile and detains the driver in order to check his driver's license and the registration of the automobile, unless the officer has articulable and <b>reasonable</b> suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered, or either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law.|$|E
5|$|The oceanographic {{research}} voyage {{known as the}} Challenger Expedition, 1872–76, explored Antarctic waters for several weeks, but did not approach the land itself; its research, however, proved {{the existence of an}} Antarctic continent beyond <b>reasonable</b> doubt.|$|E

5|$|When {{appealing}} the District Court's decision, {{the government}} did not argue that there was <b>reasonable</b> suspicion. Instead, the government argued that the border search doctrine supported both the initial search and the transportation of the laptop to Tucson for examination.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{the basis}} of {{differentiation}} bears a <b>reasonable</b> relation to {{the object of the}} statute.|$|E
5|$|Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote a {{concurrence}} that {{agreed with}} {{the finding that the}} state court's decision was <b>reasonable.</b> However, O'Connor held that there could be cases in which age would be relevant to custody analysis. This would be affirmed by the Court in 2011 in J.D.B. v. North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing {{has also}} been {{implemented}} in urban freeways. Between 2004 and 2005, Santiago de Chile implemented the first 100% non-stop urban toll for a freeway passing through a downtown area, charging by the distance traveled.
