40|$|Aim: To {{identify}} {{where and}} why delays occur in Uganda blood banks. Background: The timely provision and supply of safe and efficacious blood components to hospitals depends on sound {{systems in the}} processing blood banks. Poorly managed systems lead to apparent blood shortages in hospitals and increase discard rates due to expiry before dispatch. Materials and methods: We reviewed records of 4126 units of whole blood delivered by the mobile collection teams to a major regional blood bank, in the period 1 March 2009 to 30 June 2009, to ascertain the time intervals between the critical steps in the blood processing chain. This was followed by interviews with staff in two blood banks to establish the causes of process delays. Results: The average duration between blood collection and final labelling (<b>release</b> <b>from</b> <b>quarantine</b> for final storage) was 15. 4 (SD 10. 8) days. In timeline, the step between matrix generation and grouping was (median duration 8 days) the longest, whereas grouping to labelling was the shortest (median duration 2 days). Blood expiry had the highest discard rate (0. 17 %) among the non-transfusion transmissible infection marker causes. A minimally facilitated small staff contributed to the process flaws. Conclusion: A considerable amount of blood does not reach hospitals because of process delays between collection and ultimate dispatch. This {{is caused by a}} thin staff working with inadequate materials, out-of-date methods and in an overcrowded environment. Provision of adequate staff and improved financial allocations to the Uganda Blood Transfusion Services will mitigate this situation...|$|E
40|$|European wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are {{frequently}} translocated for hunting and conservation purposes. Quarantining these animals prior to release {{reduces the risk}} of releasing rabbits incubating field infec- tions of myxomatosis or viral haemorrhagic disease (RHD), and it provides a way to vaccinate these animals against both diseases. However the optimal quarantine period needed to achieve these goals is not known. We therefore assessed the effects of quarantine lengths (2, 4, 6, 8 weeks) on rabbit biochemical parameters, immunity induced by vaccination against myxomatosis and RHD, and survival of translocated rabbits. We found that levels of total bilirubin, urea nitrogen, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzymatic activi- ties were significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased during quarantine, independently of quarantine length, whereas haematocrit levels increased significantly. All pregnant female rabbits aborted or lost litters during quarantine. Seroconversion against myxomatosis and RHD following vaccination was not related to any biochemical parame- ter at vaccination time, but the proportion of seronegative rabbits that seroconverted was moderate. The het- erophil/lymphocyte ratio, conjugated to unconjugated bilirubin ratio, and the serum AST and creatinine levels we measured after capture and transport were directly related to mortality through the quarantine period, whereas we found total serum protein level was negatively related to mortality. Mortality after release was positively related to urea nitrogen concentration and negatively related to haematocrit and the albumin/globulin ratio, but it was independent of quarantine length. Based on our findings, rabbit translocation programs that include a quarantine period could be improved by decreasing the acute stress induced by capture and handling prior to quarantine; facilitating a more rapid access to high quality feed during quarantine; and improving the vaccination protocol. In addition the <b>release</b> <b>from</b> <b>quarantine</b> of rabbits should be determined by their physical condition, not merely by elapsed time in quarantine. Peer reviewe...|$|E

This is an {{open access}} article {{distributed}} under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. There is no European legislation concerning paratuberculosis that requires that imported animals be kept in quarantine and commonly they are directly released into areas with other animals. In this study, detection of latent infection of paratuberculosis in healthy mouflons previously diagnosed as paratuberculosis-free, but originating from a real time quantitative PCR- (qPCR-) positive herd, occurred after their transport to a new farm. During a twelve-day quarantine period, all mouflons irregularly shed Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) in faeces, and in {{a small number of}} cases also in milk. After the animals were <b>released</b> <b>from</b> <b>quarantine,</b> MAP was detected for a further two days, after which, testing was negative, except in one case. Therefore, the stress connected with transport, novel environment, dietary change, or limited area with high density of animals might have contributed to the induction of paratuberculosis and the shedding of MAP from the animals, previously diagnosed as MAP-negative. According to these results, the keeping of imported animals in quarantine and their examination forMAP presence not only before the transport but also afterwards should be recommended. The designation of a particular area of a farm as a quarantine enclosure could help to mitigate the impact of stress caused by a confined space with a high density of animals. 1...|$|R

To prevent the introduction and spread of new diseases, it is crucial that any imported pathogens are detected before the cane is <b>released</b> <b>from</b> <b>quarantine.</b> Although not present in South Africa, Grassy Shoot (GS) and Sugarcane White Leaf (SCWL) are economically significant phytoplasmal diseases that cause yield loss in sugarcane in a number of countries. Despite phytoplasmas being important pathogens that have been implicated in more than 300 plant diseases worldwide, these organisms have as yet not been cultured in vitro. The most reliable and rapid method of detection has been the use of nested polymerase chain reaction directed to conserved sequences in the 16 S rRNA gene, where DNA isolation follows a phytoplasmal enrichment procedure. The process is both expensive and time consuming. This study investigated the use of FTA TM paper (Whatman BioScience) for DNA extraction, and the use of a radioactive probe in conjunction with a tissue blot procedure to detect phytoplasmas in sugarcane leaf samples exhibiting symptoms of GS and SCWL, and in Bermuda grass leaf samples showing symptoms of Bermuda Grass White Leaf disease. The FTA TM paper method was effective in extracting the DNA from which specific identifications could be made. As well as being more rapid, this method effected a two-thirds reduction in cost compared with the enrichment method.
