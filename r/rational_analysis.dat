Because he had already read widely, Priestley was allowed to skip {{the first two years of}} coursework. He continued his intense study; this, together with the liberal atmosphere of the school, shifted his theology further leftward and he became a Rational Dissenter. Abhorring dogma and religious mysticism, Rational Dissenters emphasised the <b>rational</b> <b>analysis</b> of the natural world and the Bible.|$|E

25|$|From {{the late}} 1940s onwards, Ellis worked on {{rational}} emotive behavioral therapy (REBT), and by January 1953 his break with psychoanalysis was complete, {{and he began}} calling himself a rational therapist. Ellis was now advocating a new more active and directive type of psychotherapy. In 1955, he presented rational therapy (RT). In RT, the therapist sought to help the client understand—and act on the understanding—that his personal philosophy contained beliefs that contributed to his own emotional pain. This new approach stressed actively working to change a client's self-defeating beliefs and behaviours by demonstrating their irrationality, self-defeatism and rigidity. Ellis believed that through <b>rational</b> <b>analysis</b> and cognitive reconstruction, people could understand their self-defeatingness {{in light of their}} core irrational beliefs and then develop more rational constructs.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rational</b> {{expectations}} <b>analysis</b> {{has received}} increasing attention from econ-omists in recent years. Some of this {{attention has been}} evident in papers published in {{the first volume of}} this journal, and at recent control con-ferences sponsored by the Society of Economic Dynamics and Control. That <b>rational</b> expectations <b>analysis</b> has become a frequent topic of research among those interested in the application of methods of dynamic analysis and control to economic problems is natural, in the sense that <b>rational</b> expec-tations <b>analysis</b> depends heavily on such methods. This issue of the JEDC is devoted entirely to rational expectations research with an emphasis on general methodological considerations and policy implications. The idea for such a collection originated with David Kendrick who suggested that it might help to clarify some of the more controversial issues in the field, as well as to indicate which areas are most likely to require additional research. The selection of papers for this issue has reflected these general aims, as discussed below...|$|R
25|$|This {{reflects}} {{the idea that}} workers {{have a vested interest}} in their own well-being, and do not benefit from working above the defined rate of work when it will not increase their remuneration. He therefore proposed that the work practice that had been developed in most work environments was crafted, intentionally or unintentionally, to be very inefficient in its execution. He posited that time and motion studies combined with <b>rational</b> <b>analysis</b> and synthesis could uncover one best method for performing any particular task, and that prevailing methods were seldom equal to these best methods. Crucially, Taylor himself prominently acknowledged that if each employee's compensation was linked to their output, their productivity would go up. Thus his compensation plans usually included piece rates. In contrast, some later adopters of time and motion studies ignored this aspect and tried to get large productivity gains while passing little or no compensation gains to the workforce, which contributed to resentment against the system.|$|E

500|$|According to Sadat, it {{was only}} when the Israelis cut off the Egyptian {{garrison}} at Sharm el-Sheikh that Nasser became aware of the situation's gravity. After hearing of the attack, he rushed to army headquarters to inquire about the military situation. The simmering conflict between Nasser and Amer subsequently came to the fore, and officers present reported the pair burst into [...] "a nonstop shouting match". The Supreme Executive Committee, set up by Nasser to oversee the conduct of the war, attributed the repeated Egyptian defeats to the Nasser–Amer rivalry and Amer's overall incompetence. According to Egyptian diplomat Ismail Fahmi, who became foreign minister during Sadat's presidency, the Israeli invasion and Egypt's consequent defeat was a result of Nasser's dismissal of all <b>rational</b> <b>analysis</b> of the situation and his undertaking of a series of irrational decisions.|$|E

In April 2007, the non-profit conservation group ProFauna Indonesia attracted news coverage with a demonstration held in Malang, Java. The demonstration—an appeal for increased protection for slow lorises—involved organization members suspending themselves from bridges while holding banners that read [...] "Stop jual kukang" [...] ("Stop the slow loris trade") and [...] "Jangan beli kukang" [...] ("Don't buy slow lorises"). From early to mid-June, the 14th CITES Conference of the Parties (CITES COP-14) was held in The Hague, Netherlands. On 8June, Cambodia presented the proposal along with their rationale.

2500|$|A {{study on}} global religiosity, secularity, and {{well-being}} notes {{that it is}} unlikely that most atheists and agnostics base their decision to not believe in the gods on a careful, <b>rational</b> <b>analysis</b> of philosophical and scientific arguments since science testing scores in societies where atheism or theism is widespread, are just as poor and such societies have widespread supernatural beliefs besides gods.. Reviewing psychological studies on atheists, Miguel Farias, noted that studies concluding that analytical thinking leads to lower religious belief [...] "do not imply that that atheists are more conscious or reflective of their own beliefs, or that atheism is the outcome of a conscious refutation of previously held religious beliefs" [...] since they too have variant beliefs such as in conspiracy theories of the naturalistic variety. In terms of apostasy, a greater proportion of people who leave religion, do so for motivational rather than rational reasons and the majority of deconversions occur in adolescence and young adulthood when one is emotionally volatile. Furthermore, Farias notes that atheists are indistinguishable from New Age individuals or Gnostics since there are commonalities such as being individualistic, non-conformist, liberal, and valuing hedonism and sensation. According to Phil Zuckerman, the majority of atheists and other secular people who were raised with a religion, leave their religion and beliefs in their late teens or early twenties while a smaller proportion do so at a mature age.|$|E
2500|$|Although the May Fourth Movement {{did find}} partial success in {{removing}} Chinese traditional culture, {{there were still}} proponents who steadfastly argued that China's traditions and values should be the fundamental foundation of the nation. From these opponents of Western civilization derived three neotraditional schools of thought: national essence, national character, and modern relevance of Confucianism. Each school of thought denounced the western values of individualism, materialism and utilitarianism as inadequate avenues {{for the development of}} China. Each school held to specific objectives. The [...] "national essence" [...] school sought to discover aspects of traditional culture that could potentially serve the national development of China. Such traditional aspects consisted of various philosophical and religious practices that emerged parallel with Confucianism. Most particularly, China imported Buddhism, a religion from their neighboring countries, India and Nepal. Under the [...] "national character" [...] school, advocates promoted the traditional family system, the primary target of the May [...] Fourth Movement. [...] In this school, reformers viewed Westerners as shells without morals. Finally, the modern relevance of Confucianism was centered on the notion that Confucian values were better than Western ones. In response to western culture's primary concentration on <b>rational</b> <b>analysis,</b> China's neotraditionalists argued that this [...] was misguided, especially in the practical, changing milieu of the world.
