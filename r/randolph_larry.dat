40|$|This {{project will}} develop an {{analytical}} tool to calculate performance of HMX based PBXs in the skid test. The skid-test {{is used as}} a means to measure sensitivity for large charges in handling situations. Each series of skid tests requires dozens of drops of large billets. It is proposed that the reaction (or lack of one) of PBXs in the skid test is governed by the mechanical properties of the binder. If true, one might be able to develop an analytical tool to estimate skid test behavior for new PBX formulations. Others over the past 50 years have tried to develop similar models. This project will research and summarize the works of others and couple the work of 3 into an analytical tool that can be run on a PC to calculate drop height of HMX based PBXs. Detonation due to dropping a billet is argued to be a dynamic thermal event. To avoid detonation, the heat created due to friction at impact, must be conducted into the charge or the target faster than the chemical kinetics can create additional energy. The methodology will involve numerically solving the Frank-Kamenetskii equation in one dimension. The analytical problem needs to be bounded in terms of how much heat is introduced to the billet and for how long. Assuming an inelastic collision with no rebound, the billet will be in contact with the target for a short duration determined by the equations of motion. For the purposes of the calculations, it will be assumed that if a detonation is to occur, it will transpire within that time. The surface temperature will be raised according to the friction created using the equations of motion of dropping the billet on a rigid surface. The study will connect the works of Charles Anderson, Alan <b>Randolph,</b> <b>Larry</b> Hatler, Alfonse Popolato, and Charles Mader into a single PC based analytic tool. Anderson's equations of motion will be used to calculate the temperature rise upon impact, the time this temperature is maintained (contact time) will be obtained from the work of Hatler et. al., and the reactive temperature rise will be obtained from Mader's work. Finally, the assessment of when a detonation occurs will be derived from Bowden and Yoffe's thermal explosion theory (hot spot) ...|$|E

50|$|Willie <b>Larry</b> <b>Randolph</b> (born July 6, 1954) is an American former Major League Baseball {{second baseman}} and manager. During an 18-year {{baseball}} career, he played from 1975 to 1992 for six different teams, {{most notably the}} New York Yankees where he won back to back world titles against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He has joined ESPN as a postseason baseball analyst, beginning in September 2013. He will mainly be on Baseball Tonight, and provide updates during Monday and Wednesday night September network telecasts.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{of those}} who shaped the current Apostolic-Prophetic Movement in the United States were based in Kansas City, Missouri and {{became known as the}} [...] "Kansas City Prophets". Members of this group were Bob Jones, Bill Hamon, <b>Larry</b> <b>Randolph,</b> Paul Cain, Mike Bickle, James Goll, John Paul Jackson, and Lou Engle. Cain had participated in the Healing Revival {{initiated}} by William Branham during the 1950s. The surviving members of the Kansas City Prophets continue to be active in ministry throughout North America and often attend - and speak at - charismatic Christian conferences and meetings.|$|R
5000|$|Much of {{the humor}} {{of the series}} derives from the scheming of Captain Parmenter's {{somewhat}} crooked but amiable non-commissioned officers, Sergeant Morgan O'Rourke (Forrest Tucker) and Corporal <b>Randolph</b> Agarn (<b>Larry</b> Storch). They, in league with the local (fictitious) American Indian tribe, the Hekawis—led by Chief Wild Eagle (Frank de Kova), are forever seeking to expand and conceal their shady business deals covertly and collectively referred to as [...] "O'Rourke Enterprises". Initially, rations and pay were drawn for 30 men at Fort Courage, even though only 17 are actually accounted for (the other 13, according to O'Rourke, are Indian scouts who only come to the fort at night and leave before dawn). The pay of the fictitious scouts is apparently used to help finance the dealings of O'Rourke Enterprises. Although O'Rourke and Agarn try {{to take full advantage}} of Captain Parmenter's innocence and naïveté, they are also very fond of and fiercely protective of him, and woe be to anyone attempting to harm him. Parmenter also struggles to exert his authority outside the ranks. Very bashful, he tries to escape the matrimonial plans of his girlfriend, shopkeeper-postmistress Jane Angelica Thrift, known locally as [...] "Wrangler Jane" [...] (Melody Patterson) -- who although only 16 at the time used a forged birth certificate that gave her age was 18, allowing her to be cast in the role -- 4 though he becomes a bit more affectionate toward her during the second season.|$|R
5000|$|Corporal <b>Randolph</b> Agarn (<b>Larry</b> Storch) - <b>Randolph</b> Agarn is O'Rourke's {{somewhat}} dimwitted sidekick {{and business}} {{partner in the}} shady O'Rourke Enterprises (his name is a play on both Randolph Scott and John Agar who were cowboy stars). The character Agarn, originally from Passaic, New Jersey, took six years after enlistment to become a lowly corporal. At {{the time of the}} series, Agarn has been in the cavalry for 10 years, and has been posted to Fort Courage for the last four, apparently spending the Civil War years at Fort Courage. He has impersonated Generals George Washington and Ulysses Grant. However, in dual roles, Storch played numerous lookalike relatives of Agarn, including his French-Canadian cousin Lucky Pierre, his Russian cousin Dmitri Agarnoff and his Mexican bandito cousin Pancho Agarnado, known as [...] "El Diablo." [...] (In the same episode he also played Granny Agarn, Uncle Gaylord Agarn of Tallahassee and Pancho's sister Carmen Agarnado). Confrontational and often overly-emotional in every respect, Agarn frequently collapses in tears with the phrases [...] "Oh, Cap'n!" [...] or [...] "Oh, Sarge!" [...] (depending on whose chest he buries his head in). To get the men to attention, he barks out his trademark loud and exaggerated (but unintelligible) [...] "Aaaaa-aaahh" [...] command. Whenever he becomes frustrated by something one of the troopers does wrong (which is often), short-tempered Agarn hits him with his hat which, unlike everyone else's, is white. A hypochondriac, Agarn thinks he's contracted the illnesses he reads or hears about or others around him have (including a horse). One running gag during the second season involves Agarn's delayed reactions, which usually ran: Agarn would make a suggestion; O'Rourke would respond: [...] "Agarn, I don't know why everyone says you're so dumb!" [...] At the beginning of the next scene (which could be several hours or days after the original comment), Agarn, suddenly indignant, demands: [...] "Who says I'm dumb?" [...] Agarn was briefly promoted to Sergeant in the episode [...] "Lieutenant O'Rourke, Front and Center". Larry Storch was nominated for an Emmy Award for [...] "Outstanding performance by an actor in a leading role in a comedy series" [...] in 1967.|$|R
