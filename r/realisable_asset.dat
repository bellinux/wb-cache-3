Its portfolio decreased 3.4% to RM145.1 billion {{in terms of its}} <b>realisable</b> <b>asset</b> value (RAV), and declined 6.4% to RM101.9 billion in terms of net worth adjusted (NWA). Khazanah also made investments totalling RM8.7 billion and 13 divestments with proceeds amounting to RM4.7 billion, with a gain on divestments of RM2.9 billion for the year.|$|E

5000|$|In July 2011, it was {{reported}} that the Inland Revenue Department ("IRD") was chasing Unite Support Services Limited for $150,175 in unpaid taxes.

Based on a report filed by the Official Assignee, there appear to be no <b>realisable</b> <b>assets</b> and creditor claims totalling around $153,000, including around $97,000 owing to IRD.|$|R
5000|$|The United Kingdom {{was one of}} {{the victors}} of the Second World War, but the cost of the war was massive, and the nation's <b>realisable</b> <b>assets</b> were exhausted. Thus, the late 1940s was a time of {{austerity}} and economic restraint, which gave way to prosperity in the 1950s. The Labour Party held control from 1945-51, and granted independence to India in 1947. Most of the other major colonies became independent in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Britain collaborated closely with the United States during the Cold War after 1947, and in 1949 helped form NATO as a military alliance against Soviet Communism. After a long debate and initial scepticism, the UK joined the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973, but voted to leave the European Union (EU) in 2016. Immigration from South Asia, the West Indies, and Eastern Europe produced a multicultural society, while traditional Anglican and other denominations of Christianity declined sharply.|$|R
50|$|By early 1538, {{suppression}} of the friaries was widely being anticipated, in some houses all friars save the prior had already left; and <b>realisable</b> <b>assets</b> (standing timber, chalices, vestments) were being sold off. Cromwell deputed Richard Yngworth, suffragan Bishop of Dover and former Provincial of the Dominicans, to obtain the friars' surrender; which he achieved rapidly by drafting new injunctions that enforced each order's rules and required friars to resume a strict conventual life within their walls. In effect, failure to accede to the king's wish for voluntary surrender would result, for most, in enforced homelessness and starvation. Once surrender had been accepted, and formally witnessed, Yngworth reported briefly to Cromwell on his actions; noting for each friary, who was the current tenant of the gardens, what was the general state of the friary buildings, and whether the friary church had valuable lead on roofs and gutters. Mostly he had found poverty, derelict buildings and leased-out gardens as the only income-bearing asset. Yngworth had no authority to dispose of lands and property and could not negotiate pensions; so the friars appear simply to have been released from their vows and dismissed with a gratuity of around 40 shillings each, which Yngworth took from whatever cash resources were in hand. He listed by name the friars remaining in each house at surrender so that Cromwell could provide them with capacities, legal permission {{to pursue a career}} as a secular priest. Furthermore, Yngworth had no discretion to maintain use of the friary churches, even though many had continued to attract congregations for preaching and worship; and these were rapidly disposed of by the Court of Augmentations. Of all the friary churches in England and Wales, only St. Andrew's Hall, Norwich and Greyfriars Church in Reading remain standing; almost all other friaries have disappeared with few visible traces.|$|R
