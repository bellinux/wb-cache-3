50|$|Wholesalers, like Costco, buy the {{products}} from the manufacturer and sell them to the consumer. In this channel, consumers can buy products directly from the wholesaler in bulk. By buying the items in bulk from the wholesaler the prices of the product are reduced. This is because the wholesaler takes away extra costs, such as service costs or sales force costs, that customers usually pay when buying from retail; making the price much cheaper for the consumer. However, the wholesaler does not always sell directly to the consumer. Sometimes the wholesaler will go through a retailer before the product gets {{into the hands of}} the consumer. Each dealer (the manufacturer, the wholesaler, and the retailer) will be looking to make a decent profit margin from the product. So each time the buyer purchases the merchandise from another source, the price of the product has to increase, in order to maximize the profit each person will receive. This raises the price of the product for the end-user. Due to the simultaneous and joint work of wholesaler and retailer, a trade can only be beneficial if; a market is situated on a larger area, the supply of goods and products is carried out small but urgent consignments (products), it can be cost-effective and profitable by supplying bigger consignments (products) to fewer customers. Industrial factories are in the seek of using advantages of mass production in order to produce and sell big lots (batches) while retailers look and prefer purchasing smaller consignments. This method for factories could lead to instant sales, high efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Therefore, particularly in these situations wholesaler now plays a role where it reconciles these contradictory aspirations. The wholesaler purchases big lots then divides minimizes after resells them to further retailers. The work of wholesaler facilitates and makes it less burdensome for the transportation of production. Hence, an amount of delivered goods diminishes through the use of this channel (the wholesale). For example, if five manufactories supply goods directly to hundred different retail stores, then they will have to have 500 of deliveries (5 times 100). However, if those five manufactories supply the same wholesaler, and the wholesaler at this stage supplies 100 different retailers, then the total number of deliveries will decrease to 105 (5 plus 100). Another important component to consider in the practice of wholesaling is storage. Storage of goods is one of the characterized aspects of the work of a wholesaler. Wholesaler regulates the deliveries of goods, having synchronized the production and consumption of material goods. Moreover, he as the wholesaler further assumes the financial obligations related to the immobilization of funds invested in the creation of commodity stocks. Although, the chain of transition suggests that the wholesaler directly communicates and deals with a manufacturer may not be unambiguous. The contribution of a distributor is highly acknowledged and plays a crucial role in distributing flows of goods before it gets in the hands of wholesalers, retailers and so on. A distributor is the <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> and performs functions on behalf of the manufacturer for the distribution of goods from producer to wholesaler or retailer. A distributor is always in the seek out for orders from different clients and possesses activeness in promoting producer's products and services. The main tasks of a distributor are; study the market and the creation of databases of consumers, advertising of goods, an organization of a service for the delivery of goods, stocking up the inventory levels, the creation of a stable sales network, which includes dealers and other intermediaries, depending on the market situation. Distributors scarcely sell a manufactories' goods directly to customers.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To measure <b>the</b> various diameters <b>of</b> laser fibers {{from various}} {{manufacturers}} and {{compare them with}} the advertised diameter. METHODS: Fourteen different unused laser fibers from 6 leading manufacturers with advertised diameters of 200, 270, 272, 273, 365, and 400 μm were measured by light microscopy. The outer diameter (including the fiber coating, cladding, and core), cladding diameter (including the cladding and the fiber core), and core diameter were measured. Industry <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturers</b> were interviewed about <b>the</b> diameter <b>of</b> their fibers. RESULTS: For all fibers, the outer and cladding diameters differed significantly from the advertised diameter (P <. 00001). The outer diameter, which is of most practical relevance for urologists, exhibited a median increase of 87. 3 % (range, 50. 7 %- 116. 7 %). The outer, cladding, and core diameters of fibers with equivalent advertised diameters differed by up to 180, 100, and 78 μm, respectively. Some 200 -μm fibers had larger outer diameters than the 270 - to 273 -μm fibers. All packaging material and all laser fibers lacked clear and precise fiber diameter information labels. <b>Of</b> 12 <b>representatives</b> interviewed, 8, 3, and 1 considered the advertised diameter to be the outer, the cladding, and the core diameter, respectively. Representatives within the same company frequently gave different answers. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that, at present, {{there is a lack}} of uniformity between laser fiber <b>manufacturers,</b> and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> information conveyed to urologists regarding laser fiber diameter may be incorrect. Because fibers larger than the advertised laser fibers are known to influence key interventional parameters, this misinformation can have surgical repercussions...|$|R

40|$|When {{using the}} {{functional}} build approach to manufacturing validation during new product development, manufacturers use pre-production assemblies {{to evaluate whether}} components within an assembly may build dimensionally correct products.

In the 1980 s, {{economic}} reforms created a job market for poor, uneducated rural women in the ready-made garment industry, mostly located in urban areas.

This study explores <b>the</b> lived experience <b>of</b> women in Bangladesh working in the ready-made garment industry as they strive to be mothers and family providers, often in high-stress conditions. Methods: The study was conducted in two industrial areas of Dhaka over 8 months. Data collection included a literature review, 20 in-depth interviews with married female garment workers, and 14 key-informant interviews with officials from <b>the</b> Ministry <b>of</b> Labour and Employment, health-service providers within the garment factories, factory managers, and <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bangladesh Garment <b>Manufacturers</b> and Exporters Association. The data collected were analyzed thematically. Results: Poverty was a key motivating factor for female migrant workers to move from rural areas. Their children stay in their village with their grandparents, because of their mothers’ work conditions and <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> childcare. <b>The</b> women reported stress, anxiety, restlessness, and thoughts of suicide, due to <b>the</b> double burden <b>of</b> work and separation from their children and family support. Further, they cannot easily access government hospital services due to their long work hours, and the limited medical services provided in the workplace do not meet their needs.
