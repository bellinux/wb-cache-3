5|$|This star lies at a vertex of {{a widely}} spaced {{asterism}} called the Summer Triangle, {{which consists of}} Vega plus the two first-magnitude stars Altair, in Aquila, and Deneb in Cygnus. This formation is the approximate shape of a <b>right</b> <b>triangle,</b> with Vega located at its right angle. The Summer Triangle is recognizable in the northern skies for there are few other bright stars in its vicinity.|$|E
5|$|This tiling {{is called}} the Pythagorean tiling {{because it has been}} used as the basis of proofs of the Pythagorean theorem by the ninth-century Arabic {{mathematician}}s Al-Nayrizi and Thābit ibn Qurra, and by the 19th-century British amateur mathematician Henry Perigal. If the sides of the two squares forming the tiling are the numbers a and b, then the closest distance between corresponding points on congruent squares is c, where c is the length of the hypotenuse of a <b>right</b> <b>triangle</b> having sides a and b. For instance, in the illustration to the left, the two squares in the Pythagorean tiling have side lengths 5 and 12 units long, and the side length of the tiles in the overlaying square tiling is 13, based on the Pythagorean triple (5,12,13).|$|E
25|$|Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) Theorem: The {{hypotenuse}} {{and a leg}} in a <b>right</b> <b>triangle</b> {{have the}} same length as those in another <b>right</b> <b>triangle.</b> This is also called RHS (right-angle, hypotenuse, side).|$|E
50|$|Combining {{restrictions}} that a shape be equable {{and that its}} dimensions be integers is significantly more restrictive than either restriction on its own. For instance, there are infinitely many Pythagorean triples describing integer-sided <b>right</b> <b>triangles,</b> and there are infinitely many equable <b>right</b> <b>triangles</b> with non-integer sides; however, {{there are only two}} equable integer <b>right</b> <b>triangles,</b> with side lengths (5,12,13) and (6,8,10).|$|R

As a corollary we show that the number of primitive <b>right</b> <b>triangles</b> whose area is n times the perimeter is 2 k.
