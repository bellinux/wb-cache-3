40|$|By gamma spectroscopic {{measurement}} {{a content}} of natural radio-nuclides (40 K, 238 U, 226 Ra, 232 Th) and 137 Cs was determined in samples of soil, alfalfa, maize and moss on six {{sites in the}} surroundings of Belgrade. Natural radionuclides in the soil were at the level characteristic for Serbia, whereas a relatively high level of activity of 137 Cs (around 30 Bq kg- 1) was determined. On the other hand, in plant samples mostly used as feed (such as alfalfa and maize) the concentration of natural <b>radio-nuclide</b> activity and 137 Cs was relatively low, i. e. below the range of detection. The content of natural radio-nuclides in moss was within the standard range of values specific for Serbia. However, the activity level of 137 Cs in moss gathered from the wider area around Belgrade, was high, the highest measured level being in the Avala-Zuce area (158 - 221 Bq kg- 1).

40|$|The Dutch {{national}} research programme into {{the feasibility of}} retrievable storage of radioactive waste (CORA Programme Phase I; CORA: Comité Opslag Radioactief Afval = Committee on Radioactive Waste Disposal) examined the suitability of Tertiary clay deposits for such storage. Long-term isolation – up to 1 million years – of high-level radioactive waste under varying conditions is essential. A key concern is the hydro-mechanical response of the clay deposits in which radioactive waste might possibly be stored, in particular during glacial climate conditions as has happened repeatedly in the Netherlands during the Pleistocene. To evaluate this possibility hydro-mechanical computer simulations and mechanical laboratory experiments have been performed to analyse the effects of glacial loading by a thousand-metre-thick ice sheet on the permeability characteristics, fluid flow rates and the associated migration of <b>radio-nuclides</b> both within and out of Tertiary clays. Glacial loading causes the expulsion of pore water from deeply buried clay deposits into adjoining aquifers. The rates and duration of the consolidation-driven outflow {{of water from the}} clay deposit, are very sensitive to the permeability of the clay and the dynamics of the advancing ice sheet. The maximum outflow rate of pore water is 1 mm per year. This rate is approximately three times faster than the flow rate of water in clay prior to ice loading. These preliminary simulation studies also indicate that cyclic loading can result in more rapid migration of <b>radio-nuclides</b> in clays. In clay deposits that are covered by a thick ice sheet, the contribution of dispersed transport relative to the total transport by diffusion amounts to 14 %, assuming that there is no absorption of <b>radio-nuclides</b> by the clays and a longitudinal dispersivity of 50 m.

40|$|Targeting tumors with antibody-based {{therapeutics}} is {{a complex}} task presenting multiple kinetic barriers. Antibody internalization and clearance inhibit uptake both in solid tumors, limited by tu-mor vascular permeability, and in micrometastases, limited by diffusion. Methods: A modeling exercise is used to introduce 2 simple criteria that must be less than unity for saturation of both tumors and micrometastases. The clearance modulus and the Thiele modulus are ratios of the plasma clearance rate and antibody catabolism, respectively, to the tumor tissue pene-tration rate. Results: Even low rates of antigen internalization from constitutive membrane turnover can significantly retard an-tibody penetration. Rapid clearance of single-chain variable frag-ments also hinders uptake, often more than counterbalancing their more rapid extravasation and diffusion.
