However, Johnson did not publicly push for the legislation at the time; his advisers warned him of political costs for vigorously pursuing a voting rights bill so soon after Congress had passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Johnson was concerned that championing voting rights would endanger his Great Society reforms by angering Southern Democrats in Congress.|$|E

40|$|It is {{undoubtedly}} true {{that the law}} of torts does not generally hold children to the exercise of {{the same degree of}} care and intelligence that it requires of adults. To do otherwise, would be to shut its eyes, ostrich-like, to the facts of life and to burden unduly the child 2 ̆ 7 s growth to majority. Similar concessions to immaturity are made in other branches of the law.

It is not {{the purpose of this paper}} to discover that age and those situations. Assuming that the adult standard is not to be applied, the problem is what standard, if any, is to be used.

40|$|The {{literature}} identifies {{a significant}} drop in merger control enforcement activity {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic during the last decade. Furthermore, this drop in enforcement activity is convincingly connected to enforcement problems on the sides of the competition agencies. This paper goes beyond the identification of under-enforcement and proceeds to the analysis of causes for the enforcement problems and the discussion of possible solutions. It argues that modern institutional economics suggest that a lack of ‘fit’ between the ‘new’ economic approach to merger control and the ‘old’ institutional environment of the legal enforcement procedures explains the drop of enforcement effectiveness {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic by implicitly raising the standard of proof, leading to unattainable standards, virtually eroding merger control enforcement power. As a consequence, the effects-based approach to merger control fails due to its failure to acknowledge its institutional implications. Reconciling industrial and institutional economics – promoting a comprehensive competition economics approach – however offers avenues towards an effective use of sophisticated industrial economic theories and methods. Firstly, incorporating economics into enforceable rules like strong <b>rebuttable</b> <b>presumptions</b> would adjust substantive merger control policy to the procedural institutional environment. Secondly, a reform of the standards of proof provisions would adjust the procedural framework to the characteristics of modern economic evidence and concepts. In summary, the enforcement problems in merger control require even more economic thinking, complementing industrial economic thought with institutional economic thought. I like to thank Arndt Christiansen and Eva Roth as well as the participants of research seminars at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and at the Düsseldorf Institute for Competition Economics (DICE) for valuable comments on earlier versions of this paper.

After having identified the legal issues requiring attention in the introductory chapter, and after a short historical review of the development of institutional pawnshops and the nature of usury law, the thesis takes a comparative approach to the question, examining the legal protection available to consumer users of pawnshops in France, the Netherlands, Germany, England, USA, Australia, Norway, Denmark and Finland, in order to cast the divergent interests into bold relief and suggest how those interests can be reconciled. The thesis will then concentrate on the competing policy arguments for and against usury control. The parties’ needs addressed and the methods utilized by legislation to meet such needs are identified and evaluated. The material differences distinguishing pawn tickets from other documents and instruments relating to personal property are next highlighted, and legislation with possible application to pawn tickets canvassed.

40|$|This paper explores Congress’ {{power to}} limit {{state and local}} authorities’ use of eminent domain to further {{economic}} revitalization. More particularly, it examines whether Congress can constrain the discretion to invoke eminent domain which {{state and local officials}} appear entitled to under the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Kelo v. City of New London, — U. S. —, 125 S. Ct. 2655 (2005). The question involves and exploration and assessment of the Supreme Court’s recent jurisprudence regarding federalism and judicial supremacy. In providing that private property may not be taken for “public use” without just compensation, the Fifth Amendment implicitly precludes government officials from compelling citizens to relinquish their property for something other than a “public use. ” However, the United States Supreme Court has long defined “public use” expansively, so expansively that the federal courts do not meaningfully review government officials’ justifications for invoking eminent domain. In Kelo, the Court revisited its deferential approach. Kelo involved a claim that a municipality’s attempt to take land by eminent domain and transfer it to a private entity, as a part of an economic revitalization plan, did not qualify as a taking for a “public use,” and thus was constitutionally prohibited. The Court ultimately reaffirmed its expansive definition of “public use. ” The decision not only sparked public outrage and state legislative initiatives to restrict the use of eminent domain for economic redevelopment, but attracted congressional attention. The House enacted a resolution disapproving the decision and an appropriations rider barring funding to enforce the ruling. At least three bills have been introduced in the House and Senate to withhold federal funds to economic revitalization projects sited {{in whole or in part}} of land acquired by local authorities using eminent domain. This paper concludes that Congress has power to constrain state and local use of eminent domain under the Enforcement Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause, and that Congress’ power to proceed under the Spending Clause may not be as expansive as it appears. The Enforcement Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment allows Congress to limit state and local authorities use of eminent domain to protect property owner’s Fifth Amendment rights. Because the Court recognizes citizen’s rights to prevent the taking of their property for “private use” by another, but faces problems in enforcing that right, Congress may take some precisely-tailored actions that will give the right practical protection. Such measures might include: 1) altering the measure of “just compensation” due when property is taken for economic development, 2) specifying minimal procedures to assure that state and local officials make eminent domain decisions in a transparent and politically-accountable manner, 3) establishing <b>rebuttable</b> <b>presumptions</b> that in certain circumstances a taking is for a “private,” not a “public,” use, or 4) prohibiting the use of eminent domain altogether in certain situations. The Commerce Clause also gives Congress some leeway to legislate with regard to state and local reliance upon eminent domain. Congress may take steps to ensure that eminent domain, which serves as an alternative to the market for real estate, does not operate in an economically wasteful manner or harm involuntary participants in the process. Congress may also take steps to address the consequences of any undue influence interstate commercial enterprises gain over local governments by their ability to play one tax-strapped locality off against another, and one of those consequences may be the excessive or oppressive use of eminent domain. However, the Court may more vigorously police congressional limitations on state use of eminent domain than congressional legislation conflicting with states’ assertions of their regulatory powers. The Court may conclude that the power of eminent domain, like the privilege of sovereign immunity, is such an inherent and essential aspect of sovereignty that the constitutionally-mandated respect for the states as independent sovereigns imposes special constraints on congressional authority. See, e. g., Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 715, 748 - 49 (1999) (discussing sovereign immunity). Congress’ spending clause powers appear virtually unlimited — the Court has not found Congress to have exceeded its Spending Clause authority since the Lochner Era. Not surprisingly, then, Congress’ initial response to Kelo focuses on denying federal funding to states and localities that exercise the eminent domain powers recognized in Kelo. The limits on Congress’ power to condition federal funding on waiver of certain individual rights and sovereign prerogatives has bedeviled courts and commentators in a variety of contexts. The issue is most often discussed in terms of “unconstitutional conditions. ” The paper categorizes the federal government’s interest in imposing grant limitations as: 1) “program defining,” 2) “symbolic” or “dissociative,” 3) “functional,” or 4) “protective. ” Congress should have more leeway in imposing grant conditions that serve functional purposes as opposed to symbolic of dissociative purposes. Ultimately, Congress’ interest in limiting support for state and local projects sited in whole or in part on land acquired by eminent domain, is really a symbolic or dissociative one, which merely permits Congress to ensure state and local authorities do not use federal funds to acquire property taken by eminent domain. The symbolic interest does not support the scope of the grant conditions currently contemplated by Congress, prohibiting all funding in connection with a redevelopment project sited in whole or in part on land acquired by eminent domain. While the paper’s analysis focuses on grant conditions regarding eminent domain, the general analysis of government grant conditions has a much wider application...|$|R
