5|$|Economists have {{referred}} to the onset of World War I {{as the end of}} an age of innocence for foreign exchange markets, as it was the first geopolitical conflict to have a destabilizing and paralyzing impact. The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914 following Germany's invasion of France and Belgium. In the weeks prior, the foreign exchange market in London was the first to exhibit distress. European tensions and increasing political uncertainty motivated investors to chase liquidity, prompting commercial banks to borrow heavily from London's discount market. As the money market tightened, discount lenders began rediscounting their reserves at the Bank of England rather than discounting new pounds sterling. The Bank of England was forced to raise discount rates daily for three days from 3% on July 30 to 10% by August 1. As foreign investors resorted to buying pounds for <b>remittance</b> to London just to pay off their newly maturing securities, the sudden demand for pounds led the pound to appreciate beyond its gold value against most major currencies, yet sharply depreciate against the French franc after French banks began liquidating their London accounts. <b>Remittance</b> to London became increasingly difficult and culminated in a record exchange rate of $6.50 USD/GBP. Emergency measures were introduced in the form of moratoria and extended bank holidays, but to no effect as financial contracts became informally unable to be negotiated and export embargoes thwarted gold shipments. A week later, the Bank of England began to address the deadlock in the foreign exchange markets by establishing a new channel for transatlantic payments whereby participants could make <b>remittance</b> payments to the U.K. by depositing gold designated for a Bank of England account with Canada's Minister of Finance, and in exchange receive pounds sterling at an exchange rate of $4.90. Approximately $104 million USD in remittances flowed through this channel in the next two months. However, pound sterling liquidity ultimately did not improve due to inadequate relief for merchant banks receiving sterling bills. As the pound sterling was the world's reserve currency and leading vehicle currency, market illiquidity and merchant banks' hesitance to accept sterling bills left currency markets paralyzed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Remittances</b> are {{increasingly}} becoming {{an important source}} of external financing for the developing countries. For some of the developing countries, it forms almost 40 - 50 % of their GDP.

This study undertakes impact analysis of <b>remittances</b> on poverty in developing countries at two levels.

5|$|The {{relatively}} stable {{value of the}} currency in the 1990s compared to the 1980s is explained by Peter D.

Private <b>remittance</b> companies known as hawala assist in the transfer of money.

40|$|Inequality {{decomposition}} {{techniques are}} {{used to analyze the}} different impacts of domestic and international <b>remittances</b> on household income inequality in the Dominican Republic. Domestic <b>remittances</b> seem more likely to be equalizing than international <b>remittances.</b> The negative marginal effect on inequality of domestic <b>remittances</b> is more prominent among rural households, and in particular among landless rural households, while the negative marginal effect on inequality of international <b>remittances</b> is more prominent among urban households, and in particular outside of the Santo Domingo area. Stronger marginal effects of <b>remittances</b> were found among female-headed households, the elderly and the less educated. Both domestic and international <b>remittances</b> are higher among female-headed households and the elderly. Education is associated with lower domestic <b>remittances</b> and higher international <b>remittances,</b> probably reflecting the role of education in promoting international versus domestic migration. An increase in schooling increases inequality through domestic <b>remittances</b> and decreases inequality through international <b>remittances,</b> while a reduction in household size reduces inequality through both domestic and international <b>remittances.</b> This analysis highlights the importance of the distinction between domestic and international <b>remittances</b> as drivers of inequality as well as the importance of identifying and quantifying the determinants of <b>remittances</b> and their subsequent impact on inequality.

40|$|This paper uses a new, 2005 / 06 nationally-representative {{household}} {{survey to}} analyze the impact of internal <b>remittances</b> (from Ghana) and international <b>remittances</b> (from African and other countries) on poverty and inequality in Ghana.

The paper finds that both internal and international <b>remittances</b> reduce the level, depth, and severity of poverty in Ghana. However, {{the size of the}} poverty reduction depends on the type of <b>remittances</b> received. In general, poverty in Ghana is reduced more by international than internal <b>remittances.</b> For households receiving international <b>remittances,</b> the level of poverty falls by 88. 1 percent with the inclusion of remittances; for households receiving internal <b>remittances,</b> poverty falls by 69. 4 percent with the inclusion of <b>remittances.</b> The paper also finds that both types of <b>remittances</b> increase income inequality in Ghana.
