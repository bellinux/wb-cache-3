5000|$|The {{ambiguity}} was {{the result}} of a NASA decision to change designation of missions starting in Fiscal Year 1984.

30|$|Lastly, {{previous}} {{studies have shown that}} negative achievement emotions like confusion may sometimes promote deep inquiry and effortful thinking, which lead to increased learning (D’Mello et al. 2012; D’Mello et al. 2014). The positive benefits of confusion only occurred when learners had sufficient ability to regulate this negative emotion and were provided with scaffolds to help resolve the confusion. In these past studies by D’Mello et al. (2012, 2014), confusion was experimentally induced, specific scaffolds were given to help <b>resolve</b> <b>confusion,</b> and the samples were undergraduate students. However, in our setting, elementary school students may lack the necessary emotional regulation skills to turn experiences of confusion into learning gains. Further, confusion and frustration were to a certain extent part of the design process, and specific scaffolds were not always given to help students overcome their negative emotions. Also, unlike in experimental contexts, design-based courses are designed to be student-led. Students are asked to lead the learning process, independently seek information needed for design, {{and figure out how to}} resolve conflicting information when they experience confusion. In this naturalistic setting, the benefits wrought by negative emotions like confusion need to be carefully balanced with other negative implications such as decreased self-efficacy and interest.|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} dynamic range of OCT/OCM {{instruments}} configured with unbalanced interferometers, e. g., Michelson interferometers, {{with that of}} instruments utilizing balanced interferometers and balanced photodetection. We define the dynamic range (DR) as {{the ratio of the}} maximum fringe amplitude achieved with a highly reflecting surface to the root-mean-square (rms) noise. Balanced systems achieve a dynamic range 2. 5 times higher than that of a Michelson interferometer, enabling an image acquisition speed roughly 6 times faster. This maximum improvement occurs at light source powers of a few milliwatts. At light source powers higher than 30 mW, the advantage in acquisition speed of balanced systems is reduced to a factor of 4. For video-rate imaging, the increased cost and complexity of a balanced system may be outweighed by the factor of 4 to 6 enhancement in image acquisition speed. We include in our analysis the 2 ̆ 2 beat-noise 2 ̆ 2 resulting from incoherent fight backscattered from the sample, which reduces the advantage of balanced systems. We attempt to <b>resolve</b> <b>confusion</b> surrounding the origin and magnitude of 2 ̆ 2 beat-noise 2 ̆ 2, first described by L. Mandel in 1962.

40|$|Photoinduced {{biological}} processes occur via one photon absorption in natural light, which is weak, CW and incoherent, but are often {{studied in the}} laboratory using pulsed coherent light.

40|$|Abstract. New {{high-resolution}} {{adaptive optics}} systems provide an unprecedentedly detailed view of nearby star forming regions. In particular, young nearby T Tauri stars can be probed at much smaller physical scales (a few AU) than possible just {{a decade ago}} (several tens of AU). Of major importance is closing the sensitivity gap between imaging and spectral surveys for stellar companions. This allows for 1) calibration of pre-main-sequence evolutionary tracks by obtaining accurate dynamical masses, 2) <b>resolving</b> <b>confusion</b> problems arising by placing unresolved systems in colour-magnitude diagrams, and 3) well defined and determined multiplicity fractions of young stellar systems, important for discriminating star formation scenarios.

30|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{process has}} often been a significant challenge. Recently, an international and multidisciplinary consensus document was published (Baguley et al. 2014), aiming to i) to develop a conceptual definition; ii) to <b>resolve</b> <b>confusion</b> regarding the nomenclature, iii) to produce a consensus set of diagnostic criteria and iv) to develop a diagnostic tool for evaluating the presence and severity of the crisis. In this document the name of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) was proposed and was defined as “A recognized syndrome, in a subgroup of survivors of severe acquired brain injury, which involves simultaneous, paroxysmal transient increases in sympathetic (elevated heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, sweating) and motor (posturing) activity’. This process also developed a diagnostic tool consisting of two components: the probability of diagnosis (the Diagnosis Likelihood Tool [DLT]) and {{the severity of the}} clinical features (the Clinical Feature Scale [CFS]). The numerical output of these two components is added together to estimate the diagnostic likelihood of PSH. These components form the PSH Assessment Measure (PSH-AM) (Baguley et al. 2014). To date, this is the first scale that standardizes published diagnostic criteria and assesses the severity of the crisis. It is easy to apply in clinical practice and very useful to improve the efficiency of diagnosis. While we wait for preliminary results and validation studies, this consensus document solves what until now was a real diagnostic challenge.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The manual {{muscle test}} (MMT) {{has been offered}} as a {{chiropractic}} assessment tool that may help diagnose neuromusculoskeletal dysfunction. We contend that due {{to the number of}} manipulative practitioners using this test as part of the assessment of patients, clinical guidelines for the MMT are required to heighten the accuracy in the use of this tool. Objective To present essential operational definitions of the MMT for chiropractors and other clinicians that should improve the reliability of the MMT as a diagnostic test. Controversy about the usefulness and reliability of the MMT for chiropractic diagnosis is ongoing, and clinical guidelines about the MMT are needed to <b>resolve</b> <b>confusion</b> regarding the MMT as used in clinical practice as well as the evaluation of experimental evidence concerning its use. Discussion We expect that the resistance to accept the MMT as a reliable and valid diagnostic tool will continue within some portions of the manipulative professions if clinical guidelines for the use of MMT methods are not established and accepted. Unreliable assessments of this method of diagnosis will continue when non-standard MMT research papers are considered representative of the methods used by properly trained clinicians. Conclusion Practitioners who employ the MMT should use these clinical guidelines for improving their use of the MMT in their assessments of muscle dysfunction in patients with musculoskeletal pain. </p...|$|E
40|$|The green alga Oophila ambystomatus (Chlamydomonadales, Chlorophyceae) is {{well known}} as the {{symbiotic}} partner of Ambystoma maculatum, the yellow-spotted salamander. Recent molecular work has revealed phylogenetic diversity within isolates of Oophila from New England. Here I investigate physiological properties and genetic diversity of the algal symbionts representing different evolutionary lineages. In other well-studied symbiotic systems involving algae, e. g., Chlorella and Hydra, algae and lichen, or Symbiodinium and Scleractinian corals, the algal symbiont is capable of multiple trophic modes, thus influencing its capacity as a partner. In this study I investigated whether genetically differentiated strains of Oophila are capable of absorbing organic carbon compounds (heterotrophic growth) and hypothesize how this might play into its symbiotic relationship. A growth study examined each strain’s ability to grow in light (16 : 8 L:D; 41 μmol/m 2) and in dark (0 : 24 L:D; 0 μmol/m 2) in three different media types (BBM, BBM+glu, BBM+gal). I determined there is metabolic variability among the strains that indicates each may provide differential benefits to their partner. I also reviewed the taxonomic history of Oophila to <b>resolve</b> <b>confusion</b> over its validity. After a brief recount of its history, I determined that the name is valid, and suggest a recent collection from the type locality of Middlesex Fells Reservation be designated as an epitype given that the aged type material lacks diagnostic features and its DNA is degraded.
