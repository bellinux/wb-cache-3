40|$|A dynamic {{simulation}} {{and test}} of frame with thin walled closed section beams considering warping conditions have been performed. When a beam is subjected under torsional moment, the cross section will deform an warping {{as well as}} twist. For some thin-walled sections warping will be large, and accompanying warping restraint will induce axial and shear stresses and reduce the twist of beam which stiffens the beam in torsion. This paper presents that an warping <b>restraint</b> <b>factor</b> in finite element model effects the behavior of beam deformation and dynamic mode shape.

40|$|The growing {{popularity}} {{of the use of}} cellular steel beams in composite floors comes {{at the same time as}} an increasing attention to fire safety engineering design. The recommendation for their design in fire limit states remains very primitive and this is due to the lack of general research in this area. A total of six simply-supported and restrained composite cellular floor beams subjected to elevated temperatures, were tested at The University of Ulster. The first three beams conducted were simply-supported of 4. 5 m span lengths, with main variables, different steel geometries and opening shapes. The beams were subjected to single and two point loadings represented by load ratio of 0. 3 determined from the pre-design and finite element modelling of the sections at ambient temperature for the evaluation of the failure loads. Deflections were recorded using linear variable differential transducers (L VDT) during the fire tests, and temperatures were measured using thermocouples located along the length of the steel beams and the composite slabs. The main failure modes in two tests were the web post buckling associated with Vierendeel bending; whereas the latter was the main failure mode in the symmetric composite cellular beam with two elongated web openings. Similar failure modes were observed in the finite element modelling at ambient temperature. The experimental results have been compared against the results obtained by DIANA software for finite element modelling and were in good agreement. The capability of the model demonstrated excellent prediction for the three tests in terms of temperature distribution, deflection behaviour and failure mode after improvements were made to the models. A parametric study has been conducted using the analytical based web-post failure characterized by the failure of the critical section for the evaluation of temperature and time of failure. The results were also compared with the experimental data and were found in good correlation when using the appropriate effective length subjected to buckling, which is different from one beam to another beam. However, it was found that the formula of shear buckling capacity of the web post at elevated temperatures provided in the SCI [22] documentation, which is expressed in terms of longitudinal shear needs to be adjusted in order to predict accurate effective length of post web buckling for cellular beams, with different geometries and cross sectional dimensions. The second phase of fire tests was restrained cellular beams with longer span lengths of 7. 5 m. Different parameters were investigated by varying the depths of composite slabs and shape of steel decking compared to the tests of simply-supported beams. The beams were also pre-designed first at ambient temperature in order to evaluate the failure loading and 0. 3 of this load was considered in the three tests. The finite element modelling at cold temperature showed that the beams considered as simply-supported failed due to flexural bending accompanied with Vierendeel mechanism at different load levels. Similar instruments and equipment have been used as in the tests of simply-supported beams, and the difference is represented by the restraint frame that was positioned around the furnace where the specimens were axially restrained and subjected to heating. In addition, strain gauges were used at different locations in the cold-ends of the cellular beams, top of the slabs and the frame for the measurement of strains. The failure modes in the tests were flexural bending associated with initial stage of Vierendeel bending and the buckling of the web posts. There was no occurrence of lateral buckling as expected due to the low degree of restraint and type of end-condition used. The web post buckling was the main failure mode in composite beam with the smallest depth of composite slab, a sudden change occurred at the last stage when compressive forces changed into tensile force that can lead to the development of catenary action and the occurrence of lateral buckling of the bottom flange. The effect of restraint on cellular beams has been carried out first using finite element mode ling before the fire tests where asymmetric and symmetric composite cellular beams with circular web-openings have been studied under high and low restraint factors at ambient and elevated temperatures. At ambient temperature, the main failure modes were web-posts buckling for both sections in case of low <b>restraint</b> <b>factor</b> as in the case of simply-supported beams; whereas web-posts buckling occurred and followed by lateral torsional buckling in case of high <b>restraint</b> <b>factor.</b> In both sections, compressive forces increase with the increase in loading, and the load-carrying capacity is significant in case of high <b>restraint</b> <b>factor</b> compared to low <b>restraint</b> <b>factor</b> due to high compressive force developed from composite slab and the catenary action allowing the section to experience maximum deflection before failure. At elevated temperature, the web-posts buckling was the main failure mode for a low degree of restraint; whereas, a severe web-posts buckling followed by lateral torsional buckling were the main failure modes for a high <b>restraint</b> <b>factor.</b> The restrained beams tested have been modelled using the model developed and all the data gathered during the tests in terms of temperatures recordings and axial stiffness. The model showed a good correlation with the tests results and was next extended beyond the limit of the experimental fire tests by considering the full fire exposed lengths of the cellular beams; by investigating the influence of different degrees of restraint conditions and depths of composite slabs having different shapes of steel decking.

40|$|ABSTRACT RELIABILITY AND EFFECT OF PARTIALLY RESTRAINED WOOD SHEAR WALLS by JOHN J. GRUBER MARCH 2012 Advisor:	Dr. Gongkang Fu Major:		Civil Engineering Degree:	Doctor or Philosophy The {{prescriptive}} {{design of}} the most widely used residential building code in the United States, the IRC, allows the use of partially restrained wood shear walls to resist wind and seismic loads. Wind load is the most common controlling lateral design load for these structures. In contrast, the complimenting building code, the IBC, requires either a restraining dead load or a mechanical hold down device to resist overturning. To prescribe a safe structure, {{it is important to know}} the effect of partial restraint on the overturning resistance of wood shear walls constructed in accordance with the IRC and equally important whether the partially restrained wood shear walls provide the same level of reliability as fully restrained wood shear walls for wind load. This is the focus of this research. Twenty five Monotonic tests were conducted of 42 ̆ 7 x 82 ̆ 7 wood shear walls with five varying restraining methods (wall types). There were five sets of five wall types. One of the sets had only an anchor bolt, three sets had different dead loads with one anchor bolt, and one set had a mechanical hold down. The results of the test program were used to determine the partial restraint effect, create a nonlinear finite element model, and to determine the statistical data required to perform a Monte Carlo simulation of the wall behavior. The Monte Carlo simulation result was used to calibrate a nonlinear partial <b>restraint</b> <b>factor</b> to a target reliability index of 3. 25. The calibration was performed for both ASD and LRFD load combinations as required by the IBC. The research concludes with a closed-form solution, including the calibrated nonlinear partial <b>restraint</b> <b>factor</b> developed, to determine the unit shear capacity of a partially restrained or fully restrained (with dead load or mechanical hold down) wood shear wall constructed in accordance with the IRC by utilizing the fully restrained nominal unit shear values of AF 2 ̆ 6 PA 2 ̆ 7 s Special Design Provisions for Wind and Seismic...|$|E

40|$|The {{problems}} of transport energy use and emissions {{have been examined}} using an overview approach involving basic and multi-disciplinary research, consistent with the emerging discipline of environmental science. Facets of both problems and the inextricable link between them have been explained. An extensive literature review of the technological and land use options available for making contributions to the solution of both problems is presented. A wide range of criteria {{have been used in}} assessing the technological possibilities which reveal the complexity of planning for technological change. The potential for easy technological solutions when viewed in this total perspective is not apparent. The easy solutions tend to have the least potential for providing energy and emissions benefits; for example electronic ignitions were tested and the results were consistent with this hypothesis. The harder solutions tend to have other more fundamental implications which tend to mitigate against their use. Land use options were reviewed and they suggested considerable potential for improving energy and emissions through density, centrality and traffic restraint. To test this potential and to provide an overview of the their transport energy use, motor vehicle emissions and land use. The study showed that: 1) The cities with highest train usage have the highest per capita public transport usage and electric rail systems are the most energy efficient mode in Australian cities. 2) There is a significant difference between Australian cities. Perth and Adelaide are at one extreme with high energy (and emissions) per capita, Brisbane and Sydney are at the other extreme and Melbourne is intermediate. 3) These variations were explained by land use characteristics which correlated significantly with the transport patterns and hence suggested a potential to pursue energy conservation and air pollution abatement through land use. 4) The differences between Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney were accounted for by density, centralisation and traffic <b>restraint</b> <b>factors,</b> whilst the anomalous patterns in Brisbane appeared to correlate most with traffic <b>restraint</b> <b>factors.</b> 5) Because traffic restraint seems so important in lowering private vehicle use and giving a competitive edge to public transport it appears that traffic engineering approaches designed to save energy and lower emissions by freeing traffic would be self-defeating...|$|R

40|$|The {{prediction}} {{and control}} of crack widths in reinforced concrete structures {{has been the subject}} of research for many years. However, there is still a lack of consensus on the design of reinforcement for crack control in walls with edge restraint. The paper describes an experimental programme undertaken to investigate the influence of early-age thermal contraction and long-term shrinkage on cracking in four edge-restrained reinforced concrete walls loaded in bending about their major axis. Bending was introduced as a result of initial preload as well as restraint of deflection due to volumetric change. The walls measured 3500 mm long by 180 mm thick with heights of 500 mm and 750 mm. The paper highlights the main findings of the experimental programme and presents the results of nonlinear finite element analysis that was carried out to investigate the effects of wall geometry and reinforcement ratio on crack widths in edge-restrained walls. Results suggest that crack widths in edge-restrained walls are significantly influenced by the wall geometric properties such as wall aspect ratio and wall height which are only indirectly accounted for through the <b>restraint</b> <b>factor</b> in crack width calculations to EN 1992...|$|E

Findings are based on elite interviews with members of senior management in the publishing industry, and triangulated with interviews with authors and academic specialists of Foundation Phase. It was found that the close alignment between government directives and processes and the publishing industry form the core of all LTSM development and production, creating some symbiosis as well as <b>restraints.</b> <b>Factors</b> that shape the production of LTSMs include full compliance with the specific outcomes of the curriculum; producing LTSMs that are affordable in terms of set criteria by selection committees; selection committees that, determine acceptance of LTSMs for placement on approved lists; time frames that preclude in-depth research and trialling, a market that is deeply stratified and where this stratification is reinforced by curriculum imperatives relating to language; and the monitoring of classroom productivity through the filling in of Learner Book worksheets.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to measure the {{exchange}} rate pass-through to domestic prices by using VAR model, and to estimate the long- and short-run and dynamic coefficients of exchange rate pass-through by building the price behavioral equation, which was set up by the error correction model According to results of VAR model estimation, the impact of exchange rate on import, producer, and consumer prices increased after the Korean financial crisis of 1997 - 98. And the estimation of the price behavioral equation model also shows that the exchange rate pass-through to consumer prices grew after the financial crisis. It is found that there has existed an asymmetric effect of exchange rate movements on prices, looking at the aspects that the pass-through coefficients in the rising period of exchange rate have been different from those in the falling period. This evidence implies that even if exchange rate will fall right after it rises for a certain period of time, consumer prices will not recover to the original level or it will, on the contrary, rise. Therefore, policy authorities should, on the process of implementation of monetary policy, keep in mind that this empirical evidence can be a <b>restraint</b> <b>factor</b> in pursuing the price stability...|$|E
40|$|Available online 13 November 2006. This study {{tested the}} {{validity}} of four measures of dietary restraint: Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, Eating Inventory (EI), Revised Restraint Scale (RS), and the Current Dieting Questionnaire. Dietary restraint has been implicated as a determinant of overeating and binge eating. Conflicting findings {{have been attributed to}} different methods for measuring dietary restraint. The validity of four self-report measures of dietary restraint and dieting behavior was tested using: (1) factor analysis, (2) changes in dietary restraint in a randomized controlled trial of different methods to achieve calorie restriction, and (3) correlation of changes in dietary restraint with an objective measure of energy balance, calculated from the changes in fat mass and fat-free mass over a six-month dietary intervention. Scores from all four questionnaires, measured at baseline, formed a dietary <b>restraint</b> <b>factor,</b> but the RS also loaded on a binge eating factor. Based on change scores, the EI Restraint Scale was the only measure that correlated significantly with energy balance expressed as a percentage of energy required for weight maintenance. These findings suggest that, of the four questionnaires tested, the EI Restraint Scale was the most valid measure of the intent to diet and actual caloric restriction. Donald A. Williamson, Corby K.

A sample of 647 Spanish females answered the questionnaire. Both exploratory structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis were used to evaluate the factor structure of the DEBQ. Reliabilities were estimated with Cronbach’s alpha. The relations between the subscales of the DEBQ and age, BMI, and scores on the Eating Attitude Test- 26 (EAT) and the Restrained Scale-Revised (RS) were computed with Pearson correlations. Results showed that the internal structure was similar to the theoretical proposal, although items associated with boredom and idleness presented cross-loading problems. The reliability estimates were satisfactory. The Emotional and External Eating factors correlated with the BMI, and External Eating was negatively correlated with age.

40|$|International audienceThe {{reward system}} is largely {{involved}} in the control of food intake. Whether components of this system (i. e., wanting and liking) change during development remains understudied, {{as well as how}} proximate factors (sensory cues, motivational state) modulate reward reactivity across development. We examined the developmental pattern of wanting and liking for sensorily-cued food stimuli in 6 - 11 year old children {{as a function of the}} child's motivational state (hunger/satiety), gender, and the nature of foods. School children were exposed before or after their lunch on alternative days to visual and odor stimuli representing different categories of familiar foods. Their task was to rate wanting and liking of pictures and odorants of pizza, meat, vegetables, fruits, and chocolate. The following results were found: (1) While liking appeared to be stable from age 6 to 11, more particularly for visually-cued foods, wanting decreased, as well as did subjective hunger perception; (2) there were smaller or absent state-effects in 7 -to- 9 -year-olds; (3) reward ratings were higher in boys than in girls; (4) reward ratings of vegetables were the lowest at all ages. These results suggest that wanting, but not liking, is developmentally variable over childhood, and that this variation depends on age, gender, motivational state (hunger/satiety), the nature of the food and the modality of the sensory cue representing it.

40|$|Abstract Background Verbal and {{physical}} aggressive behaviours {{are among the}} most disturbing and distressing behaviours displayed by older patients in long-term care facilities. Aggressive behaviour (AB) is often the reason for using physical or chemical restraints with nursing home residents and is a major concern for caregivers. AB is associated with increased health care costs due to staff turnover and absenteeism. Methods The goals of this secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study are to determine the prevalence of verbal {{and physical}} aggressive behaviours and to identify associated factors among older adults in long-term care facilities in the Quebec City area (n = 2 332). Results The same percentage of older adults displayed physical aggressive behaviour (21. 2 %) or verbal aggressive behaviour (21. 5 %), whereas 11. 2 % displayed both types of aggressive behaviour. Factors associated with aggressive behaviour (both verbal and physical) were male gender, neuroleptic drug use, mild and severe cognitive impairment, insomnia, psychological distress, and physical <b>restraints.</b> <b>Factors</b> associated with physical aggressive behaviour were older age, male gender, neuroleptic drug use, mild or severe cognitive impairment, insomnia and psychological distress. Finally, factors associated with verbal aggressive behaviour were benzodiazepine and neuroleptic drug use, functional dependency, mild or severe cognitive impairment and insomnia. Conclusion Cognitive impairment severity is the most significant predisposing factor for aggressive behaviour among older adults in long-term care facilities in the Quebec City area. Physical and chemical restraints were also significantly associated with AB. Based on these results, we suggest that caregivers should provide care to older adults with AB using approaches such as the progressively lowered stress threshold model and reactance theory which stress the importance of paying attention to the severity of cognitive impairment and avoiding the use of chemical or physical restraints. </p...|$|R

Aim: To determine whether subjects at risk of eating disorders that are identified as under reporters {{can be considered as}} UR or in turn as restrained eaters. Methods: We determined dietary energy intake, body mass index, body satisfaction, physical activity, psychopathology, dietary <b>restraint</b> <b>factor,</b> weight loss and diagnoses of eating disorders. We applied Goldberg's equations to identify under reporters. Results: 40. 9 % of girls at risk of eating disorders were identified as under reporters and only 7. 3 % were in the control group.

40|$|Advancements {{in digital}} {{technology}} {{have led to}} the development of microprocessor-based relays. However, most of these relays use algorithms similar in principle to their electromechanical counterparts. Also, busbar protection using microprocessor-based relays has not received adequate attention unlike other power system components. Few algorithms proposed for protecting busbars lack inherent immunity to current transformer (ct) saturation. They achieve stability by using additional measures, such as, using special circuitry, multiple algorithms and changing the <b>restraint</b> <b>factor,</b> which are not likely to be effective during severe ct saturation. The impact of ct ratio-mismatch is countered by using percentage-bias characteristics that reduces the sensitivity of the relay. This thesis presents a new technique for protecting busbars. The technique uses positive-sequence and negative-sequence models of the power system in a fault-detection algorithm. While phase voltages and currents are used to detect faults, parameters of the power system are not used. Only the arguments of the positive-sequence and negative-sequence impedances computed by the relay are used to make trip decisions. The performance of the technique was investigated for a variety of operating conditions and for several busbar configurations. Data generated by empty simulations of model power systems were used in the investigations. The results verify that the proposed technique is able to distinguish faults in a busbar protection zone from those outside the zone correctly. Additionally, its stability during ct saturation, immunity to ct ratio-mismatch and applicability, without any modifications, to busbars of different configurations have been established. An analysis of the performance of the proposed technique during ct saturation and ratio-mismatch conditions is presented. The effect of various parameters, such as, presence of d. c. offset in the currents, mild and severe saturation of the cts, different sampling frequencies and the impact of the size of data-windows on the estimates of the current phasors have been included. The analysis indicates that the technique is stable during ct saturation and inherently immune to ct ratio-mismatch. The proposed technique was implemented using a general purpose relay hardware. The hardware and software constituents of the prototype, the procedure for testing these relays by using a playback simulator and selected test results are presented in this thesis...|$|E

O Al 3 + foi o cátion trocável predominante em 32 % dos solos com pH inferior a 5, 6. O H+ titulável em KCl representa formas hydroxi-Al(OH) x de baixa estabilidade e o Al obtido pelo extrator de Wolf-Morgan corresponde ao Al trocável + não-trocável. As formas Al 3 + e hydroxi-Al de baixa estabilidade diminuíram rapidamente com o pH até 5, 5. O Al não-trocável aumentou até pH 4, 5, diminuiu a seguir até pH 5, 5 e aumentou lentamente com o pH de 7, 0 a 7, 5...|$|R
40|$|Structural frame {{systems may}} be {{analyzed}} and designed based on forces from conventional first order theory when second order effects of axial forces on displacements in the compression {{members of the}} system are negligible. This is often the case. Extensive nonlinear analysis results are presented to document slenderness limits below which this is so for braced, end moment loaded compression members with various end <b>restraints.</b> Major <b>factors</b> that affect lower slenderness limit predictions of such members are investigated and a new lower slenderness limit is proposed and verified against the nonlinear results. Slenderness is {{defined in terms of}} a socalled normalized slenderness that, in addition to the geometrical slenderness, is a function of axial force and reinforcement. The limit itself {{is a function of the}} first order end moment ratio. The formulation is rational and the proposed limits are generally found to be more reliable than existing lower limit formulations...|$|R
40|$|In flavour¿flavour {{learning}} (FFL), repeated co-experience {{of a novel}} flavour and a hedonically valanced flavour {{can lead}} to changes in liking for the novel flavour. Some studies suggest that restrained eaters are insensitive to FFL, while disinhibited eaters may over respond to hedonic stimuli. Here we assessed FFL through associations between food-related odours and sweet and bitter tastes to explore further how eating attitudes influence FFL. 52 women, pre-selected to be high or low on the <b>restraint</b> and disinhibition <b>factors</b> from the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), evaluated two novel odours orthonasally before experiencing retronasal pairings of one odour with sucrose and the second with quinine before orthonasal re-evaluation of the odours. At post-training, overall liking increased for the sucrose-paired odour but this effect was greater in women with high scores on the TFEQ disinhibition factor. Liking for the quinine-paired odour decreased equally in all groups. The sucrose-paired odour was rated as sweeter, and quinine-paired odour more bitter at post-training and these acquired sensory qualities were unaffected by <b>restraint</b> or disinhibition <b>factors</b> from the TFEQ. Overall, these data {{found no evidence of}} impaired FFL in restrained women, but instead found greater responsiveness to hedonic qualities of sucrose in women scoring high on the disinhibition factor, consistent with suggestions that this factor identifies individuals with heightened hedonic sensitivity to food...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{remote sensing}} {{data of the}} Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in the years of 1991, 2001 and 2008, the paper built an index system of land use {{potential}} <b>restraint</b> <b>factors</b> in YRD, according to geological condition, terrain condition, water area, natural reserve area and basic farmland, and evaluated construction land potential based on the platform of GIS spatial analysis model. The results showed that: (1) the construction land increased rapidly since 1991 and reached 24, 951. 21 km(2) in 2008, or 21. 27 % of the total area. Among all the cities in the YRD, Shanghai took the greatest percentage, followed by Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Spatially, areas where government departments are located became the growth center of construction land. Prefecture-level cities were the fastest growth region and the changing trend showed circle layered characteristics and significant increase with Shanghai and Suzhou as the core. (2) The higher the quality of construction land potentials (CLP), the smaller the number of CLP units. High sensitive area accounted for the largest percentage (40. 14 %) among all types of constraint regions and {{this was followed by}} medium sensitive region (31. 53 %) of the whole region. (3) The comprehensive CLP in the YRD was 24, 989. 65 km(2), or 21. 76 % of the total YRD. The land use potential showed spatial distribution imbalance. CLP of Zhejiang was obviously larger than that of Jiangsu. CLP was insufficient in regional central city. Moreover, CLP in the YRD formed a circle layered spatial pattern that increasingly expanded centered in prefecture-level cities. Low potential area expanded from north to south. High potential area was mainly located in south YRD. Areas with zero potential in the YRD formed a northwest-southeast "Y-shaped" spatial pattern in north Hangzhou Bay. (4) CLP per capita in YRD was 0. 045 ha/person and also unevenly distributed. Some 25. 57 % of the study units at county level nearly had no construction land and 8. 24 % of the units had CLP per capita below the national average level. CLP per capita in less than 25 % of the county-level units was larger than the YRD average level, which were mainly located in Zhejiang. Therefore, research on the construction potential area in YRD was favorable for analysis of the development status and potential space of this region under the background of rapid urbanization and industrialization...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between gender and institutions {{within the context of}} Nepal’s labor migration. Labor migration is an important issue for Nepal’s economy as nearly 10 % of the population works abroad (Sijapati, 2012). However, only 10 % of these migrants are women, creating a gender imbalance. One reason for the large disparity between the number of female migrants and male migrants is explained by legal <b>restraints</b> and institutional <b>factors.</b> A potentially more potent reason for the lack of female migrants working abroad can be credited to gender roles and cultural values in Nepali society (Thieme, 2005).

40|$|Use of {{driver seat}} belts and {{availability}} and functionality of passenger seat belts in {{a convenience sample}} of 231 Beijing taxis were examined in the months prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. Driver and front passenger seat belt use was mandated in China from 2004 to help address the growing public health crisis of road trauma. Results from observations made by in-vehicle passengers revealed that 21. 2 % of drivers were correctly wearing a belt, approximately half were not, and one third were using the belt in a non-functional way. Over ¾ of this sample of taxi drivers were unrestrained while working. The percentage of functionally available belts was higher for front than rear passengers (88. 3 % and 22. 9 % respectively). This low rate of belt availability in rear seats calls into question the preparedness of the fleet to cater for the safety needs of foreign visitors to China, particularly those from countries with high levels of <b>restraint</b> use. <b>Factors</b> influencing the use/misuse of seat belts in China remain largely unexplored. Results of this pilot study support further investigations of barriers to using injury prevention mechanisms such as seat belts in less motorised countries...|$|R
40|$|The First Gulf War {{initiated}} the re-opening {{of the internal}} political debate in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) about the deployment of armed forces abroad and represented a culmination point that challenged the existing course of German foreign and security policy. This bachelor thesis reconstructs the process of German government decision making, concerning {{the form of the}} German contribution to the solution of the Iraqi-Kuwait crisis using the theoretical concept of two-level game introduced by Robert Putnam. The thesis focuses on the following questions: which factors and to what extent formed the final German position and how did the final decision influence the international position of Germany and the course of its foreign and security policy? Finding itself in a difficult political situation at the time (unification process), the FRG decided, in spite of its foreign legal commitments and the expectations of international allies, to pursue a strategy of military abstention and supported the operation through financial and material means. The final German position was formed especially by the internal specifics: cognitive <b>factors</b> (culture of <b>restraint),</b> normative <b>factors</b> (restrictions given by the Basic Law), institutional factors (form of the internal ratification process and [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective The aim of {{the present}} study was to find out the extent of hostility and {{violence}} and the factors that are associated with such hostility and violence in a psychiatric intensive care unit. Methods Retrospective analysis of data prospectively collected in a 6 -year period. Results No hostility was observed in 56. 1 %, hostility in 40. 9 %, and violence in 3. 0 % of the admitted cases. Seclusion was never used. Six cases (2, 5 ‰) required physical <b>restraint.</b> Risk <b>factors</b> associated with violence were younger age, suicidal risk, and diagnosis of schizophrenia. Risk factors associated with hostile and violent behavior were younger age at the onset of the disorder, being single, having no children, lower GAF scores, higher BPRS hostility, SAPS, and CGI scores, lower BPRS anxiety-depression score, higher doses of psychoactive drugs, more frequent use of neuroleptics, diagnosis of mania, personality disorder, substance and alcohol related disorders, no diagnosis of depression. Conclusion The study confirms the low rate of violence among Italian psychiatric in-patients, the major relevance of clinical rather than socio-demographic factors in respect of aggressive behavior, the possibility of a no seclusion-no physical restraint policy, not associated either with higher rates of hostility or violence or with more severe drug side effects. </p...|$|R
30|$|All {{available}} information {{as well as}} evaluations by experts of supporting and precaution-oriented issues (e.g. in-depth studies or thematic field calls) should be concisely prepared and embedded in the German context (ITA preliminary study). Moreover, the short study shows potential opportunities and risks and provides an early diagnosis of potential <b>restraints</b> and supporting <b>factors</b> for innovations. Based on this problem analysis, concrete proposals for the methodological identification of an ITA need were developed. Thus, the short study does not represent an ITA study, but an extensive situation analysis (the state of science and technology) with specific proposals for the methodical update or specification of ITA objectives (cf. [21]). The methodological recommendations of the short studies set the ground for an in-depth ITA analysis. These studies were then developed during the third phase of the project for all fifteen topics specified by the BMBF (cf. Table  1).|$|R

40|$|This study {{directly}} tested {{implications of}} motivation intensity theory on effort to restrain against a behavioral urge or impulse (i. e. <b>restraint</b> intensity). Two <b>factors</b> were manipulated—magnitude of an urge {{and the importance}} of successfully resisting it—with cardiovascular (CV) responses related to active coping measured. Male and female undergraduate students were presented with a mildly- or strongly evocative film clip with instructions to refrain from showing any facial response. Success was made more or less important through coordinated manipulations of outcome expectancy, ego-involvement, and performance assessment. As expected, systolic blood pressure responses assessed during the performance period were proportional to the evocativeness of the clip when importance was high, but low regardless of evocativeness when importance was low. These findings support a new conceptual analysis concerned with the determinants and CV correlates of restraint intensity. Implications of the study and associations with current self-regulatory literature are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Consistent {{relationships}} {{have been demonstrated}} between problem drinking and certain personality characteristics. A contemporary cognitive model of alcohol misuse, drinking restraint, has recently shown promise in furthering our understanding of problematic drinking. This study examined the potential association between drinking restraint and personality characteristics in 168 alcohol dependent inpatients. Subjects completed the short-scale Revised Eysenck Personality Scales (EPS-R; Eysenck, Eysenck, & Barrett, 1985), Temptation and Restraint Inventory (TRI; Collins & Lapp, 1992), Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS; Skinner & Allen, 1982) and drinking measures including quantity, frequency and weekly drinking total. Results indicated that although there was some conceptual overlap between drinking <b>restraint</b> and personality <b>factors,</b> the TRI had a unique relationship with indices of problem drinking once personality factors were taken into account. This indicates that restrained drinking and personality, although related, are discrete constructs. While restrained drinking may aid {{in the understanding of}} current drinking behavior, personality characteristics appear to contribute to the etiology and maintenance of drinking problems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{etiology}} of patellofemoral pain is likely related to pathological femoral shape and soft-tissue <b>restraints</b> imbalance. These <b>factors</b> {{may result in}} various maltracking patterns in patients with patellofemoral pain. Thus, we hypothesized that femoral shape influences patellofemoral kinematics, but that this influence differs between kinematically unique subgroups of patients with patellofemoral pain. 3 D MRIs of 30 knees with patellofemoral pain and maltracking (‘‘maltrackers’’) and 33 knees of asymptomatic subjects were evaluated, retrospectively. Dynamic MRI was acquired during a flexion-extension task. Maltrackers {{were divided into two}} subgroups (nonlateral and lateral maltrackers) based on previously defined kinematic criteria. Nine measures of femoral trochlear shape and two measures of patellar shape were quantified. These measures were correlated with patellofemoral kinematics. Differences were found in femoral shape between the maltracking and asymptomatic cohorts. Femoral shape parameters were associated with patellar kinematics in patients with patellofemoral pain and maltracking, but the correlations were unique across subgroups within this population. The ability to better categorize patients with patellofemoral pain will likely improve treatment by providing a more specific {{etiology of}} maltracking in individua...|$|R

MethodIn this study, 238 normal-weight adults (82 % women; Mean age = 36. 6, SD = 15. 0) participated in an online survey containing measures of <b>Restraint</b> Scale, Three <b>Factor</b> Eating Questionnaire, Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, and Body Dissatisfaction and Drive for Thinness scales. ResultsExploratory factor analyses corroborated the two-factors structure found in previous studies, in particular when three items without clear factorial assignment and low correlation were excluded. A final two-factors version of the RS containing seven items presented a very good fit to the measurement model and good internal consistency. Confirmatory factor analysis of the 7 -items RS in relation to a three-factor model of overeating, dieting and body dissatisfaction measures revealed that the RS was the only restraint measure loading in all three factors. ConclusionThis suggests that the 7 -items Portuguese version of the RS has good psychometric properties and unique features that lend it appropriate to identify and study unsuccessful chronic dieters...|$|R
