40|$|Abstract- Today, {{occupational}} {{accidents are}} {{considered among the}} potential threats because of their serious humanitarian, economic, social, and environmental consequences. Occupational accidents and injuries are the third cause of mortality in world. In addition, the economic and environmental damages because <b>of</b> the occupational <b>accidents</b> are catastrophic too. According to International Labor Organization (ILO) report in 1999 the number <b>of</b> fatal <b>accidents</b> was 335000. Though the <b>registered</b> number <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> cannot be a faultless account <b>of</b> all the <b>accidents</b> happened, but in 2000, about 12000 work related accidents have been registered by the Department of Social Security. Calculations indicated that approximately 345000 fatal occupational accidents occurred in 1998 and that over 260 million occupational accidents causing at least 3 days absence happened in the same year. This work aims to study the relation of occupational stress of workers and the accidents in a rice milling industry. The data was collected using questionnaire. The questionnaire contained 30 questions to measure {{the perceptions of the}} employees about the management practices. A five point likert scale was used. This was prepared based on review of related literature. The contents of this draft questionnaire were discussed with senior professional in the industry. Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20 software. Descriptive statistics and correlations of the studied variables were first analyzed. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to verify the reliability. Regression analysis was conducted to test the goodness of fit of the various models...|$|R

The buildings have been switched to big industrialhall- like constructions from small-scale ones which have contained own timber and own work contribution. The objective of the project financed by Farmers' Social Insurance Institution was to improve occupational safety on farm building construction and renovation sites by disseminating current safety practices and by developing ways of action which are better than the prevailing ones. The project consisted of a literature review, statistical analysis, {{as well as a}} farmer and designer interviews. In the statistical analysis the MATA occupational injuries insurance claims database on farmers’ claims during construction and renovation work for the years 2005 - 2008 was compared with the <b>register</b> <b>of</b> Federation <b>of</b> <b>Accident</b> Insurance Institutions on the construction workers' injuries. In comparing the reasons <b>of</b> the <b>accidents</b> a clear difference was found; poor scaffoldings and ladders are still the main culprits on farm accidents. Farmer interviews were used to assess occupational safety measures on the construction site, occurred injuries and their types, nearmiss situations and the underlying factors which have led to the injuries. Also construction safety deficiencies as well as the direct and indirect costs caused for instance because of the delay in completion of construction project were discussed. Designer interviews aimed to find out how occupational safety and health considerations are taken into account in farm building planning and counseling, and how this experience of the designers should be utilized in order to improve safety at the construction sites on farms. Farmers knew their obligations on occupational safety poorly. The situation was further worsened by the fact that on the site the supervisor tasks were only nominally executed. The designers knew the occupational health and safety legislation better but this did not help the situation on the sites because designers are not generally involved in the actual implementation of the construction project...|$|R

40|$|From {{the aspect}} of safety at work, we {{consider}} the timber transport under the risky works. Data about accidents at work in forestry for the period 1996 – 2014 were summarized. The database contained more than 1500 work accidents in forestry. Laboratory Accident Coding Methodology was used, according to European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW). In total, 105 registered work accidents in timber transport, during the investigated period, were recorded. This correspond to 7 % share <b>of</b> <b>registered</b> work <b>accidents.</b> From the anthropological aspect, the legs and whole body were most frequently injured. The highest number <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> on Tuesday were recorded, with the most risk month of February. The highest accident rate in 2002 were recorded.

During the interviews with senior staff members, we discover that particularly city safety cars are mentioned by most of the specialists. Other important factors highlighted were mileage, weather, company car/ private car and age of a car.   City Safety is a technology designed to help the driver mitigate, and in certain situations avoid, collisions at low speed by automatically bracking the vehicle. The estimated claim rate frequency i. e. claims per contract rate was 50 % lower for city safety equipped; then other warranty cars models without system. The study also analysis the effect of rain, mean temperature and snow on Volvo Body part sales in Stockholm Sweden. Temperature snow impacted road accidents significantly. Snow was shown to be the leading variable, as the number <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> increases sharply with increased snowfall. Temperature is the second important variable in the list i. e. as the temperature decreases by 1 ͦC the sales of body and paint business in Stockholm increases by 1. 6 %.   Time variable such as weekday, month, and year also plays significant role in this model.

40|$|In {{an earlier}} phase <b>of</b> {{research}} into <b>accidents</b> in which cars {{end up in}} water, {{it appeared that the}} number and severity <b>of</b> this <b>accident</b> type were sufficiently large (See ITRD E 206739). In this follow-up study, an attempt is made to gain insight into the escape and rescue problems of a specifically vehicle-technic nature after immersion events. This aim was formulated because, from reported accidents, it can be deduced that electronic provisions, such as central door locking devices and anti-hijack locks on doors, possibly {{play a role in the}} drowning of occupants. At the same time, foreign literature and foreign <b>accident</b> data (especially <b>of</b> other European countries) were used to determine the extent and nature of the problem. From this literature study and the search for these data, it was established that the problem of motor vehicle immersions, in eight other European countries, was of only a limited size. The international literature only contained sporadic, relevant research results. To study the problems of escape and rescue from cars after immersion, a file study was carried out. This used summonses <b>of</b> <b>registered</b> <b>accidents</b> for 2000 : 137 files made up by the police were each examined individually. Against all expectations, the file study showed that in not one single file was mention made of a specific vehicle feature as the cause of escape or rescue problems. This, however, does not mean that the problem does not exist. This is all the more so because, for a number of the relevant vehicle features (such as the electronic anti-hijack locks), not many had then been installed. As a result of the file study, it was emphatically determined that accidents involving car immersions are complicated. The serious nature <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> involving car immersions leads to recommend taking primarily preventative regarding infrastructure and vehicle safety.
