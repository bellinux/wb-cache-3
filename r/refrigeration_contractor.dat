5000|$|Kenneth Ray Westerfield {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, to Margaret Marion (née Beach) a {{clerical}} administrator for {{the public school system}} and his father Gene C. Westerfield, a trade school trained <b>refrigeration</b> <b>contractor</b> in a family owned business of refrigeration and air conditioning. In the late fifties, the family moved from Detroit to Livonia, Michigan, now twelve years old, he lived with his parents and younger sister Kathy, who graduated from Winston Churchill High School in 1972 and has made a career in special education. Born into a close, middle class, conservative household, Westerfield attended area public schools and was active in many sports. His father, whose father Cleo Conn Westerfield played baseball for the Detroit Street Railway League in the 1920s, was very active in sports himself. This contributed to Westerfield's early sporting interest. Sports in the order of interest, along with all disc sports, were baseball, hockey, motorcycles, golf and basketball in which he competed in several city leagues. It was at age thirteen, in 1960, that Westerfield became best friends with Hall of Fame and Discraft founder Jim Kenner. They began playing Frisbee in high school. Daily they would experiment with new ways of throwing and catching the Frisbee, this would later be called [...] "playing freestyle". In the sixties, when the Frisbee was still considered a toy used just for recreation, there wasn't a reason to become proficient at throwing a Frisbee, no Frisbee professionals to emulate or disc sport tournaments to compete in. The only reason they became as good as they were was because of their shared anti-establishment attitude and lifestyle (that also included the rejection of traditional sports in general). This would result in a proficiency at playing Frisbee that had never been seen before. They would later invent competitive formats introducing disc sports that would display the results of their flying disc playing abilities.|$|E

40|$|Managing {{the returns}} process {{effectively}} {{can lead to}} cost reduction and revenues increase {{even if it is}} often considered as a peripheral activity in the supply chain. This paper investigates the relation between returns management and customer satisfaction in a business-to-business (B 2 B) context. Building on the inter-organisational justice perspective, a model that links the characteristics of the returns management system, the system performance, and customer satisfaction is developed. The proposed conceptual model was tested using data collected through a survey of 192 heating, ventilation, air conditioning and <b>refrigeration</b> (HVAC-R) <b>contractors</b> in Canada. Results indicate that: i) the level of administrative support provided by the suppliers to assist the contractors (i. e., the customers) with the returns process is predominant in generating the customer satisfaction; ii) the performance of returns management system is significantly and positively linked to customer satisfaction. Implications for future research and managers are also discussed. returns management; customer satisfaction; inter-organisational justice; PLS; partial least squares; business-to-business; B 2 B; system performance; Canada; administrative support; HVAC-R contractors...|$|R
50|$|Beck {{was born}} in Toowoomba. He worked as a <b>refrigeration</b> and {{electrical}} <b>contractor</b> in rural Queensland until settling in the Tweed River area in the early 1960s. He served two terms on the Tweed Shire Council prior to winning National Party pre-selection for the seat of Byron before the general election of 1984. He subsequently won the seat replacing the previous member, Jack Boyd. The seat was abolished prior to the 1988 election and Beck was then elected the member for Murwillumbah. He held this seat until it was abolished in 1999. Beck then contested Tweed, which was basically a reconfigured version of his old seat. However, he was defeated by Labor's Neville Newell.|$|R
