The inner cylinder (rotor) is eccentrically deposited and its movement is composed of two movements (rotation and precession). The outer cylinder is stationary and has <b>radial</b> <b>grooves.</b> In the first phase is defined a mathematical model of the flow, which is then applied to the 3 D model of narrow gap with <b>radial</b> <b>grooves.</b> In this paper are present several variants of the computational domain {{with regard to the}} number of <b>radial</b> <b>grooves.</b> Based on the results of numerical simulations are evaluated basic variables such as pressure and velocity. There are also evaluated radial force (Fr) and axial force (Fa) acting on the rotor for different boundary conditions (different speeds of rotation and precession). Subsequently, the pressure gradients (Δp) are evaluated between the <b>radial</b> <b>grooves</b> for different computational domain. Results are compared to variant of narrow gap without <b>radial</b> <b>grooves.</b> Numerical simulation is realized in the program system ANSYS Fluent...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} control and {{suppress}} rotating stall in a vaneless diffuser of centrifugal turbomachine, a new passive device by use of <b>radial</b> shallow <b>grooves</b> is proposed and the effect is studied experimentally and theoretically. The {{results show that the}} <b>radial</b> <b>grooves</b> of 3 mm depth suppress rotating stall completely over the all flow ranges. The <b>radial</b> <b>grooves</b> of only 1 mm depth on both sidewalls can also suppress rotating stall : Theoretical considerations have revealed that this remarkable effect of <b>radial</b> <b>grooves</b> is caused by the following two mechanisms; one is a significant decrease in tangential velocity due to the mixing between the main flow and the groove flow, and the other is an increase in radial velocity due to the reverse flow in the grooves...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{numerical}} flow calculations {{with respect to}} the annular gaps with added <b>radial</b> <b>grooves</b> normaly used on the spools of directional control valves were carried out. The impact of various annular gap geometries and <b>radial</b> <b>grooves</b> during variable pressure conditions, and while using different hydraulic fluids, on the flows through annular gaps were investigated for different flow regimes. Samples with different geometries and numbers of radial groves on the spool of the directional control valve were also made for the purpose of carrying out flow measurements. The two different hydraulic fluids that were used in the numerical simulations and for the flow measurements were a hydraulic mineral oil and tap water. The results of the numerical calculations for the different models of the <b>radial</b> <b>grooves</b> with axially symmetric geometries show their impact on the internal leakage with respect to three different regimes of flow.

50|$|The radial nerve, {{which is}} from the fifth {{cervical}} spinal nerve to the first thoracic spinal nerve, originates as {{the continuation of the}} posterior cord of the brachial plexus.

40|$|Abstract. The {{non-linear}} {{relationship between}} the magnetic field intensity and magnetostrictive strain which {{is caused by the}} thermal expansion produced by the eddy current loss in the GMM rod, will affect the precision and stability of GMM actuator. This paper tries to reduce the eddy current loss in the GMM rod to improve the performance of magnetostrictive actuator by machining <b>radial</b> <b>grooves</b> in the surface of the rod. The numerical results show that the axial grooves can be effective in reducing thermal power loss. The groove size and number are both optimized by numerical method. The results show that the groove depth and number has great impact on the unit volume eddy current loss while the groove width has little or no impact. The test of the magnetostrictive strain shows that the linearity of the GMM rod with grooves is significantly improved. The <b>radial</b> <b>grooves</b> in the GMM surface can reduce the eddy current loss and improve the performance of GMM actuator...|$|R

40|$|Projection {{photolithography}} {{has been}} used as a fabrication method for radial grove gratings. Use of photolithographic method for diffraction grating fabrication represents the most significant breakthrough in grating technology in the last 60 years, since the introduction of holographic written gratings. Unlike traditional methods utilized for grating fabrication, this method has the advantage of producing complex diffractive groove contours that can be designed at pixel-by-pixel level, with pixel size currently at the level of 45 45 nm. Typical placement accuracy of the grating pixels is 10 nm over 30 nm. It is far superior to holographic, mechanically ruled or direct e-beam written gratings and results in high spatial coherence and low spectral cross-talk. Due to the smooth surface produced by reactive ion etch, such gratings have a low level of randomly scattered light. Also, due to high fidelity and good surface roughness, this method is ideally suited for fabrication of <b>radial</b> <b>groove</b> gratings. The projection mask is created using a laser writer. A single crystal silicon wafer is coated with photoresist, and then the projection mask, with its layer of photoresist, is exposed for patterning in a stepper or scanner. To develop the photoresist, the fabricator either removes the exposed areas (positive resist) of the unexposed areas (negative resist). Next, the patterned and developed photoresist silicon substrate is subjected to reactive ion etching. After this step, the substrate is cleaned. The projection mask is fabricated according to electronic design files that may be generated in GDS file format using any suitable CAD (computer-aided design) or other software program. <b>Radial</b> <b>groove</b> gratings in off-axis grazing angle of incidence mount are of special interest for x-ray spectroscopy, as they allow achieving higher spectral resolution for the same grating area and have lower alignment tolerances than traditional in-plane grating scheme. This is especially critical for NASA Constellation- X project that will utilize hundreds of gratings all of which need to be precisely aligned for x-ray observation of space...|$|E
