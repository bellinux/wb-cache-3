40|$|Many {{recent studies}} have used long bone {{cross-sectional}} geometric properties in various comparative analyses. Methods have been described for reconstructing diaphyseal cross sections from external molds and biplanar radiographs that produce accurate results (within 5 % of true values on average).

This study compares cross-sectional properties calculated using the new <b>R</b> <b>program</b> to those from peripheral quantitative CT (pQCT) and the original manual method. We find that the <b>R</b> <b>program</b> works aswell as the original manual image processing for most cross sections eliminates the chance for entry errors at several steps and greatly speeds up data collection...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} with broiler chickens in a nested design of two feeding programs [ad libitum (AL) or restriction (R) ] and two strains of chicks. The Trial 1 <b>R</b> <b>program</b> was 50 % AL rate from 6 to 14 days of age fed to Strains A and B. The trial 2 <b>R</b> <b>program</b> was 65 % AL rate from 8 to 14 days of age fed to Strain B and C. A computer-controlled feeding system was used to regulate the <b>R</b> <b>program</b> in each trial. Broilers on R programs exhibited compensatory growth at 21, 35, and 45 days of age equivalent to that of AL programs in both trials. Feed efficiency was not affected in Trial 1 by broilers fed R (1. 68) versus AL (1. 73) at 42 days but was significantly affected at 63 days (R = 2. 15 and AL = 1. 93). Trial 2 showed no significant effect of R (1. 89) versus AL (2. 01) on feed efficiency. Strain effects on carcass yield was determined only at 42 days in Trial 1. Feeding program did not affect percentage carcass fat (Trial 1) or abdominal fat pad size (Trial 2). Feed restriction did significantly improve percentage bone ash in Trial 2.
