40|$|Abstract: Suspen-dome {{is a kind}} of large-span {{prestressed}} hybrid structure, To {{understand the}} influence of radial <b>restraining</b> stiffness to structural mechanical response, and to ensure radial <b>restraining</b> stiffness reliable during designing, a rib 3 type suspen-dome and corresponding single layer lattice shell were selected, their static response under different radial <b>restraining</b> stiffness were studied and compared. At the same time, basic dynamic properties of a rib 3 type suspen-dome were analyzed under different radial <b>restraining</b> stiffness. The results show that the sensitivity of single layer dome mechanical response to radial <b>restraining</b> stiffness will be reduced because of the bottom cable-struts, enhance of radial <b>restraining</b> stiffness will not influence structural mechanical response after radial <b>restraining</b> stiffness reaches certain value...|$|R

40|$|Distortional {{buckling}} {{is one of}} {{the important}} buckling models of steel-concrete composite beam in negative moment region. Rotation <b>restraining</b> rigidity and lateral <b>restraining</b> rigidity which steel beam web to bottom plate of steel-concrete composite are the key factors to influence the distortional buckling behavior. A comprehensive and intensive study on rotation <b>restraining</b> rigidity and lateral <b>restraining</b> rigidity which steel beam web to bottom plate of I-shaped steel-concrete composite beam in negative moment region is conducted in this paper. Energy variation principle is adopted to deduce the analytical expressions to calculate the rotation <b>restraining</b> rigidity and lateral <b>restraining</b> rigidity. Combined with the buckling theory of axial compression thin-walled bars in elastic medium, the buckling moment is obtained. Theoretical analysis shows that the rotation <b>restraining</b> rigidity and lateral <b>restraining</b> rigidity of steel beam web appear to have a linear relationship with the external loads and could also be negative. Compared with other methods, the results calculated by the proposed expressions agree well with the numerical results by ANSYS. The proposed expressions are more concise and suitable than the existing formulas for the engineering application...|$|R

5000|$|In the US, {{each state}} {{has its own}} <b>restraining</b> order laws, {{but they tend to}} be divided into about four main types. Not every state will have every type of <b>restraining</b> order on the books. A {{domestic}} violence <b>restraining</b> order generally protects only parties deemed to be in some form of [...] "domestic" [...] relationship which may, depending on the statute, include a family, household, intimate, or sexual relationship. A sexual assault <b>restraining</b> order specifically protects a victim of sexual assault regardless of what relationship may or may not exist between petitioner and respondent. If her state has no sexual assault <b>restraining</b> order statute, she may still qualify for a domestic violence <b>restraining</b> order if the sexual assault occurred {{in the context of a}} domestic relationship or if the statute is written sufficiently broad. In such cases, sexual assault survivors can sometimes qualify for domestic violence <b>restraining</b> orders because any act of sexual intercourse between petitioner and respondent, even during rape, legally establishes the required sexually intimate relationship. Harassment and stalking <b>restraining</b> orders also generally do not require any specific relationship to exist or not exist between the parties, but also may not be available in all states. These types of <b>restraining</b> orders also generally require at least two instances of, respectively, harassment or stalking to qualify. [...] In many cases, one statute may cover more than one type of <b>restraining</b> order. For example, what is called a harassment <b>restraining</b> order in Wisconsin also specifically includes cases of sexual assault and stalking.|$|R

5000|$|Experts {{disagree}} on whether <b>restraining</b> orders {{are effective in}} preventing further harassment. A 2010 analysis published in the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law reviewed 15 U.S. studies of <b>restraining</b> order effectiveness, and concluded that <b>restraining</b> orders [...] "can serve a useful role in threat management". However, a 2002 analysis of 32 U.S. studies found that <b>restraining</b> orders are violated an average of 40 {{percent of the time}} and are perceived as being [...] "followed by worse events" [...] almost 21 percent of the time, and concluded that [...] "evidence of orders' relative efficacy is lacking", and that they may pose some degree of risk. Other studies have found that <b>restraining</b> orders offer little or no deterrent against future interpersonal violence.

5000|$|Threat {{management}} {{experts are}} often suspicious of <b>restraining</b> orders, believing they may escalate or enrage stalkers.

[...] De Becker also observed that <b>restraining</b> orders are most effective when the emotional involvement is lowest—for example, when used following a brief, unsatisfactory, dating relationship as opposed to with an ex-spouse. In the case of stalking, de Becker advised that <b>restraining</b> orders are most effective if the woman rejects once, and then obtains the <b>restraining</b> order immediately following any further unwanted contact. If she continues to allow contact {{for an extended period}} after an initial firm rejection, any eventual <b>restraining</b> order may be less effective.|$|R
