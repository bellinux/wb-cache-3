5|$|Below the {{regional}} level, all of England {{is divided into}} 48 ceremonial counties. These are used primarily as a geographical frame of <b>reference</b> <b>and</b> have developed gradually since the Middle Ages, with some established as recently as 1974. Each has a Lord Lieutenant and High Sheriff; these posts are used to represent the British monarch locally. Outside Greater London and the Isles of Scilly, England is also divided into 83 metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties; these correspond to areas used {{for the purposes of}} local government and may consist of a single district or be divided into several.|$|E
5|$|Cobb has {{consistently}} opposed the splitting {{of education and}} knowledge into discrete and insulated disciplines and departments. He believes that the current university model encourages excessive abstraction because each specialized area of study defines its own frame of <b>reference</b> <b>and</b> then tends to ignore the others, discouraging interdisciplinary dialogue and inhibiting a broad understanding of the world.|$|E
5|$|In {{philosophy}} of mind, Putnam {{is known for}} his argument against the type-identity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability of the mental, and for the concept of functionalism, an influential theory regarding the mindâ€“body problem. In {{philosophy of}} language, along with Saul Kripke and others, he developed the causal theory of <b>reference,</b> <b>and</b> formulated an original theory of meaning, introducing the notion of semantic externalism based on a famous thought experiment called Twin Earth.|$|E

40|$|A {{challenge}} {{to the value of}} <b>referencing</b> <b>and</b> citations is sometimes heard in design research circles. This challenge questions the value of good <b>referencing</b> <b>and</b> citations to research and practice in design. This article will address the misunderstandings that give rise to these challenges. This article outlines the foundations of <b>referencing</b> <b>and</b> citation. It clarifies central issues in <b>referencing</b> <b>and</b> citation. It discusses literature review as an exercise linked to good <b>referencing</b> <b>and</b> it offers resources and tools for design research. Most important, it discusses the role of evidence in analyzing and solving problems in design research. While some design problems involve taste and interpretation, most design arguments rest on statements of fact. Statements of fact have truth-value established by evidence. References make evidence accessible distinct from the person and claims of the writer. By providing evidence for reasoned argument, good <b>referencing</b> <b>and</b> citation serves both the field of design practice and the discipline of design research. Good referencing is central to the growing literature of design research for four main reasons: reasoned argument, access to common evidence, building the field, and improving the intellectual and practical quality of the discipline...|$|R

5|$|The {{ability of}} {{children}} to extract information from their environment rests on understandings of attentional behaviors such as pointing. Episodes of joint attention provide children {{with a great deal}} of information about objects by establishing <b>reference</b> <b>and</b> intention. Joint attention occurs within particular environments. The items and events in that environment provide a context that enables the child to associate meaning with a particular utterance. Joint attention makes relevant aspects of the context salient, helping children comprehend what is taking place.|$|E

The Attorney-General is required to assist the Tribunal in the hearing of the <b>reference,</b> <b>and</b> the President may be represented by such legal counsel as the Tribunal may appoint, after consulting the President. The parties appearing before the Tribunal are {{not confined to the}} President and the Attorney-General. The Tribunal may direct that the hearing of a reference be notified to any interested person or, where there is an interested class of persons, to one or more representatives of the class. If there is any interest that is affected which is not represented by counsel, the Tribunal may request that counsel argue the case for this interest.|$|E
5|$|Although Fodor {{originally}} {{rejected the}} idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, he has in recent years devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of <b>reference</b> <b>and</b> his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposes reductive accounts of the mind. He argues that mental states are multiply realizable {{and that there is}} a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He has also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterizes as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theory of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided {{that they could not}} wait for him to finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and wanted to do something new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for <b>reference,</b> <b>and</b> the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{new game}} is set within a {{well-established}} franchise, Starbreeze tried {{to retain the}} essence of the world and rebuild these elements. The game's story was written by British science-fiction writer Richard K Morgan, whom the team approached after they read his book Altered Carbon. Syndicate was Morgan's second video-game script after 2011's Crysis 2; he used the original game for <b>reference</b> <b>and</b> included elements that those who had played it would immediately recognize. He preserved the original's dystopian setting and theme, and hoped to use these elements to build a powerful story. Morgan traveled to Sweden to meet Starbreeze's game designers to ensure the game's story would not contradict its overall design.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{production}} designer Richard Hudolin flew to Los Angeles, 1996 {{to gather}} material from Stargate for <b>reference</b> <b>and</b> found the original film prop stored {{outside in the}} Californian desert. Although the prop had severely disintegrated, he could take a detailed mould for Stargate SG-1 production to build its own prop. The new Stargate was engineered to turn, lock the chevrons, and be computer-controlled to dial specific gate addresses. A portable Stargate prop was built for on-location shoots and required six workers and one full day to set up. Since visual effects are sometimes faster and cheaper, a computer-generated Stargate was occasionally used in on-location shoots in later seasons.|$|E

5|$|The Briarcliff {{library is}} open seven days per week, except in August {{when it is}} closed each Sunday. The library hosts four {{computer}} workstations and eight laptops, and has its own WiFi network. The library's director oversees two and three-quarters full-time and eight part-time employees, including <b>reference</b> <b>and</b> youth librarians. The library is governed by a seven-member board, with a liaison to the village board. Services include computer classes, book discussion groups, young adult programs, a children's room, and a local history collection. Library spending constitutes about four percent of the village budget. Community members support the library through the Friends of the Briarcliff Manor Public Library organization. The organization's volunteers have helped shelve, repair, and check out books, provided art shows, sponsored adult discussion groups, and participated {{in all of the}} library's fundraising campaigns.|$|E
5|$|The Rolling Stones have assimilated various musical genres {{into their}} own {{collective}} sound. Throughout the band's career, their musical contributions have been marked by a continual <b>reference</b> <b>and</b> reliance on musical styles including blues, psychedelia, R, country, folk, reggae, dance, and world music, exemplified by Jones' collaboration with the Master Musicians of Jajouka, as well as traditional English styles that use stringed instrumentation like harps. Brian Jones experimented {{with the use of}} non-traditional instruments such as the sitar and slide guitar in their early days. The group started out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording cover songs.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{information}} produced from a successful structural alignment {{is a set}} of residues that are considered equivalent between the structures. This set of equivalences is then typically used to superpose the three-dimensional coordinates for each input structure. (Note that one input element may be fixed as a <b>reference</b> <b>and</b> therefore its superposed coordinates do not change.) The fitted structures can be used to calculate mutual RMSD values, as well as other more sophisticated measures of structural similarity such as the global distance test (GDT, the metric used in CASP). The structural alignment also implies a corresponding one-dimensional sequence alignment from which a sequence identity, or the percentage of residues that are identical between the input structures, can be calculated as a measure of how closely the two sequences are related.|$|E
