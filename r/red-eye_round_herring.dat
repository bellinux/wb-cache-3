40|$|Bibliography: leaves 122 - 159. Three fish species, anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, sardine Sardinops sagax and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> Etrumeus whiteheadi, co-exist {{over the}} western Agulhas Bank (W AB) in the {{southern}} Benguela upwelling ecosystem. To date, data on high-resolution distributions in ichthyoplankton {{in the region is}} lacking. To address this need, coarse and high-resolution ichthyoplankton data were collected using a California vertical egg tow (CalVET) net and a continuous, underway fish egg sampler (CUFES) for horizontal data, respectively, and plankton pump and a closing WP II net for vertical data. Simultaneous measurements of temperature were recorded during the CalVET net hauls. Eggs from vertically stratified samples were grouped into three categories based on their developmental stage using established protocols. Volumetric estimates of egg density (eggs. m- 3) from on-station CUFES samples were significantly correlated with normalized areal (eggs. m- 2) estimates of egg density from CalVET net samples at these stations for sardine (r 0. 91), <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> (r= 0. 80) and anchovy (r = 0. 73), demonstrating the validity of the CUFES sampling technique. Underway sample collection reduced the survey coefficient of variation for sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> eggs but not for anchovy eggs. Horizontal egg distribution patterns for anchovy showed that high egg densities were centered at two specific regions: midshelf (east of Cape Point) and offshore {{in the southern}} region of the study area, whereas those of sardines and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> were more continuously distributed above and beyond the 200 m isobath. Egg abundances for all species generally increased from inshore towards offshore. The mean egg densities for all three species were found to be spatially associated, whereas the station by station distribution patterns of anchovy eggs were spatially distinct from sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring.</b> Eggs of all three species were concentrated near the surface (0 - 20 m), although proportions varied among species. All developmental stages of anchovy egg were confined close to the surface indicating that this species spawns near the surface. Sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> vertical egg profiles varied ontogenetically, even though all developmental stages were concentrated near the surface. A significant (> 50 %) proportion of early egg stages were widely distributed between 0 - 60 and 0 - 80 m for sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring,</b> respectively. These results therefore show that the spawning depths of these three c 1 upeiforms overlap to a large extent, but the intensity of spawning varied at depth for each species. In general the vertical thermal structure seemed to affect only how deeply the eggs are distributed rather than the mean egg abundance. The differences in vertical egg profiles among and within (with respect to ontogenetic variation) species were found to be statistically significant (Chi-squared test, P < 0. 05). Investigations of spawning patterns in relation to temperature, longitude and latitude were used to compare the spawning habitats of the three species. Quotient rule analysis was used to distinguish the preferred temperature ranges of all three species. <b>Round</b> <b>herring</b> spawn over a wider temperature range (16. 5 - 18. 1 °C) than anchovy (17. 4 - 17. 8 ° C and sardine (17 - 18. 1 °C). Two spawning peaks were apparent for <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> (main peak at 17. 2 °C and secondary peak at 17. 8 °C), whereas only one peak at 18. 0 °C was apparent for anchovy and sardine. Anchovy spawning showed a domed-shape relationship with geographic location and the relationship was viewed to be more informative (r 2 = 0. 13 longitude, ~ = 0. 11 latitude) compared to sardine (r 2 = 0. 08 longitude, r 2 = 0. 07 latitude) and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> (r 2 = 0. 04 longitude, r 2 = 0. 06 latitude). These results indicate that anchovy were more specific in their selection of spawning habitat than sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring.</b> Generally, these results suggest that the overall spawning habitats of anchovy, sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> on the W AB overlap to a large extent, but their exact locations of the point of spawning are spatially distinct...|$|R

40|$|Fishes of the {{subfamily}} Dussumieriinae, {{also known}} as <b>round</b> <b>herrings,</b> are a small subgroup of the family Clupeidae inhabiting tropical and subtropical marine coastal waters. A new genus and species of <b>round</b> <b>herring,</b> Trollichthys bol-censis gen. et sp. nov., is described from the lower Eocene micritic limestone of Monte Bolca, northern Italy. This new clupeid taxon is based on seven partially complete articulated skeletons that exhibit a unique combination of features, including: two supramaxillae, edentulous jaw and palate bones, 41 – 42 preural vertebrae and 22 – 24 pleural ribs, pleural ribs-preural vertebrae ratio ranging 0. 52 – 0. 57, five or six supraneural bones, dorsal-fin origin located at about mid-length of the body, dorsal fin with about 16 rays, two postcleithra, pelvic-fin insertion slightly behind the dorsal-fin origin, and pelvic fin with eight rays. Trollichthys bolcensis shares several features with the extant <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> genus Spratelloi-des. However, because of its unique combination of features, Trollichthys bolcensis cannot be confidently assigned {{to any of the}} extant dussumieriine lineages and present evidence does not favour any particular sister-group relationship...|$|R

40|$|An initial {{assessment}} of the South African Round Herring (Etrumeus whiteheadi) resource, {{commonly referred to as}} Red Eye, has been undertaken. Considering the proportion of females in different reproductive stages, Roel and Melo (1990) report that, although older <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> appear to be reproductively active throughout the year, the smaller, more abundant fish are reproductively active for just a short period in the winter, with a peak in June. Their histological analysis indicated peak spawning in May, July, August and November, with no data available for April, June, September or October. The abundance of <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> eggs and larvae per station from the CELP program (August 1977 - August 1978) indicates a very low level of spawning between January and April, with a peak in egg numbers in August and a peak in larvae in October (van der Westhuizen pers. comm.). Taking this into consideration, together with the timing of the recruit survey, the <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> will be modelled to have an annual birth date of 1 June. The model predicted (just turned) 1 year olds on 1 June will therefore be assumed to correspond with the May survey estimates of recruitment...|$|R

40|$|Molecular genetic {{surveys of}} marine fishes have {{revealed}} that some widely distributed species are actually a composite of multiple evolutionary lineages. This is apparent in the <b>round</b> <b>herrings</b> (genus Etrumeus), wherein a globally distributed taxon (Etrumeus sadina Mitchill 1814) has proven to contain at least seven valid taxa, with more likely awaiting discovery. Here, we survey evolutionary lineages of the nominal E. sadina (formerly E. teres, a junior synonym) across the southern temperate zone of Australia, a marine region divided into three biogeographic provinces based primarily {{on the distribution of}} intertidal faunas. Results from morphological and mitochondrial DNA data reveal two evolutionary lineages corresponding to eastern and southwestern provinces (d = 0. 007 for cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and d = 0. 017 for cytochrome b), possibly initiated by the Bassian Isthmus between Australia and Tasmania during low sea-level stands. The Australian <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> is also genetically distinct from the nearest congeneric forms in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, with a corresponding modal difference in gill-raker counts in most cases. Based on these data, we resurrect the title Etrumeus jacksoniensis for the Australian <b>round</b> <b>herring.</b> While the Bassian Isthmus may have initiated the partition of evolutionary lineages within Australia, additional oceanographic and ecological factors must reinforce this separation in order to maintain diagnostic genetic differences along a continuous temperate coastline. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe present work {{studies the}} food and feeding habits of lessepsian fish, Etrumeus teres (Dekay, 1842) to know its feeding {{behavior}} in relation to sex, length and season {{as well as its}} preference for food items. Fish samples were collected monthly from Alexandria landing centers during 2008 and a total of 490 individuals were selected to be examined for this study. The results indicated that <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> E. teres feeds on a variety of food materials mainly small crustaceans (shrimp larvae, isopods and amphipods) followed by fish larvae (Engraulidae, Mugilidae and Labridae); Mollusk (few gastropods and cephalopods) as well as food remains. The feeding intensity showed the highest values during winter and spring (82 % and 50. 55 %, respectively) while the lowest values were during summer and autumn (40. 14 % and 38. 1 %, respectively). <b>Round</b> <b>herring</b> E. teres shifted their fullness index as they grow in length where the lowest value of this index was recorded for a length group of 9 – 15 cm TL and the highest value was recorded for a length group of 15 – 20 cm TL. According to the modified food index (MFI), crustaceans were the first preferable food item represented mainly by shrimp larvae (61. 69 %) followed by fish larvae which were represented mainly by Engraulids (23. 58 %). Diversity index (H′) of food items for males was higher than females; while this index (H′) for the small length group (9 – 15 cm) was higher than the other length groups which suggest that fishes of smaller length seemed to be more active in capturing different food items. Also, the value of diversity index (H′) of Autumn was higher than other seasons. The overlap test (T) showed no obvious differences between males and females and between different length groups where the value was found to be “ 1 ” indicating that all fishes have the same mode of feeding. Food items were attracted and aggregated by artificial light of purse-seine using light giving a positive effect of this fishing method for pelagic fishes particularly E. teres to feed on those materials. From the previous findings, it can be speculated that, <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> E. teres from the Egyptian Mediterranean Waters is zooplanktivorous...|$|R
