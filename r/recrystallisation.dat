5|$|During the {{production}} of incandescent filaments, <b>recrystallisation</b> of tungsten is signifiantly lowered by adding small amounts of thorium dioxide to the tungsten sintering powder before drawing the filaments. A small addition of thorium to tungsten thermocathodes considerably reduced the work function of electrons; as the result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. Tungsten forms a one-atom-thick layer {{on the surface of}} thorium. The work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between thorium and tungsten formed due to thorium's greater electropositivity. Since the 1920s, thoriated tungsten wires have been used in electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of X-ray tubes and rectifiers. Thanks to the reactivity of thorium with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, thorium also marks impurities in the evacuated tubes. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, but not entirely. Thorium dioxide is used in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability. Thorium oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides, such as those of zirconium, cerium, and lanthanum.|$|E

5|$|Alkaline {{digestion}} {{is carried}} out in 30–45% sodium hydroxide solution at about 140°C for about three hours. Too high a temperature leads {{to the formation of}} poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the filtrate, and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction. These reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite sand with a particle size under 45μm. Following filtration, the filter cake includes thorium and the rare earths as their hydroxides, uranium as sodium diuranate, and phosphate as trisodium phosphate. This crystallises trisodium phosphate decahydrate when cooled below 60°C; uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of silicon dioxide in the reaction mixture, necessitating <b>recrystallisation</b> before commercial use. The hydroxides are then dissolved at 80°C in 37% hydrochloric acid. Filtration of the remaining precipitates followed by addition of 47% sodium hydroxide results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about pH 5.8. Complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided, as then air may oxidise cerium from the +3 to the +4 oxidation state, and the cerium(IV) formed can then liberate free chlorine from the hydrochloric acid. The rare earths again precipitate out at higher pH. The precipitates are then neutralised by the original sodium hydroxide solution, although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare-earth phosphates. Solvent extraction may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium, by dissolving the resultant filter cake in nitric acid. The presence of titanium hydroxide is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully.|$|E
500|$|Stable carbenes {{are very}} reactive, {{and so the}} minimum amount of {{handling}} is desirable using air-free techniques. However, provided rigorously dry, relatively non-acidic and air-free materials are used, stable carbenes are reasonably robust to handling per se. By way of example, a stable carbene prepared from potassium hydride can be filtered through a dry celite pad to remove excess KH (and resulting salts) from the reaction. On a relatively small scale, a suspension containing a stable carbene in solution can be allowed to settle and the supernatant solution pushed through a dried membrane syringe filter. Stable carbenes are readily soluble in non-polar solvents such as hexane, and so typically <b>recrystallisation</b> of stable carbenes can be difficult, due to the unavailability of suitable non-acidic polar solvents.

Structural analysis reveals that it is emplaced in an overall north­south spreading direction and that extensional tectonics went on during a significant period of hydrothermal activity. Preliminary results of the Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) study show several magnetic fabrics, mostly carried by magnetite and maghemite, with typical oblate shapes in the sills and oblate to predominantly prolate shapes in the dykes. Most of the intrusions show superimposed magnetic fabrics in the same sampling zones. Some fabrics support interpretations in terms of magma flow, but objectively, different origins for other fabrics, especially for the superimposed ones, cannot be discarded at this stage. Some magnetic fabrics are consistent with those expected in the tectonic deformation field recorded up to the late hydrothermal event.

5|$|For {{several years}} in the 1950s and 1960s, a {{by-product}} of the potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium while the rest was potassium and {{a small fraction of}} caesium. Today the largest producers of caesium, for example the Tanco Mine in Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as by-product from pollucite. Today, a common method for separating rubidium from potassium and caesium is the fractional crystallisation of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O, which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately 30 <b>recrystallisations.</b> The limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limit the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. Caesium, however, is not produced from the above reaction. Instead, the mining of pollucite ore is the main method of obtaining pure caesium, extracted from the ore mainly by three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction. Both metals are produced as by-products of lithium production: after 1958, when interest in lithium's thermonuclear properties increased sharply, the production of rubidium and caesium also increased correspondingly. Pure rubidium and caesium metals are produced by reducing their chlorides with calcium metal at 750°C and low pressure.|$|R
40|$|Solubilities in aqueous {{media of}} sparingly-soluble metal carbonates play an {{important}} role in chemical processes whether they occur in a laboratory, on an industrial scale, or in the geologic environment. Solubility phenomena (i. e. dissolution and precipitation reactions) of metal carbonates control procedures for preparing, separating and purifying chemicals. Moreover, the interactions of the hydrological cycle with the cycle of carbonate rocks, the naturally occurring dissolution of carbonate minerals in water as well as their precipitation on the ocean floor and in the sediments of rivers and lakes can be described by the principles of solubility, although gigantic quantities of material may be involved. The experimental methods for the determination of carbonate solubilities are reviewed and the results are discussed within the frame-work of equilibrium thermodynamics. It will be shown that Gibbs functions of pure stoichiometric carbonate phases can be determined by accurately measuring solubilities in aqueous electrolyte systems. In cases where solid-solid phase transformations and <b>recrystallisations</b> are kinetically inhibited, the methods developed were successfully applied to metastable equilibria. Occasionally, solubility data were even employed to estimate activity coefficients of components forming a series of carbonate solid solutions. Whenever possible the activity coefficients of the reacting species were controlled by use of a constant ionic medium. Solubility constants obtained at various fixed ionic strengths were fitted to the Pitzer equations and extrapolated to infinite dilution. Provided the standard potentials of the respective metal ion/metal electrode are known over a range of ionic strengths the values of solubility constants at infinite dilution can be calculated independently. In any case the optimised thermodynamic constants were incorporated in a comprehensive computer model which permits a wide variety of solubility calculations. These are illustrated by a case study of a multicomponent system with industrial relevance...|$|R
2500|$|The uranium-thorium date {{published}} by Gifford and Ball {{is regarded as}} an invalid and meaningless date for two reasons. First, the sample being partially recrystallised means that this limestone was not a closed system as required for a meaningful uranium-thorium date. As a result, this specific date is only an apparent date that completely lacks any scientific value for interpreting the age of marine limestone underlying the Bimini Road. Currently, specific species of corals and mollusks that can be demonstrated to lack any <b>recrystallisation</b> using petrographic and X-ray diffraction techniques are the preferred samples for dating. Any limestone sample that shows {{the least amount of}} <b>recrystallisation</b> is now regarded as incapable of yielding a scientifically valid date and not even worth an attempt at dating. Finally, it is well documented that about 15,000 calendar years ago, sea level in this region was between [...] below present sea level. As a result, the location from where Gifford and Ball collected the sample of limestone was between [...] (295 and 312 feet) above sea level at the time indicated by the uranium-thorium date of 14,992±258 BP (7132-19/2). Therefore, it is physically impossible for the marine limestone underlying the Bimini Road to have accumulated around 15,000 BP. Thus, this uranium-thorium date is a meaningless, invalid date lacking any scientific significance. Because this date clearly lacks any scientific meaning, geologists and archaeologists rarely mention it in their discussions of the Bimini Road. The marine limestone underlying the Bimini Road dates to the Sangamonian Stage, the last interglacial, when sea level was last high enough for the marine sediments, now lithified into limestone, to have accumulated.|$|E

40|$|Bacterial mats called biofilms {{that form}} on the {{surfaces}} of industrial steel pipes can cause corrosion of the pipe. Examining the steel surface of the corroded pipe usually involves removal of the biofilm using acid. This acid can also cause corrosion of the pipe so that the observed corrosion cracks and pits {{are the result of}} both the acid and the biofilm. It was thought that non-invasive examination of the corrosion caused by the biofilm may be obtained by using a thin wire bent into a loop that acts as both a heat source a nd a detector of heat, measuring the changes in heat flow out of the wire as the wire passes over the steel with the biofilm still present. This technique of using a heated probe to scan samples on a microscopic scale is called Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) and uses an alternating current to produce a. c. thermal waves that emanate from the probe tip into the sample. The alternating current allows better signal-to-noise ratios and also selective depth imaging of the sample since the thermal wave penetrates into the sample a distance inversely proportional to the applied current frequency. Reversal in the contrast of SThM images on biofilms and subsequently all samples was observed as either the frequency or the amplitude of the temperature waves was altered. Whilst changing the time constant of the feedback circuit attached to the SThM probe did go some way to explain this effect, a full explanation is still wanting. Despite many efforts to image the biofilm/steel interface with the biofilm still present, often the biofilm was either too thick or too complicated to do this. A simpler thermal test sample is required to calibrate the thermal probe. In addition to SThM, one may select a point on a sample surface and ramp the temperature of the probe to obtain a Localised Thermal Analysis (LTA) temperature scan looking for melts, <b>recrystallisations,</b> glass transitions of the part of the sample in contact with the probe. This technique is a miniaturised version of Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry where two pans are used, one containing the sample and one containing air as a reference. In LTA, a second probe is used in air near to the sample as a reference and the difference between the voltages across the two probes is recorded, this difference being related to the thermal properties of the sample. LTA has been carried out on poly(ethylene terephthalate), bismuth, indium, and solder, with bismuth showing a sharp melting point. An attempt to understand the effect of the sample material on the heat flow out of the probe in SThM was made by constructing a simple two-layer semi-infinite planar mathematical model of the probe/air gap/sample setup used in SThM. The model showed that for large air gaps the effect of changing the sample was minimal, whereas for small air gaps considerable variation in the heat flow was observed that strongly depended on the thermal conductivity of the sample and the frequency of the applied current through the probe. A series of experiments were then carried out to verify the results of the model and the results agreed to within 50 % despite the oversimplified nature of the model, due to the highly diffusive nature of the thermal waves.

40|$|National audienceIntroduction This paper {{propose the}} {{application}} of A. J. Stutz method of diagenetic cementum modification identification to the skeletochronological analysis of Level 4 of the Pech-de-l'Azé I study previously published by some of us (Armand et al., 2001). Skeletochronology {{is based on the}} observation of seasonal cementum deposits and has long been used in zooarchaeology to access the season of death of human preys (Saxon and Higham, 1968; Spiess, 1979; Burke, 1995; Martin, 1994; Pike-Tay et al., 1999). Cementum is a bonelike tissue that allows the connection between tooth roots and the gingival, through the periodontal ligament, (Lieberman and Meadow, 1992; Klevezal', 1996; Dieckwisch, 2001). It apposes itself along mammal tooth roots from their formation, until the death of the animal. In most mammal populations, this growth follows predictable seasonal cycles which exhibit the succession of a fast growth deposit (also called "Zone") from mid-spring to autumn and a slow growth one (Annulus and/or LAG) in winter (Klevezal' and Kleinenberg, 1969; Martin, 1994; Burke and Castanet, 1995; Klevezal', 1996; Moffit, 1998; Peck, 2004). Seasonal patterns of cementum depositions produce microscopically distinct incremental levels, which may exhibit one or more of a variety of ultrastructural, microstructural, and histological patterns (Figure 1). Taphonomy and cementum Although lots of researchers have underlined the existence of post-mortem modification of the tooth tissues (Figure 2), few of them specifically focalised on the taphonomic modifications that can alter the seasonal record such as weathering (Figure 2). One of {{the most important of these}} taphonomic processes is the apatite crystal re-crystallisation that can mimic biogenic deposit that cannot be identified with the classical methods used (Stutz, 2002 a, 2002 b). However, in polarizing microscopy (Gilbert, 1989), the use of the Lambda plate can help to resolve this issue by colouring the taphonomic and the biogenic deposit in two different ways (figure 3). Figure 4 proposes an example of the lambda plate application for the identification of diagenesis modifications. We present {{the application of}} this method to the skeletochronological study of Pech-de-l'Azé I level 4 originally conducted by some of us (Armand et al, 2001). Our objectives was firstly to propose a revaluation of the previous seasonal results and, secondly, to present an example of the impact of that kind of modifications on archaeological series. Revision of the Pech-de-l'Azé I The previous skeletochronological study of Pech-de-l'Azé I was conducted on the two main taxa identified in the level 4 : the red deer and the bison. It highlighted the well preservation of the cementum increment (Armand et al., 2001) and proposed a deer slaughter during the good season and a bison hunt during the bad season (fig. 5). The revaluation has concerned the same material and the observations were made with the lambda plate inserted. Twelve teeth were analysed and taphonomic modification were identified on several of them (tab. 1). It appears that five of the twelve teeth exhibited some apatite <b>recrystallisations</b> and/or a lost of their collagen structure that conducted to the lost of a part of the seasonal records. For these teeth, the post-mortem modifications were too important to propose a precise age at death. In addition, in three cases, we weren't able to establish the season of death (fig. 6). Moreover a black deposit on the outer-edge of the cementum was identified. It appears that it was previously interpreted as a slow growth deposit. The use of the lambda plate has helped us to recognize it as a non biogenic material and, consequently, to correct the previous identification. Discussion By tacking into account the post-mortem modification, we were able to propose a modified seasonal spectrum of the Pech-de-l'Azé I fauna, in which four seasonal result were different from the prior study (fig. 7). The red deer hunting season wasn't really modified contrary to the bison one. At the end of this study, it appears that the bisons were killed at the end of the good season contrary to what was previously proposed. These new data modify the perception we had of the subsistence strategies by rejecting the hypothesis of a bison hunt during the winter. A second sampling in the same level (not presented here) has confirmed the results of this study (Rendu, 2007). The conclusions of this paper underline, that although most of the skeletochronological samples are not affected by these kinds of alterations, they appears to be quite common. They may have important consequences on the skeletochronological results, especially for the small samples. However, while taphonomic modifications of the cementum records might interfere with the seasonal interpretations, it is now possible to resolve these problems. Consequently, the technique developed by A. J. Stutz (2002 a, 2002 b) helps to magnify the reliability of one of the most accurate method to discuss the season of death of ungulate preys. Alors que la cémentochronologie est une méthode de plus en plus utilisée pour reconstituer la saisonnalité de prédation des animaux présents en contexte archéologique, peu d'études incluent la recherche systématique des modifications taphonomiques qui peuvent affecter le cément. Ce travail propose une présentation des phénomènes de remobilisations diagénétiques de l'enregistrement saisonnier. À travers la reprise de l'analyse du niveau 4 du gisement du Pech-de-l'Azé I, nous proposons une illustration de leurs conséquences sur les études cémentochronologiques...|$|R
