5|$|As the show's revenue {{continued}} to rise through syndication and DVD sales, the main cast stopped appearing for script <b>readings</b> <b>in</b> April 2004. The work stoppage occurred after weeks of unsuccessful negotiations with Fox, in which the cast asked {{for an increase in}} their pay to $360,000 per episode, or $8 million over a 22-episode season. The strike was resolved a month later and their salary was raised to something between $250,000 and $360,000 per episode.|$|E

5|$|The tarot {{readings}} of fortunetellers Sofie {{and her mother}} Apollonia advance the plot significantly. Sofie's <b>readings</b> <b>in</b> the pilot episode induce visions in Ben that give insight into his healing powers of his childhood.

Another of her readings sets Ben on a journey to Scudder, the man he has been looking for {{since the beginning of}} the series.|$|E
5|$|According to Kurt Aland it {{agrees with}} the Byzantine text-type 87 times in the Gospels, 13 times in the Acts, 29 times in Paul, and 16 times in the Catholic epistles. It {{agrees with the}} Nestle-Aland text 66 times (Gospels), 38 (Acts), 104 (Paul), and 41 (Cath.). It has 50 {{independent}} or distinctive <b>readings</b> <b>in</b> the Gospels, 11 in Acts, 17 in Paul, and 14 in the Catholic epistles. Aland placed {{the text of the}} codex in Category II. According to the Claremont Profile Method its text is mixed in Luke 1, Luke 10, and Luke 20.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} shows that Zhou dynasty divination was grounded in cleromancy, the production of seemingly random numbers to determine divine intent. The Zhou yi provided a guide to cleromancy that used the stalks of the yarrow plant, {{but it is not}} known how the yarrow stalks became numbers, or how specific lines were chosen from the line <b>readings.</b> <b>In</b> the hexagrams, broken lines were used as shorthand for the numbers 6 (六) and 8 (八), and solid lines were shorthand for values of 7 (七) and 9 (九). The Great Commentary contains a late classic description of a process where various numerological operations are performed on a bundle of 50 stalks, leaving remainders of 6 to 9. Like the Zhou yi itself, yarrow stalk divination dates to the Western Zhou period, although its modern form is a reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|Detractors further {{blamed the}} school for the accident, saying that, {{in the name of}} tradition, administrators {{turned a blind eye to}} an unsafe {{structure}} being constructed with minimal engineering and safety protocols. Before the collapse, some people expressed concerns about the safety of the Bonfire, citing the partial collapse that occurred in a previous Bonfire, the progressively shorter Bonfire burn times (collapse of the stack after lighting) which had dropped from several hours to less than 20minutes, and numerous incidents involving alcohol or unsafe horseplay at the Bonfire site. One of the students killed in the 1999 Bonfire collapse was under the legal drinking age yet a toxicology test showed high blood-alcohol levels; however, lower <b>readings</b> <b>in</b> a second test and inconsistencies in the initial sampling and annotation methods led to questions about the accuracy of the original tests.|$|E
5|$|In Aland's Profile, Kurt and Barbara Aland {{placed the}} codex's Gospels in Category III, meaning it has {{historical}} importance, with {{the profile of}} 1191, 802, 601/2, 69s. This means {{the text of the}} codex agrees with the Byzantine standard text 119 times, with the original text against the Byzantine 80 times, and with both the Byzantine and original text 60 times. There are 69 independent or distinctive <b>readings</b> <b>in</b> the Gospels. While the Gospels are a representative of the Caesarean text-type, the remainder of the books of the New Testament in this codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type and falls into Category V, the lowest and least important in Aland's Profile.|$|E

5|$|Without {{a steady}} income, his {{financial}} situation began to deteriorate. He began submitting his poems to more prominent literary magazines, including Scribner's Monthly, but {{was informed that}} although he showed promise, his work was still short of the standards required for use in their publications. Locally, he was still dealing with the stigma of the Poe plot. The Indianapolis Journal and other newspapers refused to accept his poetry, leaving Riley desperate for income. In January 1878 {{on the advice of}} a friend, Riley paid an entrance fee to join a traveling lecture circuit where he could give poetry <b>readings.</b> <b>In</b> exchange, he received a portion of the profit his performances earned. Such circuits were popular at the time, and Riley quickly earned a local reputation for his entertaining readings.|$|E
5|$|In two years, a {{very precise}} map, drawn on six sheets at a 1/200,000 scale, was produced. In March 1829, {{a base of}} 3,500 meters had been traced in the Argolis, from one angle at the ruins of Tiryns to an angle of a house in ruins {{in the village of}} Aria. This was {{intended}} to serve as a point of departure in all the triangulation operations for topographic and geodesic <b>readings</b> <b>in</b> the Peloponnese. Pierre Peytier and Puillon-Boblaye proceeded to perform numerous verifications on the base and on the rulers used. The margin of error was thus reduced to 1 meter for every 15 kilometers. The longitude and latitude of the base point at Tiryns were read and checked, so that again the margin of error was reduced as far as possible to an estimated 0.2 seconds. 134 geodesic stations were set up on the peninsula’s mountains, as well as on Aegina, Hydra and Nafplion. Thus, equilateral triangles whose sides measured about 20km were drawn. The angles were measured with theodolites by Gambey.|$|E
5|$|Unusual in many aspects, the 1846Havana {{hurricane}} was {{the most}} intense of its time. Though atmospheric pressure <b>readings</b> <b>in</b> Cuba reached as low as 916mbar (27.06inHg), the meteorological historian Jose Fernandez-Partagás re-evaluated several possible pressure records, concluding that the cyclone's minimum pressure was likely closer to 938mbar (27.70inHg); even so, it maintained the title of having the lowest recorded pressure measurement until 1924, 78years later. Although no reliable wind measurements were available at the time, a separate study also estimated that it produced Category5-strength winds, making it the first known storm to strike Cuba at such an intensity. As {{a result of the}} tropical cyclone's extreme intensity, ecological and geographical features were permanently altered in many areas. Sand Key, which completely submerged {{during the course of the}} hurricane, wholly re-emerged by December of that year, albeit not in its original position; meanwhile, ecological damage remained evident for decades in Key West.|$|E
