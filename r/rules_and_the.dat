5|$|Aston Villa Football Club {{were formed}} in March 1874, {{by members of}} the Villa Cross Wesleyan Chapel in Handsworth which is now part of Birmingham. The four founders of Aston Villa were Jack Hughes, Frederick Matthews, Walter Price and William Scattergood. Aston Villa's first match was against the local Aston Brook St Mary's Rugby team. As a {{condition}} of the match, the Villa side had to agree to play the first half under Rugby <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second half under Association rules. After moving to the Wellington Road ground in 1876, Villa soon established themselves {{as one of the best}} teams in the Midlands, winning their first honour, the Birmingham Senior Cup in 1880, under the captaincy of Scotsman George Ramsay.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati is {{a manifestation}} of the anti-social and inauspicious {{elements}} in women and is an antithesis to the goddess Lakshmi. Like Alakshmi, Dhumavati rules over the four months of the rainy season, when even solar light is obscured by the evil water spirit. This coincides with Chaturmas, a period during the year when the god Vishnu sleeps. At that time, darkness <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> soul loses its usual luster. This period is considered inauspicious, and as such as no auspicious ceremonies like marriage can take place.|$|E
5|$|On September 14, 2014, West ejected Jonathan Papelbon for the lewd act of {{adjusting}} his groin, {{resulting in}} a confrontation where West grabbed Papelbon's jersey. MLB subsequently suspended Papelbon for seven games for his lewd act and West for one game for initiating contact with Papelbon, marking the first umpire suspension since Fieldin Culbreth's May 2013 suspension for misapplication of baseball <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first on-field misconduct suspension of an umpire since Bob Davidson's May 2012 suspension for situation handling violations related to his ejection of Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel. West later claimed Papelbon had initiated first contact, but Major League Baseball determined that the video replay showed West was not correct, and that the contact was initiated by West.|$|E

5|$|This {{is a list}} {{of seasons}} played by Aston Villa Football Club in English and European football, from 1879 (the year of the club's first FA Cup entry) to the most recent {{completed}} season. Aston Villa football club was founded in March, 1874, by members of the Villa Cross Wesleyan Chapel in Aston. Throughout the 1870s Aston Villa played a small amount of games. At least one game, against Aston Brook St Mary's was played with one half under Rugby <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other under football rules. In the 1880s the game became more formalised and in 1888, William McGregor formed the Football League with 11 other clubs.|$|E
5|$|Ending {{his playing}} career, Bauer became coach, {{general manager and}} {{president}} of the Dutchmen in 1952. He coached the team to two OHA senior championships and Allan Cup victories: 1952–53 and 1954–55. As the top senior team in the nation, the Dutchmen were sent to Italy to represent Canada at the 1956 Winter Olympics. Bauer was pleased with the way his team adapted to European <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dutchmen were expected to bring home the gold medal. However, the team was shocked by the American entry, a 4–1 loss. Though they still had a chance at gold due to the round robin format of the tournament, the Dutchmen were defeated by the Soviet Union – at the time a relatively unknown and emerging hockey power – by a 2–0 score despite outshooting the Soviets 23–9. Canada was relegated to the bronze medal, at the time the worst finish in the nation's Olympic hockey history.|$|E
5|$|In {{physical}} systems, Noether's theorem {{provides an}} equivalence between conservation laws and symmetries of the system. However, for cellular automata this theorem {{does not directly}} apply, because instead of being governed by {{the energy of the}} system the behavior of the automaton is encoded into its <b>rules,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> automaton is guaranteed to obey certain symmetries (translation invariance in both space and time) regardless of any conservation laws it might obey. Nevertheless, the conserved quantities of certain reversible systems behave similarly to energy in some respects. For instance, if different regions of the automaton have different average values of some conserved quantity, the automaton's rules may cause this quantity to dissipate, so that the distribution of the quantity is more uniform in later states. Using these conserved quantities as a stand-in for the energy of the system can allow it to be analyzed using methods from classical physics.|$|E

5|$|The main rivalry {{heading into}} New Year's Revolution was between John Cena and Umaga over the WWE Championship. The rivalry all {{began on the}} November 6 episode of Raw, one of WWE's main {{television}} programs, when Cena interfered in Umaga's match while accepting a challenge to a match by Kevin Federline. One week later, Jonathan Coachman, an on-screen authority figure of Raw, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, announced that a match between Cena and Umaga would take place, which ended in a no-contest due to interference. Three weeks later on the November 27 edition of Raw, Umaga (through Armando Alejandro Estrada) issued a challenge to Cena for the WWE Championship, which Cena accepted. The following week, Cena was assaulted by Umaga after his match, and both were confronted by security. Afterwards, neither of them could touch each other outside of a match until New Year's Revolution. On the December 18 edition of Raw, Cena, along with D-Generation X, (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) faced off against Umaga and Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton). The match ended in a no-contest after Cena and Umaga started brawling to the backstage area. Two weeks later on the January 1 edition of Raw, Cena faced off against Federline in a No Disqualification match, a match {{where there is no}} <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> only way to win is by pinfall or submission. During the match, Umaga came to the ring and hit Cena with the WWE championship belt, which allowed Federline to pin Cena for the win. This led to a 4-on-1 handicap match later that night between Johnny Nitro, Johnathan Coachman, Umaga, and Estrada and Cena, where Cena attacked Umaga with a folding chair, causing the disqualification.|$|E
