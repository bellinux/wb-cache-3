Research shows that policing interventions that target criminogenic places, people and times are effective for controlling crime and disorder problems. For example, we know that directed police patrols controls crime and disorder at hotspots (see Braga et al., 2012 for a review); mandatory arrest reduces recidivism for some domestic violence offenders (Ariel & Sherman, 2012; Maxwell, Garner, & Fagan, 2002); and crackdowns followed by target hardening interupts the temporal clustering of <b>repeat</b> burglary <b>victimisation</b> (e. g., Forrester Chatterton, & Pease, 1988; Farrell et al., 1998) [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Professor Ken Pease, former {{acting head}} of the Home Office's police {{research}} group, and Professor Graham Farrell of Loughborough University, estimated in 2007 that the survey was underreporting crime by about 3 million incidents per year due to its practice of arbitrarily capping the number of crimes one can be victimised by {{in a given year}} at five. [...] If true the error means that violent crime might actually stand at 4.4 million incidents per year, an 82% increase over the 2.4 million previously thought. Since the five crimes per person cap has been consistent since the BCS began this might not affect the long-term trends, however it takes little account of crimes such as domestic violence, figures for which would allegedly be 140% higher without the cap. [...] The ONS has responded by explaining that because victims of ongoing abuse often are unable to recall the detail and number of specific incidents it makes sense to record this crime as a series of <b>repeat</b> <b>victimisation.</b> These are only recorded in this manner if the incidents described were ‘the same thing, done under the same circumstances and probably by the same people’. Because the number of victims captured by the survey that experience high levels of <b>repeat</b> <b>victimisation</b> are relatively low, spurious volatility in the data will occur from year to year. However, the ONS has admitted that the cap of 5 incidents is crude and will be publishing a review.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{reports and}} {{analyses}} rates and correlates of <b>repeat</b> <b>victimisation</b> in selected European cities. Rates of repeat were lower outside the English cities surveyed. However, the extreme level of <b>repeat</b> <b>victimisation</b> among dacha victims in Miskolc, Hungary, proved startling, indicating {{the vulnerability of}} such property to burglary. There are marked differences between levels of <b>repeat</b> <b>victimisation</b> in different cities and countries. In both East and West Europe, repeat victims {{are more likely than}} first-timers to leave the home unoccupied in the daytime for at least six hours. There was no convincing evidence that repeats {{were more likely to be}} affected by the burglary at the time it occurred. In essence, it seems likely that the "shock of the new " more than compensates for the "last straw. " In this context, it is perhaps surprising that first-timers were more likely to feel they had no need for victim assistance. A different pattern emerges, however, when the longer-term implications of <b>repeat</b> <b>victimisation</b> are considered. "Repeats" were less positive about their neighbours and neighbourhood and more inclined to express a desire to move, and were more likely to register fear, related to both the risk of a future burglary and street offences. This suggests that both crime prevention and community safety initiatives are correctly targeted at repeat victims.

40|$|M. Cur. South Africa {{is called}} the Rainbow Nation {{with a variety of}} {{cultures}} and ethnic groups. The population currently is estimated at over 40 million, of whom 73 % are women and children (Government Gazette, 1997 : 11). According to the Government Gazette (1997 : 11) major disparities and inequalities exist between the different population groups, with reference to their socio-economic position. This inevitably led to major problems such as poverty and violence. One of these problems of violence seems to be domestic violence as stated by the South African Police Service (1998 : 10). They confirmed that the number of incidents of domestic violence in which especially women, children and the elderly are the victims, appear to be continually on the increase in South Africa. The South African Police Service (1998 : 1) states that domestic violence is a serious crime against society, which can lead to <b>repeated</b> <b>victimisation</b> and <b>repeated</b> offending and sometimes eventually spirals into fatality. Domestic violence became a topic of interest to the researcher {{because of the number of}} women that came under her attention while working in the community services. Evaluation of the service delivery and understanding of domestic violence by community members and health care workers showed poor results with some still clinging to myths coming from cultural beliefs. According to Hague and Wilson (2000 : 157) the most common explanation for domestic violence continues to be a lack of compliance by the wife, coupled with historically long-lived ideas about the breadwinner's rightful authority. The goal of this study was to explore and describe the lived experience of abused women subjected to domestic violence and to describe guidelines for psychiatric nurse practitioners to support abused women who are subjected to domestic violence, in facilitating their mental health and optimising their ability to terminate the abusive situation. In conducting this research the framework of the Theory for Health Promotion in Nursing (Rand Afrikaans University, 2000) were used, which dealt with the internal and external world experience of the abused women. A qualitative, explorative, descriptive and contextual research design was used specific to domestic violence for this study. In-depth, semi-structured phenomenological interviews were conducted with abused women subjected to domestic violence who met the sample criteria. To ensure trustworthiness, the researcher made use ofGuba's (DeVos, 1998 : 348 - 350) model of trustworthiness. Data analysis was done according to Tesch's (DeVos, 1998 : 343 - 352) method. The results of this study showed that abused women who are subjected to domestic violence suffer a great deal of trauma and degrading due to physical or mental abuse of a loved one. Their trauma was evident by the experience of negative psychological dynamics that contributed to the shattering of the self. The degrading of the person eventually leads to the shattering of other relations and at the end to the realisation that they are victims...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{describes}} {{the impact of}} trauma on the perceptual thinking processes of participants who have sustained <b>repeated</b> criminal <b>victimisation</b> in South Africa. Fifteen adult males, (mean age 40. 73 years) participated voluntarily in this descriptive study. The Rorschach Inkblot Method (RIM) is the psychometric instrument {{used to describe the}} participants and Exner’s Comprehensive System (CS) is the method of interpretation employed. The Perceptual Thinking Index (PTI) is the cluster of variables selected to describe each participant’s level of reality testing and perceptual functioning. Together with this, the D and Adjusted D Score variables are discussed to describe the participants’ overall and current coping capacities. From the research findings yielded in this study, it appears that the majority of these participants (73 %) can be described as experiencing problems in terms of their perceptual thinking processes. They are also unable to appropriately engage in accurate reality testing. The results of the research study may serve as an incentive for further studies of this nature as according to the RIM, participants with this level of impaired reality testing generally present with psychotic features. However, these research results were found in participants who present with an absence of a psychotic or any schizophrenic type disorder diagnoses. Other researchers who used the RIM to assess trauma victims have found results similar to this. Furthermore, participants who present with this level of impaired reality testing, generally experience severe problems in coping with basic psychological aspects of daily functioning. This however, {{does not appear to be}} the case with this sample group, which was one of the motivating factors for conducting this research. A concluding suggestion is made for possible research into investigating how, and at what expense, other psychological features of functioning are employed, in order to manage in a seemingly well-adaptive manner.

The thesis is framed in the context of evolutionary epistemology, which is the philosophy underpinning both approaches to meta-evaluation addressed herein. The thesis starts, with an examination of: firstly, how the evaluation methods in question have evolved, and the background to their scientific worth; and secondly, how situational crime prevention measures have evolved over time. The thesis then examines the two competing approaches for their contribution to the evaluation ecosystem by using both to assess <b>repeat</b> <b>victimisation</b> prevention interventions. Finally, the last section poses the question of whether it is survival of the fittest, or whether co-existence or adaptation could be the key to survival for these two meta-evaluative methodologies. <b>Repeat</b> <b>victimisation</b> prevention is revealed as an effective way of reducing crime, with a need for further research to apply the principle across further crime types. A requirement is identified for a greater breadth and depth of information to be included in future crime prevention evaluations. The systematic review is shown to be a useful way of assessing the overall effectiveness of the interventions, whilst the realist synthesis fills in the detail of why some interventions work and others fail.

40|$|Preventing {{crime and}} {{preventing}} <b>repeat</b> <b>victimisation</b> are priority {{issues for the}} criminal justice system in 1999. Numerous research studies have shown that a small minority of offenders is responsible for a large proportion of all offences recorded by the police and, further, that a minority of victims experiences the majority of crime. It is well known that crime incidents are not uniformly distributed across geographic areas. Some neighbourhoods experience more violent crimes than others, and understanding this dynamic is valuable in formulating crime prevention and law enforcement strategies. The Australian Institute of Criminology’s Research and Public Policy Series no. 15, <b>Repeat</b> <b>Victimisation</b> in Australia by Satyanshu Mukherjee and Carlos Carcach, showed that over half of all property crimes (e. g. break and enter, attempted break and enter and motor vehicle theft) occurred in just over a quarter of all households. Households that experienced three or more incidents (10 per cent of all victim households) during the year accounted for 25 per cent of all incidents. The same study showed that about two-thirds of personal crimes (assault, sexual assault and robbery) are experienced by 41 per cent of victims. It also made the point that if, as a crime prevention measure, we wish to target 1000 randomly selected unvictimised households, we may on an average prevent 83 household crimes; but if we select 1000 previously victimised households, {{we may be able to}} prevent 286 household crimes.

Repeat robberies follow the success of earlier robberies, with the probability of repetition being roughly predictable from average sum taken (with attempts counting zero) at prior robberies of the same branch. Repeat robberies are less successful than first robberies, presumably because of security en-hancements or staff training following the earlier event(s).

40|$|To date {{there has}} been little Australian {{research}} on <b>repeat</b> <b>victimisation.</b> This is a study of repeat burglary in an area of Brisbane using police calls for service data. We demonstrate: (a) the prevalence of residential repeat victim addresses (‘hot dots’) is of a similar magnitude to that found in studies in the United Kingdom; (b) the time distributions of revictimisation are identical with those found in studies in the UK and elsewhere; (c) ‘hot spots ’ (small areas with high crime density) can be identified by statistical analyses of spatial concentrations of incidents; (d) unstable hot spots tend to be temporary aggregations of hot dots, whereas stable hot spots seem to reflect more the social and physical characteristics of certain localities; and (e) the overall incidence of burglary could be reduced by at least 25 per cent if all <b>repeat</b> <b>victimisation</b> could be eliminated. There are a number of areas where concepts and techniques for repeat victim research could potentially be strengthened: (a) clarifying the connections between hot dots and hot spots, particularly through exploration of the concept of a ‘near repeat address’; (b) applying survival analysis to the data on the time periods between victimisations; and (c) using moving average techniques to examine changes in the spatial distributions of burglary over time. Burglary has been a growing problem, both in Queensland and in Australia as a whole, for the past 20 years, although police statistics and crime victim surveys indicate that the Queensland rate is close to the national average (Criminal Justice Commission, 1996). However, there are indications that the rate may have peaked, with recent marked declines in the burglary rate in Queensland (Queensland Police Service, 1998).

[Male chronic victim] This chapter addresses the emotional loss experienced by chronic victims, whose healing scars are reopened. Chronic victims do not have the luxury of time between successive victimisations for their emotional wounds to be healed. This process involves four different stages that will be discussed in detail shortly (Figure 1). Chronic victims of crime are unable to progress through these phases. Onl...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{initiatives}} {{to encourage the}} reporting of sexual assault to police, women who are sexually victimized by intimate partners are least likely to seek legal redress. This leaves them at risk of <b>repeat</b> <b>victimisation</b> and open to victim blaming. This paper demonstrates that reporting decisions are mediated {{by a number of}} competing personal, cultural and situational demands, which act as barriers to the criminal justice system. At the same time, non-reporting may be viewed as a rational response to victimisation in some circumstances, as it maintains particular values and achieves desired outcomes. This {{is not to suggest that}} women should not be encouraged to report sexual offences, but indicates that victims who do report to police must be enabled to achieve other desired outcomes, such as protection from reprisal. 3 Sexual assault is a largely hidden crime that occurs within private contexts such as relationships and families. As most sex offences are committed by males and victims are predominantly females, ‘family ’ is narrowly defined in this paper in terms o...|$|E
40|$|This report pulls {{together}} {{a number of}} research results {{from a variety of}} sources, much of it carried out with Home Office support. The subject of the report is ‘repeat victimisation’ – the paper describes the extent to which victims or places are repeatedly subject to crime and speculates about the implications for prevention. In relation to some offences the repeated vulnerability of particular individuals is self evident – domestic violence is probably the most obvious example. But in relation to other crimes, such as domestic burglary, attacks on schools or car crime the extent to which repetition occurs is far from obvious but clearly shown in the report. Some of the research had been lying in the academic arena for a long time – but its practical significance for prevention and for policing had not been appreciated. The reduction of <b>repeat</b> <b>victimisation</b> in its several manifestations offers a challenge to the police and their partners in crime prevention. The report is intended to provoke discussion and preventive action across a wide field...|$|E

40|$|These 'Guidelines for Corporations' {{are aimed}} at {{providing}} a practical and specific tool for a better implementation, by corporations and corporate officers (as far as they, too, can be considered an 'intermediate' but very relevant target), of Directive 2012 / 29 /EU, with specific respect to victims of corporate crime and corporate violence. Building on a previous theoretical and empirical research, {{in the framework of}} an international research project on 'Victims and Corporations', this chapter provides a brief overview of the peculiarities and problems related to corporate violence victimization, i. e. to criminal offences committed by corporations {{in the course of their}} legitimate activities, which result in harms to natural persons’ health, integrity or life, and whose victims experience a whole range of distinctive risks of secondary and <b>repeat</b> <b>victimisation,</b> of intimidation and retaliation, as well as of harm to their dignity and private and family life. An overview of the harms and risks suffered by these victims is therefore indispensible in view of a competent and effective individual assessment of their specific protection needs...|$|E
