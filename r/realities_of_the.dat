5|$|Farm {{animals are}} {{widespread}} {{in books and}} songs for children; the reality of animal husbandry is often distorted, softened, or idealized, giving children an almost entirely fictitious account of farm life. The books often depict a rural idyll of happy animals free to roam in attractive countryside, which is completely {{at odds with the}} <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impersonal, mechanized activities involved in modern intensive farming.|$|E
5|$|Unusual weather phenomena, such as {{snow and}} mist, fascinated Monet because they altered the {{chromatic}} appearance of familiar topography. In such paintings as The Magpie, one of Monet's early masterpieces, form dissolves under {{the combination of}} a greatly restricted color range, aerial perspective, and broken brushwork. A virtuoso color performance, the painting is an essay on the variations of white perceptible in the reflection of sun on crisp new snow. Wonderfully abstract passages of flat color, such as the strong violet shades along the fence, are divorced from the spatial <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> objects portrayed.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{economic}} <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conversion to sound, were the artistic considerations. Early sound films were often noted for being too verbose. In 1930, Carl Laemmle criticized the wall-to-wall banter of sound pictures, and director Ernst Lubitsch wondered what the camera was intended for if characters were going to narrate all the onscreen action. The film industry also withstood competition from the home radio, and often characters in films {{went to great lengths}} to belittle the medium. The film industry was not above using the new medium to broadcast commercials for its projects however, and occasionally turned radio stars into short feature performers to take advantage of their built-in following.|$|E

30|$|Images {{produce a}} <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> their own. This {{specific}} reality cannot be grasped by dualistically separating {{it from an}} alleged <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> ‘the factual’. We can clearly see this effect of creating an ‘own’ <b>reality</b> in works <b>of</b> art of abstract modernism displaying something which eludes objective, measurable and countable approaches. What is displayed by these images points to meaning (or emotion) rather than matter. This implicit meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image is perceived as <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image. From an epistemological perspective, <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image and <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factual are incongruent and disparate (Schütz 2016 a, 2016 b). <b>The</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image with its inherent logic and materiality can become tangible precisely in this incongruity. From an epistemological point <b>of</b> view, <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image is not only perceived as reality, but also responded to immediately. <b>The</b> multitude <b>of</b> experiences which are constituted while looking at an image are immediate responses to <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image. <b>The</b> inherent, experiential <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image is grounded in this pre-verbal and implicit meaning.|$|R

5|$|Commercial diving {{operations}} may {{expose the}} diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational {{health and safety}} legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial diving operations are also constrained by the physical <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial diving operation, and this is also the case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{rock and roll}} was faltering as its major stars dropped from public view. Elvis Presley was drafted, Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran died in 1959 and 1960 respectively, Chuck Berry was in jail, and Jerry Lee Lewis had been disgraced by press reports that he married his 13-year-old cousin. Music and culture critic Nelson George disagrees with music historians who attest {{the last two years}} of the 1950s were barren of talent, {{pointing}} to Charles and this song in particular. George writes that the themes in Charles' work were very similar to the young rebels who popularized rock and roll, writing By breaking down the division between pulpit and bandstand, recharging blues concerns with transcendental fervor, unashamedly linking the spiritual and the sexual, Charles made pleasure (physical satisfaction) and joy (divine enlightenment) seem the same thing. By doing so he brought the <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saturday-night sinner and Sunday-morning worshipper—so often one and the same—into raucous harmony.|$|E
5|$|Keable {{eventually}} achieved {{his wish}} {{of going to}} war in 1917, when a South African contingent was mustered for military service in France and Keable volunteered {{to go with them}} as chaplain. His experiences there were to form the basis for his first and most successful novel, Simon Called Peter. Appointed an army chaplain on 26 May 1917, Keable travelled to the Rouen sector with a Native Labour Contingent of 21,000 men. These men were paid £3 per month to unload supply ships and provide infrastructure support for military operations in Europe. As a chaplain, with the rank of captain, Keable was expected to be at the disposal of the army at large, and ministered to those seeing active infantry service as well as to labourers. Padres were formally required to remain behind the lines, but it is apparent that Keable nonetheless saw something of the <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frontline.|$|E

The audience learns salesman Jim Halpert has a crush on receptionist Pam Beesly (who helps him play pranks on co-worker Dwight Schrute), {{even though she is}} engaged to Roy (who works in the building's lower-level warehouse). News spreads throughout the office that Dunder Mifflin's corporate headquarters is planning to downsize an entire branch, leading to general anxiety, but Michael chooses to deny or downplay the <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation in order to maintain employee morale.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1925 {{tensions}} between the Druze chiefs of the Hauran led by Sultan Pasha al-Atrash and the French authorities culminated with the Great Syrian Revolt, which spread throughout Syria within months. While Quwatli's Istiqlal Party lobbied the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini {{to set up a}} financial support network for the rebellion, Quwatli had already secured the funneling of funds and arms from the Hejaz and also diverted some of the military aid to the Jerusalem-based committee. As the revolt's initial momentum began to recede in mid-1926, bickering between opposition leaders, inside and outside of Syria, increased significantly. Quwatli was accused by his rivals in Cairo of pocketing some money he raised and paying off rebels to prevent rebel raids against his family's extensive apricot orchards in the Ghouta. Tensions between Istiqlalists like Quwatli and Arslan and other Syrian nationalist leaders like al-Bakri and Shahbandar, were particularly sharp, with the latter accusing Quwatli of being out of touch from the <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revolt, and Quwatli accusing Shahbandar of treason for attempting to stop the insurrection.|$|E
5|$|Sampson's term {{in office}} was a tumultuous one. The 1928 {{legislature}} was dominated by Democrats and was not particularly responsive to Sampson's proposals. After the session, Sampson was indicted for accepting gifts from textbook companies, but the charges were later dropped. In 1929, Sampson removed Democratic political boss Ben Johnson from his post as highway commissioner. When legislators reconvened in 1930, they retaliated by stripping Sampson {{of many of his}} appointment powers and reinstalling Johnson to his post. Later in the session, Sampson proposed to allow Samuel Insull to dam the Cumberland Falls to generate hydroelectric power. The General Assembly instead voted to accept an offer from T. Coleman du Pont to purchase the falls and turn them into a state park. The Assembly voted to further restrict Sampson's powers in 1930. The end of Sampson's term was complicated by the economic <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression. He called out the Kentucky National Guard to quell a violent mine strike in Harlan County known as the Battle of Evarts. Following his term, Sampson returned to Barbourville and was re-elected as a circuit court judge. He died May 25, 1967 and was buried in Barbourville Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Though the French {{presented}} {{themselves as}} liberators, they behaved like conquerors. After acrimonious {{negotiations between the}} representatives of the new Batavian Republic and those of the French Republic, a harsh Treaty of The Hague was concluded on 16 May 1795. Apart from imposing territorial concessions and a huge indemnity, this obligated the Dutch to maintain a French army of occupation of 25,000 men. This changed the Dutch republic from a client state of England and Prussia into a French one; henceforth it would conduct a foreign and military policy dictated by France, where its predecessor had followed British dictates since 1787 (an offensive and defensive alliance of the two republics was part of the treaty), while its economic policies would in effect also be made subservient to the interests of France. However, this did not mean that it lost its independence in all respects. The program of reform that the Dutch revolutionaries attempted to put in place (however constrained by the political <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French revolution as this was to progress) was mostly driven by indigenous needs and aspirations. The political events in the Netherlands were mainly derived from Dutch initiative, with some notable exceptions. The French were responsible for {{at least one of the}} coups d'état, and the French ambassador often acted as a proconsul.|$|E
