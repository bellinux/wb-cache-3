40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} a <b>real</b> [...] <b>time</b> communication system with noisy feedback {{consisting of a}} Markov source, a forward and a backward discrete memoryless channels, and a receiver with finite memory. The objective is to design an optimal communication strategy (that is, encoding, decoding, and memory update strategies) to minimize the total expected distortion over a finite horizon. We present a sequential decomposition for the problem, which results {{in a set of}} nested optimality equations to determine optimal communication strategies. This provides a systematic methodology to determine globally optimal joint source [...] channel encoding and decoding strategies for <b>real</b> [...] <b>time</b> communication systems with noisy feedback. I. Problem Formulation Consider a <b>real</b> [...] <b>time</b> communication system with noisy feedback as shown in Figure 1. This system consists of a source, a <b>real</b> [...] <b>time</b> encoder, a noisy forward channel, a noisy backward channel, and a <b>real</b> [...] <b>time</b> decoder with finite memory.
