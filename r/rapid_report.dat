40|$|BACKGROUND: The lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), is {{a highly}} {{destructive}} pest of stored grain that is strongly resistant to the fumigant phosphine (PH 3). Phosphine resistance is due to genetic variants at the rph 2 locus that alter {{the function of the}} dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) gene. This discovery now enables direct detection of resistance variants at the rph 2 locus in field populations. RESULTS: A genotype assay was developed for direct detection of changes in distribution and frequency of a phosphine resistance allele in field populations of R. dominica. Beetles were collected from ten farms in south-east Queensland in 2006 and resampled in 2011. Resistance allele frequency increased in the period from 2006 to 2011 on organic farms with no history of phosphine use, implying that migration of phosphine-resistant R. dominica had occurred from nearby storages. CONCLUSION: Increasing resistance allele frequencies on organic farms suggest local movement of beetles and dispersal of insects from areas where phosphine has been used. This research also highlighted {{for the first time the}} utility of a genetic DNA marker in accurate and rapid determination of the distribution of phosphine-resistant insects in the grain value chain. Extending this research over larger landscapes would help in identifying resistance problems and enable timely pest management decisions. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry 69 6 June 2013 10. 1002 /ps. 3514 <b>Rapid</b> <b>Report</b> <b>Rapid</b> <b>Report</b> © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Rotenone, {{an organic}} {{pesticide}} and potent mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, causes Parkinson-like neurodegeneration in rodents and is implicated in human Parkinson’s disease. In this <b>rapid</b> <b>report,</b> rotenone induced a dose-dependent decrease in succinyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and increase in β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA in multiple human cell lines (IC 50 < 100 nM). Rotenone also inhibited [U- 13 C 6]-glucosederived [13 C]-acetyl-CoA and [13 C]-succinyl-CoA biosynthesis in SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells. These changes {{are compatible with}} a compensatory metabolic rearrangement.

40|$|Abstract Background Primary study {{selection}} between systematic reviews is inconsistent, {{and reviews}} {{on the same}} topic may reach different conclusions. Our main objective was to compare systematic reviews on negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) regarding their agreement in primary study selection. Methods This retrospective analysis was conducted {{within the framework of}} a systematic review (a full review and a subsequent <b>rapid</b> <b>report)</b> on NPWT prepared by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). For the IQWiG review and <b>rapid</b> <b>report,</b> 4 bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and CINAHL) were searched to identify systematic reviews and primary studies on NPWT versus conventional wound therapy in patients with acute or chronic wounds. All databases were searched from inception to December 2006. For the present analysis, reviews on NPWT were classified as eligible systematic reviews if multiple sources were systematically searched and the search strategy was documented. To ensure comparability between reviews, only reviews published in or after December 2004 and only studies published before June 2004 were considered. Eligible reviews were compared in respect of the methodology applied and the selection of primary studies. Results A total of 5 systematic reviews (including the IQWiG review) and 16 primary studies were analysed. The reviews included between 4 and 13 primary studies published before June 2004. Two reviews considered only randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Three reviews considered both RCTs and non-RCTs. The overall agreement in study selection between reviews was 96 % for RCTs (24 of 25 options) and 57 % for non-RCTs (12 of 21 options). Due to considerable disagreement in the citation and selection of non-RCTs, we contacted the review authors for clarification (this was not initially planned); all authors or institutions responded. According to published information and the additional information provided, most differences between reviews arose from variations in inclusion criteria or inter-author study classification, as well as from different reporting styles (citation or non-citation) for excluded studies. Conclusion The citation and selection of primary studies differ between systematic reviews on NPWT, particularly with regard to non-RCTs. Uniform methodological and reporting standards need to be applied to ensure comparability between reviews as well as the validity of their conclusions. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Progression-free {{survival}} (PFS) {{is often}} used instead of the patient-relevant endpoint overall survival (OS) in cancer clinical trials. In order for PFS to be accepted as a patient-relevant outcome within the benefit assessment of pharmaceuticals {{in accordance with the}} German Social Code, Book Five (SGB V), section 35 a, it has to be validated as a surrogate endpoint for OS in the relevant indication. As part of a <b>rapid</b> <b>report</b> the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen – IQWiG) presented methods for surrogate endpoints validation and recommendations for correlation-based procedures. These methods include the evaluation of the certainty of conclusion of study results and the correlation between estimates of surrogate outcome and patient-relevant outcome on trial-level. The correlation is estimated by sample Pearson correlation coefficient or coefficient of determination and respective confidence interval (CI). Requirements for surrogate validation are a high correlation and a high certainty of conclusion of the study results. In case of medium correlation IQWiG methods propose applying the concept of surrogate threshold effect (STE) to determine thresholds for the estimate of the surrogate endpoint. Methods: In simulation studies we investigate the requirements for a successful surrogate validation when applying a correlation-based approach. Simulation parameters are the estimates of the surrogate and the patient-relevant outcome, the correlation between them, the number of patients and the number of studies. We analyzed different scenarios in order to figure out parameters contributing to high correlation. Furthermore, we investigate requirements of the STE method, allowing conclusions on patient-relevant endpoints by means of surrogate endpoints. Finally, in consideration of IQWiG methods we analyze the challenges of surrogate validation in practical use. Results: Both, simulations of the surrogate validation using correlation-based procedure as well as an analytical derivation show low statistical power despite a medium-sized number of studies and a high true correlation. The power for = 5 studies and correlation = 0. 9 is below 6 %. A very high true correlation of = 0. 95 in at least = 25 studies would be required in order to preserve a power of 80 %, however this scenario is considered implausible in practice. Further simulations investigating the power of the method of STE showed that only one fifth of the considered scenarios have power above 80 %. However, these scenarios included parameter constellations with impractical values regarding number of studies, number of patients and effect estimate of OS. The correlation parameter as well as the parameter of the estimate of PFS barely {{have an impact on the}} power of the STE procedure. Conclusion: Our simulations show that in practical use it is quite unlikely to fulfill the condition of high correlation as defined in the <b>rapid</b> <b>report</b> of IQWiG, proposing the lower limit of confidence interval to be crucial. Despite setting the true correlation in the model to a high value, statistical power will be quite small as long as the number of studies remains low or medium which is a realistic assumption in validation of surrogate endpoints within the framework of early benefit assessment. Besides, recommendation to involve certainty of studies in the analysis remains problematic. On closer inspection of the density function of sample correlation coefficient and assuming a given true correlation we can conclude that sample correlation does not depend on the variance of the single estimates but only on sample size (representing the number of studies in the model). Therefore, patient number does not have an impact on the confidence interval of the correlation whether using weight vectors for studies or not. Application of the STE concept according to the requirements described in the <b>rapid</b> <b>report</b> appears to be rather complicated as well. We propose an alternative solution of comparing the value of STE with point estimate of the surrogate endpoint instead of its lower level of confidence interval showing low α-errors in realistic scenarios...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerns}} a hazardous event which occurred {{in an industrial}} storage tank of a ground insecticide. A preliminary post-accident approach of the hazard evaluation is performed. The <b>rapid</b> <b>report</b> {{of the presence of}} an unstable functional group in the active product and of its potential thermal instability (CHETAH indices) has led to complete this examination by an experimental study of thermal analysis using isotherm exposition measurement (DTA) or with temperature programming by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and oxidability tests (BAM). The apparent kinetics of decomposition of the active matter of the ground insecticide has been represented by a global Arrhenius law. A model designed for the simulation of heterogeneous thermal runaways based on the numerical solution of the transient mass and energy balances has been further applied to define the critical conditions of the storage and simulate its behavior. The results obtained during this analysis with the experienced feedback allowed us on one side to explain the hazardous event and especially on the other side to modify the operating protocol of the conditions of formulation of the active matter on the inert mineral support.

The cytospin FA screened for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3, and adenovirus (DAKO Diagnostics Ltd.). The specificity of the cytospin FA for all viruses was 100 %. The sensitivities for influenza A virus and RSV were 90 and 98 %, respectively, but the sensitivities for influenza B virus and adenovirus were unacceptable (14. 3 and 0 %, respectively). However, since the former viruses account for > 85 % of our isolates from clinical specimens, the cytospin FA is an excellent screening test since the positive result was available within hours.
