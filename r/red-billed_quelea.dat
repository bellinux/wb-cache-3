40|$|The {{timing of}} primary moult of adult <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Queleas</b> Quelea quelea, {{captured}} {{as they were}} completing an unusually late breeding attempt at Francistown, northern Botswana, in June 2004, was compared with the timing of moult of birds breeding {{earlier in the season}} in north-west Botswana during two earlier years, 1971 and 1972. Differences between years in the dates when local colonies finished breeding (mid-March to late June) and between two localities in the same year (mid-March and late May) were matched by corresponding differences in the estimated dates of moult onset, ranging from mid-April to mid-June. Flexibility in the timing of moult among <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Queleas</b> in southern Africa evidently enables birds to take advantage of unusually late breeding opportunities by delaying moult onset and overlapping moult and breeding {{at the end of the}} nesting cycle.

An observation Ward and Zahavi had done of <b>red-billed</b> <b>queleas</b> and the cattle egrets showed altered behavior after individually failing to find food {{in the morning and}} later in the afternoon. However, after resting in a secondary roost, these birds that failed joined other birds and flew off in a completely different direction. White wagtails and cattle egrets are two species proposed to demonstrate advertisement, with their coloring and pattern making them very noticeable and the two species often choosing open places for assemblages. There is also a large variety of finch species that have large, long-term roosting sites as well as large food searching areas.|$|R

40|$|Sexually {{selected}} ornaments often {{function as}} condition-dependent signals of quality (or “indicators”).

The plumage coloration of <b>red-billed</b> <b>queleas</b> Quelea quelea (Ploceidae) has all the hallmarks of a quality signal because it is highly variable, conspicuous, sexually dimorphic, and is displayed only during breeding. However, in this study of queleas breeding in Zimbabwe, I show that plumage is not an indicator because 1) plumage color does not correlate with physical condition or age, 2) plumage color is a genetically determined phenotype that is unresponsive to environmental variation, 3) different plumage characters have bimodal distributions, 4) plumage characters vary independently of one another, and 5) plumage color does not correlate with reproductive success.

50|$|Flocks of <b>red-billed</b> <b>queleas</b> usually {{feed on the}} ground, {{with birds}} in the rear {{constantly}} leap-frogging those in the front to exploit the next strip of fallen seeds. This behaviour creates {{the impression of a}} rolling cloud, and enables efficient exploitation of the available food. The birds also take seeds from the grass ears directly. They prefer grains of 1-2 mm in size. <b>Red-billed</b> <b>queleas</b> feed mainly on seeds {{from a wide range of}} species, including annual grasses of the genera Echinochloa, Panicum, Setaria, Sorghum, Tetrapogon and Urochloa. One survey at Lake Chad showed that two thirds of the seeds eaten belonged to only three species: Oryza barthii, Sorghum purpureosericeum and Echinochloa colona. When the supply of these seeds runs out, seeds of cereals such as barley (Hordeum disticum), teff (Eragrostis tef), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), manna (Setaria italica), millet (Panicum miliaceum), rice (Oryza sativa), wheat (Triticum), oats (Avena aestiva), as well as buckwheat (Phagopyrum esculentum) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) are eaten on a large scale. They have also been observed feeding on crushed corn from cattle feedlots, but entire maize kernels are too big for them to swallow. A single bird may eat about 15 g in seeds each day. As much as half of the diet of nestlings consists of insects, such as grasshoppers, ants, beetles, bugs, caterpillars, flies and termites, as well as snails and spiders. Insects are generally eaten during the breeding season, though winged termites are eaten at other times. Breeding females consume snail-shell fragments and calcareous grit, presumably to enable egg-shell formation. One colony in Namibia, of an estimated five million adults and five million chicks, was calculated to consume roughly 13 t of insects and 1000 t of grass seeds during its breeding cycle. At sunrise they form flocks that co-operate to find food. After a successful search, they settle to feed. In the heat of the day, they rest in the shade, preferably near water, and preen. Birds seem to prefer drinking at least twice a day. In the evening, they once again fly off in search of food.|$|R

50|$|The <b>red-billed</b> <b>quelea</b> is {{sometimes}} kept and bred in captivity by hobbyists. It is ideally kept in large and high cages, with space {{to fly to}} minimise the risk of obesity. A sociable bird, the <b>red-billed</b> <b>quelea</b> tolerates mixed-species aviaries. Keeping many individuals mimics its natural occurrence in large flocks. This species withstands frosts, but requires shelter from rain and wind. Fixing hanging branches such a hawthorn in the cage facilitates nesting. Adults are given a diet of tropical seeds enriched with grass seeds, augmented by living insects such as mealworms, spiders, or boiled shredded egg during the breeding season. Fine stone grit and calcium sources, such as shell grit and cuttlebone, provide nutrients as well. If provided with material like fresh grass or coconut fibre they can be bred.|$|E
5000|$|Quelea [...] is a genus {{of small}} {{passerine}} birds {{that belongs to}} the weaver family Ploceidae, confined to Africa.

40|$|The {{epidemiologic}} role of passerine {{birds in}} the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) remains controversial. However, confirmed natural infections with HPAIV in Passeriformes, their close contact to poultry and humans, and their role as a human food source indicate a need for increased research on passerines. To date, {{there are only a}} few studies on viral shedding and pathomorphologic changes in songbirds infected with HPAIV. To investigate susceptibility, clinical outcome, virus spread, and pathomorphology, the authors inoculated oculo-oronasally 22 <b>red-billed</b> <b>queleas</b> (Quelea quelea) and 11 blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) with A/Cygnus cygnus/Germany/R 65 / 2006 (H 5 N 1) using 2 different doses of either 104 EID 50 (50 % egg infective dose) or 10 6 EID 50 per animal. They monitored all birds for clinical signs and oropharyngeal and cloacal virus shedding. They also performed immuno-histochemistry and obtained molecular virologic data by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in tissue samples. In contrast to blackcaps, where 100 % of the infected individuals died, queleas were much less susceptible, with a mortality of 82 % and 18 %, depending on the doses applied. In both species, the virus was shed within 3 to 6 days postinfection, mainly via the respiratory tract. Viral antigen was detected in 100 % of the succumbed birds, particularly in the central nervous system. In blackcaps, the heart, lungs, and pancreas were mainly infected. In contrast, the pancreas was predominantly affected in queleas, whereas the heart and the lower respiratory tract were of minor relevance.

50|$|The savannah, {{home to the}} {{greatest}} herds on Earth, {{is the subject of}} the second instalment. Despite its timeless appearance it is actually Africa’s youngest landscape, shaped by the weather and the animals themselves. As the continent dried, rainforest trees dwindled and were replaced by swathes of open woodland, thickets and grassland. Elephants, drawn from the rainforests around three million years ago, are {{the greatest}} architects of the land and are filmed pushing over trees. Primates also moved into the savannah, beginning with the ancestors of modern baboons. Grass is a vital element of the ecosystem here. Grazing herds trim the grasses, promoting rigorous growth and more numerous varieties. Seasonal rains and fires also shape the environment of the savannah. After rainfall, the plentiful grass seed triggers a race to breed for millions of <b>red-billed</b> <b>queleas.</b> Marabou storks pick armyworms from the grass and quelea chicks from their nests. The dry season can last eight months, forcing many herbivores to migrate in search of water. Wildebeest follow the rains, while elephants travel a network of paths between waterholes. Buffalos rely on tough grasses to sustain them through the lean times, but as they weaken, lions sense an opportunity. Long, narration-free, slow-motion sequences of lion and cheetah hunts are accompanied by evocative orchestral music. Night-time cameras follow rarely seen animals including aardvarks, servals and an African wild cat. The reasons for this abundance of life are the savannah’s vast size, fast recycling of nutrients and the adaptability of its wildlife.|$|R
50|$|Despite its {{preference}} for ground-dwelling avian prey, a surprisingly {{considerable number of}} water birds may also be attacked. Waterfowl known to be attacked include the 1.18 kg South African shelduck (Tadorna cana), 1 kg yellow-billed duck (Anas undulata), the 4.43 kg spur-winged goose (Plectropterus gambensis) (Africa’s largest waterfowl species) and especially the peculiar, overly bold and aggressive 1.76 kg Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiaca), {{which is one of}} the main prey species for martial eagles in Kruger National Park. Larger wading birds are also fairly frequently attacked including herons and egrets, flamingoes storks, ibises, spoonbills and cranes. The diversity and number of storks taken is particularly impressive. They are known to take 8 species of stork, ranging from the smallest known species, the 1.08 kg African openbill (Anastomus lamelligerus), to the tallest species in the world, the 6.16 kg, 1.5 m-tall saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis). One naturalists observed up to a half dozen attacks in different parts of Africa on 3.45 kg white storks (Ciconia ciconia). Short of three attacks on spotted thick-knees (Burhinus capensis), which weigh about 0.42 kg, so far as is known small waders or shorebirds are ignored as prey. Other assorted avian prey may consists of ostrich (Struthio camelus) chicks (frequently resulting in the immediate ire of protective ostrich parents), sandgrouse, pigeons and doves, hornbills and crows. Beyond occasional captures of other birds of prey (covered later), one other impressive avian prey species is the southern ground hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri), which at 3.77 kg is probably the world’s largest hornbill. At the other end of the scale, some martial eagles may capture a few small social species of passerine, which are exceptionally small prey (the smallest recorded prey species for the eagle overall), potentially consisting of the 18.6 g <b>red-billed</b> <b>queleas</b> (Quelea quelea) and the 27.4 g sociable weavers (Philetairus socius), as practically every meat-eating bird in Africa may be attracted to these species’ colonial abundance.|$|R

50|$|Many weaver {{species are}} gregarious and breed colonially. The birds build their nests {{together}} for protection, often several to a branch.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{completion of}} the rainy season and nesting of granivorous birds between October and November in the Sudano-sahelian region of Senegal often results in very extensive bird damage to cereal crops. This occurs from both increased bird populations, due {{to the presence of}} juveniles as well as from their accompanying change in diet from insects to seeds. The damage is caused by several species of birds, most notable the <b>Red-billed</b> Dioch (<b>Quelea</b> quelea) and the Village and Black-headed Weavers (Ploceus cuculiatus and Ploceus capitalis). The Buffalo Weaver (Bubalornis albirostris) and the Glossy Starling Lamprotornis chalybaeus) also are at times serious crop depredators. Traditionally, farmers employ many different frightening techniques to chase or scare birds from their crops. The methods provide at best only temporary relief and require considerable time and energy. A possible solution to the bird problem involves the use of chemical repellents applied directly to the ripening grain. The purpose of the trial reported here was to evaluate methiocarb or Mesurol [4 -(methylthio) - 3, 5 xylyl N - methylcarbamate] as a bird repellent on ripening sorghum. The study was undertaken {{as a part of the}} Regional UNDP/FAO Project “Research into the Control of Grain-eating Birds,” aimed at the development and improvement of control techniques to prevent or reduce bird damage to cereal crops. The effectiveness of methiocarb as a nonlethal bird repellent has been demonstrated on several types of crops, among them cherries (Guarino, et al., 1974), blueberries (Bollengier, et al., 1973), sorghum (Mott and Lewis, 1975) and rice (DeHaven, et al., 1971). Trials by DeGrazio and DeHaven (1974) on wheat and rice in eastern Africa also have shown promise. Likewise, the Quelea Project has obtained some success with it against Passer Iuteus, Quelea quelea, and ploceus capitalis when applied to both ripening millet and rice (Bruggers, 1975, 1977) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{explicit}} spatio-temporal {{model of the}} movements of a nomadic granivorous bird, the <b>Red-billed</b> Quelea(Quelea <b>quelea),</b> in southern Africa. These abundant birds breed colonially whenever conditions permit, traveling long distances to find breeding habitat or to avoid food shortage. They breed in the wet season and shift about in dry seasons to concentrations of seeds of preferred annual grasses. Ecological and behavioral data suggest that, {{at the start of}} the rains, grass seeds germinate after a threshold quantity of 60 mm rain has fallen, forcing the birds to move out to zones where seeds have not yet germinated. When rain reaches the latter areas, the birds are forced to move again,usually returning in "early-rains migrations" in the direction whence they came. By this time, an additional 240 mm of rain(300 mm in total) needs to have fallen within a 6 -week period for the new grass to produce fresh seed. Breeding may then begin. Adult birds subsequently move on a "breeding migration" to wherever at least 300 mm of rain has fallen for further nesting attempts in the season. Using estimates of rainfall derived from Meteosat Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) data, a forecasting model has been devised that shows, at wee'"klyintervals, those areas where (a) the wet season has not yet started, (b) the "early-rains migration" threshold has been exceeded, (c) the threshold to permit breeding has been exceeded, and (d) conditions are no longer suitable for the establishment of new colonies. We review the simple algorithms necessary to produce a realistic model for predicting when and where quelea will breed, and describe the results for validating it using data on breeding by southern African populations of quelea over the past four breeding seasons 2001 - 02 to 2004 - 05.

40|$|Birds {{are often}} serious pests of rice. The {{small size of}} this cereal at all stages of its {{ripening}} makes it attractive for the small, seed-eating birds. Considerable damage also is inflicted during early stages of growth when germinating seedlings are depredated by grainivores, and several species of aquatic birds trample the fields in search of food. The migratory blackbirds (Agelaius species and others) eat various grains across the U. S. A. and Mexico, while huge numbers of <b>red-billed</b> weaver bird (<b>Quelea</b> quelea) account for grain losses up to 20 % in several rice-growing African countries (Efferson, 1952). Although rice is the staple food {{for the majority of}} India, information available on bird damage to paddy is inadequate. Spotted munia (Hamid Ali et aI., 1976; Saha and Mukherjee, 1978; Verghese and Chakravarthy, 1981) and baya (Mathew, 1976; Hamid Ali et aI., 1976) are the recognized pests of rice. A host of insectivorous birds prey upon the abundant insect pests of rice. Studies on ecology of rice field birds and their foraging patterns will aid in formulating the best possible measures to prevent damage. Hence, in this preliminary study, data on the density and diversity of birds visiting a paddy field, their spatial and temporal distribution, feeding behavior, and foraging strategy were collected...|$|R

5000|$|Based {{on recent}} DNA-analysis, the <b>red-billed</b> <b>quelea</b> is sister to a clade that consist of both {{remaining}} {{species of the}} genus Quelea, namely Q. cardinalis and Q. erythrops.

50|$|The <b>red-billed</b> <b>quelea</b> is {{regarded}} as the most numerous undomesticated bird on earth, with the total post-breeding population sometimes peaking at an estimated 1½ billion individuals. The species is specialised on feeding on seeds of annual grass species, which may be ripe, or still green, but have not germinated yet. Since the availability of these seeds varies with time and space, occurring in particular weeks after the local off-set of rains, queleas migrate as a strategy to ensure year-round food availability. The consumption of a lot of food with a high energy content is needed for the queleas to gain enough fat to allow migration to new feeding areas. When breeding, it selects areas with thorny or spiny vegetation below 1000 m elevation, such as Acacia, and lowveld. While foraging for food, they may fly 50 - 65 km each day and return to the roosting or nesting site in the evening. Small groups of red-billed queleas often mix with different weaver birds (Ploceus) and bishops (Euplectes), and in western Africa they may join the Sudan golden sparrow and various estrildids. <b>Red-billed</b> <b>quelea</b> may also roosts together with weavers, estrildids and barn swallows.

50|$|In the {{breeding}} season, males are diversely coloured. These differences in plumage do not signal condition, probably serving instead for {{the recognition of}} individual birds. However, {{the intensity of the}} red on the bills is regarded an indicator for the animal's quality and social dominance. <b>Red-billed</b> <b>quelea</b> males mate with one female only within one breeding cycle. There are usually three eggs in each clutch (though the full range is one to five) of approximately 18 mm long and 13 mm in diameter. The eggs are light bluish or greenish in colour, sometimes with some dark spots. Some clutches contain six eggs, but large clutches {{may be the result of}} other females dumping an egg in a stranger's nest. Both sexes share the incubation of the eggs during the day, but the female alone does so during the cool night, and feeds during the day when air temperatures are high enough to sustain the development of the embryo. The breeding cycle of the <b>red-billed</b> <b>quelea</b> is one of the shortest known in any bird. Incubation takes nine or ten days. After the chicks hatch, they are fed for some days with protein-rich insects. Later the nestlings mainly get seeds. The young birds fledge after about two weeks in the nest.
