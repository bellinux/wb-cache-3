50|$|The <b>rusty-margined</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Myiozetetes cayanensis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Tyrannidae, the tyrant flycatchers.|$|E
50|$|Migratory {{bird species}} include swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus), plumbeous kite (Ictinia plumbea), blue ground dove (Claravis pretiosa), dark-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus melacoryphus), white-collared swift (Streptoprocne zonaris), Sick's swift (Chaetura meridionalis), black jacobin (Florisuga fusca), black-throated mango (Anthracothorax nigricollis), white-rumped monjita (Xolmis velatus), yellow-browed tyrant (Satrapa icterophrys), <b>rusty-margined</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Myiozetetes cayanensis), {{streaked}} flycatcher (Myiodynastes maculatus), piratic flycatcher (Legatus leucophaius), fork-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus savana), white-winged becard (Pachyramphus polychopterus), red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus), lined seedeater (Sporophila lineola) and sooty grassquit (Tiaris fuliginosus).|$|E
5000|$|As the {{specific}} epithet similis (Latin for [...] "the similar one") indicates, this species looks much like its closest living relative the <b>rusty-margined</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Myiozetetes cayanensis), and {{also like the}} white-bearded flycatcher (Phelpsia inornatus), white-ringed flycatcher (Conopias albovittatus) and lesser kiskadee (Pitangus/Philohydor lictor). In fact, except at close range, these are all but indistinguishable from appearance alone. They and the two larger similar species mentioned above share much of their range. Though they all are apparently fairly close relatives, the group to which they seem to belong also includes species with rather different head-pattern, like the grey-capped flycatcher which also belongs to Myiozetetes.|$|E
50|$|The adult Myiozetetes flycatchers are c. 16-18 cm {{long and}} weigh 24-30 g. The upperparts are olive-brown, and {{the wings and}} tail are brown with only faint rufous fringes. The underparts are yellow and the throat is white. Young birds lack the red-orange crown stripe of the adult, and have {{chestnut}} fringes to the wing and tail feathers. The best distinction between the species is the head pattern: Vermilion-crowned, social and <b>rusty-margined</b> <b>flycatchers</b> have strong black-and white head markings like the great kiskadee, whereas grey-capped and dusky-chested flycatchers have greyish heads, with a short weak eyestripe in the former.|$|R
