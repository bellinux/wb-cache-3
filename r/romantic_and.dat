Imagists use free verse.|$|E
5|$|American Beauty is a 1999 American drama film {{directed}} by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball. Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, a 42-year-old advertising executive {{who has a}} midlife crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). Annette Bening co-stars as Lester's materialistic wife, Carolyn, and Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter, Jane. Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, and Allison Janney also feature. The film is described by academics as a satire of American middle-class notions of beauty and personal satisfaction; analysis {{has focused on the}} film's explorations of <b>romantic,</b> <b>and</b> paternal love, sexuality, beauty, materialism, self-liberation, and redemption.|$|E
5|$|Both Avram Iancu and Unrii Squares feature {{ensembles}} of eclectic and baroque–rococo architecture, {{including the}} Palace of Justice, the Theatre, the Iuliu Maniu symmetrical street, and the New York Palace, among others. In the 19th century many houses {{were built in}} the Neo-classical, <b>Romantic</b> <b>and</b> Eclectic styles. Also dating to that period are the two-towered Neo-classical Calvinist church (1829–50), its new college building of 1801, and the City Hall (1843–46) in the marketplace, by Antal Kagerbauer.|$|E

5|$|Harley's co-creator, Paul Dini, {{describes}} {{their relationship}} as Harley being someone {{who makes the}} Joker feel better about himself, and who can do the work {{that he does not}} want to do himself. In the 1999 one-shot comic Batman: Harley Quinn, the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting that he does care for her, that their relationship is <b>romantic,</b> <b>and</b> that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose. Removing the traditional male-female relationship, such as in the Batman: Thrillkiller storyline where the Joker (Bianca Steeplechase) is a female and involved in a lesbian relationship with Harley, their relationship lacks any aspects of violence or subjugation.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's early <b>romantic</b> <b>and</b> sexual {{relationships}} were exclusively with men. Keynes {{had been in}} relationships while at Eton and Cambridge; significant among these early partners were Dilly Knox and Daniel Macmillan. Keynes was open about his affairs, and from 1901 to 1915 kept separate diaries in which he tabulated his many sexual encounters. Keynes's relationship and later close friendship with Macmillan was to be fortunate, as Macmillan's company first published his tract Economic Consequences of the Peace.|$|E

5|$|Cardus's {{approach}} to cricket writing was innovative, turning what {{had previously been}} largely a factual form into vivid description and criticism; he is considered by contemporaries to have influenced every subsequent cricket writer. Although he achieved his largest readership for his cricket reports and books, he considered music criticism as his principal vocation. Without any formal musical training, he was initially influenced by the older generation of critics, in particular Samuel Langford and Ernest Newman, but developed his own individual style of criticism—subjective, <b>romantic</b> <b>and</b> personal, {{in contrast to the}} objective analysis practised by Newman. Cardus's opinions and judgments were often forthright and unsparing, which sometimes caused friction with leading performers. Nevertheless, his personal charm and gregarious manner enabled him to form lasting friendships in the cricketing and musical worlds, with among others Newman, Sir Thomas Beecham and Sir Donald Bradman.|$|E

Eve discourages both of her children from pursuing a relationship with Chad, fearing he will be a bad influence on her daughter in the same way Julian was on her teenage self. Whitney and Chad keep their <b>romantic</b> <b>and</b> sexual encounters secret for years while he pretends to be in love with Simone. The love triangle continues until Simone catches Whitney kissing Chad. Simone breaks up publicly with Chad and tells everyone in Harmony about his relationship with Whitney.

The producers initially wanted to film in Falls City, Nebraska, where the real-life events had taken place; however, budget constraints meant that principal photography had {{to occur in}} Texas. The film's cinematography uses dim and artificial lighting throughout and was influenced {{by a variety of}} styles, including neorealism and the films of Martin Scorsese, while the soundtrack consisted primarily of country, blues, and rock music from the film. The film's themes, which have been explored by many scholars, include the nature of <b>romantic</b> <b>and</b> platonic relationships, the causes of violence against LGBT people, transgender people and the gender binary, and the relationship among social class, race, and gender.|$|E
5|$|German {{classical}} music includes works {{by some of}} the world's most well-known composers. Dieterich Buxtehude composed oratorios for organ, which influenced the later work of Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel; these men were influential composers of the Baroque period. During his tenure as violinist and teacher at the Salzburg cathedral, Augsburg-born composer Leopold Mozart mentored one of the most noted musicians of all time: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Ludwig van Beethoven was a crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras. Carl Maria von Weber and Felix Mendelssohn were important in the early Romantic period. Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms composed in the Romantic idiom. Richard Wagner was known for his operas. Richard Strauss was a leading composer of the late <b>Romantic</b> <b>and</b> early modern eras. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Hans Zimmer are important composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries.|$|E

Lane blames Pete's methods for losing the account, and Pete responds by citing Lane's redundant role at the firm and challenging his sexuality. To the surprise and shock of the other partners, Lane responds by challenging Pete to a fistfight. Pete and Lane exchange blows until Lane wins, leaving a bloodied Pete on the office floor. Bruised, shaken, and humiliated, Pete retreats to his office. Joan goes to comfort Lane, only Lane misinterprets her affection as <b>romantic</b> <b>and</b> kisses her. Joan, startled, stands and opens the door, but does not leave.

40|$|To a {{considerable}} extent, Romantic Orientalist literature {{is founded on}} scholasticism, authentication, quotation of antiquarian sources, in other words, on paratext. It constitutes in many respects an oxymoronic, though fascinating and dynamic, symbiosis of repetition / replication and creative imagination / invention. By focusing on Robert Southey’s art of quotation in his extraordinarily abundant notes to his orientalist narrative verse this essay seeks to establish paratext as an integral, formative aspect of <b>Romantic</b> Orientalism <b>and</b> Romantic-period poetics, illustrating the hybridity of the <b>Romantic</b> genius <b>and</b> <b>Romantic</b> poetic creation, <b>and</b> challenging common assumptions about a sublime, universal Romantic-period poetry...|$|R
5|$|One of {{the crucial}} points {{is that there are}} several {{different}} sources for the Battle itself, including poems and songs in Old English, Old Norse, Old Welsh, Middle English, Latin, and Anglo-Norman, highlighting a wide potential of sources in order to glean information about the battle from all sides of the campaign. Furthermore, while these sources might be seen as biased due to national origin and underlying <b>romantic</b> <b>and</b> heroic narrative constructions of the battle for each side, some of the sources, such as the Chronicle work as points of reference to the more lyrical constructions presented in other popular narrative formats. Although there is a relative lack of iron-clad primary sources that are completely unbiased, by taking into account all of these sources, historians and literary scholars can gain a fuller image of the military maneuvers and actions taken by the respective leaders of armies involved in this battle.|$|E
5|$|She {{has been}} the subject of <b>romantic</b> <b>and</b> ideologically-driven biographies by ancient and modern writers. The Augustan History is the clearest example of an ideological account of Zenobia's life, and its author {{acknowledged}} that it was written to criticize the emperor Gallienus. According to the Augustan History, Gallienus was weak because he allowed a woman to rule part of the empire and Zenobia was an abler sovereign than the emperor. The narrative changed as the Augustan History moved on to the life of Claudius Gothicus, a lauded and victorious emperor, with the author characterizing Zenobia's protection of the eastern frontier as a wise delegation of power by Claudius. When the Augustan History reached the biography of Aurelian, the author's view of Zenobia changed dramatically; the queen is depicted as a guilty, insolent, proud coward. Her wisdom was discredited and her actions deemed the result of manipulation by advisers.|$|E
5|$|Sometime around 1850, PedroII began having {{discreet}} {{affairs with}} other women.

Throughout his life, the Emperor held onto a hope of finding a soulmate, something he felt cheated of due to {{the necessity of a}} marriage of state to a woman for whom he never felt passion. This is but one instance illustrating his dual identity: one who assiduously carried out his duty in the role of emperor which destiny had assigned to him and another who considered the imperial office an unrewarding burden and who was happier in the worlds of literature and science.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{the development of}} <b>romantic</b> relationships <b>and</b> sexual experiences of young adults with cerebral palsy (CP) and {{the physical and emotional}} obstacles they experience with sexuality. Regarding the ICF domains we investigated whether this development is associated with demographic and physical characteristics, peer group activities and dating and psychological and environmental factors. We compared the <b>romantic</b> relationships <b>and</b> sexual experiences of this group with an age-appropriate Dutch reference population. Design: Prospective longitudinal study with three biannual assessments. 	 Setting: Eight rehabilitation centers and departments in the southwestern regions of the Netherlands. Participants: Young adults (N= 103, 61 men, 42 women) with CP without cognitive disabilities, ranging from 16 to 20 years old at the first assessment, 82 % Gross Motor Function Classification System level I-II. Interventions: Not applicable. Main outcome measures: sexual interest, <b>romantic</b> relationships <b>and</b> sexual activity. Results: During the four years, the sexual experience of the participants increased significantly for all the sexual milestones evaluated. Compared with an age-appropriate Dutch reference population, young adults with CP participated at a lower level in <b>romantic</b> relationships <b>and</b> sexual activities, but had an equal sexual interest at the final assessment. Peer group activities and dating favored development of <b>romantic</b> relationships <b>and</b> a sexual career. Age and gross motor functioning explained 20 % of the variance in experience with intercourse. In addition, self-efficacy, self-esteem, sexual esteem and perceived attractiveness contributed significantly to having current <b>romantic</b> relationships <b>and</b> to intercourse experience. Conclusions: Young ambulatory adults with CP had comparable sexual interests and they had increasing experiences with <b>romantic</b> relationships <b>and</b> sexual activities during the transition from late adolescence to young adulthood. Social participation and aspects of a positive self image were positively associated with <b>romantic</b> relationships <b>and</b> sexual experiences...|$|R
