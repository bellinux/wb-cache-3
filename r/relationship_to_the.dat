5|$|Characteristics of lava dome eruptions include shallow, long-period and hybrid seismic activity, {{which is}} {{attributed}} to excess fluid pressures in the contributing vent chamber. Other characteristics of lava domes include their spherical dome shape, cycles of dome growth over long periods, and sudden onsets of violent explosive activity. The average rate of dome growth {{may be used as}} a rough indicator of magma supply, but it shows no systematic <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> timing or characteristic of lava dome explosions.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom at present, the {{mainstream}} approach towards representative standing is broad and liberal. The {{focus is on}} whether illegality or some other ground of review can be shown, rather than the applicant's <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> illegality complained of. If some unlawfulness can be demonstrated, the courts tend to grant a remedy even where the applicant is not directly affected by the executive decision.|$|E

5|$|Pietro Boyesen (1819–1882) was a Danish {{photographer}} who {{spent most of}} his professional life in Rome. Boyesen had a talent for composition and characterization. In contrast to the boring studio portraits which were so common at the time, Boyesen would have his subjects pose outdoors in intimate Roman settings. By playing with the subjects clothes and their <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surroundings, Boyesen would produce works presenting a somewhat timid but intimate charm.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to future}} history works by other authors such as Isaac Asimov, Le Guin's fictional works {{set in the}} Hainish {{universe}} explore the idea of human society expanding across the galaxy. Books like The Dispossessed, The Left Hand of Darkness, and The Word for World is Forest also explore the effects of various social and political systems. Le Guin's later Hainish novels also challenge contemporary ideas about gender, ethnic differences, the value of ownership, and human beings' <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> natural world.|$|E

5|$|The CGS {{system had}} two units of energy, the erg that {{was related to}} {{mechanics}} and the calorie that was related to thermal energy; so {{only one of them}} (the erg) could bear a coherent <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> base units.

In addition to a book collection significantly larger than that of the former library, the new building houses a wide range of amenities including cafés, an auditorium, and community rooms. The striking architecture is characterised by the fifth floor's cantilever over the entrance plaza, a central atrium criss-crossed by staircases, and the building's transparency and <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> urban context.|$|E
5|$|The raphines are {{sometimes}} separated {{as a distinct}} family Raphidae, and their affinities were for long uncertain. They were initially placed in the ratites due to their peculiar, flightlessness-related apomorphies, and a <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rallidae has also been suggested. Osteological and molecular data, however, agrees that placement in the Columbidae is more appropriate. Many different affinities have historically been suggested for the dodo, including {{that it was a}} small ostrich, a rail, an albatross, or a vulture.|$|E

5|$|A {{large body}} of Western Chalukya {{literature}} in Kannada language was produced {{during the reign of}} the Western Chalukya Empire (9731200 CE) in what is now southern India. This dynasty, which ruled most of the western Deccan in South India is sometimes called the Kalyani Chalukya Dynasty after its royal capital at Kalyani (now Basavakalyan) and sometimes called the Later Chalukya Dynasty for its theoretical <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 6th-century Chalukya dynasty of Badami. For a brief period (11621183), the Kalachuris of Kalyani, a dynasty of kings who had earlier migrated to the Karnataka region from central India and served as vassals for several generations, exploited the growing weakness of their overlords and annexed the Kalyani. Around 1183, the last Chalukya scion, Someshvara IV, overthrew the Kalachuris to regain control of the royal city. But his efforts were in vain, as other prominent Chalukya vassals in the Deccan, the Hoysalas, the Kakatiyas and the Seunas destroyed the remnants of the Chalukya power.|$|E
5|$|After Edward I's death, Arundel {{became part}} of the {{opposition}} to the new king Edward II, and his favourite Piers Gaveston. In 1311 {{he was one of the}} so-called Lords Ordainers who assumed control of government from the king. Together with Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, he was responsible for the death of Gaveston in 1312. From this point on, however, his <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king became more friendly. This was to a large extent due to his association with the king's new favourite Hugh Despenser the Younger, whose daughter was married to Arundel's son. Arundel supported the king in suppressing rebellions by Roger Mortimer and other Marcher Lords, and eventually also Thomas of Lancaster. For this he was awarded with land and offices.|$|E
