25|$|The {{overhead}} {{sour gas}} from the stripper contains hydrogen, methane, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, propane, and, perhaps, some butane and heavier components. That sour gas {{is sent to the}} <b>refinery's</b> central <b>gas</b> processing plant for removal of the hydrogen sulfide in the <b>refinery's</b> main amine <b>gas</b> treating unit and through a series of distillation towers for recovery of propane, butane and pentane or heavier components. The residual hydrogen, methane, ethane, and some propane is used as <b>refinery</b> fuel <b>gas.</b> The <b>hydrogen</b> sulfide removed and recovered by the amine gas treating unit is subsequently converted to elemental sulfur in a Claus process unit or to sulfuric acid in a wet sulfuric acid process or in the conventional Contact Process.|$|R

40|$|A {{previous}} application brief [1] {{has shown that}} a 7890 A GC configured with three parallel channels provides a complete <b>refinery</b> <b>gas</b> analysis (RGA) within six minutes. The configuration for fast RGA in the brief has been updated by adding a fifth valve, which can now be supported by the 7890 A GC. The updated configuration is almost {{the same as the}} previous one except for the third chan-nel (TCD) for H 2 analysis using N 2 or Ar as carrier gas to improve H 2 detectability and linearity. The updated configuration uses a 10 -port valve with a pre-column for backflushing late-eluting components while H 2 is separating on the molsieve column instead of a three-way splitter plus split/splitless inlet. <b>Refinery</b> <b>gases</b> are mixtures of various gas streams produced in refinery processes.
