25|$|Investigators later {{discovered}} that the recovered accident rudder PCU was much more sensitive to bench-tests than other new PCU's. The exact mechanism of the failure involved the servo valve, which remains dormant and cold {{for much of the}} flight at high altitude, seizing after being injected with hot hydraulic fluid that has been in continuous action throughout the plane. This specific condition occurred in fewer than 1% of the lab tests, but explained the rudder malfunction that caused Flight 427 to crash. The jam left no trace of evidence after it occurred and a Boeing engineer later found that a jam under this controlled condition could also lead to the slide moving in the opposite direction than that commanded. In light of this, Boeing felt that the test results were not real-world and not applicable due to the extremes under which the valve was tested. Boeing stated that the rudder reversal was more likely psychological, likening it to examples when a human panics and intends to step on the brake during an automotive accident, but accidentally presses on the gas pedal instead while under duress. The FAA's official position was that there was not enough evidence for probable cause of <b>rudder</b> <b>system</b> failure.|$|E

Beam was therefore increased, with greater width added {{at the ends of}} the armored citadel to allow a greater distance between the side wall and the torpedo bulkhead. The stern section of the torpedo bulkhead was also strengthened structurally to allow it to better contain the force of an underwater explosion. A triple bottom was also included in the design, the first time a feature was used in a German warship design. The loss of Bismarck in May 1941 also influenced the design; two large skegs were added to the outboard shafts to protect them and increase support for the stern while in drydock.

Two methods of analyzing system with respect to resonant jumps are described: the analytical method and the simulation method. When performing the analytical analysis based on the describing function approach, the analysis of the variations of important parameters, including saturation, is performed. Then, the confi rmation of the results of analytical analysis is illustrated by the simulation method.

40|$|Charts {{showing the}} {{variation}} in dynamic stability with the rudder hinge-moment characteristics are presented.

This dynamic instability is increased by viscous-friction in the <b>rudder</b> control <b>system.</b> The presence of solid friction in the <b>rudder</b> control <b>system</b> will cause steady oscillations of constant amplitude if the floating angle of the rudder per unit angle of sideslip is stabilizing and greater than a certain critical value that depends on other airplane parameters, such as vertical-tail area and airplane moment of inertia about the vertical axis. The amplitude of the steady oscillation is proportional to the amount of friction and is generally quite small but increases as the condition of dynamic instability is approached. An approximate method of calculating the amplitudes of the steady oscillation is explained and is illustrated by a numerical example. A more accurate step-by-step calculation of the motion is also made and it is shown that the agreement with the approximate method is good...|$|R
