5|$|Exponentiating a <b>real</b> <b>number</b> to {{a complex}} power is {{formally}} a different operation from that for the corresponding complex number. However, in the common case of a positive <b>real</b> <b>number</b> the principal value is the same.|$|E

5|$|The series {{definition}} {{above is}} {{a simple way to}} define the <b>real</b> <b>number</b> named by a decimal expansion. A complementary approach is tailored to the opposite process: for a given <b>real</b> <b>number,</b> define the decimal expansion(s) to name it.|$|E
25|$|The sets of {{positive}} <b>real</b> <b>numbers</b> and negative <b>real</b> <b>numbers</b> are often noted R+ and R−, respectively; R+ and R− are also used. The non-negative <b>real</b> <b>numbers</b> can be noted R≥0 but one often sees this set noted R+ ∪ {0}. In French mathematics, the positive <b>real</b> <b>numbers</b> and negative <b>real</b> <b>numbers</b> commonly include zero, and these sets are noted respectively ℝ+ and ℝ−. In this understanding, the respective sets without zero are called strictly positive <b>real</b> <b>numbers</b> and strictly negative <b>real</b> <b>numbers,</b> and are noted ℝ+* and ℝ−*.|$|R

5|$|For example, the {{subset of}} the integers{0,1,2} is {{contained}} in the interval of real numbers, which is convex. The Shapley–Folkman lemma implies that every point in {{is the sum of}} an integer from{0,1} and a <b>real</b> <b>number</b> from.|$|E
5|$|Taking a {{negative}} <b>real</b> <b>number</b> b to a rational power u/v, where u/v is in lowest terms, yields a positive real result if u is even, and hence v is odd, because then b'u is positive; and yields {{a negative}} real result, if u and v are both odd, because then b'u is negative. The case of odd u and even v cannot be treated this way within the reals, {{since there is}} no <b>real</b> <b>number</b> x such that , the value of b'u/v in this case must use the imaginary unit i, as described more fully in the section § Powers of complex numbers.|$|E
40|$|<b>Real</b> <b>numbers</b> {{are divided}} into {{rational}} and irrational numbers. Students learn about this division already in elementary school, but they become more familiar with it in secondary school. It is not so well known that <b>real</b> <b>numbers</b> are also divided into algebraic and transcendental <b>numbers.</b> <b>Real</b> <b>numbers</b> which are zeros of some polynomial with rational coefficients are called algebraic numbers. On the other hand, <b>real</b> <b>numbers</b> that are not zeros of any such polynomial are called transcendental numbers. This division of <b>real</b> <b>numbers</b> into algebraic and transcendental numbers represents the main topic of this diploma thesis. The set of algebraic <b>real</b> <b>numbers</b> and the set of transcendental <b>real</b> <b>numbers</b> are both infinite, but despite their infinity, we can still determine which is larger. The main goal of this diploma thesis is to present the proof that there are significantly more transcendental <b>real</b> <b>numbers</b> than algebraic <b>real</b> <b>numbers,</b> what may seem surprising, since we mostly operate with algebraic <b>real</b> <b>numbers</b> in elementary and secondary schools. Namely, almost the only transcendental <b>real</b> <b>numbers</b> that we learn about at school are the ratio between the circumference and {{the diameter of the}} circle, that is, the number π, and the basis of the natural logarithm, the number e...|$|R

5|$|Powers of a {{positive}} <b>real</b> <b>number</b> are always positive real numbers. The solution of x2=4, however, can be either 2 or −2. The principal value of 41/2 is 2, but −2 is also a valid square root.

5|$|After the war, Yugoslavia's new {{communist}} government announced that Sajmište had held {{a total of}} 100,000 prisoners during the war, half of whom were killed. The Yugoslav State War Crimes Commission later estimated {{that as many as}} 40,000 may {{have been killed in the}} camp, including 7,000 Jews. According to the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia, the overall death toll was greatly exaggerated by the communists for political purposes, and the <b>real</b> <b>number</b> of inmates was about 50,000, with 20,000 killed. It is estimated that half of all Serbian Jews were killed at Sajmište. The Staro Sajmište memorial estimates that 23,000 people perished in the camp, of whom 10,000 were Jews.|$|E
5|$|By {{allowing}} u to vary {{over all}} possible integers, an infinite family of solutions {{can be generated}} from a single solution (x1,y1). If the solutions are required to be positive integers (x>0,y>0), only {{a finite number of}} solutions may be possible. This restriction on the acceptable solutions allows some systems of Diophantine equations with more unknowns than equations to have a finite number of solutions; this is impossible for a system of linear equations when the solutions can be any <b>real</b> <b>number</b> (see Underdetermined system).|$|E
5|$|The {{important}} {{mathematical constant}} , sometimes called Euler's number, is approximately equal to 2.718 {{and is the}} base of the natural logarithm. Although exponentiation of e could, in principle, be treated the same as exponentiation of any other <b>real</b> <b>number,</b> such exponentials turn out to have particularly elegant and useful properties. Among other things, these properties allow exponentials of e to be generalized in a natural way to other types of exponents, such as complex numbers or even matrices, while coinciding with the familiar meaning of exponentiation with rational exponents.|$|E

5|$|Justinian's {{first and}} second {{depositions}} were followed by internal disorder, with successive revolts and emperors lacking legitimacy or support. In this climate, the Umayyads consolidated their control of Armenia and Cilicia, and began preparing a renewed offensive against Constantinople. In Byzantium, the general Leo the Isaurian (r. 717–741) had just seized the throne in March 717, when the massive Muslim army under the famed Umayyad prince and general Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik began moving towards the imperial capital. The Caliphate's army and navy, led by Maslama, numbered some 120,000 men and 1,800 ships according to the sources. Whatever the <b>real</b> <b>number,</b> {{it was a huge}} force, far larger than the imperial army. Thankfully for Leo and the Empire, the capital's sea walls had recently been repaired and strengthened. In addition, the emperor concluded an alliance with the Bulgar khan Tervel, who agreed to harass the invaders' rear.|$|E
5|$|The Fabulous Moolah's first reign is {{the longest}} reign, and is officially {{recognized}} to be 10,170 days, due to WWE not recognizing title changes between 1956 and 1984 (her first reign's <b>real</b> <b>number</b> is 3,651 days, which is still the longest reign). Moolah technically also has the most reigns at 8, but since the WWE does not recognize the title changes between 1956 and 1984, Moolah only has 4 reigns and Trish Stratus has the most reigns with 7. Mickie James has the shortest reign with 1 hour. Wendi Richter is the youngest champion {{at the age of}} 22 years and 10 months, and Moolah is the oldest at the age of 76 years and 106 days. Bertha Faye is the heaviest champion and The Kat is the lightest champion. Chyna is the only undefeated champion. The final champion was Layla, in her first and only reign.|$|E
5|$|When the {{right-hand}} side of the equation is a positive <b>real</b> <b>number,</b> the solution corresponds to an epispiral. When the argument θ1 – θ0 equals ±90°×k, the cosine goes to zero and the radius goes to infinity. Thus, when k is less than one, the range of allowed angles becomes small and the force is repulsive (red curve on right in Figure7). On the other hand, when k is greater than one, the range of allowed angles increases, corresponding to an attractive force (green, cyan and blue curves on left in Figure7); the orbit of the particle can even wrap around the center several times. The possible values of the parameter k may range from zero to infinity, which corresponds to values of μ ranging from negative infinity up to the positive upper limit, L12/m. Thus, for all attractive inverse-cube forces (negative μ) there is a corresponding epispiral orbit, as for some repulsive ones (μ < L12/m), as illustrated in Figure 7. Stronger repulsive forces correspond to a faster linear motion.|$|E
