25|$|In 1966, Serra {{made his}} first sculptures out of nontraditional {{materials}} such as fiberglass and rubber. Serra's earliest work was abstract and process-based made from molten lead hurled in large splashes {{against the wall of}} a studio or exhibition space. In 1967 and 1968 he compiled a list of infinitives that served as catalysts for subsequent work: “to hurl” suggested the hurling of molten lead into crevices between wall and floor; “to roll” led to the rolling of the material into dense, metal logs. He began in 1969 to be primarily concerned with the cutting, propping or stacking of lead sheets, <b>rough</b> <b>timber,</b> etc., to create structures, some very large, supported only by their own weight. His “Prop” pieces from the late 1960s are arranged so that weight and gravity balance lead rolls and sheets. Cutting Device: Base Plate Measure (1969) consists of an assemblage of heterogeneous materials (lead, wood, stone and steel) into which two parallel cuts have been made and the results strewn around in a chance configuration. In Malmo Role (1984), a four-foot-square steel plate, one and a half inches thick, bisects {{a corner of the room}} and is prevented from falling by a short cylindrical prop wedged into the corner of the walls.|$|E
2500|$|The floor {{would have}} a similar {{configuration}} as the Great Hall {{with a set of}} double pulpits and pews, but the room was never completed. [...] Doors were never hung, the plastering was unfinished, and the floorboards were only <b>rough</b> <b>timber,</b> not the tongue and grove finished hardwoods of the other floors. The room, when used for an occasional meeting, was furnished with wooden benches.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} {{also that}} the hall called Aar was a long house roofed with sods, on which grew grass and sometimes little white flowers, and that inside of it cows were tied up. We lived in a place beyond, that was separated off from the cows by balks of <b>rough</b> <b>timber.</b> I used to watch them being milked through a crack {{between two of the}} balks where a knot had fallen out, leaving a convenient eyehole about the height of a walking-stick from the floor.|$|E
5000|$|The Bronze Age Trackway was {{discovered}} in 1972 after findings from Turner's [...] pollen analysis evidenced small temporary wood clearance during the Bronze Age warranted investigation. The investigation revealed <b>rough</b> <b>timbers</b> of various sizes placed side by side to create a trackway. It is thought the trackway was created during primary phase forest clearance and {{in part due to}} the contemporary widespread flooding of the local area.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} first envisaged by six like-minded school boys {{who wanted to}} save the light railway {{equipment}} which was disappearing from local industries. The first problem was finding a suitable site, this was solved when a strip of land above the clay pits at Alty's Brickworks. In 1967 the group of six started laying track using rails from the former clay tramways and <b>rough</b> <b>timbers</b> as sleepers.|$|R

6000|$|He peered and listened, but saw nothing, heard nothing. After a {{while the}} solid {{blackness}} seemed to wave before his eyes like a curtain disclosing movements but hiding forms, and he heard light and hurried footsteps, then the short clatter of the gate leading to Lakamba's private enclosure. He sprang forward and brought up against the <b>rough</b> <b>timber</b> in time to hear the words, [...] "Quick! Quick!" [...] {{and the sound of}} the wooden bar dropped on the other side, securing the gate. With his arms thrown up, the palms against the paling, he slid down in a heap on the ground.|$|E
6000|$|She {{was unable}} to make a sound.--"Are you there?" [...] Lingard asked, anxiously, so close to her now that she seemed to feel the very breath of his words on her face. It revived her completely; she {{understood}} {{what she had to}} do. She put her head and shoulders through the opening, was at once seized under the arms by an eager grip and felt herself pulled through with an irresistible force and with such haste that her scarf was dragged off her head, its fringes having caught in the <b>rough</b> <b>timber.</b> The same eager grip lifted her up, stood her on her feet without her having to make any exertion toward that end. She became aware that Lingard was trying to say something, but she heard only a confused stammering expressive of wonder and delight in which she caught the words [...] "You [...] . you [...] ." [...] deliriously repeated. He didn't release his hold of her; his helpful and irresistible grip had changed into a close clasp, a crushing embrace, the violent taking possession by an embodied force that had broken loose and was not to be controlled any longer. As his great voice had done a moment before, his great strength, too, seemed able to fill all space in its enveloping and undeniable authority. Every time she tried instinctively to stiffen herself against its might, it reacted, affirming its fierce will, its uplifting power. Several times she lost the feeling of the ground and had a sensation of helplessness without fear, of triumph without exultation. The inevitable had come to pass. She had foreseen it--and all the time in that dark place and against the red glow of camp fires within the stockade the man in whose arms she struggled remained shadowy to her eyes--to her half-closed eyes. She thought suddenly, [...] "He will crush me to death without knowing it." ...|$|E
60|$|During {{this little}} interruption, you {{perceive}} that the Anglo-Saxon energy--as the phrase now goes--has {{been at work}} in the spectacle before us. So many chimneys now send up their smoke, that it begins to have the aspect of a village street; although everything is so inartificial and inceptive, that it seems as if one returning wave of the wild nature might overwhelm it all. But the one edifice which gives the pledge of permanence to this bold enterprise is seen at the central point of the picture. There stands the meeting-house, a small structure, low-roofed, without a spire, and built of <b>rough</b> <b>timber,</b> newly hewn, with the sap still in the logs, and here and there a strip of bark adhering to them. A meaner temple was never consecrated to the worship of the Deity. With the alternative of kneeling beneath the awful vault of the firmament, it is strange that men should creep into this pent-up nook, and expect God's presence there. Such, at least, one would imagine, might be the feeling of these forest-settlers, accustomed, as they had been, to stand under the dim arches of vast cathedrals, and to offer up their hereditary worship in the old ivy-covered churches of rural England, around which lay the bones of many generations of their forefathers. How could they dispense with the carved altar-work?--how, with the pictured windows, where the light of common day was hallowed by being transmitted through the glorified figures of saints?--how, with the lofty roof, imbued, as it must have been, with the prayers that had gone upward for centuries?--how, with the rich peal of the solemn organ, rolling along the aisles, pervading the whole church, and sweeping the soul away on a flood of audible religion? They needed nothing of all this. Their house of worship, like their ceremonial, was naked, simple, and severe. But the zeal of a recovered faith burned like a lamp within their hearts, enriching everything around them with its radiance; making of these new walls, and this narrow compass, its own cathedral; and being, in itself, that spiritual mystery and experience, of which sacred architecture, pictured windows, and the organ's grand solemnity are remote and imperfect symbols. All was well, so long as their lamps were freshly kindled at heavenly flame. After a while, however, whether in their time or their children's, these lamps began to burn more dimly, or with a less genuine lustre; and then it might be seen how hard, cold, and confined was their system,--how like an iron cage was that which they called Liberty.|$|E
60|$|Towards daybreak, we came {{among the}} snow, where a keen {{wind was blowing}} fiercely. Having, with some trouble, awakened the inmates of a wooden house in this solitude: round which the wind was howling dismally, {{catching}} up the snow in wreaths and hurling it away: we got some breakfast in a room built of <b>rough</b> <b>timbers,</b> but well warmed by a stove, and well contrived (as it had need to be) for keeping out the bitter storms. A sledge being then made ready, and four horses harnessed to it, we went, ploughing, through the snow. Still upward, but now in the cold light of morning, and with the great white desert on which we travelled, plain and clear.|$|R
60|$|Feeling that {{it would}} be {{impossible}} to exist much longer unless he could get quite out of the water so as to allow the sun to warm his chilled frame, he used what strength remained in him to drag towards him several spars that lay within his reach. These he found to be some of the <b>rough</b> <b>timbers</b> that had lain on the deck of the cutter to serve as spare masts and yards. They were, therefore, destitute of cordage, so that it was not possible to form a secure raft. Nevertheless, by piling them together on the top of the broken portion of the deck, he succeeded in constructing a platform which raised him completely out of the water.|$|R
5000|$|Strathmore has an {{extensive}} network of cattle yards constructed of <b>rough</b> bush <b>timber</b> that are {{west of the}} buildings within the homestead complex. Recently part of the yards were dismantled and relocated to the central business district of Bowen {{for inclusion in the}} movie set for the film [...] "Australia".|$|R
50|$|Located {{between the}} trolley shed and the {{platform}} of Spring Bluff, a wide drain with rendered stone walls passes underneath the track. Sitting above the drain is a <b>rough</b> <b>timber</b> beam {{and a small}} leaning timber guardrail.|$|E
50|$|Building trades such as {{plumbing}} and carpentry often use imperial units. <b>Rough</b> <b>timber,</b> drywall, plywood, fasteners, pipes, and tubing are all sold in imperial units. Nails in hardware stores are measured in inches but sold in metric weight packages.|$|E
50|$|Bridges {{are another}} common {{feature of the}} Chinese garden. Like the galleries, they are rarely straight, but zigzag or arch over the ponds, {{suggesting}} the bridges of rural China, and providing view points of the garden. Bridges are often built from <b>rough</b> <b>timber</b> or stone-slab raised pathways. Some gardens have brightly painted or lacquered bridges, which give a lighthearted feeling to the garden.|$|E

The four {{men and a}} dog sit under a large {{thatched}} structure supported by <b>rough</b> hewn <b>timbers.</b> The men wear long-sleeved shirts, pants, and bandanas. A saddle is visible at right, while bridles can be seen hanging nearby at left. A wooden post and rail corral is visible behind the group...|$|R
5000|$|Mining {{includes}} gold at Redwing Mine, Penhalonga {{and some}} smaller mines, diamonds in Marange and gravel quarries around the city. There {{are a number}} of forestry companies including The Wattle Company, Allied Timbers formerly FCZ,Border Timbers and Timcon Investments [...]The main <b>timber</b> products include <b>rough</b> sawn <b>timber,</b> wattle bark, charcoal, various doors and frames and mouldings. The major timber produced is pine, sydney blue gum, black wattle, and some hardwoods on a smaller scale.|$|R
50|$|FKA {{buildings}} are distinctive, often very masculine and sculptural, they also feature {{a variety of}} materials and textures such as exposed steel, left to the weather, or <b>rough</b> hewn <b>timber.</b> An early FKA project involved the conversion of former grain silos in Richmond, a Melbourne suburb, into distinctive apartments featuring balconies resembling a ship's bow. FKA also designed Eureka Tower completed in June 2006 in Southbank, which has become Melbourne's tallest building {{and one of the}} tallest residential buildings in the world.|$|R
50|$|Both {{buildings}} are raised on low stumps, {{some of which}} have ant caps, and flooring laid on a <b>rough</b> <b>timber</b> frame, rather than an earthen floor. It would appear to be an early example of this technique. Horizontal slabs of split timber have been used to construct the walls and the hipped roof and skillions over the verandahs are of corrugated iron.|$|E
50|$|The floor {{would have}} a similar {{configuration}} as the Great Hall {{with a set of}} double pulpits and pews, but the room was never completed. Doors were never hung, the plastering was unfinished, and the floorboards were only <b>rough</b> <b>timber,</b> not the tongue and grove finished hardwoods of the other floors. The room, when used for an occasional meeting, was furnished with wooden benches.|$|E
5000|$|We {{have this}} {{wonderful}} store of folk music—the melodies of an enslaved people ... But this store {{will be of}} no value unless we utilize it, unless we treat it in such manner {{that it can be}} presented in choral form, in lyric and operatic works, in concertos and suites and salon music—unless our musical architects take the <b>rough</b> <b>timber</b> of Negro themes and fashion from it music which will prove that we, too, have national feelings and characteristics, as have the European peoples whose forms we have zealously followed for so long.|$|E
40|$|This work {{analyses}} Spanish {{imports of}} <b>rough</b> and manufactured <b>timber</b> between 1880 and 1935. We start {{by measuring the}} percentage of both over Spanish wood consumption, showing {{the continuity of the}} former and the fall of the latter. Then an annual series of tariffs applicable to these products is built in order to estimate, through two different econometric models, protection effects on import evolution. According to our results, these effects were moderate. The different behaviour of <b>rough</b> and manufactured <b>timber,</b> therefore, may be explained by differences in their competitiveness, which is related to Spanish timber resources and to the integration of the domestic timber market.

40|$|Photograph of a {{reconstruction}} by Dr. Palmer of a prehistoric Indian house {{and place of}} worship, California, ca. 1900 - 1930. A ring of stones layed out on the beach surround two short wooden posts flanking another oblong stone. The posts have symbols written on them. A cone of <b>rough</b> wood <b>timbers</b> stands nearby. Adjacent to the cone of timbers is dome of earth with an opening. Two canoes and a paddle lay on the sand nearby. Sundry camp and cooking implements are also present. The ocean is visible in the background...|$|R
50|$|To {{the west}} of this are the milking yards, {{comprising}} a milking shed and remnants of a simple timber post and rail fence. The shed has an L-shaped plan, enclosed on the western end with the extending wing open {{to the north and}} framed with wide <b>timber</b> <b>rough</b> cut sections.|$|R
50|$|Wood of most firs is {{considered}} unsuitable for general timber use, {{and is often}} used as pulp or for the manufacture of plywood and <b>rough</b> <b>timber.</b> Because this genus has no insect or decay resistance qualities after logging, it is generally recommended for construction purposes as indoor use only (e.g. indoor drywall on framing). This wood left outside cannot be expected to last more than 12 to 18 months, {{depending on the type}} of climate it is exposed to. It is commonly referred to by several different names, including North American timber, SPF (spruce, pine, fir) and whitewood.|$|E
5000|$|The {{village was}} built in {{connection}} with the Forth or Oakley Iron-works (1846), now all gone along with the colliery industry. The iron-works, which ceased production many years ago, had six furnaces, with stacks 180 ft high, and the engine-house was built with walls to comprise [...] of stone {{below the surface of the}} ground. Subsequent to the Iron Works the buildings were used as a sawmill producing <b>rough</b> <b>timber</b> for railway sleepers, fence posts and the like. Comrie Colliery closed in 1986, and the village took many years to recover from this major employer's demise.|$|E
50|$|The colonists {{arrived at}} a good {{time of the year}} to begin {{cultivation}} wherever the ground was cleared of timber, and within the first six weeks most of them had started their gardens. It was too late to sow grain, but they got their potatoes in, and sowed their vegetable seeds. Lavaud started at French Farm a larger garden to supply the needs of his crew. The colonists built their first rough huts, either of <b>rough</b> <b>timber,</b> or of wattle-and-daub. The spiritual needs of the settlement were cared for by the priests of the Catholic Mission, Fathers Comte and Tripe, one ministering to Maori and the other to Europeans.|$|E
50|$|Internal framing is {{provided}} by substantial timber columns, bearers and joists, with ceilings lined with galvanised ripple iron {{to the ground and}} first floors. Steel box beams are also used in some areas to increase clear spans. Flooring consists of <b>rough</b> sawn <b>timber</b> boards, some areas of which have been sheeted over, and piers to the basement and sub-floor are masonry. The roof has timber framed trusses with bolted connections, forming a saw-tooth profile, with glass louvred clerestory windows. Ceilings are lined on the rake with beaded tongue and groove boarding, and the roof is sheeted with corrugated iron.|$|R
60|$|Within {{the house}} a wood-fire burned in the sun, its smoke {{ascending}} to the roof, and flowing thence through a rude chimney. A pot steamed over the fire, burdening {{the air with a}} savour at first somewhat faint and disgusting,--perhaps because it was merely strange to me. The walls of this lofty room were of <b>rough,</b> substantial <b>timber,</b> bare and weatherproof; the floor was of the colour of earth, seemingly earth itself. A few rude stools, a bench, and a four-legged table stood beside the unshuttered window. And from this stretched the beauteous green of the grass-land or prairie beyond the stockade.|$|R
60|$|The {{southern}} {{shore of}} Lake Ontario is to-day dotted with villages and towns, but when General Prideaux's army sailed along this coast it showed an almost unbroken front of gigantic <b>timber,</b> <b>rough</b> rocks and stretches of sandy waste. Here {{and there was}} an Indian village, but the warriors were away, either with the French or the English.|$|R
50|$|The grain shed {{is located}} about 15m to the {{south-west}} of the blacksmith's. It was originally used to store grain in bulk; {{however it is}} now used as a theatre. It has a low-pitched gable roof and sits on low timber stumps. The walls are clad in weatherboards and the awning windows are made of timber boards. Entry is gained via a short flight of timber stairs on the north-eastern facade. Inside the floor is lined with timber tongue-and-groove boards. The seating {{was provided by the}} Princess Cinema in Mount Gravatt, Brisbane. Adjacent to the north-west of this building is an open gable-roofed barn supported by <b>rough</b> <b>timber</b> poles.|$|E
50|$|Located {{underneath}} the platform at Spring Bluff between the station building {{and a large}} clump of bamboo is a stone culvert. The culvert is arched, with stone wing walls, deck and abutments. Internally the arch and floor of the causeway is lined with cut and dressed stone. At {{the entrance of the}} culvert are stone retaining walls. There is stonework above the abutments and timber beams attached to the platform sit above the entrance. A circular pipe draining from the station building is placed in a retaining wall of stone {{to the right of the}} culvert. Located among the gardens below the residences, a wide winding waterway, lined with sections of large rock and stone retaining walls, empties to a large circular concrete pipe, continuing {{underneath the}} track. Located below the Fettler's quarters is the entrance to a small drain, with stone walls and <b>rough</b> <b>timber</b> decking.|$|E
5000|$|To combat an {{apparent}} problem with people throwing coal ashes into the street, the act also required {{every person in}} London, Westminster, Southwark and surrounding suburbs to sweep the area {{in front of their}} house [...] "... every Wednesday and every Saturday in the Weeke". The act also prohibited the hooping of barrels and sawing of stones or <b>rough</b> <b>timber</b> in the streets. Rakers and scavengers were to use [...] "... a Bell Horne Clapper or otherwise and shall make distinct and loud noise and give notice to the Inhabitants of theire coming ..." [...] so [...] "... that all persons concerned may bring forth theire respective Ashes Dust Dirt Filth and Soil to the respective Carts or Carriages". These scavengers were to be elected according to existing customs, and within 20 days rubbish collection rates (to be paid quarterly) were to be set by churchwardens and other leaders of the parish.|$|E
50|$|Another cottage is east of {{the slab}} hut. It is a timber-framed {{building}} set on <b>rough</b> bush <b>timber</b> stumps. The core of the cottage is single-skin with exposed studs and has a hipped roofline with guttering. Some of the interior walls are lined with wide v-jointed tongue and groove boarding and the ceiling is lined with fibrous cement sheeting with cover battens. Additions {{to the core of}} the cottage are of timber framing clad with fibrous cement sheeting to the front, and fibrous cement sheeting and ripple iron to the rear and louvred windows. Elevated on steel posts the building has a partially enclosed patio on the east side with timber and steel framing set on concrete flooring. The west side has been sheeted with ripple iron.|$|R
50|$|This {{structure}} is sited approximately seven to ten metres further east {{from the office}} and bookkeeper's quarters described above. Rectangular in plan, it has a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron, the ridge of which runs from east to west. Its wall and roof framing members are made from <b>rough</b> hewn <b>timber</b> posts, in between which have been inserted some sections of vertical adzed timber slabs and some of corrugated iron. Its northern elevation is entirely open, with only the timber posts visible, while the short sides facing east and west are partly filled. The elevation facing south is entirely filled with timber slab and corrugated iron panels. The whole {{structure is}} leaning heavily. A Banyan Tree (Ficus bengalensis) stands adjacent to the south-eastern of this structure.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 the World Trade Organization {{estimated}} that the mining sector accounted for about 7% {{of the gross domestic}} product. <b>Rough</b> diamonds and <b>timber</b> were the country's leading export products.However, in December 2014, the U.S. Department of Labor report on labor conditions around the world contained a List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor that mentioned diamonds as a good produced in such working conditions in the Central African Republic.|$|R
