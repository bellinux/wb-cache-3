40|$|It is {{important}} to have an understanding of the population genetics and validity of the pertinent underlying assumptions of a species in order to design an effective breeding strategy. In a South African breeding population of Eucalyptus nitens, various scenarios investigating a range of assumptions were developed and used to predict genetic gain in the F 2. These were compared with <b>realised</b> <b>gains</b> achieved in a series of genetic gain trials. In the two scenarios using firstly, actual flowering for family (provenance) and, secondly, estimated flowering after 30 % roguing of poor families, a coefficient of relationship of 0. 33 resulted in predictions closest to realised gain, on average. The statistical information suggested that outcrossing in the seed orchards was[80 %. Indications were that the effects were additive, and that very little or no heterosis had occurred, due to the still significant provenance effects and the lack of provenance rank changes in the F 2. The custom of assuming a degree of inbreeding (and using a coefficient of relationship of 0. 33) and of including provenance effects in the models, on average resulted in genetic gain predictions which were very similar to the realised genetic gains in this population of E. nitens.

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} expenditure {{and investment in}} information technology (IT) {{has been accompanied by}} an increasing demand to measure the business value of IT. The impact of IT on improving the productivity and performance of organisations has been varied. While some organisations have <b>realised</b> <b>gains,</b> other organisations have found the business value of IT to be elusive. In most organisations a large portion of senior management’s time is being spent on finding methods to measure the contribution of the organisations’ IT investments to business performance. IT investments in organisations are huge and increasing rapidly year on year and yet {{there is a lack of}} understanding of the impact of proper IT investment evaluation processes and practices in these organisations. This is applicable to South Africa and thus one can argue that a detailed program of research into the current practice and process of the business value of IT in South Africa is warranted. This masters dissertation which, has evolved from IT evaluation literature, is to highlight the differences between IT literature and what occurs in practice. The research objective utilised an existing questionnaire which was sent to large South African organisations to assess the understanding and activities performed by these organisations regarding the business value of IT.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an in depth analysis of investors’ reluctance to crystallise losses and propensity to <b>realise</b> <b>gains,</b> a behavioural bias dubbed the disposition effect. We examine a comprehensive data set comprised of trading records for individual and institutional investors within the Finnish Stock Market over an extensive ten year period. Consistent with previous studies, {{we find that}} the disposition effect exists for not only individuals, but also for institutions. We conclude that despite significantly attenuating, ‘professionalism’ (i. e. investor sophistication) is unable to provide total immunity from the disposition bias. Moreover, this study confirms the existence of an apparent asymmetric relationship between trading experience and the disposition effect. Both individuals and institutions exhibit learning effects over time, with the accumulation of trading experience inversely related to the bias. However, while investors are capable of completely eliminating their tendency to ride losses, we found that no amount of trading experience is capable of eradicating an investor’s propensity to <b>realise</b> <b>gains...</b>|$|R

40|$|Two {{series of}} {{realised}} genetic gain tests of large plots, one for black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B. S. P.) {{and one for}} white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss), were established in the early 1990 s in New Brunswick, Canada, to investigate <b>realised</b> <b>gains</b> from planting improved seedlots representing early-stage tree improvement activities. Individual-tree growth was recorded up to age 15 (one-quarter of their rotation age). Four improved seedlots {{were included in the}} black spruce gain test. Planting the superior stand seedlot (CAN 101) could obtain moderate gain (7. 0 % in volume/tree and 3. 5 % in volume/ha at age 15). Growth improvement for the seedlot (UNROG) collected from a seedling seed orchard (FRA_SSO) established using phenotypically selected plus trees was negligible but genetic roguing improved the FRA_SSO seedlot’s growth, resulting in 3. 3 and 2. 1 % increase in 15 -yr volume per tree and per hectare, respectively. The highest gain was observed by deploying the elite half-sib family (01 - 15), which resulted in a gain of 27. 6 % in 15 -yr volume/ha. Three improved seedlots were included in the white spruce realised-gain test. The seedlot (OVSSO) collected from a provenance seedling seed orchard had 9. 2 % more volume/ha at age 15 years. Much higher gains were observed in the seedlots collected from an unrogued clonal seed orchard (DNR_CSO). Mixed cone collections from the DNR_CSO achieved 25. 6 % more volume/ha at age 15 than the unimproved seedlot.

40|$|Companies {{surviving}} the 1980 s world recession have needed regularly to manage change {{in order to}} compete effectively in turbulent and often global markets. Frequently, such change has challenged the existing organization and the system of industrial relations. Today, there is considerable {{evidence to suggest that}} the more successful companies operate with more contingent forms of organization. Such forms of organization have few layers, encourage empowerment, multiskilling and job enrichment and incorporate a wide range of Japanese manufacturing techniques and personnel systems. The impact of these changes on working practices, together with continuing high unemployment and a marked decline in union membership and influence, have influenced a move from industrial relations towards human resource management approaches. This transformation has been accelerated as businesses have both <b>realised</b> <b>gains</b> and experienced further recession in the early 1990 s. This case study examines how a steel company managed a complex cultural and structural change programme. Change commenced in the 1980 s recession when benchmarking activities suggested that more successful steel companies invested in both capital and people. Since then, the company has invested in people through numerous programmes including continuous training, vocational education qualifications, job flexibility and mobility, delayering, standard and target setting, appraisal, performance pay to recognise individual behaviour and contribution, and management training to improve leadership and the company's ability to manage change. By 1988, the company had adopted an HRM approach. In 1992, the senior management introduced a 'harder' form of HRM by establishing a fully single status company and derecognizing the four trade unions. The company has become an exemplar of HRM.

40|$|Clonal forestry, the {{establishment}} of plantations using tested clones, is highly sought after by the forestry industry in New Zealand and worldwide. Clonal testing is a vital element in the process leading to clonal forestry. Two clonal trials established in 1986 and 1987 by the Forest Research Institute with juvenile ortet material have been analysed in this study. The mating design in the 1986 clones-in-family trial was single-pair crossing with amplification of the clones by fascicle cuttings. It was replicated over two sites, and the trait analysed was diameter at 1. 40 m height at ages 4, 7, and 10 years. The estimation of additive, non-additive and genetic variances showed {{a high proportion of}} non-additive variance compared with the additive variance at one of the sites, whereas the proportion was less important at the other site. The high non-additive component of variance can be due to important dominance or epistasis, or to C-effects confounded with the non-additive variance. This trend was similar for all three ages. Realised genetic gains were obtained from selection of clones at age 10 years for clonal deployment and breeding. For clonal deployment, <b>realised</b> <b>gains</b> were high at both sites (13 % and 16 %). The gains were similar at both sites provided selection was based on performance values at the site, and not on indirect selection on performance of clones at the other site. <b>Realised</b> <b>gains</b> for selection at age 10 based on the performance of clones on combined sites (10 % and 13 %) were less than the maximum gain obtained at each individual site. Gains based on information from both sites (10 % and 12 % at respective sites) were more stable than those selections at any one site. For breeding, the level of gain was significantly inferior than for clonal deployment (4 % and 8 %), especially when the number of clones per family was restricted to one (2 % and 4 %). Realised gain on combined-site selection yielded less gain than direct selection at the optimum site for selection (1 % and 2 %). The presence of genotype x environment interaction emphasised the need to test clones in several sites if stability of performance is desired. It is possible to obtain gain from selections made at an early age, but selections made for breeding at the age of final assessment yielded greater expected total gain and gain per unit time. The mating design in the 1987 clones-in-family trial was a 3 x 3 disconnected factorial. The trial was established on a single site and the trait analysed was percentage of Dothistroma needle infection at ages 3, 4 and 7 years. The mating design allowed estimation of additive, dominance and epistasis variances, which were overestimated for the lack of replication over sites. In this trial measured for Dothistroma resistance, the additive variance was the major component of the genetic variance at both ages. The evolution of components of genetic variance was confounded with the level of Dothistroma infection. The analysis of these trials indicated the need to improve the mating and field designs to improve the accuracy in the estimation of genetic parameters, highlights the importance of annual or biennual measurements to determine trends of those parameters over time, and showed the difference in gains obtained from selection for breeding and clonal deployment for early selection and selection at the age of final assessment. Accuracy in the estimation of genetic parameters can be achieved using factorial mating designs together with serial propagation to reduce the incidence of C effects, and with replication over several sites. Further considerations have to be made to find the most appropriate field and statistical design, but alpha designs are a possibility to explore. Investment in a series of carefully planned clonal trials is fundamental to the future of clonal forestry in radiata pine...|$|E

Furthermore, the paper assesses the financial strength of the ECB. As monetary policy operations are normally conducted by national central banks under the impulse and instructions from the ECB, the Eurosystem balance sheet is the primary reference for the analysis of Eurosystem monetary policy operations. Three main drivers of the balance sheet and {{profit and loss account}} are identified. Firstly, financial market developments and portfolio management decisions imply changes {{in the value of the}} foreign reserve and own funds portfolios, which represent a substantial part of the balance sheet (with the share of own funds becoming increasingly larger over the period under review). At the same time, the profit and loss account depends to an important degree on interest income and expenses, <b>realised</b> <b>gains</b> and losses, and write-downs on these portfolios. Secondly, strong banknote demand has gradually increased the size of the balance sheet since the euro changeover in 2002. Banknotes in circulation also provide a strong base for seigniorage income, which is an important item of the profit and loss account. Thirdly, the liquidity-providing operations in foreign currency, which the Eurosystem has undertaken since 2007 in response to the fi nancial crisis, increased significantly the size of the ECB 2 ̆ 019 s (and the Eurosystem 2 ̆ 019 s) balance sheet. In terms of income and expenses, these operations were rather immaterial at the level of the ECB, although the income generated was substantial at the Eurosystem level. The ECB has remained financially strong over the 11 -year period. Factors that support the financial position are strong legislative provisions on e. g. independence and income, the use of financial buffers, seigniorage as a reliable income source and an effective loss-coverage mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Breeding of Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex Benth in Vietnam, which {{commenced}} in 1996, {{has focused}} {{to date on}} improving tree growth and stem straightness. Little {{attention has been paid}} to important properties of wood such as basic density, shrinkage, bending stiffness and strength, which determine suitability for specific end-use applications. The aim of the studies reported here was to obtain knowledge of genetic factors associated with wood traits and their relationships with growth and tree form, in order to facilitate improvement of A. auriculiformis for sawn timber production. Empirical data were gathered in a progeny test, three clonal tests and three genetic gain tests in four provinces of Vietnam. Genetic parameters for the studied traits were estimated at ages ranging from 3 to 9 years. The results showed that individual within-provenance heritabilities (h 2) and clonal repeatabilities (H 2) for growth, stem straightness, basic density and shrinkage increased with age, but those for mechanical properties were stable with age. In the progeny test, h 2 ranged from 0. 36 to 0. 39 for growth traits, 0. 40 - 0. 61 for density and 0. 12 – 0. 31 for stem straightness. In clonal tests, H 2 ranged from 0. 21 to 0. 56 for growth traits, 0. 16 - 0. 38 for shrinkage traits, and 0. 21 - 0. 57 for mechanical properties. Growth and wood properties had coefficients of additive genetic variation (CVA) and genotypic variation (CVG) ranging from 5 - 12 %. High age-age correlations for most studied traits were found, suggesting that there would be more gain per unit time by selecting trees at 3 to 4 years old than at greater ages. Growth traits showed consistent positive genetic correlations with stem straightness, but non-significant correlations with wood properties, except for a significant negative correlation between diameter and stiffness. Genotype by environment interaction was important for growth and stem straightness in clone trials across southern, central-north and northern Vietnam, but not important for a number of improved and unimproved seedlots compared in genetic gain trials across northern, central-north and central Vietnam. Predicted and <b>realised</b> <b>gains</b> for growth were substantial for seed orchard seedlots produced by the current breeding program, compared with natural-provenance and local commercial control seedlots. Good gains in growth and form traits and wood properties could be obtained from clonal selection, although the absence of strong, favourable correlations between growth and wood properties indicates that gains for individual traits would be reduced if a multi-trait improvement approach was adopted. The findings clearly demonstrate that there is potential to improve tree growth, stem straightness, wood density, shrinkage and mechanical properties of A. auriculiformis in Vietnam...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundWe {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that optimum-contribution selection (OCS) with restrictions imposed during optimisation realises most of the long-term genetic <b>gain</b> <b>realised</b> by OCS without restrictions. MethodsWe used stochastic simulation to estimate long-term rates of genetic <b>gain</b> <b>realised</b> by breeding schemes that applied OCS without and with restrictions imposed during optimisation, where long-term refers to generations 23 to 25 (approximately). Six restrictions were imposed. Five of these removed solutions from the solution space. The sixth removed records of selection decisions made at earlier selection times. We also simulated a conventional breeding scheme with truncation selection as a reference point. Generations overlapped, selection was for a single trait, and the trait was observed for all selection candidates prior to selection. ResultsOCS with restrictions realised 67 to 99 % of the additional <b>gain</b> <b>realised</b> by OCS without restrictions, where additional gain was {{the difference in the}} long-term rates of genetic <b>gain</b> <b>realised</b> by OCS without restrictions and our reference point with truncation selection. The only exceptions were those restrictions that removed all solutions near the optimum solution from the solution space and the restriction that removed records of selection decisions made at earlier selection times. Imposing these restrictions realised only − 12 to 46 % of the additional gain. ConclusionsMost of the long-term genetic <b>gain</b> <b>realised</b> by OCS without restrictions can be realised by OCS with restrictions imposed during optimisation, provided the restrictions do not remove all solutions near the optimum from the solution space and do not remove records of earlier selection decisions. In breeding schemes where OCS cannot be applied optimally because of biological and logistical restrictions, OCS with restrictions provides a useful alternative. Not only does it realise most of the long-term genetic gain, OCS with restrictions enables OCS to be tailored to individual breeding schemes...|$|R

40|$|A {{cost-saving}} invention may so enhance a firm's {{market power}} that output price rises. The private return to R&D may then exceed the <b>realised</b> social <b>gain.</b> These possibilities arise when integer constraints {{are important in}} determining industry size. If economies of scale are exhausted at sufficiently low outputs for free entry {{to result in a}} zero-profit equilibrium, small inventions leave output price unchanged. This mirrors Arrow's perfectly competitive model. But under oligopoly both fixed fees and (possibly negative) royalties are used by an inventor in earning a return which may exceed the potential social gain...|$|R
40|$|By using a Malmquist {{total factor}} {{productivity}} index and data envelopment analysis {{it is possible to}} investigate the efficiency and productivity of Australian airports during the 1990 s. The results from this analysis indicate that these airports recorded strong growth in technological change and {{total factor productivity}}, but did not fare all that well in terms of growth in technical and scale efficiency during the 1990 s. At the international level it appears that Australia's largest airports fare reasonably well in comparison to airports overseas, although they still possess the potential to <b>realise</b> further <b>gains...</b>|$|R
