The screenshot shows Alan Wake in a different attire, with a flannel shirt and jeans, next to a road sign that says the town of Night Springs is 15 miles away. Night Springs is a fictional television show in Alan Wake, and is the setting of said show. On 10 November, a short teaser trailer was unveiled. During {{the days leading up}} to the publication of the first screenshot, Remedy employees made a number of comments on the official Alan Wake community forums about the new game. It was shared that the new title is [...] "structured like a full <b>release</b> <b>complete</b> with a pretty damn impressive storyline that expands the originals in some interesting ways." [...] Although no specifics were revealed, Remedy responded to fans who were worried that being an Xbox Live Arcade game meant that the amount of content in the game would be too small. Remedy claimed that there will definitely be enough [...] "value for money" [...] for the players of the game, and that fans [...] "will be blown away by the proportion of things pretty soon".|$|E

Aside from numerous previously released pieces, Word Virus also included what was promoted {{as one of the}} few surviving fragments of And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks, a novel by Burroughs and Kerouac (later published in 2008). A collection of journal entries written during the final months of Burroughs's life was published as the book Last Words in 2000.
