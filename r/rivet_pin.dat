40|$|A {{simulation}} of tolerance analysis in assemblies using Sigmund Computer Aided Tolerancing (CAT) software is validated through {{the example of}} an automobile locking device. Simulation with CAT, applying criteria on both the statistical distribution and the <b>rivet</b> <b>pin</b> position in the hole used in the example, {{will allow us to}} predict the functional dimension tolerances in these assemblies with greater accuracy in the preliminary design phase. These tolerances will subsequently define the manufacturing specifications. The statistical distribution, in the example, that best fits the overall set of tolerances, is the triangular distribution followed by the normal distribution; the position of the <b>rivet</b> <b>pin</b> axis in its hole is off-centre by 53 % with regard to its maximum value...|$|E
40|$|For the {{dismantling}} of austenitic components of nuclear facilities fastening techniques, usable remote controlled under water, are investigated. The components are only one-sided accessable. The fastening techniques are based on Drawn Arc Stud Welding, Mechanical Drilling followed by mechanical clamping of the fastening elements and thermal drilling with Contact Arc Metal Cutting (CAMC) followed by mechanical clamping of the fastening elements. In thermal drilling process with CAMC hollow electrodes of different materials with internal water scavenging are investigated with regard to wear behaviour and removal rate. The graphite type EG 88 shows the longest electrode life, tested in plates of thickness from 20 mm up to 65 mm and using dielectric fluid both drinking water and deionized water. 14 holes were drilled in a plate of a thickness of 30 mm (adequate to 420 mm) without electrode-changing, in this time the wear on the length 16, 9 mm. Minor tapered holes and rough interior surfaces of the pearcing holes are the results. Fastening elements plug and blind rivet, which are customary in trade, have been investigated. The latter guarantees the necessary mould clamp. The selected blind rivet is usable for plate-thicknesses from 6 mm up to 42 mm. In tensile test the <b>rivet</b> <b>pin</b> breaks from 78 kN upwards. The rivet case is formed in minor tapered holes {{in the same way}} as in rough interior surfaces of holes. Drill bur does not influence the results. The developed combined one-way fastening elements and repeatedly applicable fastening elements are able to pierce (CAMC), to interlock and also to fix and to transport the segments of the components without changing end effector of the manipulator. Such a general ideal process is demonstrated in 1 : 1 experiment. The developed fastening technologies are usable at least up to a water depth of 20 m.

50|$|The {{rocket motor}} of PL-4 is {{designated}} as FG101, and {{is shared by}} another anti-radar derivative named Fenglei-7 (风雷7号). The revival of PL-4 was partially due to the decision to develop the anti-radar derivative in January 1979. The designer of the rocket motor was Harbin Ship Engineering Academy (哈尔滨船舶工程学院), the predecessor of Harbin Engineering University, 349th Factory was tasked to manufacture the propellant, 845th Factory was tasked for ground test, and 331st Factory was tasked for final integration. During the propulsion development, the contractor and subcontractors developed new manufacturing techniques, including improvements in installation, new <b>rivet</b> <b>pins,</b> graphite exhaust nozzle, and tolerance. A brand new heat processing method for integrated spin forming was adopted to achieve the high precision engine components, and this was achieved via {{the use of a}} special spin forming machinery set specially developed by the Beijing Nonferrous Metal Research Academy (北京有色金属研究院). Once the bottleneck of propulsion has been overcame, both programs went forward with ease, and but the conclusion of political turmoil, namely, the end of Cultural Revolution was an even more crucial contribution in the later development.|$|R

50|$|The fibula is a {{multilayered}} structure. Its face {{consists of}} a very thin fire gilded and contoured silver disc, having a diameter of 58 mm. This is fixed by three silver <b>rivet</b> <b>pins</b> to an identically sized, 3 mm thick copper plate and together with this on a stronger silver plate. The rear plate, 78 mm in diameter, is significantly larger. On its rear, the pin was mounted. The reverse of the front plate {{was filled with a}} now whitish green mix of tin, lead and traces of copper in order to support the sensitive friction work and to prevent the pressing of the driven ornaments. But the tin components of the filler have damaged some of the metal parts of the decoration due to allotropic processes forced by low temperatures during long term storage in the soil (tin pest). The decoration {{consists of a}} quadrupedal animal walking to the right, with the animals head facing backwards. It has two ears and a protruding tongue. Around its neck it wears a collar shaped ornament. The legs are positioned under the body to accommodate the round shape of the disc. The background is decorated with irregularly distributed impressions, imitating a granulation. The scene is framed by two ribbed bands, which are enclosed by an ornamental wreath and another ribbed band. Around the body of the animal there are three rosette shaped rivet heads. The body of the animal has a large defect caused by the degenerated tin filling. Some of the protruding edges of the rear mounting plate are broken away. Beneath the copper plate, residual amounts of organic material were found, which were interpreted as ivory. Due to typological comparisons of the ornaments, the fibula was dated to circa 300 AD.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Poured-Lead" [...] Rivets {{which were}} used to affix the two wooden grips to the blade tang were unique to Ek Knives. Most knives at the time used {{standard}} cutlery <b>rivets</b> or <b>pins,</b> or they were simply driven onto the rat-tail tang. The Poured-Lead Rivets had the advantage that, if the grips ever became loose, they could be tightened in the field without any tools. All the owner {{needed to do was}} take a heavy object, such as a rock, and pound the lead rivets to tighten them. Another advantage of the Poured-Lead Rivets was the extra weight which made the knife balance far better than most, as it added weight to the hilt.

5000|$|Handle making {{can be done}} {{in several}} {{different}} ways depending on the tang of the knife. Full tang knives usually have handle scales either <b>pinned,</b> <b>riveted,</b> or screwed on to the tang itself while knives without a full tang may be inserted into a solid handle and then attached in one of the previously stated methods. Handle materials can range from natural materials including wood or elk horn to man-made materials like brass, plastic, polymer or micarta. A knife makers grinder may have additional attachments for making knife handles, such as small diameter contact wheels.|$|R

5000|$|The {{figure was}} {{loosely based on}} the artist's mannequins still {{available}} today; the basic figure had multiple points of articulation, previously not found in any children's toy. The advertising claimed [...] "21 points of articulation", however, if one actually counts each individual pivot contact point, there are 19; head-to-neck, neck-to-torso, shoulder-to-torso (2), biceps-to-shoulder (2), elbow (2), wrist (2), torso-to-pelvis, hipball-to-pelvis (2), thigh-to-pelvis (2), knee (2) and ankle (2).The figure was held together by means of elastic, wire hooks and metal <b>rivets.</b> Pivot <b>pins</b> were made of a ribbed plastic, which was pressed into the adjacent limb section, allowing the limbs to rotate as well as hinge at pivot point.

50|$|Use of the potters wheel became universal. The pottery {{associated}} with the Mauryan period consists of many types of ware. But the most highly developed technique is seen in a special type of pottery known as the Northern Black Polished Ware (NBP), which was {{the hallmark of the}} preceding and early Mauryan periods. The NBP ware is made of finely levigated alluvial clay, which when seen in section is usually of a grey and sometimes of a red hue. It has a brilliantly burnished dressing of the quality of a glaze which ranges from a jet black to a deep grey or a metallic steel blue. Occasionally small red-brown patches are apparent on the surface. It can be distinguished from other polished or graphite-coated red wares by its peculiar lustre and brilliance. This ware was used largely for dishes and small bowls. It is found in abundance in the Ganges valley. Although NBP was not very rare, it was obviously a more expensive ware than the other varieties, since potsherds of NBP were occasionally found <b>riveted</b> with copper <b>pins</b> indicating that even a cracked vessel in NBP ware had its value.|$|R
40|$|Many {{engineering}} {{parts in}} industries are assembled by <b>rivets,</b> bolts, <b>pins</b> etc. These joints {{are more vulnerable}} to fatigue loadings and a crack is emanated. As structure is in use crack starts propagating {{over a period of}} time. Crack propagation can be obstructed by inducing a compressive residual stress zone around the vulnerable parts. Cold expansion hole (CEH) is one of the techniques used to induce compressive stress zone, by inserting a tapered pin or a large diameter ball into an undersized hole. As the oversized object is inserted into the hole, the surrounding material is elastically deformed and when the object comes out from the other side, the expanded material springs back to form tangential compressive residual stress around the hole. In most of the cases the crack origins on the surface, a good surface finish is also an important parameter for increasing the strength at the surface and stop crack emanation. However, good surface finish is not achieved by CEH. A novel technique called rotating tool cold expansion (RTCE) technique is developed where a tapered mandrel is inserted into an undersized hole besides rotating it simultaneously. The tool rotation breaks down the coarse grains into fine grain structure achieving good surface finish. In this method, RTCE is performed with three undersized diameters, namely, 9. 2, 9. 5 and 9. 9 mm diameters to a maximum of 10 mm diameter. The tool material is high speed steel and the work piece material is commercial aluminium. The induced residual stresses are measured using X-ray diffraction method and compared for three different Cold expansion holes. Due to the rotation of the tool, heat is generated because of both friction at the interface and plastic deformation. A 3 -D thermo-mechanical analysis is performed in ANSYS FEA for different values of coefficient of friction and plastic deformation rate and validated with experimental results. Compared to the degree of cold expansion through conventional techniques (upto 4 %) the proposed technique is capable to produce good results up to 8. 69 % of cold expansion. Role of heat generated through friction and plastic deformation is critical to attain the best possible result, equal contributions of both are important...|$|R
40|$|Bolts, <b>rivets</b> and {{location}} <b>pins</b> {{are commonly used}} in various engineering applications for assembly of components and structures. The holes produced for the assembly is susceptible to cracks due to fatigue caused by tensile loads applied. These cracks can be prevented or its propagation can be prolonged by inducing compressive residual stress in the material around the hole. Cold expansion hole {{is one of the}} techniques used to induce compressive stress zone, by inserting a tapered mandrel/pin or ball into an undersized hole. A novel application of the cold expansion and surface modification of walls of the cylindrical hole is presented. Predrilled holes of different diameters in commercially available aluminum and Al- 2014 -T 6 aluminum alloy plates are cold expanded using a specially fabricated tapered tool that rotates and simultaneously traverses through the hole. The tapered tool expands the hole to the desired diameter and also stirs the internal wall of the hole. In order to understand the role of frictional heating and stirring in the cold expansion of holes three mediums, namely, dry (without cooling and lubricating), metal working fluid (cooling and lubricating) and Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles (lubricating and frictional heating) are used. The residual stress, surface roughness and hardness of the wall of the holes are measured and SEM images are captured. Significant residual stresses are induced in the material around the hole region. Significant hardness improvement with reasonable surface finish is obtained. Moreover the cold expanded holes showed considerable improvement in the fatigue life of the holes. The fatigue life is found to be directly proportional to residual stresses induced around the hole and inversely proportional to surface roughness. Hardness has a negative impact on fatigue life. The rotating tool cold expansion process is compared with conventional cold expansion process and good efficiency of cold expansion is achieved in case of Al- 2014 -T 6 aluminum alloy material using nanoparticles, in terms of fatigue life achieved. It is observed that frictional heating and the plastic deformation have combined effect on the performance of the cold expansion of cylindrical holes...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} a find assemblage {{that has}} been in the Drents Museum’s collection since December 1933. The finder, Arent Middelveld, had earlier that year offered the assemblage to the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden (National Museum of Antiquities) in Leiden, but that museum was not interested in it on account of its fragmentary state. Middelveld was a real treasure-hunter who was only interested in how much his finds would fetch him. There is however no reason whatsoever to doubt the reliability of the find’s source, which is reported to have been ‘Barger-Oosterveld’. Unfortunately, this is a vague description as this is a large area to the south, east and southeast of the town of Emmen. The finds recorded under number 1933 /XII 1 do not all belong together. The part of a bronze axe and the earthenware (cat. Nos 1 - 2) date from the period from the Middle Bronze Age up to and including the Early Iron Age and are much older than the other finds, which are datable to the early Roman period (cat. Nos 3 - 19). How the oldest three objects came to form part of this assemblage is not clear (perhaps because they were found in roughly the same area, or due to an administrative error). The most important elements of the Early Roman-period part of the assemblage are fragments of an Arretine sigilllata plate Ha 1 /Ic, an Aucissa brooch, two brooches of the Almgren 19 type, part of a helmet?, <b>rivets</b> or split <b>pins</b> of a belt hook decorated with red enamel, harness fittings, several fragments of a rectangular mirror and glass segmented beads. All that is known about the finds’ context is that the objects were found on ploughed land. No other finds from the same period (nor incidentally from later phases of the Roman period) are reported as having been found at ‘Barger-Oosterveld’. Exactly where in ‘Barger-Oosterveld’ the objects were found can no longer be determined. The finds probably represent the contents of one or more burials (at least one male burial and possibly – considering the presence of a mirror and beads – also a female burial). It is not known whether the finder observed any cremated remains. The military objects may well have belonged to a cavalryman who served in one of the auxiliary troops in the Augustan or early Tiberian era. But in which campaign(s) and in which unit (Ampsivarii?) he may have participated in the Germanic Wars we don’t know. In a northern Dutch/northern German perspective this is a highly exceptional find, because we don’t know of any such burials in this region. 347 362 45 / 46...|$|R
