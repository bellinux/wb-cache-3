Subjects and methods: Cross-sectional data from 8, 877 randomly selected patients were assessed during a 1 -year period by 209 GPs in the German federal state of Saxony. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> visits, performed procedures, and results of visits were documented. In this study, the data of patients aged 65  years and older are analyzed and the procedural and nonprocedural <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> visits are described. Results: In all, 2, 866 patients aged 65  years and older were included. The majority of patients (1, 807) were female. A total of 4, 426 <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> visits were found, distributed on 363 International Classification of Primary Care- 2 codes. In the mean, there were 1. 5 <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> a GP visit from each patient. The top five nonprocedural <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> visiting the GP were: cough (1. 8 %), back complaints (1. 6 %), shoulder complaints (1. 3 %), knee complaints (1. 1 %), and dyspnea (1. 0 % of all <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> visit). The top five procedural <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> visiting the GP included follow-up investigations of cardiovascular or endocrine disorders and immunizations. The top 30 nonprocedural <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> visits covered 21. 9 % of all <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> visiting. The top 30 procedural reasons covered 54. 3 % of all <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> visits. Conclusion: The current work indicates that people aged 65  years and older consult the GP more frequently for procedural than <b>for</b> nonprocedural <b>reasons.</b> The top 30 procedural and nonprocedural <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> visits cover ~ 75 % of all <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> visits in these patients.

40|$|This thesis {{tested a}} path {{model of the}} {{relationships}} of <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> drinking and <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> limiting drinking with consumption of alcohol and drinking problems. It was hypothesized that <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> drinking would be composed of positively and negatively reinforcing reasons, and that <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> limiting drinking would be composed of personal and social reasons. Problem drinking was operationalized as consisting of two factors, consumption and drinking problems, with {{a positive relationship between}} the two. It was predicted that positively and negatively reinforcing <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> drinking would be associated with heavier consumption and, in turn, more drinking problems, through level of consumption. Negatively reinforcing reasons were also predicted to be associated with drinking problems directly, independent of level of consumption. It was hypothesized that <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> limiting drinking would be associated with lower levels of consumption and would be related to fewer drinking problems, through level of consumption. Finally, among women, <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> limiting drinking were expected to be associated with drinking problems directly, independent of level of consumption. The sample, was taken from {{the second phase of the}} Niagara Young Aduh Health Study, a community sample of young adult men and women. Measurement models of <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> drinking, <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> limiting drinking, and problem drinking were tested using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. After adequate fit of each measurement model was obtained, the complete structural model, with all hypothesized paths, was tested for goodness of fit. Cross-group equality constraints were imposed on all models to test for gender differences. The results provided evidence supporting the hypothesized structure of <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> drinking and problem drinking. A single factor model of <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> limiting drinking was used in the analyses because a two-factor model was inadequate. Support was obtained for the structural model. For example, the resuhs revealed independent influences of Positively Reinforcing <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> Drinking, Negatively Reinforcing <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> Drinking, and <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> Limiting Drinking on consumption. In addition. Negatively Reinforcing Reasons helped to account for Drinking Problems independent of the amount of alcohol consumed. Although an additional path from <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> Limiting Drinking to Drinking Problems was hypothesized for women, it was of marginal significance and did not improve the model's fit. As a result, no sex differences in the model were found. This may be a result of the convergence of drinking patterns for men and women. Furthermore, it is suggested that gender differences may only be found in clinical samples of problem drinkers, where the relative level of consumption for women and men is similar...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} the interrelationships between self-objectification, body dissatisfaction, gender role orientation, perfectionism, and <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> exercise. A questionnaire assessing {{each of these}} constructs was completed by 149 male participants (M = 30. 28 years) who exercised regularly. Self-objectification showed positive correlations with appearance management <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> exercise, negative femininity, and intrapersonal perfectionism. Dimensions of body dissatisfaction showed positive correlations with self-objectification, appearance management <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> exercise, and intrapersonal perfectionism. Appearance management <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> exercise were found to mediate the relationship between self-objectification and dissatisfaction with muscularity, but not the relationship between self-objectification and dissatisfaction with leanness. Conversely, health management <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> exercise were negatively related to both self-objectification and dissatisfaction with overall appearance. Regression analyses showed that appearance management <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> exercise were the strongest predictor of both self-objectification and dissatisfaction with overall appearance. It was therefore speculated that appearance management exercise represented a negative behavioural consequence of self-objectification, whereas health management exercise {{could serve as a}} protective factor against self-objectification and body dissatisfaction...|$|R

Methods: The <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> Antipsychotic Discontinuation/Continuation (RAD) is a pair of questionnaires assessing these reasons from the perspectives of patients and their clinicians. Outpatients with schizophrenia (n = 199) who were not acutely ill participated in a 22 -week open-label study of olanzapine from November 2006 to September 2008. <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> continuing or discontinuing olanzapine (on a five-point scale), along with the single most important reason and the top primary reasons, were identified. Concordance between reasons given by patients and clinicians was assessed. Results: The top primary <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> continuing olanzapine were patients&# 39; perceptions of improvement, improvement of positive symptoms, and improved functioning. The study discontinuation rate was low (30. 2 %), and only a subset of patients who discontinued reported <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> medication discontinuation. The top primary <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> discontinuing olanzapine were insufficient improvement or worsening of positive symptoms, adverse events, and insufficient improvement or worsening of negative symptoms. Ratings given by patients and clinicians were highly concordant. Conclusion: The main <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> continuing or discontinuing olanzapine appears to be medication efficacy, especially <b>for</b> positive symptoms. <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> medication discontinuation differ somewhat from <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> continuation, with a high level of concordance between patient and clinician responses.
