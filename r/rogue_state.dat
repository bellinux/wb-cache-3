2500|$|Over {{the next}} stretch, the river {{receives}} Hog Creek from the left, passes Rattlesnake Rapids at RM136 (RK219), receives Little Butte Creek from the left, flows through Denman Wildlife Area and by TouVelle State Recreation Site, {{which is on}} its left. As it leaves TouVelle, it passes under Table Rock Road. Over the next few miles, the river flows by several gravel pits {{on the left and}} right near the Agate Desert and Kelly Slough. Whetstone and Bear creeks enter from the left as the river approaches the site of the former Gold Ray Dam, which was removed in 2010, and a USGS gauge at about [...] from the mouth. The river then passes Fishers Ferry Park, which is on the left, and receives Sams Creek and Water Gulch from the right. [...] At this point, Route 234 runs along the right bank of the river. Flowing by the former Gold Hill Dam and then the Gold Nugget Recreation Area and the Gold Hill Regional Park, both to the river's right, the Rogue passes under Route 234 and Oregon Route 99. It turns west, flowing between the city of Gold Hill and Route 99 on the right and the Ben Hur Lampman State Scenic Corridor and Interstate 5 (I-5), both on the left, at about RM119 (RK192). The Rogue receives Galls Creek from the left and Sardine Creek from the right before passing under Route 99, which continues parallel to it on the left. Crossing under I-5, the river flows between [...] it, now on the right, and Highway 99 along the edge of Valley of the <b>Rogue</b> <b>State</b> Park to about RM110 (RK180), where it receives Foots and Birdseye creeks from the left and passes the city of Rogue River, which is on the right bank. Further on, it receives Ward and Evans creeks from the right and Little Savage and Savage creeks from the left. It reaches the site of former Savage Rapids Dam at about RM107.5 (RK173), where it leaves Jackson County and enters Josephine County. Downstream, the river receives Rich Gulch from the right, passes Tom Pearce Park, receives Greens Creek from the left, Jones Creek from the right, Fruitdale Creek from the left, enters Grants Pass, and flows by a USGS gauge about [...] from the river mouth. In the city, it passes under U.S. Route 199 and Route 99. Allen Creek enters from the left before the river flows by Schroeder Park, on the left, and Lathrop Boat Landing, on the right shortly thereafter. Sand Creek enters from the left, and Vannoy Creek from the right before the Applegate River enters from the left at about RM95 (RK153). [...] The average stream gradient from the vicinity of Bear Creek to the Applegate River, is relatively low, [...]|$|E

Strategies used by the United States are further observed during the presidencies of George W.

Despite expectations, it appears that strategies used by the United States differ significantly and they are often influenced by historical experiences and strategic interests.

50|$|A common {{presumption}} {{applied to}} <b>rogue</b> <b>states</b> {{is that they}} do not necessarily behave rationally or in their own best interests.

40|$|This PhD {{examines}} {{the rise of}} the <b>rogue</b> <b>states</b> doctrine in US foreign policy, which had its roots in the presidencies of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush but was most clearly developed in the post-Cold War era by Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Cuba and Libya have been consistently classed as aggressive and destabilising regimes whose pursuit of Weapons of Mass Destruction and support for terrorism has rendered them on the 'wrong side of history' and a threat to US national security that has necessitated continued international activism and engagement on the world stage. The thesis contends that the doctrine's development has been informed by traditional US foreign policy drivers that pre-date the end of the Cold War, such as the concept of exceptionalism, and places the <b>rogue</b> <b>states</b> approach within a wider historical time frame. Having considered the roots of the <b>rogue</b> <b>states</b> doctrine, the thesis identifies and examines four episodes of its application in the period 1993 - 2004. These episodes, which are split equally between the Clinton and Bush administrations, demonstrate how hard-line rhetoric and policies that have targeted the regimes in question have failed to achieve international consensus and have been shaped by domestic considerations, such as the promotion of national missile defence and lobby group dynamics, rather than nuanced policy formulation. Detailed consideration of the US approach to <b>rogue</b> <b>states,</b> and an appreciation of its centrality to post-Cold War foreign policy, offers scope for both a critique of the Clinton and Bush strategies and a wider understanding of issues concerning US international behaviour in the period under consideration. By comparing the policies followed by the two administrations, the thesis identifies continuity in their approach to the <b>rogue</b> <b>states</b> that belies the apparent differences in the presidents' world views and foreign policy prescriptions. Finally, evaluation of the US approach to the states targeted under the doctrine raises questions about the utility of an approach that has favoured containment, sanctions, demonising rhetoric and military force for addressing the threat posed by a disparate set of international regimes.
