25|$|Some common {{exceptions}} include Trailers, {{which are}} issued only one plate, even {{in states that}} otherwise issue two plates to all passenger vehicles, while certain other non-passenger types, such as apportioned, may be issued in pairs even in states that otherwise issue only rear plates to passenger vehicles. Pennsylvania, for example, requires a front plate for semi-trailer trucks. Some vanity and specialty plates in Arizona and Kansas are issued in pairs, but only the <b>rear</b> <b>plate</b> is required on the vehicle; the front plate is free and fully optional.|$|E
25|$|Vehicle licence {{plates in}} Singapore {{are the same}} 520mm x 110mm size found in many European countries. Red licence plates {{indicate}} that the car may be driven only during off-peak times unless a daily fee is paid. Off peak times are from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. on weekdays and all day on Saturdays and Sundays. Since the end of January 2010, off-peak car usage is no longer restricted on Saturday, Sunday, and the days before public holidays. Off-peak licence plates cost less than regular ones. Standard licence plates in Singapore are usually black with silver or white lettering or the newer white front/yellow <b>rear</b> <b>plate</b> combination and Off-peak licence plates are white on red.|$|E

500|$|The barbettes were {{protected}} by [...] armour plates. The gun turrets that protected the main armament were six inches thick on their face, with three-inch sides and a [...] roof. They were initially built without a <b>rear</b> <b>plate</b> because of weight distribution {{problems with the}} turrets. The upper deck casemates {{were protected}} by [...] plates {{on the front and}} sides, but the main deck casemates had six-inch faces and sides. The stern torpedo tube was protected by a mantlet three to six inches thick. The sides of the forward conning tower were [...] thick while those of the rear conning tower were only three inches in thickness.|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Strickfaden {{created and}} {{maintained}} the laboratory equipment. Strickfaden recycled {{a number of}} the fancifully named machines he had created for the original Frankenstein for use in Bride, including the [...] "Cosmic Ray Diffuser", and the [...] "Nebularium". A lightning bolt generated by Strickfaden's equipment has become a stock scene, appearing in any number of films and television shows. The man behind the film's special photographic effects was John P. Fulton, head of the special effects department at Universal Studios at the time. Fulton and David S. Horsely created the homunculi over the course of two days by shooting the actors in full-size jars against black velvet and aligning them with the perspective of the on-set jars. The foreground film plate was rotoscoped and matted onto the <b>rear</b> <b>plate.</b> Diminutive actor Billy Barty is briefly visible from the back in the finished film as a homunculus infant in a high chair, but Whale cut the infant's reveal before the film's release.|$|E
500|$|The {{appearance}} of the resulting Verdeja 1 prototype was close to that originally envisioned in Captain Verdeja's first designs. [...] The vehicle's hull was elongated and the <b>rear</b> <b>plate</b> sloped, while the fuel capacity—and thus combat range—was increased, as was the ammunition capacity and {{the thickness of the}} armor. [...] The vehicle was fabricated in Bilbao, the only city in Spain with a heavy vehicle assembly line. [...] Due {{to the end of the}} Spanish Civil War and a shortage of funds, construction was postponed until May1940. [...] The prototype was completed three months later and delivered to the proving grounds in Carabanchel, Madrid, powered with basically the same Ford flathead V8 engine also used as the motive power of the three-tonne weight British Universal Carrier. A major external difference between the previous model and this prototype was the new, low-profile turret which allowed the 45 millimetre gun to depress and elevate from 8° to 70°. [...] The original 45millimetre model 1932 gun was exchanged with a new 45millimetre Mark I tank gun fabricated by S.A. Placencia de las Armas, in Spain. [...] However, the new prototype adopted the suspension and tracks from the original prototype. [...] In essence, the main advantages of the new prototype were its low-profile, high elevation of the main gun and the increased sloping of the armor from 12° to 45°. [...] It should be noted that the Verdeja 1 retained the original configuration by placing the engine in the front, to increase crew survivability.|$|E

500|$|Once {{the tanks}} reached the {{infantry}} line Second Lieutenant Ollie Connor fired some 22 2.36-inch rockets {{at a range}} of [...] from his M9A1 launcher tube. Some of these rockets failed to ignite. The remainder did and several struck the <b>rear</b> <b>plate</b> armor of several T-34s, where their armor was thinnest. The warheads failed to penetrate the armor, however, and the North Korean tanks continued their advance, ignoring the roadblock and continuing down the road. The operators assumed the roadblock was manned by South Korean troops, and ignored it since it did not pose them a serious threat. When the tank column came over {{the crest of the}} road, the forward howitzer, commanded by Corporal Herman V. Critchfield, Chief of Section and 5 cannoneers, fired its HEAT rounds, damaging the first two tanks and setting one of them on fire. One of the crew members of the burning tank emerged with a PPSh-41 and killed a member of an American machine gun crew before being killed himself; the American became the first casualty of Korean War ground combat. He was later identified, incorrectly, as Kenneth R. Shadrick. The howitzer, depleted of HEAT rounds, began firing high explosive rounds before being destroyed by the third T-34. The tanks then advanced, continuing to ignore the American howitzer and bazooka fire. U.S. forces managed to disable another North Korean T-34 when a 105mm shell struck and damaged its tracks. The tracks of the T-34 tanks cut communication signal wires between the infantry and artillery forces, further compounding the confusion. Perry was wounded in the leg by North Korean small arms fire as he was attempting to get the crew of the disabled tank to surrender. His artillery force continued firing at the North Korean tanks without effect.|$|E

2500|$|Nonetheless, {{the death}} rate among the air gunners {{remained}} exceptionally high and not until late models produced after 1944, was the 13mm (.5 in) <b>rear</b> <b>plate</b> of the armour shell moved rearwards into the (wooden) rear fuselage to allow a gunner to sit behind the fuel tank. The armour did not extend to the rear or below although side armour panels were riveted to the rear armour plate to protect the ammunition tank for the UBT machine gun, providing some measure of protection. The modifications including adding the rear gunner and gun had added weight behind the center of gravity, resulting in [...] "marginal" [...] stability and handling characteristics that were [...] "barely acceptable". The need to shift the aerodynamic center of the aircraft rearwards due to {{the weight of the}} added rear gunner and lengthened cockpit was the reason for the swept back outer wings in later Il-2s.|$|E

2500|$|In Nevada, all motor vehicles, {{with the}} {{exception}} of motorcycles and trailers, are issued two license plates. According to state law, most standard passenger vehicles issued two plates are required to display them on both the front and rear bumpers of the vehicle. Display of the front license plate, however, is optional for vehicles that either were not designed to have a front plate, or the manufacturer did not provide a plate bracket or other means for front display of a license plate. As a result, the law to display both the front and rear plates is rarely enforced, and {{it is not uncommon for}} owners of vehicles with Nevada license plates to remove the manufacturer-supplied front license plate brackets from their vehicles and display only the <b>rear</b> <b>plate.</b> In 2015, Wyoming passed a law, similar to Nevada, that does not require a front license plate on vehicles that either are not specifically designed to have a front plate, or the manufacturer did not provide a plate bracket or other means for front display of a license plate. Nebraska passed an identical law in 2016. In 2017, Montana also passed a similar law, exempting such passenger vehicles from displaying a front plate but requiring motorists to first obtain approval from the Montana Highway Patrol.|$|E
