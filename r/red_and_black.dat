5|$|Andover's {{traditional}} {{strip of}} <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>black</b> stripes was worn {{for the vast}} majority of their history. This was changed to <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>black</b> quarters in 1950 and remained so until 1957 when the club reverted to the traditional stripes. When promotion to the Southern League was gained in 1972, the team's colours were changed, this time to red with a single white stripe. This kit was worn until 1988, when the familiar <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>black</b> stripes were re-introduced. For the 2008–09 season, a plain red kit was introduced to commemorate the club's 125th anniversary—this was worn for the first time in the pre-season friendly against Salisbury City. The last away kit worn by the team was yellow and black shirts with white shorts. However, various combinations have been worn in recent years, such as white shirts with blue sleeves and blue shorts, and tangerine shirts with white shorts.|$|E

5|$|A {{competition}} {{for a new}} flag, held in June 2007, received 993 entries. Under the terms of UN talks, all such symbols would have to reflect the multi-ethnic nature of Kosovo, avoiding {{the use of the}} Albanian or Serbian double-headed eagles or the use of solely <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>black</b> or red, blue and white color schemes. <b>Red</b> <b>and</b> <b>black</b> are the colours used on the Albanian flag; red, blue and white are the main colours used on the Serbian flag. Additionally, all entries had to be rectangular and have a 2:3 proportion. The Kosovo Symbols Commission eventually selected three designs, which were then voted on by the Assembly of Kosovo (with a two-thirds majority required for approval), when independence was declared after the status talks. The three proposals selected were forwarded to the Assembly on 4 February 2008.|$|E

5|$|Green {{is one of}} {{the three}} colors (along with <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>black,</b> or red and gold) of Pan-Africanism. Several African {{countries}} thus use the color on their flags, including Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Senegal, Mali, Ethiopia, Togo, Guinea, Benin, and Zimbabwe. The Pan-African colors are borrowed from the Ethiopian flag, one of the oldest independent African countries. Green on some African flags represents the natural richness of Africa.|$|E
5|$|Leek's home colours have {{traditionally}} been all blue, and their away colours all yellow, both colours which reflect the town's coat of arms, which is predominantly blue and gold. The club has also used a blue and white kit {{similar to that of}} Blackburn Rovers, and a <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>black</b> away kit.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City's home colours are {{sky blue}} and white. Traditional away kit colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, {{in recent years}} several {{different}} colours have been used. The origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but {{there is evidence that}} the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled Famous Football Clubs – Manchester City published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side. The <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>black</b> away colours used infrequently yet recurrently come from former assistant manager Malcolm Allison, who believed that adopting the colours of A.C. Milan would inspire City to glory. Allison's theory worked, with City winning the 1969 FA Cup Final, 1970 League Cup Final and the 1970 European Cup Winners' Cup Final in <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>black</b> stripes as opposed to the club's home kit of sky blue.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} colours of the St Kilda Football Club are <b>red,</b> white <b>and</b> <b>black.</b> In the club's early years, from 1873 to 1896, {{the players}} wore a thinly striped <b>red,</b> white <b>and</b> <b>black</b> jumper; the stripes were later widened. In 1915, St Kilda changed its colours to <b>red,</b> yellow <b>and</b> <b>black,</b> to avoid {{playing in the}} colours of the German Empire's flag during a war against that country; in honour of allied power Belgium, they played in its flag colours {{for the remainder of}} the First World War. In 1923 the club returned to using the club's original colours of <b>red,</b> white <b>and</b> <b>black.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Rovers' colour scheme, {{based on}} the club's badge, was to be <b>red,</b> white <b>and</b> <b>black.</b> The club's {{prototype}} kit was announced on 19 February. It was a tri colour, consisting of <b>red</b> white <b>and</b> <b>black</b> thirds.|$|R

5|$|One of Ipswich Town's nicknames is The Blues, {{stemming}} from their traditional kit, which is predominantly blue. Since turning professional, Ipswich {{have used a}} number of away colours, including white, orange, <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>black</b> vertical stripes, claret and green, cream and black vertical stripes and dark blue and claret.|$|E
5|$|Some cicadas such as Hemisciera maculipennis display bright deimatic flash {{coloration}} {{on their}} hindwings when threatened; the sudden contrast helps to startle predators, giving the cicadas time to escape. The majority of cicadas are nocturnal {{and rely on}} camouflage when at rest, but some species are aposematic; the Malaysian Huechys sanguinea has conspicuous <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>black</b> warning coloration, is diurnal, and boldly flies about {{in full view of}} possible predators.|$|E
5|$|The German women's {{national}} football team wears white shirts with black shorts and white socks, following {{the tradition of}} the German men's team– black and white are the colours of Prussia. The current change kit is <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>black,</b> with black shorts and red socks. In the past, Germany also used green shirts with white shorts and green socks as the away kit.|$|E

5|$|The anions in {{compounds}} with {{bonds with}} the most ionic character tend to be colourless (with an absorption band in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum). In compounds with less ionic character, their colour deepens through yellow, orange, <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>black</b> (as the absorption band shifts to longer wavelengths into the visible spectrum).|$|E
5|$|X-Flight {{operates}} {{with two}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has 8 cars with 4 seats per car (2 {{on each side}} of the track) for a total of 32 riders per train.

5|$|Young was {{diagnosed}} with terminal cancer in late 2010. Following a supporter campaign, Manchester City dedicated their FA Cup tie at Leicester on 9 January 2011 to Young. Supporters wore <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>black</b> (the colours City wore in the 1969 final against Leicester), with proceeds from specially made scarves being split between Young and Wythenshawe Hospital. He died on 3 February 2011, just two weeks shy of his 67th birthday.|$|E

5|$|Certain diamond {{enhancement}} {{techniques are}} commonly used to artificially produce an array of colors, including blue, green, yellow, <b>red,</b> <b>and</b> <b>black.</b> Color enhancement techniques usually involve irradiation, including proton bombardment via cyclotrons; neutron bombardment in the piles of nuclear reactors; and electron bombardment by Van de Graaff generators. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's crystal lattice, knocking carbon atoms out of place and producing color centers. The depth of color penetration depends on the technique and its duration, {{and in some cases}} the diamond may be left radioactive to some degree.|$|E
5|$|Marble is {{the most}} {{significant}} mineral deposit of Romblon and {{is the most}} renowned product of the province. Based on statistics, Romblon is the second biggest provincial marble producer of the country next to Bulacan. Romblon marble is of very high quality and comes in shades of white, green, pink, <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>black.</b> The Mines and Geosciences Bureau has estimated that Romblon is endowed with about 150 million metric tons of marble. At current rates of extraction, the supply may last for three more centuries. Tablas Island is also believed to have vast reserves of marble.|$|E
5|$|On January 16, all sports-related extracurricular {{activities}} in New Brunswick were cancelled. Services were held across the country. Some schools {{asked students to}} wear <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>black,</b> the colours of Bathurst High School. The funeral for the seven deceased players was held in Bathurst at the K. C. Irving Regional Centre, which was filled with 6,000 people. An additional 3,500 mourners filled the adjacent rink to watch the service on a widescreen television. Elizabeth Lord's private funeral followed the next day.|$|E

5|$|The Maya {{had a long}} {{tradition}} of mural painting; rich polychrome murals have been excavated at San Bartolo, dating to between 300 and 200 BC. Walls were coated with plaster, and polychrome designs were painted onto the smooth finish. The majority of such murals have not survived, but Early Classic tombs painted in cream, <b>red,</b> <b>and</b> <b>black</b> have been excavated at Caracol, Río Azul, and Tikal. Among the best preserved murals are a full-size series of Late Classic paintings at Bonampak.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the 2008–09 season saw the Lions marking their 125th anniversary with a pre-season friendly against local rivals Salisbury City. Prior to the game, it had been announced that the club would also be wearing a new kit design to mark this occasion for one season only—a plain red shirt (a departure from the traditional <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>black</b> stripes) was worn {{for the first time}} during this game, which Andover won 3–2. The season itself saw Andover have their best run in the FA Trophy to date, eventually losing 0–3 at home to Newport County in the third qualifying round.|$|E
