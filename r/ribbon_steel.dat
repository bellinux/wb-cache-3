40|$|Abstract: Flat <b>Steel</b> <b>Ribbon</b> Wound Pressure Vessels (FSRWPVs) {{are used}} in many {{important}} industry areas. There is no such kind of pressure vessel exploding on operation for its reasonable structure design. Many explosion experiments on Flat <b>Steel</b> <b>Ribbon</b> Wound Pressure Vessel showed that their limited load pressure {{is related to the}} winding angle of the <b>steel</b> <b>ribbons.</b> FSRWPVs with reasonable winding angle have better security and lower cost. Reasonable angels given {{at the end of this}} paper facilitate engineering design...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} an experimental programme on reinforced concrete beams retrofitted with steel angles and pre-stressed stainless <b>steel</b> <b>ribbons</b> {{to increase their}} flexural strength and ductility. Two different configurations of the <b>steel</b> <b>ribbon</b> were designed, and two companion specimens for each type considered were subjected to a four-point bending test to facilitate a direct comparison {{in the analysis of}} the effectiveness of the retrofitting technique. The influence of longitudinal steel angles and transverse stainless <b>steel</b> <b>ribbons</b> is analysed, and the concrete confinement due to stainless <b>steel</b> <b>ribbons</b> examined. The strengthened beams show remarkable increments in flexural strength and ductility with respect to the as-built beam. Moreover, a simple cross-sectional model was adopted to calculate the flexural strength; then sophisticated numerical tools were used to reproduce both the experimental load-displacement curve and crack pattern for each specimen...|$|R
60|$|The bell, hung on {{the door}} {{by means of a}} curved <b>ribbon</b> of <b>steel,</b> was {{difficult}} to circumvent. It was hopelessly cracked; but of an evening, at the slightest provocation, it clattered behind the customer with impudent virulence.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{the second}} part of an {{experimental}} campaign investigating the efficiency of an alternative retrofitting method for increasing the flexural and/or shear capacity in reinforced concrete beams, based on the use of prestressed stainless <b>steel</b> <b>ribbons</b> and <b>steel</b> angles, is presented and analytically reproduced. This group of tests focuses on the ability of the adopted retrofitting method to improve the shear strength and ultimate deformation of reinforced concrete structural elements. As described in a companion paper, the adopted retrofitting method is alternative to traditional techniques of reinforced concrete retrofitting, being easy to install and usually reversible, and characterized by high fire resistance and avoiding corrosion. The experimental results obtained from shear tests carried out on nine reinforced concrete beams are presented. The efficiency of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>ribbons</b> as shear reinforcement that wrap a portion of cross-sectional depth are analyzed, and the interaction between existing stirrups and stainless <b>steel</b> <b>ribbons</b> examined. The tests results are critically analyzed, highlighting the ability of the retrofitting method in increasing the shear strength and ductility of reinforced concrete beams. The experimental shear strength was also analytically evaluated by extending the theoretical approach of the fib Model Code 2010 formulation, originally suggested for reinforced concrete beams with or without stirrups...|$|R
50|$|Starting {{from the}} Strathcona Streetcar Barn & Museum it travels {{on the former}} CP Rail line in a north west direction. It first passes the Calgary & Edmonton Railway Station Museum at present-day 105 Street; this is {{a replica of the}} station that was the {{northern}} anchor of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway from 1891 to 1908. After a level crossing stop at 107 Street, the streetcar goes under the Saskatchewan Drive, 109 Street, and Walterdale Hill intersection. While turning north, the middle stop is in the neighbourhood of Garneau at 90 Avenue, before getting on the High Level Bridge. After travelling high over the surface of the North Saskatchewan River, it continues over River Valley Road, and 97 Avenue, entering the <b>Ribbon</b> of <b>Steel</b> multi-use corridor. The <b>Ribbon</b> of <b>Steel</b> is a corridor designated by Alberta Infrastructure and the City of Edmonton for the preservation of streetcar rail in Edmonton, and to provide a running/cycling path between 109 Street and 110 Street, from 97 Avenue to Jasper Avenue. The first stop on the <b>Ribbon</b> of <b>Steel</b> is the Grandin stop, with walking access to the Grandin LRT Station, and the Legislature grounds. The northern terminus of the High Level Bridge Streetcar ride is at Jasper Plaza, just south of Jasper Avenue. The streetcar system that existed in Edmonton until 1951 ran though the downtown core, including down Jasper Avenue. The former rail line continued north, where 110 Street is now, to the Old CN Rail yard (north of 104 Avenue).|$|R
50|$|Barbed {{tape was}} first {{manufactured}} by Germany during World War I, as an expedient measure during {{a shortage of}} wire. Since it was simply punched out of a rolled <b>ribbon</b> of <b>steel</b> tape, it could be manufactured much more quickly. This early barbed tape had triangular barbs and no reinforcing wire; consequently, it was more difficult to cut with ordinary wire cutters, easier to cut with shears, and was generally of lower tensile strength.|$|R
50|$|The Torofluxus or Toroflux is a toy {{that was}} invented in mid-1990s by Jochen Valett. It is a 27 ft <b>ribbon</b> of <b>steel</b> which is woven into a torus spring. It is often sold pre-attached to a larger plastic ring. The spring flows {{downwards}} along the plastic ring, creating a shimmering effect like a silver bubble. The spring tension in the steel tightens the inner spiral core, causing it to cling to the plastic ring -— just like a silver bubble.|$|R

40|$|Commercial grade 17 - 7 PH {{stainless}} steel has been rapidly solidified (RS) by chill block melt spinning {{to result in}} an improvement in Vickers microhardness by 88 per cent, refinement in grain size {{by a factor of}} 9 and a significant suppression in delta-ferrite and carbide phases as compared to conventionally processed (CP) 17 - 7 PH steel. In order to study heat treatment response three different routes of hardening heat treatments were applied to RS 17 - 7 PH <b>steel</b> <b>ribbons.</b> These were (i) direct isochronal ageing, (ii) conventional double hardening treatment and (iii) direct conditioning coupled with isochronal ageing.

50|$|The {{bridge was}} planned {{so that it}} would be {{completed}} in time to mark the 50th anniversary of the Chinese Revolution of 1947. It was the first long-span bridge of its kind to be designed in China. Foundation work began in 1994. Engineering, manufacture and construction of the bridge was completed in just less than three years. The concrete towers are 190 m tall, roughly equivalent in height to a 60 story building. The main span, constructed by Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company, is made of flat streamlined steel box girders. The steel deck was erected by raising pre-assembled units weighing up to 500 metric tons with jacks. (pictures) The total investment of the bridge adds up to 2.728 billion yuan.

40|$|Severe plastic {{deformation}} routes (SPD) {{have been shown}} to be attractive for short time preparation of magnesium alloys for hydrogen storage, generating refined microstructures and interesting hydrogen storage properties when compared to the same materials processed by high-energy ball milling (HEBM), but with the benefit of higher air resistance. In this study, we present results of a new processing route for Mg alloys for hydrogen storage: rapid solidification followed by cold work. A Mg 97 Ni 3 alloy was processed by melt spinning (MS) and by extensive cold rolling (CR). Submitting Mg 97 Ni 3 <b>ribbons</b> between <b>steel</b> plates to cold rolling has shown to be a viable procedure, producing a thin cold welded foil, with little material waste.

40|$|An {{experiment}} to measure surface pressure {{data on a}} series of three stainless <b>steel</b> simulated parachute <b>ribbons</b> was conducted. During {{the first phase of the}} test, unsteady pressure measurements were made on the windward and leeward sides of the ribbons to determine the statistical properties of the surface pressures. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements were simultaneously made to establish the velocity field in the wake of the ribbons and its correlation with the pressure measurements. In the second phase of the test, steady-state pressure measurements were made to establish the pressure distributions. In the third phase, the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>ribbons</b> were replaced with nylon ribbons and PIV measurements were made in the wake. A detailed error analysis indicates that the accuracy of the pressure measurements was very good. However, an anomaly in the flow field caused the wake behind the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>ribbons</b> to establish itself in a stable manner on one side of the model. This same stability was not present for the nylon ribbon model although an average of the wake velocity data indicated an apparent 2 {degree} upwash in the wind tunnel flow field. Since flow angularity upstream of the model was not measured, the use of the data for code validation is not recommended without a second {{experiment to}} establish that upstream boundary condition...|$|R

5000|$|Also called torsion-spring pendulum, {{this is a}} wheel-like mass (most often four spheres on cross spokes) {{suspended}} from a vertical strip (<b>ribbon)</b> of spring <b>steel,</b> used as the regulating mechanism in torsion pendulum clocks. Rotation of the mass winds and unwinds the suspension spring, with the energy impulse applied {{to the top of}} the spring. With a period of 12—15 seconds, compared to the gravity swing pendulum's period of 0.5—2s, it is possible to make clocks that need to be wound only every 30 days, or even only once a year or more. This type is independent of the local force of gravity but is more affected by temperature changes than an uncompensated gravity-swing pendulum.|$|R
