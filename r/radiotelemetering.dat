40|$|Motor {{activity}} of the colon in the immediate postoperative period has been studied in human subjects using <b>radiotelemetering</b> capsules, radioopaque markers and serial abdominal radiographs. Following operations outside the abdomen there is a delay of about 16 hours before colonic activity returns. After abdominal operations the delay is from 40 to 48 hours. The length of an operation has no significant effect upon the duration of colonic ileus. The amount of postoperative analgesia has no significant effect upon the duration of colonic ileus.

40|$|Differential {{measurements}} {{of small and}} large bowel transit times were performed in 13 subjects iwth a <b>radiotelemetering</b> pressure-sensitive capsule incorporating less than 10 mugCi of 51 -Cr. Six patients had constipation. The other seven patients had diarrhoea due to the irritable bowel syndrome (3), following vagotomy and pyloroplasty (3), or due to laxative abuse (1). This new method enables the gastric, small intestinal, and colonic transit times to be measured differentially in the same subject. The capsule can be localized in the gut lumen by reference to the characteristic pressure pattern and in relation to bony landmarks by the radioactive marker as frequently as desired without recourse to radiographs. The results show that gastric emptying and small intestinal transit {{did not differ in}} constipation and diarrhoea. By contrast the mean colonic transit was significantly faster (P smaller than 0. 01) in diarrhoea whatever the cause (17. 5 plus or minus 4. 1 hours) than in constipation (118 plus or minus 4. 1 hours) ...|$|E

Changes evoked by clonidine (30 g/kg i. p.) in blood pressure, heart rate, and their variability were evaluated in ethanol [2. 5 or 5 % (w/v), 12 weeks] and pair-fed control rats. The blood pressure variability was determined {{as the standard}} deviation of the mean arterial pressure (SDMAP). Two heart rate variability indices were used, the standard deviation of beat-to-beat intervals (SDRR) and the root mean square of successive beat-to-beat differences in R-R interval durations (rMSSD).

Hamsters, the only animal manifesting HCPS-like disease, were instrumented with <b>radiotelemeters</b> that enabled ambulatory intracarotid blood pressure recording within an animal biosafety level- 4 facility. Following infection with Andes virus, blood pressure and heart rate decreased slowly in a biphasic manner during the first 7  days of infection, followed by a rapid fall in pressure and rapid increase in heart rate during the 10 – 20  h preceding death on day 9 or 10. The preterminal narrowing of pulse pressure was consistent with a cardiogenic impairment. Heart rate variability analysis implicated increased sympathetic nervous system activity as seen in human HCPS. The hamster model of HCPS mimics not only the pulmonary capillary leak but also the hypotension characteristic of human HCPS...|$|R

Under normal conditions, {{healthy people}} at submaximal {{exercise}} show a close correlation between work load and cardiac output (i. e. oxygen uptake versus heart rate, respectively). Subjects with chronic bronchospastic disease respond to specific bronchodilators(e. g. isoproterenol) with increases in heart rate [...] even without exercise. New bronchodilators (salbutamol) {{which do not}} exert such an influence on the heart rate are being studied for their effect on "exercise induced asthma. " Measurements of airway resistance(R(A)) and thoracic gas volume (V(tg)) during dynamic exercise (treadmill) pose complex instrumentation problems. The radiotelemetric determinations of specific airway conductance (G(A) /V(tg) where G(A) = 1 /R(A)) now appear practicable.

40|$|Mount Erebus {{is one of}} {{the active}} volcanoes in antarctica, and seismic {{observations}} of it have been made since December 1980 using a <b>radiotelemetered</b> network and several temporary stations. In the 1983 - 1984 field season, the number of the network stations was increased to eight by adding two new radio-telemetered stations. Volcanic earthquakes in and around Mount Erebus occurred at a rate of 20 - 160 events per day, which was almost the same rate as in the previous season. No intense earthquake swarm occurred in the 1983 - 1984 season. The earthquakes in this season are located wide around Mount Erebus. The clustered earthquakes have a dike-like distribution beneath the northern area of the central cone. An aseismic zone is recognized beneath the southwest area of the Erebus summit. This aseismic zone may correspond to a magma reservoir. The earthquakes which were not associated with the eruptions of Mount Erebus can be divided into several types according to their seismograms and spectra of the seismic waves. The seismic waves which may pass through the aseismic zone seem to be strongly attenuated as compared with those which may not pass through the zone...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{of right}} {{coronary}} artery blood flow, aortic and right ventricular (RV) pressures {{and heart rate}} were <b>radiotelemetered</b> during strenuous, spontaneous exercise in normal dogs and dogs with severe RV hypertrophy induced by chronic (5 - 6 mo) pulmonary artery stenosis. With fixed pulmonic stenosis, dogs with RV hypertrophy exhibited a decrease (P less than 0. 01) in arterial pressure during exercise. Under these conditions, exercise increased right coronary artery blood flow and decreased right coronary vascular resistance less (P less than 0. 05) in dogs with RV hypertrophy compared with normal. This attenuated response of right coronary artery blood flow of dogs with RV hypertrophy was not observed when arterial pressures remained at preexercise values during exercise. However, regardless of changes in arterial pressures during exercise, all dogs with RV hypertrophy demonstrated a striking postexercise coronary hyperemia (P less than 0. 01), suggesting a perfusion deficit of the hypertrophied right ventricle during exercise. These results imply a fundamental defect {{in the ability of}} the coronary circulation of the severely hypertrophied right ventricle to provide sufficient nutrient supply in the face of elevated metabolic demands of exercise...|$|R
40|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} have {{a higher}} risk of sudden death than the general population; however, the mechanism of these sudden deaths is unknown. Fatal arrhythmia generation during seizure, along with changes in autonomic tone, are hypothesised to be important factors. Six Wistar rats were stereotaxically injected with tetanus toxin into the ventral hippocampus, and implanted with <b>radiotelemeters</b> to record electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram. The heart rate was analysed in pre-ictal, ictal and post-ictal epochs with the aim of demonstrating the changes in autonomic tone during seizure. Ictal bradycardia was observed in 89 % of the seizures analysed, with post-ictal tachycardia in 93 %. Further, potentially lethal arrhythmias were observed during seizure. Missed beats (59 %), ventricular premature depolarisation (22 %) and ventricular fibrillation (17 %) are risk factors for sudden death in the general population and their presence during seizure could potentially be fatal. Whilst this study has demonstrated changes in autonomic tone and cardioarrhythmia generation; the extent of the changes and their mechanism need to be explored further. Nevertheless, this research validates the tetanus toxin model of temporal lobe epilepsy as a tool for investigating sudden death in epilepsy...|$|R
40|$|We report {{seasonal}} variation in steroid hormone levels in blood samples from free-ranging Western Diamond-backed Rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox), {{and the relationship}} between these hormones and events in the reproductive cycle. At a field site in the Sonoran Desert of south-central Arizona, we collected monthly blood samples over the course of two active seasons from 17 <b>radiotelemetered</b> females, and over three active seasons from 103 randomly encountered males. We used radioimmunoassay to measure plasma levels of 17 β-estradiol, progesterone, corticosterone, and testosterone in samples from females, and corticosterone and testosterone in samples from males. Non-reproductive females have consistently low levels of circulating 17 β-estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone throughout the year. In reproductive females, 17 β-estradiol levels increase dramatically and testosterone levels increase modestly during vitellogenesis in April and May, while progesterone levels increase dramatically at ovulation in June and then steadily decline until parturition in August. Corticosterone levels appear relatively constant in non-reproductive females, whereas reproductive females show increased levels at the end of gestation. Plasma testosterone levels in males are low in early summer and are elevated during spring and late summer, corresponding to the two mating periods of C. atrox. Plasma corticosterone levels in males did not vary seasonally and were not related to testosterone levels...|$|R
40|$|Vasopressinergic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus {{project to}} {{areas in the}} spinal cord from which {{sympathetic}} nerves originate. This pathway is hypothesized {{to be involved in}} the regulation of mean arterial pressure (MAP), particularly under various conditions of osmotic stress. Several studies measuring sympathetic nerve activity support this hypothesis. However, the evidence that spinal vasopressin influences MAP under physiological or pathophysiological conditions in conscious animals is limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate, in conscious rats, if the increases in MAP during acute or chronic osmotic stimuli are due to activation of spinal vasopressin (V 1 a) receptors. Three conditions of osmotic stress were examined: acute intravenous hypertonic saline, 24 - and 48 -h water deprivation, and 4 wk of DOCA-salt treatment. Rats were chronically instrumented with an indwelling catheter for intrathecal injections and a <b>radiotelemeter</b> to measure MAP. In normotensive rats, intrathecal vasopressin and V 1 a agonist increased MAP, heart rate, and motor activity; these responses were blocked by pretreatment with an intrathecal V 1 a receptor antagonist. However, when the intrathecal V 1 a antagonist was given during the three conditions of osmotic stress to investigate the role of “endogenous” vasopressin, the antagonist had no effect on MAP, heart rate, or motor activity. Contrary to the hypothesis suggested by previous studies, these findings indicate that spinal V 1 a receptors are not required for elevations of MAP under conditions of acute or chronic osmotic stress in conscious rats...|$|R
40|$|Bariatric surgery, such as {{vertical}} sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), causes remarkable {{improvements in}} cardiometabolic health, including hypertension remission. However, the mechanisms responsible remain undefined and poorly studied. Therefore, we developed and validated the first murine model of VSG that recapitulates the blood pressure-lowering effect of VSG using gold-standard radiotelemetry technology. We used this model to investigate several potential mechanisms, including body mass, brain endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling and brain inflammatory signaling, {{which are all}} critical contributors to the pathogenesis of obesity-associated hypertension. Mice fed on a high-fat diet underwent sham or VSG surgery and <b>radiotelemeter</b> implantation. Sham mice were fed ad libitum or were food restricted to match their body mass to VSG-operated mice to determine the role of body mass {{in the ability of}} VSG to lower blood pressure. Blood pressure was then measured in freely moving unstressed mice by radiotelemetry. VSG decreased energy intake, body mass and fat mass. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was reduced in VSG-operated mice compared with both sham-operated groups. VSG-induced reductions in MAP were accompanied by a body mass-independent decrease in hypothalamic ER stress, hypothalamic inflammation and sympathetic nervous system tone. Assessment of gut microbial populations revealed VSG-induced increases in the relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria and Enterococcus, and decreases in Adlercreutzia. These results suggest that VSG reduces blood pressure, but this is only partly due to the reduction in body weight. VSG-induced reductions in blood pressure may be driven by a decrease in hypothalamic ER stress and inflammatory signaling, and shifts in gut microbial populations...|$|R

We previously demonstrated endothelial dysfunction and abnormal aortic fatty acid composition in adult female offspring of rats fed animal lard during pregnancy. We have now further investigated this model. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a control breeding diet (5. 3 % fat) or a diet rich in lard (25. 7 % fat) 10 days before and throughout pregnancy and lactation. Male and female offspring were implanted with <b>radiotelemeters</b> for recording of blood pressure, heart rate, and activity at 80, 180, and 360 days of age. Reactivity to acetylcholine and to nitric oxide were assessed in isolated small mesenteric arteries from 80 - and 180 -day-old littermates. Systolic blood pressure (awake phase) was raised in female offspring (180 days: offspring of control, 130. 7 ± 1. 6 mm Hg, n= 5, versus offspring of lard-fed, 138. 1 ± 2. 9, n= 5, P= 0. 029; 360 days: offspring of control, 129. 7 ± 3. 7 mm Hg, n= 6, versus offspring of lard-fed, 142. 1 ± 3. 2, n= 6, P= 0. 005). Diastolic blood pressure was also raised at 180 days (offspring of control, 87. 6 ± 1. 0 mm Hg, n= 5, versus offspring of lard-fed, 94. 7 ± 2. 6, n= 5, P= 0. 011). Blood pressure was not raised in male offspring. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was blunted in male and female offspring of lard-fed dams (80 and 180 days). Feeding a diet rich in lard to pregnant rats leads to gender-related cardiovascular dysfunction in normally fed offspring...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Renovascular {{hypertension}} in mice {{is characterized}} by an elevation in hypothalamic angiotensin II levels. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is a major cardioregulatory site implicated in the neurogenic component of renovascular hypertension. Increased superoxide (O 2) production in the PVN is involved in angiotensin II–dependent neurocar-diovascular diseases such as hypertension and heart failure. Here, we tested the hypothesis that excessive O 2 production and activation of the redox-regulated transcription factor activator protein- 1 (AP- 1) in PVN contributes to the development and maintenance of renovascular hypertension. Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice underwent implantation of <b>radiotelemeters,</b> bilateral PVN injections of an adenovirus (Ad) encoding superoxide dismutase (AdCuZnSOD) or a control gene (LacZ), and unilateral renal artery clipping (2 -kidney, one-clip [2 K 1 C]) or sham surgery. AP- 1 activity was longitudinally monitored in vivo by bioluminescence imaging in 2 K 1 C or sham mice that had undergone PVN-targeted microinjections of an Ad encoding the firefly luciferase (Luc) gene downstream of AP- 1 response elements (AdAP- 1 Luc). 2 K 1 C evoked chronic hypertension {{and an increase in}} O 2 production in the PVN. Viral delivery of CuZnSOD to the PVN not only prevented the elevation in O 2 but also abolished renovascular hypertension. 2 K 1 C also caused a surge in AP- 1 activity in the PVN, which paralleled the rise in O 2 production in this brain region, and this was prevented by treatment with AdCuZnSOD. Finally, Ad-mediated expression of a dominant-negative inhibitor of AP- 1 activity in the PVN prevented 2 K 1 C-evoked hypertension. These results implicate oxidant signaling and AP-...|$|R
40|$|Electrocardiography (ECG) {{is one of}} the {{standard}} technologies used to monitor and assess cardiac function, and provide insight into the mechanisms driving myocardial pathology. Increased understanding of the effects of cardiovascular disease on rat ECG may help make ECG assessments in rat toxicology studies routine, thus facilitating continuous measurement of functional decre-ments associated with cardiotoxicant exposure. These studies seek to test the hypothesis that hypertensive rats are more susceptible to the short-term cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin (DOX) when compared with normotensive rats with respect to continuously measured ECG endpoints. Male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats surgically implanted with <b>radiotelemeters</b> were treated once a week for three weeks with either vehicle, 1. 25 (low), 2. 5 (medium), or 5 (high) mg/kg DOX (i. p.). ECG, heart rate (HR), and core body temperature (Tco) were continuously monitored during the 1 -week baseline and through-out the experimental period until rats were sacrificed 24 h after the third injection. DOX prevented normal body weight gain in both strains and significantly decreased diurnal HR and Tco of high DOX SH rats. In the ECG, SH rats had prolonged baseline PR intervals and QTc when compared with WKY rats. All DOX-treated WKY rats subsequently developed PR interval pro-longation; however only those treated with high DOX had increased QTc. DOX caused an increase in ST interval in SH rats, and resulted in ECG morphology changes. The number of arrhythmias due to DOX was increased in both strains. In conclusion, ECG analysis can reveal underlying cardiovascular disease as a risk factor in the heart’s response to toxicant-induced injury in the rat; and be a valuable tool to evaluate baseline vulnerability and assess cardiotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Increased ambient {{particulate}} matter (PM) levels {{are associated with}} cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as shown by numerous epidemiology studies. Few studies have investigated the role of copollutants, such as ozone, in this association. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which PM affects cardiac function remain uncertain. We hypothesized that PM and O 3 induce adverse cardiovascular effects in mice and that these effects are strain dependent. STUDY DESIGN: After implanting <b>radiotelemeters</b> to measure heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV) parameters, we exposed C 57 Bl/ 6 J (B 6), C 3 H/HeJ (HeJ), and C 3 H/HeOuJ (OuJ) inbred mouse strains to three different daily exposures of filtered air (FA), carbon black particles (CB), or O 3 and CB sequentially [O 3 CB; for CB, 536 ± 24 µg/m 3; for O 3, 584 ± 35 ppb (mean ± SE) ]. RESULTS: We observed significant changes in HR and HRV in all strains due to O 3 CB exposure, but not due to sequential FA and CB exposure (FACB). The data suggest that primarily acute HR and HRV effects occur during O 3 CB exposure, especially in HeJ and OuJ mice. For example, HeJ and OuJ mice demonstrated dramatic increases in HRV parameters associated with marked bradycardia during O 3 CB exposure. In contrast, depressed HR responses occurred in B 6 mice without detectable changes in HRV parameters. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that important interstrain differences exist with respect to PM- and O 3 -induced cardiac effects. This interstrain variation suggests that genetic factors may modulate HR regulation in response to and recuperation from acute copollutant exposures.

The overall distribution correlated with that of the AT(1 A) Rs mapped by other methods and demonstrated that the majority of C 1 neurons express the AT(1 A) R. Cre-recombinase expression in C 1 neurons of AT(1 A) R-floxed mice enabled demonstration that the pressor response to microinjection of angiotensin II into the rostral ventrolateral medulla is dependent upon expression of the AT(1 A) R in these neurons. Lentiviral-induced expression of wild-type AT(1 A) Rs in C 1 neurons of global AT(1 A) R knock-out mice, implanted with <b>radiotelemeter</b> devices for recording blood pressure, modulated the pressor response to aversive stress.
