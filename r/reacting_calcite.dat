40|$|The {{previous}} studies of citric-calcite have been limited to core flood, and bench scale experiments. However, the reaction kinetics of citric acid-calcite has not been measured. This paper gives, for the first time, the kinetics of citric-calcite reaction, which will provide {{a better way to}} model the performance of citric acid as a stand-alone stimulation fluid. In this study, the rotating disk was used to study citric-calcite reaction at 1, 000 psi, temperatures from 25 to 50 °C, citric acid concentrations of 1 to 7. 5 wt%, and disk rotational speeds of 100 to 1, 000 rpm. The results obtained showed that the citric-calcite reaction is dependent on both the rotational speed and temperature. The reaction of citric-calcite becomes surface-reaction controlled at temperatures of 25, 40, and 50 °C at rotational speeds greater than 450, 500, and 500 rpm, respectively. Although this surface reaction was expected to be enhanced by the chelation ability of citric acid, however {{it was found that the}} reaction was mainly governed by “H+ attack” mechanism at pH values < 3, and the “chelation” mechanism is not significant at these pH values. Calcium citrate precipitation occurred at the <b>reacted</b> <b>calcite</b> surface, even at low initial citric acid concentration, 1 wt%. Due to this precipitation, the equilibrium of citric-calcite reaction was disturbed, and the reaction shifted towards the forward reaction. Therefore, the overall reaction rate was mainly governed by the rate of the forward reaction, and hence, it was molded by simple reaction rate equation, rate = k*[Citric]n. The reaction order (n) was found to be less than 1. In addition, the value of the reaction constant (k) was determined at various temperatures. The effect of temperature on the reaction order was found to follow Arrhenius law. Mohammed H. AlKhaldi, Hisham Nasr-El-Din and Hemanta Sarma[URL]...|$|R

For fresh water, the measured porosity increased to 19 % and in the pore character distribution, {{there is a small}} shift towards smaller relaxation time. No remarkable change observed within the small peaks that correspond to the micropores. The core flooding data showed that there was a huge reduction in the permeability. This reduction in the permeability is associated with the fine migration of kaolinite which is 5 % in the Berea core. This fine migration plugs the pore throat and reduces the permeability. A minor increase in the porosity is also associated with fine migration from pores to pore throat. For HCl, the system changed from bi-modal to uni-modal after the flooding. The long peaks shift toward small relaxation time which can be clearly noticed. The clays present in the rock can react with the HCl and cause dissolution and precipitation. For example, HCl can react with the dolomite (1 %) and calcite (2 %) present in the rock resulting in dissolution. The reaction of HCl with chlorite (2 %) could produce precipitate and reaction with illite can result in fine migration. There are competing mechanisms as dissolution is improving the permeability, while precipitation and fine migration are resulting in permeability reduction. The macropores were converted to mesopores because HCl reacted with illite and reduced the size of macropores to mesopores. In the same time, HCl <b>reacted</b> with <b>calcite,</b> dolomite, and chlorite in the rock and created more mesopores.

Following an initial precipitation on the calcite grains, a period of slow growth oflepidocrocite was noted wherein 4 -/~m euhedral platelets formed with uniform orientation perpendicular to the calcite surface. The slow growth and highly crystalline nature of the Fe-oxide product may be partially due to the diffusion barrier formed by the growing oxide crystal mass which influenced rate of movement of HCOa- to the dissolved Fe phase and Fe ions and H + towards the calcite surface. Upon continued aging, the supernate became noticeably opaque.

From the results of such analyses, it was found that materials microstructure plays a fundamental role in the actual extent to which weathering mechanisms affect natural and artificial stones. Consequently, the need of taking into account the important role of material microstructure, when evaluating the environmental aggressiveness to natural and artificial stones, was highlighted. Therefore, a possible quantification of the role of microstructure on the resistance to environmental attack was investigated. By exposing stone samples, with significantly different microstructural features, to slightly acidic aqueous solutions, simulating clean and acid rain, a good correlation between weight losses and the product of carbonate content and specific surface area (defined as the “vulnerable specific surface area”) was found. Alongside the evaluation of stone vulnerability, {{the development of a new}} consolidant for weathered carbonate stones was undertaken. The use of hydroxya-patite, formed by <b>reacting</b> the <b>calcite</b> of the stone with an aqueous solution of di-ammonium hydrogen phosphate, was found to be a promising consolidating tech-nique for carbonates stones. Indeed, significant increases in the mechanical prop-erties can be achieved after the treatment, which has the advantage of simply con-sisting in a non-hazardous aqueous solution, able to penetrate deeply into the stone (> 2 cm) and bring significant strengthening after just 2 days of reaction. Furthermore, the stone sorptivity is not eliminated after treatment, so that water and water vapor exchanges between the stone and the environment are not com-pletely blocked. ...|$|R

40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{important}} discoveries of the Phoenix Lander were the detection of approx. 0. 6 % perchlorate [1] and 3 - 5 % carbonate [2] in landing site soils. The Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA) instrument on the Phoenix lander could heat samples up to approx. 1000 C and monitor evolved gases with a mass spectrometer. TEGA detected a low (approx. 350 C) and high (approx. 750 C) temperature CO 2 release. The high temp release was attributed to the thermal decomposition of Ca-carbonate (calcite). The low temperature CO 2 release could be due to desorption of CO 2, decomposition of a different carbonate mineral, or the combustion of organic material. A new hypothesis has also been proposed that the low temperature CO 2 release could be due to the early breakdown of calcite {{in the presence of the}} decomposition products of certain perchlorate salts [3]. We have investigated whether or not this new hypothesis is also compatible with organic combustion. Magnesium perchlorate is stable as Mg(ClO 4) 2 - 6 H 2 O on the martian surface [4]. During thermal decomposition, this perchlorate salt releases H 2 O, Cl 2, and O 2 gases. The Cl 2 can react with water to form HCl which then <b>reacts</b> with <b>calcite,</b> releasing CO 2 below the standard thermal decomposition temperature of calcite. However, when using concentrations of perchlorate and calcite similar to what was detected by Phoenix, the ratio of high:low temperature CO 2 evolved is much larger in the lab, indicating that although this process might contribute to the low temp CO 2 release, it cannot account for all of it. While H 2 O and Cl 2 cause calcite decomposition, the O 2 evolved during perchlorate decomposition can lead to the combustion of any reduced carbon present in the sample [5].

Fluorine can be neglected as the molecular proportion of fluoro-talc and fluoro-tremolite is less than 0. 017. The sequence of talc and tremolite reactions and their areal extent suggests that talc is stable at low pressures. Two prograde reaction paths, indicating ditrerent X(CO), can be traced at different zone boundaries within the nodules. One path corresponds to reactions within the mantle or at the matrix-mantle boundary. The other path corresponds to reactions at the core-mantle bound-ary and persisted as long as dolomite and quartz remained in the core of the nodules. Once quartz was consumed in the nodules the two paths converged. Small but signi-ficant fluid composition diferences [- 0. 1 X(COr) ] existed across the reaction rims, which are I mm to several cm wide. These X(COr) differences reflect the buffering capacities of mineral assem-blages at zone boundaries, and perhaps the opposing outward flow ofCOz-rich fluid derived from the reactions and inward flow of HrO-rich matrix pore fluid.

While the argillaceous formations have been extensively studied since {{more than two decades}} as potential host-rocks for nuclear waste disposal, only few studies have dealt with the potential degradation of their containment properties as caprocks induced by a CO 2 attack. This paper focuses on the impact of a CO 2 -enriched fluid on the diffusive transport parameters of indurated argillaceous samples originating from the massif of Tournemire (Aveyron, France). Two through-diffusion experiments were carried out, the first one with a CO 2 -enriched fluid and the second one with an equilibrated fluid, chemistry of which is very close to that measured in-situ. Non-radioactive (deuterium and bromide) and radioactive tracers (tritium and Cl- 36) were successively used. Throughout the duration of the experiments, the evolution of water chemistry was monitored by measuring pH, Ca, Na, Mg, K, Cl, SO 4, TOC and alkalinity. The effect of the CO 2 stress has been clearly evidenced. On the one hand, the tracer fluxes in the downstream reservoir of the cell having undergone CO 2 attack were up to 3 times higher than in the reference cell, indicating a significant increase of the porosity and effective diffusion coefficient values (up to 100 % for Cl- 36 porosity and up to 300 % for Cl- 36 effective diffusion coefficient).

Magnesium-silicate minerals such as serpentine [Mg 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4] and olivine (Mg 2 SiO 4) react with CO 2 to produce magnesite (MgCO 3), and the calcium-silicate mineral, wollastonite (CaSiO 3), <b>reacts</b> to form <b>calcite</b> (CaCO 3). It is possible to carry out these reactions either ex situ (above ground in a traditional chemical processing plant) or in situ (storage underground and subsequent reaction with the host rock to trap CO 2 as carbonate minerals). For ex situ mineral carbonation to be economically attractive, the reaction must proceed quickly to near completion. The reaction rate is accelerated by raising the activity of CO 2 in solution, heat (but not too much), reducing the particle size, high-intensity grinding to disrupt the crystal structure, and, in the case of serpentine, heat-treatment to remove the chemically bound water. All of these carry energy/economic penalties. An economic study illustrates the impact of mineral availability and process parameters on the cost of ex situ carbon sequestration. In situ carbonation offers economic advantages over ex situ processes, because no chemical plant is required. Knowledge gained from the ex situ work was applied to long-term experiments designed to simulate in situ CO 2 storage conditions. The Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG), a multi-layered basaltic lava formation, has potentially favorable mineralogy (up to 25 % combined concentration of Ca, Fe 2 +, and Mg cations) for storage of CO 2.

Air pollution has been affecting cultural heritage along with human health. Limestone is one of the most affected building materials from the air pollution. Carbon, sulphure and nitrogen gases are the main components which are affective in the deterioration of limestone and their rate increased with air pollution. Sulphure dioxide (SO 2) <b>reacts</b> with the <b>calcite</b> crystals (CaCO 3) that are the main structure of limestone and leads to the formation of gypsum (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O). In this study, the formation of gypsum on limestone was investigated on the façade of the Botter Apartment within the restoration and conservation studies. For this purpose physical, mineralogical and chemical compositions of weathered limestone were determined by XRD, SEM-EDS, FT-IR and TGA analyses. The weathering forms caused by air pollution were documented with drawing (mapping) and photographs of front façade of Botter Apartment. The results of the study indicated that gypsum formation on limestone surfaces is mainly originated from wet and dry deposition process of sulphur dioxide. Condensation may also play an important role in gypsum formation on such sheltered surfaces in addition to dry deposition. On sheltered surfaces of limestone, due to the dry deposition of gypsum formation proceeds as black crust formation. The gypsum formation has not restricted on the surface of limestone. Deeper penetration and absorption of sulphure dioxide are observed in limestone because of their more porous structure. In Istanbul average daily temperature is low and average relative humidity and sulphure dioxide concentrations are high in winter time. The results of this study indicated that İstanbul atmosphere, with its coinciding high relative humidity and high sulphure dioxide concentrations in winter have led to gypsum formation on limestone.

40|$|Abstract For {{anchoring}} CO 2 isotopic {{measurements on}} the δ 18 OVPD-CO 2 scale, the primary reference material (NBS 19 calcite) {{needs to be}} digested using concentrated ortho-phosphoric acid. During this procedure, great {{care must be taken}} to ensure that the isotopic composition of the liberated gas is accurate. Apart from controlling the reaction temperature to ± 0. 1 °C, the potential for oxygen isotope exchange between the produced CO 2 and water must be kept to a minimum. The water is usually assumed to reside on the walls in the headspace of the reaction vessel. We demonstrate here that a large fraction of the exchange may also occur with water inside the acid. Our results indicate that both exchange reactions {{have a significant impact on}} the results and may have largely been responsible for scale inconsistencies between laboratories in the past. The extent of CO 2 /H 2 O oxygen exchange depends on the concentration (amount of free water) in the acid. For acids with a nominal H 3 PO 4 mass fraction of less than 102 %, oxygen isotope exchange can create a substantial isotopic bias during high-precision measurements with the degree of the alteration being proportional to the effective isotopic contrast between the acid and the CO 2 released from the calcite. Water evaporating from the acid at 25 °C has a δ 18 O value of − 34. 5 ‰ relative to the isotopic composition of the whole acid. This large fractionation is likely to occur in two steps; by exchange with phosphate, water inside the acid is decreased in oxygen- 18 relative to the bulk acid by ∼ − 22 ‰. This water is then fractionated further during evaporation. Oxygen exchange with both water inside the acid and water condensate in the headspace can contribute to the measured isotopic signature depending on the experimental parameters. The system employed for this study has been specifically designed to minimize oxygen exchange with water. However, the amount of altered CO 2 for a 95 % H 3 PO 4 at 25 °C still accounts for about 3 % of the total CO 2 produced from a 40 [*]mg calcite sample, resulting in a δ 18 O range of about 0. 8 ‰ when varying the δ 18 O value of the acid by 25 ‰. Least biased results for NBS 19 -CO 2 were obtained for an acid with a δ 18 O value close to + 23 ‰ vs. VSMOW. In contrast, commercial acids from several sources had an average δ 18 O value of + 13 ‰, amounting to a 10 ‰ offset from the optimal value. This observation suggests that the well-known scale incompatibilities between laboratories could arise from this difference with measurements that may have suffered systematically from non-optimal acid-δ 18 O values, thus producing variable offsets, depending on the experimental details. As a remedy, we suggest that the δ 18 O of phosphoric acid <b>reacted</b> with <b>calcites</b> for establishing a δ 18 O scale anchor be adjusted, and this should reduce the variability of the δ 18 O of CO 2 evolved in acid digestion to less than ± 0. 05 ‰. The adjustment should be made by taking into account the difference in δ 18 O between the calcite-CO 2 and the acid, with a target difference of 16 ‰. With this strategy, agreement between δ 18 O scales based on water, atmospheric CO 2, and carbonates as well as data compatibility between laboratories may be substantially improved.

40|$|This work {{is based}} on the idea that an acid mixture of {{hydrochloride}} and sulpheric acid <b>react</b> with the <b>calcite</b> in a chalk oilfield to create anhydrite which has a larger molecular size. This will clog the present fractures to prohibit that these fractures sometimes shortcut the injected water from the injector well to the producing oil well which otherwise would result in artificial thieve zones. In this work mass balance calculations and experimental lab work has been done to see how the acidic reaction works. It is concluded that during the conversion of calcite to anhydrite 60 % of the resulting CO 2 is dissolved in the present liquid; the rest is in the gaseous phase. The samples of fractured chalk are approximately 30 cm long and have a diameter of 10 cm. The fracture is situated in the flow direction. The samples are tested under reservoir conditions, and the flow rate of the acids is 2 ml/min. The resulting permeability change indicates that the fracture is sealed after half an hour of acid injection, but this seal in the fracture is only a pasty substance clogging the flow. After approximately six hours of injection the first wormholes appear and the fracture is totally sealed. Mass change is calculated based on the amount of anhydrite created during acid injection. The mass changes are equivalent to the mass change measured during the experiment. CT-scans are made before, during and after many experiments and each scan series of approximately 300 images. These images are used in a specially written program to divide all present volume components in the chalk: fracture, calcite, anhydrite, wormholes and fossils. They are also used to calculate volume percentages, and coincide with the calculated weight percentages. Fracture experiments under reservoir temperature and pressure conditions and Brazilian tests under atmospheric are done on the sealed samples to see if the fractures can be reopened. The samples were tested with an annular pressure of 310 bar, 80 oC and injection pressure of 270 bar. The production pressure was released, even with a pressure difference over the core of 160 bar and did not fracture. The tensile strength of the sealed samples proved to be as strong as original chalk samples without fractures. Petroleum EngineeringGeotechnologyCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{behaviour}} of U(VI) in hyperalkaline fluid/calcite systems was studied over a {{range of}} U(VI) concentrations (5. 27 × 10 − 5 μM to 42. 0 μM) and in two high pH systems, young and old synthetic cement leachate in batch sorption experiments. These systems were selected to be representative of young- (pH 13. 3) and old-stage (pH 10. 5) leachate evolution within a cementitious geological disposal facility. Batch sorption experiments, modelling, extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, electron microscopy, small angle X-ray scattering and luminescence spectroscopy were used to define the speciation of U(VI) across the systems of study. At the lowest concentrations (5. 27 × 10 − 5 μM 232 U(VI)) significant U removal was observed for both old and young cement leachates, and this was successfully modelled using a first order kinetic adsorption modelling approach. At higher concentrations (> 4. 20 μM) in the young cement leachate, U(VI) showed no interaction with the calcite surface over an 18 month period. Small angle X-ray scattering techniques indicated that at high U concentrations (42. 0 μM) and after 18 months, the U(VI) was present in a colloidal form which had little interaction with the calcite surface and consisted of both primary and aggregated particles with a radius of 7. 6 ± 1. 1 and 217 ± 24 Å, respectively. In the old cement leachate, luminescence spectroscopy identified two surface binding sites for U(VI) on calcite: in the system with 0. 21 μM U(VI), a liebigite-like Ca 2 UO 2 (CO 3) 3 surface complex was identified; at higher U(VI) concentrations (0. 42 μM), a second binding site of undetermined coordination was identified. At elevated U(VI) concentrations (> 2. 10 μM) in old cement leachate, both geochemical data and luminescence spectroscopy suggested that surface mediated precipitation was controlling U(VI) behaviour. A focused ion beam mill was {{used to create a}} section across the U(VI) precipitate–calcite interface. Transmission electron microscope images of the section revealed that the calcite surface was coated with a nano crystalline, U containing phase. Selected area electron diffraction images of the U precipitate which was formed at a U(VI) concentration of 4. 20 μM were consistent with the formation of calcium uranate. XAS spectroscopy at higher concentrations (⩾ 21. 0 μM) suggested the formation of a second U(VI) phase, possibly a uranyl oxyhydroxide phase. These results indicated that in the young cement leachate, U(VI) did not <b>react</b> with the <b>calcite</b> surface unless U(VI) concentrations were very low (5. 27 × 10 − 5 μM). At higher concentrations, speciation calculations suggested that U(VI) was significantly oversaturated and experimental observations confirmed it existed in a colloidal form that interacted with the mineral surface only weakly. In the old cement leachate systems at low concentrations batch sorption and luminescence data suggested that U(VI) removal was being driven by a surface complexation mechanism. However, at higher concentrations, spectroscopic methods suggest a combination of both surface complexation and surface mediated precipitation was responsible for the observed removal. Overall, U(VI) behaviour in hyperalkaline calcite systems is distinct from that at circumneutral pH conditions: at high pH and anything but low U(VI) concentrations, a surface mediated precipitation mechanism occurs; this is in contrast to circumneutral pH conditions where U(VI) surface complexation reactions tend to dominate...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric mineral dust {{has a large}} {{impact on}} the earth’s {{radiation}} balance and climate. The radiative effects of mineral dust depend on factors including, particle size, shape, and composition which can all be extremely complex. Mineral dust particles are typically irregular in shape and can include sharp edges, voids, and fine scale surface roughness. Particle shape can also depend {{on the type of}} mineral and can vary as a function of particle size. In addition, atmospheric mineral dust is a complex mixture of different minerals as well as other, possibly organic, components that have been mixed in while these particles are suspended in the atmosphere. Aerosol optical properties are investigated in this work, including studies of the effect of particle size, shape, and composition on the infrared (IR) extinction and visible scattering properties in order to achieve more accurate modeling methods. Studies of particle shape effects on dust optical properties for single component mineral samples of silicate clay and diatomaceous earth are carried out here first. Experimental measurements are modeled using T-matrix theory in a uniform spheroid approximation. Previous efforts to simulate the measured optical properties of silicate clay, using models that assumed particle shape was independent of particle size, have achieved only limited success. However, a model which accounts for a correlation between particle size and shape for the silicate clays offers a large improvement over earlier modeling approaches. Diatomaceous earth is also studied {{as an example of a}} single component mineral dust aerosol with extreme particle shapes. A particle shape distribution, determined by fitting the experimental IR extinction data, used as a basis for modeling the visible light scattering properties. While the visible simulations show only modestly good agreement with the scattering data, the fits are generally better than those obtained using more commonly invoked particle shape distributions. The next goal of this work is to investigate if modeling methods developed in the studies of single mineral components can be generalized to predict the optical properties of more authentic aerosol samples which are complex mixtures of different minerals. Samples of Saharan sand, Iowa loess, and Arizona road dust are used here as test cases. T-matrix based simulations of the authentic samples, using measured particle size distributions, empirical mineralogies, and a priori particle shape models for each mineral component are directly compared with the measured IR extinction spectra and visible scattering profiles. This modeling approach offers a significant improvement over more commonly applied models that ignore variations in particle shape with size or mineralogy and include only a moderate range of shape parameters. Mineral dust samples processed with organic acids and humic material are also studied in order to explore how the optical properties of dust can change after being aged in the atmosphere. Processed samples include quartz mixed with humic material, and <b>calcite</b> <b>reacted</b> with acetic and oxalic acid. Clear differences in the light scattering properties are observed for all three processed mineral dust samples when compared to the unprocessed mineral dust or organic salt products. These interactions result in both internal and external mixtures depending on the sample. In addition, the presence of these organic materials can alter the mineral dust particle shape. Overall, however, these results demonstrate the need to account for the effects of atmospheric aging of mineral dust on aerosol optical properties. Particle shape can also affect the aerodynamic properties of mineral dust aerosol. In order to account for these effects, the dynamic shape factor is used to give a measure of particle asphericity. Dynamic shape factors of quartz are measured by mass and mobility selecting particles and measuring their vacuum aerodynamic diameter. From this, dynamic shape factors in both the transition and vacuum regime can be derived. The measured dynamic shape factors of quartz agree quite well with the spheroidal shape distributions derived through studies of the optical properties...|$|R
