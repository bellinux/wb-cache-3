5|$|Delhi Metro {{has been}} {{registering}} a continuous increase in <b>ridership</b> since its inception. When Metro services {{were introduced in}} 2002, the average <b>ridership</b> was 80,000 passengers per day. As of FY 2016-17, average daily <b>ridership</b> has risen to 2.76 million, with the latest daily <b>ridership</b> record set on 17 August 2016.|$|E
5|$|The highest <b>ridership</b> for {{a single}} day was {{on the day of}} the inauguration of Barack Obama, January 20, 2009, with 1,120,000 riders. It broke the {{previous}} record, set the day before, of 866,681 riders. June 2008 set several <b>ridership</b> records: the single-month <b>ridership</b> record of 19,729,641 total riders, the record for highest average weekday <b>ridership</b> with 1,044,400 weekday trips, had five of the ten highest <b>ridership</b> days, and had 12 weekdays in which <b>ridership</b> exceed 800,000 trips.|$|E
5|$|BART <b>ridership</b> {{has grown}} rapidly since 2010, {{mirroring}} strong {{economic growth in}} the Bay Area. In 2015, the system was carrying approximately 100,000 more passengers each day than it had five years earlier. High gasoline prices also contributed to growth, pushing <b>ridership</b> to record levels during 2012, with the system recording five record <b>ridership</b> days in September and October 2012. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, BART recorded an average weekday <b>ridership</b> of 423,395, the second-highest in its history, but a 2.3% drop from 2016. <b>Ridership</b> growth began to slow in late 2016, and dropped by 1.7% in October 2016 from the prior year. The line to the San Francisco International Airport lost riders, while ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft grew by a factor of almost six or nearly 500% at the airport during 2014–2016. BART planners believe that competition from Uber and Lyft is reducing overall <b>ridership</b> growth and BART's share of SFO airport transit. Some see the decline in transit use in large U.S. cities as part of a national trend, linked to changes in commute patterns, the fall in gasoline prices since 2014, and competition from the private sector in the form of ride-sharing services.|$|E
5|$|By annual <b>ridership,</b> the New York City Subway is {{the busiest}} rapid transit rail system {{in both the}} Western Hemisphere and the Western world, {{as well as the}} seventh busiest rapid transit rail system in the world; only the metro (subway) systems in Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo, Guangzhou, and Moscow record higher annual <b>ridership.</b> In 2015, the subway {{delivered}} over 1.76 billion rides, averaging approximately 5.7 million daily rides on weekdays and a combined 5.9 million rides each weekend (3.3 million on Saturdays; 2.7 million on Sundays). <b>Ridership</b> continues to increase, and on September 23, 2014, more than 6.1 million people rode the subway system, establishing the highest single-day <b>ridership</b> since <b>ridership</b> was regularly monitored in 1985.|$|E
5|$|City {{planning}} staff {{estimate that}} the peak <b>ridership</b> of the one-stop extension to be 7,300 in the peak hour and peak direction, {{about half of the}} 15,000 peak <b>ridership</b> considered the low end to justify a subway. With the original three-stop extension, the peak <b>ridership</b> estimate was 9,500 to 14,000; however, that estimate was reduced to 7,300 because of competition from the proposed SmartTrack and by the elimination of two of the three original stops. Mayor John Tory and Scarborough Councillor Glenn De Baeremaeker say a peak <b>ridership</b> of 7,300 would still be acceptable as it is still greater than the 6,000 peak at terminal station Kipling. However, a Toronto Star article points out there is only one station within 6 kilometres of Scarborough Town Centre but more stations are within 6 kilometres of other terminal stations to boost <b>ridership.</b> The SSE would carry an estimate 31,000 riders per day as compared to 66,355 riders from Kipling to Jane (five stations) and 96,660 riders from Finch to York Mills (four stations). The SSE performs better in <b>ridership</b> only against the terminal of the underperforming Line 4 Sheppard line.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that only 7,000 daily riders entered the station between September 13–22, 2015, drastically below the MTA's projected <b>ridership</b> of 32,000 passengers upon the station's opening. This was attributed to incompleteness of developments in the area, {{as well as an}} unopened entrance to the High Line park, which is nearby. In late October 2015, AM New York found that the average daily <b>ridership</b> was even lower, at only 5,900 passengers per day, except for during the 2015 New York Comic Con on October 8–11, when average daily <b>ridership</b> reached 18,300 daily riders. The station's official <b>ridership</b> between September 13 and December 31, 2015, was 692,165, making it the 392nd busiest station in the city out of 422 total stations. <b>Ridership</b> at the station increased in 2016 with 2,691,851 riders, making it the 189th busiest station in the city out of 422 total stations.|$|E
5|$|Revenues grew {{along with}} <b>ridership</b> {{over the first}} three years, but <b>ridership</b> {{remained}} below expectations. In 2008 {{the second year of}} operation, revenues fell barely short of THSRC's expectations a year earlier of a doubling of first-year results.|$|E
5|$|After {{two years}} of the scheme {{achieved}} pre-tax profitability and has exceeded the original <b>ridership</b> targets.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the opening}} of Phase 1, <b>ridership</b> on the Lexington Avenue Line at the 68th Street, 77th Street, 86th Street, and 96th Street {{stations}} decreased in January 2017 compared to in January 2016. The Second Avenue Line's three stations and the renovated Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station saw an average weekday <b>ridership</b> of more than 150,000 {{by the end of}} January. The 72nd Street station was the busiest of the line's new stations, with an average daily <b>ridership</b> of 44,000. By April, taxi usage in the area also saw a decline of more than 20% compared to before the line's opening. By May 15, Second Avenue <b>ridership</b> had increased to 176,000 passengers a day, reducing overall usage on the Lexington Avenue Line by 26% while representing a 42% increase from the Second Avenue <b>ridership</b> in January. Because of the increasing demand, Q service will be increased by one downtown trip in the morning and by one uptown trip in the evening on November 6, 2017. In addition, one northbound R trip was rerouted from the IND Queens Boulevard Line to further boost service. This trip will return southbound in the evening in Q service.|$|E
5|$|Due to an {{increase}} of <b>ridership,</b> the MTA has tried to increase capacity wherever possible by adding more frequent service, specifically during the evening hours. However, this increase will not likely {{keep up with the}} growth of subway <b>ridership.</b> Some lines have capacity for additional trains during peak times, but there are too few subway cars for this additional service to be operated.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{the station}} had 27,004 entries, making the station among the system's least-used. This {{amounted}} to only 52 boardings per weekday in 2009, representing a 71.6 percent decrease from the station's 1990 <b>ridership.</b> In 2010, there were 29,644 recorded entries, and in 2011, there were 54,183 entries. Since {{the station was}} closed through 2012, there were no boardings, but after full-time service was restored to the station in 2013, there was a significantly higher <b>ridership,</b> with 213,601 recorded entries in 2013 and 630,644 entries in 2014. The increase in <b>ridership</b> at the station and the nearby Aqueduct–North Conduit Avenue station since 2010 {{has been attributed to}} the end of off-track betting at the racetrack in 2010, and the opening of the casino in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{the most}} recent year for which {{statistics}} are available, AirTrain JFK carried 6,487,118 paid passengers, with another 10 million using the service for free on-airport travel. This is a 247% increase over 2004, the first full year of operation, when 2,623,791 riders paid. The 2014 paid <b>ridership</b> is 12% of the 53.2 million passengers that used JFK that year. The <b>ridership</b> of AirTrain JFK has risen each year from 2004 to 2014, which Governor Andrew Cuomo touted in a 2015 announcement in which he also announced the plan for AirTrain LaGuardia, a similar system to be built at LaGuardia Airport. The $5 fare is much cheaper than the $45 one must pay for a taxi between Manhattan and JFK, which may be a factor in the increased <b>ridership.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, Governor Malloy {{announced}} that 5 weekend round trips would {{be extended to}} New London beginning in April 2013. However, the extension was dependent on ongoing negotiations with the marine industry over mandated closings of the Old Saybrook – Old Lyme bridge. Two weekday midday trips were added in May 2013, while weekend service began on June 1, 2013, after the application for additional bridge closings {{was approved by the}} state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. By July, New London represented 26% of weekend <b>ridership.</b> In December 2013, the state {{announced that}} <b>ridership</b> was up 35% for the year {{as a result of the}} increased service. From 2009 to 2014, monthly New London <b>ridership</b> increased from less than 1,000 monthly passengers to approximately 5,000, accounting for a significant fraction of <b>ridership</b> increases on Shore Line East during that period.|$|E
5|$|Original {{estimates}} {{predicted a}} daily <b>ridership</b> of 180,000 after launch, growing to 400,000 by 2036. In {{view of a}} 50% drop in airline passengers {{in the wake of}} the 1997 Asian financial crisis, forecasts were revised downwards. The final initial <b>ridership</b> estimate was 140,000 passengers per day. Actual initial <b>ridership</b> did not match these projections. In September 2007, six months after opening, THSRC carried 1.5million passengers monthly, translating to about 50,000 passengers daily. In the second year, passenger numbers almost doubled. In the third year, average daily <b>ridership</b> continued to grow to 88,000 passengers per day, jumping to over 120,000 passengers per day in 2012. (updated to September 2012) Seat occupancy was around 45% in the first three years, with a modest improvement achieved in 2009, and reached 53.91% in 2012. (updated to September 2012) Punctuality is stable above 99%.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ridership</b> is moderate, {{relative}} to the other Hudson Line stations, {{with an average of}} 865 inbound passengers on weekdays and 233 on weekends in 2007. Historical <b>ridership</b> included many notable passengers, including William Rockefeller, John D. Rockefeller, C. C. Clarke (the First Vice President of the Hudson River Railroad), Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt Shepard, Walter William Law, and the Webb family.|$|E
5|$|Since 2010, <b>ridership</b> on the G {{has risen}} 17%, with {{approximately}} 150,000 riders per weekday in 2015. It is the route with {{the fastest growing}} <b>ridership</b> base in the entire system. These improvements will also have the side benefit {{of being able to}} accommodate the growing <b>ridership</b> base in gentrified neighborhoods along the G, like Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, and Long Island City. This is due in part because the G weekday frequencies have become more dependable {{as a result of its}} 2013 review. However, weekend service was still lacking, according to some riders.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months after}} the Anacostia Station opened, WMATA said that a study of bus and rail <b>ridership</b> showed that the {{unaltered}} bus routes were costing the transit agency $200,000 a month in lost rail fares. To make up the lost revenue, WMATA {{said that it would}} run only two-car trains (the shortest on the system) on the Green Line during slow periods weekdays and evenings and on Sundays beginning in June 1992. In November 1992, WMATA reported that <b>ridership</b> at the Anacostia Station was (on average) 7,500 riders a day, 700 below estimates. WMATA admitted that although riders had made the switch from bus to rail, the lower <b>ridership</b> numbers were due to the recession and not because of continuing downtown bus service in the area. Metro said <b>ridership</b> on buses in the neighborhood was down significantly, and the transit agency reduced the number of buses on some routes to avoid having empty buses.|$|E
5|$|When {{the station}} opened in 1989, daily <b>ridership</b> on the Roosevelt Island Tramway, an aerial tramway that also connects Roosevelt Island to Manhattan, {{decreased}} sharply, from 5,500 daily riders in 1989 to 3,000 by 1993. In 2008, the station saw about 5,900 daily riders, compared to 3,000 for the tram, which had maintained steady <b>ridership.</b> Over {{the next eight}} years, the station experienced additional <b>ridership</b> growth. In 2016, an average of 6,630 daily riders used the station on an average weekday. This amounted to 2,110,471 total riders entering the station in 2016.|$|E
5|$|After {{significant}} <b>ridership</b> {{gains in}} 1984, PennDOT proposed {{that a second}} train {{be added to the}} route. PennDOT and Amtrak would have split the costs evenly. Amtrak officials were favorable, but budget problems stalled the plan.|$|E
5|$|By January 24, {{the number}} {{had risen to}} more than 30,600 per day—three {{times as many as}} {{originally}} estimated. Angry commuters using the Anacostia, Navy Yard, and Waterfront stations peppered the transit agency with complaints. WMATA claimed that a number of factors contributed to the <b>ridership</b> crunch: the system was experiencing record ridership; two-year-old <b>ridership</b> projections were used; the five stations were opened two months ahead of schedule; the five new stations were opened two months before new rail cars were ready for service; and WMATA offered free parking at the Green Line stations, which drew 12,000 rather than 4,000 riders to the line.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to a low}} {{supply of}} petrol, bus traffic was {{replaced}} by electric tramways during the war. The trams experienced therefore an increase in <b>ridership,</b> from 64 million passengers per year in 1939 to 151 million in 1944. The three lines of Holmenkolbanen had together a <b>ridership</b> of 9.5billion in 1939, 10.9billions in 1940, 21 billions in 1943 and at the peak 22.6 billion passengers in 1945. In addition to the regular tram passenger services, Oslo Sporveier started to transport goods across the city in tram wagons.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that it mainly serves Aqueduct Racetrack, the station is not well-used {{compared}} to other stations in the system. During the 1970s <b>ridership</b> at the station declined, from 1.1 million passengers in 1975 to 573,000 in 1979.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, <b>ridership</b> {{increased}} by 10 percent and by 12 percent the following year. In 1971 and 1972, it saw a 20-percent increase—the latter representing {{the first year}} with InterRail tickets. By then the annual <b>ridership</b> had reached 175,000. In 1970, an additional train was stationed at Flåm, which {{made it possible to}} travel a round trip between Flåm and Bergen in a day. Between 1975 and 1982, NSB started running direct trains between Ål and Flåm. In 1978, the morning express trains on the Bergen Line started stopping at Myrdal, allowing better access for tourists to the Flåm Line. Traffic increased further until 1980, when it hit 200,000, and then remained stable through the decade.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to private development, several joint-development affordable housing projects {{have recently been}} constructed along the Metrorail line {{with the intent of}} increasing <b>ridership</b> through transit-oriented development. These projects include Santa Clara apartments, Brownsville Transit Village, and The Beacon, which is located near Historic Overtown/Lyric Theater Station in Downtown Miami. The headquarters of Miami-Dade Transit, also located next to Historic Overtown/Lyric Theater Station, is known as the Overtown Transit Village. Brownsville Transit Village, opening in March 2012, was visited by the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Lisa P. Jackson, on January 5, 2012 to tour the 490-unit development, which will save an estimated five million gallons of water and $50,000 annually in utility bills due to environmentally sustainable plumbing fixtures. Nonetheless, by 2016, Brownsville and Santa Clara were still the lowest <b>ridership</b> stations, the only ones to regularly post <b>ridership</b> numbers below 1,000 daily. In general, stations to the north of Civic Center see much lower <b>ridership,</b> on average one-third of stations from Civic Center south. They are mostly in industrial areas with low population density and little development, as well as stagnant or declining populations, such as Gladeview and Brownsville. Additionally, stations to the north of Earlington Heights are only served by one line, giving them much longer headways.|$|E
5|$|In the {{financial}} year 2016-17, Delhi metro {{had an average}} daily <b>ridership</b> of 2.76 million passengers, and served 100 crore (1.0bn) riders in total during the year.|$|E
5|$|Lawton Area Transit System (LATS) {{provides}} {{public transit}} for both Lawton and Fort Sill. Founded in 2002, LATS had a <b>ridership</b> of 427,088 in 2009, and provides five major routes throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|On 25 December 2014, it was {{reported}} that the <b>ridership</b> of the Airport Express had almost doubled in the past year to almost 600,000 passengers per month now, as compared to just above 300,000 {{at the beginning of the}} calendar year.|$|E
5|$|On October 30, 2010, {{the crowd}} at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear broke a 19-year record in Saturday <b>ridership,</b> with 825,437 trips. The {{previous}} record had been set on June 8, 1991 at 786,358 trips during the Desert Storm rally.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ridership</b> on the Mountaineer {{over its}} two-year {{probationary}} period was disappointing: 58,991 in 1975 and 53,400 in 1976. Averaged over a 365-day year, this was 161 passengers {{per day in}} 1975 and 146 in 1976. By 1977 daily <b>ridership</b> had dwindled to 35. Monetary losses were far higher than expected: $5.7 million in FY1975 and $14.9 million in FY1976. After a brief respite, Amtrak discontinued the Mountaineer on May 31, 1977. A new train, the Hilltopper, operated {{over much of the}} same route until 1979.|$|E
5|$|Since opening, it {{has seen}} higher-than-expected <b>ridership.</b> While 4 million paid {{passengers}} and 8.4 million inter-terminal passengers were originally supposed {{to ride the}} system yearly, the system accommodated 6.4 million paid passengers and 10 million inter-terminal passengers in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Swift {{carried a}} total of 1,621,838 riders on the Blue Line in 2015, making it the most popular route {{operated}} by Community Transit, and accounting for 16.2% of the agency's total <b>ridership.</b>|$|E
5|$|The New York City Board of Transportation, and its successor, MTA New York City Transit, has had {{numerous}} events that promote increased <b>ridership</b> of their transit system.|$|E
5|$|The R1 {{is a line}} of Rodalies de Catalunya's Barcelona {{commuter}} rail service, operated by Renfe Operadora. It runs northwards from the Barcelona area to the southern limits of the province of Girona, passing through the coastal Maresme region. Since 2014, some services have been extended further north towards Portbou, near the French border. These services are designated RG1 and are {{considered part of the}} Girona {{commuter rail}} service. The line had an annual <b>ridership</b> of 28million in 2016, achieving an average weekday <b>ridership</b> of 102,214 according to 2008 data.|$|E
5|$|The South Shore Line, an {{electric}} commuter railroad, connects the South Bend International Airport to Millennium Station in downtown Chicago. Due to increased <b>ridership</b> since 2005 between Chicago and South Bend, more cars are being added.|$|E
5|$|The line {{opened on}} 12 July 1904 {{and at the}} opening there were {{delivered}} two six-axle steam locomotives from Hartmann, which were named Lier and Hole. The railway also took delivery of two passenger cars, a combined freight and conductor car, {{and a number of}} freight cars. Periodically the railway needed extra haulage power, and therefore sometimes leased locomotives from the Norwegian State Railways. The initial fares were NOK1.30 from Lier to Svangstrand, while the ferry across the lake cost an additional NOK1.50. The greatest <b>ridership</b> was during the summer, when tourists took the line to reach the steam ships. During winter, the <b>ridership</b> fell, and the railway terminated at Sylling instead of Svangerstrand.|$|E
5|$|This station {{opened on}} October 29, 1989 {{along with the}} entire IND 63rd Street Line. The opening of the subway {{resulted}} in a steep decline in Roosevelt Island Tramway <b>ridership.</b>|$|E
