25|$|Watteau was a {{prolific}} draftsman. His drawings, typically executed in trois crayons technique, were collected and admired even by those, such as Caylus or Gersaint, who found fault with his paintings. In 1726 and 1728, Jean de Jullienne published suites of etchings after Watteau's drawings, and in 1735 he published {{a series of}} engravings after his paintings, The <b>Recueil</b> Jullienne. The quality of the reproductions, using a mixture of engraving and etching following {{the practice of the}} Rubens engravers, varied according to the skill of the people employed by Jullienne, but was often very high. Such a comprehensive record was hitherto unparalleled. This helped disseminate his influence round Europe and into the decorative arts.|$|E
25|$|In {{view of the}} {{scarcely}} disguised {{ambitions and}} intrigues of the Austrian court, Montgelas now believed that the interests of Bavaria lay in a frank alliance with the French Republic; he succeeded in overcoming the reluctance of Maximilian Joseph and on 24 August a separate treaty of peace and alliance with France was signed in Paris. By the third article of this the First Consul undertook {{to see that the}} compensation promised under the 7th article of the treaty of Lunéville for the territory ceded on the left bank of the Rhine, should be carried out {{at the expense of the}} Empire in the manner most agreeable to Bavaria (see de Martens, <b>Recueil,</b> vol. vii. p.365).|$|E
25|$|According to the <b>Recueil</b> des Inscriptions Gauloises, {{more than}} 760 Gaulish {{inscriptions}} {{have been found}} throughout present-day France, with the notable exception of Aquitaine, and in northern Italy. Inscriptions include short dedications, funerary monuments, proprietary statements, and expressions of human sentiments, but the Gauls also left some longer documents of a legal or magical-religious nature, the three longest being the Larzac tablet, the Chamalières tablet and the Lezoux dish. The most famous Gaulish record is the Coligny calendar, a fragmented bronze tablet dating from the 2nd century AD and providing the names of Celtic months over a five-year span; it is a lunisolar calendar attempting to synchronize the solar year and the lunar month by inserting a thirteenth month every {{two and a half}} years.|$|E

25|$|In 1798, {{he entered}} the École Polytechnique in Paris as first in his year, and {{immediately}} began to attract the notice of the professors of the school, who left him free {{to make his own}} decisions as to what he would study. In 1800, less than two years after his entry, he published two memoirs, one on Étienne Bézout's method of elimination, the other on the number of integrals of a finite difference equation. The latter was examined by Sylvestre-François Lacroix and Adrien-Marie Legendre, who recommended that it should be published in the <b>Recueil</b> des savants étrangers, an unprecedented honour for a youth of eighteen. This success at once procured entry for Poisson into scientific circles. Joseph Louis Lagrange, whose lectures on the theory of functions he attended at the École Polytechnique, recognized his talent early on, and became his friend (the Mathematics Genealogy Project lists Lagrange as his advisor, but this may be an approximation); while Pierre-Simon Laplace, in whose footsteps Poisson followed, regarded him almost as his son. The rest of his career, till his death in Sceaux near Paris, was nearly occupied by the composition and publication of his many works and in fulfilling the duties of the numerous educational positions to which he was successively appointed.|$|E

500|$|It {{is unknown}} what title William himself gave his chronicle, {{although}} {{one group of}} manuscripts uses Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum and another uses Historia Ierosolimitana. The Latin text was printed {{for the first time}} in Basel in 1549 by Nicholas Brylinger; it was also published in the Gesta Dei per Francos by Jacques Bongars in 1611 and the <b>Recueil</b> des historiens des croisades (RHC) by Auguste-Arthur Beugnot and Auguste Le Prévost in 1844, and Bongars' text was reprinted in the Patrologia Latina by Jacques Paul Migne in 1855. The now-standard Latin critical edition, based on six of the surviving manuscripts, was published as Willelmi Tyrensis Archiepiscopi Chronicon in the Corpus Christianorum in 1986, by R. B. C. Huygens, with notes by Hans E. Mayer and Gerhard Rösch. The RHC edition was translated into English by Emily A. Babcock and August C. Krey in 1943 as [...] "A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea," [...] although the translation is sometimes incomplete or inexact.|$|E
500|$|The russet sparrow was scientifically described, as Fringilla rutilans, by the Dutch {{zoologist}} Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1836, from {{a specimen}} collected in Japan. Its specific {{name comes from}} the Latin rutilus, [...] "of a glowing or auburn red". Temminck's description is contained in his Nouveau <b>recueil</b> de planches coloriées d'oiseaux which was issued in 102 livraisons or parts between 1820 and 1839. It was at one time believed that the livraison containing {{the description of the}} russet sparrow was issued in 1835 but it has now been established that it appeared in 1836 sometime after 30 April. The English ornithologist John Gould described a specimen of the russet sparrow collected in the Himalayas {{at a meeting of the}} Zoological Society of London in December 1835 under the binomial name Pyrgita cinnamomea. His description was included in the volume of the society's proceedings for 1835 that was published on 8 April 1836. Some taxonomists give priority to Gould's publication and use the binomial name Passer cinnamomeus for the russet sparrow.|$|E
