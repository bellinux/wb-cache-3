5|$|Doppler <b>redshift</b> vs cosmological red-shift: Astronomersoften {{refer to}} the cosmological red-shift as a normal Doppler shift,which is a misconception. Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not {{identical}} to the Doppler <b>redshift.</b> The Doppler <b>redshift</b> is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of space. On the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler <b>redshift.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some redshifts are {{an example}} of the Doppler effect, {{familiar}} in the change of apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles. A <b>redshift</b> occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. A special instance of this is the cosmological <b>redshift,</b> which is due to the expansion of the universe, and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million light years away) show <b>redshift</b> corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from Earth. Finally, gravitational <b>redshift</b> is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. However, <b>redshift</b> is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative <b>redshift.</b>|$|E
5|$|Supernova {{searches}} {{fall into}} two classes: those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking farther away. Because of {{the expansion of the}} universe, the distance to a remote object with a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its Doppler shift (or redshift); on average, more-distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby, and so have a higher <b>redshift.</b> Thus the search is split between high <b>redshift</b> and low <b>redshift,</b> with the boundary falling around a <b>redshift</b> range of z=0.1–0.3—where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum's frequency shift.|$|E
40|$|In this letter, the old {{issue of}} whether <b>redshifts</b> of quasars are of cosmological origin is investigated. We make a plot of {{absorption}} <b>redshifts</b> versus emission <b>redshifts</b> for quasars with large amounts of data. Our study shows that, almost all absorption <b>redshifts</b> are smaller than the corresponding emission <b>redshifts.</b> The relation between the absorption and emission <b>redshifts</b> predicted by current cosmological models is well obeyed. The result confirms that <b>redshifts</b> of quasars are indeed distance indicators. It {{might be the most}} obvious evidence found so far to be consistent with the cosmological interpretation of quasar <b>redshifts.</b> Comment: 6 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
40|$|Questions {{regarding}} {{the origin of}} quasi-stellar objects with their large <b>redshifts</b> are discussed. Evidence concerning the cosmological origin of the <b>redshifts</b> is examined. There appears to be some fairly strong evidence which suggests the presence of noncosmological <b>redshifts.</b> Most astronomers, however, still take the view that all <b>redshifts</b> have a cosmological origin. The different types of evidence currently available are listed in tables...|$|R
30|$|The {{puzzle of}} “accelerating” <b>redshifts</b> {{is one of}} the most {{interesting}} in Physics. Lower <b>redshifts</b> increase linearly with distance, indicating expansion of the Universe. <b>Redshifts</b> of distant Type Ia supernovae appear to increase non-linearly, leading to speculation about acceleration and repulsive energies. Since <b>redshifts</b> are related to the speed of light, secular change in c may precisely explain the “accelerating” puzzle.|$|R
5|$|With {{advent of}} {{automated}} telescopes {{and improvements in}} spectroscopes, a number of collaborations {{have been made to}} map the Universe in <b>redshift</b> space. By combining <b>redshift</b> with angular position data, a <b>redshift</b> survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky. These observations are used to measure properties of the large-scale structure of the Universe. The Great Wall, a vast supercluster of galaxies over 500 million light-years wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that <b>redshift</b> surveys can detect.|$|E
5|$|A special {{relativistic}} <b>redshift</b> formula (and its classical approximation) {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the <b>redshift</b> of a nearby object when spacetime is flat. However, in many contexts, such as black holes and Big Bang cosmology, redshifts must be calculated using general relativity. Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true <b>redshift</b> and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and radiative transfer).|$|E
5|$|For galaxies {{more distant}} than the Local Group {{and the nearby}} Virgo Cluster, but within a {{thousand}} megaparsecs or so, the <b>redshift</b> is approximately proportional to the galaxy's distance. This correlation was first observed by Edwin Hubble and {{has come to be}} known as Hubble's law. Vesto Slipher was the first to discover galactic redshifts, in about the year 1912, while Hubble correlated Slipher's measurements with distances he measured by other means to formulate his Law. In the widely accepted cosmological model based on general relativity, <b>redshift</b> is mainly a result of the expansion of space: this means that the farther away a galaxy is from us, the more the space has expanded in the time since the light left that galaxy, so the more the light has been stretched, the more redshifted the light is, and so the faster it appears to be moving away from us. Hubble's law follows in part from the Copernican principle. Because it is usually not known how luminous objects are, measuring the <b>redshift</b> is easier than more direct distance measurements, so <b>redshift</b> is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble's law.|$|E
50|$|Photometric <b>redshifts</b> were {{originally}} determined by calculating the expected observed {{data from a}} known emission spectrum at a range of <b>redshifts.</b> In recent years, Bayesian statistical methods and artificial neural networks {{have been used to}} estimate <b>redshifts</b> from photometric data.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that any}} {{comparison}} between values of Δμ/μ at substantially different <b>redshifts</b> {{will need a}} particular model to govern the evolution of Δμ/μ. That is, results consistent with zero change at lower <b>redshifts</b> do not rule out significant change at higher <b>redshifts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The field imaged by the ACS {{contains}} over 10,000 objects, {{the majority}} of which are galaxies, many at <b>redshifts</b> greater than 3, and some that probably have <b>redshifts</b> between 6 and 7. [...] The NICMOS measurements may have discovered galaxies at <b>redshifts</b> up to 12.|$|R
5|$|High <b>redshift</b> {{searches}} for supernovae usually involve {{the observation of}} supernova light curves. These are useful for standard or calibrated candles to generate Hubble diagrams and make cosmological predictions. Supernova spectroscopy, used to study the physics and environments of supernovae, is more practical at low than at high <b>redshift.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{prediction}} that the CMB temperature was {{higher in the}} past has been experimentally supported by observations of very low temperature absorption lines in gas clouds at high <b>redshift.</b> This prediction also implies that the amplitude of the Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies does not depend directly on <b>redshift.</b> Observations have found this to be roughly true, but this effect depends on cluster properties that do change with cosmic time, making precise measurements difficult.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} {{gravitational}} lensing {{is found in}} the radio galaxy 3C 324. First thought to be a single overluminous radio galaxy with a <b>redshift</b> of z=1.206, it was found in 1987 to actually be two galaxies, with the radio galaxy at the aforementioned <b>redshift</b> being lensed by another galaxy at <b>redshift</b> z=0.845. The first example of a multiply-imaged radio galaxy discovered, the source appears to be an elliptical galaxy with a dust lane obscuring our view of the visual and ultraviolet emission from the nucleus. In even shorter wavelengths, the BL Lac object PG 1553+113 is a heavy emitter of gamma rays. This object is the most distant found to emit photons with energies in the TeV range as of 2007. The spectrum is unique, with hard emission in some ranges of the gamma-ray spectrum in stark contrast to soft emission in others.|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of <b>redshifts</b> provides a significant observational bottleneck when using galaxy cluster surveys to constrain cosmological parameters. We propose a simple method {{to allow the}} use of samples {{where there is a}} fraction of the <b>redshifts</b> that are not known. The simplest assumption is that the missing <b>redshifts</b> are randomly extracted from the catalogue, but the method also allows one to take into account known selection effects in the {{accumulation of}} <b>redshifts.</b> We quantify the reduction in statistical precision of cosmological parameter constraints {{as a function of the}} fraction of missing <b>redshifts</b> for simulated surveys, and also investigate the impact of making an incorrect assumption for the distribution of missing <b>redshifts.</b> Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures, accepted by Ap...|$|R

5|$|As Eddington {{pointed out}} in 1924, densities of this order implied that, {{according}} {{to the theory of}} general relativity, the light from Sirius B should be gravitationally redshifted. This was confirmed when Adams measured this <b>redshift</b> in 1925.|$|E
5|$|As the Universe expands, {{more distant}} objects recede from the Earth faster, {{in what is}} called the Hubble Flow. The light from very distant galaxies is {{significantly}} affected by the cosmological <b>redshift.</b> While quasars with high redshifts were known, very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before the HDF images were produced. The HDF, however, contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six, corresponding to distances of about 12 billion light-years. Due to <b>redshift</b> the most distant objects in the HDF (Lyman-break galaxies) are not actually visible in the Hubble images; they can only be detected in images of the HDF taken at longer wavelengths by ground-based telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for {{the early}} {{appearance}} of galaxies was found in 2006, when {{it was discovered that}} the galaxy IOK-1 has an unusually high <b>redshift</b> of 6.96, corresponding to just 750 million years after the Big Bang and making it the most distant and primordial galaxy yet seen.|$|E

5|$|The HDF data {{provided}} extremely rich material for cosmologists to analyse and by late 2014 the associated scientific paper for the image had received over 900 citations.

5|$|The {{afterglow}} of GRB970508 {{reached a}} peak total luminosity 19.82days after the burst was detected. It then faded {{with a power}} law slope over about 100days. The afterglow eventually disappeared, revealing the burst's host, an actively star-forming dwarf galaxy with an apparent magnitude of V=25.4±0.15. The galaxy was well fitted by an exponential disk with an ellipticity of 0.70±0.07. The <b>redshift</b> of GRB 970508's optical afterglow, z=0.835, agreed with the host galaxy's <b>redshift</b> of z=0.83, suggesting that, unlike previously observed bursts, GRB 970508 may {{have been associated with}} an active galactic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|The {{spectrum}} {{of light that}} comes from a single source (see idealized spectrum illustration top-right) can be measured. To determine the <b>redshift,</b> one searches for features in the spectrum such as absorption lines, emission lines, or other variations in light intensity. If found, these features can be compared with known features in the {{spectrum of}} various chemical compounds found in experiments where that compound is located on Earth. A very common atomic element in space is hydrogen. The spectrum of originally featureless light shone through hydrogen will show a signature spectrum specific to hydrogen that has features at regular intervals. If restricted to absorption lines it would look similar to the illustration (top right). If the same pattern of intervals is seen in an observed spectrum from a distant source but occurring at shifted wavelengths, it can be identified as hydrogen too. If the same spectral line is identified in both spectra—but at different wavelengths—then the <b>redshift</b> can be calculated using the table below. Determining the <b>redshift</b> of an object in this way requires a frequency- or wavelength-range. In order to calculate the <b>redshift</b> one has to know the wavelength of the emitted light in the rest frame of the source, in other words, the wavelength that would be measured by an observer located adjacent to and comoving with the source. Since in astronomical applications this measurement cannot be done directly, because that would require travelling to the distant star of interest, the method using spectral lines described here is used instead. Redshifts cannot be calculated by looking at unidentified features whose rest-frame frequency is unknown, or with a spectrum that is featureless or white noise (random fluctuations in a spectrum).|$|E
40|$|The {{observed}} {{absence of}} quasar <b>redshifts</b> larger than 3. 53 is erroneously attributed to Richard Green and myself in "A boundary for the quasars" (Research News, 22 Jan., p. 388).

40|$|We use {{extensive}} multiwavelength photometric {{data from}} the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey to estimate photometric <b>redshifts</b> for a sample of 434 galaxies with spectroscopic <b>redshifts</b> in the Chandra Deep Field-South. Using the Bayesian method, which incorporates redshift/magnitude priors, we estimate photometric <b>redshifts</b> for galaxies in the range 18 <R-AB< 25. 5, giving an rms scatter ς[&UDelta;z/(1 +z(spec)) ]&LE; 0. 11. The outlier fraction is less than 10 %, with the outlier-clipped rms being 0. 047. We examine the accuracy of photometric <b>redshifts</b> for several special subclasses of objects. The results for extremely red objects are more accurate than those for the sample as a whole, with ς= 0. 051 and very few outliers (3 %). Photometric <b>redshifts</b> for active galaxies, identified from their X-ray emission, have a dispersion of ς= 0. 104, with 10 % outlier fraction, similar to that for normal galaxies.

5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between a <b>redshift</b> in cosmological context as compared to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a local Doppler-effect <b>redshift.</b> Rather than cosmological redshifts being {{a consequence of the}} relative velocities that are subject to the laws of special relativity (and thus subject to the rule that no two locally separated objects can have relative velocities with respect to each other faster than the speed of light), the photons instead increase in wavelength and <b>redshift</b> because of a global feature of the spacetime metric through which they are traveling. One interpretation of this effect is the idea that space itself is expanding. Due to the expansion increasing as distances increase, the distance between two remote galaxies can increase at more than 3 m/s, but this does not imply that the galaxies move faster than the speed of light at their present location (which is forbidden by Lorentz covariance).|$|E
