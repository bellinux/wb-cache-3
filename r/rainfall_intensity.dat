2500|$|With {{surface water}} {{resources}} of 20 billion m3 (BCM) per year, of which 12 BCM are groundwater recharge, water {{resources in the}} Dominican Republic (DR) could be considered abundant. But irregular spatial and seasonal distribution, coupled with high consumption in irrigation and urban water supply, translates into water scarcity. Rapid economic growth and increased urbanization have also affected environmental quality and placed strains on the DR’s water resources base. In addition, the DR is exposed {{to a number of}} natural hazards, such as hurricanes, storms, floods, Drought, earthquakes, and fires. Global climate change is expected to induce permanent climate shocks to the Caribbean region, which will likely affect the DR in the form of sea level rise, higher surface air and sea temperatures, extreme weather events (such as tropical storms and hurricanes), increased <b>rainfall</b> <b>intensity</b> (leading to both more frequent and severe flooding) and more frequent and more severe [...] "El Niño-like" [...] conditions.|$|E

40|$|Changes in the {{intensity}} of precipitation {{as a result of}} global warming are expected to be especially pronounced in the tropics. The impact of changing <b>rainfall</b> <b>intensities</b> on groundwater recharge remains, however, unclear. Analysis of a recently compiled data set of coincidental, daily observations of rainfall and groundwater levels remote from abstraction for four stations in the Upper Nile Basin over the period 1999 – 2008 shows that the magnitude of observed recharge events is better related to the sum of heavy rainfalls, exceeding a threshold of 10 mm day− 1, than to that of all daily rainfall events. Consequently, projected increases in <b>rainfall</b> <b>intensities</b> as a result of global warming may promote rather than restrict groundwater recharge in similar environments of the tropics. Further monitoring and research are required to test the robustness of these findings, but the evidence presented is consistent with recent modelling highlighting the importance of explicitly considering changing <b>rainfall</b> <b>intensities</b> in the assessment of climate change impacts on groundwater recharge...|$|R

The rainfall model of DryMOD makes optimal use of spatially disaggregated Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) datasets to simulate hourly <b>rainfall</b> <b>intensities</b> at a spatial resolution of 1 -km. Regional-scale applications of the model in seasonal catchments in Tunisia and Senegal characterize runoff and soil moisture distribution and dynamics in response to varying rainfall data inputs and soil properties.

40|$|Unpaved {{resource}} roads {{have the}} potential to produce large amounts of sediment and can negatively impact water quality and aquatic ecology. In order to better understand the dominant controls on sediment generation from unpaved resource roads, we did 23 large-scale rainfall simulation experiments on a road section in the Honna Watershed, Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, Canada. The experiments were performed with different <b>rainfall</b> <b>intensities</b> (4 - 52 mm/h), with and without traffic. Precipitation intensity was the dominant control on the amount of sediment generated from the road surface; the total mass of sediment increased linearly with precipitation intensity. The number of passages of loaded logging trucks during an experiment was the second most dominant control on the total amount of sediment generated from the road surface. Elevated sediment concentrations in road surface runoff persisted for 30 min following the passage of loaded logging trucks during low intensity (< 8 mm/h) rainfall events and for much shorter periods at higher <b>rainfall</b> <b>intensities.</b> The mass of sediment generated by the passage of a loaded truck increased with precipitation intensity. Passages of empty logging truck did not result in sediment pulses, except during very high <b>rainfall</b> <b>intensities.</b> Seven small-scale <b>rainfall</b> simulation experiments on other parts of the road, however, highlight the large spatial variability in sediment production from the road surface, suggesting additional experiments are required to better describe and predict sediment production from different road sections. © 2014.
