The coal company stayed quiet, and {{when the time came}} to renew the health care and <b>retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> plans for its workers, Pittston refused. The refusal to renew the contract left about 1,500 people without health care. These people were not just miners employed by Pittston, but also families, widows, and disabled miners in the Virginia area.|$|E
5|$|By 1987 Pittston Coal {{had dropped}} {{from being the}} seventh largest coal {{operator}} in the United States to the 15th, and coal production was at an all-time low. The Pittston Coal Company had worked with the Bituminous Coal Operators (BCOA), which regulated health and retirement benefits offered to Pittston workers. The Pittston mines continued to lose money, though, and in 1987 the Pittston Coal Company terminated its contract with the BCOA to establish its own health and <b>retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> contract with the UMWA. Through collective bargaining, the UMWA and the Pittston Coal Company established two different retirement plans for the miners: one for those who retired before 1974 and one for those who retired after 1974, {{in the hopes that}} this would help the company gain a profit.|$|E
25|$|Prior to April 2006 schemes were 'approved' by HMRC {{rather than}} registered. Approval placed certain {{limits on the}} {{benefits}} which could be provided, {{which led to a}} growth of 'unapproved' (i.e. without the generous tax treatment) retirement arrangements – these unapproved schemes were commonly distinguished by reference to their funding status (funded unapproved <b>retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> schemes FURBS and unfunded unapproved <b>retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> schemes UURBS).|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that employers {{determine whether or not}} their employees receive <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> and the type and amount of any benefits that are received. This belief is mistaken. While sponsorship of a retirement plan is a voluntary choice {{on the part of the}} sponsoring employer and the sponsoring employer directly controls the type of plan and the level of benefits provided, the employer 2 ̆ 7 s choices on these matters are controlled by its employees 2 ̆ 7 preferences for different forms of compensation. An employer must spend the funds available for employee compensation so as to provide its employees with those forms of compensation that the employees value most highly. An employer includes <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> in its employees 2 ̆ 7 compensation packages when the employees prefer those benefits to other forms of compensation. In addition, in the long run, employees bear the costs of their <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits.</b> These facts mean that employees receive the <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> that they want and are willing to pay for. This conclusion undercuts the foundation of much of the law that regulates employees 2 ̆ 7 <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits,</b> which includes the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (2 ̆ 2 ERISA 2 ̆ 2) and portions of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, these laws are intended to enhance the quality of <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> and to increase the levels of <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> received by employees, particularly by nonhighly compensated employees. Retirement plan law attempts to accomplish these purposes by requiring that <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> be provided on certain specified terms and to certain categories of employees. Mandatory enhancements in the quality of <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> increase the costs of the benefits; since employees must pay for this enhanced quality, fewer employees, especially lower-paid employees, pay for and receive <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits.</b> Therefore, qualitative regulation of <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> tends to restrict the benefits to higher-paid employees. Requirements that benefits be provided to employees who are unwilling to bear the costs of the benefits ultimately have the perverse effect of decreasing the <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> of nonhighly compensated employees. In a voluntary retirement plan system, legal rules cannot compel employees to buy more and better <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> than they want. ERISA and the retirement plan provisions of the Code tend to reduce the levels of <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> received by employees generally and by nonhighly compensated employees in particular...|$|R

25|$|On July 22, 2008, the Social Security Administration {{introduced}} a new online benefits estimator. A worker who has enough Social Security credits to qualify for benefits, but who is not currently receiving benefits {{on his or her}} own Social Security record and who is not a Medicare beneficiary, can obtain an estimate of the <b>retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> that will be provided, for different assumptions about age at retirement. This process is done by opening a secure online account called my Social Security. For retirees who have non FICA or SECA taxed wages the rules get complicated and probably require additional help.|$|E
25|$|If {{a worker}} covered by Social Security dies, a {{surviving}} spouse can receive survivors' benefits. In some instances, survivors' benefits are available {{even to a}} divorced spouse. A father or mother with minor or disabled children {{in his or her}} care can receive benefits which are not actuarially reduced. The earliest age for a non-disabled widow(er)'s benefit is age 60. The benefit is equal to the worker's basic <b>retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> (PIA) (reduced if the deceased was receiving reduced benefits) for spouses who are at, or older than, normal retirement age. If the surviving spouse starts benefits before normal retirement age, there is an actuarial reduction. If the worker earned delayed retirement credits by waiting to start benefits after their normal retirement age, the surviving spouse will have those credits applied to their benefit.|$|E

500|$|Corzine {{had long}} insisted that state {{employees}} must bear {{part of the}} cost of their health benefits after retirement. As of July 1, 2007, in agreements with the Communications Workers of America, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, active State employees in those unions (as well as certain other non-union employees) are now required to contribute 1.5% of their salary to offset health care costs. State and local employees’ contributions to the two largest pension systems increased by 10%, from 5% to 5.5% of their annual salaries and increased the <b>retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> age for new public employees, from 55 to 60 years. In 2008, Corzine approved a law that increased the retirement age from 60 to 62, required that government workers and teachers earn $7,500 per year to qualify for a pension, eliminated Lincoln's Birthday as a state worker holiday, allowed the state to offer incentives not to take health insurance and required municipal employees work 20 hours per week to get health benefits.|$|E

2500|$|The current Social Security formula used in {{calculating the}} benefit level (primary {{insurance}} amount or PIA) is progressive vis-à-vis lower average salaries. Anyone {{who worked in}} OASDI covered employment and other retirement would be entitled to both the alternative non-OASDI pension and an Old Age <b>retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> from Social Security. Because of their limited time working in OASDI covered employment the sum of their covered salaries times inflation factor divided by 420 months yields a low adjusted indexed monthly salary over 35 years, AIME. The progressive nature of the PIA formula would in effect allow these workers to also get a slightly higher Social Security Benefit percentage on this low average salary. Congress passed in 1983 the Windfall Elimination Provision to minimize Social Security benefits for these recipients. The basic provision {{is that the first}} salary bracket, $0–791/month (2013) has its normal benefit percentage of 90% reduced to 40–90%—see Social Security for the exact percentage.

2500|$|Newly elected President Fernando de la Rúa {{appointed}} San Isidro Mayor Melchor Posse as interim Director General of ANSES in January 2000. President de la Rúa transferred ANSES {{from the}} Economy Ministry to the Labor Ministry. The agency was near insolvency {{as a result}} of a 40% fall in contributions since the inaugural of the private AFJP system, a new recession, and mounting lawsuits. Rulings favoring retirees had cost ANSES us$1.4 billion from 1995 to 1999, and us$2.1 billion in 2000, alone. The President placed ANSES under Federal intervention in November in preparation for his proposed abolition of the agency in favor of the private AFJP system. Posse resigned and was succeeded by former Tucumán Province Congressman Martín Campero. The worsening economic crisis prompted President de la Rúa's July 10, 2001, [...] "zero deficit" [...] decree, which led to a 13% cut in public sector wages and pensions alike. Campero resigned, and was succeeded on an interim basis by Douglas Lyall.

2500|$|The spousal <b>retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> is {{one-half}} the PIA benefit {{amount of}} their spouse {{or their own}} earned benefits, whichever is higher, if they both retire at [...] "normal" [...] retirement ages. Only after the working spouse applies for retirement benefits may the non-working spouse apply for spousal retirement benefits. The spousal benefit is the PIA times an [...] "early-retirement factor" [...] if the spouse is younger than the [...] "normal" [...] full retirement age. The early-retirement factor is 50% minus 25/36 of 1% per month for the first 36 months and 5/12 of 1% for each additional month earlier than the [...] "normal" [...] full retirement date. This typically works out to between 50% and 32.5% of the primary workers PIA benefit. There is no increase for starting spousal benefits after normal retirement age. This can occur {{if there is a}} married couple in which the younger person is the only worker and is more than 5 years younger. Any current spouse is eligible, and divorced or former spouses are eligible for spousal benefits if the marriage lasted for at least 10 years.

2500|$|Some federal, state, {{local and}} {{education}} government employees pay no Social Security but {{have their own}} retirement, disability systems that nearly always pay much better retirement and disability benefits than Social Security. These plans typically requires vesting—working for 5–10 years for the same employer before becoming eligible for retirement. But their retirement typically only depends on {{the average of the}} best 3–10 years salaries times some retirement factor (typically 0.875%-3.0%) times years employed. This <b>retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> can be a [...] "reasonably good" [...] (75–85% of salary) retirement at close to the monthly salary they were last employed at. For example, if a person joined the University of California retirement system at age 25 and worked for 35 years they could receive 87.5% (2.5% × 35) of their average highest three year salary with full medical coverage at age 60. Police and firemen who joined at 25 and worked for 30 years could receive 90% (3.0% × 30) of their average salary and full medical coverage at age 55. These retirements have cost of living adjustments (COLA) applied each year but are limited to a maximum average income of $350,000/year or less. Spousal survivor benefits are available at 100–67% of the primary benefits rate for 8.7% to 6.7% reduction in retirement benefits, respectively. UCRP retirement and disability plan benefits are funded by contributions from both members and the university (typically 5% of salary each) and by the compounded investment earnings of the accumulated totals. These contributions and earnings are held in a trust fund that is invested. The retirement benefits are much more generous than Social Security but are believed to be actuarially sound. The main difference between state and local government sponsored retirement systems and Social Security is that the state and local retirement systems use compounded investments that are usually heavily weighted in the stock market securities—which historically have returned more than 7.0%/year on average despite some years with losses. Short term federal government investments may be [...] "more" [...] secure but pay much lower average percentages. Nearly all other federal, state and local retirement systems work in a similar fashion with different benefit retirement ratios. Some plans are now combined with Social Security and are [...] "piggy backed" [...] on top of Social Security benefits. For example, the current Federal Employees Retirement System, which covers the vast majority of federal civil service employees hired after 1986, combines Social Security, a modest defined-benefit pension (1.1% per year of service) and the defined-contribution Thrift Savings Plan.|$|E
