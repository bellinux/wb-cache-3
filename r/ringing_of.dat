5|$|On 13 June 1940 the <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> {{church bells}} was banned; {{henceforth}} {{they would only}} be rung by the military or the police to warn that an invasion—generally meaning by parachutists—was in progress.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the mayoral}} inaugurations, the {{marketplace}} was also the setting for other public events, particularly mourning processions on the deaths of monarchs, coronation celebrations, royal birthdays and celebrations of military victories. Firework displays and bonfires would be held on these occasions, accompanied by the local militia firing volleys and the <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> the bells of the surrounding churches, while local residents and shopkeepers would illuminate their windows with lit candles. Often, particularly in the 18thcentury, temporary triumphal arches would be erected beside the Guildhall. Free beer would traditionally be distributed at these events, which would on occasion degenerate into drunken disorder.|$|E

5|$|Details of the {{assassination}} attempt were allegedly known by the principal Jesuit of England, Father Henry Garnet. Although {{he was convicted of}} treason and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how much he really knew of the plot. As its existence was revealed to him through confession, Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the absolute confidentiality of the confessional. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during King James I's reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as the <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> church bells, which have evolved into the Bonfire Night of today.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Gifu {{absorbed the}} former post town of Kanō, greatly {{increasing}} its land area. Kanō had many traditional industries, which helped improve Gifu's overall industrial strength. With the neighboring city of Kakamigahara {{serving as an}} aeronautics center for Japan, Gifu was a large industrial center during World War II, including a downtown manufacturing sector. As a result, Gifu {{was the target of}} heavy firebombing by the United States Army Air Forces, culminating in the Gifu Air Raid of July 9, 1945, which resulted in 1,383 casualties (863 dead, 520 injured) and 20,426 buildings affected. Gifu commemorates these events each year on July 9, with the <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> the Peace Bell at each temple within the city. Its sister cities also take part in these events.|$|E
5|$|The Primera Junta {{was finally}} established. It was {{composed}} by president Cornelio Saavedra, members Manuel Alberti, Miguel de Azcuénaga, Manuel Belgrano, Juan José Castelli, Domingo Matheu and Juan Larrea, and secretaries Juan José Paso and Mariano Moreno. The rules governing it were {{roughly the same}} as those issued the day before, with the additional provisions that the Cabildo would watch over the members of the Junta and that the Junta itself would appoint replacements in case of vacancies. Saavedra spoke to the crowd, and then moved on to the Fort, among salvos of artillery and the <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> bells. Meanwhile, Cisneros dispatched a post rider to Córdoba, Argentina, to warn Santiago de Liniers about what had happened in Buenos Aires and to request military action against the Junta.|$|E
40|$|Perfect Gabriel filters {{of right}} ideals and their {{corresponding}} right <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> quotients have the desirable feature that every module of quotients is determined solely {{by the right}} <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> quotients. On the other hand, symmetric <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> quotients have a symmetry that mimics the commutative case. In this paper, we study <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> quotients that combine these two desirable properties. We define the symmetric versions of a right perfect <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> quotients and a right perfect Gabriel filter – the perfect symmetric <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> quotients and the perfect symmetric Gabriel filter and study their properties. Then we prove that the standard construction of the total right <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> quotients Q r tot(R) {{can be adapted to}} the construction of the largest perfect symmetric <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> quotients – the total symmetric <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> quotients Q σ tot (R).

40|$|This article deals {{mostly with}} the {{following}} question: when is the classical <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> quotients <b>of</b> a commutative <b>ring</b> a <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> stable range 1 ? We introduce the concepts <b>of</b> a <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> (von Neumann) regular range 1, a <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> semihereditary range 1, a <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> regular range 1, a semihereditary local ring, a regular local ring. We find relationships between the introduced classes <b>of</b> <b>rings</b> and known ones, in particular, it is established that a commutative indecomposable almost clean ring is a regular local ring. A commutative any <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> idempotent regular range 1 is an almost clean ring. It is shown that any commutative indecomposable almost clean Bezout ring is an Hermite ring, any commutative semihereditary ring is a <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> idempotent regular range 1. The classical <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> quotients of a commutative Bezout ring is a (von Neumann) regular local ring {{if and only if}} R is a commutative semihereditary local ring...|$|R
5|$|The sonorous {{sound of}} the bell was also used to warn of {{impending}} typhoons and as a general alert. Because the <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> a temple bell could be heard over considerable distances, it was also sometimes used for other signalling purposes; there are records of temple bells being used for military communication from {{as far back as}} the Genpei War (1180–1185 CE). Smaller versions were subsequently cast for battlefield use, as the large temple bells were too heavy and unwieldy to transport. These smaller bonshō were used primarily as alarms to warn of enemy attacks; commands were given using drums and conches.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Saladin's reign as sultan in Egypt, upon the encouragement of his adviser, Qadi al-Fadil, Christians were prohibited from employment in the fiscal administration, but various Ayyubid emirs continued to allow Christians to serve in their posts. A number of other regulations were imposed, including the bans on alcohol consumption, religious processions, and the <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> church bells. Conversion of formerly high-ranking Christians and their families to Islam took place throughout the early period of Ayyubid rule. According to historian Yaakov Lev, the persecution of non-Muslims had some permanent effects on them, but nonetheless, the effects were local and contained. To manage Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids permitted Europeans—mainly Italians, but also French and Catalans—to settle in Alexandria in large numbers. However, {{in the aftermath of}} the Fifth Crusade, 3,000 merchants from the area were arrested or expelled.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{nations were}} {{entered in the}} tandem competition, {{and in the first}} round, they were drawn with Germany and South Africa, who fielded their silver medallist pairing of Tom Shardelow and Ray Robinson from the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. The Australians made their move too early and led at the <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> the bell {{at the start of the}} last lap, but they were {{overhauled}} well before the line as they faded in the final straight. Browne and Marchant were given another chance in the repechage round later in the same day. The Australians lead for three quarters of the distance, but were overhauled by their Czechoslovakian opponent in the final metres and were defeated in a photo finish. This would normally have meant that the Australians would have been eliminated, however the final repechage between the Soviet Union and the Germans resulted in a tangle, resulting in a heavy pile-up. Neither teams finished the race, but the Soviets were hospitalised. The cycling officials decided that the bruised Germans would be forced to compete in a repechage sequel against the losers in the previous repechages to qualify. This allowed the United States and the Australians a reprieve.|$|E

5|$|The Lincoln-Liberty Building, {{completed}} in 1932, {{was intended to}} partly house a large men's department store and offices. The building's cornerstone was set on October 1, 1932 with a ceremony attended by William L. Nevin and Wanamaker executives from New York City, Paris and London. The Wanamaker Men's Store opened on October 12, 1932, with four Wanamaker buglers blowing a reveille and the <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> the building's Founders Bell. Opening during the Great Depression, Nevin said the new building {{was a sign of}} the store's faith that the economy would improve. Intended to rival European department stores in size and selection, the men's store ordered US$2,000,000 worth of merchandise and was the largest store {{of its kind in the}} world. As early as 1939 there were rumors the men's store would close, but Wanamaker's would not close the store unless a replacement tenant would agree to rent the space. When a new tenant was ready to take the store's place in the 1950s, the men's store was relocated to the Wanamaker Building down the street.|$|E
5|$|The Octagon is also {{believed}} {{by some to}} be haunted by the spirits of African American slaves who once lived there. When the house held bells to summon servants, the spirits of the dead slaves would announce their presence by ringing these bells loudly. The ghostly bell ringing first occurred in the 1870s. General George D. Ramsay, Chief of Ordnance for the United States Army and commander of the Washington Arsenal in Washington, D.C., was attending a dinner at The Octagon when all the bells in the house began ringing. As Marian Gouverneur, wife of Samuel Laurence Gouverneur, Jr. (the first American consul in Foo Chow, China), related the story, General Ramsay seized the bell ropes to stop the bells from sounding, but to everyone's shock they did not stop ringing. Although Gouverneur's report was not made until 1911, the mysterious <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> the bells had been reported in 1874 and again in 1889, each time attributed to the spirits of dead slaves.|$|E

Using this, we prove that the <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> differential operators is left Noetherian if the condition is satisfied. Moreover we give some other conditions for the <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> differential operators being left Noetherian. Finally we conjecture necessary and sufficient conditions for the <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> differential operators being left Noetherian...|$|R
