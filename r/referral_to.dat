5|$|Hospices: While late <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> hospice is a {{much more}} {{prevalent}} problem than early referral, some hospice providers will hesitate to admit patients to hospice (or they may de-certify them from hospice too early) due to scrutiny from Medicare for patients deemed to be on hospice too long. After a patient has been on hospice for six months, Medicare is more aggressive in auditing the hospice for inappropriate payment of services. For some hospices this is simply not worth the trouble, and patients are screened very carefully prior to admission.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{document}} {{the number and}} pattern of psychiatric and psychosocial <b>referrals</b> <b>to</b> community resources by family physicians (FPs) and <b>to</b> determine whether <b>referral</b> practices correlate with physician variables. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of <b>referrals</b> by FPs <b>to</b> 34 key psychiatric and psychosocial community resources identified {{by a panel of}} FPs, psychiatric social workers, psychiatric nurses, public health nurses, and the local community information service. SETTING: Regional municipality of 434, 000 persons in Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven of 34 (79 %) community agencies identified 261 FPs who made 4487 <b>referrals</b> <b>to</b> participating agencies (range 0 to 65, median 15, mean 17. 19 +/- 13. 42). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of <b>referrals</b> <b>to</b> all agencies; variables, such as physician sex, school of graduation, year of graduation, and certificate status in the College of Family Physicians of Canada, related <b>to</b> <b>referral</b> patterns. RESULTS: <b>Referrals</b> <b>to</b> outpatient psychiatric clinics, support services, and general counseling services accounted for 96 % of all referrals. Physicians' average annual referral profile was as follows: 8. 6 patients to a support service, 6. 3 to an outpatient psychiatric service, 1. 6 to a counseling service, and 0. 46 to a substance abuse service. Referral profiles of individual physicians varied greatly. Female FPs made fewer referrals than male FPs to support services, but both made similar numbers of <b>referrals</b> <b>to</b> psychiatric, counseling, and substance abuse services. The more recent the year of graduation, the greater the number of <b>referrals</b> <b>to</b> psychiatric (r = 0. 158, P = 0. 0107) and counseling services (r = 0. 137, P = 0. 0272) and the higher the fraction of <b>referrals</b> <b>to</b> psychiatric services (r = 0. 286, P = 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: Family physicians in Hamilton-Wentworth made few <b>referrals</b> <b>to</b> psychiatric and psychosocial services. Only physician sex and year of graduation correlated significantly with numbers of referrals made. Recent graduates of both sexes made significantly more <b>referrals</b> <b>to</b> psychiatric clinics and counseling services than their older colleagues...|$|R

5|$|Similarities {{between the}} humerus of Hatzegopteryx and Quetzalcoatlus northropi have been noted; {{both have a}} long, smooth deltopectoral crest, and a {{thickened}} humeral head. These were initially {{the basis of the}} taxon's <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> the clade Azhdarchidae, but they are also similar enough to be a basis for the synonymy of Hatzegopteryx and Quetzalcoatlus. However, this is likely due to the relatively non-diagnostic nature of the humerus in giant azhdarchid taxonomy, and the lack of a detailed description for the elements of Q. northropi. However, the neck and jaw anatomy of Hatzegopteryx is quite clearly distinct from the smaller Q. sp., which warrants the retention of Hatzegopteryx as a taxon separate from Quetzalcoatlus.|$|E

Gray, whose time as chair was about to expire, deferred action on the report, saying that his adversarial relationship with Keating would make any action he took seem vindictive, and that instead the incoming chair should take over the decision. Meanwhile, Keating {{filed a lawsuit against}} the FHLBB, saying it had leaked confidential information about Lincoln. The new FHLBB chair was M. Danny Wall, who was more sympathetic to Keating and took no action on the report, saying its evidence was insufficient. In September 1987, the Lincoln investigation was removed from the San Francisco group and in May 1988, the FHLBB signed an agreement with Lincoln that included not going ahead with a criminal <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> the Department of Justice. In July 1988, a new audit of both Lincoln and American Continental began in Washington.|$|E
5|$|From 1983 to 1985, Cathy A. Paris, then a {{graduate}} student, gathered specimens of A.pedatum from non-serpentine soils in the Midwest and Vermont, and from serpentine soils in New England and Canada, for biosystematic analysis. In 1988, Paris and Michael D. Windham published {{the results of}} this analysis, revealing A.pedatum in North America to be a cryptic species complex. They showed that A.pedatum sensu lato included two well-distinguished diploid taxa, one found in the Eastern woodlands, and the other found both in the Western mountains and as a disjunct on serpentine in the East. However, not all of the serpentine disjuncts proved to belong to the Western taxon. Several of them, including most of the specimens in Vermont, were found to be tetraploid, forming a taxon distinguishable from the two diploids. Isozyme banding patterns suggested that the tetraploid had arisen by hybridization between the eastern subspecies of non-serpentine woodlands and the western and serpentine taxon, followed by a duplication of the hybrid genome through polyploidy (allowing the chromosomes to pair and restoring sexual fertility). This allotetraploid was also morphologically intermediate between the two taxa, although it more closely resembled the serpentine taxon (hence its <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> var.aleuticum before Paris's work). Paris formally described the tetraploid as a new species, A.viridimontanum, in 1991, and also separated the western and serpentine taxon from A.pedatum as the species A.aleuticum. The type specimen of A.viridimontanum was collected from a talus slope at the old asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain on August 28, 1985. The sequencing of several chloroplast DNA loci has revealed that the A.viridimontanum chloroplast genome most closely resembles that of A.aleuticum, suggesting that A.aleuticum was the maternal parent of A.viridimontanum.|$|E

5|$|Raskolnikov's dreams have a {{symbolic}} meaning, which suggests a psychological view. The {{dream of the}} mare being whipped has been suggested as the fullest single expression of the whole novel, symbolizing gratification and punishment, contemptible motives and contemptible society, depicting the nihilistic destruction of an unfit mare, the gratification therein, and Rodion's disgust and horror, {{as an example of}} his conflicted character. Raskolnikov's disgust and horror is central to the theme of his conflicted character, his guilty conscience, his contempt for society, his rationality of himself as an extraordinary man above greater society, holding authority to kill, and his concept of justified murder. His reaction is pivotal, provoking his first taking of life toward the rationalization of himself as above greater society. The dream is later mentioned when Raskolnikov talks to Marmeladov. Marmeladov's daughter, morally chaste and devout Sonya, must earn a living as a prostitute for their impoverished family, the result of his alcoholism. The dream is also a warning, foreshadowing an impending murder and holds several comparisons to his murder of the pawnbroker. The dream occurs after Rodion crosses a bridge leading out of the oppressive heat and dust of Petersburg and into the fresh greenness of the islands. This symbolizes a corresponding mental crossing, suggesting that Raskolnikov is returning to a state of clarity when he has the dream. In it, he returns to the innocence of his childhood and watches as a group of peasants beat an old mare to death. After Raskolnikov awakes, he reflects on it as a “such a hideous dream,” the same term he earlier used to describe his plot to kill the old woman (62). This diction draws a parallel between the two, suggesting that the child represents the part of him that clings to morality and watches horrified as another facet, represented by the peasants, is driven by hardship and isolation to become cold and unfeeling. The constant laughing of the peasants in the face of brutal slaughter reveals {{the extent to which they}} have been desensitized by their suffering, which is a reflection of Raskolnikov’s own condition. This interpretation is further supported by fact that the main peasant, Mikolka, feels that he has the right to kill the horse, linking his actions to Raskolnikov’s theory justifying murder for a select group of extraordinary men. The comparison between the cruel slaughter of the old mare and the plan to murder Alyona Ivanovna delineates the brutality of Raskolnikov’s crime, which is often downplayed by his habitual dehumanizing <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> the old woman as simply a “louse.” While awake, Raskolnikov’s view of the old woman is spiteful, defined by his tenacious belief in his extraordinary man theory. However, the dream acts as a conduit for Raskolnikov’s subconscious, and without the constraints of his theory the horrific nature of his crime becomes apparent. Therefore, in order for Raskolnikov to find redemption, he must ultimately renounce his theory.|$|E

25|$|In 2000 and 2006, Paleontologists around Octávio Mateus {{described}} a find from the Lourinhã Formation in Portugal {{as a new}} specimen of Ceratosaurus, consisting of an upper thigh bone, a shin bone, and several isolated teeth. The specimen provides evidence of a Portuguese theropod fauna similar in composition to the North American Morrison Formation: Besides Ceratosaurus, the researchers also noted the presence of Allosaurus and Torvosaurus in the Portuguese rocks. During the Late Jurassic, Europe had just been separated from North America by the still narrow Atlantic Ocean, and Portugal, {{as part of the}} Iberian Peninsula, was still separated from other parts of Europe. The similarity between the Portuguese and North American theropod fauna indicates the presence of a temporary land bridge, allowing for faunal interchange. The specimen was ascribed to the species Ceratosaurus dentisulcatus by Mateus and colleagues. A later review by Carrano and Sampson (2008) confirmed the <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> Ceratosaurus, but concluded that the <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> a specific species is not possible at present.|$|E
