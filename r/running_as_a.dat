5|$|In 1898, Lane, <b>running</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Democrat, {{was elected}} to the {{combined}} position of City and County Attorney, defeating California's sitting Attorney General, W. F. Fitzgerald, by 832votes in a year that otherwise saw most offices across the state fall to the Republicans. He was re-elected in 1899 and 1901.|$|E
5|$|Work from Wimbledon to South Merton was {{completed}} quickly, so that services could begin <b>running</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single-track operation on 7 July 1929.

5|$|En {{route to}} Athens, Revithi {{encountered}} a male runner along the road. He gave her money and advised her {{to run the}} marathon to become famous, and, consequently, earn money or more easily find a job. After this discussion Revithi decided to run the race: she had enjoyed long-distance <b>running</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> child, and believed she could beat the male competitors.|$|E

5|$|Heartbleed is a {{security}} bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, {{which is a}} widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed may be exploited {{regardless of whether the}} vulnerable OpenSSL instance is <b>running</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> TLS server or client. It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension, thus the bug's name derives from heartbeat. The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed.|$|E
5|$|Hume often wrote editorials, {{engaged in}} litigation, appealed to legislators, and waged {{political}} campaigns {{to protect his}} business interests. <b>Running</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Republican, he was twice elected, in 1900 and 1902, to represent Coos and Curry counties in the Oregon House of Representatives. According to his biographer, he voted self-interest first and conservative positions second, resisting Populist ideas in vogue at the time.|$|E
5|$|In response, Tyler, already {{ejected from}} the Whig party, quickly began to {{organize}} a third party in hopes of inducing the Democrats to embrace a pro-expansionist platform. By <b>running</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> third-party candidate, Tyler threatened to siphon off pro-annexation Democratic voters; Democratic party disunity would mean the election of Henry Clay, a staunchly anti-Texas Whig. Pro-annexation delegates among southern Democrats, with assistance {{from a number of}} northern delegates, blocked anti-expansion candidate Martin Van Buren at the convention, which instead nominated the pro-expansion champion of Manifest Destiny, James K. Polk of Tennessee. Polk unified his party under the banner of Texas and Oregon acquisition.|$|E

5|$|<b>Running</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Republican, Willis lost a bid {{to become}} city {{attorney}} of Ashland in 1905. In 1916, he ran for {{a seat on the}} Kentucky Court of Appeals, but lost in the primary to Flem D. Sampson, who {{went on to win the}} general election. He took a brief leave of politics and served as an appeals agent for the Selective Service System during World War I. In 1918, he won the election for Ashland city solicitor and served in that position until 1922. Beginning in 1922, he served on the State Board of Bar Examiners, a position he held until 1928.|$|E
5|$|Since the 2012 elections, Johnson has {{continued}} to criticize the Obama administration on various issues. In an article for The Guardian, Johnson called on United States Attorney General Eric Holder to let individual states legalize marijuana. In a Google Hangout hosted by Johnson in June 2013, he criticized the US government's lack of transparency and due process {{in regards to the}} NSA's domestic surveillance programs. He also said that he would not rule out <b>running</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Republican again in the future.|$|E
5|$|The United States has {{operated}} under a two-party system {{for most of}} its history. For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the major parties have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican Party, founded in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former president Theodore Roosevelt, <b>running</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Progressive in 1912—has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. The President and Vice-president are elected through the Electoral College system.|$|E

5|$|William Howard Taft (September 15, 1857 – March 8, 1930) {{served as}} the 27th President of the United States (1909–1913) and as the 10th Chief Justice of the United States (1921–1930), {{the only person to}} have held both offices. Taft was elected {{president}} in 1908, the chosen successor of Theodore Roosevelt, but was defeated for re-election by Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after Roosevelt split the Republican vote by <b>running</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> third-party candidate. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding appointed Taft to be chief justice, a position in which he served until a month before his death.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{opponents in}} the general {{election}} were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and independent Joseph L. Kennedy (no relation to the Kennedy family). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, he was <b>running</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Republican in a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Year's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics. No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but closed the gap in the early weeks of January.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{election}} loss Dosanjh returned to practicing law {{and let his}} party membership lapse. There had been speculation dating back to October 2002 that Dosanjh was interested in joining the Liberal Party of Canada. New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton approached Dosanjh in 2003 {{to see if he}} was interested in <b>running</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> federal candidate but Dosanjh refused. In March 2004, with a federal election expected in the spring or summer, Prime Minister Paul Martin approached Dosanjh to be a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada. Dosanjh agreed and Martin appointed him to Vancouver South over two other nomination candidates while announcing Dosanjh as part of a team of BC star candidates along with economist David Emerson, union leader Dave Haggard, community activist Shirley Chan and Liberal party organizer Bill Cunningham. The advertising of Dosanjh emphasized the party's socially progressive aspect. In the June election Dosanjh won his riding with 44.5% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Humphrey {{first entered}} presidential {{politics}} in 1952 <b>running</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> favorite son candidate in Minnesota. In 1960, he mounted a full-scale run, winning primaries in South Dakota and Washington D.C., but ultimately lost the Democratic nomination to future President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, Humphrey was tapped as the running mate of President Lyndon Johnson, {{who went on}} to win in a landslide victory over Republican Barry Goldwater. As Vice President, Humphrey oversaw turbulent times in America, including race riots and growing frustration and anger over the large number of casualties in the Vietnam War. President Johnson's popularity had plummeted as the election grew closer.|$|E
5|$|The 100 Club, in the {{basement}} of No.100, has been <b>running</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> live music venue since 24 October 1942. It was thought to be safe from bombing threats due to its underground location, and played host to jazz musicians, including Glenn Miller. It was renamed the London Jazz Club in 1948, and subsequently the Humphrey Lyttelton Club after Lyttelton took over the lease in the 1950s. Louis Armstrong played at the venue during this time. It became a key venue for the trad jazz revival, hosting gigs by Chris Barber and Acker Bilk. It was renamed the 100 Club in 1964 after Roger Horton bought a stake in the venue, adding an alcohol licence for the first time. The venue hosted gigs by several British blues bands, including the Who, the Kinks and the Animals. It was an important venue for punk rock in the UK and hosted the first British punk festival on 21 September 1976, featuring the Sex Pistols, the Damned and the Buzzcocks.|$|E
