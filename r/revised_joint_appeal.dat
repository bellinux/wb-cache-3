40|$|Sea-level return periods are {{estimated}} at 18 {{sites around the}} English Channel using: (i) the annual maxima method; (ii) the r-largest method; (iii) the joint probability method; and (iv) the <b>revised</b> <b>joint</b> probability method. Tests are undertaken to determine how sensitive these four methods are to three factors which may significantly influence the results; (a) {{the treatment of the}} long-term trends in extreme sea level; (b) the relative magnitudes of the tidal and non-tidal components of sea level; and (c) the frequency, length and completeness of the available data. Results show that unless sea-level records with lengths of at least 50 years are used, {{the way in which the}} long-term trends is handled in the different methods can lead to significant differences in the estimated return levels. The direct methods (i. e. methods i and ii) underestimate the long (> 20 years) period return levels when the astronomical tidal variations of sea level (relative to a mean of zero) are about twice that of the non-tidal variations. The performance of each of the four methods is assessed using prediction errors (the difference between the return periods of the observed maximum level at each site and the corresponding data range). Finally, return periods, estimated using the four methods, are compared with estimates from the spatial <b>revised</b> <b>joint</b> probability method along the UK south coast and are found to be significantly larger at most sites along this coast, due to the comparatively short records originally used to calibrate the model in this area. The <b>revised</b> <b>joint</b> probability method is found to have the lowest prediction errors at most sites analysed and this method is recommended for application wherever possible. However, no method can compensate for poor data...|$|R

40|$|Coastal {{populations are}} {{growing at a}} rapid pace and this is being {{accompanied}} by an increased investment in infrastructure at the coastal zone. Combined with this is the concern of enhanced coastal flooding due to rising sea levels and climate change. Hence, it is of utmost practical importance that probabilities of current and future extreme sea level are accurately evaluated so that the changing flood risk can be assessed and defences upgraded where appropriate. This thesis tests the hypothesis that changes in extreme still water level can be approximated by just adding changes in mean sea level to current return levels estimated from measured data, for the English Channel region. A data archaeology exercise has been undertaken to extend the sea level records along the UK south coast. This exercise increased the sea level data set for this region by 173 years. These new records have been analysed along with existing data to determine rates of change in both mean and extreme sea level, and to estimate probabilities of extreme sea level using four statistical methods: (i) the annual maxima method; (ii) its extension to the rlargest annual events method; (iii) the joint probabilities method; and (iv) the <b>revised</b> <b>joint</b> probabilities method. Relative mean sea-level trends vary by between 0. 8 and 2. 3 mm/yr around the Channel over the 20 th century. These trends have been estimated using a new approach, in which the coherent {{part of the sea}} level variability around the UK is defined as a single index. This is then subtracted from the sea level records prior to fitting trends. The recent high rates of mean sea-level rise observed over the last decade are not unusual on a century scale context. The tidal and non-tidal components of sea level, along with tide-surge interaction, have been separately analysed for trends before analysing variations in extreme sea levels. There is evidence for an increase in extreme sea levels during the 20 th century, but at rates not significantly different to that of mean sea level. There is no evidence of a longterm increase in storm count, duration or intensity. The <b>revised</b> <b>joint</b> probabilities method is found to out perform the other statistical methods, in terms of prediction errors. Results confirm that changes in extreme sea levels during the 20 th century can be estimated, to an accuracy of 0. 1 m, by simply adding mean sea level changes to return levels estimated from measured data. The return levels should be estimated using the <b>revised</b> <b>joint</b> probabilities method wherever possible. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Cold cure two-part epoxy {{adhesives}} {{were tested}} in aluminum joints to investigate their viability for use in an ultralight aircraft. The joints consisted of Alclad 2024 -T 3 aluminum sheets adhesively bonded to extruded 6061 -T 6511 aluminum, and are part of low-load-bearing members required to carry a minimum load of 175 lbs. /ft. or 14. 58 lbs. /in. The Alclad 2024 -T 3 and 6061 -T 6511 aluminum were prepared by sanding with 80 grit abrasive paper, the surface was cleaned with acetone to remove surface contaminants, rinsed with distilled water, and dried using paper towels. Once the surface was prepared, the test coupons were assembled {{using one of the}} three selected adhesives (Loctite E- 05 MR, Loctite E- 20 HP, and 3 M 420 DP) which were applied using a hand operated applicator gun with mixing nozzle. The samples were then placed on a jig to hold them securely while the adhesives cured. The samples were allowed to cure for several days. The samples were then loaded in tension to failure using an Instron tensile tester. The Loctite E- 20 HP adhesive achieved the average highest strengths of 1378. 53 ± 360. 25 lbs. /in. The scatter is believed to be due to excessive adhesive buildup {{around the edges of the}} joint and due to variations in the machined parts. Due to its high strength, the Loctite E- 20 HP was used in testing 30 additional samples, with a <b>revised</b> <b>joint</b> design, to try and minimize scatter.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{compare the}} {{relative}} accuracy {{of cardiovascular disease}} risk prediction methods based on equations derived from the Framingham heart study.  DESIGN—Risk factor data were collected prospectively from subjects being evaluated by their primary care physicians for prevention of cardiovascular disease. Projected cardiovascular risks were calculated for each patient with the Framingham equations, and also estimated from the risk tables and charts {{based on the same}} equations.  SETTING— 12 primary care practices (46  doctors) in Birmingham.  PATIENTS— 691 subjects aged 30 - 70 years.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the Framingham based risk tables and charts for treatment thresholds based on projected cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease risk.  RESULTS— 59 subjects (8. 5 %) had projected 10  year coronary heart disease risks ⩾  30 %, and 291  (42. 1 %) had risks ⩾  15 %. At equivalent projected risk levels (10  year coronary heart disease ⩾  30 % and five year cardiovascular disease ⩾  20 %), the original Sheffield tables and those from New Zealand have the same sensitivities (40. 0 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 26. 6 % to 57. 8 % v 41. 2 %, 95 % CI 28. 7 % to 57. 3 %) and specificities (98. 6 %, 95 % CI 97. 2 % to 99. 3 % v 99. 7 %, 95 % CI 98. 8 % to 100 %). Modifications to the Sheffield tables improve sensitivity (91. 4 %, 95 % CI 81. 3 % to 96. 9 %) but reduce specificity (95. 8 %, 95 % CI 93. 9 % to 97. 3 %). The <b>revised</b> <b>joint</b> British recommendations' charts have high specificity (98. 7 %, 95 % CI 97. 5 % to 99. 5 %) and good sensitivity (84. 7 %, 95 % CI 71. 0 % to 93. 0 %).  CONCLUSIONS—The <b>revised</b> <b>joint</b> British recommendations charts appear to have the best combination of sensitivity and specificity for use in primary care patients.    Keywords: Framingham study; cardiovascular risk assessmen...|$|R

40|$|International audienceNewly exposed {{concepts}} of POT declustering (Bernardara et al., 2014) within the GPD-Poisson model {{are applied to}} the joint probability of tide and surge for determining extreme sea levels, as {{a variation of the}} <b>Revised</b> <b>Joint</b> Probability Method (RJPM, Tawn and Vassie, 1989). A mixture model is proposed for the meteorological residual (surge) component with a non-parametric (empirical) density for the bulk values and parametric models for both the lower and upper tails. In particular, a distinction is made between values observed at regular time steps, called sequential values, and the clusters of extreme values, or events, on which the statistical extrapolations are performed. The sea level distribution is obtained by convolution of the tide and surge density functions. Confidence intervals are also proposed. This model is applied to the case study of Brest, France using both hourly and high water values. Two methods for handling tide–surge interaction are presented and discussed and a comparison with a direct approach is made...|$|R
