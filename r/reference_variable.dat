In contrast with other theories {{of psychology and}} behavior, which assume that behavior {{is a function of}} perception — that perceptual inputs determine or cause behavior — PCT postulates that an organism's behavior is a means of controlling its perceptions. In contrast with engineering control theory, the <b>reference</b> <b>variable</b> for each negative feedback control loop in a control hierarchy is set from within the system (the organism), rather than by an external agent changing the setpoint of the controller.

50|$|Unlike in C++, {{objects in}} Java are always {{accessed}} indirectly through references. Objects are never created implicitly but instead are always passed or assigned by a <b>reference</b> <b>variable.</b> (Methods in Java are always pass by value, however, {{it is the}} value of the <b>reference</b> <b>variable</b> that is being passed.) The Java Virtual Machine manages garbage collection so that objects are cleaned up after they are no longer reachable. There is no automatic way to copy any given object in Java.|$|E
30|$|This example, while {{simplified}} for {{the sake}} of illustration, highlights the dynamics of how a system of smart institutions might operate, and the crucial importance of their steering institutions in setting the <b>reference</b> <b>variables</b> and in determining how these <b>reference</b> <b>variables</b> respond to social feedback. As the process unfolds, steering institutions may learn not only how to modify the <b>reference</b> <b>variables,</b> but also the efficacy of the signal generation process. Institutional analysis becomes specifically important in this control-theoretic conceptualization of smart institutions for the precise purpose that it answers the question of how information is processed to generate values for a large set of actuating signals that, in turn, help make the output of the overall system respond to the <b>reference</b> <b>variables.</b> This focus provided to the analysis of real-world institutions is especially useful for the tractability it imparts.|$|R

50|$|William T. Powers (August 29, 1926 - May 24, 2013) was an {{independent}} scholar of experimental and theoretical psychology {{who developed the}} perceptual control theory (PCT) model of behavior as the control of perception. PCT demonstrates and explains how rather than controlling their behavioral outputs, living things vary their behavior as the means of controlling their sensory inputs (perceptions). Living control systems differ from those specified by Engineering control theory (a thermostat is a simple example), for which the reference value (setpoint) for control is specified outside the system by {{what is called the}} controller, whereas in living systems the <b>reference</b> <b>variable</b> for each control loop in a control hierarchy is generated within the system, usually as a function of error output from a higher-level system or systems. Powers and his students and colleagues in diverse fields have developed many demonstrations of negative feedback control, and computer models or simulations that replicate observed and measured behavior of living systems (human and animal, individuals and groups of individuals) with a very high degree of fidelity (0.95 or better), and corresponding control structures have been demonstrated neurophysiologically.|$|E

30|$|Indeed, the low-powered {{actuating}} {{signals are}} incapable of generating an output {{on their own and}} rely on the galvanizing force of high-powered signals produced by actuators to achieve this. This allows us to concretize the meaning of effectiveness of a social, economic or political institution and to distinguish between weak and strong institutions. We investigate this further in Sect.  3.3. The impact of the output on the <b>reference</b> <b>variables</b> is then assessed by members of the society, and once this information is processed, it is transmitted to the steering institutions and considered by them. Thus, there exists the idea of feedback, or metering, which is an evaluation process that produces a set of feedback variables (z_t). It is worth noting that this characterization of z_t as an evaluation is broad enough to incorporate not only hard data and statistics, but also social commentary and opinion. We imagine feedback in its most general form and allow it to encompass any information that can influence the design of the <b>reference</b> <b>variables.</b> Depending on how the subjective performance of the system, as expressed by z_t, compares with the <b>reference</b> <b>variables</b> (w_t), the steering institutions design the <b>reference</b> <b>variables</b> for the next period (w_t+ 1), and the process repeats itself.|$|R

30|$|We can now see how {{the various}} {{elements}} in our model for smart institutions integrate for a single iteration of the entire system. Consider the simple example of a presidential system, like the USA maintains, as a smart institution {{with the office of}} the president serves as a steering institution. Suppose the set of reference variables comprise a vector of elements, where each element pertains to a specific department of the government, with the cabinet secretaries functioning as actuators. To implement these objectives, the president’s office generates actuating signals, or directives, that are sent to each cabinet secretary. The actuators (secretaries) take these low-powered signals and generate high-powered ones that are capable of influencing the output. The bureaucracy within each department functions as the main mechanism of the plant where this high-powered signal is converted into an output. For instance, the Department of Education may be sent a directive based on an executive <b>reference</b> <b>variable</b> on average examination scores to be achieved by public schools; the Department for the Environment may be sent a directive based on a <b>reference</b> <b>variable</b> for a certain amount of reduction in carbon emissions; the Treasury may be sent a directive based on a <b>reference</b> <b>variable</b> for the fiscal deficit and so on. Indeed, each department may be sent a multiple of directives based on a single or more than one reference variables.|$|E

40|$|Multiple mapping {{conditioning}} (MMC) is used {{to model}} local extinction and reignition phenomena in homogeneous, isotropic decaying turbulence. It is recognized that mixture fraction alone {{is not sufficient to}} account for turbulent scalar fluctuations and that more than one <b>reference</b> <b>variable</b> needs to be introduced. We introduce a second <b>reference</b> <b>variable</b> with a dual character: the second variable is a dissipation-like variable that emulates the intermittent behaviour of scalar dissipation and it is therefore the cause for local extinction in our modelling. However, the second variable is also used to match the scalar variance of a reaction progress variable to ensure consistency in temperature flucutations of the MMC model and Direct Numerical Simulations. The resulting model provides a (fully) closed formulation for the modelling of local extinction and re-ignition events and predictions of the joint probability distribution of mixture fraction and sensible enthalpy, of reactive species and of the global conversion rates are good and clear improvments over conventional mixture fraction based methods that use mixture fraction as the only conditioning paramenter...|$|E
40|$|Data {{containing}} deterministic relations {{cannot be}} handled by current constraint-based causal learning algorithms; they entail conditional independencies that cannot be represented by a faithful graph. Violation of the faithfulness property is characterized by an information equivalence of two sets of variables {{with respect to a}} <b>reference</b> <b>variable.</b> The conditional independencies do not provide information about which set should be connected to the <b>reference</b> <b>variable.</b> We propose to use the complexity of the relationships as criterion to determine adjacency. Correct decisions are made under the assumption that the complexity of relations does not increase along a causal path. This paper defines an augmented Bayesian network which explicitly models deterministic relations. The faithfulness property is redefined by using a generalized definition of the d-separation criterion, which also gives the conditional independencies following from deterministic relations, and by limiting the conditional independencies that are graphically described with the simplicity condition. Based on this, an extension to the PC learning algorithm is developed that allows the construction of minimal augmented Bayesian networks from observational data. Correct models are learned from data generated by a set of structural equations. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{multiple}} mapping conditioning (MMC) {{method is}} used to extend the stochastic PDF approach to the flamelet regimes of premixed combustion. MMC permits for a desired degree of flamelet-like conditions while reflecting the fluctuating nature of turbulent flames and preserving the integrity and universality of the chosen mixing model. The model is implemented {{in the context of}} the partially stirred reactor (PaSR), which is therefore generalised to have a wider range of applicability. A stochastic formulation of original MMC is deployed, where mixing of particle scalar values is conditioned on a Markovian <b>reference</b> <b>variable</b> which emulates an implied particle position relative to a flame. The model interactions with the <b>reference</b> <b>variable</b> are controlled through the flamelet localness parameter, Λ, which is also related to the ratio of diffusive to convective time scales. The model is implemented in a Monte Carlo numerical scheme using detailed GRI 3. 0 chemical kinetics without adjustments of kinetic coefficients. Predictions of NOx emissions are validated against experimental data for a lean premixed high-pressure combustor in which reactions fall between the flamelet and distributed regimes. There is good agreement between model predictions and experimental data. Crown Copyrigh...|$|E

Such formalisms, however, have difficulty with modeling process creation or death and communication reconfigurability. Here, we introduce “dynamic reactive modules” (DRM), a state-transition modeling formalism that supports dynamic reconfiguration and creation/death of processes. The resulting formalism supports two types of variables, data <b>variables</b> and <b>reference</b> <b>variables.</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>variables</b> enable changing the connectivity between processes and referring to instances of processes. We show how this new formalism supports parallel composition and refinement through trace containment. DRM provide a natural language for modeling (and ultimately reasoning about) biological systems and multiple threads communicating through shared variables. ...|$|R
