The lack of {{training}} or minimum qualifications for paid federal tax return preparers resulted in concerns that some ill-equipped tax preparers were making numerous errors costly to taxpayers and to the United States Treasury. Income tax laws in the United States are complex and change nearly every year. United States Taxpayer Advocate Nina E.

40|$|This paper investigates {{coordination}} of {{a supply chain}} consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer facing consumer return. We integrate consumer returns policy and manufacturer buyback policy within a modeling framework and explicitly model {{the positive effect of}} <b>refund</b> <b>amount</b> on demand and its negative effect on the probability that consumers keep the products. We design a buyback/markdown money contract to coordinate the supply chain under partial refund policy and find that the <b>refund</b> <b>amount</b> {{plays an important role in}} the decisions and profitability of the players. In the coordinated setting with given buyback price, the <b>refund</b> <b>amount</b> first increases the players' expected profits/quantity, and then decreases them. When the risk (variance) of the consumer's valuation increases, the manufacturer may raise the unit wholesale price to achieve a higher unit profit. The supply chain is better off using full refund policy if the risk is very small; otherwise, the supply chain prefers no returns policy. The results of this paper are robust to distribution form.

There is also aggregate demand uncertainty, captured using the conventional newsvendor model. In this environment, consumers decide whether to purchase and then whether to return the product, whereas the seller sets the price, quantity, and <b>refund</b> <b>amount.</b> Using our model, we study the impact of full returns policies (e. g., using 100 % money-back guarantees) and partial returns policies (e. g., when restocking fees are charged) on supply chain performance. Next, we demonstrate that consumer returns policies may distort incentives under common supply contracts (such as manufacturer buy-backs), and we propose strategies to coordinate the supply chain {{in the presence of}} consumer returns. Finally, we explore several extensions and demonstrate the robustness of our findings. consumer returns, supply chains, valuation uncertainty, newsvendor model, supply contracts...|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} whether retailers {{should consider}} consumer returns when merchandising, we study how the optimal assortment of a price-taking retailer {{is influenced by}} its return policy. The retailer selects its assortment from an exogenous set of horizontally differentiated products. Consumers make purchase and keep/return decisions in nested multinomial logit fashion. Our main finding is that the optimal assortment has a counterintuitive structure for relatively strict return policies: It is optimal to offer a mix {{of the most popular}} and most eccentric products when the <b>refund</b> <b>amount</b> is sufficiently low, which {{can be viewed as a}} form of risk sharing between the retailer and consumers. In contrast, if the refund is sufficiently high, or when returns are disallowed, optimal assortment is composed of only the most popular products (a common finding in the literature). We provide preliminary empirical evidence for one of the key drivers of our results: more eccentric products have higher probability of return – conditional on purchase. In light of our analytical findings and managerial insights, we conclude that retailers should take their return policies into account when merchandising. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} model of price {{discrimination}} where a monopolist faces a consumer who is privately informed about the distribution of his valuation for an indivisible unit of good but has yet to learn privately the actual valuation. The monopolist sequentially screens the consumer with a menu of contracts: the consumer self-selects once by choosing a contract and then self-selects again when he learns the actual valuation. A deterministic sequential mechanism is a menu of refund contracts, each consisting of an advance payment and a <b>refund</b> <b>amount</b> in case of no consumption, but sequential mechanisms may involve randomization. We characterize the optimal sequential mechanism when some consumer types are more eager {{in the sense of}} first-order stochastic dominance, and when some types face greater valuation uncertainty in the sense of mean-preserving-spread. We show that it can be optimal to subsidize consumer types with smaller valuation uncertainty (through low refund, as in airplane ticket pricing) {{in order to reduce the}} rent to those with greater uncertainty. The size of distortion depends both on the type distribution and on how informative the consumer's initial private knowledge is about his valuation, but not on how much he initially knows about the valuation per se...|$|E

40|$|The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is {{the largest}} anti-poverty fiscal policy program for working, low-wealth {{families}} administered through the tax code. For the 2004 tax season, US-Mexico border county receipts of the EITC refund amounted to $ 1. 9 billion while the total <b>refund</b> <b>amount</b> for low-income Borderlands families was $ 2. 6 billion. For the nation, $ 38 billion in EITC refunds were disbursed to eligible working families in tax year 2003.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} expansion of refundable credits over the past twenty years. This trend is likely to continue as part of federal policy to stimulate the economy and promote non-tax related social benefits. With the growing use of the tax system to deliver refundable benefits to individuals, the tax preparation industry as a whole has become, in some significant respects, a vehicle for cross-marketing of non-tax goods and services. Refund anticipation loans, or RALs, are one example of these non-tax products that paid preparers facilitate for their customers. RALS are short-term loans secured by a taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s anticipated tax <b>refund</b> <b>amount.</b> A taxpayer will borrow against the anticipated refund, and will be required to repay the loan regardless {{of the size of the}} actual <b>refund</b> <b>amount.</b> The RAL lender issues the taxpayer the amount of the anticipated refund less any preparation fees, as well as any filing, finance, and processing charges. The IRS refund is then transferred directly to the lender to pay back the loan. RAL customers receive their money between two and six weeks faster than waiting for their refund check. RALs have created a substantial market, with about 900 million in loan-related RAL fees being generated annually. The creation of RALs has opened up a major market niche, with their popularity largely coming with the advent of the IRS 2 ̆ 7 s e-filing program, and their use often associated with the receipt of earned income tax credit (EITC) -generated refunds. Over time, RAL providers have come under fire from consumer advocates, elected officials, and IRS officials. The criticisms of RALs have come from two general starting points: 1) a social policy standpoint that draws heavily from general consumer protection concerns, including that RALs compromise taxpayer privacy and unfairly drain away precious tax benefits through fees that are high when computed on an annual percentage basis, and 2) a more targeted tax compliance perspective examining the role that RALS play in contributing to the underreporting aspect of the tax gap. While noting that consumer privacy and general consumer protection concerns are independent bases for further regulation, this essay focuses on the debate over RALs 2 ̆ 7 effect on tax compliance, and its contribution to the tax gap. While RALs are regulated to a limited extent by the IRS and Treasury, the IRS and the National Taxpayer Advocate have raised concerns about whether RALS create incentives for less compliant behavior among preparers who facilitate access to RAL lenders. In 2008 the IRS issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR), seeking comments to determine to what degree RALs and other similar products should be further regulated. The rule on which the IRS and Treasury were seeking guidance would prohibit the use of information obtained during the tax preparation process for the purpose of marketing any product. This new rule would, at a minimum, inject additional costs for preparers and consumers and likely limit their use in some way. The question that the IRS raised in its ANPR focused on whether RALs contribute to increased demand for overstated tax refunds. This question itself raises many unanswered questions. For example, does the additional speed in which individuals receive money embolden inappropriate taxpayer conduct? If the answer is yes, assuming practitioners can influence taxpayer compliance decisions, will increased regulation of preparers generally or RALs in particular result in fewer taxpayers willing to misstate facts to generate an improper refund? Do additional profits derived from RALs contribute to preparers 2 ̆ 7 willingness to turn a blind eye to existing due diligence rules? Or even worse, do RALs contribute to conditions where preparers themselves are facilitating the noncompliance through more preparer-generated noncompliance efforts? These questions highlight the lack of information that hampers policymakers in designing effective measures to reduce the tax gap. Until the IRS generates quantitative data that identifies, for example, preparer types and correlates error rates with types of preparers, and generates studies comparing error rates among preparers offering RALs as compared with non RAL-seeking taxpayers, it is difficult to justify taking measures that may effectively limit RALs on compliance reasons alone. This essay argues that in addition to the importance of additional research relating to preparers to backstop heavy-handed regulatory efforts, the IRS should broadly consider the insights from responsive regulation, and in particular consider ways to encourage preparers to self-regulate. Self-regulation allows the IRS to preserve scarce compliance resources for egregious actors. The focus on RALs in this essay allows for a further inquiry into the special role that preparers play in our tax system, and reflects the possibility that meaningfully working with the preparer community can be a means to reducing the tax gap in the thorny area of refundable credits...|$|E
40|$|The retail-market {{demand for}} a newsboy-type product is uncertain. The product's {{manufacturer}} sets: (i) a wholesale price "w/unit" for selling the product to the retailer, and (ii) the <b>refund</b> <b>amount</b> "r/unit" (if any) for unsold units returned by the retailer. Given w and r, the retailer determines: (i) the quantity Q that he orders from the manufacturer, and (ii) the retailer price "p/unit" at which he sells to the consumers. Keeping in mind the retailer's freedom to set Q and p in the retailer's own interest, the manufacturer needs {{to determine how to}} set w and r that are optimal for the manufacturer. For this market structure, this paper studies how the level of retail-market demand uncertainty will affect the decisions (w, r, Q, p), the expected manufacturer's profit and the expected retailer's profit. Many of the effects turn out to be counter-intuitive with interesting explanations. This paper extends a problem considered (in different variations) in several recent papers in major IE/MS/OR, marketing and economics journals. Somewhat counter-intuitive (and contradictory) results are presented here. Single-period of "newsboy-type" products {{have been the subject of}} many recent studies. Practically all these studies assume that there is only one decision-maker; i. e., the vertically integrated "manufacturer-cum-retailer". As an entirely separate issue, the interactions between a manufacturer and a retailer in a "market channel" have also been widely studied, but mostly in the context of amulti-period product. Both characteristics ("single-period product" and "market channel") were included in Iyer and Bergen's (Management Science [4]) investigation of a manufacturer-retailer channel for fashion goods. Iyer and Bergen considered the effects of demand-uncertainty reduction; they made the following assumptions: I. the manufacturer cannot change the wholesale price; II. the manufacturer does not accept returns from the retailer; and III. the retail price is fixed. With Iyer and Bergen's assumptions I-III relaxed, Emmons and Gilbert (Management Science [8]) considered manufacturer-retailer interactions for newsboy products. However, their results do not relate to how demand-uncertainty reduction would affect the manufacturer-retailer interactions (i. e., Iyer and Bergen's question). Our paper shows that when one or more of Iyer and Bergen's three assumptions are relaxed, the effects of demand-uncertainty reduction are significantly different from those depicted in Iyer and Bergen's paper. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|In this dissertation, I develop econometric and {{optimization}} {{models to}} help retailers better manage their consumer returns. I {{shed light on}} some prevalent industry practices and beliefs relevant to consumer returns management and provide managerial implications while filling some of the existing gaps {{in the literature of}} consumer returns. In the first essay, I examine the association between in-store customer shopping experience during a purchase and subsequent return and repurchase behavior. Using over 21 million purchase and return transactions and nearly 75, 000 customer satisfaction survey responses from a national jewelry retailer, I conduct a detailed analysis that incorporates a sample selection model with simultaneous recursive equation models. Return rates across stores within the same company can vary significantly. In {{the first part of this}} essay, I empirically examine this variation with respect to product quality, service quality, and customer satisfaction. The analysis reveals surprising findings for retailers. For instance, I demonstrate that retail efforts such as increasing salesperson competence and improving store environment, so long believed to reduce returns, may actually be associated with increased returns. I also show that service quality during a purchase can be more important than product quality in return prevention. In the second part of this essay, I provide empirical evidence that a return event can moderate the satisfaction-repurchase behavior link. More importantly, I show that that a return event may enable a retailer to regain a dissatisfied customer who would otherwise be lost. In the second essay, motivated by common practice, I study the retail strategy of selling open-box returns side-by-side with new products. I develop a model to assess the impact of cannibalization due to open-box product sales on profitability and to identify the conditions in which selling them is preferred to simply salvaging them through liquidators. The operational decisions are the order quantity, the <b>refund</b> <b>amount,</b> and the open-box product price. The model captures important market characteristics that include consumer choice between new and open-box products, uncertainty and heterogeneity in consumer valuation for both products, and customer sensitivity to a retailer's return policy. I find that, even if open-box products cannibalize new demand, selling returns as open-box is always more profitable than simply salvaging them so long as there is demand for open-box products. Furthermore, retailers may increase their market share by selling open-box products if customer sensitivity to a retailer's return policy is low. If it is high, retailers should use a generous policy while charging premium prices. I also demonstrate that higher return rates do not necessarily lead to a decrease in profit...|$|E
