The most common shapes are called open-ended spanner and <b>ring</b> <b>spanner.</b> The term wrench is generally used for tools that turn non-fastening devices (e.g. tap wrench and pipe wrench), or {{may be used for}} a monkey wrench - an adjustable spanner.|$|E

The offset screwdriver has a handle set at right angles to the small blade, providing access to narrow spaces and giving extra torque.|$|E

5000|$|A {{peanut butter}} wrench, {{also known as}} a crank bolt spanner or a crank spanner, is a {{single-ended}} box wrench or <b>ring</b> <b>spanner</b> used in cycling to tighten older 14 mm and 15 mm crank bolts, or the wheel nuts (track nuts) on hubs with solid axles commonly found on track bicycles, particularly the 15 mm wrench made by Campagnolo. This is the only one-piece wrench {{that can be used to}} tighten or loosen the bolt or nut which holds the crank to a square-taper bottom bracket spindle (although a thin-walled 15 mm socket and handle will also serve), whereas any wrench/spanner of the correct size will tighten or loosen wheel nuts.|$|E
