40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Corrective Action Plan (CAP) is to provide the {{strategy}} and methodology to close the Area 22 Weather Station Fuel Storage. The CAU will be closed following state and federal regulations and the FFACO (1996). Site characterization was done during February 1999. Soil samples were collected using a direct-push method. Soil samples were collected at 0. 6 -m (2 -ft) intervals from the surface to 1. 8 m (6 ft) below ground surface. The results of the characterization were reported in the Corrective Action Decision Document (CADD) (DOE, 1999 b).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Corrective Action Plan (CAP) is to provide the {{strategy}} and methodology to close the Area 22 Sewage Lagoons site. The CAU will be closed following state and federal regulations and the FFACO (1996). Site characterization was done during September 1999, Soil samples were collected using a direct-push method and a backhoe. Soil samples were collected from the sludge bed, sewage lagoons, strainer box, and Imhoff tank areas. Characterization of the manholes associated with the septic system leading to the Imhoff tank was done during March 2000. The results of the characterization were reported in the Corrective Action Decision Document (CADD) (DOE/NV, 2000). Soil sample {{results indicated that the}} only constituent of concern (COC) detected above Preliminary Action Levels (PALs) was total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as diesel-range organics.

40|$|This paper {{assumes that}} the <b>regulatory</b> <b>action</b> <b>levels</b> or {{threshold}} values used to establish acceptable/unacceptable levels of contamination have been developed in a defensible manner. Although evaluating {{the validity of the}} <b>action</b> <b>level</b> is a very important component of scientifically defensible decisions about whether a site poses unacceptable risk, the topic itself {{is beyond the scope of}} this paper. Likewise, while the selection and implementation of specific cleanup activities are important, the topic of remedial technologies is also beyond this discussion. This paper addresses issues that revolve around the generation and use of contaminant data as produced by analytical chemistry methods. Uses for this data include determining the nature and extent of site contamination, short- or longterm monitoring of remedial effectiveness, and demonstrating regulatory compliance. Contaminant data are used to decide whether remedial actions are required for a site, and if so, to guide the selection and design of remedial activities.

40|$|During this {{reporting}} period our project focused on (1) review of {{case studies of}} remediation of centralized and commercial drilling fluid disposal (CCDD) sites in Texas, and (2) information transfer with preparation of a proceedings paper and a workshop/short course. Texas remediation of certain drilling-fluid disposal sites includes examples at CCDD sites as well as commercial oil reclamation sites and saltwater disposal sites that also disposed of drilling fluids in pits. Site investigations range from qualitative visual inspection and assessment to comprehensive hydrodynamic, chemical, and geophysical analyses of wastes and groundwater. A range of techniques {{has been used to}} evaluate waste material, soil, groundwater, and surface water for potential contamination with hydrocarbons, chemicals, saltwater, and naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM).

40|$|Atrazine, simazine, and {{propazine}} {{and their}} major chlorinated degradates (deethylatrazine, deisopropylatrazine, and didealkylatrazine) are {{considered as a}} group to be endocrine-disrupting chemicals by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. On this basis, <b>regulatory</b> <b>action</b> <b>levels</b> are currently under consideration for the total chloro-s-triazine (TCT) levels in drinking waters. To assess the concentrations {{of each of these}} species in drinking water and their treatability in conventional water treatment, a comprehensive, full-scale studywas conducted that included frequent monitoring at 33 and 47 water utilities during 2003 and 2004, respectively. Approximately 900 paired raw and treated water samples were analyzed using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method with preconcentration using a mixed-mode, solid-phase extraction that allowed quantitation of each species including didealkylatrazine. The results showed that atrazine concentrations were generally well within the 3 microg/L maximum contaminant level (MCL) and that simazine and propazine concentrations were generally negligible. Ninety-fifth-percentile values for the ratio of TCT/atrazine were 4. 8 and 4. 7, respectively. Effectiveness of conventional treatment technologies, including carbon, was observed to vary significantly. Concerns that didealkyatrazine concentrations may be high and significantly elevate the TCT appear to be unfounded. In general, the results suggest that potential treatment requirements for TCT {{are not likely to be}} any more difficult for utilities to meet than the current requirements for atrazine...|$|R

40|$|Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) {{is now one}} of {{the most}} common {{groundwater}} contaminants in the United States. Groundwater contaminated with MTBE is also likely to be contaminated with tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), because TBA is a component of commercial grade MTBE, TBA can also be used as a fuel oxygenate, and TBA is a biodegradation product of MTBE. In California, MTBE is subject to reporting at concentrations greater than 3 {micro}g/L. TBA is classified as a ''contaminant of current interest'' and has a drinking water <b>action</b> <b>level</b> of 12 {micro}g/L. In this paper, we describe the development and optimization of a simple, automated solid phase microextraction (SPME) method for the analysis of MTBE and TBA in water and demonstrate the applicability of this method for monitoring MTBE and TBA contamination in groundwater, drinking water, and surface water. In this method, the headspace (HS) of a water sample is extracted with a carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane SPME fiber, the MTBE and TBA are desorbed into a gas chromatograph (GC), and detected using mass spectrometry (MS). The method is optimized for the routine analysis of MTBE and TBA with a level of quantitation of 0. 3 {micro}g/L and 4 {micro}g/L, respectively, in water. MTBE quantitation was linear for over two orders of concentration (0. 3 {micro}g/L - 80 {micro}g/L). TBA was found to be linear within the range of 4 {micro}g/L- 7, 900 {micro}g/L. The lower level of detection for MTBE is 0. 03 {micro}g/L using this method. This SPME method using headspace extraction was found to be advantageous over SPME methods requiring immersion of the fiber into the water samples, because it prolonged the life of the fiber by up to 400 sample analyses. This is the first time headspace extraction SPME has been shown to be applicable to the measurement of both MTBE and TBA at concentrations below <b>regulatory</b> <b>action</b> <b>levels.</b> This method was compared with the certified EPA Method 5030 / 8260 B (purge-and-trap/GC/MS) using split samples from laboratory bioreactors treating MTBE contaminated water and applied to environmental samples collected throughout the East Bay area of California. Results from the SPME-HS/GC/MS method were directly comparable to the EPA Method 5030 / 8260 B. This method provides an simple, inexpensive, accurate, and sensitive alternative to EPA Method 5030 / 8260 B for the analysis of MTBE and TBA in water samples...|$|R

A cross-sectional survey was conducted in SH summer 1994 / 95 for several organochloride (OC) residues in 13 intertidal sites of the All Saints Bay, using sediments, crabs and three species of local bivalves with different feeding habits as indicators. The quantified compounds were: DDT, DDE, DDD, HCB, ฮณ-HCH, Aldrin, Dieldrin and Endrin. All concentrations found were below limit of <b>regulatory</b> <b>action.</b> Highest <b>levels</b> were found in the Aratu Industrial Centre area, in the Subaรฉ estuary and the Itaparica Channel, where palm oil nursery exists. From the eight compounds DDE presented the highest levels (44 ng/g wet wt in B. exustus) and B. exustus the highest bioconcentration factors. Comparing these data with equivalent ones of 1985, increases have been observed at all sites, except where an oil refinery operates in restricted area. DDT/DDE ratio for the sediments in some sites were 0. 91 or higher, indicating probable DDT use in the last 5 years.

40|$|International audienceSpermidine/spermine N 1 -acetyltransferase (SSAT), the {{key enzyme}} in the {{catabolism}} of polyamines, is turned over rapidly and its {{content in the}} cell is low. In this study, the regulation of SSAT by spermine analogs, the inducers of the enzyme, was studied in the wild-type mouse fetal fibroblasts expressing endogenous SSAT and in the SSAT-deficient mouse fetal fibroblasts transiently expressing the SSAT- EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) fusion gene. In both cell lines treatments with DENSpm (N 1, N 11 โbis(ethyl) norspermine), CPENSpm (N 1 -ethyl-N 11 -((cyclopropyl) methyl) - 4, 8 -diazaundecane) and CHENSpm (N 1 -ethyl-N 11 -((cycloheptyl) methyl) - 4, 8 -diazaundecane) led to high, moderate or low induction of SSAT activity, respectively. The detected levels of activities correlated {{with the presence of}} SSAT and SSAT-EGFP proteins, the last one localizing both in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Reverse transcriptase -PCR results suggested that the analog-affected regulation of SSAT-EGFP expression occurred mainly at the levels beyond transcription. In the wild-type cells, DENSpm increased the amount of SSAT mRNA and both DENSpm and CHENSpm affected splicing of the SSAT pre-mRNA. Depleted intracellular spermidine and spermine levels inversely correlated with the detected SSAT activities. Interestingly, the analogs also reduced polyamine levels in the SSAT-deficient cells expressing the EGFP control. The results from the present study show that the distinct SSAT regulation by different analogs involves <b>regulatory</b> <b>actions</b> at multiple <b>levels</b> and the spermine analogs, in addition to inducing SSAT, lower intracellular polyamine pools by SSAT-independent mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{conduct a}} {{synthesis}} {{of the literature on}} methods to evaluate the impacts of FDA <b>regulatory</b> <b>actions</b> and identify best practices for future evaluations. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE for manuscripts published between January 1948 and August 2011 that included terms related to FDA, <b>regulatory</b> <b>actions,</b> and empirical evaluation; the review additionally included FDA-identified literature. We used a modified Delphi method to identify preferred methodologies. We included studies with explicit methods to address threats to validity and identified designs and analytic methods with strong internal validity that have been applied to other policy evaluations. RESULTS: We included 18 studies out of 243 abstracts and papers screened. Overall, analytic rigor in prior evaluations of FDA <b>regulatory</b> <b>actions</b> varied considerably; {{less than a quarter of}} studies (22 %) included control groups. Only 56 % assessed changes in the use of substitute products/services, and 11 % examined patient health outcomes. Among studies meeting minimal criteria of rigor, 50 % found no impact or weak/modest impacts of FDA actions and 33 % detected unintended consequences. Among those studies finding significant intended effects of FDA actions, all cited the importance of intensive communication efforts. There are preferred methods with strong internal validity that have yet to be applied to evaluations of FDA <b>regulatory</b> <b>actions.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Rigorous evaluations of the impact of FDA <b>regulatory</b> <b>actions</b> have been limited and infrequent.
