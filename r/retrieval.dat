40|$|Monthly mean aerosol {{optical depth}} (AOD) over ocean is {{compared}} from {{a total of}} 9 aerosol <b>retrievals</b> during a 40 months period. Comparisons of AOD have been made both for the entire period and sub periods. We identify regions where there is large disagreement and good agreement between the aerosol satellite <b>retrievals.</b> Significant differences in AOD {{have been identified in}} most of the oceanic regions. Several analyses are performed including spatial correlation between the <b>retrievals</b> as well as comparison with AERONET data. During the 40 months period studied there have been several major aerosol field campaigns as well as events of high aerosol content. It is studied how the aerosol <b>retrievals</b> compare during such circumstances. The differences found in this study are larger than found in a previous study where 5 aerosol <b>retrievals</b> over an 8 months period were compared. However, results in coastal regions are promising especially for aerosol <b>retrievals</b> from satellite instruments dedicated for aerosol research. In depth analyses explaining the differences between AOD obtained in different <b>retrievals</b> are clearly needed. We limit this study to identify differences and similarities and indicate possible sources that affect the quality of the <b>retrievals.</b> This is a necessary first step towards understanding the differences and improving the <b>retrievals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) {{is a new}} Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) {{algorithm}} {{that combines}} time series approach and image processing to derive surface reflectance and atmosphere products, such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) and columnar water vapor (CWV). The quality assessment of MAIAC AOD at 1 km resolution is still lacking across South America. In the present study, critical assessment of MAIAC AOD(sub 550) was performed using ground-truth data from 19 Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites over South America. Additionally, we validated the MAIAC CWV <b>retrievals</b> using the same AERONET sites. In general, MAIAC AOD Terra/Aqua <b>retrievals</b> show high agreement with ground-based measurements, with a correlation coefficient (R) close to unity (R(sub Terra) : 0. 956 and R(sub Aqua) : 0. 949). MAIAC accuracy depends on the surface properties and comparisons revealed high confidence <b>retrievals</b> over cropland, forest, savanna, and grassland covers, where more than 2 / 3 (approximately 66 %) of <b>retrievals</b> are within the expected error (EE = +/-(0. 05 + 0. 05 AOD)) and R exceeding 0. 86. However, AOD <b>retrievals</b> over bright surfaces show lower correlation than those over vegetated areas. Both MAIAC Terra and Aqua <b>retrievals</b> are similarly comparable to AERONET AOD over the MODIS lifetime (small bias offset approximately 0. 006). Additionally, MAIAC CWV presents quantitative information with R approximatley 0. 97 and more than 70 % of <b>retrievals</b> within error (+/- 15 %). Nonetheless, the time series validation shows an upward bias trend in CWV Terra <b>retrievals</b> and systematic negative bias for CWV Aqua. These results contribute to a comprehensive evaluation of MAIAC AOD <b>retrievals</b> as a new atmospheric product for future aerosol studies over South America...|$|R

40|$|Calculation of mean {{trace gas}} {{contributions}} from profiles obtained by <b>retrievals</b> of the logarithm of the abundance rather than <b>retrievals</b> of the abundance itself {{are prone to}} biases. By means of a system simulator, biases of linear versus logarithmic averaging were evaluated for both maximum likelihood and maximum a priori <b>retrievals,</b> for various signal to noise ratios and atmospheric variabilities. These biases can easily reach several ten percent. As {{a rule of thumb}} we found for maximum likelihood <b>retrievals</b> that linear averaging better represents the true mean value in cases of large local natural variability and high signal to noise ratios, while for small local natural variability logarithmic averaging often is superior. In the case of maximum a posteriori <b>retrievals,</b> the mean is dominated by the a priori information used in the <b>retrievals</b> and the method of averaging is of minor concern. For larger natural variabilities, the appropriateness of the one or the other method of averaging depends on the particular case because the various biasing mechanisms partly compensate in a hardly predictable manner. This complication arises mainly {{because of the fact that}} in logarithmic <b>retrievals</b> the weight of the prior information depends on abundance of the gas itself. No simple rule was found on which kind of averaging is superior, and instead of suggesting simple recipes we cannot do much more than to create awareness of the traps related with averaging of mixing ratios obtained from logarithmic <b>retrievals...</b>|$|R

In the GOMOS <b>retrievals,</b> the scintillation effect is corrected using scintillation measurements by the fast photometer. We present quantitative estimates of the current scintillation correction quality and of the impact of scintillation on ozone <b>retrievals</b> by GOMOS. The analysis has shown that the present scintillation correction efficiently removes the distortion of transmission spectra caused by anisotropic scintillations. The impact of errors of dilution and anisotropic scintillation correction on quality of ozone <b>retrievals</b> is negligible. However, the current scintillation correction is not able to remove the wavelength-dependent distortion of transmission spectra caused by isotropic scintillations, which can be present in off-orbital-plane occultations.

40|$|CO inverse {{modelling}} {{studies have}} so far reported significant discrepancies between model concentrations optimised with the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) satellite <b>retrievals</b> and surface in-situ measurements. Here, we assess how well a global CTM fits a large variety of independent CO observations (surface and aircraft air sample measurements and ground-based column <b>retrievals)</b> before and after assimilating MOPITTv 6 total column (X CO) <b>retrievals</b> to optimise CO sources/sinks. Consistent negative prior biases to all types of observations in all sensitivity tests suggest an underestimation of current surface emissions in the Northern hemisphere. In contrast, prior simulations fit the surface air sample observations well in the Southern hemisphere but underestimate CO in the free troposphere and on average in the column. Positive biases in MOPITT <b>retrievals</b> are identified in the Northern mid- and high latitudes, highlighting the importance of proper bias-correction of those satellite <b>retrievals.</b> Biases in representing vertical CO profiles are found over the ocean and most significantly in the Southern hemisphere, suggesting errors in the vertical distribution of CO chemical sources/sinks or in the vertical mixing to be improved in future modelling studies. Varying model-data differences {{are found in the}} vertical between CTM and MOPITT retrieved vertical profiles after having assimilated MOPITT X CO; these bias structures indicate that the posterior model differences to in-situ observations would be even larger if the near surface <b>retrievals</b> were assimilated instead of X CO. In addition, given the higher long-term stability of the MOPITT X CO <b>retrievals</b> as opposed to divergent temporal bias drifts found in the vertical profile <b>retrievals</b> and a lower sensitivity to model errors in the total column quantity than at a certain altitude, we recommend assimilating the column rather than the profiles or the partial profiles at the current stage...|$|R
