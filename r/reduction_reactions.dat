25|$|Vitamin B3, {{also known}} as niacin, {{includes}} both nicotinamide as well as nicotinic acid, both of which function in many biological oxidization and <b>reduction</b> <b>reactions</b> within the body. These functions include the biochemical degradation of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Niacin is also involved in the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol, which are known mediators of brain biochemistry, and in effect, of cognitive function.|$|E
25|$|Oxidation and <b>reduction</b> <b>reactions</b> are {{not common}} in organic {{chemistry}} as few organic molecules {{can act as}} oxidizing or reducing agents. Iron(II), on the other hand, can easily be oxidized to iron(III). This functionality is used in cytochromes, which function as electron-transfer vectors. The presence of the metal ion allows metalloenzymes to perform functions such as redox reactions that cannot easily be performed by the limited set of functional groups found in amino acids. The iron atom in most cytochromes is contained in a heme group. The differences between those cytochromes lies in the different side-chains. For instance cytochrome a has a heme a prosthetic group and cytochrome b has a heme b prosthetic group. These differences result in different Fe2+/Fe3+ redox potentials such that various cytochromes {{are involved in the}} mitochondrial electron transport chain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} of iron from its ores involves powerful <b>reduction</b> <b>reactions</b> in blast furnaces. Cooling waters are inevitably contaminated with products especially ammonia and cyanide.

Contamination of waste streams includes gasification products such as benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, cyanide, ammonia, phenols, cresols [...] together with a range of more complex organic compounds known collectively as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).|$|E

40|$|A new {{bimetallic}} nanocomposite of chitosan was prepared. Pd and Co nanoparticles were {{deposited on}} chitosan {{to produce a}} new heterogeneous recyclable catalyst {{for use in the}} bimetallic catalytic <b>reduction</b> <b>reaction.</b> The catalyst was characterized with common analysis methods for nanocomposites including Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy, X-Ray Diffraction pattern, Thermal Gravimetric Analysis, Flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy, and applied in the <b>reduction</b> <b>reaction</b> of nitroaromatics using NaBH 4 at room temperature. The bimetallic system gave good results compared to each of the applied metals. Various aromatic amines and diamines were used in the <b>reduction</b> <b>reaction.</b> The aromatic amines were obtained as the sole product of the <b>reduction</b> <b>reaction</b> with 15 mol% Pd and 12 mol% Co during 2 h.

2500|$|Mercurous {{chloride}} {{is employed}} extensively in electrochemistry, {{taking advantage of}} the ease of its oxidation and <b>reduction</b> <b>reactions.</b> [...] The calomel electrode is a reference electrode, especially in older publications. [...] Over the past 50 years, it has been superseded by the silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode. [...] Although the mercury electrodes have been widely abandoned due to the dangerous nature of mercury, many chemists believe they are still more accurate and are not dangerous {{as long as they are}} handled properly. The differences in experimental potentials vary little from literature values. [...] Other electrodes can vary by 70 to 100 millivolts.|$|E
2500|$|In some literature, {{the terms}} [...] "anode" [...] and [...] "cathode" [...] {{are used in}} place of {{negative}} electrode and positive electrode. Using anode and cathode to describe the electrodes in supercapacitors (and also rechargeable batteries including lithium ion batteries) can lead to confusion, because the polarity changes depending on whether a component is considered as a generator or as a consumer of current. In electrochemistry, cathode and anode are related to reduction and oxidation reactions, respectively. However, in supercapacitors based on electric double layer capacitance, there is no oxidation and/or <b>reduction</b> <b>reactions</b> {{on any of the}} two electrodes. Therefore, the concepts of cathode and anode do not apply.|$|E

2500|$|In 1939, British {{engineer}} Francis Thomas Bacon successfully {{developed a}} 5kW stationary fuel cell. In 1955, W. Thomas Grubb, a chemist {{working for the}} General Electric Company (GE), further modified the original fuel cell design by using a sulphonated polystyrene ion-exchange membrane as the electrolyte. Three years later another GE chemist, Leonard Niedrach, devised a way of depositing platinum onto the membrane, which served as catalyst for the necessary hydrogen oxidation and oxygen <b>reduction</b> <b>reactions.</b> This {{became known as the}} [...] "Grubb-Niedrach fuel cell". GE went on to develop this technology with NASA and McDonnell Aircraft, leading to its use during Project Gemini. This was the first commercial use of a fuel cell. In 1959, a team led by Harry Ihrig built a 15kW fuel cell tractor for Allis-Chalmers, which was demonstrated across the U.S. at state fairs. This system used potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and compressed hydrogen and oxygen as the reactants. Later in 1959, Bacon and his colleagues demonstrated a practical five-kilowatt unit capable of powering a welding machine. In the 1960s, Pratt and Whitney licensed Bacon's U.S. patents for use in the U.S. space program to supply electricity and drinking water (hydrogen and oxygen being readily available from the spacecraft tanks). In 1991, the first hydrogen fuel cell automobile was developed by Roger Billings.|$|E
