25|$|The <b>relative</b> <b>increase</b> {{in solar}} {{irradiation}} at closest {{approach to the}} Sun (perihelion) compared to the irradiation at the furthest distance (aphelion) is slightly larger than four times the eccentricity. For Earth's current orbital eccentricity, incoming solar radiation varies by about 6.8%, while {{the distance from the}} Sun currently varies by only 3.4% (5.1millionkm). Perihelion presently occurs around January 3, while aphelion is around July 4. When the orbit is at its most eccentric, the amount of solar radiation at perihelion will be about 23% more than at aphelion. However, the Earth's eccentricity is always so small that the variation in solar irradiation is a minor factor in seasonal climate variation, compared to axial tilt and even compared to the relative ease of heating the larger land masses of the northern hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of genomes {{of modern}} humans {{show that they}} mated {{with at least two}} groups of Archaic humans: Neanderthals (more similar to those found in the Caucasus than those from the Altai region) and Denisovans. Approximately 4% of the DNA of non-African modern humans is shared with Neanderthals, {{suggesting}} interbreeding. Tests comparing the Denisova hominin genome with those of six modern humans – a ǃKung from South Africa, a Nigerian, a Frenchman, a Papua New Guinean, a Bougainville Islander and a Han Chinese – showed that between 4% and 6% of the genome of Melanesians (represented by the Papua New Guinean and Bougainville Islander) derives from a Denisovan population; a later study puts the amount at 1.11% (with an additional contribution from some different and yet unknown ancestor). This DNA was possibly introduced during the early migration to Melanesia. These findings are in concordance with the results of other comparison tests which show a <b>relative</b> <b>increase</b> in allele sharing between the Denisovan and the Aboriginal Australian genome, compared to other Eurasians and African populations; however, it has been observed that Papuans, the population of Papua New Guinea, have more allele sharing than Aboriginal Australians.|$|E

40|$|Models of {{political}} competition portray political candidates as seeking {{the support of}} the median voter to win elections by majority voting. In practice, political candidates seek supermajorities rather than majorities based on support of the median voter. We study the political benefits from supermajorities using data from Bavaria, the largest German state. Members of the Bavarian parliament had been permitted to hire relatives as office employees but in the year 2000 the practice was prohibited, with exceptions that allowed continuation of employment of previously hired relatives. The circumstances provide an informative setting to relate political behavior to protection of incumbency. Our results show that the likelihood of politicians to hire <b>relatives</b> <b>increased</b> with the margin of the majority for the incumbent in the previous election. When the majority increased by one percentage point, the likelihood of hiring <b>relatives</b> <b>increased</b> by about one percentage point.

Maternal depressive symptoms predicted <b>relative</b> <b>increases</b> over time in teen externalizing behavior. Child effects were also found, however, in which teen externalizing behavior predicted future <b>relative</b> <b>increases</b> in maternal depressive symptoms.

We have but {{to consider the}} quantity of feeling that exists under such circumstances, and then to ask what are the conditions that determine the direction of its discharge, to at once reach a solution. Take a case. You are sitting in a theatre, absorbed in the progress of an interesting drama. Some climax has been reached which has aroused your sympathies--say, a reconciliation between the hero and heroine, after long and painful misunderstanding. The feelings excited by this scene are not of a kind from which you seek relief; but are, on the contrary, a grateful relief from the painful feelings with which you have witnessed the previous estrangement. Moreover, the sentiments these fictitious personages have for the moment inspired you with, are not such as would lead you to rejoice in any indignity offered to them; but rather, such as would make you resent the indignity. And now, while you are contemplating the reconciliation with a pleasurable sympathy, there appears from behind the scenes a tame kid, which, having stared round at the audience, {{walks up to the}} lovers and sniffs at them. You cannot help joining in the roar which greets this contretemps. Inexplicable as is this irresistible burst on the hypothesis of a pleasure in escaping from mental restraint; or on the hypothesis of a pleasure from <b>relative</b> <b>increase</b> of self-importance, when witnessing the humiliation of others; it is readily explicable if we consider what, in such a case, must become of the feeling that existed at the moment the incongruity arose. A large mass of emotion had been produced; or, to speak in physiological language, {{a large portion of the}} nervous system was in a state of tension. There was also great expectation with respect to the further evolution of the scene--a quantity of vague, nascent thought and emotion, into which the existing quantity of thought and emotion was about to pass.|$|E
