40|$|Egg {{capsules}} of Rajidae species vary in size, {{shape and}} adornments. These differences {{can be used}} as a taxonomic tool to differentiate species. Furthermore, since egg capsule external morphology is adapted to the environment where they are laid, it can be used make inferences on egg-laying grounds. In the present study, oviducal glands and egg capsules of seven species of skates (Leucoraja naevus, <b>Raja</b> <b>brachyura,</b> Raja montagui, Raja microocellata, Raja miraletus, Raja clavata and Raja undulata) are described and compared, and a taxonomic key developed.

40|$|The PhD project {{developed}} during these {{last three years}} concerned {{the analysis of the}} primary and secondary structure of Glycosamminoglycans. The aim of the work was the collection of new information (spectroscopic and conformational ones) about Hyaluronic acid, Chondroitin sulfate and Keratan sulfate, in order to amplify the literature data available about their structures-function relationship. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), are a family of linear polydisperse polysaccharides that take part in several physiological phenomena, including neuronal development, cell–matrix interactions, and activation of chemokines, enzymes, and growth factors. These chains are typically linked to a protein core forming proteoglycans at the cell surface or in the extracellular matrix. The ability of GAGs to regulate these processes is attributed to their complex structure, which arises from extensive modifications (sulfation, deacetylation and epimerization) of a nonsulfated precursor consisting of hexosamine (D-Glucosamine, D-Galactosamine) and either hexuronic acid (D-Glucuronic acid, L-iduronic acid) or galactose residues, arranged in an alternating linear sequence. Based on of the chemical structure backbone, there are four classes of GAGs: Hyaluronan (HA), Heparin (HP) /Heparan sulfate (HS), Chondroitin (CS) /Dermatan sulfate (DS) and Keratan sulfate (KS). Despite their simple backbone sequence, glycosaminoglycans are complex molecules characterized by a heterogeneous structure, for this reason the investigation on them is really challenging and it is performed usually combining many techniques. In this work, analyses were carried out applying a combination of chemical, enzymatic and spectroscopic tools. In some cases the spectroscopic data collected were analyzed with the support of theoretical data obtained through molecular mechanics and dynamics simulations. The complete work, for a easier organization, is divided into two parts: •	Structural characterization of natural GAG samples: 	Chondroitin sulfate from the cartilage of Scyliorhinus canicula, <b>Raja</b> <b>brachyura,</b> and Torpedo nobiliana and also from the skin of <b>Raja</b> <b>brachyura.</b> 	Keratan sulfate from the cartilage of the Scyliorhinus canicula. •	Conformational analyses of GAG oligosaccharides: 	Decasaccharide of hyaluronic acid 	Hexasaccharide of unsulfate chondroitin 	Dodedecasaccharide of chondroitin sulfate 	Pentasaccharides of keratan sulfat...|$|E
40|$|Eggcases {{of eight}} rajiform skates (Dipturus nidarosiensis, D. oxyrinchus, Leucoraja melitensis, <b>Raja</b> asterias, R. <b>brachyura,</b> R. clavata, R. miraletus and R. polystigma) {{present in the}} central-western Mediterranean are described, based on speci- mens {{obtained}} from shery surveys. Eggcase features such as dimensions, horns and apron lengths, and presence/ absence of lateral keels were crucial to discriminate the eggcases of the various species. Morphological and morpho- metric data, con rmed by the multivariate analysis, indicated that the eggcase of R. miraletus and L. melitensis were distinct {{from those of the}} other species for being unkeeled. Within the species having keeled eggcases, those of the genus Dipturus and R. brachyura were discriminated from the remaining group by having the largest dimensions and aprons. Sandy bottoms (< 100 – 150 m depth) were identi ed as egg-laying sites (i. e. sites with females bearing eggcases in uteri) for many species belonging to genus Raja <b>Raja</b> asterias, R. <b>brachyura,</b> R. miraletus and R. polystigma). The nding of R. asterias and R. miraletus carrying eggcases yearly on the same sites, seems to con rm the theory that many rajid species demonstrate site delity, returning to the same depositional area on an annual basis. Some remarks on reproductive biology of these skates are also provided.

40|$|The {{availability}} of updated biological information {{is essential to}} any successful fisheries management plan. An example could be to analyze the main size conversion factors, commonly used to estimate values from one or more known body measurements and particularly helpful when a specimen is damaged and may {{also serve as a}} tool for species identification. In the Mediterranean Sea, limited morphometric information on skates (Rajidae) has been reported, mainly in association with reproduction and growth studies. The goal {{of this paper is to}} estimate relationships between different body measurements to increase the information relative to the most common skate species in Sardinian seas (Central-Western Mediterranean) : Dipturus oxyrinchus, Leucoraja circularis, <b>Raja</b> asterias, R. <b>brachyura,</b> R. clavata, R. miraletus and R. polystigma. For each species, total length (TL), disc width (DW), disc length (DL) and length up to the first dorsal fin (D 1 L), all in millimeters, and total weight (TW), in grams, were taken. An exploratory analysis of morphometric ratios (DW:TL, DL:TL, DL:DW, D 1 L:TL) was performed and the least-squares method was used to estimate the parameters of the linear expressions TL=aDW+b, TL=aDL+b, TL=aD 1 L+b and DW=aDL+b. The relationship between TW and TL was fitted and the function was log-transformed. All species showed an allometric growth (b> 3). Differences in the morphometric ratios were observed within species. L. circularis and D. oxyrinchus showed the most distinctive shapes, relative to the other species: the former showed a narrower disc in relation to TL, the latter had the disc longer in relation to TL. Both skates had the disc longer than wide. The results indicated that the conversion factors were useful to determinate catch size, explore life history change. Moreover, these factors could made morphological comparisons between different species from different geographical areas and should be considered an useful tool to discriminate skate species...|$|R

The main species in biomass terms in this survey were Galeus melastomus (blackmouth catshark), Deania calcea (birdbeak dogfish), Scymnodon ringens (Knifetooth dogfish), Dipturus nidarosiensis (Norwegian skate), Scyliorhinus canicula (lesser spotted dogfish), Etmopterus spinax (velvet belly lantern shark), Hexanchus griseus (bluntnose sixgill shark), Dalatias licha (Kitefin shark), Leucoraja circularis (sandy ray), Dipturus cf. flossada, Leucoraja naevus (cuckoo ray) and Dipturus cf. intermedia (common skate). Biomass, distribution and length ranges were analysed for these species. All the species analysed increased its biomass in 2014, except S. canicula and D. cf. flossada that decreased.

The low values of Levin and Shannon indexes (Bi= 0. 37 and 0. 42, respectively, for the former, and H′= 51. 31 and 1. 62, respectively, for the latter) showed that these two species are specialized predators. An ontogenetic analysis of the diets of three size groups showed that they adopted similar trophic habits. Young R. brachyura specimens (Bi= 0. 27; H′= 1. 05) feed mainly on Crustacea (% IRI= 74) (mainly Mysidiacea and Amphipoda Gammaridea), which were replaced in the diet of medium-large specimens principally by Osteichthyes (mainly Gymnammodytes cicerelus). Multidimensional scaling analysis indicated {{a high level of}} intraspecific competition between medium and large individuals. In R. miraletus, Crustacea represented the main prey in all size groups (% IRI= 99. 5, 99. 6, and 88, respectively).

40|$|A {{study of}} the mixed-species ray fishery off the east and {{southeast}} coast of Ireland was carried out between 1997 and 1998, which involved port sampling and collection of commercial transactions data and official logbook data. Several years of commercial transactions data collected allowed seasonal trends in the relative abundance of the commercial size grades to be deciphered. Catch composition by species and sex was determined for the entire ray landings of individual vessels in the fishery during each port sampling occasion. Biological {{data were collected from}} 17 450 rays during 1997 and these data were used to reconstruct the size and age structure of the population at the species level.

40|$|Elasmobranchs are an {{important}} by-catch of commercial fisheries targeting bony fishes. Fisheries targeting sharks are rare, but usually almost all specimen bycatched are marketed. They risk extinction if current fishing pressure continues (Ferretti et al., 2008). Accurate species identification is critical {{for the design of}} sustainable fisheries and appropriate management plans, especially since not all species are equally sensitive to fishing pressure (Walker & Hislop 1998). The identification of species constitutes the first basic step for biodiversity monitoring and conservation (Dayrat B et al., 2005). More recently, mtDNA sequencing has also been used for species identification and its use has become widespread under the DNA Barcode initiative (e. g. Hebert et al. 2003 a, 2003 b; Ward et al. 2005, 2008 a; Moura et al 2008; Steinke et al. 2009). The aims of this work were: 1) identify sharks and skates species using DNA barcode; 2) compare species of different provenance; 3) use DNA barcode for misidentified species.

Sagittal sections of vertebral centra stained using crystal violet enhanced the underlying band patterns of each species, allowing the derivation of age and von Bertalanffy growth parameters. Age estimates were relatively low for each species, with a maximum age of 7 yr recorded for R. montagui and 8 yr for each other species. Growth rate parameters ranged between K = 0. 093 (L ∞ = 139. 500 and t 0 =- 1. 841) for female R. clavata and K = 0. 304 (L ∞ = 72. 400 and t 0 =- 0. 924) for male R. montagui, and were notably higher for both the smaller growing R. montagui and R. naevus. Morphological assessment of maturity, revealed that; male R. montagui matured at the smallest size (53. 651 cm) and earliest age (3. 410 yrs), male and female R. clavata matured at the greatest age (6. 130 yrs) and female R. brachyura matured at the largest size (83. 560 cm).

The age, growth and reproduction were studied using 1792 specimens caught between 2005 and 2013. Females ranged from 13. 1 to 105. 5 cm in Total length (TL) and males from 18 to 96. 5 cm TL. This species was sexually dimorphic, with TL females attaining a larger size than males. Both females and males showed allometric growth (b> 3) and we found {{significant differences in the}} relationship between length and weight among sexes. The von Bertalanffy growth function (3 parameters), which provided the following values: L∞ = 111. 14 cm TL, k = 0. 10 and t 0 = - 1. 3 for females, and L∞ = 108. 81 cm TL, k = 0. 11 and t 0 = - 1. 2 for males, was the best-fit age model. R. brachyura showed a relatively slow growth rate with males slightly more rapid than females. Length and age at maturity were 87. 2 cm and 14 years for females and 80. 8 cm and 10 years for males. This ray exhibited a restricted reproductive cycle from late May to August, confirmed by the seasonal evolution of GSI values. Ovarian fecundity reached a maximum of 44 yolked follicles.

40|$|The PhD project {{concerned}} {{the analysis of}} the primary and secondary structure of Glycosamminoglycans. The aim of the work was the collection of new information (spectroscopic and conformational ones) about Hyaluronic acid, Chondroitin sulfate and Keratan sulfate, in order to amplify the literature data available about their structures-function relationship. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), are a family of linear polydisperse polysaccharides that take part in several physiological phenomena, including neuronal development, cell–matrix interactions, and activation of chemokines, enzymes, and growth factors. These chains are typically linked to a protein core forming proteoglycans at the cell surface or in the extracellular matrix.

Based on of the chemical structure backbone, there are four classes of GAGs: Hyaluronan (HA), Heparin (HP) /Heparan sulfate (HS), Chondroitin (CS) /Dermatan sulfate (DS) and Keratan sulfate (KS). Despite their simple backbone sequence, glycosaminoglycans are complex molecules characterized by a heterogeneous structure, for this reason the investigation on them is really challenging and it is performed usually combining many techniques. In this work, analyses were carried out applying a combination of chemical, enzymatic and spectroscopic tools. In some cases the spectroscopic data collected were analyzed with the support of theoretical data obtained through molecular mechanics and dynamics simulations. The complete work, for a easier organization, is divided into two parts: •Structural characterization of natural GAG samples: Chondroitin sulfate from the cartilage of Scyliorhinus canicula, <b>Raja</b> <b>brachyura,</b> and Torpedo nobiliana and also from the skin of <b>Raja</b> <b>brachyura.</b> Keratan sulfate from the cartilage of the Scyliorhinus canicula. •Conformational analyses of GAG oligosaccharides: Decasaccharide of hyaluronic acid Hexasaccharide of unsulfate chondroitin Dodedecasaccharide of chondroitin sulfate Pentasaccharides of keratan sulfate Structural characterization of natural GAG samples Structural analyses were performed on chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate chains isolated from natural source: cartilaginous fishes. Purification, quantification and separation of GAGs polysaccharides and their enzymatic-derived oligosaccharides were performed using different chromatographic approaches like anion exchange, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), strong anion exchange HPLC (SAX-HPLC) and reverse phase ion pairing HPLC (RPIP-HPLC). Spectroscopic investigations on the intact molecules and on the different oligosaccharides isolated were performed with NMR spectroscopy. Chondroitin sulfate from the cartilage of Scryliorhinus canicula, <b>Raja</b> <b>brachyura,</b> and Torpedo nobiliana and from the skin of <b>Raja</b> <b>brachyura</b> Compositional analysis of all the CS molecules led to the identification of the same repeating units (CS- 0 S [4) -GlcA-(1 → 3) -GalNAc-(1 -], CS-A [- 4) -GlcA-(1 → 3) -GalNAc 4 S-(1 -], CS-C [- 4) -GlcA-(1 → 3) -GalNAc 6 S-(1 -], and CS-D [- 4) -GlcA 2 S-(1 → 3) -GalNAc 6 S-(1]), but occurring in different percentages. In the table below a summary of the results is reported: Specimen	CS 0 S	CS-A	CS-C	CS-D Scyliorhinus canicula Cartilage	 8. 2 %	 41 %	 32 %	 19. 8 % Raja bochyura Cartilage	 9. 5 %	 36. 5 %	 39. 0 %	 15 % Raja bochyura Skin	 5. 7 %	 37. 1 % 38. 4 %	 18. 8 % Torpedo nobiliana Cartilage 	 0. 9 %	 30. 9 %	 38. 2 %	 30 % This analysis, as expected, highlighted for all the samples a high negative charge density, and among the four CS samples, that isolated from the torpedo cartilage showed the higher charge density, since it was characterized by the higher content of disulfated motif and the minor content of the unsulfated one. For the characterization of the CS isolated from the cartilage of Schilorhinus canicula a new quantitative spectroscopic method was applied (Q-HSQC) too and the data collected were confirmed by the classical analysis (SAX-HPLC) of the mixture of the unsaturated disaccharides obtained by enzymatic depolymerisation (ABC lyase digestion). This disaccharide mixture and that containing the linkage region glycopeptides, moreover, were separated by RPIP-HPLC leading to sample directly analyzed by 2 D-NMR. Characterization of the CS samples isolated from Raja Bochyura and Torpedo Nobiliana tissues was performed by a deep SAX-HPLC analysis of the oligosaccharides mixtures belonging to ABC and AC lyase depolymerisations. The separation of the products resistant to AC lyase action has accidently led to the isolation of oligosaccharides with a structure different from the one expected, since peeling and degradation reactions occurred during the separation steps. In this way besides the classical compositional analysis based on the SAX-HPLC separation of the unsaturated disaccharide mixture a collection of NMR data of CS tri and tetrasaccharides was achieved as well. Keratan sulfate from the cartilage of the Scyliorhinus canicula: Keratan sulfate material was classified as a O-linked glycan with a molecular weight around 10 kDa. The polysaccharide chain, as expected for shark KS, was characterized by GlcNAc 6 S units and both Gal and Gal 6 S units. The structure was not fucosilated, but resulted end-capped by sialic acid units. Conformational analyses of GAG oligosaccharides The conformational studies on Hyaluronic acid, Chondroitin sulfate and Keratan sulfate oligosaccharides were carried out through a combination of spectroscopic and molecular modelling techniques. Decasaccharide of hyaluronic acid The conformational behaviour of a HA decasaccharide was investigated through {{the analysis of the}}oretical data, collected by a molecular dynamics simulation in explicit water, with the support of spectroscopic data collected through Residual Dipolar Coupling NMR techniques. This particular NMR technique was used because the anisotropic conditions (liquid-crystal medium) determine a partial alignment with respect to the external magnetic field and estimation of the relative orientation of the corresponding C-H or H-H vectors with respect to the magnetic field encodes for long range information. The combined use of these NMR and molecular modelling techniques led to establish that in solution the HA tended to assume a quite elongate conformation well described by a left-handed 3 -fold helix. Hexasaccharide of unsulfate chondroitin The secondary structure of unsulfated and sulfated CS oligosaccharides was investigated through the analysis of simulation data collected by MD simulations in explicit water as well, but the spectroscopic data used as reference were collected through the classic NMR spectroscopy in isotropic conditions: D 2 O or D 2 O:H 2 O mixture. The conformational behaviour of the unsulfate CS molecule was similar to the one estimated for the HA, as expected {{on the basis of the}} structural similarity of the two chains, so, in this case a conformation compatible with a left-handed 3 -fold helix geometry was found as well. Differently from HA, however, a higher flexibility for the -(1 → 3) linkage was estimated, as indicated by the larger fluctuation range found for the torsional angle  and by the weak H-bond network defined across the glycosidic junction. Dodedecasaccharide of chondroitin sulfate Investigation on a chondroitin sulfate model sequence, supported by the comparison with the data collected for the unsulfated molecule, highlighted that the presence of sulfate groups affected first of all the behaviour of the glycosidic torsional angles, and not the N-Acetyl disposition, the CH 2 OH preferred rotamer and the H-bond network, because they were similar to those detected for the unsulfated structure. In particular, the presence of sulfate groups led to a reduction of the fluctuation range of both phi and psi torsional angles, with a higher effect on psi one, that shifted in many towards negative values. Pentasaccharides of keratan sulfate Unsulfated and sulfated KS pentasaccharides were studied with molecular mechanics and dynamics simulations in implicit solvent. In this case, the effect of the presence of sulfate groups on the conformation of polylactosamine backbone was investigated. As found for the chondroitin sulfate case, both the glycosidic linkages were affected by the presence of these bulked and negative charged groups and a shift to positive psi values was detected, as well...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of fisheries and globalized trade are emerging as the principal drivers of coastal and ocean threat. Considering {{the important role of}} Chondrichthyes as predators at the top of food chain in marine ecosystems, knowledge on their biology remains scarce in the Mediterranean. In this regard, our objective is to give information on their spatial distribution, abundance and population structure. Data were collected for 25 demersal species, including batoid species, sharks and holocephalans from 1994 to 2013 during scientific bottom trawl surveys (MEDITS project) carried out around the Sardinian seas. The total frequency of occurrence (f%), the Biomass Index (BI, kg/km 2), and the Density Index (DI, N/km 2) were estimated for the continental shelf (10 - 200 m), slope (200 - 800 m), and overall (10 - 800 m) depth strata. Size trends were also calculated for the most abundant species considering all depth strata. The correlation among MEDITS figures (f%, BI, DI, size structure) and years were assessed by species computing the Pearson linear coefficient. From f% and abundance indexes investigation, only the small spotted catshark Scyliorhinus canicula and the thornback ray Raja clavata were ubiquitous in all strata investigated, instead, all the other species showed a preferential distribution for the shelf or the slope. In general, the temporal trends of BI and DI were stable or positive for both macro-strata, except for the longnose spurdog Squalus blainville which seemed to show a statistically significant decreasing trend. All analyzed species displayed temporal stable trends in size structure analysis, apart from <b>Raja</b> <b>brachyura</b> and Dipturus oxyrinchus that showed a statistically significant increase. Despite the time series analysis revealed stable or positive trends, it appears clear the need of urgent management measures to protect the demersal chondrichthyan species extending the monitoring over time and implementing the data collected by scientific and commercial trawl surveys...|$|E
40|$|The dorsoventrally {{flattened}} morphology of benthic ray and flatfish {{species is}} perhaps {{assumed to be}} a constraint on their locomotory ability, suggesting these sit-­‐and-­‐wait predators may exhibit reduced movement and low activity with all species exploiting similar niches. Advancing our understanding of ray and flatfish movement behaviour in relation to the environment is required however, because many commercial and non-­‐ commerical populations are threatened by demersal fisheries. The movement patterns and behaviour of the electronic tagged ray species blonde ray <b>Raja</b> <b>brachyura</b> and spotted ray Raja montagui, and benthic teleosts turbot Psetta maxima and plaice Pleuronectes platessa, were investigated off southwest Britain. Mark-­‐recapture data showed some evidence for site fidelity or increased residence time in preferred locations to some degree in all species investigated. Time-­‐series of waiting times (intervals between periods of activity) were analysed statistically, revealing complex movement patterns and behavioural structure over a wide range of temporal scales. Overall, R. brachyura displayed greater horizontal and vertical ranging behaviour with longer waiting times than R. montagui, who inhabited deeper more restricted depths. Comparatively, however, teleosts showed more extensive vertical ranging and much shorter waiting time behaviour, with P. maxima displaying surface swimming, whilst P. platessa performed substantial circa-­‐diel and tidal rhythms. The differences in behaviour patterns observed was attributed to feeding niche differences, among intraspecific variation such as sexual segregation and ontogenic changes. This integrated statistical approach to understand the behavioural strategies of these sit-­‐ and-­‐wait predators helps to assess aspects of behaviour such as decision-­‐making (waiting time between activities) in relation to habitat availability and quality. A deeper understanding of spatiotemporal movements and behaviour, including where species are distributed, how long they stay there and why, will inform better management of populations.

40|$|Skates {{are widely}} {{consumed}} across the globe, but many large species {{are subject to}} considerable concern regarding their conservation and management. Within Europe such issues have recently driven policy changes so that, for the first time, reports of skate landings now {{have to be made}} under species-specific names. Total allowable catches have also been established for many groups, which have been set to zero for a number of the most vulnerable species (e. g., Dipturus batis, Raja undulata and Rostoraja alba). Whilst accurate species identification has become an important issue for landings, the sale of skates is still usually made under a blanket term of “skate” or “ray”. The matter of identifying species of skate is further complicated by their morphologically conservative nature {{and the fact that they}} are commercially valued for their wings. Thus, before sale their bodies are usually discarded (i. e., “winged”) and often skinned, making morphological identification impossible. For the first time, DNA barcoding (of the mitochondrial COI gene) was applied to samples of skate wings from retail outlets across the British Isles, providing insight into which species are sold for consumption. A total of 98 wing samples were analysed, revealing that six species were sold; blonde ray (<b>Raja</b> <b>brachyura),</b> spotted ray (Raja montagui), thornback ray (Raja clavata), cuckoo ray (Leucoraja naevus) small-eyed ray (Raja microocellata) and shagreen ray (Leucoraja fullonica). Statistical testing demonstrated that there were significant differences in the species sold in the distinct retail groups which suggests complex drivers behind the patterns of sale in skates. The results also indicate that endangered species are not commonly being passed on to consumers. In addition, the practice of selling skate wings under ambiguous labels is highlighted as it makes it extremely difficult for consumers to exercise a right to avoid species of conservation concern. Interestingly, a single retailer chain labelled their wings as originating from three smaller-growing species (generally to be considered of lower conservation concern); of the six samples analysed from this company a third were mislabelled and originated from the thornback ray (a larger species that is currently undergoing population declines) ...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação de mest., Biologia Marinha, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Univ. do Algarve, 2010 Skate populations tend to {{be highly}} {{vulnerable}} to exploitation {{as a result of}} the main life history characteristics (slow growth, late maturity and low fecundity). The cuckoo ray, Leucoraja naevus, one of the skate species landed in Portugal, is mainly a by-catch species from the artisanal mixed-fishery, and for this reason it is very difficult to acquire information about its basic biology. The two main goals of the present work were to estimate the length at first maturity, fecundity and reproductive cycle of the species Leucoraja naevus and to compare the microscopic structure and chemical nature of the secretions produced by the oviducal gland of the species Leucoraja naevus with other skate species taking into account their reproductive strategy. Although the species has been studied in other NE Atlantic geographic areas, namely Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and North Sea, this study is the first to provide information on the reproductive biology of Leucoraja naevus in Southern European waters. Length at first maturity was estimated at 57 cm and 55 cm TL for males and females, respectively. Active females were observed in every months of the year suggesting that reproduction may occur year round, with a reproductive peak during winter months between January and April. Females release follicles in batches of 5. However, it was not possible to determine the number of reproductive episodes realized by a female during a 1 -year period. Leucoraja naevus, <b>Raja</b> <b>brachyura,</b> Raja miraletus, Raja undulata, Raja microocellata and Raja montagui, have similar microscopic structure divided in four zones: club, papillary, baffle and terminal. However, differences were found between Leucoraja naevus and the remaining species in the chemical nature of the secretions produced in the papillary zone, that seems to have a higher content of sulphated acid mucins, and in the terminal zone that, like in Raja microocellata, lacks serous gland tubules. The differences found are related with the reproductive strategy displayed by each species, namely with the capsule and spawning habitats characteristics. Sperm was found in all species as laterally aligned bundles in the deep recessed tubules of the baffle zone, adjacent to the muscle layer, suggesting short-term sperm storage. These results provide essential information on the reproductive biology not only about the species Leucoraja naevus but also about other by-catch species inhabiting Portuguese continental waters and, therefore, constitute an important tool for a proper management plan...|$|E
40|$|Chondrichthyes make {{up one of}} {{the oldest}} and most ecologically diverse {{vertebrate}} lineages: they arose at least 420 million years ago and rapidly radiated out to occupy the upper tiers of aquatic food webs (Compagno, 1990; Kriwet et al., 2008; Dulvy et al., 2013). Today, this group of predators plays important functional roles in the control of coastal and oceanic ecosystems (Stevens et al., 2000; Ferretti et al., 2010; Heithaus et al., 2012). They are an important resource, and constitute a significant fraction of the by-catch, which for decades has been undergoing an increase in mortality that has altered the relative abundance and structure of the their worldwide population. This is mainly due to their K-selected life-history strategy that makes them extremely vulnerable and not very resilient to the high rates of mortality due to fishing (Musick, 1999; Cortés, 2002; Dulvy and Forrest, 2010). The knowledge of the biological parameters related to the reproductive biology (life-history traits) and the state of the populations of these marine organisms are essential to plan proper management of fisheries. Sardinian seas represent a small biodiversity hotspot in the central western Mediterranean, as well as being an important junction of the two basin sides (West and East). The high richness of chondrichthyan species which inhabit these waters combined with the absence of protection measures, has provided an opportunity to undertake a study on the status of these marine predators, in order to establish a starting point for a correct management, studying biological parameters. This aim was achieved conducting specific analysis on sexual maturity going to deepen aspects on their reproductive strategies. The results on the abundance trends of demersal cartilaginous fish inhabiting the Sardinian waters, were at first useful to identify the most abundant species for which the information on the reproductive cycle and parameters are scarce or fragmented in the literature (Dipturus oxyrinchus, Etmopterus spinax, Galeus melastomus, <b>Raja</b> <b>brachyura,</b> R. miraletus and Squalus blainville). All these species are included in the IUCN red lists. The adoption of standardized maturity scales for oviparous and viviparous species, through the observation of macroscopic reproductive systems, supported by histological analysis, were crucial for the correct attribution of maturity stages that allowed to discern the different phases of their life cycle and to identify the main reproductive parameters. The latter revealed a generalized vulnerability to fish mortality in all studied species. Specifically, skates and sharks shown a very late achievement of sexual maturity, in both sexes, with L 50 generally higher than 80...|$|E
40|$|Elasmobranchs, due {{to their}} K-selected life strategy, {{represent}} a taxonomic group particularly susceptible to fishing mortality (Cahmi et al., 1998). Although {{the increasing number of}} studies that shows a global collapse of their populations (Dulvy & Reynolds, 2002; Baum et al., 2003; Cortés, et al., 2002, 2006; Dulvy et al., 2010), our knowledge about this organisms life-cycle seems surprisingly still scarce (Frisk et al., 2010; Cortés et al., 2012). Among elasmobranchs the Rajidae family is generally identified {{as one of the most}} vulnerable and impacted (Dulvy & Reynolds, 2002). Given the wide-ranging decline in terms of abundance, diversity and distribution observed, the skates stocks appear even in more critical condition in the Mediterranean sea (Walker et al., 2005). For this reason the need for management plans seems clear. However this kind of measures necessitate a precise evaluation of the population‟s condition, through a stock assessment process. Nevertheless such analysis require a huge amount of data regarding some peculiar aspects of the studied species life-cycle, and among these, especially growth parameters. This necessity often represented a problem for stock assessment studies. Indeed the estimation of age and growth for elasmobranchs is considered generally more challenging than in teleosts (Campana, 2014). Therefore the first step of this work was represented by the estimation of age and growth, through annuli counts in the vertebral centra of the three selected skates species: <b>Raja</b> <b>brachyura,</b> Raja polystigma, Dipturus oxyrinchus. Four different models were applied on length at age data: the common von Bertalanffy growth function, the Exponential, and finally the Gompertz and the Logistic functions. According to the Akaike‟s Information Criterion, the classical von Bertalanffy growth function, showed the best fitting to the observed data for R. brachyura (L∞= 1113. 4 mm, k= 0. 10 e t 0 = - 1. 19). On the other hand the growth of the other two species resulted better described by the S-shaped functions, respectively the Gompertz model for D. oxyrinchus (L∞= 1275. 5 mm, k= 0. 14 and 2 Inflection Point = 3. 97), and the Logistic model for R. polystigma (L∞= 691. 49 mm, k= 0. 26 and Inflection Point = 4. 03). The obtained growth parameter were employed in several analysis for stock assessment. Those analysis revealed a general high exploitation level for Sardinian skates populations. Indeed both species R. brachyura and R. polystigma seemed to be in an overfishing condition. These results, in addition with what already reported for other two raids, R. asterias and R. clavata, in the GFCM workshop on the stock assessment of selected species of elasmobranchs (GFCM:SAC 14 / 2012 /Inf. 16) confirmed the critical situation of these organisms in the Mediterranean sea. D. oxyrinchus, instead, showed a healthy stock state not subjected to overexploitation. This result was also confirmed by the biomass and abundance trends, which proved to be stable for the entire time period investigated by MEDITS, in agreement with what reported by Follesa et al. (2013) in Sardinia and Relini et al. (2010) for the Italian coasts. In conclusion, this work represents a first step towards a better understanding of the growth and the life cycle of the Rajidae family in the Mediterranean Sea, these knowledge were then applied to the stock assessment of these organisms in order to provide several advices for a conscious and correct management of their fragile populations...|$|E
