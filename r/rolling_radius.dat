50|$|Replacing {{the wheels}} {{on a car}} with larger ones, {{normally}} for a perceived improvement in appearance, also involves using tires with a reduced profile number (often as low as 35%) to keep the overall <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> within a few per cent of the original tire. If this is not done, gearing and speedometer accuracy are affected. All other things being equal, larger replacement wheels give a harsher ride because of the shorter and stiffer tire sidewall, in exchange for better handling and higher cornering limits due to the lower sidewall flex. In contrast, a car designed to have large wheels from the outset may have a more normal tire profile and gives a smoother ride due to the larger <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> of the tire.|$|E
50|$|One way to {{estimate}} wheel diameter {{is to add}} twice the nominal tyre cross-section to the rim diameter. For example, consider a 700c &times; 23 mm tire, which has a nominal cross-section of 23 mm. 700c wheels have a rim diameter of 622 mm. Hence the wheel diameter is (2 &times; 23 mm) + 622 mm = 668 mm which is equal to 26.3 inches (rounded to 1 decimal place). 26 inch mountain bicycle wheels have a rim diameter of 559 mm. This ignores {{factors that contribute to}} the actual <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> of the tyre and rim together: the vertical deflection of the tire above the contact patch and the difference between the manufacturer's stated size and the actual tire radius when mounted and inflated.|$|E
50|$|Insofar as the {{tangential}} force {{is the one}} acting {{in the direction of}} travel, {{tangential force}} variation describes the change in this force as the tire rotates under load. As the tire rotates and spring elements with different spring constants enter and exit the contact area, the tangential force will change. As the tire rotates it exerts a high traction force to accelerate the vehicle and maintain its speed under constant velocity. Under steady-state conditions it would be typical for the force to vary up and down from this value. This variation would be characterized as TFV. In a constant velocity test condition, TFV would be manifested as a small speed fluctuation occurring every rotation due to the change in <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> of the tire. TFV is not measured in production testing.|$|E

40|$|We study <b>rolling</b> <b>radii</b> {{solutions}} {{in the context}} of the four – and five–dimensional effective actions of heterotic M–theory. For the standard four–dimensional solutions with varying dilaton and T–modulus, we find approximate five–dimensional counterparts. These are new, generically non– separating solutions corresponding to a pair of five–dimensional domain walls evolving in time. Loop corrections in the four–dimensional theory are described by certain excitations of fields in the fifth dimension. We point out that the two exact separable solutions previously discovered are precisely the special cases for which the loop corrections are time–independent. Generically, loop corrections vary with time. Moreover, for a subset of solutions they increase in time, evolving into complicated, non-separating solutions. In this paper we compute these solutions to leading, non-trivial order. Using the equations for the induced brane metric, we present a general argument showing that the Among the simplest cosmological solutions of string theory are the so called <b>rolling</b> <b>radii</b> solutions [1].

40|$|A {{method for}} {{optimizing}} rail profiles to improve vehicle running stability in switch panel of high-speed railway turnouts is proposed in this paper. The stock rail profiles are optimized {{to decrease the}} <b>rolling</b> <b>radii</b> difference (RRD). Such characteristics are defined through given rail profiles, and the target <b>rolling</b> <b>radii</b> difference {{is defined as a}} function of lateral displacements of wheel set. The improved sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method is used to generate a sequence of improving profiles leading to the optimum one. The wheel-rail contact geometry and train-turnout dynamic interaction of the optimized profiles and those of nominal profiles are calculated for comparison. Without lateral displacement of wheel set, the maximum RRD in relation to a nominal profile will be kept within 0. 5 [*]mm– 1 [*]mm, while that in relation to an optimized profile will be kept within 0. 3 [*]mm– 0. 5 [*]mm. For the facing and trailing move of vehicle passing the switch panel in the through route, the lateral wheel-rail contact force is decreased by 34. 0 % and 29. 9 %, respectively, the lateral acceleration of car body is decreased by 41. 9 % and 40. 7 %, respectively, and the optimized profile will not greatly influence the vertical wheel-rail contact force. The proposed method works efficiently and the results prove to be quite reasonable...|$|R

A helical pattern was used to avoid the uneven <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> and vibration of a tread with simple crosswise bars and large gaps between. This helical pattern also {{gave rise to a}} sideways force, particularly on tarmac. As all tyres had the same 'hand', this force increased across {{the two sides of the}} vehicle. To counteract this force, the central stop-rib was added. The stop-rib was only partly successful though; snowy conditions led the Swiss Post Office to use left- and right-handed tyres to balance the force across the vehicle. Later developments would use balanced arrangements of ribs in a chevron or herringbone layout. The more common arrangement for the later low-speed military bar grip was to use straight bars, but relying on the centre rib to avoid their vibration problems on tarmac.|$|E
50|$|NIRA Dynamics' {{core product}} is its Tire Pressure Indicator (TPI), an {{indirect}} tire-pressure monitoring system (TPMS) capable of detecting underinflation simultaneously {{in up to}} four tires. At the moment, TPI is installed in several Audi models (the A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, Q3, Q5, Q7, and TT); several Volkswagen models (Polo, Golf, Jetta, Beetle, Scirocco, Passat, Tiguan, Touran, and Sharan); several SEAT and Skoda models; {{as well as the}} Chery Arrizo 7 and the MG 3. It is also fitted to many Volvo, Fiat and Renault vehicles. The system meets the American FMVSS 138 and the European ECE R-64 regulations on tire pressure monitoring systems. TPI is a software component that uses both relative <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> information as well as wheel oscillation measurement. It estimates tire pressure mainly from the signals of the wheel speed sensors {{that are part of the}} anti-lock braking system (ABS) and electronic stability control system (ESC). It gets active shortly after a reset which triggers a self-learning process. A reset needs to be initiated by the driver when the tires have been changed or the pressure adjusted. TPI does not require any in-wheel pressure sensors and RF (radio frequency) components. The Audi TT series was the first to be equipped with TPI, in 2006. The Audi A4 and A5 models followed the next year. TPI can be fit into different electronic stability control hardware hosts, including those of Continental AG, Robert Bosch GmbH, and TRW Automotive.|$|E

The thesis describes the post-processing method to analyze the percentage of wheel slip and identify the effective <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> and the longitudinal tire stiffness for maximum tire life and performance. Driving and braking behaviour of vehicle were both studied in this thesis for paved and unpaved sandy road condition which commonly the contributing factors to the wheel slip to occur. The data used for the analysis is obtained through experimental test using UMP Test Car which has been installed with Wheel Pulse Transducer, Global Positioning System and DEWESOFT software for data acquisition purpose. The post-processing method was performed using Flexpro and Microsoft Office Excel. The post-processing method to analyze the percentage of wheel slip was performed using the SAE definition of wheel slip and the percent error in the distance travel by the car between free rolling and actual condition. Finally, the longitudinal force, the effective <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> and the longitudinal tire stiffness was determined for both driving and braking maneuver of vehicle on paved and unpaved sandy road condition. From the results, {{it is observed that}} the percentage of wheel slip during driving maneuver is higher for unpaved sandy road condition compares to that the paved road. It is also observed that the longitudinal force of the tire is lower for unpaved sandy road compare to the paved road condition. The effective <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> of the tire during driving maneuver was determined to be lower compare to the free <b>rolling</b> <b>radius</b> of the tire.

40|$|Abstract: Lateral forces between {{wheels and}} rails must be reduced {{in order that}} rolling stock runs safely and {{smoothly}} on curved tracks. The excessive lateral force will cause not only derail-ment of rolling stock but also destruction of tracks, rail corrugation, track irregularity, squeal noise and wear. It is important to reduce lateral force of wheels in curves, so new wheel-tread profiles and steerable bogie structures have been developed up to now, however, they cannot solve various problems in curving perfectly. In this article, the authors propose three methods for improvement of running performance on curves by using existing types of wheels and rails, and analyse the effects of three methods by numerical simulation.

40|$|Many {{theories}} of particle physics {{rely on the}} existence of more than three spatial dimensions. In this thesis we consider various aspects of the cosmologies associated with such theories. The extra dimensions must be hidden in some manner and in all the cases we shall consider this is achieved by the mechanism of compactification. We start by considering a possible description of the quantum mechanical creation of such universes. A consistent description of this type would be extremely desirable because it would remove the vacua selection problems which plague such theories, increasing their predictive power markedly. The formalism we employ is that due to Hartle and Hawking. We are able to illustrate a serious problem in combining this approach to quantum cosmology with higher dimensional theories. We find that, for the wide range of theories considered, the Hartle Hawking proposal predicts that we should directly observe all the dimensions of space. This is clearly inconsistent with observation. We then proceed to consider the evolution of various examples of higher dimensional cosmologies. All the examples considered contain brane sources. We start with a simple example of such a theory in order to examine an inflationary scenario that has been proposed in the literature. This scenario utilises the large extra dimensions which are possible in brane world theories in an attempt to solve some of the fine tuning problems which occur in inflationary models. Having introduced the study of the evolution of such models in a simple context we then go on to study a more realistic case. We present, {{with a wide variety of}} generalisations, cosmological solutions which are the analogues of the <b>rolling</b> <b>radii</b> solutions of string cosmology for the case where five branes are present in the bulk of the Heterotic M-theory orbifold.
