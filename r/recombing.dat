40|$|A typical gas sales {{agreement}} (GSA) also called a gas swing contract, is {{an agreement between}} a supplier and a purchaser for the delivery of variable daily quantities of gas, between specified minimum and maximum daily limits, over {{a certain number of}} years at a specified set of contract prices. The main constraint of such an agreement that makes them difficult to value are that in each gas year there is a minimum volume of gas (termed take-or-pay or minimum bill) for which the buyer will be charged {{at the end of the}} year (or penalty date), regardless of the actual quantity of gas taken. We propose a framework for pricing such swing contracts for an underlying gas forward price curve that follows a regime-switching process in order to better capture the volatility behaviour in such markets. With the help of a <b>recombing</b> pentanonial tree, we are able to efficiently evaluate the prices of the swing contracts, find optimal daily decisions and optimaly early use of both the make-up bank and the carry forward bank at different regimes. We also show how the change of regime will affect the decisions. gas {{sales agreement}}; swing contract; take-or-pay; make-up; carry forward; forward price curve; regime switching volatility; <b>recombing</b> pentanomial tree...|$|E

40|$|A {{binomial}} tree {{approach to}} stochastic volatility driven {{model of the}} stock price Ionut ̧ Florescu and Frederi Viens Abstract. In this article we attempt {{to deal with the}} problem of finding option prices when the volatility component of the price is stochastic. The model we use is: dSt = µStdt + σ(Yt) StdWt, where Yt is a mean-reverting type process. First, we show how to estimate the distribution of the volatility component, using an algorithm due to Del Moral, Jacod and Protter [6]. Second, using this distributon we are able to construct a binomial tree model which converges to the solution of the given equation. In order to price options on the stock, we use the Monte Carlo method to sample from this tree, and obtain a smaller, <b>recombing</b> tree easier to work with. Finally, we use this method to compute the price of European Call Options on the SP 500 index price in April. We use daily data and our method gives good results that are proximate to the reported bid-ask spread...|$|E

40|$|This {{funding was}} support for student and {{postdoctoral}} {{attendance at the}} Annual <b>Recomb</b> Conference from 2001 to 2005. The <b>RECOMB</b> Conference series was founded in 1997 to provide a scientific forum for theoretical advances in computational biology and their applications in molecular biology and medicine. The conference series aims at attracting research contributions {{in all areas of}} computational molecular biology. Typical, but not exclusive, the topics of interest are: Genomics, Molecular sequence analysis, Recognition of genes and regulatory elements, Molecular evolution, Protein structure, Structural genomics, Gene Expression, Gene Networks, Drug Design, Combinatorial libraries, Computational proteomics, and Structural and functional genomics. The origins of the conference came from the mathematical and computational side of the field, and there remains to be a certain focus on computational advances. However, the effective use of computational techniques to biological innovation is also an important aspect of the conference. The conference had a growing number of attendees, topping 300 in recent years and often exceeding 500. The conference program includes between 30 and 40 contributed papers, that are selected by a international program committee with around 30 experts during a rigorous review process rivaling the editorial procedure for top-rate scientific journals. In previous years papers selection has been made from up to 130 [...] 200 submissions from well over a dozen countries. 10 -page extended abstracts of the contributed papers are collected in a volume published by ACM Press and Springer, and are available at the conference. Full versions of a selection of the papers are published annually in a special issue of the Journal of Computational Biology devoted to the <b>RECOMB</b> Conference. A further point in the program is a lively poster session. From 120 - 300 posters have been presented each year at <b>RECOMB</b> 2000. One of the highlights of each <b>RECOMB</b> conference is a collection of nine keynotes awarded to researchers of highest international esteem who are asked to inform the community about landmark advances in computational and experimental research and inject new directions into the field of computational molecular biology.

40|$|LNCS v. 6044 is conference {{proceedings}} of 14 th <b>RECOMB</b> 2010 The de Bruijn graph assembly approach breaks reads into k-mers before assembling them into contigs. The string graph approach forms contigs by connecting two reads with k or more overlapping nucleotides. Both approaches {{must deal with}} the following problems: false-positive vertices, due to erroneous reads; gap problem, due to non-uniform coverage; branching problem, due to erroneous reads and repeat regions. A proper choice of k is crucial but for single k {{there is always a}} trade-off: a small k favors the situation of erroneous reads and non-uniform coverage, and a large k favors short repeat regions. We propose an iterative de Bruijn graph approach iterating from small to large k exploring the advantages of the in between values. Our IDBA outperforms the existing algorithms by constructing longer contigs with similar accuracy and using less memory, both with real and simulated data.

40|$|Abstract The String Barcoding (SBC) problem, {{introduced}} by Rash and Gusfield (<b>RECOMB,</b> 2002), consists {{in finding a}} minimum set of substrings {{that can be used}} to distinguish between all members of a set of given strings. In a computational biology context, the given strings represent a set of known viruses, while the substrings can be used as probes for an hybridization experiment via microarray. Eventually, one aims at the classification of new strings (unknown viruses) through the result of the hybridization experiment. In this paper we show that SBC is as hard to approximate as Set Cover. Furthermore, we show that the constrained version of SBC (with probes of bounded length) is also hard to approximate. These negative results are tight. </p...|$|R

These networks can be placed into various mathematical frameworks, of which the constraintbased framework [1] has received the most attention over the past 15 years.

Metabolic models can yield predictions of two types: quantitative, such as {{the growth rate of}} an organism under given experimental conditions [2], and qualitative, such as the viability of a mutant [3] or minimal media required for growth [4]. Qualitative predictions, on which we focus, tend to be more robust and reliable than quantitative ones, while remaining experimentally testable and biologically relevant. 15 th Annual International Conference, <b>RECOMB</b> 2011, Vancouver, BC, Canada, March 28 - 31, 2011.

We {{show that this}} improves detection of genomic copy number variants (CNV) in array CGH experiments compared to the state-of-the-art, including standard Gibbs sampling. The method concentrates computational effort on chromosomal segments which are difficult to call, by dynamically and adaptively recomputing consecutive blocks of observations likely to share a copy number. This makes routine diagnostic use and re-analysis of legacy data collections feasible; to this end, we also propose an effective automatic prior.

The method is straightforward to program and has been fully implemented. Simulations show that it is much faster in practice than prior nonlinear methods.
