40|$|Reliable {{reference}} profiles {{and estimates}} of variability are {{a necessity for}} a variety of processes relating to ENVISAT including the development of key aspects and inputs for the operational processor for the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding. MIPAS <b>reference</b> <b>atmospheres</b> have therefore been produced in two forms, namely standard atmospheres for modelling and error analysis for typical atmospheric situations and the IG 2 seasonal climatologies for initial guess profiles used as part of the operational processing. The reference states cover 36 species on a common altitude, pressure, and temperature grid from 0 to 120 km, and include both means and estimates of variability (maximum, minimum and one sigma values). This paper describes V 3. 1 of the standard atmospheres and V 4. 0 of the IG 2 atmospheres which are the current versions of the <b>reference</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> Particular attention is paid to the MIPAS operational geophysical products (pressure/temperature, H 2 O, O 3, CH 4, N 2 O, HNO 3 and NO 2) and to CO 2 whose mixing ratio is required for the retrieval of pressure and temperature. A dynamic representation of CO 2 is presented which shows the presence of CO 2 gradients in the troposphere and the lower stratosphere. Since these atmospheres have been produced independently of MIPAS data, it is also possible to compare the data to the MIPAS operational products and derive valuable information on both the <b>reference</b> <b>atmospheres</b> and on MIPAS data products themselves. This process has been performed for V 4. 61 /V 4. 62 data from the year 2003 as part of the MIPAS validation activity. It is demonstrated that the agreement between the MIPAS mean data and the <b>reference</b> <b>atmospheres</b> is very good in mid-latitudes and the tropics, verifying these data to first order. There is also reasonable agreement in standard deviations between the IG 2 atmospheres and the corresponding sigmas calculated from the MIPAS data. Knowledge of tropospheric concentrations of CH 4 and N 2 O is used to examine the accuracy of the MIPAS data and their susceptibility to cloud effects. It is shown that for the highest accuracy, MIPAS data should be filtered with cloud index values of 2. 5 for N 2 O and 3. 5 for CH 4. Once such filtering has been performed, the MIPAS data for these species appear to be accurate to within 10 % in the upper troposphere. The use of cloud index data in combination with MIPAS data is recommended for studies of the polar winter stratosphere and the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} ten years a total of 25 {{sounding}} rockets employing ionization gauges have been launched at high latitudes (~ 70 ° N) to measure total atmospheric density and its small scale fluctuations in an altitude range between 70 and 110 km. While the determination of small scale fluctuations is unambiguous, the total density analysis has been complicated in the past by aerodynamical disturbances leading to densities inside the sensor which are enhanced compared to atmospheric values. Here, we present the results of both Monte Carlo simulations and wind tunnel measurements to quantify this aerodynamical effect. The comparison of the resulting ?ram-factor' profiles with empirically determined density ratios of ionization gauge measurements and falling sphere measurements provides excellent agreement. This demonstrates both the need, but also the possibility, to correct aerodynamical influences on measurements from sounding rockets. We have determined a total of 20 density profiles of the mesosphere-lower-thermosphere (MLT) region. Grouping these profiles according to season, a listing of mean density profiles is included in the paper. A comparison with density profiles taken from the <b>reference</b> <b>atmospheres</b> CIRA 86 and MSIS 90 results in differences of up to 40 %.

Presence and variations of SO 2 could be the proof of a possible volcanism on Venus. The most intriguing are discrepancies among different observations, and the suspected long-term variations of the SO 2 abundance observed on the scales of several years, in particular during Pioneer Venus Orbiter and Venus Express missions. Similar trends are also observed in the super-rotation period and circulation patterns, which suggest that these aspects may be more strongly coupled than expected. An ISSI international team has been built in view of considering different aspects of sulfur chemistry on Venus.

Clouds affect {{the appearance of the}} measured spectra at all wavelengths which are sensitive to emission from the layer of atmosphere containing the cloud. Both low resolution (cloud continuum) and high resolution features (complicated spectral lineshapes) can be observed due to the MIPAS resolution of 0. 025 cm- 1 (unapodized). This has two implications. Firstly, spectra containing clouds can affect the quality of the operational trace gas retrievals. Therefore clouds must be identified and flagged prior to retrievals of trace gas concentrations at level 2; thin clouds may be allowed if the retrieval accuracy/stability for trace gases remains good. Secondly, the cloud information constitutes a valuable product in itself. In this report, the development and verification of a successful MIPAS cloud detection scheme is reported. Retrieval simulations and analysis of the MIPAS level 2 data are examined to demonstrate the effects of the clouds {{and the quality of the}} data given cloud flagging.

The model is very flexible {{and can be used}} for computing very accurate non-LIE populations or for calculating reasonably accurate but at high speed non-LIE populations in order to implement it into non-LIE remote sensing retrievals. We describe the model in detail and present an update of the non-LIE collisional processes and their rate coefficients for the most important molecules in Earth's atmosphere. In addition, we have applied the model to the most important atmospheric infrared emitters including 13 species (H 2 O, CO 2, O- 3, N 2 O, CO, CH 4, O- 2, NO, NO 2, HNO 3, OH, N- 2, and HCN) and 460 excited vibrational or electronic energy levels. Non-LIE populations for all these energy levels have been calculated for 48 <b>reference</b> <b>atmospheres</b> expanding from the surface up to 200 km, including seasonal (January, April, July and October), latitudinal (75 degrees S, 45 degrees S, 10 degrees S, 10 degrees N, 45 degrees N, 75 degrees N) and diurnal (day and night) coverages. The effects of the most recent updates of the non-LIE collisional parameters on the non-LIE populations are briefly described.

40|$|Acceleration {{effects are}} found in the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) magnetogram data because changes in the line {{profiles}} during the 30 -s measurement are introduced by underlying p-mode velocity variations. This imparts an oscillatory component to the magnetic flux signal. Simulated profiles using Maltby M and Harvard Smithsonian <b>Reference</b> <b>Atmospheres</b> (HSRA) are shifted in accordance with a given velocity amplitude and period and the MDI algorithm for data measurement is applied. The simulated oscillatory component to the magnetic flux density always has a phase difference with respect to the underlying velocity of − 90 ◦. The maximum introduced RMS amplitude is a function of velocity amplitude and field strength, but realistic errors are on the order of 5 / 2000 G, or 0. 25 % of field strength. Comparison of simulations with observations shows RMS amplitudes of MDI flux density are much greater than predicted by this effect. A 2 -component HSRA model, tested to determine if stronger fields with smaller fill factors could fit the data, still can not reproduce the observations. It is concluded that oscillatory amplitudes of magnetic flux density measured with MDI are not due to acceleration effects, although the effect could contribute up to 25 % of the measured amplitude. Attempts to remove acceleration effects from the magnetic flux signal are not successful. Also, we confirm that velocities measured in linearly polarized light in the vicinity of a strong magnetic field contain larger errors than velocities measured in circularly polarized light (Yang and Norton, 2001) ...|$|R
