5|$|Malvern {{experienced}} a further population boost in 1942 when the Telecommunications <b>Research</b> <b>Establishment</b> (TRE) relocated to Malvern bringing 2,500 employees to Malvern, increasing to around 3,500 by 1945.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Scandinavian {{countries}} {{formed the}} Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1957, with Bohr as its chairman. He was also {{involved with the}} founding of the <b>Research</b> <b>Establishment</b> Risø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission, and served as its first chairman from February 1956.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s RAF Aldermaston {{was created}} on the parkland at the {{southern}} end of the parish, with XIX Tactical Air Command stationed at the manor house. After World War II, the manor was returned to AEI who built the MERLIN reactor on part of the land. The reactor was opened on 6 November 1959 by The Duke of Edinburgh. With the opening of the Atomic Weapons <b>Research</b> <b>Establishment</b> (AWRE) in 1950, Aldermaston became synonymous with a number of CND marches.|$|E

5|$|Fleming made {{a number}} of revelations about Bond's {{character}} within the book, including showing an emotional side that was not present in the previous stories. In common with Fleming's other Bond stories, he used the names and places of people he knew or had heard of and Blofeld's research station on Piz Gloria was based on Schloss Mittersill, which the Nazis had turned into a <b>research</b> <b>establishment</b> examining the Asiatic races.|$|E
5|$|One final {{consequence}} of the raid was that the Telecommunications <b>Research</b> <b>Establishment,</b> {{where much of the}} Bruneval equipment was analysed, and British radar systems were designed and tested, was moved further inland from Swanage on the southern coast of England to Malvern to ensure that it was not the target of a reprisal raid by German airborne forces.|$|E
5|$|Sam {{worked at}} the Atomic Weapons <b>Research</b> <b>Establishment</b> at Aldermaston on the {{development}} of the British hydrogen bomb from 1955 to 1959. He returned to Glasgow in 1959 as principal the Royal College of Science and Technology. When it became the University of Strathclyde in 1964, the first new university in Scotland in 384 years, he became its first Principal and Vice Chancellor. While her husband was Principal, Joan founded the Strathclyde Women's Group and became its president.|$|E

5|$|Since 1942 {{research}} and development into physics and electronics has been {{the major source of}} employment in Malvern when during World War II the Telecommunications <b>Research</b> <b>Establishment</b> (TRE) moved from Worth Matravers on the south coast for safety from enemy action. Its staff worked on airborne radar and other electronic warfare resources for the RAF.|$|E
5|$|The NPL did {{not have}} the {{expertise}} to build a machine like ACE, so they contacted Tommy Flowers at the General Post Office's (GPO) Dollis Hill Research Laboratory. Flowers, the designer of Colossus, the world's first programmable electronic computer, was committed elsewhere and was unable {{to take part in the}} project, although his team did build some mercury delay lines for ACE. The Telecommunications <b>Research</b> <b>Establishment</b> (TRE) was also approached for assistance, as was Maurice Wilkes at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Through this period, Rowe finally {{concluded}} that Dundee was unsuitable {{for any of}} the researchers, and decided to move again. This time he selected Worth Matravers on the southern coast, where all of the radar teams could once again work together. Due to confused timing and better planning {{on the part of the}} AI team, they arrived at Worth Matravers from St Athan before the long convoy from Dundee could make its way south. This caused a traffic jam that further upset Rowe. Nevertheless, everything was set up by the end of May 1940, with the AI team working primarily from huts south of Worth Matravers, and carrying out installations at a nearby airfield. With this move the entire group became the Ministry of Aircraft Production <b>Research</b> <b>Establishment</b> (MAPRE), only to be renamed again as the Telecommunications <b>Research</b> <b>Establishment</b> (TRE) in November 1940.|$|E
40|$|The {{roles and}} {{structure}} of government defence <b>research</b> <b>establishments</b> are being redefined in several European countries. So far, large-scale government controlled defence <b>research</b> <b>establishments</b> have played a key function {{in the development of}} technological capabilities in the defence field. These organisations are now facing downsizing drives as well as attempts at injecting a commercial logic into their operations. As a consequence their relationships with government defence agencies and defence industrial suppliers are changing. This paper analyses these changes with special reference to the British case, and explores their potential implications for European research policy.

5|$|After the war Cockcroft {{became the}} {{director}} of the Atomic Energy <b>Research</b> <b>Establishment</b> (AERE) at Harwell, where the low-powered, graphite-moderated GLEEP became the first nuclear reactor to operate in western Europe when it was started on 15 August 1947. This was followed by BEPO in 1948. Harwell was involved {{in the design of the}} reactors and the chemical separation plant at Windscale. Under his direction it took part in frontier fusion research, including the ZETA program. His insistence that the chimney stacks of the Windscale reactors be fitted with filters was mocked as Cockcroft's Folly until the core of one of the reactors ignited and released radionuclides during the Windscale fire of 1957.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} his Bond books, Fleming used events or names from his life in his writing. In the 1930s, Fleming often visited Kitzbühel in Austria to ski; he once {{deliberately}} set off down a slope that had been closed because {{of the danger of}} an avalanche. The snow cracked behind him and an avalanche came down, catching him at its end: Fleming remembered the incident and it was used for Bond's escape from Piz Gloria. Fleming would occasionally stay at the sports club of Schloss Mittersill in the Austrian Alps; in 1940 the Nazis closed down the club {{and turned it into a}} <b>research</b> <b>establishment</b> examining the Asiatic races. It was this pseudo-scientific research centre that inspired Blofeld's own centre of Piz Gloria.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, Bohr helped {{refugees}} from Nazism. After Denmark {{was occupied by}} the Germans, he had a famous meeting with Heisenberg, who had become {{the head of the}} German nuclear weapon project. In September 1943, word reached Bohr {{that he was about to}} be arrested by the Germans, and he fled to Sweden. From there, he was flown to Britain, where he joined the British Tube Alloys nuclear weapons project, and was part of the British mission to the Manhattan Project. After the war, Bohr called for international cooperation on nuclear energy. He was involved with the establishment of CERN and the <b>Research</b> <b>Establishment</b> Risø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission and became the first chairman of the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1957.|$|E

5|$|He {{was highly}} {{regarded}} as a scientist by the British, who wanted {{him to return to}} the United Kingdom to work on Britain's post-war nuclear weapons program; he returned in August 1946 and became the head of the Theoretical Physics Division at the Atomic Energy <b>Research</b> <b>Establishment</b> at Harwell. From late 1947 to May 1949 he gave Alexander Feklisov, his Soviet case officer, the principal theoretical outline for creating a hydrogen bomb and the initial drafts for its development as the work progressed in England and America. Meeting with Feklisov six times, he provided the results of the test at Eniwetok Atoll of uranium and plutonium bombs and the key data on production of uranium-235.|$|E
5|$|On graduation, Kilburn was {{recruited}} by C.P. Snow. He {{was given a}} quick course in electronics, and was posted to the Telecommunications <b>Research</b> <b>Establishment</b> (TRE) in Malvern, where he worked on radar in Group 19 under Frederic Calland Williams. The group was responsible for designing and debugging electronic circuitry. Although Williams was initially disappointed at being given someone with so little practical experience, Kilburn became a valued member of the team. On 14 August 1943, he married Irene Marsden, a shop assistant. They went on to raise a son, John, and a daughter, Anne.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Laboratory {{had been}} a {{fruitful}} and successful international venture, although the Canadians had on occasion been resentful of British actions that were perceived as high-handed and insensitive. One such action came in November 1945 when the British government suddenly announced that Cockcroft {{had been a}}ppointed {{the head of the}} new Atomic Energy <b>Research</b> <b>Establishment</b> in Britain without any prior consultation {{and at a time when}} the NRX reactor was still under construction. Cockcroft did not depart Canada until September 1946, but it was a sure sign of waning British interest in collaboration with Canada. The British suggested he be replaced by the British physicist Bennett Lewis, who was eventually appointed, but only after the Canadian-born Walter Zinn turned the job down.|$|E

5|$|The Radar Research and Development Establishment (RRDE), which {{worked on}} {{anti-aircraft}} radar and searchlights for the Army, {{was moved to}} Malvern at the same time. Initially, TRE was housed at Malvern College. TRE and RRDE merged in 1953 to form the Radar <b>Research</b> <b>Establishment</b> (RRE) to be further renamed Royal Radar Establishment (also RRE) in 1955. Further name changes took place according to shifts in operational focus until 2001 when the facility was partly transferred from public to private ownership and became QinetiQ. A small part was retained by the Ministry of Defence to become Dstl, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory. Malvern's Dstl contingent has since closed down with the remaining staff moving to other Dstl sites.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} a civil, not a military, one. Staff {{were drawn from}} and {{recruited}} into the Civil Service, and were paid Civil Service salaries. It was headed by Lord Portal, as Controller of Production, Atomic Energy, in the Ministry of Supply. An Atomic Energy <b>Research</b> <b>Establishment</b> was located at a former airfield, Harwell, in Berkshire, {{under the direction of}} John Cockcroft. The first nuclear reactor in the UK, a small research reactor known as GLEEP, went critical at Harwell on 15 August 1947. British staff at the Montreal Laboratory designed a larger reactor, known as BEPO, which went critical on 5 July 1948. They provided experience and expertise that would later be employed on the larger, production reactors.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that Bronze Age people had settled {{in the area around}} 1000 BC, although it is not known whether these settlements were permanent or temporary. The town itself was founded in the 11th century when Benedictine monks established a priory {{at the foot of the}} highest peak of Malvern Hills. During the 19th century Malvern developed rapidly from a village to a sprawling conurbation owing to its popularity as a hydrotherapy spa based on its spring waters. Immediately following the decline of spa tourism towards the end of the 19th century, the town's focus shifted to education with the establishment of several private boarding schools in former hotels and large villas. A further major expansion was the result of the relocation of the Telecommunications <b>Research</b> <b>Establishment</b> (TRE) to Malvern in 1942. QinetiQ, TRE's successor company, remains the town's largest local employer.|$|E
