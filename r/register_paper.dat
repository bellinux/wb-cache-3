40|$|Background: Medical quality {{registers}} {{are useful}} {{sources of knowledge}} about diseases and the health services. However, there are challenges in obtaining valid and reliable data. This study aims to assess the reliability in a national medical quality register. Methods: We randomly selected 111 patients having had a stroke in 2012. An experienced stroke nurse completed the Norwegian Stroke <b>Register</b> <b>paper</b> forms for all 111 patients by review of the medical records. We then extracted all registered data on the same patients from the Norwegian Stroke Register and calculated Cohen’s kappa and Gwet’s AC 1 with 95 % confidence intervals for 51 nominal variables and Cohen’s quadratic weighted kappa and Gwet’s AC 2 for three ordinal variables. For two time variables, we calculated the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient. Results: Substantial to excellent reliability (kappa > 0. 60 /AC 1 > 0. 80) was observed for most variables related to past medical history, functional status, stroke subtype and discharge destination. Although excellent reliability was observed for time of stroke onset (ICC 0. 93), this variable was hampered with {{a substantial amount of}} missing values. Some variables related to treatment and examinations in hospital displayed low levels of agreement. This applies to heart rate monitoring (kappa 0. 17 /AC 1 0. 46), swallowing test performed (kappa 0. 19 /AC 1 0. 27) and mobilized out of bed within 24 h after admission (kappa 0. 04 /AC 1 − 0. 11). Conclusion: A majority of the variables in The Norwegian Stroke Register have substantial to excellent reliability. The problem areas seem to be the lack of completeness in the time variable indicating stroke onset and poor reliability in some variables concerning examinations and treatment received in hospita...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{complexities}} of human aggression are of vital research interest in numerous scientific disciplines. In medical research, aggression is generally studied {{by means of}} self- or observer-rated inventories, clinical observations, or neurobiological research. Objectives. To test the hypothesis that replicable, gender-specific patterns might be involved in relationships between aggression, psychiatric conditions, and neurobiology. In particular, the study was designed to:· develop and standardize a self-rating aggression instrument for clinical and research purposes in a Swedish population,· study self-rated aggression and its components in a selection of psychiatric and medical disorders (persistent depressive disorder, PDD, first-episode depression, FED, and fibromyalgia syndrome, FMS) in relation to: 1) each other, 2) their neurobiological features, and 3) gender, · compare self-rated aggression in the patient groups with self-rated aggression in the general Swedish population. Methods. A self-rating instrument, the Aggression Questionnaire - Revised Swedish Version (AQ-RSV) was standardized {{on the basis of}} data from 781 individuals, randomly selected from the Swedish population <b>register</b> (<b>Paper</b> I). In the study described in Paper II, we used all demographic and aggression data from 497 recipients, whereas data from the 267 female responders alone were used in the studies described in Papers III and IV. In Papers II and III, we studied the aggression factors Total, Physical, and Verbal Aggression, Anger, and Hostility in relation to neurobiological aggression markers (the monoamine metabolites 5 -hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA) and 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxyphenyl glycol (MHPG), serum testosterone, and platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity). Results and Conclusions. In brief, the main findings of the project were: 1. In the general population, self-rated aggression usually decreases with age. The one exception is Anger, which in 20 -year-olds is lower in men than in women. In 40 -year-olds, however, male and female Anger had reached similar levels. 2. 	The AQ-RSV scores were higher in each patient group studied than in the general Swedish population. 3. 	In the general population, men are usually more aggressive than women as assessed by AQ-RSV, but the ratio between male and female self-rated aggression was inverted among patients with PDD. 4. 	In women with FMS, increased serum testosterone in combination with low platelet MAO activity predicted increased AQ-RSV scores. 5. 	Positive relations between 5 -HIAA, MHPG, and AQ-RSV revealed significant relationships between self-rated aggression monoaminergic turnover. 6. 	Gender distinctly modified the linkage between aggressive symptoms and central monoaminergic turnover in PDD...|$|E

40|$|The general aims of {{this thesis}} were to {{evaluate}} if a mass media campaign, aimed {{as a health}} promoting campaign, and visits to a specialist clinic in periodontology could increase the knowledge of periodontitis, symptoms and treatment. A further aim was to analyse expectations and satisfaction with care among patients referred for comprehensive treatment to specialist clinics. Paper I and II evaluating if a nationwide mass media campaign increased the knowledge of periodontitis (paper I) and factors associated with knowledge (paper II). The evaluations were done using a mail questionnaire in a before and after design. The questionnaires were sent out to 50 - 75 years old people in Sweden, randomly sampled from the population <b>register.</b> <b>Paper</b> I showed an improvement of correct answers about symptoms and treatment of periodontitis after the media campaign. In paper II, it was shown that education, utilization and perceived importance of oral health were related to knowledge {{both before and after}} the mass media campaign. Age and information about periodontitis from dental clinics were associated with knowledge before the mass media campaign. Paper III and IV evaluated the knowledge of periodontitis, and analysed self-perceived oral health (paper III), expectations on and satisfaction with care (paper IV), and evaluations were also done using a questionnaire in a before and after design. Patients referred to specialist clinics in periodontology for comprehensive periodontal treatment were consecutively sampled for the study. The results in 9 paper III showed an improvement in correct answers to the knowledge questions after visiting the specialist clinic. The most common self-perceived troubles were bleeding gums and sensitive teeth. Many of the patients experienced their oral health as rather good. In paper IV, the patients expected it to be very important or important to achieve healthy teeth and improved well-being after treatment. In general, many of the patients were satisfied with their dental visits. The patients also appeared be satisfied with the relationship to and the perception of the caregiver. In conclusion, there was an improvement of knowledge about periodontitis, possibly due to the media campaign and also after visiting a specialist clinic in periodontology. Even if the patients reported troubles from their mouths, they rated their self-perceived oral health as rather good. Achieving healthy teeth and improved wellbeing were important issues for the patients. Having a good relationship with and confidence in the caregiver seems to indicate satisfied patients...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the studies}} {{described}} in this thesis was to explore factors affecting attendance at outreach mammography screening, and to assess possible associations between socioeconomic factors and breast cancer survival. The relation of non-attendance at mammography screening to sociodemographic factors, indicators of general health behavior, self-rated health, experience of cancer in others, and own cancer or breast problems was studied in a case-control study with 434 non-attenders and 515 attenders identified in a population-based mammography register in the county of Uppsala (Paper I). Exposure information was obtained through telephone interviews. Being single and being non- employed were the only important sociodemographic predictors of nonattendance. Non-attendance was more likely among women who smoked regularly, had not visited a doctor in 5 years, had never had cervical smear tests, had never used oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, never drank alcohol, and who reported no breast cancer in the family or among friends or history of own breast problems. In the same case-control {{study the effects of}} attitudes, beliefs and knowledge were evaluated (Paper 11). Multivariate analysis showed that non-attendance was almost five times higher among women with the highest scores of perceived emotional barriers compared to women with the lowest scores. Both absence of worry about breast cancer and low scores of perceived benefits were associated with non-attendance. Other factors associated with nonattendance were less knowledge about mammography and breast cancer, lack of advice from a health professional to participate, and very poor trust in health care. To obtain descriptive insights into women's rationales for attending or not attending mammography screening, eight focus group discussions were conducted (Paper Ill). Through inductive analysis, six main issues were identified: negative experiences, perceived risk factors, knowledge of one's own body, perceived problems with mammography, political, ideological and moral reasoning, and involuntary non-attendance. The association between sociodemographic factors and non-attendance at mammography screening was further investigated in a record-linkage study with data from the mammography register in Uppsala, the Census of 1990 and the Fertility <b>Register</b> (<b>Paper</b> IV). Multivariate analyses among 4, 198 non-attenders and 38, 972 attenders confirmed that non-attendance was more common among women living without a partner, and among those who were not employed. Non- attendance was also more frequent among both childless and high-parity women, among those renting an apartment (rather than owning their apartment or house), and among immigrants from non-Nordic countries. The association between socioeconomic factors and survival among 4, 645 women with a first diagnosis of breast cancer in 1993 was assessed in a register study (Paper V). Sociodemographic data were obtained from the Census of 1990 and the Fertility Register. Stage of disease at diagnosis was obtained from Regional Cancer Registers. Follow-up through 1998 in the Swedish Cause of Death Register revealed that 772 of the 4, 645 women had died of breast cancer. Five-year survival was 59 % higher among women of higher socioeconomic status, after adjustment for stage of disease and age...|$|E
40|$|Population based {{cervical}} cancer screening (CCS), performed by midwives, to detect cellularatypia before it develops into cancer, {{has been in}} force in Sweden since the 1970 s. Thepositive effects of the subsequent decline in morbidity and mortality due to cervix cancer arewell documented but does screening also have negative consequences?Aims: To investigate knowledge about, attitudes to and experience of CCS (i) among womenin general, (ii) among women with experience of two mildly atypical Pap smears, (iii) amongwomen diagnosed with {{cervical cancer}} and (iv) among midwives who manage CCS. Populations and methods: Paper I, II and IV; A questionnaire was constructed comprisingof structured and open questions. Paper I was mailed to 400 women, 23 59 years old,randomly selected using the National population <b>register.</b> <b>Paper</b> II; A questionnaire wasmailed to women (n = 329) who according to the Department of Clinical Pathology five yearsearlier had two consecutive atypical Pap smears interpreted as CIN 1. For Paper III an openendedinterview, inspired by Grounded Theory was performed with eleven women, who hadbeen diagnosed with cervical cancer two years earlier. Paper IV; A questionnaire was mailedto 201 midwives working in primary health care managing the programme. Results: Paper I: Sixty-two {{percent of the women}} could indicate the site of the cancer thescreening actually examined. Only a few women connected cellular atypias with sexuallytransmitted infections and were aware of the partly protective effect of a condom. Women sknowledge and experiences were age dependant. Paper II: Memories of initial worry andanxiety when women were told about the atypical smear were reported by 59 %. Most womendid not report any signs of anxiety five years later, but 8 % reported a persistent negativeinfluence on their sexual life. Paper III: Screening for better or worse was identified as thecore category around which the categories unawareness, trust, search for understanding and making the invisible, visible was integrated and on which the conceptual model wasbuilt. In all the above studies, most women felt well taken care of by health care professionalsand they wanted to participate. Personal communication with midwives and doctors wasreported as the most important source of information about CCS. Even the women treated forcancer had a positive attitude to CCS, but they were negatively influenced by theirunawareness. Most women looked upon further Pap smears with a sense of security and hadtrust in health care. Paper IV: Midwives lacked guidance when informing about CCS andcytological atypias but most of them did not report a lack of theoretical knowledge. Midwivessaw themselves as the main informant about CCS but nevertheless they perceived women tolack knowledge about it. Conclusions: Women had a positive attitude to screening and wanted to attend. As long asthey were confirmed as healthy they did not engage themselves in information. The midwiveshad difficulties with evidence based explanations concerning screening and cervicalcytological atypias. The information given did not seem to reach women. A more empoweringmeeting where both midwives and women are more deeply engaged may improve the qualityof communication. We propose the introduction of an initial, longer scheduled meeting,within the screening programme as a new approach to enhance knowledge and motivatio...|$|E

40|$|Iatrogenic {{post-operative}} nerve dysfunction is {{a significant}} problem {{in many areas of}} surgery and can be caused by collateral thermal injury from activation of energy based surgical devices (EBD). The aims of this thesis were to: create an animal model in order to compare mono- and bipolar electrosurgery (ES) and an ultrasonic dissection (UD) with regard to collateral thermal nerve injury, and with data of a national multicenter register to study the use of EBD and their potential effects on operation time and complication rates in thyroid surgery. urgical devices (EBD). Material and Methods: The biceps femoris muscle of 104 anesthetized rats was cut in a standard manner adjacent to the sciatic nerve using clinical relevant settings of mono- and bipolar ES and UD. The sciatic nerve was stimulated supramaximally and the electromyographic (EMG) potential recorded before and after each experiment. Nerve dysfunction was defined as > 10 % reduction of the evoked EMG potential. In Paper II and III temperature was measured before, during and after instrument activation. The sciatic nerves were coded and examined blinded with light (LM) and electron microscopy (EM). Advanced temperature measurements were conducted in Paper II and III. In Paper IV, the use of EBD was specifically registered in the Scandinavian Quality Register for Thyroid, Parathyroid and Adrenal Surgery (SQRTPA) during one year and 1297 patients were included. Operation time, recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury, post-operative hypoparathyroidism and the use of topical haemostatic agents were compared between bipolar ES, electric vessel sealing (EVS) and UD. Clamp and Tie technique (C-A-T) being without thermal risk constituted the control group. Results: In Paper I the EMG potential was significantly more frequent reduced in the monopolar and bipolar ES group compared to the UD group and LM showed significantly less nerve damage in the UD group. In Paper II exact temperature measurements was possible with thermoelectric micros sensors and the thermal dose was significantly less and with less variation for the UD compared to the bipolar ES. Similar to the Paper I the EMG potential was significantly more frequent reduced in the ES group. Moderate and severe morphological damage was significantly less common in the UD group compared to monopolar ES. We found no statistical correlation between the highest temperatures/doses and the degree of morphological damage or functional loss. In Paper III the temperature increase was significantly less and with shorter duration in the UD group, compared to bipolar ES. LM and EM demonstrated loss of density in the myelin sheet only in a small number of nerves in all groups after instrument activation 1 mm from the nerve. In Paper IV, operation time was significantly shorter in the UD group and significantly longer in the EVS and bipolar ES group, compared to C-A-T. Postoperative hypoparathyroidism with need for Calcium treatment at discharge and at 6 weeks was significantly higher with ES instruments compared to UD. The incidence of reported RLN injury was 2. 5 % at 6 weeks postoperatively without statistical differences between the groups. Topical haemostatic agents were more frequently used in the EBD groups compared to C-A-T. Conclusion: The experimental Papers (I-III) demonstrated a lower risk of adverse collateral thermal nerve injury with activation of the mechanical UD technique compared to ES techniques. In the nationwide multicenter <b>register</b> <b>Paper</b> (IV), the use of UD shortened end EVS increased operation time compared to the low cost C-A-T.

40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were to {{evaluate}} maternal and birth characteristics as {{risk factors for}} breast cancer and cardiovascular disease later in life, and to assess maternal serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factors in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia. Birth characteristics and risks of breast cancer were studied in a case-control study nested within the population-based Swedish Twin <b>Register</b> (<b>Paper</b> 1). Female same-sexed twin pairs discordant for breast cancer (i. e., only one twin of the pair has the disease) were identified by record linkage between the Swedish Twin Register and the Cancer Register. Birth characteristics of 96 discordant twin pairs and 86 individual (i. e., not related) twins were obtained from birth records. In comparisons between breast cancer cases and age-matched external twin controls {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer was found among twins with gestational age of more than 40 weeks, compared to twins with gestational age less than 33 weeks. In within-pair comparisons between breast cancer cases and co-twin controls mean birth weight and ponderal index were higher in cases compared to co-twin controls. The risk of breast cancer also increased with increasing birth weight. Our results suggest an effect of growth and/or hormonal factors in utero, reflected by birth characteristics, on risk of breast cancer later in life. To investigate birth characteristics as risk factors for acute myocardial infarction (Paper 11), a similar study design was used as in Paper 1. Same-sexed twin pairs discordant for acute myocardial infarction were identified by record linkage between the Swedish Twin Register, the Cause of Death Register, and the Hospital Discharge Register. In all, birth characteristics of 132 discordant twin pairs and 118 individual twins were obtained from birth records. In comparisons between cases and sex and age-matched external (i. e., not related) twin controls, cases had significantly lower birth weight, birth length, and head circumference than external twin controls. In within-pair comparisons, no significant differences in birth characteristics were found between cases and co-twin controls. These results suggest that genetic and/or early environmental factors could influence the association between birth characteristics and risk of acute myocardial infarction in adulthood. To assess the association between birth weight and angina pectoris, we conducted a study using self-reported data of 4594 same-sexed twins participating in a complete screening of the Twin Register, of whom 381 individuals reported angina pectoris (Paper 111). Low birth weight (< 2. 0 kg) was associated with increased risk of angina pectoris in the twin cohort, when data were adjusted for potential confounders the risk decreased and did not reach significance. Dizygotic (n= 55) and monozygotic (n= 37) twin pairs discordant for angina pectoris were analysed separately. Low birth weight was significantly associated with an adjusted increased risk of angina pectoris within dizygotic twin pairs, but not within monozygotic twin pairs. These results indicate that there are genetic factors associated with both fetal growth and risk of angina pectoris, yet the results of the within-pair comparisons are based on small numbers. History of preeclamptic pregnancy reduces {{the risk of breast cancer}} both in the mother and the female offspring, and it has been suggested that lower levels of insulin-like growth factors (IGF) and higher levels of insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP) play an important role. To evaluate the possible role of these factors in the aetiology of preeclampsia, we measured maternal serum concentrations of IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP- 3 in week 17 and 33 of gestation in 30 preeclamptic and 128 non-preeclamptic women (Paper IV). Results showed no significant differences in serum concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 neither in week 17 nor in week 33. Preeclamptic women had significantly higher serum levels of IGF-II in week 33, but there was no difference in week 17. We found no evidence for lower levels of IGF-I and IGF-II, or higher levels of IGFBP- 3 in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia before clinical signs of disease...|$|E
