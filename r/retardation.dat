40|$|Abstract: In {{the past}} several years, a {{multitude}} of genes {{has been linked to}} mental <b>retardations</b> in humans, in particular the most commonly occurring X-linked mental <b>retardations.</b> An emerging idea is that structural and functional abnormali-ties in spines and synapses are a common feature of mental <b>retardations.</b> Consistent with this concept, a number of genes that control synaptic function have been implicated in X-linked mental <b>retardations.</b> In this review we discuss aberrations in spine and synapse structure and function in X-linked human mental <b>retardations</b> and corresponding mouse models with mutations in genes that modulate synaptic structure and function. A thorough understanding of these synaptic structures and abnormalities would enhance our knowledge of the normal process of learning and understand how synaptic aberra-tions contribute to cognitive deficits such as those observed in mental <b>retardations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Forced {{oscillations}} of {{the earth}} by tide generating potential are investigated by assuming the earth as a visco-elastic body. First, the Kelvin-Voigt type visco-elastic model is adopted for the earth and equations of motion are deduced. By solving the equations numerically, phase <b>retardations</b> of earth tides are calculated where viscosity within the mantle {{is assumed to be}} uniform. As a result, it is noticed that the <b>retardations</b> become marked when the viscosity is over 1015 poises. Second, the <b>retardations</b> are calculated for real earth models where radial distribution of viscosity is converted from Q model by Anderson and Hart (1978). Obtained <b>retardations</b> are too small to be detected by actual observations. It is concluded that the effect of mantle viscosity to the phase <b>retardations</b> is negligibly small. Through the calculations, Love's numbers, diminishing factor, gravimetric factor, etc. are also calculated for several principal components of tide potential. The results are nearly equal to the values obtained from the solutions of static deformation {{of the earth}}. There is, however, slight frequency dependence of Love's numbers. Finally, relations between the visco-elastic model of the Kelvin-Voigt type and the Maxwell type are studied. From the results, it may be said that even if any kind of vibrating motion of the Kelvin-Voigt type earth is considered, the same vibration is possible for the Maxwell type earth only by taking new appropriate values of viscosity. For example, 2 × 1 O 10 poises of viscosity for the Kelvin-Voigt model corresponds to about 1022 poises for the Maxwell model in the frequencies of earth tides. ここでは,地殻,マントルを粘弾性体と考えた場合,地球潮汐の状態がどのようになるか,特にその場合の位相遅れがどのぐらいになるかを理論的に考察している. 地球潮汐の位相遅れは,高さ方向の変位に対するもの,水平方向の変位に対するもの,およびポテンシャルの変化に対するものの 3 種が定義できる...|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the case of}} quasi-monochromatic waves, a focused optical pulse in the few-cycle limit may exhibit two independent curved wavefronts, associated with phase and group <b>retardations,</b> respectively.

As limiting cases, we consider an ideal diffractive lens introducing only phase <b>retardations</b> and a perfect non-dispersive refractive lens (or a curved mirror) introducing equal phase and group <b>retardations.</b> We study the resulting diffraction effects on the pulse, finding both strong deformations of the pulse shape and shifts in the spectrum. We then show how important these effects can be in highly nonlinear optics, by studying their role in attosecond pulse generation. In particular, the focusing effects are found to affect substantially the generation of isolated attosecond pulses in gases from few-cycle fundamental optical fields.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the dynamics of water around a small globular protein. Dipolar second-rank relaxation time and diffusion properties of surface water were computed by extensive molecular dynamics simulations of lysozyme in water which lasted a total of 28 ns. Our results indicate that the rotational relaxation of water in the vicinity of lysozyme is 3 - 7 times slower than that in the bulk depending on how the hydration shell is defined in the calculation. We have also verified that the dynamics of water translational diffusion in the vicinity of lysozyme have <b>retardations</b> similar to rotational relaxation. This is a common assumption in nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (NMRD) studies to derive residence times. In contrast to bulk water dynamics, surface water is in a dispersive diffusion regime or subdiffusion. Very good agreement of dipolar second-rank relaxation time with NMRD estimates is obtained by using appropriate dimensions of the hydration shell. Although our computed second-rank dipolar <b>retardations</b> are independent of the water model, SPC/E describes more realistically the time scale of the water dynamics around lysozyme than does TIP 3 P...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{combination}} with viscous liquids, high pressure was effectively {{used to study}} dynamic solvent effects on the rate of geometrical isomerization about a carbon-nitrogen and a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond in the molecules at their electronic ground (S 0) state. All of the reactions were slow enough to guarantee {{the validity of the}} transition state theory (TST) at atmospheric pressure and the TST-expected pressure effects were observed. However, strong pressure-induced <b>retardations</b> replaced such effects at high pressures. These <b>retardations</b> were concluded as an indication of a shift of the reaction from the equilibrium TST-valid region to the nonequilibrium TST-invalid region. In other words, slow thermal ¯uctuations of the solvent molecules at high pressures made it possible to observe dynamic solvent effects on unimolecular S 0 -state reactions. Separation of the static pressure effects from the dynamic solvent effects were performed by extrapolations of the rate constant in the TST-valid region to the TST-invalid one. This operation allowed us to make a direct comparison of the observed rate constant with that expected from TST. The results strongly suggest a necessity to separate the chemical and the medium coordinates in the reaction systems studied...|$|R
