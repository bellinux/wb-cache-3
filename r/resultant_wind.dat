40|$|We present semi-analytical and {{numerical}} models, {{accounting for}} the impact of radiative cooling on the hydrodynamics of the matter reinserted as strong stellar winds and supernovae within the volume occupied by young, massive and compact superstellar clusters. First of all we corroborate the location of the threshold line in the mechanical energy input rate vs the cluster size plane, found by Silich et al. (2004). Such a line separates clusters able to drive a quasi-adiabatic or a strongly radiative wind from clusters in which catastrophic cooling occurs within the star cluster volume. Then we show that the latter, clusters above the threshold line, undergo a bimodal behavior in which the central densest zones cool rapidly and accumulate the injected matter to eventually feed further generations of star formation, while the outer zones are still able to drive a stationary wind. The results are presented into a series of universal dimensionless diagrams from which one can infer: the size of the two zones, the fraction of the deposited mass that goes into each of them and the luminosity of the <b>resultant</b> <b>winds,</b> for clusters of all sizes and energy input rates, regardless the assumed adiabatic terminal speed V_A.

40|$|Movement of {{sediment}} {{into and out}} of polar deposits is closely linked to the polar volatile budget and to changes in wind systems over the course of astronomically induced climate cycles. The present observations of the morphology of polar layered deposits, mantling sediments, dune fields, and variable surface features are the basis of inferences on the efficacy of polar sediment transport mechanisms. The time scales of formation of these features vary from days to perhaps 10 (exp 6) yr, and latitudinal banding of dune fields near the poles may have been formed on timescales of 10 (exp 7) yr. Orientations of intracrater dunes, dune crests, and wind streaks have been measured for latitudes - 45 to - 90 to compare features of likely different timescales of formation with models of wind flow from the south polar region. There is a complex variation with latitude of the indicated wind directions and of the efficacy of the <b>resultant</b> <b>winds</b> in orienting dune fields that suggests influence of frost cover on the ability of winds to move sediment in the spring and fall. Because of changes in the relative effectiveness of spring and fall winds expected with progression of the season of perihelion, the latitudinal variation in transport efficiency may mean that sediments at different latitudes dominantly respond to wind erosion and transport at different times during the perihelion cycle...|$|R

Secondly, while in some of the cases analyzed the interaction between the two flows only resulted in the fanning out of streamlines and a slight redistribution in the wind speed, in many cases backflows and a total reorganization of the wind field occurred. Backflows have a blocking effect on the horizontal flow. Some of the computed patterns were compared with upper level cloud vectors (from geostationary satellite photographs).

40|$|The Indian Ocean Dipole Mode (IODM) is {{examined}} {{by comparing the}} characteristics of oceanic and atmospheric circulations, heat budgets, and possible mechanisms of IODM between El Nino and non-El Nino years. ERA- 40 reanalysis data, Reynold SST, and ocean analysis from Modular Ocean Model with the assimilation of the temperature profile from World Ocean Dataset 1998 are used to form three-year composites of IODM during El Nino (72, 82, 97) and non-El Nino (61, 67, 94) years. In El Nino years, two off-equatorial, anti-cyclonic circulations develop as a Rossby-wave response to the increased pressure over the Indian Ocean. The <b>resultant</b> <b>winds</b> from easterlies to northeasterlies (from southerlies to southeasterlies) in the northwestern (southeastern) tropical Indian Ocean warms (cools) the mixed layer temperature by inducing an anomalous zonal (meridional and vertical) component in the ocean current that advects the basic-state mixed layer temperature. In non-El Nino years, a monsoon-like flow induces winds from westerlies to southwesterlies (from southerlies to southeasterlies) in the northwestern (southeastern) Indian Ocean. As a result, the cold advection by the anomalous eastward current (northward current) in the northwestern (southeastern) tropical Indian Ocean becomes dominant in non-El Nino years. In addition, the anomalous winds in these regions are the same sign as the climatological monthly mean winds. Hence the anomalous latent and sensible heat fluxes further contribute to the decrease of SST in the northwestern and the southeastern Indian Ocean. Consequently, the cooling of the eastern tropical Indian Ocean rather than the warming of western tropical Indian Ocean becomes the major feature of the IODM during non-El Nino years...|$|R

For example, Caracena pointed out the relationship between a dry adiabatic lapse rate and microbursts in 'The crash of Delta Flight 191 at Dallas-Fort Worth international airport'. These early investigations led to the idea that numeric modeling of microbursts with varying atmospheric parameters might define 'signatures' that could lead to determining the probability of microburst intensity. The idea was that, by using already available sensors (such as static air temperature, pressure altitude, and radar reflectivity) onboard an aircraft, a reliable prediction of microburst existence and intensity could be formed. Such data could be used to create an 'expert meteorologist' using either artificial intelligence or other techniques {{that could be used in}} either reactive or look-ahead systems to vary sensitivity thresholds and coordinate the inputs from different detecting systems. To this end, Honeywell contracted to have the microburst simulations run. The questions to be addressed were the following: using the sensor set available to the aircraft (e. g. temperature, radar reflectivity, etc.), can we calculate the probability that (1) a microburst could be formed? and (2) that the <b>resultant</b> <b>winds</b> would be of sufficient magnitude to threaten the aircraft? Over a two year period, a data set of 1800 microburst simulations was accumulated. Verification of the microburst simulation was obtained using the results of other independent researchers and actual comparison to microburst events in Orlando and Denver.

Aerodynamic forces and moment on vehicles and bridge decks {{play an important role in}} the vibration analysis of the coupled WVB system. High-speed vehicle motion has certain effects on the aerodynamic characteristics of a vehicle-bridge system under crosswinds, but it is not taken into account in most previous studies. In this study, a new testing system with a moving vehicle model was developed to directly measure the aerodynamic forces and moment on the vehicle and bridge deck when the vehicle model moved on the bridge deck under crosswinds in a large wind tunnel. The testing system, with a total length of 18. 0 m, consisted of three main parts: vehicle-bridge model system, motion system and signal measuring system. The wind speed, vehicle speed, test objects and relative position of the vehicle to the bridge deck could be easily altered for different test cases. The aerodynamic forces and moment on the moving vehicle and bridge deck were measured utilizing the new testing system. The effects of the vehicle speed, wind yaw angle, rail track position and vehicle type on the aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle and bridge deck were investigated. In addition, a data processing method was proposed according to the characteristics of the dynamic testing signals to determine the variations of aerodynamic forces and moment on the moving vehicle and bridge deck. Three-car and single-car models were employed as the moving rail vehicle model and road vehicle model, respectively. The results indicate that the drag and lift coefficients of the vehicle tend to increase with the increase of the vehicle speed and the decrease of the <b>resultant</b> <b>wind</b> yaw angle and that the vehicle speed has more significant effect on the aerodynamic coefficients of the single-car model than on those of the three-car model.

5|$|In the {{dissipation}} stage, the thunderstorm {{is dominated}} by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20–30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a downburst. The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth. The downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft.
