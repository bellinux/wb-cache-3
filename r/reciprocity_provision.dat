40|$|Retail {{reciprocity}} requirements {{have been}} included in the electricity restructuring legislation of at least four states. These requirements mandate generally that out-of-state utilities which operate in a state “closed” to retail competition cannot market power to retail consumers in the “open” state. Because state reciprocity requirements enacted without congressional authorization are probably unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause of the U. S. Constitution, Congress would have to include a <b>reciprocity</b> <b>provision</b> in federal electricity restructuring legislation if it wants to support the view that such a provision will increase competition. This report reviews the treatment of state reciprocity requirements by the U. S. Supreme Court and discusses Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause...|$|E
40|$|While some {{innovation}} scholars {{fear that}} the landscape of innovation is becoming more restricted due to an expansion of intellectual property rights, others show that innovation processes are becoming more open. The question which unites these disparate literatures is not whether intellectual property rights are more expanded or relaxed, but how do the conditions and rules that guide the access and use of an innovation affect others ’ ability to build upon it? If we take this question seriously, it suggests a new focus on the antecedents of cumulative innovation: disclosure, accessibility, and <b>reciprocity.</b> <b>Provision</b> of these conditions is affected by legal, technical, normative and organizational conditions. If knowledge accumulation is critical to economic growth, than we must evaluate how our institutions affect {{the degree to which}} innovators can work cumulatively. Thus, in designing effective foundations for cumulative innovation, the critical question is not whether to pursue a strategy that is more ‘open ’ or ‘closed’, but rather how private contracts, public laws, norms and organizational solutions can be combined to support cumulative innovation among diverse parties. This is an outcome which should be of concern to both policymakers and scholars alike...|$|E
40|$|The paper aims to {{identify}} the facilitating and deterring factors affecting {{the implementation of the}} ASEAN Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) in engineering, nursing, architecture, surveying, medical, dental practice, and accountancy. On the overall, the progress of MRA implementation in the Philippines has been slow. For all professions, the issue of enacting new rules and/or regulations has been difficult due to the constitutional and other restrictions. Clear procedures and guidelines should be formulated for the implementation of the <b>reciprocity</b> <b>provision.</b> For temporary special permits, the law needs to be revised to allow complete borderless practice. Interviews and survey results on the facilitating factors affecting MRA implementation include the following: making MRA implementation a vital component of the national government agenda, awareness programs, close coordination between professional bodies and government, and projects to facilitate improvements in the quality of practice and address sector issues. The important deterring factors affecting MRA implementation include absence of a comprehensive program to implement the MRAs; lack of comprehensive databases, research studies on best practices, and review of foreign reciprocity; and absence of a coordinating body. Both the Professional Regulatory Commission (PRC) and the Department of Labor and Employment are currently in the process of putting policy measures in place to facilitate MRA implementation in the country. To move the implementation of the MRAs forward, the paper highlights the need to continue efforts to improve the process and create clear criteria for the labor market test and the skill shortage list. The paper also suggests the formulation of clear rules and guidelines in implementing the foreign reciprocity provision; strengthening the capacity of PRC as the central body coordinating the different MRA activities; and crafting of a comprehensive and strategic framework on MRA implementation...|$|E
5|$|Congress {{was not as}} {{enthusiastic}} about a customs union as Blaine and Harrison were, but tariff <b>reciprocity</b> <b>provisions</b> were ultimately included in the McKinley Tariff that reduced duties on some inter-American trade. Otherwise, the conference achieved none of Blaine’s goals in the short-term, but did lead to further communication and what would eventually become the Organization of American States.|$|R
50|$|Harrison took {{an active}} role in the tariff debate, hosting dinners parties in which he would cajole members of Congress for their support of the passage of a new tariff bill. Representative William McKinley and Senator Nelson W. Aldrich {{introduced}} the McKinley Tariff, which sought to raise the tariff and make some rates intentionally prohibitive. At Secretary of State James Blaine's urging, Harrison attempted to make the tariff more acceptable to other countries by urging Congress to add <b>reciprocity</b> <b>provisions,</b> which would allow the President to reduce rates when other countries reduced their own tariffs on American exports. Harrison hoped that the <b>reciprocity</b> <b>provisions</b> would allow for the growth of U.S. exports. The tariff was removed from imported raw sugar, and sugar growers in the United States were given a two cent per pound subsidy on their production. Even with the reductions and reciprocity, the McKinley Tariff enacted the highest average rate in American history, and the spending associated with it contributed to the reputation of the Billion-Dollar Congress. The reciprocity features of the bill delegated an unusually high amount of power to the president for the time, as the president was granted the power to unilaterally modify tariff rates. The Harrison administration negotiated more than a dozen reciprocity agreements with European and Latin American nations in an attempt to expand U.S. trade.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Healthcare workers (HCWs) {{will play}} a key role in any {{response}} to pandemic influenza, and the UK healthcare system's ability to cope during an influenza pandemic will depend, to a large extent, on the number of HCWs who are able and willing to work through the crisis. UK emergency planning will be improved if planners have a better understanding of the reasons UK HCWs may have for their absenteeism, and what might motivate them to work during an influenza pandemic. This paper reports the results of a qualitative study that explored UK HCWs' views (n = 64) about working during an influenza pandemic, in order to identify factors that might influence their willingness and ability to work and to identify potential sources of any perceived duty on HCWs to work. Methods A qualitative study, using focus groups (n = 9) and interviews (n = 5). Results HCWs across a range of roles and grades tended to feel motivated by a sense of obligation to work through an influenza pandemic. A number of significant barriers that may prevent them from doing so were also identified. Perceived barriers to the ability to work included being ill oneself, transport difficulties, and childcare responsibilities. Perceived barriers to the willingness to work included: prioritising the wellbeing of family members; a lack of trust in, and goodwill towards, the NHS; a lack of information about the risks and what is expected of them during the crisis; fear of litigation; and the feeling that employers do not take the needs of staff seriously. Barriers to ability and barriers to willingness, however, are difficult to separate out. Conclusion Although our participants tended to feel a general obligation to work during an influenza pandemic, there are barriers to working, which, if generalisable, may significantly reduce the NHS workforce during a pandemic. The barriers identified are both barriers to willingness and to ability. This suggests that pandemic planning needs to take into account the possibility that staff may be absent for reasons beyond those currently anticipated in UK planning documents. In particular, staff who are physically able to attend work may nonetheless be unwilling to do so. Although there are some barriers that cannot be mitigated by employers (such as illness, transport infrastructure etc.), there are a number of remedial steps that can be taken to lesson the impact of others (providing accommodation, building <b>reciprocity,</b> <b>provision</b> of information and guidance etc). We suggest that barriers to working lie along an ability/willingness continuum, and that absenteeism may be reduced by taking steps to prevent barriers to willingness becoming perceived barriers to ability. </p...|$|E
40|$|Little {{research}} {{examines the}} reasons adult siblings might provide social support to unmarried, dependent brothers and sisters. This article examines how obligation, reciprocity, {{and the quality}} of personal relationships affect whether siblings provide social support to the seriously mentally ill. It uses a sample of 108 siblings of 85 participants in a treatment program for the seriously mentally ill to examine the factors that predict several aspects of help <b>provision.</b> <b>Reciprocity</b> is an important predictor of reported and projected support: The more help respondent siblings receive from ill siblings, the more willingness to help they show in return. The availability of parental and other sibling caregivers is also associated with reported help from siblings. Neither norms of family obligation nor relational quality are highly correlated with support. The results indicate that professionals should take into account the potential importance of siblings as providers of social support to the seriously mentally ill and encourage their clients to develop reciprocal interactions with their brothers and sisters...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} the {{determinants}} and consequences of impression management (IM) support in communications between CEOs and journalists, whereby CEOs of other firms provide positive statements about a focal CEO’s leadership and strategy and/or external attributions for low performance at the focal CEO’s firm. Drawing from social exchange theory, our theoretical perspective suggests how IM support may result from norms of reciprocity among corporate leaders. We consider the potential for direct and generalized <b>reciprocity</b> in the <b>provision</b> of IM support, including generalized reciprocity in which CEOs who received IM support previously pay the support forward to another third-party CEO, and a second form of generalized reciprocity in which CEOs reciprocate IM support to fellow CEOs whom they believe have given similar support to other CEOs in the past. We also draw from the social psychological literature on persuasion to suggest why IM support for another CEO may have a more positive influence on the tenor of journalists’ coverage about the firm’s leadership than impression management by the CEO {{about his or her}} own leadership and strategy. We test our hypotheses with data from large and mid-sized public U. S. companies from 1999 to 2007, including original survey data from a large sample of CEOs and journalists. The results supported our hypotheses, and additional findings suggested that the apparent effects of impression management by leaders and staff about their own firms following a negative earnings surprise may be partially attributable to the effects of IM support...|$|R
40|$|Reciprocity – {{doing for}} others {{if they have}} done for you – is a key way people {{mobilize}} resources to deal with daily life and seize opportunities. In principle, reciprocity (the Golden Rule) is a universal norm. In practice, it is variable. Personal networks rarely operate as solidarities and as such, people cannot count on {{all the members of}} their networks to provide help all the time. We use random-sample survey data from the second East York study to provide the first analysis of the likelihood that social support will be reciprocated with either a similar or a different kind support. We also investigate how the nature of individual, relational and network attributes affect the likelihood of reciprocity. Our evidence is clear: the principal cause of reciprocity is giving support. People are most likely to exchange the same kinds of social support with each other (tit-for-tit). In addition, tie characteristics, such as the tie strength and the freuqency of contact, are important for the initial giving of support. They set the exchange in motion, with the Golden Rule coming into play thereafter for the exchange of emotional support and minor services. By contrast, there is little evidence of <b>reciprocity</b> in the <b>provision</b> of major services because of the large expenditures of time and money they entail. To some extent, people also exchange different kinds of support (tit-for-tat) : People who provide minor services are more likely t...|$|R
