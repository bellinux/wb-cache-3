5|$|In 1964, Bell Labs {{formulated}} {{their own}} set of requirements for radar work in relation to Nike-X. Working with the Army, Air Force, Lincoln Labs and ARPA, the Nike-X Reentry Measurements Program (RMP) ran {{a long series of}} reentry measurements with the Project PRESS radars, especially TRADEX. Additionally, a Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star aircraft was refit with optical and infrared telescopes for optical tracking tests. The first series of tests, RMP-A, focused on modern conical <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicles.</b> It concluded on 30 June 1966. These demonstrated that these vehicles were difficult to discriminate because of their low drag. RMP-B ran between 1967 and 1970, supported by 17 launches from Vandenberg, {{with a wide variety of}} vehicle shapes and penetration aids.|$|E

25|$|The Trident missile is a submarine-launched {{ballistic}} missile (SLBM) equipped with multiple independently targetable <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicles</b> (MIRV). Originally developed by Lockheed Missiles and Space Corporation, the missile is armed with thermonuclear warheads and is launched from nuclear-powered {{ballistic missile}} submarines (SSBNs). Trident missiles are carried by fourteen US Navy s, with US warheads, and four Royal Navy s, with British warheads. The missile {{is named after}} the mythological trident of Neptune.|$|E

25|$|Vehicles {{in orbit}} have {{large amounts of}} kinetic energy. This energy must be {{discarded}} if the vehicle is to land safely without vaporizing in the atmosphere. Typically this process requires special methods to protect against aerodynamic heating. The theory behind reentry was developed by Harry Julian Allen. Based on this theory, <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicles</b> present blunt shapes to the atmosphere for reentry. Blunt shapes mean that less than 1% of the kinetic energy ends up as heat that reaches the vehicle and the heat energy instead {{ends up in the}} atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|The U.K. had a {{stockpile}} of 215 thermonuclear warheads, of which 120 were operational, as of 2016, {{but the country}} has refused to declare the exact size of its arsenal. Since 1998, the Trident nuclear programme {{has been the only}} operational nuclear weapons system in British service. The delivery system consists of four Vanguard class submarines based at HMNB Clyde in Scotland. Each submarine is armed with up to sixteen Trident II missiles, each carrying warheads in up to eight Multiple independently targetable <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicles.</b> With at least one submarine always on patrol, the Vanguards perform a strategic deterrence role and are also believed to have a sub-strategic capability. Unlike the other permanent members of the Security Council, the U.K. operates only a submarine-based delivery system, having decommissioned its tactical WE.177 free-fall bombs in 1998.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Air Force {{currently}} operates 450 ICBMs, located {{primarily in}} the northern Rocky Mountain states and the Dakotas. These are all of the Minuteman III ICBM variants. Peacekeeper missiles were phased out of the Air Force inventory in 2005. All USAF Minuteman II missiles have been destroyed {{in accordance with the}} START treaty and their launch silos imploded and buried then sold to the public. To comply with the START II most U.S. multiple independently targetable <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicles,</b> or MIRVs, have been eliminated and replaced with single warhead missiles. However, since the abandonment of the START II treaty, the U.S. is said to be considering retaining 500 warheads on 450 missiles. The U.S. goal under the SORT treaty is to reduce from 1,600 warheads deployed on over 500 missiles in 2003 to 500 warheads on 450 missiles in 2012. The first Minuteman III were removed under this plan in 2007 while, at the same time, the warheads deployed on Minuteman IIIs began to be upgraded from smaller W62s to larger W87s from decommissioned Peacekeeper missiles.|$|E

25|$|Polaris was {{the largest}} project in the Royal Navy's peacetime history. Although in 1964 the new Labour {{government}} considered cancelling Polaris and turning the submarines into conventionally armed hunter-killers, it continued the program as Polaris gave Britain a global nuclear capacity—perhaps east of Suez—at a cost £150 million {{less than that of}} the V bomber force. By adopting many established, American, methodologies and components Polaris was finished on time and within budget. On 15 February 1968, , the lead ship of her class, became the first British vessel to fire a Polaris. All Royal Navy SSBNs have been based at Faslane, only a few miles from Holy Loch. Although one submarine of the four was always in a shipyard undergoing a refit, recent declassifications of archived files disclose that the Royal Navy deployed four boatloads of <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicles</b> and warheads, plus spare warheads for the Polaris A3T, retaining a limited ability to re-arm and put to sea the submarine that was in refit. When replaced by the Chevaline warhead, the sum total of deployed RVs and warheads was reduced to three boatloads.|$|E
500|$|The {{specifications}} for the ZBGM-75 {{called for a}} large solid-fuel-powered missile, which would be fitted with between 10 and 20 multiple independently targetable <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicles</b> (MIRVs). The missiles would be based in silo launchers, which were specified to be hardened {{by a factor of}} 10 over the existing silos used by Minuteman missiles. [...] In addition, there was also a plan to develop a railroad-based deployment system for the AICBM. Improvements in accuracy over existing missiles, combined with penetration aids under development to enhance the effectiveness of each missile, were expected to make the AICBM capable of defeating existing and projected Soviet anti-ballistic missile systems.|$|E

She was the fourth of the seven-boat Project 667BDRM Delfin class, which was developed at the Rubin Design Bureau in September 1975. A ballistic missile submarine, she was designed primarily to carry up to 16 R-29RM Shtil (NATO designation: SS-N-23 Skiff) SLBM for use against military and industrial facilities {{in the case of}} a nuclear war.

2500|$|The {{estimated}} 68 {{nuclear warheads}} of land-based nuclear weapons of India {{are under the}} control of and deployed by the Indian Army, using a variety of both vehicles and launching silos.

Additional variants of the Agni missile series are currently under-development, including the most recent, the Agni-IV and Agni-V, which are due to enter full operational service in the near future. Agni -IV has been inducted in the armed forces and Agni-V has successfully been tested and fired 4 times as of 2016. In addition to that Agni-IV has an estimated range of 4000km and Agni-V of 5500–6000km (estimated). Agni-VI is also under development, with an envisioned range of 8000–12000km and features such as Multiple independently targetable <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicles</b> (MIRVs) or Maneuverable <b>reentry</b> <b>vehicles</b> (MARVs).|$|E
