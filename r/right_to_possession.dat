Welles, in dissent, agreed that Blacksmith could individually sue for trespass, but disagreed that the appraisal was a condition precedent; he would have reversed and granted a new trial, with costs. The Court of Appeals remanded back to the Supreme Court, after which a writ of error was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|Conversion, being a {{wrongful}} act, cannot {{spring from}} the exercise of a legal right. Such acts include the right of execution on a legal judgment or contesting rights under a contract. The general rule {{is that there is}} no conversion until some act is done which is a denial or violation of the plaintiff's dominion over or rights in the property. To constitute a conversion of a chattel, there must be an unauthorized assumption of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>possession</b> or ownership. The act must have the essence of a tort.|$|E
2500|$|In Sykes v Walls , a {{claim of}} {{wrongful}} detention by a bailee was upheld as a good claim {{on the ground that}} a refusal to deliver up constituted a [...] "misfeasance". [...] By this case, trover became virtually concurrent with detinue. [...] When a chattel had been found, and there was a subsequent refusal to deliver it to the owner, it was taken as evidence that a conversion had occurred. Trover was a wrong against the right of possession and not against the possession itself, because possession was prima facie in the wrong-doer. Even when trover was allowed to overlap trespass and replevin, which were concerned with possession, it remained necessary to define conversion, and this extension did not really affect the definition. Conversion became any act {{on the part of the}} defendant inconsistent with the plaintiff's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>possession.</b> [...] This right had parts: [...] it had to be (1) absolute and (2) immediate.|$|E
40|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007 – 2008 resulted in numerous examples of state governments nationalizing banks or bailing out large private entities. Aside from the theoretical debate about nationalization and bailouts, there were practical {{questions about how}} to treat those who had invested in the nationalized banks.

However, instead of analyzing the case under the existing <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>possessions</b> doctrine, the Court deferred completely to the state. Furthermore, despite a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>possessions</b> doctrine that reflects the importance of individuals’ subsistence, the Court declined to distinguish the situation of the individual plaintiffs from the corporate plaintiffs. The European Court of Human Rights should recognize that individual plaintiffs are differently situated than corporate plaintiffs in terms of economic survival and should engage with the legal implications of those differences...|$|R

2500|$|An {{action for}} {{conversion}} may be maintained by persons having the immediate {{right of possession}} of the article converted. [...] In order for a plaintiff to recover in a suit for conversion, {{it is necessary that}} the plaintiff establish a right to the property and what is converted. [...] An immediate <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>possession</b> at the time of conversion is usually all that is required in the way of title or possession to enable the plaintiff to maintain an action. [...] The possession of personal property carries with it the presumption of title, and enables the possessor to maintain an action for conversion against any person except the rightful owner. [...] As against a stranger with no possession rights, mere possession alone is good enough, and in such a case, the plaintiff need prove no more than possession. Generally, a peaceable possession of land, even though wrongful, is a sufficient interest on which to base an action for conversion against a trespasser upon the land who severs property from the soil as part of the trespass, although neither party has title to the land or the property severed therefrom.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{distinction}} between trover and conversion. Trover resolved the old procedural problem of wager of law which had developed {{as a form of}} licensed perjury, which made detinue unattractive to an honest plaintiff suing a dishonest defendant. [...] Wager at law allowed testimony from many witnesses, who might {{have nothing to do with}} the actual litigation. In this sense, it was not much different from champerty and maintenance. Because trover sidestepped these old problems, there was an effort to expand it into many different forms. The legal device to accomplish this at first was to treat the allegation of losing the goods and then finding them as a fiction. This method was seen in several cases in the 17th century. [...] As a technical factor, the defendant was not permitted to deny losing and finding, so the only issues to be litigated were those of the plaintiff's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>possession</b> and the conversion as an existent fact. [...] With losing and finding no longer essential, trover became the standard remedy for any form of interference with a chattel. It entirely replaced detinue, which fell into complete disuse. It replaced trespass to chattels to such an extent that the former was rarely seen. In 1756, Lord Mansfield stated in Cooper v Chitty : ...|$|E
2500|$|Parliament passed England's first general statute {{limiting}} {{the right to}} recover possession of land in 1623. At common law, if entitlement to possession of land was in dispute (originally only in what were known as real actions), the person claiming a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>possession</b> {{was not allowed to}} allege that the land had come into his possession in the past (in older terminology that he had been [...] "put into seisin") at a time before the reign of Henry I. The law recognized a cutoff date going back into the past, before which date the law would not be interested. There was no requirement for a defendant to show any form of adverse possession. As time went on, the date was moved by statute—first to the reign of Henry II, and then to the reign of Richard I. No further changes were made of this kind. By the reign of Henry VIII the fact that there had been no changes to the cutoff date had become very inconvenient. [...] A new approach was taken whereby the person claiming possession had to show possession of the land for a continuous period, a certain number of years (60, 50 or 30 depending on the kind of claim made) before the date of the claim. Later statutes have shortened the limitation period in most common law jurisdictions.|$|E

5000|$|The Supreme Court reversed. Justice White noted [...] "Accepting {{the premise}} of the Court of Appeals that the case was {{essentially}} a possessory action, we are of the view that the complaint asserted a current <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>possession</b> conferred by federal law, wholly independent of state law." [...] The Court distinguished Taylor v. Anderson on these groundsHere, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>possession</b> itself is claimed to arise under federal law in the first instance. Allegedly, aboriginal title of an Indian tribe guaranteed by treaty and protected by statute has never been extinguished. In Taylor, the plaintiffs were individual Indians, not an Indian tribe; and the suit concerned lands allocated to individual Indians, not tribal rights to lands.... In the present case, however, the assertion of a federal controversy does not rest solely on the claim of a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>possession</b> derived from a federal grant of title whose scope will be governed by state law. Rather, it rests on the not insubstantial claim that federal law now protects, and has continuously protected {{from the time of the}} formation of the United States, possessory rights to tribal lands, wholly apart from the application of state law principles which normally and separately protect a valid right of possession.|$|E

50|$|In {{common law}} countries, {{possession}} {{is itself a}} property right. The owner of a property has the right of possession and may assign that right wholly or partially to another who may then also assign the <b>right</b> of <b>possession</b> <b>to</b> a third party. For example, an owner of residential property may assign the <b>right</b> of <b>possession</b> <b>to</b> a property manager under a property management contract who may then assign the <b>right</b> of <b>possession</b> <b>to</b> a tenant under a rental agreement. There is a rebuttable presumption that the possessor of property also has the right of <b>possession,</b> and evidence <b>to</b> the contrary may be offered to establish who has the legal <b>right</b> of <b>possession</b> <b>to</b> determine who should have actual possession, which may include evidence of ownership (without assignment {{of the right of}} possession) or evidence of a superior right of possession without ownership. Possession of a thing for long enough can become ownership by termination of the previous owner's right of possession and ownership rights.

The men argued {{that they should not}} be charged with stealing something which is unlawfully possessed. The court rejected this argument on the basis that larceny has always been an offence against possession. The common law has never recognised an absolute right of ownership. The owner is merely the person who has the best <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>possession.</b> Therefore, a person can be guilty of larceny by stealing from someone who had stolen the thing from someone else. The right to possess drugs is limited by statute but the occupant of the house had a better <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>possession</b> than the defendants.|$|E
