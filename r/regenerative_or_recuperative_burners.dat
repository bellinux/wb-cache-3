The development of fuel saving techniques {{that can be applied}} profitably to improve or replace conventional fuel fired furnaces is discussed. Existing furnaces can be improved by employing the principle of recuperation and through the use of lightweight refractory linings whilst a more radical approach to furnace design can offer many advantages.

In this industry, low level heat is of limited use so that heat recovery must operate either for air combustion preheating or for power generation with steam or organic Rankine cycles. <b>Recuperative</b> <b>burners</b> can be very effective in mould making furnaces. As far as electric induction furnaces are considered energy savings as high as 30  % can be produced with an easy heat recovery to heat office building and other factory departments. Some benefits can be gained also by a better insulation both of the furnaces and of the ladles.|$|R

The heat exchanger parameterization takes into consideration the main geometrical aspects of the exchanger under different operating conditions. The work originates from an industrial problem related to heat recovery issues in <b>recuperative</b> <b>burners,</b> in which air is pre-heated by the exhaust gas before entering the combustion chamber. Such a device allows for an in situ and more efficient heat recovery from exhaust gases, also reducing both the sizing of the heat recovery system downstream to the furnace, and the burner fuel consumption. It is found that the fine tuning {{of just a few}} geometrical parameters can result in a sensible enhancement of the exchanger efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a system of}} drying and heating the metallurgical ladles. The ladle heating parameters significantly affect the metallurgical processes. The heating process target of the ceramic ladle lining can reduce the steel temperature in the furnace. It resulted in reduction of energy consumption what is an economic benefit. Adopted drying and heating rate of the ladle depends on the ladle refractory lining - an alkaline or an aluminosilicate. The temperature field uniformity of ceramic lining is a basic technological requirement. The presented industrial research shows {{the way of the}} ladle heating where the self-recuperative burner was used. The <b>recuperative</b> <b>burner</b> application gives the rapid increasing of the preheated air temperature what has resulted in the reduction of fuel consumption for the same thermal power.

40|$|An {{optimization}} of {{the shape}} of a <b>recuperative</b> <b>burner</b> for industrial furnaces for tiles production is presented. The aim of the study is the maximization of the energy recovery from exhaust gas across a heat exchanger in order to pre-heat the combustion air. The study is carried out by means of CFD simulations. Eleven geometric parameters have been chosen and varied individually in an introductory sensitivity analysis. Useful information on the parameters influence have been thus obtained. Due to the large grid size and computing times, a direct optimization has been deemed unfeasible for our purpose. In its place, a fine tuning of the solution has been achieved by investigating the parameters interactions and finding a rather linear superposition of the effects. A reduction of the burner fuel consumption of almost 5 % has been attained without affecting the markers of the product firing quality, such as the temperature profile on the tiles floor along the kiln room...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} subsequent experimental testing of a porous ceramic wall which was employed to enhance radiative heat transfer in a gas fired, billet reheating furnace. The system was fired by a <b>recuperative</b> <b>burner</b> and the porous wall, which was constructed from zirconia panels, was located in the end wall of the furnace upstream of this burner. The passage of the flue gases results in the transfer of sensible heat energy to the porous ceramic and a substantial proportion of this recovered energy is reradiated back into the furnace chamber and hence to the load or charge. The size and positioning of the porous wall was carefully selected using mathematical models and small scale laboratory tests {{in order to ensure}} high levels of radiation enhancement, low resistance to flow and acceptable flow uniformity through the wall. Furnace tests demonstrated that the porous wall can provide effective heat recovery from the exhaust gases. This has resulted in significant enhancement in thermal radiation to the test billets and consequent energy savings of up to 22...|$|R

40|$|ARCO Metals Company (Formerly Anaconda Aluminum Company) is {{proceeding}} as scheduled {{with the construction}} of a $ 400 Million aluminum processing complex in Logan County, Kentucky. When the initial construction phase is completed in the Fall 1983, the complex will be capable of producing 400 million pounds per year of aluminum, sheet and foil using highly automated, computer controlled equipment that will maximize end product quality and minimize the consumption of energy. This paper will describe the basic processes used in the Logan complex and several design features that are being incorporated to reduce energy consumption. Large reverberatroy melting furnaces will remelt scrap aluminum and ingots will be cast on site to supplement those delivered to the site from ARCO Metal's reduction plants. The melting furnaces are expected to achieve a high efficiency which will be further enhanced by the utilization of exhaust gases to preheat the scrap as well as the combustion air. A coreless induction furnace will be used to reduce the melt loss normally associated with light gauge scrap. The ingots will be heated prior to rolling in the hot mill in direct fired preheating furnaces with variable speed fans that minimize cycle time. Flue gasses from these furnaces will be used to generate steam In a waste heat boiler. Motor loads in the hot mill and cold mills, along with other electrical loads, will be monitored by a computer system to minimize peak loading on the TVA power system. Annealing of aluminum coils will be accomplished in radiant tube furnaces with variable speed fan drives in an inert atmosphere produced by an electric powered air separation plant.

50|$|A {{single-ended}} <b>recuperative</b> (SER) <b>burner</b> {{is a type}} of {{gas burner}} used in high-temperature industrial kilns and furnaces. These burners are used where indirect heating is required, e.g. where the products of combustion are not allowed to combine with the atmosphere of the furnace. The typical design is a tubular (pipe) shape with convoluted pathways on the interior, closed on the end pointed into the furnace. A gas burner fires a flame down the center of these pathways, and the hot combustion gases are then forced to change direction and travel along the shell of the tube, heating it to incandescent temperatures and allowing efficient transfer of thermal energy to the furnace interior. Exhaust gas is collected back at the burner end where it is eventually discharged to the atmosphere. The hot exhaust can be used to pre-heat the incoming combustion air and fuel gas (recuperation) to boost efficiency.|$|R
30|$|As a consequence, a {{considerable}} amount of the total brake effort should be distributed to traction motors, by performing <b>regenerative</b> <b>or</b> dissipative braking, according to the capability of the overhead line for managing the corresponding recovered power. In particular, not only regenerative but also dissipative electric braking is quite attractive, considering the corresponding reduction of wear of friction braking components such as pads and disks. Since electric braking is applied in parallel with the conventional pneumatic one, an optimized mixing strategy in the usage of both systems, usually called blending, has to be performed.|$|R

40|$|Few {{attempts}} have been made to quantify the damage to agricultural crops resulting from known densities of a particular pest. Availability of such information, even in its most basic form, is essential to making cost-effective management decisions. The question seems straightforward and simple; however, it is neither. For example, the damage caused by rodents in an apple orchard is not easily observed or measured. Moreover, the ultimate economic effects are dependant to s. ome degree upon tree age, variety and replacement cost; weather, productivity market prices, and a host of other manageable and unmanageable factors facing the grower. In addition to these variables we must admit to not knowing exactly how the degree of girdling damage relates to health and vigor of the tree nor do we understand cumulative <b>or</b> <b>recuperative</b> factors which likely affect a perennial species. We do have evidence that compensatory growth can occur in certain damage situations (see for example Dyer 1973, 1975, 1976; Harris 1974; Hutchinson 1971; Pearson 1965; Vickery 1972; Westlake 1963 and Woronecki et al. 1976).

40|$|Sleep plays {{multiple}} functions {{among which}} energy conservation <b>or</b> <b>recuperative</b> processes. Besides, growing evidence indicate that sleep plays {{also a major}} role in memory consolidation, a process by which recently acquired and labile memory traces are progressively strengthened into more permanent and/or enhanced forms. Indeed, memories are not stored as they were initially encoded but rather undergo a gradual reorganization process, which is favoured by the neurochemical environment and the electrophysiological activity observed during sleep. Two putative, probably not exclusive, models (hippocampo-neocortical dialogue and synaptic homeostasis hypothesis) have been proposed to explain the beneficial effect of sleep on memory processes. It is worth noting that all data gathered until now emerged from studies conducted in young subjects. The investigation of the relationships between sleep and memory in older adults has sparked off little interest until recently. Though, aging is characterized by memory impairment, changes in sleep architecture, as well as brain and neurochemical alterations. All these elements suggest that sleep-dependent memory consolidation may be impaired or occurs differently in older adults. Here, we give an overview of the mechanisms governing sleep-dependent memory consolidation, and the crucial points of this complex process that may dysfunction and result in impaired memory consolidation in aging...|$|R

Heat Shock Proteins (HSP) are a large family of stress proteins involved in maintaining cell homeostasis. We studied the role of stress-inducible genes Heme Oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1), HSP 27, HSP 40, and HSP 70 in the kidney following a 4 hour period of brain death. Methods Brain death was induced in rats (n= 6) by inflating a balloon catheter in the epidural space. Kidneys were analysed for HSPs using RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Results RT-PCR data showed {{a significant increase in}} gene expression for HO- 1 and HSP 70 in kidneys of brain dead rats. Western blotting revealed a massive increase in HO- 1 protein in brain dead rat kidneys. Immunohistochemistry confirmed these findings, showing extensive HO- 1 protein expression in the renal cortical tubules of brain dead rats. HSP 70 protein was predominantly increased in renal distal tubules of brain dead rats treated for hypotension. Conclusion Renal stress caused by brain death induces expression of the cytoprotective genes HO- 1 and HSP 70, but not of HSP 27 and HSP 40. The upregulation of these cytoprotective genes indicate that renal damage occurs during brain death, and could be part of a protective <b>or</b> <b>recuperative</b> mechanism induced by brain death-associated stress. </p...|$|R
