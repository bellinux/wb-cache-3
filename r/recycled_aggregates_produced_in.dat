40|$|In many European {{countries}} recycled {{construction and}} demolition waste {{is used as}} a secondary raw material in the building industry because of environmental and economic reasons. Using recycled aggregates in concrete helps to reduce the pressure on landfilling sites for which the available space is getting scares. It also leads to a sustainable materials management in the building industry with a focus on achieving end-of-waste criteria and closing the loop. Potential use of recycled aggregate into constructions is related to the quality of recycled material. For this reason it is important to thoroughly test recycled aggregates. Appropriate tests are described in the European Standards EN 12620 for aggregates for concrete. [1] Latest version allows recycled aggregates for concrete to be tested the same way as natural aggregates. Properties of recycled aggregates which are convenient for use in concrete are introduced in an additional standard which is specific for each country. This paper includes a list of important tests on recycled aggregates. Further, the standards concerning the properties of recycled aggregates which are used in different countries are compared. In conclusion the most important tests are selected and the most important properties of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> <b>produced</b> <b>in</b> different European countries are compared. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Recycling of {{construction}} and demolition (C&D) waste and reuse of recycled {{materials in the}} construction sector provide a sustainable solution that saves land space, reduces the consumption of natural resources, decreases the transportation cost and protects the environment. Waste concrete amounts to a very large percent in the generated C&D waste in many countries. Waste concrete is a relatively good material and constitutes a valuable resource for various products. Instead of landfilling it, many European countries aim at recycling this material. In well developed recycling areas, the recycling rates are more than 90 %. Recycling of waste concrete into <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> is mostly performed.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} experimental program {{regarding the}} use of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> <b>produced</b> from demolition of brick buildings is presented. The brick wastes were crushed, sorted and classified into coarse and fine aggregates as well as powder (CBP). The first phase of the research focuses on the effect of incorporating <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> on physico-mechanical properties of paste, mortar and concrete. Non-traditional tests including X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and micro-structural analysis (MSA) were performed. The second phase of the program explores the effect of using <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> on properties of concrete masonry units. A total of 44 mixtures were utilized throughout the program. Results show cement paste when modified with 25 % CBP achieves smaller pore size and lower weight loss under high temperature than reference paste. Furthermore, the use of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> reduces the overall unit weight of concrete masonry units. Actually, modified concrete masonry units incorporating <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> achieve lower unit weight, higher thermal resistance and absorption rate than reference units. Although considerable strength reduction is noticeable by substitution, compressive strength levels meet the Egyptian specifications limitations. Critical replacement ratios are suggested to produce load bearing-concrete masonry units.

40|$|The {{properties}} of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> <b>produced</b> from mixed (masonry and concrete) construction and demolition (C&D) waste are highly variable, and this restricts {{the use of}} such aggregate in structural concrete production. The development of classification techniques capable of reducing this variability is instrumental for quality control purposes and the production of high quality C&D aggregate. This paper investigates how the classification of C&D mixed coarse aggregate according to porosity influences the mechanical performance of concrete. Concretes using a variety of C&D aggregate porosity classes and different water/cement ratios were produced and the mechanical properties measured. For concretes produced with constant volume fractions of water, cement, natural sand and coarse <b>aggregate</b> from <b>recycled</b> mixed C&D waste, the compressive strength and Young modulus are direct exponential functions of the aggregate porosity. Sink and float technique is a simple laboratory density separation tool that facilitates the separation of cement particles with lower porosity, a difficult task when done only by visual sorting.

According to local conditions, returned concrete may range from 1 to 5 per cent of the overall concrete production, representing a serious burden for the ready-mix plant. Recently, a new sustainable technology has been developed to convert returned concrete into aggregates. The aggregate product consists of size-graded material, for the most part formed by a core of coarse original aggregate with a shell consisting of a finer composite of sand and hydrated cement. The characteristics of the new aggregate depend on many factors, including the compressive strength class of the original concrete. In the present paper, the influence of the class strength of returned concrete on the performance of new concrete made with <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> <b>produced</b> with the new technology has been investigated.

40|$|Abstract. The use of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> to <b>produce</b> new {{concretes}} {{has become}} increasingly widespread, and numerous {{studies have demonstrated that}} the final product performs similarly to traditional concrete. However, construction and demolition waste (CDW) presents certain characteristics which could limit its acceptance in the construction sector due to worse performance than natural aggregates. One example of this is water absorption, which in <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> reaches such high values that the amount of free water calculated for mixing the concrete is affected, consequently impacting on the concrete's properties, especially consistency. This paper reports the possibility of solving this problem with a simple and inexpensive method; pre-saturation of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> prior to adding them to the mix. The results of two different pre-treatments are compared; one consisted of immersing the aggregates in water for 10 minutes and the other, in addition to the above procedure, included a brief period of air drying and subsequent elimination of surface water from the aggregate. Both pre-treatments were found {{to solve the problem of}} consistency...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of construction and demolition (C&D) waste and waste glass {{is a serious}} concern in Hong Kong, {{as well as other}} countries due to their non-combustible and non-putrescible nature, and the running out of disposal outlets. However, mineral wastes derived from C&D activities and waste glass are considered to have potential to be re-used as construction materials, especially as aggregates. In addition, Hong Kong urgently needs alternative and sustainable sources of aggregate, as the local quarry sites for aggregate production are expected to be exhausted soon. Many experimental studies have demonstrated that <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> from C&D waste and waste glass can be potentially recycled for various engineering applications in Hong Kong, but no study has yet attempted to assess the sustainability by lifecycle assessment (LCA) techniques. In order to increase the environmental awareness in the construction industry, assessment of the environmental performance of construction materials by LCA is therefore needed. The present study was conducted to assess and compare the environmental consequences of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> production from C&D waste and waste glass, and natural aggregate production from virgin materials by LCA by using case specific and first hand data. The results reveal that compared with natural coarse <b>aggregates,</b> <b>recycled</b> coarse <b>aggregates</b> <b>produced</b> from C&D waste reduce 65 % greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission with a saving of 58 % non-renewable energy consumption. Similar environmental benefits are observed for <b>producing</b> <b>recycled</b> fine <b>aggregates</b> from C&D waste. In addition, compared with the production of natural fine aggregates from river sand, <b>producing</b> <b>recycled</b> fine <b>aggregates</b> from waste glass saves 54 % energy consumption and reduces 61 % GHGs, and 46 % SO 2 eq emissions. According to the IMPACT 2002 + Method, significant health, resource, climate change and ecosystem damages can be saved <b>in</b> <b>producing</b> <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> from both waste materials compared to <b>producing</b> and importing <b>aggregates</b> from virgin sources. This is the first ever LCA study on <b>producing</b> <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> from waste glass. Therefore, it can be concluded that substantial net environmental benefits can be realized for <b>producing</b> <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> from C&D waste and waste glass. The results can provide a guidance to maximize C&D waste and waste glass recycling, resourceful treatment of wastes and conserve natural resources.

40|$|Australia generates {{approximately}} 43, 777, 000 tonnes {{of waste}} annually, in which 38 % {{are classified as}} construction and demolition (C&D) waste. <b>Recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> (RA), a construction material derived from C&D waste, has a comparatively higher water absorption rate, lower strength and modulus than natural aggregate (NA). These properties of RA have lead to their limited and low grade applications, mainly in road subbases and as fill materials. As the construction industry is actively seeking for more sustainable materials, the demands of utilising RA in high grade applications such as, as concrete aggregates are increasing. This paper summarises experimental results on workability, compressive strength, indirect tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> concrete (RAC) <b>produced</b> using air-dry <b>aggregates</b> with a constant water to cement ratio of 0. 45 and 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % replacement of NA by RA. The <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> samples {{used in this study}} are collected from a centralised recycling plant in Brisbane, Australia. Preliminary result shows that the effect of air-dry aggregate on concrete workability is within an acceptable range and can be rectified by adjusting mixing time.

40|$|Self Consolidating Concrete (SCC) is an {{emerging}} class of concrete materials that offers {{great potential for}} improved ease of positioning and scaled down cost through reduced time and labour. Generally, tonnes of Construction and Demolition Wastes (C&DW) are raised daily. The situation {{is similar to the}} paper industry where large amount of the wastes or paper sludge generated every day {{and at the same time}} bringing potential and devastating harmful impact to the surroundings. For this reason, the search into the use of coarse and fine <b>recycled</b> concrete <b>aggregate</b> <b>produced</b> from crushed concrete waste is looked into. Many researchers had found that waste materials have unique properties that could improve the quality of self consolidating concrete produced. Nevertheless, on that point there is no study available on using Waste Paper Sludge Ash (WPSA) as cement and coarse and fine <b>Recycled</b> Concrete <b>Aggregate</b> (RCA) as coarse and fine aggregate replacement materials respectively in self consolidating concrete. Therefore, the reuse of RCA and WPSA generated as the supplemental material for the replacement of aggregate and cement are significant in reducing the environmental impact. This research was focused on the strength characteristic and the chloride permeability level of SCC containing RCA and WPSA. The influence of RCA content in the range from 0...|$|R
