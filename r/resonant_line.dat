40|$|There is {{at present}} {{uncertainty}} {{as to whether}} radiation takes place from {{the length of a}} transmission line as well as the terminations, or from the terminations alone. An attempt has been made to determine the answer to this question, for the case of odd quarter wavelength resonant lines. A short historical survey of the different theoretical considerations, and the reasoning behind them, is given as a preamble to the present investigation. The <b>resonant</b> <b>line</b> method of Chipman was used to measure impedance of resonant lines for various resonant lengths and at various frequencies. From this data, the apparent terminating resistance (radiation resistance) is obtained.

40|$|A {{model is}} used to {{calculate}} energy absorption efficiency when a short-pulse laser impinges on a dielectric slab doped with an impurity for which the electrons have a <b>resonant</b> <b>line</b> at the laser wavelength. The amount of the energy resonant absorption is due to the overlapping between laser spectrum and resonance spectrum. The energy absorption efficiency can be maximized for a certain degree of doping concentration (at a given pulselength) and also for a certain pulselength (at a given doping concentration). For a modest amount of impurity, the resonant absorption may increase the fraction of energy absorption up to tens of percent of laser energy at 100 s optical cycles when the laser wavelength is tuned within 1 % of the <b>resonant</b> <b>line.</b> Dimensionless parameters are constructed so that the scaling to various parameters: laser wavelength, laser pulselength, dielectric constant, slab thickness, impurity concentration, resonant linewidth, and separation between the laser wavelength and the line resonance, could easily be obtained...|$|E

40|$|Remote sensing {{over long}} path lengths has become of greater {{interest}} in the terahertz frequency region. Applications such as pollution monitoring and detection of energetic chemicals are of particular interest. Although {{there has been much}} attention to atmospheric effects over narrow frequency windows, accurate measurements across a wide spectrum is lacking. The water vapor continuum absorption spectrum was investigated using Fourier Transform Spectroscopy. The continuum effect gives rise to an excess absorption that is unaccounted for in just a <b>resonant</b> <b>line</b> spectrum simulation. The transmission of broadband terahertz radiation from 0. 300 THz- 1. 5 THz through air with varying relative humidity levels was recorded for multiple path lengths. From these data, the absorption coefficient as a function of frequency was determined and compared with model calculations. The intensity and location of the strong absorption lines were in good agreement with spectral databases such as the 2008 HITRAN database and the JPL database. However, a noticeable continuum effect was observed particularly in the atmospheric transmission windows. A small discrepancy still remained even after accounting for continuum absorption using the best available data from the literature. This discrepancy, when projected over a one kilometer path length, typical of distances used in remote sensing, can cause a 30 dB difference between calculated and observed attenuation. From the experimental and <b>resonant</b> <b>line</b> simulation spectra the air-broadening continuum parameter was calculated and compared with values available in the literature...|$|E
