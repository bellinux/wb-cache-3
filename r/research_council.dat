50|$|NERC {{began in}} 1965 when several {{environmental}} (mainly geographic) research organisations (including Nature Conservancy {{which became the}} Nature Conservancy Council in 1973 and was divided up in 1991) were brought under the one umbrella organisation.

5|$|Since 1926, the University of Toronto {{has been}} a member of the Association of American Universities, a {{consortium}} of the leading North American research universities. The university manages by far the largest annual research budget of any university in Canada, with sponsored direct-cost expenditures of $878 million in 2010. The federal government was the largest source of funding, with grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering <b>Research</b> <b>Council</b> and the Social Sciences and Humanities <b>Research</b> <b>Council</b> amounting to about one-third of the research budget. About eight percent of research funding came from corporations, mostly in the healthcare industry.|$|E

5|$|A {{production}} {{contract for}} 3,000 units was immediately started at EMI, Pye, and EKCO. When they {{left for the}} USA in August, the Tizard Mission team took a Mk. IV, ASV Mk. II and IFF Mk. II with them, via the National <b>Research</b> <b>Council</b> (Canada). During the following discussions, {{it was agreed that}} the US would produce AI, while Canada would produce ASV. Western Electric arranged a production license for the Mk. IV in the US, where it was known as the SCR-540. Deliveries began for the P-70 (A-20 Havoc) and PV-1 aircraft in 1942.|$|E
5|$|An {{attempt was}} made to provide the {{completed}} Arrows to the National <b>Research</b> <b>Council</b> of Canada as high-speed test aircraft. The NRC refused, noting that without sufficient spare parts and maintenance, as well as qualified pilots, the NRC could make no use of them. A similar project initiated by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (Boscombe Down) had resulted in Avro vice-president (engineering) Jim Floyd's preparing a transatlantic ferry operation. This proposal, like others from the United States, was never realized.|$|E

5|$|Bainbridge {{enjoyed a}} series of prestigious fellowships after graduation. He was awarded a National <b>Research</b> <b>Council,</b> and then a Bartol Research Foundation fellowship. At the time the Franklin Institute's Bartol Research Foundation was located on the Swarthmore College campus in Pennsylvania, and was {{directed}} by W. F. G. Swann, an English physicist {{with an interest in}} nuclear physics. Bainbridge married Margaret ("Peg") Pitkin, a member of the Swarthmore teaching faculty, in September 1931. They had a son, Martin Keeler, and two daughters, Joan and Margaret Tomkins.|$|E

5|$|Cominco {{had been}} {{involved}} in heavy water research since 1934, and produced it at its smelting plant in Trail, British Columbia. On 26 February 1941, the Canadian National <b>Research</b> <b>Council</b> inquired about its ability to produce heavy water. This was followed on 23 July 1941 by letter from Taylor that offered a National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) contract to produce , for which the NDRC was prepared to pay $5 per pound for low-grade and $10 for high-grade heavy water. At the time it was selling for up to $1,130 a pound.|$|E

5|$|Economists {{incorporated}} the theoretical {{work from the}} synthesis into large-scale macroeconometric models that combined individual equations for factors such as consumption, investment, and money demand with empirically observed data. This line of research reached its height with the MIT-Penn-Social Science <b>Research</b> <b>Council</b> (MPS) model developed by Modigliani and his collaborators. MPS combined IS/LM with {{other aspects of the}} synthesis including the neoclassical growth model and the Phillips curve relation between inflation and output. Both large-scale models and the Phillips curve became targets for critics of the synthesis.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Compton {{was awarded}} {{one of the}} first two National <b>Research</b> <b>Council</b> Fellowships that allowed {{students}} to study abroad. He chose to go to Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he studied the scattering and absorption of gamma rays. Further research along these lines led to the discovery of the Compton effect. He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism, concluding that it was a result of the alignment of electron spins, and studied cosmic rays, discovering that they were made up principally of positively charged particles.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Compton {{was awarded}} {{one of the}} first two National <b>Research</b> <b>Council</b> Fellowships that allowed {{students}} to study abroad. He chose to go to Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory in England. Working with George Paget Thomson, the son of J. J. Thomson, Compton studied the scattering and absorption of gamma rays. He observed that the scattered rays were more easily absorbed than the original source. Compton was greatly impressed by the Cavendish scientists, especially Ernest Rutherford, Charles Galton Darwin and Arthur Eddington, and he ultimately named his second son after J. J. Thomson.|$|E
