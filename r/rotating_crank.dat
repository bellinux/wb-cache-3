50|$|In the mid-1700s {{the steam}} engine was of growing importance, and James Watt {{realized}} that efficiency could be increased by using different cylinders for expansion and condensation of the steam. This drove {{his search for}} a linkage that could transform rotation of a crank into a linear slide, and resulted in his discovery {{of what is called}} Watt's linkage. This led to the study of linkages that could generate straight lines, even if only approximately; and inspired the mathematician J. J. Sylvester, who lectured on the Peaucellier linkage, which generates an exact straight line from a <b>rotating</b> <b>crank.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{combat the}} L-39's immense recoil, the recoil spring is so stiff {{that it would}} be {{impossible}} to cock the weapon with a traditional charging handle. Instead, a <b>rotating</b> <b>crank</b> lever on the right side of the gun is used to pull the bolt back. While semi-automatic in function, the L-39's bolt locks back after every shot, and the grip safety also functions to release the bolt. The entire front of the grip and trigger is protected by a large guard and a rubber buffer to protect the operator's hands from the spent casings which eject from the bottom of the gun at very high speeds.|$|E

So the reciprocating motion created by a steadily <b>rotating</b> <b>crank</b> and connecting rod is approximately simple harmonic motion:where x is the distance {{of the end of the}} connecting rod from the crank axle, l is the length of the connecting rod, r is the length of the crank, and α is the angle of the crank measured from top dead center (TDC).

50|$|StreetStrider is {{the brand}} name for a mobile {{elliptical}} trainer. The StreetStrider consists of a T-shaped lower frame to which two front wheels and a rear wheel containing a drive assembly are attached, and an upright frame to which two reciprocating arm levers are attached. Two elongated foot platforms {{on either side of}} the lower frame are attached to cranks as part of the drive assembly, which, as with bicycle drivetrain systems, also includes a hub, a rotating axle, and an internal hub gear system translating the axle rotation to the hub. The StreetStrider drive assembly is either chained or chainless direct drive, depending on model. The lower end of each arm lever is attached to the front end of each foot platform, which, by connection in the rear to the <b>rotating</b> <b>crank</b> arm and in the front to the pivoting arm lever, moves generally in an elliptical path. The device also includes a leaning mechanism for steering, as well as brakes and multiple gearing. It was developed by David W. Kraus.|$|E
5000|$|Electric {{starting}} {{is available}} for small engines and is found primarily on high-feature garden machinery and larger generators particularly where {{there is already a}} complex electrical system and there may be a need for auto-starting on demand. However, a self-retracting rope-pull mechanism called a recoil starter is the predominant method of starting small engines; it does not require a battery to power a starter motor, nor an alternator to keep a battery charged. Before the invention of the recoil starter, a notched pulley was attached to the engine's flywheel; the operator would manually wind a rope around the pulley then jerk the rope to rotate the engine so that it would start. Another starting method briefly popular in the 1960s was the [...] "impulse" [...] or [...] "wind-up" [...] starter. These were operated by winding a heavy spring by means of a <b>rotating</b> <b>crank</b> handle equipped with a sprag clutch, then releasing the spring's tension by means of a lever or knob so that it would spin the engine. These were discontinued when safety problems became apparent: it was possible to leave the starter wound up and ready to start the engine unintentionally, even long after the crank was wound up, if the release were jarred.|$|E

40|$|The {{vibration}} {{behavior of}} the crankshaft in operation is complex to simulate {{because there are many}} contributing factors, some of which are varying, oil film stiffness and damping, coupled vibration of the <b>rotating</b> <b>crank</b> train and cylinder block. This paper describes a new method of analyzing the nonlinear vibration of <b>rotating</b> <b>crank</b> train, in which calculations are made of using nonlinear equation of motion. This method uses stiffness and mass matrices of the component parts, which have been extracted from the finite element model using in-house software. The coupled vibration of the rotating crankshaft and cylinder block is calculated by means of time history response analysis, in sonsideration of the non-linearity of the oil film stiffness, damping and friction. The accuracy of this calculation technique was demonstrated by comparing the calculated results with the actual vibration measured with LASER equipment...|$|E
40|$|A {{parameter}} tuning {{scheme for}} the neural oscillator is addressed to achieve biologically inspired robot control architectures {{based on a}} neural oscillator. It would be desirable to determine appropriately unknown parameters of the neural oscillator to accomplish a task of rhythmic movement under various changes of environment. Human or animal exhibits natural dynamics with efficient and performs robust motions against unexpected disturbances or environment changes. The neural oscillator needs to be tuned using its optimal parameters to generate such natural movement. As simple examples, this paper connects the neural oscillator to a pendulum system and a <b>rotating</b> <b>crank</b> system. To determine the optimal parameters of the neural oscillator for the examples, the optimization scheme based on the Simulated Annealing (SA) method is used.

50|$|Indexing is an {{operation}} of dividing a periphery of a cylindrical workpiece into {{equal number of}} divisions by the help of index crank and index plate.A manual indexing head includes a hand <b>crank.</b> <b>Rotating</b> the hand <b>crank</b> in turn <b>rotates</b> the spindle and therefore the workpiece.

50|$|The {{wind machine}} {{is played by}} <b>rotating</b> the <b>crank</b> handle, which is {{attached}} to the cylinder, to create friction between the wooden slats and the material covering that touches the cylinder but does not <b>rotate</b> as the <b>crank</b> handle is turned. This friction between the wood and the material covering creates the sound of rushing wind. The volume and pitch of the sound is controlled by {{the rate at which the}} crank is turned. The faster the handle is turned, the higher the resulting pitch and the louder the sound. The slower the handle is turned, the lower the pitch and the softer the volume. The sound of the wind machine can also be controlled by the tightness of the fabric covering the cylinder.|$|R

5000|$|An {{electropneumatic}} hammer {{is often}} called a [...] "rotary hammer," [...] because it has an electric motor, which <b>rotates</b> a <b>crank.</b> The hammer has two pistons—a drive piston and a free flight piston. The crank moves the drive piston {{back and forth in}} the same cylinder as the flight piston. The drive piston never touches the flight piston. Instead the drive piston compresses air in the cylinder, which then propels the flight piston against a striker, which contacts the drill bit.|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} human motor control strategies. Curved constraints offer {{a unique opportunity}} to exploit forces of contact. A circular crank experiment using the MIT MANUS robot was designed in order to test how well subjects can follow a set of simple instructions to <b>rotate</b> the <b>crank</b> at various constant speeds. 10 subjects volunteered to participate in this experiment. Velocity, force, and EMG data were collected during four tasks: turning the crank at the subject's preferred or comfortable speed, turning the crank at a constant preferred speed, turning the crank at a constant preferred speed with a visual feedback display, and <b>rotating</b> the <b>crank</b> at three instructed speeds (slow, medium, and fast) with visual feedback. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the velocity for each trial was computed as a measure of performance. Statistical analysis showed that speed significantly affected CV but the direction of turning the crank, clockwise or counterclockwise, did not. The observation that CV increased as speed decreased, despite visual feedback, confirms previous studies showing that human motor control is more imprecise at slower speeds. by Brian Wilcox.

50|$|Because the small-end {{position}} {{is lower than}} the half-way point of the stroke at 90 degrees and at 270 degrees after TDC, the piston moves less distance when the <b>crank</b> <b>rotates</b> from 90 degrees to 270 degrees after TDC than during the crank rotation from 90 degrees before TDC to 90 degrees after TDC.
