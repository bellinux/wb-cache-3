However, <b>Rep</b> traces {{the origins of the}} game to a card game of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) which used thirty-two wood or ivory pieces in the shape of cards. This evolved into the forty-card game of madiao (馬吊) during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), which had four suits of cards instead of the three found in modern mahjong.|$|E

40|$|Erythropoietin (Epo) is an {{indispensable}} erythropoietic hormone primarily produced from renal Epo-producing cells (<b>REPs).</b> Epo production in <b>REPs</b> is tightly regulated in a hypoxia-inducible manner to maintain tissue oxygen homeostasis. Insufficient Epo production by <b>REPs</b> causes renal anemia and anemia associated with chronic disorders. Recent studies have broadened {{our understanding of}} <b>REPs</b> from prototypic hypoxia-responsive cells to dynamic fibrogenic cells. In chronic kidney disease, <b>REPs</b> are {{the major source of}} scar-forming myofibroblasts and actively produce fibrogenic molecules, including inflammatory cytokines. Notably, myofibroblast-transformed <b>REPs</b> recover their original physiological properties after resolution of the disease insults, suggesting that renal anemia and fibrosis could be reversible to some extent. Therefore, understanding the plasticity of <b>REPs</b> will lead to the development of novel targeted therapeutics for both renal fibrosis and anemia. This review summarizes the regulatory mechanisms how hypoxia-inducible Epo gene expression is attained in health and disease conditions...|$|R

50|$|The basic {{principles}} of weight training are essentially identical to those of strength training, and involve a manipulation {{of the number of}} repetitions (<b>reps),</b> sets, tempo, exercise types, and weight moved to cause desired increases in strength, endurance, and size.

40|$|The {{title of}} my Bachelor’s Thesis is The Alteration of the Representation of the Minister for Education and Science Mailis <b>Reps</b> – the Case of Postimees daily. I {{examined}} three periods – 2002 – 2003, 2005 and 2006 – 2007. My {{purpose was to}} study how media represents {{a person who has}} an important institutional role in the society and how media looks in the case of <b>Reps</b> at the person, politician and institution. Main question was – how is the representation of <b>Reps</b> changed from 2002 to 2007 ? My hypotheses were following – <b>Reps</b> is represented in all periods negatively and controversially, the practice of giving labels is used very often, occupational incapacity of <b>Reps</b> is put on the foreground, an image of a young politician is constructed for <b>Reps.</b> To answer my research question, I conducted a quantitative content analysis and qualitative discourse analysis of texts. From the quantitative analysis I found out that: 1. The majority of texts had a negative orientation towards <b>Reps.</b> 2. The majority of texts handled Reps’s occupational failures and incapacities. 3. The conflict of Reps’s incapacity was the biggest in the third period. 4. The orientation of the text’s author was positive in the first period. 5. The majority of texts with negative orientation were published in the second period. 6. The interest towards <b>Reps</b> was the biggest in the second period. From the qualitative analysis I found out that: 1. The most important role in the case of <b>Reps</b> was the role of the institution. It was followed by the role of the person and the politician. 2. An image of a minister-trainee was formed for <b>Reps.</b> A stereotype is used that a young person is weak in the role of a minister because one has no life or administration experience. 3. The negativity of the journalists has disappeared in the third period but the criticism of the institution (Postimees) has increased. 4. <b>Reps</b> has been identified by gender and motherhood, and slightly by appearance. 5. The representation of photos is somewhat positive. 6. In the case of a few caricatures the note of criticism has been increased. Due to this the photo carries a bigger emotional meaning than the text does. 7. The representation of <b>Reps</b> is identified by high appraisal and by low neutrality and objectivity. 8. The practice of giving labels is usual in the case of representing <b>Reps.</b> 9. Reps’s comments are positive. She does not take criticism very seriously. Her use of language is a little naïve and rough around the edges. 10. The conflict of Reps’s failure has increased but the amount of texts which deal with the question of the educational problems has decreased. 11. Negativity towards <b>Reps</b> is increased by her visit to Mari, by her party background and by taking her two week old daughter with her to work. 12. The negativity in the headlines has decreased and the positivism increased. 13. The disappointment in <b>Reps</b> has increased and expectations of her decreased. 14. <b>Reps</b> is not identified through her field but through visit to Mari and through the child topic. On the results of my research I conclude that: 1. In {{spite of the fact that}} <b>Reps</b> as a person is represented positively, some of her personal qualities are not counted as acceptable in the role of the institution. These qualities are her age, mother language and confidence. 2. In the representation of <b>Reps</b> there has been used a constructive model in stead of a cognitive one. Same topics and arguments are being used. 3. There has been formed a myth that <b>Reps</b> has failed in her profession as a minister. 4. The topic of education has been personified. <b>Reps</b> is a sign which has hindered the discussion of educational matters. 5. A bilateral transmission has taken place – the criticism of the educational system in Estonia and the criticism of the Ministry of Education and Science has transferred to the minister and vice versa. 6. Also a bilateral disappointment has occurred – Postimees as the institution, journalists and other authors have been disappointed in <b>Reps</b> and <b>Reps</b> is frustrated by the media. 7. <b>Reps</b> is a sign of the time – she indicates the selectiveness, randomness and exclusion in the media...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the risk}} {{assessment}} of PCDDs, PCDFs, and dioxin-like (DL) PCBs, regulatory authorities {{support the use}} of the toxic equivalency factor (TEF) -scheme derived from a heterogeneous data set of the relative effect potency (<b>REPs)</b> estimates. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine <b>REPs</b> for dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) using expression of cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 1 A 1 and 1 B 1 mRNA in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells representing two different pathways. METHODS: We used a sex and age adjusted regression-based approach comparing the strength of association between each DLC and the cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 1 A 1 and 1 B 1 mRNA expression in 320 adults residing in an organochlorine-polluted area of eastern Slovakia. RESULTS: We calculated <b>REPs</b> based on CYP 1 A 1 expression for 4 PCDDs, 8 PCDFs, and 1 PCB congener, and based on CYP 1 B 1 expression for 5 PCDFs and 11 PCB congeners. <b>REPs</b> from CYP 1 A 1 correlated with <b>REPs</b> previously derived from thyroid volume (ρ= 0. 85; p< 0. 001) and serum FT 4 (ρ= 0. 77; p= 0. 009). The 13 log <b>REPs</b> from CYP 1 A 1 correlated with log WHO-TEFs (r= 0. 63; p= 0. 015) and 11 log PCB <b>REPs</b> with PCB consensus toxicity factors (CTFs) for compounds with WHO-TEFs (r= 0. 80; p= 0. 003). The complete set of derived 56 log <b>REPs</b> correlated with the log CTFs (r= 0. 77; p= 0. 001) and log WHO-TEFs (r= 0. 81; p< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: <b>REPs</b> calculated from thyroid and cytochrome P 450 endpoints realistically reflect human exposure scenarios because they are based on human chronic and low-dose exposures. While the CYP 1 A 1 seems more suitable for toxicity evaluation of PCDD/Fs, the CYP 1 B 1 is more apt for PCDFs and PCBs and reflects different pathways...|$|R
