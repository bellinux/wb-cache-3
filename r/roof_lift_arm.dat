40|$|A {{transportation}} robot's <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> have {{an effect}} on the comfort and safety of patients. Improved arms have been designed through dynamic and static analyses to increase safety if a sheet not present on the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms.</b> To design the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms,</b> experimentation is very helpful, however, it is difficult and dangerous to experiment on patients; therefore, a simple human model was made and used for the dynamic analysis. Through the dynamic analysis results, a safe width and comfortable location for the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> were determined. The thickness was then determined by static analysis and optimum design. In addition, tests have been conducted to confirm comfort and safety by deploying the designed <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> onto a transportation robot...|$|R

Here analysis of <b>Lift</b> <b>arm</b> is taken as a case study. I...|$|R

50|$|Problems often {{arise in}} {{incorporating}} a Walschaerts valve gear {{into the design}} of tank and narrow gauge locomotives because of space limitations. The reversing rod (with its <b>lifting</b> <b>arm),</b> needed to change between forward and reverse running, is therefore mounted {{at the same level}} as the pivot of the expansion link. This enables the lifting link (German: HÃ¤ngeeisen) to be dispensed with, and the <b>lifting</b> <b>arm</b> to be connected directly to the radius rod. To ensure the required horizontal movement, the back end of the radius rod is designed as a slide (the 'Kuhn slide') which fits into a rotatable crosshead (Gleitstein) in the <b>lifting</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{are five}} {{different}} hitch sizes, called categories. The higher category hitches have sturdier <b>lift</b> <b>arms</b> and larger connector pins.|$|R
50|$|A Schnabel {{car is a}} {{specialized}} type of railroad freight car. It is designed to carry heavy and oversized loads {{in such a way}} that the load makes up part of the car. The load is suspended between the two ends of the cars by lifting arms; the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> are connected to an assembly of span bolsters that distribute the weight of the load and the <b>lifting</b> <b>arm</b> over a large number of wheels.|$|R
50|$|The three-point hitch {{is made up}} {{of several}} {{components}} working together. These include the tractor's hydraulic system, attaching points, the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms,</b> and stabilizers.|$|R
5000|$|The word Schnabel is from German Tragschnabelwagen, meaning [...] "carrying-beak-wagon", {{because of}} the usually tapered shape of the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms,</b> {{resembling}} a bird's beak.|$|R
50|$|Mounted on a {{lightweight}} chassis with rail wheels, the operators cab and <b>lifting</b> <b>arm</b> pivot on a base, enabling 360 degree rotation. The {{end of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>arm</b> has a gripper for picking up sleepers, and a movable wrist to allow the tie to be positioned. Often a small trolley {{is connected to the}} tie crane by a drawbar, for either storage of new sleepers to be placed into the track, or for taking away old sleepers that have been removed.|$|R
50|$|Building {{openings}} such as garage {{doors and}} windows are often weak points susceptible to failure by wind pressure and blowing debris. Once failure occurs, wind pressure builds up inside the building resulting in the <b>roof</b> <b>lifting</b> off the building. Hurricane shutters can provide protection.|$|R

5000|$|Two further tilt bridges {{are known}} to exist in Belgium, both {{constructed}} in 2011. The Scheepsdalebrug (Scheepsdalebridge) in Brugge and the Sint-Annabrug over the river Dender in Aalst. The former combines the working mechanisms of a rolling lift bascule bridge and a tilt bridge: the bridge is mounted on two <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> which roll along racks, positioned parallel to the navigable way, tilting up the bridge leaf providing a clearance for passing ships. The latter is mounted on two <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> which are connected to fixed pivot points a few feet downstream from the bridge leaf.|$|R

5000|$|In German philosophy, {{the concept}} was used by Christian Wolff (philosopher) and Immanuel Kant to {{denounce}} illegitimate claims to empiricity of representations: I can perceive the formation of my will to <b>lift</b> my <b>arm,</b> and I can perceive the <b>lifting</b> of my <b>arm.</b> To say that I know empirically that my will <b>lifted</b> my <b>arm</b> would be a subreption in Wolff's sense.|$|R

5000|$|Coding was {{accomplished}} via mechanical <b>lift</b> <b>arms</b> and latching bails {{added to the}} typewriter's existing mechanical linkages in place for print-action. When a key was depressed, up to 8 affiliated <b>lift</b> <b>arms</b> were [...] "caught" [...] on latching bails which in turn connected 8 coding switches to the recording head. A commutator, powered by the internal drive motor, would momentarily complete the power circuit through the coding switches to the recording head before advancing the tape to the next recording position. When not encoding, a resistor balance network kept the recording head in an erase mode unless a rewind operation was commanded. This ensured a clearly defined magnetic space between bit patterns. Additional circuits prevented opening of the tape loading door once a tape was loaded.|$|R

The force of the explosion was so great that a two-ton concrete block was thrown clear off the building and crushed a 1936 Chevrolet parked 200 feet away. Approximately 500 students and 40 teachers were in the building at the time.|$|R
