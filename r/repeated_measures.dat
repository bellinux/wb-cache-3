40|$|Measures of airway {{inflammation}} {{are increasingly}} being used as outcome measures in asthma intervention studies. Meaningful interpretation of observed changes in bronchial mucosal cell numbers should depend, in part, on the reproducibility of <b>repeat</b> <b>measures</b> over time. We wanted to investigate the reproducibility of immunopathologic and physiologic parameters after short and long measurement intervals. We therefore performed spirometry, bronchial provocation challenge, and fiberoptic bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy (always right upper lobe second-generation bronchus) at baseline, after 2 wk, and again after 8 wk on nine subjects with stable atopic asthma (receiving inhaled placebo and �-agonist therapy only). Numbers of T cells, memory T cells (CD 45 Ro �), macrophages (CD 68 �), and eosinophils (EG 1 � and EG 2 �) on immunohistochemical stains of bronchial biopsies were quantified by computerized image analysis.

2500|$|Most frequently, peak {{standing}} biomass {{is assumed}} to measure NPP. In systems with persistent standing litter, live biomass is commonly reported. Measures of peak biomass are more reliable if the system is predominantly annuals.

These methods may underestimate ANPP in grasslands by as much as 2 (temperate) to 4 (tropical) fold. <b>Repeated</b> <b>measures</b> of standing live and dead biomass provide more accurate estimates of all grasslands, particularly those with large turnover, rapid decomposition, and interspecific variation in timing of peak biomass.

2500|$|A typical {{example of}} the <b>repeated</b> <b>measures</b> t-test would be where {{subjects}} are tested prior to a treatment, say for high blood pressure, and the same subjects are tested again after treatment with a blood-pressure lowering medication. By comparing the same patient's numbers before and after treatment, we are effectively using each patient as their own control. That way the correct rejection of the null hypothesis (here: of no difference made by the treatment) can become much more likely, with statistical power increasing simply because the random between-patient variation has now been eliminated. Note however that an increase of statistical power comes at a price: more tests are required, each subject having to be tested twice. Because half of the sample now depends on the other half, the paired version of Student's t-test has only [...] "n/2–1" [...] degrees of freedom (with n being {{the total number of}} observations). Pairs become individual test units, and the sample has to be doubled to achieve the same number of degrees of freedom.

50|$|Multilevel {{modeling}} with <b>repeated</b> <b>measures</b> {{employs the}} same statistical techniques as MLM with clustered data. In multilevel modeling for <b>repeated</b> <b>measures</b> data, the measurement occasions are nested within cases (e.g. individual or subject). Thus, level-1 units consist of the <b>repeated</b> <b>measures</b> for each subject, and the level-2 unit {{is the individual}} or subject. In addition to estimating overall parameter estimates, MLM allows regression equations {{at the level of}} the individual. Thus, as a growth curve modeling technique, it allows the estimation of inter-individual differences in intra-individual change over time by modeling the variances and covariances. In other words, it allows the testing of individual differences in patterns of responses over time (i.e. growth curves). This characteristic of multilevel modeling makes it preferable to other <b>repeated</b> <b>measures</b> statistical techniques such as repeated measures-analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) for certain research questions.|$|E

The current study aimed at evaluating the effect of cycloplegia on axial length and anterior chamber depth (ACD) measurements made with the IOLMaster and an ultrasonic biometer in children. Methods: Pre- and post-cycloplegic axial length and ACD were measured with the IOLMaster followed by the Sonomed A- 5500 in 31 children aged from seven to 15 years by the same examiner. The 95 % limits of agreement (LoA) were determined, if there were no significant correlations found between the mean differences and their means. Results: Seven subjects were excluded. Results from the remaining 24 subjects show that the effects of cycloplegia, instruments, and interaction between cycloplegia and instrument on axial length measurement were insignificant (<b>repeated</b> <b>measure</b> ANOVA F 1, 23 0. 15). The 95 % LoA in cycloplegia were better with the IOLMaster (- 0. 04 to 0. 04 mm) than with the Sonomed A- 5500 (- 0. 13 to 0. 14 mm). The 95 % LoA between the two instruments were similar with and without cycloplegia (pre-cycloplegia: - 0. 20 to 0. 27 mm; post-cycloplegia: - 0. 17 to 0. 22 mm). There was no significant interaction between cycloplegia and instrument in ACD measurement (<b>repeated</b> <b>measure</b> ANOVA F 1, 23 = 0. 85, p = 0. 37), however, ACD was 0. 05 to 0. 06 mm shorter before cycloplegia (<b>repeated</b> <b>measure</b> ANOVA F 1, 23 = 44. 70, p < 0. 001) and was 0. 06 to 0. 08 shorter measured with the IOLMaster (<b>repeated</b> <b>measure</b> ANOVA F 1, 23 = 28. 81, p < 0. 001). Conclusion: Effects of cycloplegia on axial length measurement in children made with IOLMaster and Sonomed A- 5500 were insignificant.
