While substitution mutations at the first (C 123 S) or third (C 140 S) cysteines were tolerated, females with a substitution at the second position (C 131 S) were sterile. Fractionation studies showed that sV 23 incorporates into a large disulfide linked network well after its secretion ceases, suggesting that post-depositional mechanisms are in place to restrict disulfide bond formation until late oogenesis, when the oocyte no longer experiences large volume increases. Affinity chromatography utilizing histidine tagged sV 23 alleles revealed small sV 23 disulfide linked complexes during the early stages of eggshell formation that included other VMPs, namely sV 17 and Vml.

Our work predicts that a direct observation of these mono-vacancies (MVs), showing a highly mobile and anisotropic motion, {{is possible only}} at low temperatures around 70 K or below where the thermal activity is greatly suppressed. At room temperature, the motion of a MV is sixteen orders faster than that in graphene, because of the low diffusion barrier of 0. 3 eV. Built-in strain associated with the vacancies extends far along the zigzag direction while attenuating rapidly along the armchair direction. We reveal new features of the motion of di-vacancies (DVs) in phosphorene via multiple dissociation-recombination processes of vacancies owing to a small energy cost of ~ 1. 05 eV for the splitting of a DV into two MVs. Furthermore, we find that uniaxial tensile strain along the zigzag direction can promote the motion of MVs, while the tensile strain along the armchair direction has the opposite effect. These itinerant features of vacancies, rooted in the unique puckering structure facilitating <b>bond</b> <b>reorganization,</b> enable phosphorene to be a bright new opportunity to broaden {{the knowledge of the}} evolution of vacancies, and a proper control of the exceedingly active and anisotropic movement of the vacancies should be critical for applications based on phosphorene.

40|$|Data on {{electron}} exchange reactions {{have provided}} insight into factors influencing rates of electron-transfer reactions in solution. The present paper has the twofold purpose of discussing {{some of these}} factors and of describing applications of these exchange data and theory to other phenomena. The reaction rate depends upon the extent of <b>reorganization</b> of <b>bond</b> lengths (angles) in the reactants and of solvent reorientation outside them. The reorganization is facilitated or hindered in a comparatively simple way by a favorable or unfavorable standard free energy of reaction. The rate depends, too, on coulombic and other interactions, as evidenced perhaps by certain salt effects, though probably only by a few orders of magnitude typically. The observed variation of rates of some 15 orders of magnitude is best attributed primarily 10 differences in the vibrational reorganization term, a factor calculable from bond lengths and force constants when known. A remaining factor, non-adiabaticity, is at present of uncertain importance. Arrhenius frequency factors in chemical and electrochemical exchange rate constants would provide the most direct information, but can be complicated or even dwarfed by solvent reordering effects in the coulombic interaction. Available data are few. They provide examples where a non-adiabatic effect is minor. There appear to be no known examples where it is major (Fe 2 + - Fe 3 + could be a candidate but its mechanism is apparently uncertain). Reorganization in reactants and in solvent occurs {{in a variety of}} related phenomena, and related concepts will be applied to treat them. In turn, chemical exchange data have useful applications to the latter. These areas include electrochemical exchange reactions, chemiluminescent electron-transfer reactions (between positive and negative aromatic ions, for example), and redox reactions of the solvated electron. An explanation for the chemiluminescent reactions will be based on the possible "inverse ΔF" effect, discussed several years ago by the author. A related phenomenon involving solvent "orientation strain" occurs in light absorption or emission by polar solutes in polar solvents, and the theoretical approach used by the author for treating it is closely related to that used for the exchange reactions...|$|R

Cellular redox is monitored by the N-terminal PAS domain of NifL which contains an FAD cofactor. Flavin-based PAS domains of this type have also {{been referred to as}} LOV domains. To explore the mechanism of signal recognition and transduction in NifL, we determined the crystal structure of the FAD-bound PAS domain of NifL from Azotobacter vinelandii to 1. 04 Å resolution.

This cavity is connected to solvent by multiple access channels which may facilitate the oxidation of the FAD by molecular oxygen and the release of hydrogen peroxide. The structure contains a dimer of the NifL PAS domain that is structurally very similar to those described in other crystal structures of PAS domains and identifies a conserved dimerization motif. An N-terminal amphipathic helix constitutes part of the dimerization interface, and similar N-terminal helices are identified in other PAS domain proteins. The structure suggests a model for redox-mediated signaling in which a conformational change is initiated by redox-dependent changes in protonation at the N 5 atom of FAD that lead to <b>reorganization</b> of hydrogen <b>bonds</b> within the flavin binding pocket.

By using a spiropyran-based (SP) mechanochromic copolymer, we present an optimized protocol for the microwave-assisted synthesis of a mechanochromic, alternating copolymer P(SP-alt-C- 10) via SPC that allows the reproduction of molecular weight distributions. Several parameters such as microwave power, temperature, stoichiometry, and ligand are screened, leading to molecular weights up to M-w similar to 174 kg mol(- 1). The process of optimization is guided by NMR end group analysis which shows that dehalogenation, oxidative deborylation and SP cleavage are the limiting factors that impede further increase of molar mass, while other classical side reactions such as protiodeborylation are not observed.

Structural snapshots of both redox forms {{have been obtained}} to reveal remarkably little overall structural <b>reorganization.</b> The Cu···Cu <b>bond</b> distance nonetheless undergoes an appreciable compression (0. 13 Å) upon oxidation, providing a Cu···Cu distance of 2. 4724 (4) Å in the mixed-valence state that is virtually identical to the Cu···Cu distance observed in the reduced form of the Cu_(A) site of thiolate-bridged cytochrome c oxidase. Despite the low structural reorganization evident between 2 and 3, the [SNS]^(-) ligand is quite flexible. For example, square-planar geometries can prevail for divalent copper ions supported by [SNS]^(-) as evident from the crystal structure of [SNS]CuCl (4). Physical characterization for the mixed valence complex 3 includes electrochemical, magnetic (SQUID), EPR, and optical data. The complex has also been examined by density functional methods. An {{attempt was made to}} measure the rate of electron self-exchange ks between the Cu^(1) Cu^(1) and the Cu^(1. 5) Cu^(1. 5) complexes 2 and 3 by NMR line-broadening analysis in dichloromethane solution. While the system is certainly in the fast-exchange regime, the exchange process is too fast to be accurately measured by this technique. The value for ks can be bracketed with a conservative lower boundary of ≥ 107 M^(- 1) s^(- 1), a value that appears to be larger than other low molecular weight copper model complexes for which similar data is available. The unusually large magnitude of ks likely reflects the minimal structural reorganization that accompanies Cu^(1) Cu^(1) ↔ Cu^(1. 5) Cu^(1. 5) interchange...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{study of the}} structural response of model water monolayers on a Pd(1 1 1) surface upon various electrochemical conditions. Whereas the water molecules pointing toward the vacuum are mostly electrochemically inactive, those lying parallel to the surface undergo an oxidative adsorption under oxidizing conditions, and those pointing toward the surface show a reductive adsorption under reducing conditions. The oxidative adsorption is shown to result from {{the interaction of the}} H 2 O 1 b 1 orbital with the metal surface dz 2 band which becomes bonding only under oxidative conditions. The reductive adsorption arises from the interaction of the H 2 O 4 a 1 - 2 b 2 orbitals with the dz 2 band of the Pd surface. This electronic analysis of electrochemical effects is further validated using the Fukui function associated with the water monolayers. The Fukui function is shown to be a powerful tool for studying electrochemical effects as it is directly linked with the electrochemical <b>bond</b> <b>reorganization</b> and other parameters like the surface capacitance. The electrochemical stability diagram for these water monolayers is computed using a new correction for the DFT electrochemical calculations and compared to previous results. The phase transformation from a positively charge H-up to a negatively charged Hdown phase is here confirmed with, however, a potential shifted up to 4. 5 V compared to our previous report (4. 3 V). The neutral phase is found to consist in a positively charged H-up phase and a negatively charged H-down phase. This phenomenon is confirmed by large super-cell calculations with different ratio of H-up and H-down phases. The stability of the mixed charged phases is then rationalized in terms of an electrochemical disproportionation whose origin and consequences are further discussed in regards to the results previously obtained {{on the basis of the}} ice rule...|$|R
40|$|Dilute {{solutions}} of -lactoglobulin (-Lg) A, B, and C were heated {{at temperatures}} between about 40 and 94 C for 10 min, cooled, and analyzed using Trp fluorescence and extrinsic fluorescence spectra of the probe 1, 8 -anilinonaphthalene sulfonate (ANS). Thiol availabilities using 5, 5 '-dithiobis(2 -nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) were determined using a separate set of samples. The normalized ANS fluorescence emission intensity and the thiol availability results showed a 1 : 1 {{relationship with the}} loss of nativelike but not SDS-monomeric protein, as determined by PAGE analysis. The normalized Trp emission intensity results did not show a comparable 1 : 1 relationship {{with the loss of}} nativelike protein, indicating that the Trp intensity arose from consequential disulfide <b>bond</b> <b>reorganization</b> and not the initial unfolding reaction. The results were also analyzed in terms of two-state models, and the midpoint temperatures (Tmid) for the proteins were generally -Lg C > -Lg A > -Lg B, and the slopes at the midpoint temperatures for the A variant were generally less than those for the B and C variants indicating that -Lg A may denature by a different mechanism from that of -Lg B or -Lg C. The Tmid parameters derived from the ANS fluorescence intensity results were similar to those for thiol availability and both were lower than the Tmid values for Trp emission intensity showing that creation of an ANS binding site on a -Lg molecule was linked to the irreversible exposure of a thiol group and the loss of native -Lg but preceded the decrease in Trp 61 fluorescence quenching. These results for the differences between the behavior of the A and B or the C variants involved the creation of a destabilizing cavity by the Val 118 Ala (A B) substitution and the changed charge distribution within the CD loop caused by the Asp 64 Gly (A B) substitution...|$|R
40|$|A {{synthesis}} of nicotyrine (9), and hence formally racemic nicotine, {{was carried out}} by elaboration of the 1 : 1 adduct 2 of cycloocta- 1, 5 -diene and chlorosulfonyl isocyanate (ClSO 2 NCO). Transformation of adduct 2 into carbamate 4 was followed by ozonolysis, tosylation, and NaH treatment, which led to pyrrolidinylpiper-idinone 6. LiAlH 4 Reduction, debenzylation, and aromatization yielded 2. Nicotine (1) is widely occurring in the plant kingdom and a most well-known member of alkaloids [1]. It is the addictive constituent of tobacco and, therefore, its effects are directly related to the socioeconomic issue of tobacco smoking, although scientific evidence has exonerated the carcinogenic role for nicotine 1). Historically significant is the fact that Pictet and Rotschy at the University of Geneva described the first {{synthesis of}} () -nicotine in 1904 via nornicotyrine, which arose from pyrolysis of 1 -(pyridin- 3 -yl) - 1 H-pyrrole [2]. This key step is now regarded as involving a [1, 5]-sigmatropic rearrangement that achieved the <b>bonding</b> <b>reorganization</b> (N-to-C shift of the pyridin- 3 -yl group followed by C-to-N move of an H-atom) [3]. Practically all the later syntheses started from pyridine derivatives in which a C-substituent is located at C(3) [4] (an exception is a biomimetic route [5]; for a preparation of nicotyrine from 3 -iodopyridine, see [5 b]). Our interest in a synthesis of nicotine stemmed from an analysis of bond connectivity in relation to hidden symmetry elements [6]. It was noted that an intermediate containing a 1, 8 -diaminooct- 4 -ene unit or somemodifications thereof (see Fig. 1) would be viable because simultaneous addition of a single C-chain and one of the N-atoms to the CC bond would provide all the skeletal atoms of nicotine. Regioselectivity in the addition is not an issue because of the inherent molecular symmetry that is exhibited by the oct- 4 -ene derivative (see Fig. 2). ± Vol. 87 (2004) 271...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{translocation}} of H+ along a {{chain of}} hydrogen-bonded water molecules, or proton wire, {{is thought to be}} an important mechanism for proton permeation through transmembrane channels. Computer simulations are used to study the properties of the proton wire formed by the single-file waters in the gramicidin A channel. The model includes the polypeptidic dimer, with 22 water molecules and one excess proton. The dissociation of the water molecules is taken into account by the "polarization model" of Stillinger and co-workers. The importance of quantum effects due to the light mass of the hydrogen nuclei is examined with the use of discretized Feynman path integral molecular dynamics simulations. Results show that the presence of an excess proton in the pore orients the single-file water molecules and affects the geometry of water-water hydrogen bonding interactions. Rather than a well-defined hydronium ion OH 3 + in the single-file region, the protonated species is characterized by a strong hydrogen bond resembling that of O 2 H 5 +. The quantum dispersion of protons has a small but significant effect on the equilibrium structure of the hydrogen-bonded water chain. During classical trajectories, proton transfer between consecutive water molecules is a very fast spontaneous process that takes place in the subpicosecond time scale. The translocation along extended regions of the chain takes place neither via a totally concerted mechanism in which the donor-acceptor pattern would flip over the entire chain in a single step, nor via a succession of incoherent hops between well-defined intermediates. Rather, proton transfer in the wire is a semicollective process that results from the subtle interplay of rapid hydrogen-bond length fluctuations along the water chain. These rapid structural fluctuations of the protonated single file of waters around an average position and the slow movements of the average position of the excess proton along the channel axis occur on two very different time scales. Ultimately, it is the slow <b>reorganization</b> of hydrogen <b>bonds</b> between single-file water molecules and channel backbone carbonyl groups that, by affecting the connectivity and the dynamics of the single-file water chain, also limits the translocation of the proton across the pore...|$|R
40|$|Water {{consists}} of an extended hydrogen bond network that is constantly evolving. More than just {{a description of the}} time averaged structure is necessary to understand any process that occurs in water. In this thesis we study the dynamic regime, which involves fluctuations and rearrangements that occur on the tens of femtoseconds to picosecond time scale. The dynamic regime involves hydrogen bond breaking and forming which interlaces with translations and reorientation and ultimately largescale reorganization. Our experimental technique is ultrafast infrared spectroscopy of the OX stretch (where X = H, D, or T) of isotopically dilute water. The OX stretch frequency is sensitive to its environment, and loss of frequency correlation provides a picture of local and collective hydrogen bond dynamics. With pump-probe experiments we are also able to measure vibrational relaxation and reorientational dynamics of water. We present the first infrared linear absorption spectrum of the OT stretch of isotopically dilute tritiated water and compare line shape parameters to the other water isotopologues to provide further evidence that electric field fluctuations properly describe line broadening of the infrared spectrum of water. Measurement of the infrared spectrum of tritiated water is the first step towards an experiment that may be capable of directly monitoring the relative geometry between two water molecules during a hydrogen bond switch. We calculate the change in electric field and transition dipole coupling during an idealized hydrogen switch to determine the correlated frequency shifts one might observe in such an experiment. To test the proposed vibrational relaxation pathway in isotopically dilute water, we present the first pump-probe of tritiated water and the temperature-dependent lifetime of deuterated water (or HOD in H 20). For the OT and OH stretch, our experimental findings agree with the proposed mechanism in which the vibrational energy first relaxes to the intramolecular bend. However, evidence from the temperature-dependent measurements of the OD stretch show multiple pathways may be in competition that have different dependencies on temperature. Our results call for further experimental and theoretical studies. We acquire temperature-dependent 2 D IR and pump-probe anisotropy measurements of the OD stretch of HOD in H 20 in order to test if spectral diffusion, which reports on hydrogen bond rearrangements, and reorientation are correlated in water. We compare the temperature dependence of the picosecond decay to a number of measures of structural relaxation and find similar activation barrier heights and slightly non-Arrhenius behavior, which suggests that the reaction coordinate for hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>reorganization</b> in water is collective. by Rebecca Anne Nicodemus.
