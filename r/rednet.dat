30|$|The {{described}} shared leadership {{dynamics in}} <b>RedNet</b> {{were related to}} network-level outcomes in terms of collective efficacy and perceived high network performance. <b>RedNet</b> participants repeatedly articulated positive judgments on achieved network outcomes and overall network effectiveness. With regard to intended and actually achieved results, our data showed that—in contrast to BlueNet—the results in <b>RedNet</b> are intended to be achieved for the entire network. That is, although <b>RedNet</b> naturally serves the improvement of member organizations’ performance, participants intended to advance with themes and projects through a common performance as a network. We saw that <b>RedNet</b> actors were full of confidence about being successful with their emerging new project and that they perceived their network activities as being very successful. They were convinced that collective efforts will result in joint achievement and advancement of “the theme”. Many <b>RedNet</b> actors referred to their network as being “extremely effective” {{as a means to}} achieve something together. Concrete outcomes became manifest, for example in the form of “petitions” that achieved improvements for subjects that were “really existential for us all”. Overall, they referred in particular to the influence that the network had on politics and the public (e.g. lobbying), and they reported outcomes such as evaluating joint strategies, or effectively submitting petitions or common statements, to direct public opinion or legal regulations.|$|E
3000|$|In contrast, <b>RedNet</b> members {{perceived}} themselves {{as part of}} a joint endeavor and displayed [...] "collectivistic network identity”, “joint network motivation”, and a “largely value-laden attitude towards network participation" [...] (see Table  3, Figs.  1, 2). A subtle clue that revealed the member organizations’ collectivistic identity was the tendency to refer to themselves as “we.” Because <b>RedNet</b> members developed a clear understanding about their common network purpose, they demonstrated a well-evaluated agreement on basic network positions in terms of self-commitment laid down in a “code of behavior, in which specific directions are stipulated, with regard to our subjects,” as one <b>RedNet</b> actor recalled. The participants’ agreement and shared understanding of overarching “subjects” was evident in their references to the subject in terms of an understanding of this theme that is taken for granted and of what the network stands for. In addition, they used the term “our subject,” indicating that <b>RedNet</b> members {{perceived themselves}} as a “large community”, bound together through their common concerns. <b>RedNet</b> actors metaphorically described their common ground and respective interdependencies: “We’re all in the same boat.” This “we feeling” accompanied the perception of increased solidarity. Concurrently, the network provided a platform “to bring our philosophy out externally much better through the network work,” as this <b>RedNet</b> actor stated. As we saw, the network became a means to transport values and express a specific identity for the members. On this basis, the members evaluated their network in terms of “how good we are as a collective.” Overall, they perceived <b>RedNet</b> as “a very good network” and that it is successful in transporting members’ values and philosophy (e.g. on environment management and sustainability).|$|E

40|$|Background: The rapid {{diffusion}} of Novel Psychoactive Substances (NPS) constitutes an important challenge {{in terms of}} public health and a novelty in clinical settings, where these compounds may lead to erratic symptoms, unascertained effects and multi-intoxication scenarios, especially in emergency situations. The number of NPS available on the illicit drug market is astonishing: official reports suggest the appearance of a new drug every week. NPS may be enlisted in many different families such as synthetic phenethylamines, tryptamines, cathinones, piperazines, ketamine-like compounds, cannabimimetics and other plant-derived, medical products and derivatives. Therefore, healthcare services and professionals are often called to face this unknown ???galaxy??? where NPS users seem to perceive traditional services ???unfitting??? for their needs, requiring an attention which is quite different from known classic drug abusers. In this context, the Recreational Drugs??? European Network (<b>ReDNet),</b> a research project funded the European Commission and led by the University of Hertfordshire, aimed to explore the NPS galaxy and develop information tools for vulnerable individuals and professionals working with them. This initiative reported specific Technical Folders on new drugs and disseminated the collected information through innovative communication technologies (e. g. multimedia tools, social networking and mobile phone services) internationally. Aim and objectives: The aim of this work is to evaluate and contribute to expand the knowledge of health professionals on NPS. The key objectives are: 1) to assess the level of knowledge on NPS amongst a sample of Italian healthcare professionals; 2) {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} dissemination tools developed by <b>ReDNet,</b> including an SMS-Email/mobile service (SMAIL); 3) to understand the clinical impact of NPS by providing four Technical Folders and collecting two clinical cases on NPS. Methodology: According to the objectives, the methodological approach has been articulated in the following three phases. Phase 1 : investigating knowledge and preferred channels of information via an online survey among health professionals in Italy. This first Italian study on NPS awareness had been online from February to July 2011, recruiting participants from Departments of Addiction, Psychiatry and other services. Phase 2 : evaluating the <b>ReDNet</b> initiative. An evaluation questionnaire was designed and disseminated online to assess the various resources provided by <b>ReDNet</b> project; it had been online from April to July 2013, targeting professionals registered to <b>ReDNet</b> services. This phase also investigated the SMAIL service, a mobile application that was the latest technological tool developed by <b>ReDNet</b> team. Phase 3 : promoting evidence based work in clinical practice through the preparation of four Technical Folders and two case reports. Technical Folders followed the methodology optimised during the <b>ReDNet</b> experience, organising NPS data under specific headings, measured for the need of health professionals. Case reports were collected in a Dual Diagnosis Unit in Italy (???Casa di Cura Parco dei Tigli???); assessed patients revealed for the first time the use of NPS; clinical interviews were conducted to collect a full anamnesis while for the first time psychopathological characteristics were measured in NPS abusers, using a psychometric instrument (MMPI- 2). Results: In Phase 1 Italian services, in particular interviewees (n= 243) from Departments of Psychiatry and Addiction, showed a strong interest for the subject but a poor understanding of NPS: 26. 7...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Drug abuse has {{increased}} markedly {{in the last}} decade especially with the emerging of the unregulated websites selling novel herbal, designer and pharmaceutical psychoactive products. These are advertised online as ???legal??? or ???pure??? and sold at very low prices. In this respect, the Recreational Drug European Network (<b>ReDNet)</b> aims to pilot various multimedia solutions focused on the prevention of drug abuse, which are based on technical and scientific information. The service is targeted at both professionals and young people. Methods: (a) monitoring the web for emerging novel drugs of abuse; (b) testing these products using the appropriate analytical techniques and (3) disseminating information via technological tools such as interactive websites, SMS alert, social networking (Facebook, Twitter), Multimedia (YouTube), Smartphone applications (iPhone), and seminars for professionals in the virtual learning environments (Second Life). Results: Up to date, 500 health professionals are using the interactive website on regular basis. The <b>ReDNet</b> Facebook page has 250 likes. Seminars for professionals on Second Life have started since January 2011. SMS alerts, phone applications and other innovative services will soon be available for health professionals and young people. Conclusions: The piloting of innovative ICT-based prevention programmes with respect to novel psychoactive drugs is an essential step to tackle their rapid diffusion and promote safer and knowledge-based online environments and healthier life styles...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The recent {{emergence}} of new psychoactive compounds (NPS) has raised prominent challenges {{in the fields of}} drug policy, substance use research, public health and service provision. The Recreational Drugs European Network (<b>ReDNet)</b> project, funded by the European Commission, was implemented to improve the information stream to young people and professionals about effects/risks of NPS identifying online products and disseminating relevant information through technological tools. Methods: Regular multilingual qualitative assessments of websites, drugs fora and other online resources were carried out using the Google search engine in 8 languages from collaborating countries. These included: the UK, Norway, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Italy and Spain. Products were tested and prevention messages were developed and disseminated via technological tools such as interactive websites, SMS alert, social networking (Facebook, Twitter), Multimedia (You Tube), Smartphone applications (iPhone), and virtual learning environments (Second Life). Results: The <b>ReDNet</b> project established itself as the first Europe-wide prevention programme designed for NPS based on the efficacy of novel ICT-based forms of intervention. More than 650 NPS products and combinations were identified; relevant information was disseminated to target population and advice was given to both EU/ international agencies and national policy makers. Conclusions: Web monitoring activities are essential for mapping the diffusion of NPS and the use of technological tools can be successfully incorporated in specific prevention programmes. Furthermore, the involvement of multi-disciplinary international partnerships was and continues to be fundamental for responding to such a prominent challenge...|$|E
3000|$|In contrast, <b>RedNet</b> coordinators’ {{activities}} facilitated joint-motivational {{network identity}} by {{the preparation of}} context and processes for identity enactment (cf. Fig.  1). This involves an inclusive, open-minded, and heedful moderation without “prefabricated opinions” to give “everyone an opportunity to keep up”, and “to meet people halfway as well” (<b>RedNet</b> actor).The coordinators summarized different knowledge and meanings, promoted collective sense making, and were engaged in sense giving in that, for example, they tried to show “cross-connections” of subjects, or provided input from an overarching perspective. However, such inputs were provided more as consultation than as compulsion, as this coordinator recalled: “Often a vote isn’t taken; there’s more of a formation of opinion.” The coordinators noted that they tried to include space for identity expression and forged the network as an identity enactment scene to support the emergence of collectively shared stories and ideals. In doing so, coordinators sensibly shifted between moderating open-ended, collective learning processes and forging consent or decision-making. Interestingly, however, decisions were usually not made through a democratic vote, as observed by this coordinator: “Voting by show of hands is very rare.” Rather, to capture emerging consent or still existing diverging individual opinions, the coordinator relies on the perceived mood or atmosphere: “It’s more of a feeling if we’ve addressed a topic, discussed it. There is an unspoken consensus, accordance, without things having to be voted on.” In the meetings, the coordinator looked around the group, made eye contact with those present, and attempted to capture the mood to extract a line {{that allowed him to}} continue his work. Overall, the coordinators’ practices were related to expert knowledge and relational skills, such as mindful listening and sensitivity to the mood within network settings. Given the crucial tasks of coordinators, it became apparent that networks were not “self-organizing”. As one coordinator reported, he often thought about a stronger form of “self-organization”, but also realized that such an approach would not work—an observation that he also reflected and confirmed in the feedback dialogue. Finally, a pleasant ambiance and an emotionally positive climate appeared to be relevant, as for example this interviewee observed: “Everything was combined {{with a certain amount of}} cheerfulness and ease.” Another participant saw the positive climate of cooperation as stemming partly from “this step into the world behind the material, that you include philosophical and moral topics as well,” and finally noted, “In the <b>RedNet,</b> we have a philosophical component as well.” [...]...|$|E
3000|$|Given {{the nascent}} status of theorizing on {{leadership}} in interorganizational collaborative networks {{and based on}} the reasoning provided above, our research centers around three relatively open questions with respect to the nature of leadership in collaborative interorganizational networks and the generative sources of leadership emergence. First, we ask, “How and in what form, if at all, will leadership emerge in the networks?” We took both single and plural forms of leadership (e.g. shared or collective leadership) into consideration without, however, expecting any specific form. We refer to the networks with the pseudonyms “BlueNet” and “RedNet”. We observed how, both in BlueNet and <b>RedNet,</b> no individual emerged as a single network leader. Beyond this overarching rejection of single leadership, however, we revealed two distinct leadership-related phenomena. The <b>RedNet</b> actors developed collectively shared leadership processes, whereas the BlueNet actors remained at the stage of leaderless network cooperation (i.e. no single participant emerged as a leader, nor did the collective become engaged in leadership processes). We attempted to understand how and why these (non)leadership phenomena occurred in such different ways in networks that in other respects were rather similar. Therefore, our second question was “What might contribute to explain these different (non-)leadership phenomena?” Finally, we wanted to discover how far these dynamics could be forged by network coordinators or persons in similar more formal roles, so that our third question was “What are significant differentiation features in the network coordinators’ main activities that might contribute to facilitating emerging different (non)leadership phenomena?” [...]...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Novel psychoactive {{substances}} (NPS; a. k. a. ???legal highs??? or ???smart drugs???) are advertised online as ???safe??? and ???legal??? natural/synthetic analogues {{of controlled}} illicit drugs. However, only {{little research has}} been carried out in identifying the health professionals' knowledge and expertise relating to the intake of these compounds. Methods: Data presented here refer to the Italian component of the European Union-wide, European Commission-funded, <b>ReDNet</b> project survey. An ad-hoc questionnaire was administered to professionals from the departments of Addiction, Psychiatry, Paediatrics and Emergency Room Services in Italy. Results: The interviewees' sample included 243 professionals, mostly from the departments of Addiction (35 %) and Psychiatry (28. 4 %). Overall, interviewees self-reported a poor technical knowledge relating to NPS; some 27 % of respondents confirmed of not being aware if their patients presented with a previous history of NPS misuse. Discussion: Novel psychoactive substances prevalence of misuse was not considered to be an unusual phenomenon in Italy, and most health professionals appeared to have concerns relating to associated medical and psychopathological risks, especially in terms of aggression/psychomotor agitation. Overall, most respondents reported the need to have better access to NPS-related reliable sources of informatio...|$|E
40|$|CASSANDRA {{seeks to}} create a multidisciplinary, cost {{effective}} approach to investigating the supply chain and diffusion of Novel Psychoactive Substances (NPS), by incorporating cutting edge technologies and new social trend indicators into the monitoring of NPS. CASSANDRA has been developed {{in partnership with the}} Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London, United Kingdom, the Institute of Informatics and Telematics of the CNR, Pisa - Italy, and the Substance Abuse Research Centre, Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT), Ireland. This partnership brings together expertise from different fields of research to develop a novel and innovative methodology to understand the supply chain and diffusion of NPS. This project will also capitalize on existing research and the strengths of the Psychonaut 2002, Psychonaut EWS, <b>ReDNet,</b> CODEMISUSED and ALICE RAP projects which for the past 10 years have investigated the role of the Internet in shaping drug use; On the work carried out at WIT which has shown how underground websites (Deep Web) are emerging as ideal market places for both illicit and licit substances, which are also set to revolutionise contemporary drug distribution and use, and are increasingly becoming very popular and more reliable and secure than negotiating illicit drug markets. It will also make use of the know-how developed {{in the past few years}} by the CNR as part of the CAPER, OpeNER, ASIA, and SoS projects which exploit open access information from several social media platforms and websites to find hidden connections among users, monitor social media for the detection and the analysis of events, and developed the technology needed to retrieve, store and analyse online data. Therefore, this project aims at using infodemiology, open source intelligence and qualitative methods to map the Internet to describe the supply chain and diffusion of the most used NPS. In particular we aim to: 1) Map the availability and distribution chain of NPS across multiple websites and online environments (e. g. Tor, social media). 2) Describe how the availability, promotion and distribution of NPS are evolving through out the duration of the project. 3) Describe the life cycle stages of any given substance: Introduction, growth, maturity and/or decline. Including the displacement of established illegal drugs and/or other NPS...|$|E
