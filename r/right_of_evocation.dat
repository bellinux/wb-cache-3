50|$|Important {{contributors}} to the concept <b>of</b> <b>evocation</b> include Henry Cornelius Agrippa, Francis Barrett, Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, Aleister Crowley, Franz Bardon and Kenneth Grant. The work {{of all of these}} authors can be seen as attempts to systematize and modernize the grimoiric procedure <b>of</b> <b>evocation.</b> Many modern authors, such as Peter Carroll and Konstantinos, have attempted to describe evocation in a way independent enough from the grimoiric tradition to fit similar methods of interaction with alleged supernatural agents in other traditions.|$|R

40|$|Lessons in Alchemy is an {{artifice}} with {{a constant}} preoccupation/obsession with {{the transformation of}} silence; specifically a transmutation that gathers insight from the pseudo-science known as alchemy. Although the poems in the collection take on other themes and functions of language, the foundation that brings unity to the collection and to metasilence, can be boiled down to the following: the function and treatment <b>of</b> <b>evocations</b> as the essential units of poetry, the construction <b>of</b> <b>evocation</b> webs as an artifice that will multiply the meaning of ideas/images, and most importantly, an intrusive usage of silence or space in order to deconstruct and alter syntax to ultimately infuse or alchemize that silence/space with meaning. ...|$|R
50|$|Evocative: Environments {{respond to}} {{individuals}} {{based on the}} genes they express (phenotype).

50|$|In {{more recent}} usage, {{evocation}} {{refers to the}} calling out of lesser spirits (beneath the deific or archangelic level), sometimes conceived of as arising from the self.

50|$|Evocation is {{the magical}} art of calling forth spirits, angels or demons to bring spiritual inspiration, do the bidding of the magician or provide information.

25|$|Generally, {{evocation}} is {{used for}} two main purposes: to gather information and to obtain the services or obedience of a spirit or demon. Crowley believed that the most effective form <b>of</b> <b>evocation</b> {{was found in the}} grimoire on Goetia (see below), which instructs the magician in how to safely summon forth and command 72 infernal spirits. However, it is equally possible to evoke angelic beings, gods, and other intelligences related to planets, elements, and the Zodiac.|$|R
