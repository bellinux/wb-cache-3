50|$|All triptans have an indole {{structure}} {{identical to}} the neurotransmitter 5-HT. Classic triptan structure contain side chain on the indole ring, and a basic nitrogen in a similar distance from the indole structure. The main structural difference of the triptans is {{the position of the}} sulfonamide and the side chain attached to it (see figure 1 and table 1). <b>Rizatriptan</b> and zolmitriptan have instead of a sulfonamide a triazole and 2-oxazolidone respectively. Another exception to the classic structure is seen on eletriptan where the nitrogen-alkyl chain connected to the indole ring is replaced with a dimethyl-pyrrolidine, and in naratriptan where the nitrogen-alkyl chain is replaced with an 1-methyl-piperidine ring.|$|E
50|$|Sumatriptan was {{the pioneer}} drug in this class. The second generation's triptans such as zolmitriptan, naratriptan, <b>rizatriptan,</b> almotriptan, {{eletriptan}} and frovatriptan soon became available.Different triptans {{are available in}} different formulations and in different strengths (see table 2). They have been formulated as subcutaneous injections, oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal spray and as rectal suppositories. Delivery system of the triptans may {{play an important role}} in the onset of action. The selection of anti-migraine drug for patients depends on their symptoms. The first selective 5-HT1B/1D agonist, sumatriptan, was first synthesized as a subcutaneous injection, then as an oral tablets and more recently as a nasal spray, it is also available in some countries as suppositories. The subcutaneous injection is the fastest way to stop a rapidly progressing migraine attacks. The sumatriptan nasal spray provides faster onset of action than the tablets but it produces a similar headache response at 2 hours. Some patients prefer the nasal spray as it works more rapidly than the tablets and does not have as many adverse effects as the subcutaneous injection. Nasal spray is although not suitable for all patients, because some patients experience bad taste and lack of consistency of response. Zolmitriptan was developed with the strategy to create a more lipophilic compound, with faster absorption and better ability to cross the blood brain barrier than sumatriptan. It is available as tablets, orally disintegrating tablets and as nasal spray in some countries. <b>Rizatriptan</b> is available as tablets and orally disintegrating tablets but naratriptan, almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan are only available in tablets, for now.|$|E
50|$|Triptan {{structures}} were designed from {{the structure of}} 5-HT to attain affinity to 5-HT receptors, hence the identical indole structure. The hydroxyl group (-OH) on the hexane of the indole core and the alkyl-amine side chain on position C3 on 5-HT have been replaced with other compounds, such as sulfonamides or azol-ring structured derivatives and different amine-alkyl side chains. An electro-negative group can form a hydrogen bond with Thr {{in the pocket of}} the receptor. Sulfonamide derivatives attached to the hexane ring of the indole structure have electro-negative properties, as well as the triazole and 2-oxazolidone on <b>rizatriptan</b> and zolmitriptan respectively. This can increase binding ability of the compound and the efficacy, especially with the 5-HT1D receptor.|$|E

The regulatory condition for meeting the definition of an orally disintegrating tablet is USP method 701 for Disintegration. FDA guidance issued in Dec 2008 is that ODT drugs should disintegrate in less than 30 seconds.

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed at verifying the {{clinical}} characteristics of a typical attack in 20 migraine patients, 10 responders and 10 non-responders to <b>rizatriptan,</b> and at investigating any differences in the levels of neuropeptides of the trigeminovascular or parasympathetic systems [calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neurokinin A (NKA) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) measured by radioimmunoassay methods in external jugular blood] between responders and non-responders. In all responders to <b>rizatriptan,</b> pain was unilateral, severe, and pulsating, and in five of them at least one sign suggestive of parasympathetic system activation was recorded. Five patients who were non-responders to <b>rizatriptan</b> referred bilateral and non-pulsating pain, even though severe in most of them. CGRP and NKA levels measured before <b>rizatriptan</b> administration were significantly higher in responders than in non-responders (P < 0. 0001 and P < 0. 002, respectively). In the five patients with autonomic signs among <b>rizatriptan</b> responders, detectable VIP levels were found at baseline.

Two cost-utility analyses performed from a societal perspective indicated that <b>rizatriptan</b> 10 mg was dominant over ergotamine/caffeine 2 mg/ 200 mg, sumatriptan 50 mg or 100 mg, naratriptan 2. 5 mg, zolmitriptan 2. 5 mg and analgesic-based usual care in the acute treatment of migraine. In one analysis also performed {{from the perspective of}} a healthcare payer, <b>rizatriptan</b> was still dominant over naratriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan. <b>Rizatriptan</b> was cost effective compared with usual care with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of $Can 31 _ 845 (2002 values) and an incremental cost per additional attack aborted of $Can 49. 82. A modelled cost-effectiveness analysis conducted from a healthcare payer's perspective indicated that almotriptan 12. 5 mg was more cost effective than <b>rizatriptan</b> 10 mg as a result of better tolerability. The incremental cost per additional successfully treated patient (defined as being sustained pain free without adverse events) with almotriptan was $US 6. 94 (1999 values). In other nonmodelled cost-effectiveness analyses, <b>rizatriptan</b> 10 mg, eletriptan 40 mg and almotriptan 12. 5 mg most consistently displayed the greatest cost effectiveness in different analyses using different clinical endpoints. A modelled analysis of the costs of migraine-related productivity losses in US corporations indicated that the use of <b>rizatriptan</b> rather than usual care to treat migraines could result in annual cost offsets of approximately $US 84 - 118 (2000 values) per employee in lost productivity avoided. An intervention study in Spanish postal service workers demonstrated that replacement of usual care with <b>rizatriptan</b> reduced the mean per-patient cost of lost productivity per migraine attack from _ 34. 47 (2001 / 2002 values) before the intervention to _ 13. 94 and _ 4. 59 for the first and second post-intervention migraine attacks. In conclusion, <b>rizatriptan</b> is one of the more clinically effective and therefore cost-effective oral triptans available for the acute treatment of migraine. The available data from cost-utility analyses suggest that <b>rizatriptan</b> is more cost effective than ergotamine/caffeine, simple analgesics, naratriptan, zolmitriptan and sumatriptan. The economic value of <b>rizatriptan</b> depends on the payer's perspective, as the greatest savings can be expected to be achieved in terms of reduced migraine-related loss of work productivity compared with less effective treatments. For healthcare payers, the high acquisition cost appears to be at least partly offset by reduced migraine-related healthcare resource use when compared with usual care. The comparative cost effectiveness of the newer triptans requires further elucidation from comprehensive direct comparisons.
