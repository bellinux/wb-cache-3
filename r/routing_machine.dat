This is particularly true for urban areas with varying zones for different air quality levels. We use PM 10 total emission data {{from the state of}} Berlin, Germany. This data provides the amount of PM 10 pollution for a 1 x 1 km grid for Berlin as it represents a major indicator for air pollution. The data is available in Soldner Berlin format (EPSG: 3068). As routing software we use the Open Source <b>Routing</b> <b>Machine</b> (OSRM) with map data for Berlin from OpenStreetMaps (OSM) available at geofabrik. de. Our approach uses the possibility of OSRM to access a PostGIS database from a transportation mode profile. The evaluation compares our approach with a baseline approach which assumes the same speed for all roads. Compared to the baseline approach, the routes calculated with our approach tend to avoid the city center as much as possible, but are still acceptably short (for long distances about 22 % longer than the shortest path) ...|$|E

The writings of Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky provide a background and a particular insight into what Klee calls ‘ [...] . the kinetic energies which move the point into a line, the line into a plane and the plane into a spatial dimension. ’ (Notebooks, Volume 1 : The Thinking Eye) This project adds solid sculptural form - volume - to Klee's sequence by elevating the point from a flat two-dimensional plane to the three-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry. Three key research outcomes were: • A methodology using computer aided drawing (CAD) software, a numerically controlled <b>routing</b> <b>machine,</b> step by step photographic documentation and computer animation was developed {{in the course of the}} project. • A concept change involving the replacement of the rigours of the grid with a process using the intersection of the horizon and gravity as drawing coordinates was introduced. • A method of planar layer construction of solid objects was developed to heighten perception of the pictorial qualities of the object.

40|$|This project {{concerns}} {{the use of}} an electromagnetic sensor for the detection of leaks/cracks in water pipes. As old metal pipes corrode they start to become brittle, resulting in the potential for cracks to appear in the pipes. In addition corrosion can build up resulting in a restricted flow of water in the pipe. Using an electromagnetic (EM) wave sensor to monitor the signal reflected from the pipes in real time, provides the necessary information to determine where a leak in the pipe has occurred. Analysis of the reflected signal can provide the operator with information about the condition and position of a leak within the pipe. This is the first time research has been carried using EM waves for leak detection in water pipelines. This project involves the design and construction of an EM sensor operating at frequencies in the range of 240 MHz to 560 MHz, and at a power of OdBm. The sensor is launched into the water pipeline through any existing hydrant and is moved along the pipeline to check for leaks. The simulation software High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) was used to model the pipe section as a circular waveguide cavity, and also for antenna simulation. The monopole and loop antenna were designed to determine the best antenna for this project. The printed circuit board (PCB) design package Eagle was used to provide the surface mount layout for the sensor, and the PCB board was fabricated by using a computer numerical control (CNC) <b>routing</b> <b>machine.</b> Finally the graphical interface package LabVIEW was used to control the frequency sweep for the sensor and to capture the data from the sensor. Based on the findings of this project, the EM wave sensor could be used to determine a leak up to a 0. 9 correlation limit using low cost RF electronic devices...|$|E
