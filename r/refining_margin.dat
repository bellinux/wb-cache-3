50|$|Refiners’ {{profits are}} tied {{directly}} to the spread, or difference, between {{the price of crude}} oil and the prices of refined products. Because refiners can reliably predict their costs other than crude oil, the spread is their major uncertainty. One way in which a refiner could ensure a given spread would be to buy crude oil futures and sell product futures. Another would be to buy crude oil call options and sell product call options. Both of those strategies are complex, however, and they require the hedger to tie up funds in margin accounts.To ease this burden, NYMEX in 1994 launched the crack spread contract. NYMEX treats crack spread purchases or sales of multiple futures as a single trade for the purposes of establishing margin requirements. The crack spread contract helps refiners to lock-in a crude oil price and heating oil and unleaded gasoline prices simultaneously in order to establish a fixed <b>refining</b> <b>margin.</b> One type of crack spread contract bundles the purchase of three crude oil futures (30,000 barrels) with the sale a month later of two unleaded gasoline futures (20,000 barrels) and one heating oil future (10,000 barrels). The 3-2-1 ratio approximates the real-world ratio of refinery output—2 barrels of unleaded gasoline and 1 barrel of heating oil from 3 barrels of crude oil. Buyers and sellers concern themselves only with the margin requirements for the crack spread contract. They do not deal with individual margins for the underlying trades.An average 3-2-1 ratio based on sweet crude is not appropriate for all refiners, however, and the OTC market provides contracts that better reflect the situation of individual refineries. Some refineries specialize in heavy crude oils, while others specialize in gasoline. One thing OTC traders can attempt is to aggregate individual refineries so that the trader’s portfolio is close to the exchange ratios. Traders can also devise swaps that are based on the differences between their clients’ situations and the exchange standards.|$|E

We allow changes in regime to be influenced by gasoline inventories. We find that low gasoline inventory (stock-out) could trigger a switch from the low margin regime to the high margin regime and also increases the likelihood of staying in the high margin regime.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three studies that focus on applications of vine copulas, a relatively new class of multivariate copula approach, in commodity risk management and price analysis. The first study proposes a vine copula approach to estimate multiproduct hedge ratios that {{minimize the risk of}} <b>refining</b> <b>margin</b> erosion ? the downside risk facing a typical oil refinery whose profit greatly depends on its <b>refining</b> <b>margin</b> or the difference between the prices of its refined products and the cost of crude oil. The out-of-sample hedging effectiveness of two popular classes of vine copula models ? canonical (C-) and drawable (D-) vine copula models ? are evaluated and compared with that of a widely used nonparametric method and three standard multivariate copula models. The empirical results reveal that the D-vine copula model seems to be a good and safe choice in managing the downside risk of the refinery. The second study explores the importance of modeling heterogeneous dependence structures between different pairs of energy commodity returns with vine copulas in improving one-step-ahead density forecasts of these returns. The value of modeling heterogeneous dependence structures is measured by comparing the performance of density forecasts based on vine copulas with density forecasts based on standard copulas that assume homogeneous dependence structures. The empirical results suggest that modeling heterogeneous dependence structures using vine copulas does not help improve quality of multivariate density forecasts of energy commodity returns. The third study applies a vine copula approach to analyze the dependence structure and tail dependence patterns among daily prices of three agricultural commodities (corn, soybean, and wheat) and two energy commodities (ethanol and crude oil) from June 2006 to June 2016. Our findings suggest that the prices of corn and crude oil are linked through the ethanol market. We also find that crude oil and agricultural commodity prices are statistically dependent during the extreme market downturns but independent during the extreme market upturns. Moreover, the results from our sub-sample analysis show that both the upper and lower tail dependence between crude oil and other commodity markets become weaker in the recent years when the ethanol market became more mature...|$|E

40|$|Molecular {{management}} targets {{the right}} molecules {{to be at}} the right place, at the right time and at the right price. It consists of molecular characterisation of refining streams, molecular modelling and optimisation of refining processes, as well as overall refinery optimisation integrating material processing system and utility system on the molecular level. The need to increase modelling details to a molecular level is not just a result of political regulations, which force refiners to managing the molecule properly, but also seems to be a very promising to increase the <b>refining</b> <b>margin.</b> In this work, four aspects of molecular management are investigated respectively. Molecular Type Homologous Series (MTHS) matrix framework is enhanced on both representation construction and transformation methodology. To improve the accuracy and adequacy of the representation model, different strategies are formulated separately to consider isomers for light and middle distillates. By introducing statistical distribution, which takes the composition distribution of molecules into account, the transformation approach is revolutionised to increase the usability, and tackle the challenge of possibly achieving significantly different compositions from the same bulk properties by the existing approaches. The methodology is also enhanced by applying extensive bulk properties. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the methodology. Based on the proposed characterisation method, refining processes are modelled on a molecular level, and then process level optimisation is preformed to have an insight view of economic performance. Three different processes, including gasoline blending, catalytic reforming, and diesel hydrotreating, are investigated respectively. Regarding gasoline blending, the property prediction of blending components, and the blending nonlinearity are discussed. To tightly control on the property giveaway, a molecular model of gasoline blending is developed, and then integrated into the recipe optimisation. As for the conversion processes, catalytic reforming and diesel hydrotreating, reactions and reactors are modelled separately, and then followed by the consideration of catalyst deactivation. A homogeneous rigorous molecular model of a semiregenerative catalytic reforming process, considering pressure drop, has been developed. In addition, a multi-period process optimisation model has been formulated. Regarding diesel hydrotreating, a molecular model of reactions with a three-phase trickle-bed reactor has been developed. The concept of reaction family is successfully applied. A structural contribution approach is used to obtain kinetics and adsorption parameters. A series of procedures are developed to solve the complex problem. Thereafter, a process optimisation model has been developed with the consideration of catalyst deactivation, with a new strategy on the division of catalyst life. Finally, a two-level decomposition optimisation method is extended to incorporate molecular modelling into the overall refinery optimisation, and then applied in two aspects. Firstly, with the integration of the process and the site-level models, a better perspective is obtained with regard to a material processing system. By molecular modelling of refining streams and processes, the integrated approach not only controls the molecules in products properly, but also increases the overall performance. In the second application, a framework integrating a hydrogen network with hydroprocesses is developed to target the maximum profit, rather than saving hydrogen. It allocates hydrogen on the hydrogen network level and utilise hydrogen efficiently on the process level by optimising operating conditions. Consequently, the extent of achieving the maximum profit could be fully exploited with optimal hydrogen utilisation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|MBA, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2005 Setting {{performance}} targets {{for a business}} is a strategically important function. These targets focus the efforts of teams and team members, and as such define the direction of development of the business's competencies and thus its competitiveness. In the highly competitive world of commodities, {{it is imperative that}} resources be focused optimally. This implies that the focus be placed on those few aspects that if achieved, it would yield maximum benefit. The objective of this report is to, for the Natref refinery: • Define and prioritise those business aspects that should be focused on {{over the next three years}} so as to maximise profit and long-term competitiveness, • Define target performance levels for the respective aspects, and • Define interim targets that could be applied in yearly performance incentive schemes. The aspects of importance for Natref have been defined through an analysis of the South African liquid fuel industry, its profit profile and the implications for Natref specifically. Benchmarking was primarily based on the 2002 refinery performance survey, as executed by Solomon Associates. Optimal profit performance is subject to the combination of optimal integration, and optimal relative performance of the contributing functional roles. Over-emphasis of one role relative to another inevitably results in lower than achievable long-term profitability. Benchmarking the relative performance of refineries is complicated by the extensive differences between refineries and their respective business situations. As a result, technical aspects can be consistently compared through a process of normalisation and peer groups. However, no fundamentally sound method could be found to compare the overall performance of refineries in different business situations. Return-on-investment and <b>refining</b> <b>margin</b> were evaluated, but found unsuitable for this purpose. As a compromise, the Profit Index as developed by Natref, is proposed for evaluating integrated refinery performance. In addition, a new parameter, the Profit Potential Index, aimed at measuring growth of relevant value-adding capability, is proposed. Evaluation of and {{performance targets}} for total cash cost, fixed cost, and variable cost, round of evaluation of integrated performance. Total production cost, including fixed and variable cost, has to improve by approximately 10 % to be competitive with the Asia-Pacific peer group and other South African refineries. It is proposed to achieve a 10 % composite cost reduction over the next three years. The targeted improvement in energy consumption, if achieved, could represent the full 10 % reduction in operating cost. It was found that Natrefs performance in terms of energy efficiency was of the poorest of all the refineries included in the 2002 benchmarking survey. Given the increasing cost of energy, it is considered critical to improve energy efficiency. The proposed three-year performance target of 92 Ell, if achieved, will result in matching the average energy performance of the Asia-Pacific peer group, but will still fall short of the energy efficiency of the best performers in the group. Refinery availability is of strategic importance in the current industry situation where Natref production is cut back due. to over-capacity and tactics. It is thus recommended that performance in terms of availability be targeted to be first quartile, whereas third quartile performance was achieved in the 2002 benchmarking survey. The overall availability performance is required to increase to 96. 7 %. The following practices are recommended for implementation in addition to the performance targets set: Operating cost is strongly influenced by the R/$ exchange rate. Systems are required to proactively identify the impact of this exchange rate. In contrast with previous practice of always operating Natref at full capacity, Natrefs production rate is subject to market share, product demand and price competitiveness since termination of the Main Supply Agreement. Sasol' s overall unbalanced product slate results in Sasol being long in petrol production capacity and short in diesel production capacity. Sasol is thus obliged to sell part of its petrol production at discount prices, which motivates other producer-distributors to maximise their production of diesel and to minimise petrol production. Marginal sales are in competition with the marginal cost of production with other South African refineries for inland sales, and with that of Asia-Pacific peer group refineries for export markets. More emphasis is thus required on knowledge of marginal production cost, and on minimising marginal production cost than was before. It is concluded that producer-distributors utilise the imbalance in product supply capacity stemming from Synfuels' product slate to negotiate price discounts. It would thus be in the interest of the producer-distributors to increase their production capacity according to demand growth so as to maintain the petrol over-supply situation and thus reduced purchase prices. The optimisation model for the refinery forms the backbone towards determining not only the marginal cost of production, but also for optimisation of business decisions, crude purchasing, profit apportionment between the Shareholders, and for determining the Profit Index and the Profit Potential Index. As such it is recommended that the accuracy of this model be targeted at 15 USc/bbl. Finally, crude oil cost represents approximately 90 % of the overall production cost. Yet the refinery has only indirect input on crude slate optimisation, i. e. via the accuracy and number of crudes represented in the refinery model. It is recommended that this input be expanded.

40|$|On {{the heels}} of steep {{refinery}} rationalisation in the Atlantic Basin, 2012 was a year of significant rebound for Europe’s ailing refining sector.

The rebound continued strongly into 1 Q 2013, with refinery crack spreads showing a further 24 percent quarter-on-quarter improvement on 2012 figures. However, a number of structural factors that provided a brief respite to Europe’s refining sector in 2012 will evaporate, eroding the atypically healthy margins enjoyed in 2012. The restoration of capacity utilisation rates in the northeast United States’ refining sector in 2 H 2012, along with ongoing projects to debottleneck gasoline flows from the Gulf Coast refining complex to northeast product markets will gradually displace Europe’s gasoline export opportunities through 2013.

40|$|The European Union aims {{to reduce}} {{greenhouse}} gas emissions by 80 % to 95 % below 1990 levels by 2050. For the Netherlands, a reduction of 80 % implies that {{a limited amount of}} 30 Mton CO 2 per annum may be emitted in 2050. Such a reduction could especially affect the Dutch refining industry as it is a large emitter of CO 2 with a total of 11 Mton of CO 2 in 2015. Assuming that the CO 2 budget of the Dutch refining industry also decreases, investments are required that in alternatives that reduce CO 2 emissions. However, due to increasing competition, decreasing European oil demand and thin <b>refining</b> <b>margins</b> these investments cannot be taken for granted. The main research goal of this master thesis is to “To explore the Dutch refining industry, determine the different factors that contribute to their CO 2 emissions and assess which CO 2 reducing alternatives are the most promising”. The Dutch refining industry contains 6 refineries of which 5 are located in the port of Rotterdam. Allocating CO 2 emissions to individual processes shows that the atmospheric distillation unit is most cases the largest emitter of CO 2. Other polluting processes are the FCC unit, hydrocracker and flexicoker. Besides the effect of the refining processes, the CO 2 emissions of Dutch refineries are also influenced by their crude oil intake. CO 2 emissions increase if crude oil has a lower API gravity (heavy) and a high sulphur content (sour). A wide variety of CO 2 reducing options is identified within this master thesis which are assessed by an extended Technology Assessment that incorporates economical and institutional perspectives. In the end, a multi-criteria analysis, that includes the perspectives of multiple actors, is used to identify the most promising CO 2 reducing alternatives. It can be concluded that heat exchange, optimisation of the distillation unit, processing lighter and sweeter types of crude oil and CCU are the most promising CO 2 reducing alternatives.

Although the consequences and transmission mechanisms of oil price shocks have been investigated to some extent for developed economies, the impact volatility and rise of oil price on developing countries and emerging market economies (EMEs) {{have yet to be}} explored. Established in 1969, Singapore Petroleum Company Ltd (SPC) {{has become one of the}} lead players in the local oil industry of Singapore. SPC provides its services in the areas of oil and gas exploration, refining, terminalling and distribution, marketing and trading of crude and refined petroleum products and is the only independent oil refiner in Singapore. Like the rest of the world, the impact of volatility in crude oil prices, SPC has also impacted significantly by swings in <b>refining</b> <b>margins</b> which arise from the interplay of demand and supply for crude oil and refined products. This study aimed at exploring the impact of volatility of crude oil prices on the Singaporean economy in general and particularly on the Singapore oil companies. For this purpose, the meta-analysis method was utilized in order to explore and examine the relevant data and research on the topic and perform a meta-analysis of this data. Data on crude oil, volatility in oil prices and its influence on crude oil companies in Singapore were researched. The research criteria covered the period from 1995 to data and examined the trends in oil markets of USA, Gulf States and the Singapore Petroleum Company Ltd (SPC). First of all, the mechanism of crude oil prices was examined which revealed that in the late 1980 s, price formulas were adopted to set export prices. This involved use of three indices for sales of Middle Eastern crudes to various regions: West Texas Intermediate for sales to the US, Brent for sales to Europe, and a combination of Dubai and Oman for sales to the Asia- Pacific region. In general, marker crude would fulfill certain implicit criteria in that it should be a good representative of all the alternative crudes available to buyers in the region in terms of gravity and sulfur content, produced in significant volumes, and should be liquid, i. e., significantly traded in the physical market. However, such mechanism is not going to be sustained for long due to the fact that an increasing need to cut costs by the Asian refiners would result in the need for more competitive deals. Furthermore, the increasing trend of imports of Atlantic Basin crudes (which are priced off Brent) into Asia-Pacific countries may further pressure Middle Eastern producers to reduce, if not remove, the Eastern Premium. Being a small economy Singapore is a price taker in global trade, that is why, fluctuations in crude oil prices have powerful effects on the economy...|$|R
40|$|The South Atlantic rift system {{developed}} during the Mesozoic breakup of Africa and South America. These continental masses belonged to the Gondwana Palaeozoic super-continent. Rifting started in the south, and propagated toward the north. Lithospheric stretching and rifting in northeastern Brazil culminated {{with the onset of}} sea floor spreading, which probably occured in late Aptian to early Albian times and took place along transform fractures in the equatorial rift zone. The South Atlantic rift system created two very different margins around Brazil: the North and East Brazilian margins. The North Brazilian Equatorial margin evolved in response to strike-slip motion between Brazil and Africa, resulting in complex shear-dominated basins. In contrast, the East Brazilian margin, evolved into a passive margin, as a consequence of orthogonal crustal extension. Potential field data are powerful resources for reducing costs and interpretation risks when petroleum exploration advances towards new frontiers.

The country situation describes politics, economics and business environment, amongst others, together with production and consumption of CPPs which influences international sea trading. The main question is what the developments are of international sea trading in ASEAN. Based on statistical data gathered from international and local sources, the trend of production and consumption is identified for six CPPs (motor gasoline, aviation gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, diesel and naphtha) and what that entails for the countries’ imports and exports. The political situation is variable, with Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei being stable, with Singapore being under control of a strict but well organized political party, striving for big economic growth, Malaysia turning its country into a regional economic powerhouse and Brunei’s Sultan profiting from its abundance of natural resources. Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam are developing, with Vietnam cutting down its long lasting corruption and all countries trying to peacefully end disputes with ethnic minorities. Thailand and Cambodia are considered unstable, due to respectively a military coup and big problems with its ‘democracy’. Looking at economic growth in the analyzed period, Vietnam is by far growing fastest whereas Brunei shows little progression. Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia were hit quite significantly in their economies with the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 - 1998. Singapore is the least corrupted country in the region, followed by Malaysia by a long short. The most corrupted country according to the same source is Indonesia. High regulations, extensive red tape as well as inefficient legal and judiciary system is a common situation in most of the countries in the regionthat worsen the business environment, except for Singapore. Most ASEAN countries have a developed downstream oil industry, except for Vietnam and Cambodia. This is mostly aimed for national consumption. Singapore has a big surplus in refining capacity and has the best developed industry in the region. Looking at CPP production and consumption, Indonesia is the biggest producer and consumer. The production levels have remained rather stable, whereas the consumption has increased significantly. The biggest products are Diesel and MoGas. Looking at the trade flows, between 1996 and 2004, Singapore has been dominating the flows in the developing region, especially as exporter to the other ASEAN countries, even if its production output has been reduced. In the future, the political situation is not expected to show significant shifts. The economic growth will remain biggest in Vietnam and lowest in Brunei over the forecasted period. The business attractiveness in Vietnam is expected to increase significantly, in Singapore it will remain as attractive or even better, and countries like Indonesia and Thailand are trying to work on better procedures. The Philippines are working on privatization projects. The total CPP production is expected to remain rather stable in the projected period and the consumption is expected to increase in ASEAN. Due to regional deficit in production, Singapore is expected to remain a major refining and trading hub, but trading will become more important, because of tight <b>refining</b> <b>margins</b> and big expansions of the storage facilities. Big refining projects are undertaken in Vietnam, which will have influence on the inbound trade flows in this country. The trade flows are expected to come from or go to Singapore most of the time in the near future. Logistics and Transport Managemen...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of an embankment {{is a vital}} consideration in tailings dam design, construction and management. A general overview of dam construction methods, potential failure mechanisms for tailings dam embankments, and different methods of analysis including deterministic and probabilistic analyses are included in this thesis. Deterministic analysis includes {{a discussion of the}} {{stability of}} tailings dam embankments by analysing the factors of safety using unique values of each soil, and geometric, property. The factor of safety is calculated using stability charts (Taylor (1948), Bishop and Morgenstern (1960), and Spencer (1967)), and limit equilibrium methods such as those by Fellenius (1936), Janbu (1954), Bishop (1955), Morgenstern and Price (1965), and Spencer (1967). A parametric study and sensitivity analysis were performed to elucidate the effects of varying the shear strength parameters and embankment geometry on the stability of an embankment. Probabilistic methods of analysis use random variables in place of deterministic values to find a range of factors of safety that describes the inherent variability in both the soil and geometry in the tailings dam. A first order, second moment, (FOSM) analysis and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to describe the factors of safety in a risk analysis-based context. The deterministic and probabilistic methods were applied to simple baseline cases and a case study of an existing tailings dam using hand calculations performed in Microsoft Excel™, and GeoSlope SLOPE/W 2012 software. The embankments were analysed under both short- and long-term conditions (i. e. in terms of both total and effective stress parameters), with the effects of pore water pressure and horizontal seepage considered. This research found that there were advantages and disadvantages to both the deterministic and probabilistic methods of analysis. The deterministic methods were generally easy to use but the input variables were single values which may not accurately reflect the anisotropy or inhomogeneity within the soil in the tailings dam embankment. This could produce factors of safety that are not representative of the entire embankment. On the other hand, probabilistic analyses took into account such anisotropy and inhomogeneity, but required a more detailed understanding and analysis thereof. It was found that deterministic methods of analysis were suitable in calculating factors of safety, however it is also beneficial to perform probabilistic analyses to find the factor of safety and <b>refined</b> safety <b>margins</b> when the variability from uncertainties is included...|$|R
40|$|The {{quest to}} unravel and better {{constrain}} the crustal architecture and related geological processes of South Atlantic margins {{underscores the importance}} of this study. This is true considering the huge economic prospect derivable from this region, especially in the petroliferous conjugate margins of West Africa and Brazil (Cameron et al., 1999). The opening of the South Atlantic Ocean is attributed to the Mesozoic breakup of Gondwana super-continent. The breakup led to the splitting of Proterozoic cratonic blocks (e. g. Sao Francisco and Congo cratons) amalgamated during the Late Precambrian when the Brazilian and Pan African orogenies took place in the west and east parts of the cratonic nucleus, respectively (Alkmin, 2004). The evolution of varied basinal architectures within the South Atlantic conjugate margins took place in response to complex extensional and magmatic regimes initiated during the breakup process. There is a strong rheological control on the overlying Mesozoic-Cenozoic sedimentary basins along the conjugate margins, induced by the underlying different basement terranes which influence the structural evolution of the syn–rift sections (Rosendahl et al., 2005) There have been ambiguities regarding the exact position of the continent-ocean boundary during plate motion reconstructions and early stages of seafloor spreading in the South Atlantic margins. Firstly, the presence of a magnetic quiet zone from early Aptian to Campanian times is inferred as a major obstacle limiting research into anomalies arising from seafloor spreading at neighboring continental margins (Chang et al., 1992). Secondly, the presence of halokinetic structures (e. g. salt diapirs) along the South Atlantic margins blurs the efficient imaging and effective analysis of the syn-rift features (Katz et al., 2000). The bathymetric features in the South Atlantic are fairly symmetric with the central axis being the mid-ocean ridge. This ridge is confined by several structures {{on both sides of the}} abyssal plain, the most prominent being the Rio Grande Rise on the South American side and the Walvis Ridge on the African side. The study area lies between longitude 5 ºE– 11 ºE and latitude 3 ºN– 3 ºS. It stretches from Rio Muni in the NE to central Gabon in the SW. The evolution of these margins is ascribed to the extensional and rifting processes characterizing the South Atlantic development. Fortunately, integration of seismic and potential field data and modeling has advanced our knowledge of the deep crustal structures and fulfills the aims and objectives of this thesis which are to: (1) refine the plate tectonic, rift and shear setting; (2) study and model the crustal structure and refine the continent-ocean boundary and transition; (3) determine and refine the timing of tectonic events, and the wavelength, amplitude and timing of vertical movements; (4) <b>refine</b> the <b>margin</b> segmentation due to a number of transfer faults systems; (5) within a framework of simplified plate reconstructions, discuss the architecture and development of the conjugate Equatorial Guinea-Gabon and Brazilian margins...|$|R
40|$|Hardware and {{software}} for the world's most powerful launch vehicle for exploration is being welded, assembled, and tested today in high bays, clean rooms and test stands across the United States. NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) continued to make significant progress in 2014 with more planned for 2015, including firing tests of both main propulsion elements and the program Critical Design Review (CDR). Developed {{with the goals of}} safety, affordability, and sustainability, SLS will still deliver unmatched capability for human and robotic exploration. The initial Block 1 configuration will deliver more than 70 metric tons of payload to low Earth orbit (LEO). The evolved Block 2 design will deliver some 130 metric tons to LEO. Both designs offer enormous opportunity and flexibility for larger payloads, simplifying payload design as well as ground and on-orbit operations, shortening interplanetary transit times, and decreasing overall mission risk. Over the past year, every vehicle element has manufactured or tested hardware. An RS- 25 liquid propellant engine was hotfire-tested at NASA's Stennis Space Center, Miss. {{for the first time since}} 2009 exercising and validating the new engine controller, the renovated A- 1 test stand, and the test teams. Four RS- 25 s will power the SLS core stage. A qualification five-segment solid rocket motor incorporating several design, material, and process changes was scheduled to be test-fired in March at the prime contractor's facility in Utah. The booster also successfully completed its Critical Design Review (CDR) validating the planned design. All six major manufacturing tools for the core stage are in place at the Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana, and have been used to build numerous pieces of confidence, qualification, and even flight hardware, including barrel sections, domes and rings used to assemble the world's largest rocket stage. SLS Systems Engineering accomplished several key tasks including vehicle avionics software and hardware build and testing, scale model acoustic and base heating tests. Construction of the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) began. Advanced development provided a look into the future of SLS.

40|$|Crude {{and refined}} {{oil prices have}} been {{relatively}} high and volatile on a sustained basis since 1999. This paper considers the pass through of oil prices into consumer liquid (i. e. petrol, diesel and heating) fuel prices in such an environment. The pass through of oil prices into consumer liquid fuel prices has already been addressed extensively in the literature. Nonetheless much of this literature has either focused on the United States or on a time period when oil prices were relatively stable, or has used monthly data. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} a comprehensive combination of many features that have been considered before but rarely jointly. These features include: (1) the analysis of the euro area as an aggregate and a large number of countries (the initial 12 member states); (2) the consideration of different time periods; (3) the modelling of the data in raw levels rather than in log levels. This turns out to have important implications for our findings; (4) the use of high frequency (weekly) data, which, as results will suggest, are the lowest frequency one should consider; (5) the investigation of the different stages of the production chain from crude oil prices to retail distribution [...] <b>refining</b> costs and <b>margins,</b> distribution and retailing costs and margins; (6) the examination of prices including and excluding taxes [...] excise and value-added; (7) the modelling of prices for three fuel types [...] passenger car petrol and diesel separately and home heating fuel oil; (8) lastly we also address the issue of possible asymmetries, allowing for the pass through to vary according to (a) whether price are increasing or decreasing and (b) whether price levels are above or below their equilibrium level. The main findings are as follows: First, as distribution and retailing costs and margins have been broadly stable on average, the modelling of the relationship between consumer prices excluding taxes and upstream prices in raw levels rather than in logarithms has important implications for the stability of estimates of pass through when oil price levels rise significantly. Second, considering spot prices for refined prices improves significantly the fit of the estimated models relative to using crude oil prices. It also results in more economically meaningful results concerning the extent of pass through. Third, oil price pass through occurs quickly, with 90 % occurring within three to five weeks. Fourth, using a relatively broad specification allowing for asymmetry in the pass through from upstream to downstream prices, there is little evidence of statistically significant asymmetries. Furthermore, even where asymmetry is found to be statistically significant, it is generally not economically significant. Lastly, these results generally hold across most euro area countries with few exceptions. Energy Prices Macroeconomy...|$|R
