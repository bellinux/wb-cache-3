5|$|The British {{agreed to}} depart from their forts around the Great Lakes, and the United States-Canada {{boundary}} had to be <b>re-adjusted.</b> Numerous pre-Revolutionary debts were liquidated, and the British opened their West Indies colonies to American trade. Most importantly, the treaty delayed war with Great Britain and instead brought a decade of prosperous trade. The treaty angered the French and became a central issue in many political debates. Relations with France deteriorated after the treaty was signed, leaving succeeding president John Adams {{with the prospect of}} war.|$|E
25|$|Once Rosecrans {{had formed}} a new line, the Pioneer Brigade and Stokes' battery were <b>re-adjusted</b> to fit the line, being moved {{to the front of}} the turnpike and the right of the new line. Additional troops that had been rallied were brought to the right of Morton.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Rykodisc {{released}} , {{billed as}} a Badfinger live recording from 1974. The album underwent substantial re-recording, and a rearranged track order by the album's producer, Molland, and had a mixed critical reaction. The album's release then sparked {{a lawsuit filed by}} Molland. The band's accounting firm, collecting for a 1985 court order settlement, had <b>re-adjusted</b> against Molland's Apple royalty income by deducting away the percentage amounts of that court order, then reimbursing those amounts to the other Badfinger parties. The Rykodisc contract did not include artist royalty payments, because Molland had advised Rykodisc he would take care of that distribution himself under another company name. Molland subsequently sued the other members and their estates to recoup his expenses plus a producer's royalty. He was awarded a partial settlement, as the judge stated the evidence against Molland was insufficient to justify a severe penalty, also noting that since both parties had conceded the original tapes were of a poor quality, Molland's salvaging of them to a commercial level merited consideration.|$|E
2500|$|There is much {{in favor}} of the roller cam brake design. [...] Since the cam {{controls}} the rate of closure, the clamping force can be made non-linear with the pull. And since the design can provide positive mechanical advantage, maximum clamping force can be higher than that of other types of brakes. They are known for being strong and controllable. [...] On the downside, they require some skill to set up and can complicate wheel changes. [...] And they require maintenance: like U-brakes, as the pad wears it strikes the rim higher; unless <b>re-adjusted</b> it can eventually contact the tyre's sidewall.|$|E
2500|$|While he was {{the first}} Prime Minister {{representing}} a constituency in Alberta, his party only won four of the provinces sixteen seats. [...] His speeches to the Empire Clubs in Toronto and Montreal, when chairman of the House of Commons Committee on Representation under Borden that settlers from the United States are suitable to be included with those entitled to vote they lacked the 'noble element' normally found in the British. [...] At the time the federal government as required by a Statue of British Parliament representation to Alberta and Saskatchewan was to be <b>re-adjusted</b> based on the 1911 census. [...] The re-adjustment made to the four western provinces at the time can only be correlated if only those having British and French origins are considered.|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, the {{battalion}} underwent a name change, adopting the territorial {{title of the}} [...] "Hume Regiment", when its recruitment territory was <b>re-adjusted</b> with the 59th Battalion. From 1938 to 1940, the 59th was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Ernest Purnell Hill. In 1940, Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Whalley took {{over the role of}} commander, filling the post until 1942. On 27 August 1942, {{as a result of a}} governmental decision to reduce the size of the Militia and return some of its personnel to civilian industry, the 59th Battalion amalgamated with the 58th Battalion becoming the 58th/59th Battalion. The 58/59th Battalion would go on to see action in World War II in the South-West Pacific during the New Guinea and Bougainville campaigns in 1943–1945. It was disbanded on 23 February 1946.|$|E

60|$|Quickly the tunics were <b>re-adjusted</b> and {{an attempt}} made at re-establishing {{some semblance of}} decorum round the table. Caius Nepos was giving hastily whispered {{directions}} to the waiting-maids.|$|E
60|$|At Diogenes' {{suggestion}} {{they all}} made hasty repairs to their disordered toilet, and <b>re-adjusted</b> {{the set of}} their collars and cuffs {{with the help of}} the small mirror that hung close by against the wall.|$|E
60|$|Matcham {{gave the}} {{required}} oath; and Sir Daniel <b>re-adjusted</b> the hood over his face, and prepared his bell and staff. To see him {{once more in}} that appalling travesty somewhat revived the horror of his two companions. But the knight was soon upon his feet.|$|E
6000|$|He {{sat down}} on the table, and dragged up a chair as a leg-rest. Then he took off his pince-nez, wiped them, <b>re-adjusted</b> the ginger-beer wire behind his ears, and, having hit a brown patch on the knee of his grey flannel {{trousers}} several times, in the apparent hope of removing it, resumed: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hardly like {{to leave}} you, gran'father, in such blustery weather," [...] said a little maiden of about ten years of age, with filthy {{garments}} and a dirty face, who, {{if she had been}} washed and dressed, would have been distinctly pretty, but who, in the circumstances, was rather plain. As she spoke she <b>re-adjusted</b> the garment-screen and removed the snowdrift.|$|E
60|$|Guessing {{the state}} of things {{by the nature of}} the sounds, Big Tim removed the table from under the {{ponderous}} weight, lifted the <b>re-adjusted</b> trap-door, and, springing up, darted into the hut just in time to bestow a parting kick on the last man that struggled through. Running to the breastwork, he beheld his foes tumbling, rushing, crashing, bounding down the track like maniacs--which indeed they were for the time being--and he succeeded in urging them to even greater exertions by giving utterance to a grand resonant British cheer, which had been taught him by his father, and had indeed been used by him more than once, with signal success, against his Indian foes.|$|E

50|$|Ubon United FC {{withdrew from}} the league after playing 16 games, due to a dispute with the Thailand Football Association (FAT). All results were {{declared}} null and void. Ubon were also given a 2-year ban from competing. The league table was <b>re-adjusted</b> accordingly, after FAT previously thought about awarding 2-0 victories for the remaining games.|$|E
50|$|One common {{avenue for}} {{entering}} the trade {{is to start}} as a bike builder or assembler at a local bike shop. This job can range from simply finishing the assembly started at the factory (attaching wheels and handlebars) to more thorough builds in which all systems are <b>re-adjusted</b> to a given level of quality. The range of assembly involvement varies from shop to shop.|$|E
50|$|Most recently, in 2012, First Lady Michelle Obama took on {{the issue}} of school lunches. Changes that she {{initiated}} primarily focused on more specific nutritional requirements. The changes include updated food group nutrition standards, such as vegetable subgroups, <b>re-adjusted</b> meat and grain serving sizes to reflect different school grade ranges, an implemented requirement for whole grains, and milk-fat restrictions. Lower calorie ranges and a 10-year progressive sodium reduction plan also started in 2012.|$|E
50|$|Early {{texts in}} Russian (and in the Russian recension of Church Slavonic) {{demonstrate}} an increasing interchangeability of Ѳ and Ф. Some scribes preferred {{one of the}} two letters and ignored the other. There existed an orthographical system to write Ѳ in an initial position and Ф elsewhere. Since the middle of the 17th century, selection between Ѳ and Ф was <b>re-adjusted</b> to exactly follow the Greek origin, the system still in use in Church Slavonic orthography.|$|E
50|$|As of November 2011 the SB-900 was {{replaced}} by the SB-910 which is technically very similar to the older model. There only are minor changes like the push button on the battery lid, semi transparent function buttons, redesigned soft case, different accessories and <b>re-adjusted</b> thermal cut off circuit to prevent premature shut downs. In terms of power level, looks, inner mechanics and PCB design both units are identical. All SB-900 and SB-910 units are made in Japan.|$|E
50|$|After {{several days}} of {{stunting}} in February 2008, the station was re-branded Pulse 99.5. The new format became an experimental mix of CCM and CHR-pop {{in an effort to}} reach more people through a hybrid format. The new format proved to be a more aggressive change than listeners in the area were ready for, and after a few short months under the new format, Pulse 99.5 <b>re-adjusted</b> its format to a mix of Christian CHR, Rock, and positive, faith-based mainstream hits.|$|E
5000|$|The 98 Custom Flatline barrel must be <b>re-adjusted</b> for {{accuracy}} whenever it is removed and reinstalled. Therefore, it's {{a good idea}} to [...] "mark" [...] where the barrel is aligned for reinstallment. The barrel is surrounded by a plastic shroud that hides the curved barrel and integrates a sight system replacing the marker sight, this is required as the barrel curves above the markers normal sight system. The shroud also have a picatinny rail for mounting accessories that attach onto a rail system.|$|E

5000|$|In normal use, a modem {{can send}} or receive data {{at any point}} in time, a mode of {{operation}} known as [...] "asynchronous". The modem can determine the speed of the sender's data by listening to the bits being sent to it, and [...] "locking" [...] its clock to the speed of bits being received. Since the data can arrive at any time, there is no precise timing; the clock may have to be <b>re-adjusted</b> for pauses as the user stops typing (for instance).|$|E
50|$|In the 1999 case Law v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), the Supreme Court {{tightened}} the Andrews test, limiting burdensome differences in treatment {{to those that}} a reasonable person would say violated the claimant's dignity as a human being. This position was reversed by the Supreme Court in the 2008 case R v Kapp, {{back to the original}} test, but <b>re-adjusted</b> in Quebec (Attorney General) v A in 2013 and again by Kahkewistahaw First Nation v Taypotat in 2015. However, much of the Andrews approach remained the same through these cases.|$|E
5000|$|In 1904 Williams moved that [...] "the present {{boundary}} between the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria and the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria be <b>re-adjusted</b> by bringing the southern portion into Southern Nigeria, so that the entire tribes of the Yoruba-speaking people should be under {{one and the same}} administration".Sir Frederick Lugard had opposed this proposal on the grounds of administrative convenience, and the eventual decision largely followed his beliefs. The principle applied was to group people who were at roughly the same political and social level into one province rather than to try to align the provinces with ethnic boundaries.|$|E
5000|$|On February 14, 1991 (Valentines Day), WBBO-FM flipped to {{contemporary}} hit radio as [...] "Power 93". This move {{brought back the}} format to the nearby Greenville-Spartanburg market that the former WANS (now WJMZ) had before they abandoned it for adult contemporary. Initially, ratings were very good, but quickly fizzled out to 9th place, where it stayed throughout much of its existence. In August of next year, the Power 93 moniker was dropped for [...] "93.3 WBBO" [...] as the station became more Dance-oriented. Again, ratings had shown little improvement and was <b>re-adjusted</b> toward Mainstream CHR within a year.|$|E
50|$|In 1945, the {{incoming}} Kuomintang established the Hsinchu City Government to govern Hsinchu-Chou (Shinchiku Prefecture). In 1946, the Take Over Committee dissolved and Hsinchu County Government was formed. Hsinchu County Government {{was moved to}} Taoyuan. As the administrative districts were readjusted, it became a provincial city, using the original Prefecture office as its legal office, with seven district offices. In February of the same year, representative congress was formed in every district. On April 15 the City Congress was formed. Provincial Representatives were elected from the city legislators, to become legislative bodies of different levels. On 16 August 1950, the administrative districts in Taiwan were <b>re-adjusted</b> once more, demarcating 16 counties and 5 provincially governed cities.|$|E
50|$|Makurdi {{doubles as}} {{the capital of the}} state and the {{headquarters}} of Makurdi LGA, while Gboko and Otukpo double as local government and ethnic headquarters (i.e. for Tiv and Idoma tribes respectively). All the roads in the state radiate from these three centres. As an administrative unit, Benue State was first created on 3 February 1976. It was one of the seven states created by the military administration headed by General Murtala Mohammed, which increased the number of states in the country from 13 to 19. In 1991, its boundaries were <b>re-adjusted</b> with the creation of Kogi State. The new Benue State of today has twenty (23) local government areas, which are administered by local government councils.|$|E
5000|$|Kohei Hirate and Yuji Tachikawa led the {{championship}} for Team Cerumo, having scored 58 points. Following their win at the previous race, TOM'S drivers Kazuki Nakajima and James Rossiter were 2nd in {{the championship}}, four points behind Cerumo. Eight teams in GT500 had a theoretical chance at winning the championship entering the Motegi round. In GT300 Team Mugen had an eight-point lead over Goodsmile Racing's Tatsuya Kataoka and Nobuteru Taniguchi, while in GT300 only five teams had {{a possibility of}} winning the championship. The Balance of Performance was <b>re-adjusted</b> in GT300, the air restrictor sizes for the Honda CR-Z and Subaru BRZ were returned to their sizes that were at the Fuji 300km round.|$|E
