40|$|The {{previous}} research on the pump valve is mostly focused on theory and simulation, but how much precision of these results can be obtained is rarely of concern. A new experimental approach for accurately measuring the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pump</b> valve motion parameters has been presented. An FEA model to describe the pump valve's collision contact statealso been established. Combining the measured valve's velocity and displacement data, the collision contact characteristics in valve assembly during pump operation have been systematically analyzed by ANSYS/LS-DYNA. The von Mises stress in valve disc and its seat changed by the variables such as valve closing speed, mass, diameter, and taper angle in the collision contact process are quantitatively determined, {{as well as the}} relationship between valve's collision contact condition and pump service life. Results show that the experiment and simulation approach can truly and accurately reflect the pump valve's collision process, which provides a scientific basis for the further analysis of pump valve movement and damage mechanism and then improves the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pump</b> design...|$|R
40|$|Sucker rod pumping {{systems are}} the {{dominant}} technology used currently in oil pumping systems for stripper (marginal) wells. The system {{consists of a}} high-speed rotating prime mover, a linear <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pump,</b> a gear reducer and a crank and beam mechanism to translate the high-speed rotating motion into a low-speed linear motion. A sucker rod pumping system requires a relatively large surface area which limits its use in offshore applications. Moreover, the sucker rod pumping system cannot be used in deviated wells because of the long steel sucker rod. In this research, {{the replacement of the}} sucker rod pumping system with a permanent magnet linear motor which drives the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pump</b> directly is presented. In this system, the motor drive is placed on the surface and connected to the motor through a long cable. The motor is placed downhole to drive the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pump.</b> The main challenges of this system result from the high temperature downhole and the long transmission cable and will be discussed in detail. Another system which replaces the AC cable with a DC cable is proposed. In this system, the inverter is integrated with the motor downhole while the rectifier remains on the surface. A modified integrated motor drive with a speed control algorithm is proposed. Moreover, two sensorless algorithms are developed; one for the AC system and one for the DC system. The DC system algorithm estimates the motor position based on the motor model using the current and voltage measurements. The AC system sensorless algorithm utilizes both the motor and cable models to estimate the motor position and motor current. Finally, a pump monitoring system is developed to detect the common pump faults. An observer is developed to estimate the load force from the motor current and speed. The load force could be used along the motor position to identify various fault signatures...|$|R

This novel system targets to make the motor starting with light load, which could reduce the fluctuation in motor torque, decrease the starting time. In this article, a dynamic model and an efficiency model are established to compute the polished rod load dynamometer card and efficiency of the pumping unit. It is shown that the installed springs could help to reduce {{the impact on the}} system when reversing, and significantly decrease the energy consumption.

50|$|A piston is a {{component}} of reciprocating engines, <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pumps,</b> gas compressors and pneumatic cylinders, among other similar mechanisms. It is the moving component that is contained by a cylinder and is made gas-tight by piston rings. In an engine, its purpose is to transfer force from expanding gas in the cylinder to the crankshaft via a piston rod and/or connecting rod. In a pump, the function is reversed and force is transferred from the crankshaft to the piston {{for the purpose of}} compressing or ejecting the fluid in the cylinder. In some engines, the piston also acts as a valve by covering and uncovering ports in the cylinder wall.|$|E

50|$|Pumps in this {{category}} range from simplex, with one cylinder, to in some cases quad (four) cylinders, or more. Many reciprocating-type pumps are duplex (two) or triplex (three) cylinder. They can be either single-acting with suction during one direction of piston motion and discharge on the other, or double-acting with suction and discharge in both directions. The pumps can be powered manually, by air or steam, or by a belt driven by an engine. This type of pump was used extensively in the 19th century—in {{the early days of}} steam propulsion—as boiler feed water pumps. Now <b>reciprocating</b> <b>pumps</b> typically pump highly viscous fluids like concrete and heavy oils, and serve in special applications that demand low flow rates against high resistance.
