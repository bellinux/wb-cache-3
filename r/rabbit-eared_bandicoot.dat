At the time of European colonisation of Australia, there were two species. The lesser bilby became extinct in the 1950s; the greater bilby survives but remains endangered. It is currently listed as a vulnerable species. It is on average 55 cm long, excluding the tail, which is usually around 29 cm long. Its fur is usually grey or white, it has a long pointy nose and very long ears, hence earning its nick-name, the <b>rabbit-eared</b> <b>bandicoot.</b>|$|E
