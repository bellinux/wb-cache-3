30|$|The VSG control {{strategy}} has been introduced to improve the power output characteristic of the renewable energy. Considering the adjustability of VSG’s virtual moment of inertia, we proposed a bang-bang {{control strategy}} for the VSG’s virtual inertia based on the TEF decay method. When the PV-VSG is on the <b>receiving</b> <b>side,</b> and the difference of the angular speed between the sending <b>side</b> and <b>receiving</b> <b>side</b> is positive, the inertia of the PV-VSG is set to a larger value, otherwise, it is set to a smaller value. Under this control strategy, the TEF of the power system after disturbance will decay quickly, and the transient stability of the power system with high penetration PVs will be improved.|$|R
40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} shown that in a cache-enabled {{interference}} channel, the storage at the transmit and <b>receive</b> <b>sides</b> are of equal value in terms of Degrees of Freedom (DoF). This is derived by assuming full Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT). In this paper, we consider a more practical scenario, where a training/feedback phase should exist for obtaining CSIT, during which instantaneous channel state is not known to the transmitters. This results in a combination of delayed and current CSIT availability, called mixed CSIT. In this setup, we derive DoF of a cache-enabled interference channel with mixed CSIT, which depends on the memory available at transmit and <b>receive</b> <b>sides</b> as well as the training/feedback phase duration. In contrast to the case of having full CSIT, we prove that, in our setup, the storage at the <b>receive</b> <b>side</b> is more valuable than the one at the transmit side. This is due to the fact that cooperation opportunities granted by transmitters' caches are strongly based on instantaneous CSIT availability. However, multi-casting opportunities provided by receivers' caches are robust to such imperfection. Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1209. 5807 by other author...|$|R
