40|$|This is an Author's Original Manuscript of {{an article}} {{submitted}} for consideration in the Policing and Society [copyright Taylor & Francis]; Policing and Society is available online at [URL] Football Banning Order was implemented under the Football (Disorder) Act (2000) to target ‘risk’ supporters where the supporter had (a) previously been involved in football-related disorder and (b) {{was likely to be}} involved in future disorder. Although viewed by the government of the day as a necessary tool to tackle football hooliganism, it was criticised by opponents as draconian due to the restrictive conditions that could be imposed via civil process (on complaint) where no criminal conviction needed to be secured. Despite these ethical concerns, little research has considered how those responsible for the operation of the orders identify and target ‘risk’ supporters or the impact orders have on the behaviour of <b>risk</b> <b>supporters.</b> This paper aims to redress this gap in the research by presenting the findings of a number of interviews with police officers responsible for the operation of banning orders. The findings show police officers construct narratives that emphasise the need to control <b>risk</b> <b>supporters</b> and suggest banning orders have worked to serve this function. However, closer analysis of the data suggests that the number of banning orders implemented is partially generated by pressure to deliver targets and a desire of officers to justify and preserve their roles. This raises questions {{about the extent to which}} pressures to ensure banning orders are issued outweigh any ethical concerns over the use of the legislation. Pre-prin...|$|R

5000|$|Shandra's {{take on the}} {{political}} modernization perspective asserts that environmental degradation causes overurbanization, because the destruction of natural resources in rural areas lowers production and increases poverty and health <b>risks.</b> <b>Supporters</b> of {{the political}} modernization perspective suggest that a strong civil society supports lower levels of overurbanization. The presences of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) in rural areas, political protests, and democratic government all have the ability of limiting rural-push factors by limiting factors that lead to resource scarcity. INGOs can reduce overurbanization by stimulating alternative employment outside of agriculture, supporting grassroots movements, and improving rural conditions, such as by providing clean water. [...] Considering the role of political protest, Shandra offers {{the example of the}} Chipko movement in India, where local women protested deforestation. Protection of this natural resource [...] "eliminated the causes (i.e., income risk and health effects) that facilitate rural to urban migration by protecting a natural resource base by which rural residents in India depended for their existence." [...] Given these considerations, Shandra argues that repressive regimes that do not respond to the desires of the public are more likely to cause higher rates of urbanization than democratic governments.|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Avian {{influenza}} (AI) {{has prompted}} widespread poultry culls and retail changes. Traditional live poultry sales can increase risk for AI virus transmission. Attitudes and risk perceptions regarding these sales influence policy. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to report Hong Kong risk perceptions and attitudes regarding live poultry sales and central slaughtering illustrating population reactions to inform policy. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 25 healthy Hong Kong adults completed grounded theory qualitative interviews regarding perceptions of live chicken sales and acceptability of central slaughtering. Taped interviews were transcribed and translated in to English and coded in parallel by the authors working independently, using grounded theory approaches. Findings - The paper finds that hygiene efforts reflected confusion between bacterial contamination and influenza. Hand-transmission was not recognized as a transmission pathway. Opposition to central slaughtering was based on concerns about loss of freshness, flavor, traditions and employment, and meat safety. However, opponents supported policy if it reduced infectious disease <b>risk.</b> <b>Supporters</b> emphasized improved food hygiene. There was considerable scope for further educational efforts. Opposition focused on losses rather than gains, consistent with theory. Supporters emphasized health benefits. AI transmission routes were confused, indicating need for clearer information about personal protective practices. Research limitations/ implications - The paper is a qualitative report and awaits confirmation using a quantitative exploration. The data identified a number of barriers to acceptance of a central slaughtering policy, many of which were based on incorrect or limited understanding. Education can help remedy this. Originality/value - The paper describes perceptions among Chinese people towards a public health initiative, revealing many objections are based on misunderstandings. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Political {{campaigns are}} much more attack-filled in some {{countries}} than in others. What accounts for it? One answer hinges on the country’s party system.

We test the relationship between party system and attack behaviour in New Zealand, which in 1996 changed from a single-member district, first-past-the-post system to a mixed-member proportional system. The result was a more fragmented party sys-tem, resulting in coalition and minority governments.

50|$|When the Treaty of London was {{announced}} in May 1915, there was an uproar from antiwar elements. Salandra resigned {{but no one could}} form a majority against him, and he returned to office. Most politicians, and indeed most Italians opposed the war, including most Catholics. Reports from around Italy showed the people feared war, and cared little about territorial gains. Rural folk saw war is a disaster, like drought, famine or plague. Businessmen were generally opposed, fearing heavy-handed government controls and taxes, and loss of foreign markets. Reversing the decision seemed impossible, for the Triple Alliance did not want Italy back, and the king's throne was at <b>risk.</b> Pro-war <b>supporters</b> mobbed the streets {{with tens of thousands of}} shouting by nationalists, Futurists, anti-clericals, and angry young men. Benito Mussolini, an important Socialist Party editor took a leadership role, but he was expelled from the Party and only a minority followed him. Apart from Russia this was the only far left party in Europe that opposed the war. The fervor for war represented a bitterly hostile reaction against politics as usual, and the failures, frustrations, and stupidities of the ruling class.|$|R
40|$|To date, neither {{theoretical}} approaches nor empirical findings allow clear {{predictions about}} the influence of sport engagement on youth violence. The present study uses a typological approach to investigate groups of adolescents with different characteristics of violent behaviour and cognition regarding their sport background and psychological variables associated with violent behaviour. A sample of 2438 Swiss adolescents aged 12 - 18 years completed five self-report questionnaires on sport engagement, violent behaviour and cognition, self-concept, wellbeing, and stress perception. After in-depth data cleaning and method checking, the data of 832 participants were clustered using the Ward method. Five reliable clusters based on violent behaviour and cognition can be identified: non-violent adolescents, adolescents at <b>risk,</b> violence <b>supporters,</b> psychological harassers, and violent adolescents. Harassers are most engaged in sports and are over-represented among elite athletes. Violent adolescents are over-represented in game sports with body contact, whereas non-violent adolescents are involved in individual sports with a focus on aesthetic factors. Results further reveal that non-violent adolescents scored highest on general self-concept and relationship to parents, whereas harassers scored highest on general sport abilities. Moreover, harassers and violent adolescents have the least favourable values on different scales of wellbeing and stress perception. Given the cross-sectional nature of the study, no conclusion about selection or socializing processes can be drawn. Further in-depth consideration is needed to advance our understanding of the relationship between sport, psychological dimensions, and violence...|$|R

40|$|Hallmark {{events are}} favoured by {{policy-makers}} {{due to their}} assumed effects on destination image, social and infrastructural developments and economic benefits. They are also criticised because these targets are seldom met. However, {{little is known about}} the dynamics of forming a tourism destination image (TDI) under the influence of event visitors’ travel experiences. In this paper, the three-gap model was used to provide a better understanding of this dialectic process from the travellers’ perspective. The three-gap model describes which factors influence TDI and highlights the importance of pre-visit expectations compared to travel experiences. There was a special focus on the ‘environmental bubble’ as a relevant concept for destinations where safety might pose a real risk and present danger. The 2010 FIFA World Cup was chosen for an explorative multi-method case study, focusing on travelling Dutch fans. The results show that before the event, the international media and Dutch fans who planned to visit the event saw serious safety <b>risks.</b> However, <b>supporters</b> did not retreat into the provided environmental bubbles which might prevent them from contact with the host community and would limit authentic experiences. They used these bubbles rather as a launching pad for venturing into the country. A gap between expectation and experience was present, after their visit the Dutch fans evaluated South Africa more as a country which is safe to travel in. The paper concludes that when not organised too rigidly, environmental bubbles might pre-empt potentially negative gaps between visitors’ experiences and expectations. In turn, this may contribute to travellers feeling a greater sense of autonomy than implicitly assumed by tourist organisations, a change in their travel behaviour and their TDI. status: publishe...|$|R

In his contribution, Erlinghagen distinguishes between two streams concerning the flexibility-debate on labour market policy in Germany.

Both lines of argumentation share {{the fact that they are}} in favour of, even if stating different points of view, a reform of the “old-fashioned ” German labour market and its institutions via deregulation. Before rejecting theoretical objections which concern conclusions that are too simple in his view, he empirically proves that neither job stability has decreased, nor that the German labour market has become inflexible. However, he refers to the fact that he only considers the situation in West Germany. In addition to Marcel Erlinghagen’s contribution, the following article therefore deals wit...|$|R

The failure to release results was strongly criticised by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, which unsuccessfully sought an order from the High Court to force their release.

50|$|A key {{theme in}} the {{assessment}} by non-Marxist historians {{is the question of}} whether the referendum debates put a strain on the Weimar compromise between the moderate labour movement and the moderate middle class. In this context, the focus is on the policy of the SPD. Peter Longerich notes that it was not possible to convert the relative success of the referendum into political capital. In his opinion, the referendum also hampered cooperation between the SPD and the bourgeois parties. This aspect is stressed most by Heinrich August Winkler. It is understandable, he says, that the SPD leadership supported the referendum so as not to lose touch with the Social Democratic base. But the price was very high. The SPD, he says, found it difficult to go back to the familiar path of class compromise after 20 June 1926. The debate about the expropriation of the former rulers shows the dilemma of the SPD in the Weimar Republic. When they showed themselves willing to compromise with the bourgeois parties, they ran the <b>risk</b> of losing <b>supporters</b> and voters to the Communist Party. If the SPD stressed class positions and joined in alliances with the Communist Party, they alienated the moderate bourgeois parties and tolerated that they sought allies on the right of the political spectrum who were not interested in the continued existence of the republic. The referendum had weakened, not strengthened, confidence in the parliamentary system and had created expectations that could not be fulfilled. In Winkler's view, the resulting frustration could be only destabilising for representative democracy. Winkler's position is clearly distinct from that of Otmar Jung.|$|R
40|$|Patterns of agonistic {{support and}} {{affiliation}} among adult female and juvenile rhesus macaques were studied {{on the island}} of Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico. It was found that, when entering coalitions on behalf of kin, individuals tended to provide support when recipients were most vulnerable and in need of aid. When individuals aided nonkin, different patterns resulted depending on the age/sex class of the opponent: when individuals intervened against adult male opponents, they tended to do so when recipients were most vulnerable and in need of support. However, when individuals intervened against adult female or juvenile opponents, they did so when recipients were least vulnerable and the <b>risk</b> to the <b>supporter</b> was low. Individuals formed coalitions at highest rates and highest risk with close kin, at intermediate rates and intermediate risk with intermediate/distant kin, and at lowest rates and lowest risk with nonkin. Findings suggest that individuals distinguish among several classes of kinship when choosing how frequently, with whom, and at what level of risk to form coalitions; a 2 ̆ 2 threshold 2 ̆ 2 hypothesis of kinship is therefore rejected in this population in favor of a more complex, graduated pattern of kin relationships. Kin coalitions are likely to have evolved primarily through kin selection; nonkin coalitions probably evolved as a cooperative strategy to reinforce rank and deter male aggression. Reciprocal altruism is unlikely to be a mechanism for the evolution of coalitions. At least two models have been proposed which suggest that females cultivate coalition partners through grooming and other affiliative behaviors, a model of affiliation-for-support, also called the rank-related attractiveness model, proposed by Seyfarth (1976, 1977), and a model based on a similarity principle, proposed by de Waal and Luttrell (1986). Neither model was supported in this population. An alternative model is proposed in which animals primarily maintain close relationships with kin, with whom they groom, contact-sit, remain in proximity, and support in coalitions. High rates of grooming directed towards high-ranking females is explained in terms of appeasement and avoidance of aggression rather than as an attempt to cultivate coalition partners. ...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2013. Major: Communication Studies. Advisor: Ronald Walter Greene. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 256 pages. This dissertation, Changing Rhythms: Media and Globalisation in the English Premier League, focuses on two interrelated questions: 1) {{what are the}} consequences of globalising the English Premier League, acknowledging that to understand the globalisation of the English Premier League is to fundamentally understand its mediapoly and 2) how has the English Premier League's media policy managed the tension between its globalisation strategy and the embodied rituals associated with English soccer culture. In answering these questions, I argue that the current League structure, while it has been of financial benefit to some, has failed to sustain its founding mission of enhancing the English national team and of improving the experiences of supporters. It is unquestionably true that the League's media policy, through its international broadcasting strategy, has brought more supporters to the game, but this pursuit of international <b>supporters</b> has <b>risked</b> alienating local communities. Through archival research and an analysis of policy documents, I argue that advances in media technologies and changes in broadcasting policy have allowed the English Premier League to increase both its revenue and global presence, but this global initiative has had profound effects on how English supporters relate to their teams (which have traditionally been deeply embedded within their community). In addition, to changes in broadcasting policy, the structure of the Premier League has been made possible by changes to European Union labour laws that have, unintentionally, posed challenges to the League's structure by, in conjunction with media policy, creating new opportunities for international players. These new migration flows are at the centre of debates over the future of the English national team. As the League expands, global fan bases have developed whose only experience of the League has come through its mediatisation. While the League <b>risks</b> alienating local <b>supporters,</b> I suggest that there is also an opportunity to build affective supporter communities outside the local communities where the clubs are located through the development of new television-based forms of supporter rituals. As such, I see the potential of temporal practices as the key to understanding the mediatised rituals, which supporters, both locally and globally, develop. In conclusion, I argue that it might be time for a new model within the Premier League, one that firmly places football as a matter of cultural policy with a re-emphasis placed on the interests of supporters rather than those of the League governing structure, club owners and satellite television...|$|R
