5|$|Commandante Teste {{served with}} the Mediterranean Squadron upon {{commissioning}} in 1932. She was <b>refitted</b> between November 1935 and August 1936 when her 100mm guns were given gun shields. From September 1937, she was based at Oran to protect neutral shipping from commerce raiders during the Spanish Civil War. In February 1938, she was <b>refitted</b> in Toulon to upgrade her catapults and then served as an aviation transport between France and her colonies in North Africa.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, the Mahan-class destroyers began {{a wartime}} {{armament}} refitting process, {{but most of}} the class was not fully <b>refitted</b> until 1944. Mahan was <b>refitted</b> in June 1944 at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. The notable refits to the Mahan-class included the removal of one 5 inch/38 gun, typically replaced with two twin Bofors 40 mm guns and five 20 mm Oerlikon guns.|$|E

She was present when the High Seas Fleet surrendered for internment on 21 November.|$|E
50|$|During the war, Morden {{had four}} {{significant}} <b>refits.</b> Her first major <b>refit</b> {{took place at}} Southampton for a two-month <b>refit</b> beginning in November 1941 after escorting her first convoy. The second was a brief <b>refit</b> at Lunenburg, Nova Scotia in June 1943. Her third major <b>refit</b> took place at Derry from November 1943 until January 1944, during which her fo'c'sle was extended. Mordens final major <b>refit</b> was begun in December 1944 at Sydney and completed in May 1945 at Halifax.|$|R
50|$|INS Seaward (T54) was {{commissioned}} in September 1982. Its medium <b>refit</b> {{was due in}} March 1988 and its long <b>refit</b> in April 1992. Ignoring the vulnerability to corrosion of this ship, the medium <b>refit</b> was delayed by over three years and was carried out from July 1991 to April 1992. As a result, the long <b>refit</b> could not be planned. However, another short <b>refit</b> including {{the replacement of the}} engines was taken up in December 1993. The short <b>refit</b> was converted into a medium <b>refit</b> in February 1994. While carrying out repairs, extensive damage to the hull below the waterline was noticed in March 1994. The medium <b>refit</b> was extended to May 1996 because the engines and other materials procured for this ship were used for carrying out ongoing repairs on another, similar, ship (SDBT-55).|$|R
40|$|Background/AimsThe {{modification}} of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scoring system (<b>Refit</b> MELD) and the {{modification of}} MELD-Na (<b>Refit</b> MELDNa), which optimized the MELD coefficients, were published in 2011. We aimed to validate {{the superiority of the}} <b>Refit</b> MELDNa over the <b>Refit</b> MELD for the prediction of 3 -month mortality in Korean patients with cirrhosis and ascites. MethodsWe reviewed the medical records of patients admitted with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites to the Konkuk University Hospital between January 2006 and December 2011. The <b>Refit</b> MELD and <b>Refit</b> MELDNa were compared using the predictive value of the 3 -month mortality, as assessed by the Child-Pugh score. ResultsIn total, 530 patients were enrolled, 87 of whom died within 3 months. Alcohol was the most common etiology of their cirrhosis (n= 271, 51. 1 %), and {{the most common cause of}} death was variceal bleeding (n= 20, 23 %). The areas under the receiver operating curve (AUROCs) for the Child-Pugh, <b>Refit</b> MELD, and <b>Refit</b> MELDNa scores were 0. 754, 0. 791, and 0. 764 respectively; the corresponding values when the analysis was performed only in patients with persistent ascites (n= 115) were 0. 725, 0. 804, and 0. 796, respectively. The significant difference found among the Child-Pugh, <b>Refit</b> MELD, and <b>Refit</b> MELDNa scores was between the Child-Pugh score and <b>Refit</b> MELD in patients with persistent ascites (P= 0. 039). ConclusionsRefit MELD and <b>Refit</b> MELDNa exhibited good predictability for 3 -month mortality in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. However, <b>Refit</b> MELDNa was not found to be a better predictor than <b>Refit</b> MELD, despite the known relationship between hyponatremia and mortality in cirrhotic patients with ascites...|$|R
