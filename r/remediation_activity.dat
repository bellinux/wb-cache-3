Nevertheless, different qualitative and quantitative methods to estimate the environmental impacts of soil <b>remediation</b> <b>activities</b> are available. In the present study, three case studies were worked out, for which several remediation options were evaluated for a soil and groundwater contamination with mineral oil and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, based on data of the soil remediation project itself or on data from pilot projects. The evaluation tools that were simultaneously used for all the case studies consisted of the ‘Best Available Technique not Entailing Excessive Costs’ method, a life cycle-based evaluation method and a CO 2 calculator.

In addition, decommissioning and remediation programs have common resources needs that, when identified and fully utilized in an integrated framework, can result in optimizing the use of available resources to achieve radiological risk-based results faster and at lower costs. To achieve this, {{it is necessary that}} the goals of individual decommissioning and <b>remediation</b> <b>activities</b> are aligned and not conflict with each other while costs are minimized and net health, safety, security and environmental benefits are maximized. Managing the decommissioning and <b>remediation</b> <b>activities</b> in an integrated program can result in enhanced environmental conditions, and/or reduced requirements for additional remediation work, both of which impact the effort to achieve the ultimate site remediation objectives. The most important step in this process is the establishment of the site remediation objectives, which principally involves selecting the best re-use option for the site. Different technological approaches and different sequences of decommissioning and remediation tasks can be taken to transform the site to achieve its intended end-state.

40|$|Disposal of {{millions}} of gallons of existing radioactive wastes in underground storage tanks is a major <b>remediation</b> <b>activity</b> for the United States Department of Energy. These wastes include a substantial volume of insoluble sludges consisting of submicron colloidal particles. Processing these sludges under the proposed processing conditions presents unique challenges in retrieval, transport, separation, and solidification of these waste streams. Depending on processing conditions, these colloidal particles can form agglomerated networks having high viscosities that could clog transfer lines or produce high volumes of low-density sediments that interfere with solid-liquid separations. Under different conditions, these particles can be dispersed to form very fine suspended particles that do not settle. Given the wide range of waste chemistries present at Department of Energy sites, it is impractical to measure the properties of all treatment procedures.

Proper waste management is essential for preventing unacceptable environmental degradation from ongoing operations, and is also a critical part of any environmental <b>remediation</b> <b>activity.</b> Logistics modeling allows for analysis of alternate scenarios for future waste flowrates and routings, facility schedules, and processing or handling capacities.

Data were supplemented by investigation of a relationship between gamma response and mineralogical and textural characteristics of local glacial sediment using the rotosonic core from MW- 96. Core sediments were sampled and sieved, optically point-counted, and clay-sized fractions were subject to X-ray diffraction analysis to establish QFL fractions, textural fractions, and clay mineralogy.

40|$|Given its {{relevance}} as hazard to human health, today almost unanimously accepted, indoor Rn is increasingly subject to regulation {{with the purpose}} of reducing the risk. While so far, investigations were mostly focused on domestic indoor Rn, attention has been extended to working environments, as people spend good (or bad) part of their life in offices, schools, shops, factories and other workplaces. In the recently issued European Basic Safety Standards (BSS 2014) the same maximum reference levels for indoor Rn concentration, long-term mean 300 Bq/m³, were therefore set for dwellings and workplaces. Many national and regional indoor surveys exist for dwellings, but only a few for schools and kindergartens and little for other workplaces. In particular schools are given increasing attention because they are workplaces for students and teachers alike, and avoiding unnecessary risk to children is naturally seen as an especially important objective. It must be assumed that buildings on top of a ground with the same radon potential, but with different building characteristics and usage patterns, as is typically the case for dwellings and schools, have systematically different indoor Rn concentrations. Although this is well accepted, little is known about how these differences can be quantified, and what their extent is. We show on indoor Rn datasets of schools and dwellings from several regions in South-East Europe how such relations can be estimated and give results. These can be used for identifying regions in which one may decide to allocate resources preferentially for intensified surveys or mitigation or <b>remediation</b> <b>activity,</b> specifically targeted to a type of indoor environment. ...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the <b>remediation</b> <b>activity</b> of oil degrading bacterial strains, {{contained in a}} dried microbial consortium inoculant, it is required to distinguish between degradation activities operated by native microbiota and that due to the newly introduced strains. The effect due to chemical compounds contained into the inoculant as a support should also be considered. Previous studies showed that in an aged polluted soil the autochthonous microbial population seems to be highly specialized for diesel fuel degradation, {{probably due to the}} long period of time under such a selective pressure. Therefore, the use of microbial inoculants might fail to improve the rate of soil remediation. Previous experiments indicated that using formulation specifically designed for diesel degradation, the oil content in the soil was strongly and rapidly reduced under lab-scale if promptly applied after the contamination occurrence. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate on the effect of both the microbial inoculant, and the chemicals compounds, on the rate of oil degradation in a newly contaminated soil. This was attained by the construction of lab-scale biopiles artificially contaminated with diesel fuel and equipped with recycling systems to simulate a field scale structure. The results obtained showed that in the inoculated biopile the diesel oil content decreased approximately to 20 % of the initial value, while it remained constant in the non inoculated one. No effects were due to the chemicals contained in the formulation. DNA based techniques confirmed an effective colonization of soil by the bacterial consortium present in the inoculan...|$|E

40|$|Any {{release of}} anthrax spores in the U. S. would require action to decontaminate {{the site and}} restore its use and {{operations}} as rapidly as possible. The <b>remediation</b> <b>activity</b> would require environmental sampling, both initially {{to determine the extent}} of contamination (hazard mapping) and post-decon to determine that the site is free of contamination (clearance sampling). Whether the spore contamination is within a building or outdoors, collecting and analyzing what could be thousands of samples can become the factor that limits the pace of restoring operations. To address this sampling and analysis bottleneck and decrease the time needed to recover from an anthrax contamination event, this study investigates the use of composite sampling. Pooling or compositing of samples is an established technique to reduce the number of analyses required, and its use for anthrax spore sampling has recently been investigated. However, use of composite sampling in an anthrax spore remediation event will require well-documented and accepted methods. In particular, previous composite sampling studies have focused on sampling from hard surfaces; data on soil sampling are required to extend the procedure to outdoor use. Further, we must consider whether combining liquid samples, thus increasing the volume, lowers the sensitivity of detection and produces false negatives. In this study, methods to composite bacterial spore samples from soil are demonstrated. B. subtilis spore suspensions were used as a surrogate for anthrax spores. Two soils (Arizona Test Dust and sterilized potting soil) were contaminated and spore recovery with composites was shown to match individual sample performance. Results show that dilution can be overcome by concentrating bacterial spores using standard filtration methods.
