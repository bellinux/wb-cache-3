5|$|The silvery blue color {{glass facade}} {{was first used}} on the <b>Reuters</b> Building in New York City.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{institutions}} concerning {{themselves with the}} works of <b>Reuter</b> are the Fritz <b>Reuter</b> Gesellschaft e.V. in Neubrandenburg, the Fritz-Reuter-Literaturmuseum in Stavenhagen, the Reuter-Wagner-Museum in Eisenach, and the Fritz <b>Reuter</b> Literary Archive (Fritz <b>Reuter</b> Literaturarchiv) Hans-Joachim Griephan in Berlin. The latter archive keeps an index of the letters from and to Fritz <b>Reuter.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Fritz <b>Reuter</b> Literary Archive {{came into}} being during the early 1970s, based on private initiative, and {{literary}} interest in Fritz <b>Reuter.</b> Its founder is Hans-Joachim Griephan, journalist and former editor, who originally hails from Mecklenburg. The archive tries to be a gathering and documenting site for Fritz <b>Reuter,</b> his time and his contemporaries. Included as well are authors who influenced <b>Reuter</b> literarily, who see themselves {{in the tradition of}} Fritz <b>Reuter,</b> have done research on Fritz <b>Reuter</b> and his time, or have written about Fritz <b>Reuter</b> and his works.|$|R

5|$|According to a <b>Reuters</b> report, Meat Loaf and Steinman {{started working}} on an album in 2001. During the concerts in his Hair of the Dog tour, Meat Loaf made a point to mention that he and Steinman were putting out a new album.|$|E
5|$|As of 2013, David's {{estimated}} {{net worth}} was $900 million. However, the estimate {{according to a}} former <b>Reuters</b> reporter {{does not take into}} account the divorce. David also disputes the figure, saying he has nowhere near that amount.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reuter</b> {{concession}} cancellation however {{resulted in}} the second <b>Reuter</b> concession {{which led to the}} formation of Imperial Bank of Persia by Baron Julius de <b>Reuter.</b>|$|R

5|$|In July 2011, The Daily Telegraph {{reported}} that Mosley was financially guaranteeing the court costs of claimants {{who may have}} been subjected to phone hacking by the News of the World. Mosley refused to comment at the time, but he later gave a TV interview to the BBC and telephone interview to <b>Reuters</b> where he confirmed the story.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to France2, the Associated Press and <b>Reuters</b> also had camera crews at the junction. They captured brief {{footage of the}} al-Durrahs and Abu Rahma. Abu Rahma was the only journalist to film the moment the al-Durrahs were shot.|$|E
5|$|Jamal, Muhammad, the Associated Press cameraman, and Shams Oudeh, the <b>Reuters</b> cameraman, took cover {{against the}} {{concrete}} {{wall in the}} south-east quadrant of the crossroads, diagonally across from the Israeli outpost. Jamal, Muhammad and Shams Oudeh crouched behind a three-foot-tall (0.91 m) concrete drum, apparently part of a culvert, that was sitting against the wall. A thick paving stone sat {{on top of the}} drum, which offered further protection. Abu Rahma hid behind a white minibus parked across the road about 15metres away from the wall. The <b>Reuters</b> and Associated Press cameramen briefly filmed over Jamal and Muhammad's shoulders—the cameras pointing toward the Israeli outpost—before the men moved away. Jamal and Muhammad did not move away, but stayed behind the drum for 45 minutes. In Enderlin's view, they were frozen in fear.|$|E

5|$|<b>Reuters</b> {{journalist}} Keith Coffman {{stated that}} the defeat {{was a sign that}} Democrats who control Colorado government had reached too far, not just on gun-control, but in other areas also, such as not considering religious exemptions for same sex adoptions, or same-day voter registration.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Queen's in 1928, Wilfrid Eggleston began {{writing for the}} locally printed Lethbridge Herald. He wrote under Canadian Senator William Ashbury Buchanan, whom had {{acquired}} ownership of the newspaper in 1905. Eggleston held Buchanan and his politics in high regard during his short stay at the publication. After just one year writing in Lethbridge, he became Ottawa correspondent for the Toronto Star in 1929, and witnessed significant political events in this position, including {{the passing of the}} Statute of Westminster in 1931 and the British Empire Economic Conference of 1932. He also began writing through the media agency <b>Reuters</b> in the late 1920s by means of a syndicated weekly newspaper column, with a selection of his political pieces featuring in Time Magazine and a plethora of other noted publications. By the time Eggleston had resigned from the Toronto Star in 1936, he had risen to become the newspaper's parliamentary correspondent; he'd finished reporting through <b>Reuters</b> within the same year.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} why France2, the Associated Press and <b>Reuters</b> did not film the scene {{directly}} after the shooting, including the {{shooting death of}} the ambulance driver who arrived to pick up Jamal and Muhammad. Abu Rahma's footage stops suddenly after the shooting of the father and son, then begins again—from the same position, with the white minibus behind which Abu Rhama was standing visible in the shot—with other people being loaded into an ambulance.|$|E

Russian officials had {{de facto control}} of South Ossetia's security institutions, including the armed forces; South Ossetia's de facto government was largely staffed with Russians and South Ossetians with Russian passports, who had occupied equivalent government positions in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Co-writer Sabra Chartrand {{graduated}} from the University of Washington, and reported for <b>Reuters</b> and Israel Radio in Tel Aviv, Israel. She later joined The New York Times as a journalist with their Jerusalem bureau.

5|$|In 1880 the Burne-Joneses bought Prospect House in Rottingdean, near Brighton in Sussex, {{as their}} holiday home, {{and soon after}} the next door Aubrey Cottage to create North End House, {{reflecting}} {{the fact that their}} Fulham home was in North End Road. (Years later, in 1923, Sir Roderick Jones, head of <b>Reuters,</b> and his wife, playwright and novelist Enid Bagnold, were to add the adjacent Gothic House to the property, which became the inspiration and setting for her play The Chalk Garden).|$|E
5|$|In 1994, The Jakarta Post {{signed a}} {{distribution}} {{agreement with the}} British news service <b>Reuters</b> and the American Dialog Information Services, allowing its stories to be more easily promoted overseas. By the mid-1990s, it had established a workshop to assist its new, foreign-born staff in learning the local culture. By December 1998, The Jakarta Post had a circulation of 41,049, {{and was one of}} the few English-language dailies in Indonesia after the 1997 Asian financial crisis; six other English-language dailies had failed. That year it also became a founding member of the Asia News Network.|$|E

After the Machtergreifung of the NSDAP, the family was forced to flee Germany and they found exile in Ankara, Turkey. So <b>Reuter</b> {{spent much of his}} childhood in Turkey. In 1946, Edzard joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).|$|R
50|$|The <b>Reuter</b> {{agency was}} {{established}} in 1851 by Paul Julius <b>Reuter</b> in Britain at the London Royal Exchange. Paul <b>Reuter</b> worked at a book-publishing firm in Berlin and was involved in distributing radical pamphlets {{at the beginning of}} the Revolutions in 1848. These publications brought much attention to <b>Reuter,</b> who in 1850 developed a prototype news service in Aachen using homing pigeons and electric telegraphy from 1851 on in order to transmit messages between Brussels and Aachen.|$|R
