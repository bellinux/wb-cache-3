40|$|A major {{constraint}} to farmer {{acceptance of}} irrigation management tools {{is that many}} farmers find that most tools lack {{a sense of familiarity}} and/or are relatively complex, time-consuming and confusing to operate. In order to address these issues a spreadsheet-based irrigation management tool, “ZIMsched ” has been developed with farmer participation. Because the tool is spreadsheet based many farmers find it familiar to use and are quick to relate to it. In this paper ZIMsched is presented and the internationally proven concepts and algorithms which are used in ZIMsched to account for: l runoff generation, deep drainage and <b>rainfall</b> <b>effectiveness,</b> l the effects of temperature on the rate of canopy and root development, and l yield estimates that are sensitive to the effects of both under and over-irrigation (and excessive rain), soils and climate, are described. ZIMsched is proving popular with both estates and individual growers in Zimbabwe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractErmenek River {{is one of}} the two {{rivers that}} {{constitute}} the upper basin of Göksu River, {{one of the most important}} rivers which flow into the Mediterranean Sea in South Turkey. This research was conducted in order to identify the climatic features of the aforementioned basin. The climatic observations obtained from the three meteorological stations in the basin form the basic data of the study. These data were analyzed and converted to maps and charts. Planetary and geomorphological factors shape the climatic features in the research area. The Mediterranean climate, with its hot and dry summers and rainy winters, prevails over the basin. However, because the study area is between Central Anatolia and the Mediterranean region, and a large part of the area is at least 1500 meters above sea level, Mediterranean mountain climate is seen especially in higher regions. <b>Rainfall</b> <b>effectiveness</b> decreases from the west to the east. As Mediterranean climate prevails in the lower parts of the basin, Mediterranean mountain climate is dominant in higher areas...|$|E
40|$|Paddy rice {{constitutes}} a staple crop in Korea. This study conducted sensitivity analysis {{to evaluate the}} vulnerability of paddy rice to future climate change, and compared temporal and regional characteristics to classify regions with unfavorable water balances. <b>Rainfall</b> <b>Effectiveness</b> Index for Paddy fields (REIP), the ratio of effective rainfall and consumptive use, {{was used as a}} sensitivity index. Weather data from 1971 to 2010 and future climate change scenarios Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4. 5 and 8. 5 were used to evaluate the sensitivity. Results showed an overall increase in water requirements and consumptive use. The REIP values were small for every period, except the 2040 s, 2060 s, and 2080 s under scenario RCP 4. 5, and the 2040 s and 2080 s under scenario RCP 8. 5. Both climate change scenarios showed high sensitivity in regions Jeollabuk-do, Jeollanam-do, and Gyeongnam-do. However, regions Gyeonggi-do, Gangwon-do, and Chungcheongbuk-do had low sensitivity compared to other regions. The REIPs were used to categorize sensitivity into four types: low consumption–water rich, low consumption–water poor, high consumption–water rich, and high consumption–water poor. The Gangwon-do region had the highest number of regions that changed from the low consumption–water rich category to the high consumption-water poor category, making it a priority for measures to improve its adaptive capacity for climate change...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Parental and segregating populations {{derived from}} four winter x spring wheat crosses were {{investigated}} {{to obtain information}} concerning the inheritance and association of earliness, grain yield and yieldrelated traits. Feasibility of selecting in early generations for these characteristics was also evaluated. Four winter wheat cultivars (Hyslop, Yamhill, Bezostaia 1, and Sprague) and one spring wheat cultivar (Inia 66) were chosen {{on the basis of}} their relative maturity and contrasting agronomic characteristics. Parents, F₁ s, F₂' s, and reciprocal backcrosses to both parents were planted in the fall in a space-planted randomized complete block design. The two environmentally diverse locations selected were the Hyslop Agronomy Farm, Corvallis, Oregon (1000 mm of rainfall) and Sherman Experimental Station, Moro, Oregon (250 mm of <b>rainfall).</b> The <b>effectiveness</b> of early generation selection for the measured characteristics was evaluated by growing F₃ lines identified as the earliest 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{availability}} of rainfall data is fundamental for most hydrological analyses {{and for the}} design and {{management of water resources}} systems. There are many methods of spatial interpolation of <b>rainfall</b> despite their <b>effectiveness</b> and ease of use variables, the choice of one or the other depends on the aim of the study, but also on the territorial context of the area (surface, network density, etc.). The study area is the coastal city of Annaba located in eastern Algeria, and which contains a low rainfall network density. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the most adequate rainfall interpolation technique. Three interpolation techniques, determinist and stochastic, have been tested by visual observation and cross-validation, the best results were achieved by inverse distance weighting to characterize rainfall distribution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The common slope {{stability}} analysis is inca-pable of accurately forecasting shallow slides where suction pressures {{play a critical}} role. This realization is used for elaborate stability analyses which include soil suction to better predict rainfall-induced slides at railway embankment at Malda where three known cases of slope failures and train derailments occurred after heavy rain-fall. The relationship between the soil–water content and the matric suction is established for the embankment soil. It is then used in the coupled analyses of seepage and {{slope stability}} to estimate performances of the embank-ment at different intensity and duration of rainfall. The numerical simulations are performed with the FE code Geo-Studio. The numerical results show significant reduction in the factor of safety of the railway embank-ment {{with the increase in}} the intensity and duration of <b>rainfall.</b> The <b>effectiveness</b> of the proposed mitigation measures including placement of 2 m-wide free draining rockfill across the slopes and drilling 5 -m-long sheet pile wall at the toe of the embankment is studied numerically. The study confirms that the proposed mitigation measures effectively increase the factor of safety of the embank-ment and stabilizing it even in case of a heavy rainfall of 25 mm/h over 12 h...|$|R
40|$|Defining and categorizing {{drought in}} a {{quantitative}} and scientific manner are important national issues for Australian state and Commonwealth governments, landholders, and agribusiness. The challenge for modelers of Australia’s grasslands is to integrate biological models, geographic information systems (GIS), satellite imagery, economics, climatology, and visual high-performance computing into an Internet-deliverable application {{that can provide}} easily understood monitoring and prediction advice in near real-time— a national drought alert strategic information system. Although NOAA satellite-derived imagery has been somewhat useful in the broad-scale spatial assessment of green cover, especially the spatial response of vegetation to rainfall events (Smith, 1994; Dudgeon et al., 1990; Filet et al., 1990), it has inherent limitations in providing a total solution for drought and rangeland monitoring; biomass relationships are not good, tree cover confounds the signal, and a future projection of the current situation is not inherent. Also, {{the interpretation of the}} imagery does not usually consider the effects of soil type, vegetation structure, or rangeland “condition. ” Similarly, rainfall analyses alone do not necessarily reflect {{the quantity and quality of}} pasture available on the ground. In the recent 1991 – 95 record-breaking drought in Queensland, rainfall analyses did not map the drought-declared southwestern areas of the state as droughted, and, conversely, coastal areas of the state were classed as droughted by rainfall analyses, when there was no community push for their declaration. Measures of <b>rainfall</b> <b>effectiveness</b> expressed as measures of plant biomass are required for drought definition. Improved assessments of the quantity and quality of biomass are needed, as well as consideration of herbivore densities and future climatic scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Hydrological {{processes}} {{control the}} behaviour of many unstable slopes, and their importance for landslide activity is generally accepted. The presence of fissures influences the storage {{capacity of a}} soil and affects the infiltration processes of <b>rainfall.</b> The <b>effectiveness</b> of the fissure network depends upon fissure size, their spatial distribution, and connectivity. Moreover, fissure connectivity is a dynamic characteristic, depending {{on the degree of}} saturation of the medium. This research aims to investigate the influence of the fissure network on hydrological responses of a landslide. Special attention is given to spatial and temporal variations in fissure connectivity, which makes fissures act both as preferential flow paths for deep infiltration (disconnected fissures) and as lateral groundwater drains (connected fissures). To this end, the hydrological processes that control the exchange of water between the fissure network and the matrix have been included in a spatially distributed hydrological and slope stability model. The ensuing feedbacks in landslide hydrology were explored by running the model with one year of meteorological forcing. The effect of dynamic fissure connectivity was evaluated by comparing simulations with static fissure patterns to simulations in which these patterns change as a function of soil saturation. The results highlight that fissure connectivity and fissure permeability control the water distribution within landslides. Making the fissure connectivity function of soil moisture results in composite behaviour spanning the above end members and introduces stronger seasonality of the hydrological responses...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Utilizing a {{rainfall}} simulator, a sunlight simulator, and a wind generator, the Utah Water Research Laboratory (UWRL), Utah State University (USU), {{completed in}} 1979 and 1981 {{a series of}} evaluations of erosion control products for CONWED Corporation. Increasingly more commercial products for controlling erosion are being produced nationally and there remains a need {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of these, one against another, in order that potential users may make cost-effective decisions in their use. CONWED recognizes this need and has funded the comparative testing of its own products and some of those of leading competitors throughout the country. The objective of the study presented herein was to evaluate under the <b>rainfall</b> simulator the <b>effectiveness</b> of CONWED Hydro Mulch mixed with each of three different commerical products used as tackifiers, Terra Tack I, M-Binder, and Hydro Bond. The study included also the evaluation of three specialy erosion control products, also the evaluation of three specialty erosion control products, CONWED netting, Lud low jute blanket, and American Excelsior blanket...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the joint {{sampling of the}} rainfall and streamflow processes. The sampling frequencies {{in time and space}} are obtained as a function of basin and <b>rainfall</b> characteristics. The <b>effectiveness</b> of different sampling strategies is measured by the variance of the error of estimated or predicted streamflow. This is related to the rainfall and basin rainfall-discharge properties through parameterizations of these processes. Rainfall is modelled as a stochastic process with covariance structure separable in time and space. Streamflow is parameterized in terms of the fluvial geomorphology of the basin. Linear systems theory is used to link precipitation to flow and to compute the variance of basin discharge. The variance of the error in prediction of streamflow is computed in terms of the following: (1) basin and rainfall model parameters; and (2) measurement strategy consisting of numbers of rain gages plus rainfall and flow measurement intervals. This error variance is used to assess the effectiveness of a measurement strategy. The results should be of use in the formulation of hydrologic sampling strategies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the sampling of rainfall and discharge processes both {{in time and}} in space and links the sampling problem to basin and <b>rainfall</b> characteristics. The <b>effectiveness</b> of different sampling strategies {{is measured by the}} variance of the error in estimating either total or peak of streamflow from a single storm event. This is related to the rainfall and basin rainfall-discharge properties through parameterizations of these processes. Rainfall is modeled as a collection of rain cells which occur randomly in space and time and has parameters which define the probability of occurrence of rain cells in space and time and the spread of rainfall due to a cell. Discharge from rainfall is parameterized in terms of the fluvial geomorphology of the basin. Linear filtering techniques are used to compute the variance of the estimation error for different sampling strategies. Sampling strategies are defined by the number of rain gages, rainfall sampling interval and discharge measurement interval. The results can be used in hydrologic network design to assess the effectiveness of different sampling options...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of <b>rainfall</b> on the <b>effectiveness</b> of herbicides applied post-emergence on plants of Senna obtusifolia. The experiment was carried out under green-house conditions and the experimental design was completely randomized design with four replications, with treatments in a 7 x 8 factorial arrangement (seven herbicides treatments and eight rain intervals). The herbicides used were five formulations of glyphosate (Roundup Original, Roundup WG, Roundup Transorb, Roundup Transorb R and Roundup Ultra) applied at a rate of to 1, 080 g a. e. ha- 1, glufosinate-ammonium (Finale) at 400 g a. i. ha- 1 and 2, 4 -D (DMA 806) at 1, 000 g a. e. ha- 1. The rain simulation occurred at intervals of 15; 30; 60; 120; 240, 360, and 480 minutes after the herbicides application. A control treatment without herbicide application was added. Visual evaluations of control plants were taken at 7; 14; 21 and 28 days after application and at the end the dry mass of plants was determined. The rain occurrence after 15 minutes of application of glyphosate formulations Roundup Transorb, Roundup Transorb R and Roundup Ultra did not affect the control efficiency on plants of S. obtusifolia. For formulations of Roundup Original and Roundup WG and, 2, 4 -D it was necessary a 30 minutes period without rain for an efficient control of weed...|$|R
40|$|X-band-radar-based {{quantitative}} precipitation estimation (QPE) {{system is}} increasingly gaining interest {{thanks to its}} strength in providing high spatial resolution rainfall information for urban hydrological applications. However, prior to such applications, a variety of errors associated with X-band radars are mandatory to be corrected. In general, X-band radar QPE systems are affected by two types of errors: 1) common errors (e. g. mis-calibration, beam blockage, attenuation, non-precipitation clutter, variations in the raindrop size distribution) and 2) “wind drift” errors resulting from non-vertical falling of raindrops. In this study, we first assess the impacts of different corrections of common error using a dataset consisting of one-year reflectivity observations collected at an X-band radar site and a distrometer along with rainfall observations in Beijing urban area. The common error corrections demonstrate promising improvements in the rainfall estimates, even though an underestimate of 24. 6 % by the radar QPE system in the total accumulated rainfall still exists as compared with gauge observations. The most significant improvement is realized by beam integration correction. The DSD-related corrections (i. e., convective–stratiform classification and local Z - R relationship) also lead to remarkable improvement and highlight the necessity of deriving the localized Z - R relationships for specific <b>rainfall</b> systems. The <b>effectiveness</b> of wind drift correction is then evaluated for a fast-moving case, whose results indicate both the total accumulation and the temporal characteristics of the rainfall estimates can be improved. In conclusion, considerable potential of X-band radar in high-resolution rainfall estimation can be realized by necessary error corrections...|$|R
