40|$|Abstract. Law {{enforcement}} agencies routinely collect both <b>rolled</b> and plain <b>fingerprints</b> {{of all the}} ten fingers of suspects. These two types of fingerprints complement each other, since <b>rolled</b> <b>fingerprints</b> are of larger size and contain more minutiae, and plain fingerprints are less affected by distortion and have clearer ridge structure. It is widely known in the law enforcement community that searching both <b>rolled</b> and plain <b>fingerprints</b> can improve the accuracy of latent matching, but, this {{does not appear to}} be a common practice in law enforcement. To our knowledge, only rank level fusion option is provided by the vendors. There has been no systematic study and comparison of different fusion techniques. In this paper, multiple fusion approaches at three different levels (rank, score and feature) are proposed to fuse <b>rolled</b> and plain <b>fingerprints.</b> Experimental results in searching 230 latents in the ELFT-EFS Public Challenge Dataset against a database of 4, 180 pairs of <b>rolled</b> and plain <b>fingerprints</b> show that most of the fusion approaches can improve the identification performance.

As AFIS developers attempted to reduce the cost and improve the usability of these systems for commercial applications, plain impression imagery was adopted and total scanned image area was significantly reduced. This paper will attempt to quantify the effects of reduced image area on overall system accuracy in a single finger plain impression environment. The results can be directly applied by AFIS designers as they attempt to meet systems requirements with respect to key accuracy parameters such as false match rates, false non-match rates and the resulting workload caused by the system. ...|$|R

In crime sense fingerprints have been extensively used for identification of criminals. Fingerprints are classified as rolled, plain and latent fingerprints. Latent fingerprints are lifted from surface of objects that are unintentionally touched by person. Latent means poor quality of images or unclear image i. e. smudgy, blurred, moist, small area or fingerprints that contains fewer amount of minutiae. Matching latent fingerprints over rolled or plain fingerprints that is difficult task.

40|$|Abstract—With the {{availability}} of live-scan palmprint technology, high resolution palmprint recognition has started to receive significant attention in forensics and law enforcement. In forensic applications, latent palmprints provide critical evidence as {{it is estimated that}} about 30 percent of the latents recovered at crime scenes are those of palms. Most of the available high resolution palmprint matching algorithms essentially follow the minutiae-based fingerprint matching strategy. Considering the large number of minutiae (about 1, 000 minutiae in a full palmprint compared to about 100 minutiae in a <b>rolled</b> <b>fingerprint)</b> and large area of foreground region in full palmprints, novel strategies need to be developed for efficient and robust latent palmprint matching. In this paper, a coarse to fine matching strategy based on minutiae clustering and minutiae match propagation is designed specifically for palmprint matching. To deal with the large number of minutiae, a local feature based minutiae clustering algorithm is designed to cluster minutiae into several groups such that minutiae belonging to the same group have similar local characteristics. The coarse matching is then performed within each cluster to establish initial minutiae correspondences between two palmprints. Starting with each initial correspondence, a minutiae match propagation algorithm searches for mated minutiae in the full palmprint. The proposed palmprint matching algorithm has been evaluated on a latent-to-full palmprint database consisting of 446 latents and 12, 489 background full prints. The matching results show a rank- 1 identification accuracy of 79. 4 %, which is significantly higher than the 60. 8 % identification accuracy of a state of the art latent palmprint matching algorithm on the same latent database. The average computation time of our algorithm for a single latent-to-full match is about 141 ms for genuine match and 50 ms for impostor match, on a Windows XP desktop system with 2. 2 GHz CPU and 1. 00 GB RAM. The computation time of our algorithm is an order of magnitude faster than a previously published state of the art algorithm.

Compared to good quality full fingerprints acquired using live-scan or inking methods during enrollment, latent fingerprints are often smudgy and blurred, capture only a small finger area, and have large nonlinear distortion. For this reason, features (minutiae and singular points) in latents are typically manually marked by trained latent examiners. However, this introduces an undesired interoperability problem between latent examiners and automatic fingerprint identification systems (AFIS); the features marked by examiners are not always compatible with those automatically extracted by AFIS, resulting in reduced matching accuracy. While the use of automatically extracted minutiae from latents can avoid interoperability problem, such minutiae {{tend to be very}} unreliable, because of the poor quality of latents. In this paper, we improve latent to full fingerprint matching accuracy by combining manually marked (ground truth) minutiae with automatically extracted minutiae.

We call this the “HandShot ID System. ” We obtain well-focused, high-resolution images through the use of multiple cameras. We obtain high-contrast, surface-topology-discriminant images in HandShot through the use of oblique blue light and special spot lights from various angles operating sequentially in millions of a second. We obviate the need for an operator to individually roll fingers through the use of cameras positioned at different angles. By obviating the rolling of fingers, we enable truly high-throughput processing. We also eliminate sequencing errors by having physically distinct right and left hand non-contact placement areas and by simultaneously capturing all 10 digits and both palms. We eliminate the need for routine cleaning of a glass platen by eliminating any glass platen and instead directly image hands in the air –i. e., capture is contactless. For the same reason, we eliminate hygiene concerns. In order for HandShot to accurately and instantly capture and record friction ridge skin detail on 10 rolled-equivalent fingerprints and both palm prints within 5 seconds, HandShot constructs a visual 3 -dimensional model of both hands, including palms, fingerprints, fingertips, and sides of the fingers. Our associated HandShot algorithms: (1) stitch images from multiple cameras together forming a complete 3 -D model of both hands using active models to normalize for pose; (2) extract ridge detail based on contrast assessment under varying illumination effects; and, (3) translate 3 -D images to standardized formats. Having robust, detailed and extensive images supports traditional, as well as, new and improved applications in criminal, security and commercial identification, recognition and authentication tasks. For example, extraction of 10 <b>rolled</b> equivalent <b>fingerprints</b> from the 3 -D model is possible for forensic comparison.

40|$|Abstract—Identifying {{suspects}} {{based on}} impressions of fingers lifted from crime scenes (latent prints) is a routine procedure that {{is extremely important}} to forensics and law enforcement agencies. Latents are partial fingerprints that are usually smudgy, with small area and containing large distortion. Due to these characteristics, latents have a significantly smaller number of minutiae points compared to full (<b>rolled</b> or plain) <b>fingerprints.</b> The small number of minutiae and the noise characteristic of latents make it extremely difficult to automatically match latents to their mated full prints that are stored in law enforcement databases. Although a number of algorithms for matching full to full fingerprints {{have been published in}} the literature, they do not perform well on the latent to full matching problem. Further, they often rely on features that are not easy to extract from poor quality latents. In this paper, we propose a new fingerprint matching algorithm which is especially designed for matching latents. The proposed algorithm uses a robust alignment algorithm (descriptor-based Hough transform) to align fingerprints and measures similarity between fingerprints by considering both minutiae and orientation field information. To be consistent with the common practice in latent matching (i. e. only minutiae are marked by latent examiners), the orientation field is reconstructed from minutiae. Since the proposed algorithm relies only on manually marked minutiae, it can be easily used in the law enforcement applications. Experimental results on two different latent databases (NIST SD 27 and WVU latent databases) show that the proposed algorithm outperforms two well optimized commercial fingerprint matchers. Further, a fusion of the proposed algorithm and commercial fingerprint matchers leads to improved matching accuracy.

To reduce this markup cost and to improve the consistency in feature markup, fully automatic and highly accurate (“lights-out ” capability) latent matching algorithms are needed. In this paper, a dictionary-based approach is proposed for automatic latent segmentation and enhancement towards the goal of achieving “lights-out ” latent identification systems. Given a latent fingerprint image, a total variation (TV) decomposition model with L 1 fidelity regularization is used to remove piecewise-smooth background noise. The texture component image obtained from the decomposition of latent image is divided into overlapping patches. Ridge structure dictionary, which is learnt from a set of high quality ridge patches, is then used to restore ridge structure in these latent patches. The ridge quality of a patch, which is used for latent segmentation, is defined as the structural similarity between the patch and its reconstruction. Orientation and frequency fields, which are used for latent enhancement, are then extracted from the reconstructed patch. To balance robustness and accuracy, a coarse to fine strategy is proposed. Experimental results on two latent fingerprint databases (i. e., NIST SD 27 and WVU DB) show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation and enhancement algorithms and boosts the performance of a state-of-the-art commercial latent matcher.

40|$|Abstract—Latent {{fingerprints}} {{are routinely}} recovered from crime scenes and are compared with available databases of known fingerprints for identifying criminals. However, current procedures to compare latent fingerprints to large databases of full (<b>rolled</b> or plain) <b>fingerprints</b> {{are prone to}} errors. This suggests caution in making conclusions about a suspect’s identity based on a latent fingerprint comparison. A number of attempts have thus been made to measure the utility of a fingerprint comparison in making a correct accept/reject decision or its evidential value. These approaches, however, either do not represent the stateof-the-art in fingerprint matching due to unrealistic modeling assumptions or they lack simple interpretation. We argue that the posterior probability of two fingerprints belonging to different fingers given their match score, {{referred to as the}} Non-match probability (NMP), effectively captures any implicating evidence of the comparison. NMP is computed using state-of-the-art matchers and is easy to interpret. To incorporate the effect of image quality, number of minutiae, and size of the latent on NMP value, we compute the NMP vs. match score plots separately for image pairs (latent and full fingerprints) with different characteristics. Given the paucity of latent fingerprint databases in public domain, we simulate latent fingerprints using two full fingerprint databases (NIST SD- 14 and Michigan State Police) by cropping regions of three different sizes. We appropriately validate this simulation using four latent databases (NIST SD- 27 and three proprietary latent databases) and two state-of-the-art fingerprint matchers to compute their respective match scores. We also describe the way a latent fingerprint examiner would use the proposed framework to compute the evidential value of a latent-full print pair comparison in practice.

40|$|Automatic {{fingerprint}} identification systems (AFIS) {{have for}} a long time used only minutiae for fingerprint matching. But minutiae are only a small subset of fingerprint detail routinely used by latent examiners for fingerprint matching. This has generated {{a lot of interest in}} extended feature set (EFS) with the aim of narrowing down the gap between the performance of AFIS and latent examiners. Level 3 features constitute the most significant subset of extended features. Studies on level 3 features have reported significant improvement in the fingerprint recognition accuracy. However, these studies were based either on live-scan <b>fingerprints</b> or full (<b>rolled</b> or slap) <b>fingerprints.</b> As a result, the conclusions of these studies cannot be extended to latent fingerprints, which are characterized by small size, poor image quality, and severe distortion compared to full fingerprints. In this paper, we study the utility of level 3 features, including pores, dots, incipient ridges, and ridge edge protrusions, for latent matching. Automatic algorithms for extracting and matching these features are proposed. While most existing level 3 feature matching algorithms only consider the locations of features, the proposed method utilizes the topological relationship between level 3 and level 2 features, and is thus robust to nonlinear distortion and has high discriminative capability. Given the proposed algorithms and operational latent fingerprint databases, we identify the challenges in using level 3 features, and show the potential of level 3 features in improving latent matching accuracy. Further, by using simulated partial fingerprints, we highlight that level 3 features can indeed improve latent matching accuracy when i) level 3 features can be reliably extracted in both latent and full fingerprints and ii) latent fingerprints have only a small number of minutiae or the minutiae match scores are low. With the increasing adoption of 1000 ppi fingerprint scanners in law enforcement agencies, it is becoming feasible and desirable to incorporate level 3 features into AFIS. We believe that the proposed algorithms and analysis will be useful in the design and development of next generation AFIS...|$|R
