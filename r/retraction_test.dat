In the years following, this first description of batroxobin was shown to have several uses in surgery. Because of the increasing interest in the properties of batroxobin, several studies on its hemostatic effect and coagulation have been published. More recently, in 1979, a German study showed the uses of batroxobin (reptilase clot <b>retraction</b> <b>test)</b> as a replacement test for the more commonly used thrombin time. Because the enzyme is unaffected by heparin, it is mostly used when heparin is present in blood. Recent studies emphasize more on improving its uses in surgery, mostly spinal surgery, and the uses as serine protease.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveWe have {{previously}} shown that microfractured ovine defects are repaired with more hyaline cartilage when the defect is treated with in situ-solidified implants of chitosan–glycerol phosphate (chitosan–GP) mixed with autologous whole blood. The objectives {{of this study}} were (1) to characterize chitosan–GP/blood clots in vitro, and (2) to develop a rabbit marrow stimulation model {{in order to determine the}} effects of the chitosan–GP/blood implant and of debridement on the formation of incipient cartilage repair tissue. MethodsBlood clots were characterized by histology and in vitro clot <b>retraction</b> <b>tests.</b> Bilateral 3. 5 × 4 mm trochlear defects debrided into the calcified layer were pierced with four microdrill holes and filled with a chitosan–GP/blood implant or allowed to bleed freely as a control. At 1 day post-surgery, initial defects were characterized by histomorphometry (n= 3). After 8 weeks of repair, osteochondral repair tissues between or through the drill holes were evaluated by histology, histomorphometry, collagen type II expression, and stereology (n= 16). ResultsChitosan–GP solutions structurally stabilized the blood clots by inhibiting clot retraction. Treatment of drilled defects with chitosan–GP/blood clots led to the formation of a more integrated and hyaline repair tissue above a more porous and vascularized subchondral bone plate compared to drilling alone. Correlation analysis of repair tissue between the drill holes revealed that the absence of calcified cartilage and the presence of a porous subchondral bone plate were predictors of greater repair tissue integration with subchondral bone (P< 0. 005), and of a higher total O'Driscoll score (P< 0. 005 and P< 0. 01, respectively). ConclusionsChitosan–GP/blood implants applied in conjunction with drilling, compared to drilling alone, elicited a more hyaline and integrated repair tissue associated with a porous subchondral bone replete with blood vessels. Concomitant regeneration of a vascularized bone plate during cartilage repair could provide progenitors, anabolic factors and nutrients that aid in the formation of hyaline cartilage...|$|R

30|$|Overhead {{translation}} of the glenohumeral joint requires a balance activity of scapular-stabilizing muscle to maintain the so-called scapulohumeral rhythm, that is, the gliding motion of the anterior surface of the scapula on the posterolateral surface of the thoracic cage [1]. The fatigue of the scapular stabilizer muscles alters scapulohumeral rhythm and induces a decrease of the rotator cuff (RC) strength. Kibler et al. [2] explored the relationship between apparent supraspinatus weakness and scapular dyskinesis, while Smith et al. [3] reported {{the effect of the}} scapula repositioning on isometric shoulder elevation strength. In our previous paper [4] we described a practical test to assess infraspinatus strength with the scapula retracted (infraspinatus scapula <b>retraction</b> <b>test,</b> ISRT) versus infraspinatus strength with the scapula free (infraspinatus strength test, IST) in professional volleyball players with scapular dyskinesis.

Although purified fibrin monomer prepared from the patient's fibrinogen polymerised normally, the addition of purified paraprotein caused a dose dependent reduction in the rate of polymerisation.

40|$|Gulfstream Aerospace {{has long}} been {{interested}} {{in the development of}} an economically viable supersonic business jet (SBJ). A design requirement for such an aircraft is the ability for unrestricted supersonic flight over land. Although independent studies continue to substantiate that a market for a SBJ exists, regulatory and public acceptance challenges still remain for supersonic operation over land. The largest technical barrier to achieving this goal is sonic boom attenuation. Gulfstream's attention has been focused on fundamental research into sonic boom suppression for several years. This research was conducted in partnership with the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) supersonic airframe cruise efficiency technical challenge. The Quiet Spike, a multi-stage telescopic nose boom and a Gulfstream-patented design (references 1 and 2), was developed to address the sonic boom attenuation challenge and validate the technical feasibility of a morphing fuselage. The Quiet Spike Flight Test Program represents a major step into supersonic technology development for sonic boom suppression. The Gulfstream Aerospace Quiet Spike was designed to reduce the sonic boom signature of the forward fuselage for an aircraft flying at supersonic speeds. In 2004, the Quiet Spike Flight Test Program was conceived by Gulfstream and NASA to demonstrate the feasibility of sonic boom mitigation and centered on the structural and mechanical viability of the translating test article design. Research testing of the Quiet Spike consisted of numerous ground and flight operations. Each step in the process had unique objectives, and involved numerous test team members from the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) and Gulfstream Aerospace. Flight testing of the Quiet Spike was conducted at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center on an F- 15 B aircraft from August, 2006, to February, 2007. During this period, the Quiet Spike was flown at supersonic speeds up to Mach 1. 8 at the maximum design dynamic pressure of 685 pounds per square foot. Extension and <b>retraction</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted at speeds up to Mach 1. 4. The design of the Quiet Spike to shape the forward shock wave environment of the aircraft was confirmed during near-field shock wave probing at Mach 1. 4.

The same tendency was also observed in surgical cases without the transfusion. This change was correlated with post-operative oliguria. 3) The effect of the reduction of bleeding time by administration of synthetic serotonin was not constant, but passing. 4) In coagulation studies on serotonin added to blood in vitro, no effect was found concerning coagulation time, prothrombin time, recalcification time or clot <b>retraction</b> <b>test.</b> On the thrombelastogram, it was observed that coagulation was accelerated in lower serotonin concentration, while suppressed in higher serotonin concentration. 5) In preserved blood, whole blood serotonin and platelet serotonin levels were decreased.

40|$|Abstract — Solenoid valves {{are used}} in air braking system in heavy vehicles. This is {{essentially}} used to prevent skidding in vehicles. Traditionally the coil uses copper wounded coils for producing the working flux for plunger attraction. Recent Cu price increases motivate careful examination of approaches to minimize Cu use. Approaches that can reduce Cu use without increasing losses include careful winding design, trading winding volume for core volume; replacing Cu with Al. Al wire is particularly attractive. The cost of Al is lower than it might appear from the cost per unit mass when the much lower density of Al is also considered, and the disadvantage of higher resistivity becomes less important. This paper shows the design details of a solenoid valve with aluminum wiring along with {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of copper and aluminum.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{architecture of}} rat sciatic nerve {{has been described}} as a central core surrounded by a sheath, although the way in which these structures contribute to the overall mechanical properties of the nerve is unknown. We have studied the retraction responses of the core and sheath following transection, together with their tensile properties and the interface between them. Nerves were harvested and maintained at their in situ tension and then either transected entirely, through the sheath only, or through an exposed section of the core. The retraction of each component was measured within 5 min and again after 45 min. Post mortem loss of <b>retraction</b> was <b>tested</b> 0 min or 60 min after excision. For fresh nerves, immediate retraction was 12. 68 % (whole nerve), 5. 35 % (sheath) and 4 % (core), with a total retraction of 15 %, 7. 21 % and 5. 26 % respectively. For stored nerves, immediate retraction was 5. 33 % (whole nerve) and 5. 87 % (sheath), with an extension of 0. 78 % for core, and a total retraction of 6. 71 % and 7. 87 % and an extension of 1. 74 %, respectively. Tensile extension and pullout force profiles were obtained for the sheath, the core and the interface between them. These showed a consistent hierarchy of break strengths that would, under increasing load, result in failure of the interface, then the core and finally the sheath. These data reflect the contributions of material tension and fluid swelling pressure to total retraction, and the involvement of an energy-dependent process that runs down rapidly post mortem.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{elucidate}} the early detachment of the Solitaire stent during mechanical thrombectomy, {{we tested the}} stent in vitro under various conditions and evaluated with microscopy. METHODS: A total of five stents were tested. Using a dynamic mechanical analysis machine, we calculated the tensile force needed for separation of the four stents from the pusher wire. Stent Nos 1 and 2 were tested without any prior manipulation. During the <b>retraction</b> <b>test,</b> no sheathing around the stent-wire junction was applied to stent No 1 whereas stent No 2 was partially covered with a sheath in accordance with instructions for use (IFU) recommendations. Stent No 3 was tested after deployment and retrieval were performed three times in an in vitro vascular replica with sheathing during retrieval. Stent No 4 was tested after one deployment and retrieval using the same replica as in stent No 3 without sheathing. In addition, forward pushing force was applied intentionally during retraction to induce excessive bending of the stent. Stent No 5 was pulled apart by both hands. After separation, stent tips and pusher wires were studied for all stents under the microscope. RESULTS: The tensile force needed for separation was about 6 N for stent Nos 1, 2, and 3, and about 4 N for stent No 4. All of the stents showed separation at the proximal marker, not at the detachment zone. CONCLUSIONS: Detachment of the Solitaire stent during thrombectomy can be due to separation around or inside the proximal marker. Adherence to the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s IFU of partial re-sheathing during retraction and not using the device {{for more than two}} passes might decrease the possibility of such device failure...|$|E

Among these are the lusteroid tube coagulation test (1 - 4), the silicone tube co-agulation test (5), the modified clot <b>retraction</b> <b>test</b> (6), the modified Lee-White clotting test, employ-ing three test tubes instead of one (7), the heparin retarded coagulation test of Waugh and Ruddick (8, 9), the heparin tolerance test (10, 11), and the prothrombin time determination, using both whole and dilute plasma (12 - 14). The study reported herewith was undertaken for the following purposes. First, it was desired to ascertain {{whether or not there is}} any correlation among the various tests themselves. Second, it was decided to determine whether any of these tests can be used to predict thrombophlebitis in patients. Finally, the incidence and duration of hypercoagu-lability in the postoperative state was studied, as well as the incidence of hypercoagulability in con-gestive heart failure. Incident to doing these stud-ies, observations were made on the effect of vari-ation of tube size and temperature upon the clot-ting time of blood in the Lee-White test. Further, in doing the heparin tolerance test, blood was withdrawn almost simultaneously from the vein into which the heparin was injected and from a vein of the opposite arm.

40|$|Human breast {{tumors are}} often {{associated}} with a fibrotic reaction termed desmoplasia. Tumor cells may indirectly modulate {{the composition of the}} extracellular matrix by influencing fibroblast properties. They may also directly interact with collagen fibrils leading to retraction of the matrix. We have studied in vitro the influence of various human mammary tumor cells on the proliferation rate of normal human fibroblasts and on their level of collagen synthesis, as well as their release of collagenase activity. Interactions between neoplastic cells and collagen matrix were investigated by incorporation of tumor cells in collagen gels (lattices) and measurement of their <b>retraction.</b> All cells <b>tested</b> (HBL 100, SW 613, SA 52, MDA-MB- 231, MCF 7, MCF 7 / 6, MCF 7 ras, BT 20 and T 47 D) were able to modulate the composition of the extracellular matrix by one or several of the mechanisms investigated. Our results also demonstrate an opposite regulation of collagen and collagenase production. The effects on the collagen metabolism and on fibroblast proliferation are probably mediated by soluble cytokines since they are reproduced by incubating the fibroblasts in the presence of medium conditioned by tumor cells. The desmoplastic reaction may thus result from different mechanisms dependent upon tumor cell types. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the patterns of pelvic rotational asymmetry in the transverse plane and identify the possible factors related to this problem. One thousand and forty-five patients with cerebral palsy (CP) and complete documentation in the gait laboratory were reviewed in a retrospective study. Pelvic asymmetry in the transverse plane was observed in 52. 7 % of the patients; and to identify the possible causes of pelvic <b>retraction,</b> clinical (Thomas <b>test,</b> popliteal angle, and gastrocnemius tightness) and dynamic parameters (mean rotation of the hip in stance, minimum hip flexion, minimum knee flexion, and peak ankle dorsiflexion) were evaluated. The association between these parameters and pelvic retraction was assessed statistically. The results showed that 75. 7 % of patients with asymmetric pattern of the pelvis had clinical diagnosis of diplegic spastic CP. Among the patients with asymmetrical CP, the most common pattern was pelvic retraction on the affected side. The relationship between pelvic retraction and internal hip rotation was stronger in patients with asymmetrical diplegic CP than in those with hemiplegic (P< 0. 001) or symmetrical diplegic CP (P= 0. 014). All of the patients exhibited a significant association among clinical parameters (Thomas test, popliteal angle, and gastrocnemius tightness) and pelvic retraction. In conclusion, pelvic retraction seems to be a multifactorial problem, and the etiology can change according to topographic classification, which must be taken into account during the decision-making process in patients with CP.

In this work, a porous electrode was fabricated and evaluated in a chronic animal study on a coronary venous pacing lead {{in order to}} assess its potential for mitigating chronic lead dislodgements and reducing the characteristic rise in pacing thresholds after implant, both of which being important issues that impact safety and efficacy of implanted cardiac resynchronization therapy systems. Eight test leads were assembled with a porous tip electrode with an average pore size of approximately 30 micrometers, created via a novel fabrication method, and eight control leads were assembled with a standard solid tip electrode design. Both groups were created without steroid-eluting collars and without a capacitive coating on the tip electrodes in order to isolate the affects of electrode porosity. Leads were implanted in canines, and electrical data and x-rays of lead position were taken regularly throughout the 60 -day study. Tissue histology was performed for each lead. Significantly lower (p< 0. 05) mean rise in pacing threshold after implant was observed at day 3 and day 21 for the test group leads (with porous electrodes) as compared to the control group leads. Despite the higher surface area of the porous tip electrodes, pacing impedance was not statistically different between the groups throughout the study, a result likely due to decreased chronic inflammatory response at the surface of porous electrodes. The test group had no lead retractions after day 3 as determined by inspection of x-ray radiographs, while 3 - 6 (of 8) control group leads retracted after day 3, a result likely due to anchoring of the lead tip due to observed tissue growth into porous electrodes. Mean fibrous capsule thickness at pre-defined measurement points on the tip electrode was not statistically different between the groups, which correlates with the nearly equal mean pacing thresholds for the groups at day 60. The lack of lead <b>retractions</b> for the <b>test</b> groups leads after day 3 is a promising result which should be investigated further, along with investigations of lead extraction force and further electrical data evaluations, using larger sample sizes and more challenging implant conditions...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this thesis}} was to improve outcome after tendon {{transfer}} and rotator cuff surgery by investigating the impact on response to passive mechanical testing and change in structural characteristics associated with longstanding changes in the tension of skeletal muscle in the human upper extremities in vivo. Patients and methods: The investigational method was in vitro assessment of human upper extremity muscles. Muscle biopsies were harvested from both healthy controls and patients with conditions representing different types of change in tension in the muscle-tendon unit; upper extremity muscles from patients with spastic contractures, subscapularis muscles from patients with residual internal rotation contractures of the shoulder following obstetric brachial plexus injury and supraspinatus muscles from patients with full thickness rotator cuff tears with <b>retraction.</b> Mechanical <b>testing</b> was performed by passively stretching single muscle fibres and muscle bundles, using the laser diffraction technique to measure changes in sarcomere length parallel to registrations of tension. Morphology was assessed using light microscopy and standard staining techniques, including immuno-assay. Results: I. The mechanical testing and fibre size of muscle biopsies from human upper extremities are unaffected by freeze storage at - 20 °C for up to four weeks. II. Stress relaxation after passive stretching follows a predictable regression pattern related, in amplitude and duration, to the measured sarcomere length after stretching. The time taken to reach a relatively stable tension plateau following the stretching of single fibres is two minutes or more in clinically relevant sarcomere lengths. III. The mechanical quality of the extracellular matrix in muscle bundles from patients with spastic contractures is compromised, resulting in impaired mechanical performance even though the actual muscle fibres are stiffer than normal controls. This indicates that compensatory mechanisms take place in both muscle and extracellular matrix. IV. The relative increase in the stiffness of the subscapularis muscle measured between single fibres and bundles is {{greater than that of}} normal controls, indicating a compensatory mechanism related to the extracellular matrix in children with obstetric brachial plexus palsy. V. The subscapularis muscle from children with residual internal rotation contracture following obstetric brachial plexus injury showed essentially normal muscle histology. This indicates that the longstanding loss of amplitude of the muscle secondary to the denervation of antagonist muscles is the most probable cause of internal rotation, at least in children without severe deformation of the glenohumeral joint. A direct injury to soft tissue at delivery and subsequent fibrosis might be a contributory factor. VI. The supraspinatus muscle from rotator cuff tears with a longstanding, significant retraction responds normally to passive mechanical testing in comparison to the healthy ipsilateral deltoid muscle, indicating that the overall stiffness in retracted rotator cuff tears is not primarily related to the mechanical or morphological deterioration of the muscle tissue. A reduction in absolute muscle volume through the loss of serially coupled sarcomeres is a possible explanation, although no evidence of the presence of this mechanism in humans has previously been demonstrated. Conclusions: To improve the outcome at tendon transfer surgery, assessments of the tension in the muscle-tendon unit to be transferred at surgery should preferably be made with a minimum of two minutes’ delay following stretching. Human upper extremity muscles are sensitive to changes in tension over time in different aspects. The spastic condition with deranged neural regulation, including irregular changes in tension, appears to have a profound impact on muscle fibres, as well as on extracellular matrix mechanics. The longstanding reduction in tension, as exemplified by the subscapularis muscle of shoulders with a persistent internal rotation following brachial plexus injury and the supraspinatus in retracted rotator cuff tears, appears to have only mild effects on muscle mechanics, but compensatory changes in the extracellular matrix can be detected, affecting the mechanical performance in the muscle-tendon unit as a whole. A possible feedback system sensitive to mechanical stimuli may involve both the direct mechanical interaction of intra- to extracellular proteins and indirect communication through the up- and down-regulation of the production of structural proteins...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityHemorrhagic {{disorders}} {{designated by}} the term "purpura" are usually associated {{with the appearance of}} petechiae, ecchymoses, and lowered platelet counts. However, the mechanism of bleeding and the etiology remain unsolved. The cheek pouch of the hamster was used in an attempt to determine the cause of the bleeding under two conditions: first, in experimental purpura produced by antiplatelet serum prepared by repeated injections of hamster platelets into rabbits, and second, following infusion with dextran. Peripheral blood counts, bone marrow examinations, coagulation tests, and special tests for vascular fragility and hemostatic function (negative pressure, snake venom, and microelectrode) have been applied to normal hamsters as a basis for interpretation in hemorrhagic diathesis. Microscopic observations were made in vivo and recorded on Kodachrome motion picture film by means of cinephotomicrographic equipment. The results of previous blood counts and bone marrow examinations have been confirmed and analyzed more critically. Detailed observations have been made on the morphology of the blood cells in the stained smear and reticulocyte counts have been reported {{for the first time in}} the hamster. The red cell count in the hamster (6. 8 ± 1. 2 million per cu. mm.) is slightly higher than that in man, and the reticulocyte value is also higher (2. 5 ± 1. 2 per cent). The polymorphonuclear and lymphocytic values were reversed in the hamster (polymorphs 30 ± 6 per cent, lymphocytes 61 ± 7. 5 per cent). The peripheral blood smear showed moderate polychromatophilia and occasional target cells. The bone marrow of the hamster was more cellular than that of man, with a ratio of white cells to red cells of 8 : 1. The coagulation tests were within limits comparable with those for man. Three in vivo tests for vascular fragility and hemostatic function in the hamster cheek pouch were utilized: namely, the moccasin venom test (Fulton, Lutz, Shulman, and Arendt, in press); the negative pressure test (Shulman, Mode, Kagan, and Fulton, Anat. Rec. 118 : 408, 1954); and the microelectrode test (Fulton, Akers, and Lutz. Blood 8 : 140, 1953). The snake venom test applied to the cheek pouch of the normal hamster produced 71 ± 6 petechiae at one hour intervals and 138 ± 20 at the end of two hours. The negative pressure test produced from 0 to 4 petechiae at one minute Nith a negative pressure of 20 mm of mercury. The microelectrode test was used to evaluate the fragility of blood vessels by stimulation of the wall with single faradic shocks. Vasoconstriction occurred at low voltages (threshold, 4 to 10 volt single shock) in muscular arterioles and venules. The sphincters were more sensitive than other portions of the vascular network. White cell sticking and platelet thrombosis occurred at higher voltages (10 to 3 O volts). The vessel wall of normal hamsters was resistant even to very high voltages (150 volts). If normal vessels were ruptured, the broken ends were sealed immediately, probably by "electrocoagulation". The results of the microelectrode test were compared in young and "old age" hamsters. No significant differences were obtained except for an increase in white cell adhesiveness in the "old age" group. Hamsters of either sex and 75 to 100 grams in weight were splenectomized. The platelet counts increased daily for 4 to 6 days after splenectomy and gradually returned to normal on the 14 th to 18 th day. The smear of peripheral blood exhibited increased polychromatophilia, target cells, and clumps of platelets, particularly on the 4 th to 8 th day. Howell-Jolly bodies were absent. Changes in the bone marrow were not remarkable. The microelectrode test for thrombus susceptibility revealed a marked tendency for thrombosis, while the fragility threshold did not differ from that in normal hamsters. Experimental thrombocytopenic purpura in hamsters, caused by injection of antiplatelet serum, produced spontaneous purpura, ecchymoses and bleeding manifestations in the cheek pouch and in almost all organs of the body. The platelet counts were decreased and the bone marrow showed immature-like amorphic megakaryocytes. Bleeding times and clot retraction determinations were abnormal. Values for the bleeding time in excess of 240 seconds v-rere not uncommon (normal bleading time, 109 ± 19). The snake venom test produced profuse numbers of petechiae within one half hour. Stimulation of the blood vessel wall with low voltage produced platelet thrombi in normal hamsters. In thrombocytopenic hamsters, thrombus formation and leukocytic sticking did not occur even with high voltages. However, the vessel walls were fragile and rupture occurred at electric thresholds lower than 150 volts (60 to 140). These changes were more marked at 24 hours after treatment with antiplatelet serum than at two hours. Small repeated injections of antiplatelet serum produced similar results. In control experiments, hamsters were injected with serum obtained from normal rabbits and with saline solution. The test procedures showed no appreciable deviations from normal values. The fragility thresholds were normal. The splenectomized hamsters with elevated platelet counts were given antipletelet serum. The fragility threshold to electrical stimulation of the vessel wall was lowered and hemorrhage occurred at low voltages. Consequently, splenectomy and the concomitant increase in numbers of circulating platelets shed no protective effect in experimental purpura. Recently, detrimental reactions to plasma substitutes have been critically evaluated and the dextrans have been reported to cause a hemostatic defect in human beings. Dextran increased the bleeding time in normal volunteers as well as in patients with shock. The exact nature of the bleeding phenomenon has not been determined. The precise techniques available for the study of hemorrhage in the hamster cheek pouch have been used to evaluate the hemostatic defect caused by dextran and to observe in vivo the changes occurring in the formed elements of the blood end in the characteristics of the vessel wall. Hematological changes in the hamster after infusion with dextran were insignificant except for the effects of hemodilution and the clumping of platelets. The results of the various coagulation tests (clotting time, prothrombin time, clot <b>retraction,</b> and fibrinolysis <b>test)</b> were within normallimits. The bleeding time was prolonged significantly as shown by values of more than 240 seconds as compared with values of 109 ± 19 seconds in normal hamsters. All dextrans used in this study (Lares, Cutter) produced an increased bleeding time except Expandex. The Lares dextran seemed to be more detrimental than other types. After injection of Lares, increased numbers of leukocytes were adherent to the endothelium at 24 hours and during a period of 3 to 4 weeks. The thrombosis threshold was increased. The formation, canalization, and embolization of thrombi were recorded on Kodachrome motion picture film. The frag ility threshold, as tested with microelectrode and also snake venom, was lowered. The vascular defect was greater with Lares than with other dextrans. In conclusion, experimental purpura was produced in hamsters by antiplatelet serwn for the first time. The resultant bleeding phenomenon and hemostatic defect was related to lowered platelet counts and decreased frag ility of the vessel wall. Splenectomy accompanied by increased platelet counts was not remedial. The effects of dextran infusions in hamsters have been critically evaluated by routine hematological tests and by special tests for vascular fragility and hemostatic function. A defect in the vessel wall was shown by the lowered fragility to faradic stimulation. This finding provided the basis for a new explanation for the hemostatic defect, namely, damage to the vessel wall. This is in addition to the previously known factors of prolonged bleeding time and unexplained clumping of the platelets...|$|R
