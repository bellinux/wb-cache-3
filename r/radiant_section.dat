The unit uses self recuperative FLOX ® burners arranged in a “nozzle field ” and is designed to preheat the strip up to 400 °C. The required heating length is reduced to one fourth of a comparable <b>radiant</b> tube furnace <b>section.</b> This implies a large reduction in specific furnace length and therefore in lay-out and investment costs.

40|$|Most of the {{available}} computational models for Selective Non- Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) systems are capable of identifying injection parameters such as spray droplet size, injection angles and velocity. These results allow identification of the appropriate injection locations based on the temperature window and mixing for effective dispersion of the reagent. However, in order to quantify No{sub x} reduction and estimate the potential for ammonia slip, a kinetic model must be coupled with the mixing predictions. Typically, reaction mechanisms for SNCR consist of over 100 elementary steps occurring between approximately 30 different species. Trying to model a mechanism of this size is not practical. This ABB project incorporated development of SNCR systems including NO{sub x} reduction and ammonia slip. The model was validated using data collected from a large-scale experimental test facility. The model developed under this project can be utilized for the SNCR system design applicable to HIPPS. The HITAF design in the HIPPS project includes low NO{sub x} firing system in the coal combustor and both selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) downstream of the <b>radiant</b> heating <b>section</b> and selective catalytic reduction in a lower temperature zone. The performance of the SNCR will dictate the capacity and capital cost requirements of the SCR...|$|R
50|$|The {{convection}} section is located above the <b>radiant</b> <b>section</b> {{where it is}} cooler to recover additional heat. Heat transfer takes place by convection here, and the tubes are finned to increase heat transfer. The first two tube rows {{in the bottom of}} the {{convection section}} and at the top of the <b>radiant</b> <b>section</b> is an area of bare tubes (without fins) and are known as the shield section ("shock tubes"), so named because they are still exposed to plenty of radiation from the firebox and they also act to shield the convection section tubes, which are normally of less resistant material from the high temperatures in the firebox.|$|E
50|$|The tubes, shown below, {{which are}} reddish brown from corrosion, are carbon steel tubes {{and run the}} height of the <b>radiant</b> <b>section.</b> The tubes are a {{distance}} away from the insulation so radiation can be reflected {{to the back of the}} tubes to maintain a uniform tube wall temperature.

50|$|Sootblowers {{are found}} in the {{convection}} section. As this section is above the <b>radiant</b> <b>section</b> and air movement is slower because of the fins, soot tends to accumulate here. Sootblowing is normally done when the efficiency of the convection section is decreased. This can be calculated by looking at the temperature change from the crossover piping and at the convection section exit.|$|E
40|$|Developments {{over the}} past fifteen years have evolved new short flame, high {{intensity}} (1, 000, 000 BTU/HR/ft 3) combustion systems for industrial uses. Such systems produce a more uniform and higher heat flux than conventional low intensity systems and should enable substantial capital cost savings in new furnace applications. Recent performance improvements established from tests of high intensity combustion systems are described along with advances made in the analytical prediction of design performance. High intensity combustion systems can operate at zero excess air conditions without generating undesirable constituents in the exhaust. A more uniform gas temperature and gas emissivity renders modeling and design of the furnace <b>radiant</b> heat transfer <b>section</b> more realistic. 'Over-design' to allow for the less determinate conditions typical of low intensity, turbulent diffusion oil flame systems should be avoidable. A model has been set up and results generated which indicate the potentialities of the above premise. The application of vortex stabilized high intensity burners for reformer furnaces in the petrochemical industry is then reviewed and emphasized...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{transfer}} at the nanoscale {{is crucial}} for robust and novel nanomanufacturing applications. The mechanisms by which heat can be transported to and from nano-sized mechanical systems are currently comprehended through solutions to Maxwell’s equations; analytically this is a complex and weighty task [1]. Equally, optical and thermal phenomena {{that occur in the}} nanoscale regime are challenging. In order to gain a clearer understanding of absorption by nanosized particles on or near substrates we have studied the effect of particles size (10 - 80 nm in diameter) and the effect of a probe (gold, silver or silicon). To assess the scale and importance of these interactions, and to increase the depth of knowledge of nanoscale physics, we have performed numerical analysis of the optical absorption of nanoparticles. The results presented are a portion of the theoretical framework of nanoscale interactions and fusing [2, 3] which is currently being experimentally verified. The absorption of resonating particles of different sizes, between 10 and 80 nm, are modeled. The extinction cross <b>sections,</b> <b>radiant</b> flux scattered and absorbed by the particle and the extinction efficiency can be used to determine resonance wavelengths [4]. Using the dipole approximation, one can determine the extinction cross-section resonance [5, 6], which {{can be used as a}} litmus test for th...|$|R
40|$|Reaction Engineering International (REI) {{managed a}} team of experts from University of Utah, Siemens Energy, Praxair, Vattenfall AB, Sandia National Laboratories, Brigham Young University (BYU) and Corrosion Management Ltd. to perform multi-scale experiments, coupled with {{mechanism}} development, process modeling and CFD modeling, for both applied and fundamental investigations. The primary objective of this program was to acquire data and develop tools to characterize and predict impacts of CO{sub 2 } flue gas recycle and burner feed design on flame characteristics (burnout, NO{sub x}, SO{sub x}, mercury and fine particle emissions, heat transfer) and operational concerns (fouling, slagging and corrosion) inherent in the retrofit of existing coal-fired boilers for oxy-coal combustion. Experimental work was conducted at Sandia National Laboratories’ Entrained Flow Reactor, the University of Utah Industrial Combustion Research Facility, and Brigham Young University. Process modeling and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling was performed at REI. Successful completion of the project objectives resulted in the following key deliverables: 1) Multi-scale test data from 0. 1 kW bench-scale, 100 kW and 200 kW laboratory-scale, and 1 MW semi-industrial scale combustors that describe differences in flame characteristics, fouling, slagging and corrosion for coal combustion under air-firing and oxygen-firing conditions, including sensitivity to oxy-burner design and flue gas recycle composition. 2) Validated mechanisms developed from test data that describe fouling, slagging, waterwall corrosion, heat transfer, char burnout and sooting under coal oxy-combustion conditions. The mechanisms were presented in a form suitable for inclusion in CFD models or process models. 3) Principles to guide design of pilot-scale and full-scale coal oxy-firing systems and flue gas recycle configurations, such that boiler operational impacts from oxy-combustion retrofits are minimized. 4) Assessment of oxy-combustion impacts in two full-scale coal-fired utility boiler retrofits based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of air-fired and oxygen-fired operation. This research determined that it is technically feasible to retrofit the combustion system in an air-fired boiler for oxy-fired operation. The impacts of CO{sub 2 } flue gas recycle and burner design on flame characteristics (burnout, NO{sub x}, SO{sub x}, mercury and fine particle emissions, heat transfer) and operational concerns (fouling, slagging and corrosion) were minimal, {{with the exception of}} high sulfur levels resulting from untreated flue gas recycle with medium and high-sulfur coals. This work focused on combustion in the <b>radiant</b> and convective <b>sections</b> of the boiler and did not address boiler system integration issues, plant efficiencies, impacts on downstream air pollution control devices, or CO{sub 2 } capture and compression. The experimental data, oxy-firing system principles and oxy-combustion process mechanisms provided by this work can be used by electric utilities, boiler OEMs, equipment suppliers, design firms, software vendors, consultants and government agencies to assess retrofit applications of oxy-combustion technologies to existing boilers and to guide development of new designs...|$|R

The flames heat up the tubes, which in turn heat the fluid inside {{in the first part of}} the furnace known as the <b>radiant</b> <b>section</b> or firebox.

40|$|The {{continuing}} {{growth in}} the importance of oil and gas production and processing overall the globe increase the need for accurate prediction of various parameters and their impact on unit operations, process simulation and design. Because of the particular nature of various parameters, sometimes existing methods encounter difficulties. Currently several models are available to predict various design parameters in the oil and gas processing industries. However, their calculations may require rigorous computer solutions. Therefore, developing the new predictive tools to which are easier than the existing methods, less complicated with fewer computations to minimize the complex and time-consuming calculation steps is an essential need. It is apparent that mathematically compact, simple, and reasonably accurate predictive tools, as proposed in this thesis, would be preferable for computationally intensive simulations. In fact, the development of engineering correlations by a modification to the well-known Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) [1921 - 1926] equation and Arrhenius equation (1889) was the primary motivation of the present thesis, which, nevertheless, yielded predictive tools with accuracy comparable to that of the existing rigorous simulations. Hence, some existing approaches lead to complicated equations for the purposes of engineering importance. This problem has been circumvented conveniently by resorting to simpler approaches, as described in this thesis. The purpose of the proposed Dissertation work is to develop and formulate accurate and reliable predictive tools to serve two purposes. First, being conversion of a set of highly correlated variables to a set of independent variables by using linear transformations. Second one is for variable reductions. When a dependent variable is specified, the method is very efficient for dimensional reduction due to the supervised nature of its methodology. The developed tools in this study can be immense engineering value to predict different process design parameters, including the prediction of hydrate forming conditions of natural gases, hydrate forming pressure of pure alkanes in the presence of inhibitors, water-hydrocarbon systems mutual solubilities, water content of natural gas, density, thermal conductivity and viscosity of aqueous glycol solutions, optimum size of inlet scrubber and contactor in natural gas dehydration systems, estimation of water-adsorption isotherms, estimation of equilibrium water dew point of natural gas in triethylene glycol dehydration systems, true vapour pressure (TVP) of LPG and natural gasoline, hydrocarbon components solubilities in hydrate inhibitors, methanol vaporization loss and solubility in hydrocarbon liquid phase for gas hydrate inhibition, storage pressure of gasoline in uninsulated tanks, emissivity of combustion gases, filling losses from storage containers,bulk modulus and volumetric expansion coefficient of water for leak tightness test of pipelines, silica solubility and carry-over in steam, carbon dioxide equilibrium adsorption isotherms, estimation of packed column size, estimation of thermal insulation thickness, transport properties of carbon dioxide, aqueous solubility of light hydrocarbons, estimation of economic thermal insulation thickness, water content of air at elevated pressures, surface tension of paraffin hydrocarbons, aqueous solubility and density of carbon dioxide, aqueous solubility of light hydrocarbons, thermal conductivity of hydrocarbons, downcomer design velocity and vapour capacity correction factor in fractionators, estimation of convection heat transfer coefficients and efficiencies for finned tubular sections, estimation of heat losses from process piping and equipment surfaces, prediction of absorption/stripping factors, correlating theoretical stages and operating reflux in fractionators, design of <b>radiant</b> and convective <b>sections</b> of direct fired heaters and many other engineering parameters. Following the development of predictive tools, experimental work was undertaken to measure the density and viscosity, of ethylene glycol + water, diethylene glycol + water, and triethylene glycol + water mixtures at temperatures ranging from 290 K to 440 K and concentrations ranging from 20 mol % glycol to 100 mol % glycol. Our data were correlated using a novel Arrhenius-type equation based predictive tool and a thermodynamical method (the generalized corresponding states principle (GCSP)). Both novel Arrhenius-type equation based predictive tool and GCSP method, with two adjustable parameters for each property, offer the potential for judicious extrapolation of density and viscosity data for all glycol + water mixtures. In addition, in this thesis, the PreTOG software package has been developed, which covers a wide range of parameters in oil, gas and chemical processing industries and is using PC-based Windows and Matlab graphical user interfaces and tool boxes. The PreTOG software is also available on an stand-alone CD. Finally the following typical case studies for potential benefits to various processing plants industries will be presented and the results of new proposed model are compared with partial least squares (PLS) and principal component analysis (PCA) : •Methanol vaporization loss during gas hydrate inhibition •Methanol loss in condensate liquid phase during gas hydrate inhibition •Estimation of potential savings from reducing unburned combustible losses in coal-fired systems •Recoverable heat from blowdown systems during steam generation •Energy conservation benefits in excess air controlled gas-fired systems •Prediction of salinity of salty crude oi...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{practicality}} {{of using a}} liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurry preparation and feed system for the E-Gas™ gasifier in an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) electric power generation plant configuration. Liquid CO{sub 2 } has several property differences from water that make it attractive for the coal slurries used in coal gasification-based power plants. First, the viscosity of liquid CO{sub 2 } is much lower than water. This means it should take less energy to pump liquid CO{sub 2 } through a pipe compared to water. This also means that a higher solids concentration can be fed to the gasifier, which should decrease the heat requirement needed to vaporize the slurry. Second, the heat of vaporization of liquid CO{sub 2 } is about 80 % lower than water. This means that less heat from the gasification reactions is needed to vaporize the slurry. This should result in less oxygen needed to achieve a given gasifier temperature. And third, the surface tension of liquid CO{sub 2 } is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than water, which should result in finer atomization of the liquid CO{sub 2 } slurry, faster reaction times between the oxygen and coal particles, and better carbon conversion at the same gasifier temperature. EPRI and others have recognized the potential that liquid CO{sub 2 } has in improving the performance of an IGCC plant and have previously conducted systemslevel analyses to evaluate this concept. These {{past studies have shown}} that a significant increase in IGCC performance can be achieved with liquid CO{sub 2 } over water with certain gasifiers. Although these previous analyses had produced some positive results, they were still based on various assumptions for liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurry properties. This low-rank coal study extends the existing knowledge base to evaluate the liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurry concept on an E-Gas™-based IGCC plant with full 90 % CO{sub 2 } capture. The overall objective is to determine if this technology could be used to reduce the cost and improve the efficiency of IGCC plants. The study goes beyond the systems-level analyses and initial lab work that formed the bases of previous studies and includes the following tasks: performing laboratory tests to quantify slurry properties; developing an engineering design of a liquid CO{sub 2 } slurry preparation and feed system; conducting a full IGCC plant techno-economic analysis for Powder River Basin (PRB) coal and North Dakota lignite in both water and liquid CO{sub 2 } slurries; and identifying a technology development plan to continue the due diligence to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of this technology. The initial task included rheology tests and slurry data analyses that would increase the knowledge and understanding of maximum solids loading capability for both PRB and lignite. Higher coal concentrations have been verified in liquid CO{sub 2 } over water slurries, and a coal concentration of 75 % by weight in liquid CO{sub 2 } has been estimated to be achievable in a commercial application. In addition, lower slurry viscosities have been verified in liquid CO{sub 2 } at the same solids loading, where the liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurry viscosity has been measured to be about a factor of 10 lower than the comparable water slurry and estimated to be less than 100 centipoise in a commercial application. In the following task, an engineering design of a liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurry preparation and mixing system has been developed for both a batch and continuous system. The capital cost of the design has also been estimated so that it could be used in the economic analysis. An industry search and survey has been conducted to determine if essential components required to construct the feed system are available from commercial sources or if targeted R&D efforts are required. The search and survey concluded that commercial sources are available for selected components that comprise both the batch and continuous type systems. During normal operation, the fuel exits the bottom of the coal silo and is fed to a rod mill for grinding to the desired particle size. From the rod mill, the coal is transported in a dense phase pneumatic transport system {{to the top of a}} solids heat exchanger, wherein the ground coal is chilled to a low temperature (in the range of - 23. 3 °C (- 10 °F)) prior to mixing with liquid CO{sub 2 }. This temperature was selected based on evaluating trade-offs between refrigeration work and the cost of the system pressure boundary at various combinations of pressure and temperature that correspond to the gas/liquid phase boundary for CO{sub 2 }. Electrical loads to drive the equipment comprising the liquid CO{sub 2 } feed system are significantly greater than those for a water slurry system, and this effect has been captured in the technical performance analysis. In the next task, a plant-wide techno-economic analysis has been conducted for PRB coal and lignite in both liquid CO{sub 2 } and water slurry feed. The IGCC cases using a liquid CO{sub 2 } slurry system show reduced plant output and higher heat rate for PRB coal and for ND lignite at 90 % CO{sub 2 } capture. Some of these performance differences can be attributed to the higher requirement for steam for the liquid CO{sub 2 } slurry cases to drive the water-gas shift reaction, thereby reducing steam turbine power generation. Other factors contributing to the calculated performance differences are the increase in parasitic loads attributable to refrigeration to produce liquid CO{sub 2 } and chilled coal and the reduction in enthalpy of the inlet streams to the gasifier associated with the low temperature liquid CO{sub 2 } slurry feed. The capital costs for the complete plant are slightly higher for the liquid CO{sub 2 } slurry cases for PRB coal but somewhat reduced for ND lignite relative to the corresponding water slurry cases. Differences in dollar/kWe costs are higher for both coals due to the reduction in net output. The cost of electricity computed for the liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurry cases is greater for both PRB and ND Lignite coals. It does not appear that there is any benefit to using liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurries for feeding low rank coals to the E-Gas™ gasifier. Any incidental benefits in improved cold gas efficiency are more than compensated for in higher overall plant costs, increased complexity, and reduced power output and efficiency. The results of the study are compared with previous published analyses, and the differences in model assumptions, approach and basis are summarized. It has been concluded that the use of liquid CO{sub 2 } may still prove to have a significant advantage in a different type of gasifier, i. e., single-stage entrained flow with <b>radiant</b> quench <b>section,</b> but some key questions remain unanswered that can validate the potential improvement of gasifier performance using liquid CO{sub 2 } slurries. In order to provide a path to answering these questions, a technology development roadmap has been developed to resolve fundamental issues and to better define the operation aspects of using liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurries. The fundamental issues could be resolved by conducting additional laboratory analyses consisting of: • A rheological test program to quantitatively evaluate slurry preparation and handling for liquid CO{sub 2 } including experiments to evaluate preparation systems. • An experimental program on CO{sub 2 }-assisted gasification in order to obtain the most relevant experimental data from drop tube furnace studies to aid in verifying the potential advantages of direct feed of liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal as gasifier feedstocks. Quantifying the operational aspects of liquid CO{sub 2 } slurries can best be achieved with: • An experimental program using a flow test loop to evaluate equipment performance and handling properties of liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurries for gasifier feedstocks on a scale sufficient to predict full scale operating parameters. • Spray atomization studies necessary to evaluate the effect of atomization properties of liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurries that could be significantly different than those of water/coal slurries...|$|R

The aim {{of the current study}} is to formulate simple-to-use correlations to design the radiant and convective sections of direct fired heaters. The developed tools are easier than currently available models and involves a fewer number of parameters, requiring less complicated and shorter computations. Firstly, a simple correlation is developed to provide an accurate and rapid prediction of the absorbed heat in the <b>radiant</b> <b>section</b> of a fired heater, expressed as a fraction of the total net heat liberation, in terms of the average heat flux to the tubes, the arrangement of the tubes (circumferential), and the air to fuel mass ratio. Secondly, another simple correlation is developed to approximate external heat transfer coefficients for 75, 100, and 150 Â mm nominal pipe size (NPS) steel pipes arranged in staggered rows and surrounded by combustion gases. Finally, a simple correlation is presented to predict the gross thermal efficiency as a function of percent excess air and stack gas temperature. This study shows that the proposed method has a good agreement with the available reliable data in the literature. The average absolute deviations between reported data and the proposed correlations are found to be around 1. 5 % demonstrating the excellent performance of proposed predictive tool. The proposed simple-to-use method can be of significant practical value for the engineers and scientists to have a quick check on the design of radiant and convective sections of direct fired heater.
