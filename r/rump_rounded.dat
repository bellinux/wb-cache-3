5000|$|I {{walked on}} shore {{to find an}} old Vulcanoe ... in my walk I killed a Buck Goat of this Countrey, about {{the height of the}} Grown Deer, its body Shorter the horns which is not very hard and forks [...] up one prong Short the other round & Sharp arched, and is {{immediately}} above its Eyes the Colour is a light gray with black behind its ears down the neck, and its face white round its neck, its Sides and its <b>rump</b> <b>round</b> its tail which is Short & white; Verry actively made, has only a pair of hoofs to each foot, his brains {{on the back of his}} head, his Nostrals large, his eyes like a Sheep he is more like the Antilope or Gazelle of Africa than any other Species of Goat.|$|R
5000|$|The base steak {{from which}} the popeseye steak is cut is the <b>Rump</b> steak or <b>Round</b> Steak, which {{consists}} of the [...] "eye round, bottom round, and top round still connected together".|$|R
5000|$|Picanha is {{a cut of}} beef called sirloin cap in the U.S. that {{is popular}} in Brazil. In the U.S. it is little known, but {{referred}} to as the rump cover, rump cap or coulotte. North American butchers generally divide it into other cuts like the <b>rump,</b> the <b>round</b> and the loin. In some places in the US it is called top sirloin cap.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the obvious differences in color, the gray brocket is generally smaller than the red brocket. Separation of the gray brocket and the Amazonian brown brocket using external features is far harder, but the former has a more orange <b>rump,</b> bigger, more <b>rounded</b> ears, wider auditory bullae, and smaller eyes.|$|R
500|$|How {{the animals}} {{came to be}} called [...] "pigs" [...] is not clear. They are built {{somewhat}} like pigs, with large heads relative to their bodies, stout necks, and <b>rounded</b> <b>rumps</b> with no tail of any consequence; some of the sounds they emit are very similar to those made by pigs, and they also spend a large amount of time eating. They can survive for long periods in small quarters, like a 'pig pen', and were thus easily transported on ships to Europe.|$|R
50|$|Tafelspitz is the Austrian name of {{the meat}} cut which is used, usually from a young ox. This cut is {{typically}} known in the United States as the Standing <b>Rump</b> or Top <b>Round,</b> depending on the nomenclature of cuts used. The British cut would be called Topside. It is the top hind end of the cattle where the tail originates. Alternatively, a similar cut of beef from a young ox, properly hung, with firm white fat (not yellow). The fat can be left on to prevent the meat from becoming dry.|$|R
50|$|The Abyssinian Sand Terrier's head {{is broad}} in the skull with a long, tapered muzzle. The eyes are medium and almond shaped, {{but do not}} bulge. Their ears are either rose shaped or large and bat like; both are very thin in texture. The nose is usually black, but many Abyssinian Sand Terriers have a nose {{that is the same}} color as their coat. Their bite is scissor or level. The neck is arched {{slightly}} and gets thicker the closer it gets to the shoulders. The Abyssinian Sand Terrier has a very deep and broad chest, with the depth reaching the elbows. This breed has a level back and a <b>round</b> <b>rump.</b> The tail is low set and tapers to a fine point. This dog has a good reach in its gait and is very well balanced. Abyssinian Sand Terriers are fearless, loyal, and willing to please.|$|R
500|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{has a strong}} and well {{developed}} neck and forequarters, but relatively underdeveloped hindquarters. The <b>rump</b> is <b>rounded</b> rather than angular, which prevents attackers coming from behind from getting {{a firm grip on}} it. The head is wide and flat with a blunt muzzle and broad rhinarium. In contrast to the striped hyena, the ears of the spotted hyena are rounded rather than pointed. Each foot has four digits, which are webbed and armed with short, stout and blunt claws. The paw-pads are broad and very flat, with the whole undersurface of the foot around them being naked. The tail is relatively short, being [...] long, and resembles a pompom in appearance. Unusually among hyaenids, and mammals in general, the female spotted hyena is considerably larger than the male. Both sexes have a pair of anal glands which open into the rectum just inside the anal opening. These glands produce a white, creamy secretion which is pasted onto grass stalks by everting the rectum. The odour of this secretion is very strong, smelling of boiling cheap soap or burning, and can be detected by humans several metres downwind. The spotted hyena has a proportionately large heart, constituting close to 1% of its body weight, thus giving it great endurance in long chases. In contrast, a lion's heart makes up only 0.45–0.57 percent of its body weight. The now extinct Eurasian populations were distinguished from the modern African populations by their shorter distal extremities and longer humerus and femur.|$|R
5000|$|Spanish Mustang stands from [...] in height, {{with horses}} over 15 hands not favored. They weigh between 650 and 1100 lb. They are smooth muscled with short backs, <b>rounded</b> <b>rumps</b> and low-set tails. The {{coupling}} {{is strong and}} horses are to be well balanced and smoothly built with an [...] "uphill" [...] build. The girth is deep, with a well laid back shoulder and fairly pronounced withers. They possess a straight or concave facial profile and wide foreheads. Necks are fairly well crested in mares and geldings and heavily crested in mature stallions. Chests are moderately narrow but well-defined. Chestnuts are small or missing altogether, particularly on the rear legs. Ergots are small or absent. Feet are round and hard and legs are to be of correct conformation, though hind legs may be set under a bit. Cannons are short and bone is rounded. Some individuals are gaited, {{with a range of}} different footfalls accepted. Paddling or winging out are not a fault unless there is interference or it is caused by a lack of straightness in the leg.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in order to assess {{commercial}} front and rear cuts of dairy-origin cattle fed mesquite pod meal. Twenty-five non-castrated male bovines (Holstein-Zebu), distributed according to a completely randomized design, with five animals per treatment, were used. The feed contained about 121. 2 and 544. 98 g kg- 1 of crude protein and total digestible nutrients, respectively, and was composed of tifton grass hay, cornmeal, soybean meal, mesquite pod meal and mineral salt. The right half carcass of each animal was separated between the 5 th and 6 th ribs, in front and rear quarters, from which commercial cuts were obtained. There was no effect (p > 0. 05) as to the replacement of corn for mesquite pod meal on the weights and yields of front cuts (shoulder, brisket, chuck, hump and flanks) and rear cuts (tenderloin, shank, knuckle, thin flank, flat, eye <b>round,</b> <b>rump</b> tail, top side, cap of rump, rump, cut of rump, striploin, cap of cube roll). Mesquite pod meal can substitute cornmeal in 100 % in the concentrate without changes in weight and yield of the commercial front and rear cuts of male bovines of dairy origin...|$|R

Thigh convex.Color: Chestnut Retinta the bull, more or less dark brown, with clusters of pigmented centrifugal tendency in bulls and cows.Format: animals are harmonious, lively but docile temperament, large size and compact form, the respiratory tract (mainly the girth instead of waist circumference).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, weight, carcass dressing, weights of {{the primary}} cuts, weights of the {{physical}} components {{of the primary}} cuts, and weights of the main commercial cuts of 66 Purunã animals, of which 33 were bulls and 33 were steers were evaluated. These animals, {{with an average age}} of 19 months {{at the beginning of the}} experiment, were finished in a feedlot system during 116 days, and were fed with diets containing three levels of concentrate (0. 8 %, 1. 1 %, and 1. 4 % of body weight). The concentrate was formulated with 25 % soybean meal, 73 % ground corn grain, 1 % of a mineral mix, and 1 % of limestone. The interaction between sexual groups and the concentrate level was not significant for any of the variables. Likewise, no effect of the concentrate level was detected on the same variable traits. The bulls demonstrated higher hot carcass weights (265. 1 vs 221. 7 kg) and a higher proportion of forequarter (38. 4 % vs 36. 1 %) however the steers presented with higher proportions of side (19. 7 % vs 18. 5 %) and hindquarter (44. 2 % vs 43. 1 %). The bulls produced higher yields of muscle in the three primary cuts, there by resulting in higher yields of edible portions of the carcass. The bulls also produced higher weights of tenderloin, knuckle, topside, flat, eye <b>round,</b> <b>rump,</b> and rump cover. The finishing of young bulls in feedlot is to be recommended, since the animals produce carcasses with higher amounts of edible meat and higher yields of commercial cuts, thus allowing for a better price for the carcass. Low concentrate level could be used due to the lower cost of production for farmers...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine {{the relationship between the}} ratio of the bones and valuable meat preparates to the carcass, the age and the sex parameters in Holstein and Swiss Braun race cattle which are widely breaded in our country. The half and quarter carcasses of the cattle that are slaughtered in Istanbul were used as working material. The carcasses were separated into 4 groups as above 3 years of age group (n= 24), under 3 years of age group (n= 46), male group (n= 53) and female group (n= 17). Totally 140 carcasses were evaluated. According to the obtained results, hind quarter weight, fillet, loin, <b>rump,</b> tranche, sirloin, <b>round,</b> flank, shank, brisket, fore loin, sticking, chuck and total bones parameters were significantly different at (p< 0. 001) level between above the 3 years of age and under the 3 years of age group. Between the same groups the sirloin tip parameter was significantly different at p< 0. 01 level. At the parameters of leg weight, shank and half carcasses {{there was no significant difference}} between the groups. We could not determine any significant differences in the percentage ratio of all meat parameters to the carcass between the groups of above 3 years of age and under 3 years of age. In the male and female groups, all the parameters except loin, leg weight and shank were significantly different between the 2 groups. Hind quarter and shank parameters were significantly different at p< 0. 05 level, round parameter was significantly different at p< 0. 01 level, and the other valuable meat propagates were significantly different at p< 0. 001 level. Rump parameter was evaluated as significantly different at p< 0. 05 level between male and female groups. The other parameters were not significantly different between the mentioned groups...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the live weight (LW), morphological and testicular measures and their correlations in 31 Mediterranean buffaloes at three ages. We used seven animals at 8 {{months of age}} (T 1), 13 animals {{at the age of}} 10 months (T 2), and 11 animals at the age of 12 months (T 3) coming from a farm of the Coastal Lowlands of Rio de Janeiro. The following morphometric measurements and testes were evaluated: rump height (RH), withers height (WH), <b>rump</b> length (RL), <b>round</b> thickness (RT), scrotal circumference (SC), testicular length (TL), testicular width (TW). Testicular volume (TV) and body mass index (BMI) were also calculated. The testicular form was determined by the ratio between the TW and TL. We found the following means for the variables LW (240. 57 ± 18. 36; 259. 38 ± 28. 66; and 331. 82 ± 63. 23), WH (113. 28 ± 2. 44; 116. 23 ± 4. 74; and 121. 45 ± 6. 95 cm), RH (116. 07 ± 3. 09; 117. 54 ± 4. 97; and 125. 45 ± 6. 92 cm), RL (34. 86 ± 2. 03; 36. 35 ± 2. 80; and 38. 09 ± 3. 24 cm), RT (39. 07 ± 2. 22; 40 ± 2. 37; and 42. 91 ± 3. 97 cm), BMI (187. 37 ± 11. 45; 191. 69 ± 14. 61; and 222. 39 ± 23. 57) regarding the treatments T 1, T 2, and T 3, respectively. We found the following means for the variables SC (17. 43 ± 1. 81; 19. 08 ± 1. 98; and 22. 11 ± 3. 25 cm), TL (8. 28 ± 0. 99; 9. 27 ± 1. 33; and 10. 68 ± 1. 47 cm), TW (3. 25 ± 0. 25; 3. 90 ± 0. 58; and 4. 66 ± 0. 80 cm), and TV (109. 43 ± 24. 93; 198. 36 ± 87. 08; and 343. 83 ± 183. 04 cm 3) regarding the treatments T 1, T 2, and T 3, respectively. The predominant form in all treatments was long. There was no difference between the T 1 and T 2 for the studied variables. T 3 had higher averages for LW, BMI, RH, SC, TV, and TW. For the variables WH, RL, TL, and RT {{there was no difference between}} T 2 and T 3. There was a correlation between measurements and testicular measures WH, RH, and RL and between SC and TV, TL, and TW. Keywords: body measures; buffaloes; testicular measures...|$|R
