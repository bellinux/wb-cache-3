40|$|Abstract: In {{multi-rate}} wireless mesh networks, a mesh node can dynamically {{modify the}} data rate {{on a particular}} link, {{in response to the}} perceived SNR ratio between neighbor nodes. In such networks, existing route selection schemes use a link quality metric based on the expected amount of medium time it takes to successfully transmit a packet. However, these schemes do {{not take into account the}} status of network load. Therefore, they may easily result in the network being overloaded. In addition, the application has no way of improving its performance under given network traffic conditions. In this paper, a new <b>route</b> <b>metric</b> that considers both per-hop service delay, estimated using the number of packets waiting for transmission in the output queue at relay nodes, and link quality is proposed. In addition, we propose the network load-aware AODV (NLA-AODV) protocol using the proposed metric. This protocol is implemented in a straightforward manner. The performance evaluation is performed by simulation using OPNET. It is demonstrated that the performance of the routing protocol using the proposed <b>route</b> <b>metric</b> outperforms routing protocols using other existing route metrics in multi-rate wireless mesh networks. ...|$|E

The communication-aware route selection incorporates the routing decisions with knowledge of communication links including noise, path loss, multipath fading, and interference. We show how end-to-end throughput of route depends {{on the quality of}} individual links and route selection. The routing schemes essentially rely on efficient shortest path algorithms such as the Bellman-Ford [46] or Dijkstra algorithm [47] to compute the optimal route.

While {{it is well known}} that some paths are better than others, a significant number of routing protocols do not focus on utilizing optimal paths. However, cooperative diversity, an area of recent interest, provides techniques to efficiently exploit path and channel diversity. This paper examines the potential performance improvements offered by path diversity. Three settings are examined, namely, where the path loss and channel correlation are neglected, where path loss is considered, but channel correlation is neglected, and where path loss and channel correlation are both accounted for. It is shown that by exploiting path diversity, dramatic improvements in the considered <b>route</b> <b>metric</b> may be achieved. Furthermore, in some settings, if the link statistics are held constant, then when path diversity is exploited, the <b>route</b> <b>metric</b> improves with path length.

40|$|In IEEE 802. 16 Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) routing, delay aware load {{balancing}} {{can be achieved}} by selecting the shortest path with low latency and network load. But network load and latency together are not considered in most of the existing routing metrics. Here, we propose a delay aware load balanced routing protocol for wireless mesh networks by designing a combined <b>route</b> <b>metric.</b> Initially, we calculate the metric of traffic interference (TIM) which considers the traffic load of interfering neighbors. Next, we calculate the metric for end to end service delay (EDM) by using the expected time spent in transmitting all packets waiting for transmission through a link. This metric can be used to select the path with the lowest end-to-end service delay in terms of current network load. Using these two metrics we define a combined <b>route</b> <b>metric</b> for efficient route selection. A route discovery mechanism is proposed which broadcasts request packets along with expected link delay and load value. The suitable path is selected based upon the least routing metric value. A route maintenance mechanism is also proposed to maintain the stability of the network. Using this, frequent changes in the path can be avoided and transmission efficiency is increased.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{a set of}} serious performance problems observed on the CityMesh 50 -node 802. 11 b urban rooftop network that existing routing protocols do not consider. The original CityMesh routing protocol, based on DSR and ETX, delivered median TCP throughput of 20 kilobytes per second, despite the use of radios that could drive most individual links at much higher rates. The key problems included varying link loss rates, transient bursts of losses on otherwise high-quality links, poor transmit bit-rate selection at the 802. 11 level, failure to identify high throughput routes in the multiple bit-rate network, and interference between bulk data traffic and routing protocol updates. The paper describes SrcRR, a new routing protocol that includes solutions to these problems. SrcRR extends ETX by predicting the best 802. 11 transmission bit-rate on each link. SrcRR monitors the loss rates of the links in each path it is using, {{as well as the}} loss rates of nearby alternate links, to ensure that it continues to use the best route. SrcRR switches to a new route only if the new <b>route’s</b> <b>metric</b> is significantly better than that of the existing route. SrcRR performs more aggressive link-level retransmission than 802. 11, and does not switch routes in response to modest numbers of lost packets. SrcRR uses its own transmit bit-rate selection algorithm based on medium-term loss rate measurements, replacing the algorithm built into the radio firmware. The paper presents an experimental evaluation of SrcRR on CityMesh. SrcRR improves the median bulk TCP throughput between pairs of nodes from 20 KB/s to 110 KB/s. SrcRR achieves these improvements primarily by reducing the loss rate visible to TCP, which avoids TCP timeouts and consequent idle time, and by improved choice of link transmission bit-rate. 1...|$|R

In RFAR, for each class of data, a threshold is set as the maximum tolerable probability that the route breaks before the requesting session ends. If, during the route discovery phase, the cumulative robustness of the partially discovered route indicates a route failure probability surpassing this threshold, then the route request is not forwarded. The main drawback of RFAR is that it relies on nodes being able to estimate their own speed, via GPS receivers or some location-determination system, and this may limit the application of RFAR.|$|R

While in [12], a dead zone protocol is presented to form cooperative links between CR nodes under active PUs’ interference areas (Dead Zone), through which multiple cooperative paths are reconfigured to transmit data. Although this type solutions could solve disjoint multi-path routing problem in CR networks in some respects, priori routing knowledge is necessary, which would cost exponential level time complexity for processing.
