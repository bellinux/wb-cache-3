40|$|Objective/Background: A {{previous}} budget {{impact analysis}} regarding a supervised exercise therapy (SET) first treatment strategy (stepped care model [SCM]) for Dutch patients with intermittent claudication (IC) showed a low referral rate in 2009, despite solid {{evidence of the}} effectiveness of SET programs. Recently, several campaigns have stimulated stakeholders in the field to adopt a SET first strategy in patients with IC. The aim {{of the present study was}} to reassess SCM adherence after a 2 year period. Methods: IC <b>related</b> <b>invoices</b> of patients in 2011 were obtained from a large Dutch health insurance company (3. 5 million persons). Patients were divided into two groups based on their initial treatment. A SET group had started SET between 12 months before (initiated by general practitioner) and 3 months after (initiated by vascular surgeon) presentation at a vascular surgery outpatient clinic. An intervention (INT) group was treated by revascularisation within 3 months of outpatient presentation. Costs of IC treatment in this 2011 cohort were compared with the earlier 2009 cohort. Results: IC <b>related</b> <b>invoices</b> of 4135 patients were available. In 2011, the initial treatment was SET in 56 % (2009 : 34 %; + 22 % [p <. 001]) and INT in 44 % (2009 : 66 %; - 22 % [p <. 001]) of the IC population. Additional revascularisation was performed in 19 % of patients in the SET group (2009 : 6 %; + 13 % [p <. 001]) and also in 19 % of patients in the INT group (2009 : 35 %; - 16 % [p <. 001]). Later on, 29 % of patients in the INT group were referred for SET (2009 : 10 %; + 19 % [p <. 001]). Average costs of IC treatment per patient in 2011 were 6 % lower than in 2009 ((sic) 6885 vs. (sic) 7300; p =. 020). Conclusion: A 22 % increase in adherence to SET as a first treatment strategy in Dutch patients with IC was attained between 2009 and 2011. This shift suggests successful SCM implementation resulting in lower costs for the national healthcare system. (C) 2017 European Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|ObjectivesInternational {{guidelines}} recommend supervised exercise therapy (SET) {{as primary}} treatment for intermittent claudication (IC). The {{aim of this}} study was to calculate treatment costs in patients with IC and to estimate nationwide annual savings if a stepped care model (SCM, primary SET treatment followed by revascularization in case of SET failure) was followed. MethodsInvoice data of all patients with IC in 2009 were obtained from a Dutch health insurance company (3. 4 million members). Patients were divided into three groups based on initial treatment after diagnosis (t 0). The SET group received SET initiated at any time between 12 months before and up to 3 months after t 0. The intervention group (INT) underwent endovascular or open revascularization between t 0 and t+ 3  months. The third group (REST) received neither SET nor any intervention. All peripheral arterial disease <b>related</b> <b>invoices</b> were recorded during 2 years and average costs per patient were calculated. Savings following use of a SCM were calculated for three scenarios. ResultsData on 4954 patients were analyzed. Initial treatment was SET (n =  701, 14. 1 %), INT (n =  1363, 27. 5 %), or REST (n =  2890, 58. 3 %). Within 2 years from t 0, invasive revascularization in the SET group was performed in 45 patients (6. 4 %). Additional interventions (primary at other location and/or re-interventions) were performed in 480 INT patients (35. 2 %). Some 431 REST patients received additional SET (n =  299, 10. 3 %) or an intervention (n =  132, 4. 5 %). Mean total IC related costs per patient were € 2, 191, € 9851 and € 824 for SET, INT, and REST, respectively. Based on a hypothetical worst, moderate, and best case scenario, some 3. 8, 20. 6, or 33. 0 million euros would have been saved per annum if SCM was implemented in the Dutch healthcare system.

40|$|For (forensic) {{auditing}} purposes {{it is useful}} to have a wise view of how pro- cesses are performed in an organisation. Workflow mining can help in creating such a view by mining workflow models that give a visual representation of the processes. But not all organisations use workflow management systems that produce the needed event logs that are used as input for the workflow min- ing techniques. What this research is set to accomplish is to design a stepwise approach that extracts these event logs from corporate network data that is available in any organisation To accomplish this the stepwise approach must extract caseIDs, activities and the order in which the activities occur. The fo- cus of the approach is on the process around invoices. The approach that have been designed has four steps. 1. Indexing of the Corporate Network Data 2. Mining the invoice numbers to be used as caseIDs 3. Document discovery of all the documents that are <b>related</b> to the <b>invoice</b> process. 4. Extracting the activities those documents support. The case study shows that the event logs can indeed be created and a work- flow model is mined from those event logs. Thought the validation {{of the quality of the}} mined workflow model is very difficult. The approach does look promising for extracting event logs.

However, after leaving port Orsborne informed the crew that they would be going on an extended cruise in more southerly waters. Nothing more was heard of them until mid-May when the owners, who had by then assumed the vessel lost, received <b>invoices</b> <b>relating</b> to its repair and reprovisioning in the north Spanish port of Corcubión late in April.

After the vessel's capture and detention following a chase outside Georgetown, British Guiana, Orsborne and his crew were hailed as heroes by much of the world's press. Back in England, Orsborne was tried for the theft of the Girl Pat and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment. Many years later, in his memoirs, Orsborne made the uncorroborated claim that the voyage was an undercover operation carried out on behalf of British Naval Intelligence, with the aim of undermining General Franco's rebellion against the Spanish government, in the run-up to the Spanish Civil War.|$|R
40|$|Effective {{methods of}} {{traceability}} are urgently required {{for use in}} research {{as well as in}} different types of aquaculture operations and to control trade in aquatic animals and products. In regard to the marking of fish, many different tagging methods have been described and the method to be used depends on the purpose and need for tagging. In contrast, for molluscs and crustaceans, only a few methods of marking such animals have been described, due to the practical difficulties. The authors first describe the different methods for tracing fish and fishery products, by means of external tags, such as Floy tags, Carlin tags and passive integrated transponder tags; chemical marking using inorganic substances such as silver nitrate or potassium nitrate, pigments, oxytetracycline, etc.; and several different types of electronic devices in which basic information such as the strain of fish, farm of origin or weight can be stored. Genetic traceability using deoxyribonucleic acid profiling is developing quite rapidly for cultured brood stocks and wild populations. This technique may be used with very high degrees of confidence to assign to or exclude animals or products from their claimed origin, paternity or strain, and may be used as evidence in court proceedings. The second section of this paper describes the traceability of live molluscs for restocking and for human consumption. In these applications, genetic markers have been demonstrated to be suitable. Mechanical tagging on a small scale for research purposes has also been used. Otherwise, the only means of tracing live molluscs are the movement documents and the labelling on boxes that certifies the origin of the commodity. The third section describes the methods available for tracing live and dead crustaceans. A large variety of physical tagging methods for decapod crustaceans is described, such as the injection of biological stains (fast green, Niagara sky blue, trypan red and blue) and external tags such as coloured streamer tags, wire tags and a variety of anchor tags. Furthermore, a number of different internal coding methods, such as the coded micro-wire tags and injected elastomer tags are discussed in detail. As is the case for fish, genetic molecular techniques are also applied in population studies of crustaceans; some of the molecular genetic methods are described. Prawns for human consumption are most frequently packed whole or as tails after the necessary sorting, washing and freezing and the only way of performing a traceback is through documents <b>relating</b> to movement, <b>invoices,</b> health certificates and labelling of the boxes. The minimum requirements for labelling would be the content of the packages, i. e. species, quantity, identification of the manufacturer (name and address), packing place, importer/exporter or vendor of the product, in addition to the loading bill number.
