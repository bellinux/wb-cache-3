40|$|Abstract—The paper {{concerns}} {{the design and}} optimization of a <b>rotary</b> <b>actuator</b> of which the rotor {{is attached to a}} linear actuator inside a two degree-of-freedom zφ-module, which is part of a pick-and-place robot. The <b>rotary</b> <b>actuator</b> provides ± 180 ° rotation, while the linear actuator offers a z-motion of ± 5 mm. In the paper, the optimal combinations of magnet poles and coils are determined for this slotless actuator with concentrated windings. Based on this analysis, the <b>rotary</b> <b>actuator</b> is optimized using a multi-physical framework, which contains a coupled electromagnetic, mechanical and thermal model. Because the rotation angle is limited, both a moving-coil design with a double mechanical clearance and a moving-magnet design with a single mechanical clearance have been investigated and compared. Additionally, the influence of the edge effects of the magnets on the performance of the <b>rotary</b> <b>actuator</b> has been investigated with both 3 D FEM simulations and measurements. I...|$|R

40|$|Although {{several types}} of {{locomotive}} microrobots have been developed, {{most of them have}} difficulty locomoting on uneven surfaces. Thus, we have been focused on microrobots that can locomote using step patterns. We are studying insect-type microrobot systems. The locomotion of the microrobot is generated by rotational movements of the shape memory alloy-type <b>rotary</b> <b>actuator.</b> In addition, we have constructed artificial neural networks by using analog integrated circuit (IC) technology. The artificial neural networks can output the driving waveform without using software programs. The shape memory alloy-type <b>rotary</b> <b>actuator</b> and the artificial neural networks are constructed with silicon wafers; they can be integrated by using micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) technology. As a result, the MEMS microrobot system can locomote using step patterns. The insect-type MEMS microrobot system is 0. 079 g in weight and less than 5. 0 mm in size, and its locomotion speed is 2 mm/min. The locomotion speed is slow because the heat of the shape memory alloy conducts to the mechanical parts of the MEMS microrobot.

50|$|Artificial {{muscle is}} a generic term used for {{materials}} or devices that can reversibly contract, expand, or rotate within one component {{due to an}} external stimulus (such as voltage, current, pressure or temperature). The three basic actuation responses - contraction, expansion, and rotation - can be combined together within a single component to produce other types of motions (e.g. bending, by contracting {{one side of the}} material while expanding the other side). Conventional motors and pneumatic linear or <b>rotary</b> <b>actuators</b> do not qualify as artificial muscles, because {{there is more than one}} component involved in the actuation.|$|E
50|$|Where {{a supply}} of vacuum is available, but not {{pneumatic}} power, <b>rotary</b> <b>actuators</b> have even been made to work from vacuum power. The only common instance of these was for early automatic windscreen wipers on cars up until around 1960.

Lightly loaded rotary gear actuators can be completely made of composite plastic material. Such electromechanical <b>rotary</b> <b>actuators</b> are installed, for example, on power windows of automobiles. Higher loaded actuators can contain metallic gears inside plastic composite housing for reduction of cost and corrosion resistance.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the high {{performance}} adaptive robust motion control of electrohydraulic servo system driven by dual vane hydraulic <b>rotary</b> <b>actuator.</b> The recently developed adaptive robust control theory is used to handle the nonlinearities and modelling uncertainties in hydraulic systems. Aside from the difficulty of handling parametric variations, the traditional adaptive robust controller (ARC) is also a little complicated in practice. To address these challenging issues, a simplified adaptive robust control with varying boundary discontinuous projection is developed to enhance the robustness of the closed-loop system, based on the features of hydraulic <b>rotary</b> <b>actuator.</b> Compared with previous ARC controller, the resulting controller has a simple algorithm for more suitable implementation and can handle parametric variations via nonlinear robust design. The controller theoretically achieves a guaranteed transient performance and final tracking accuracy {{in the presence of}} both parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinearities. Extensive simulation results are obtained for a hydraulic <b>rotary</b> <b>actuator</b> to verify the high performance nature of proposed control strategy...|$|R

50|$|This mutual {{stiffening}} also permits simple construction: Stewart platform hexapods chains use {{prismatic joint}} linear actuators between any-axis universal ball joints. The ball joints are passive: simply free to move, without actuators or brakes; their position is constrained solely {{by the other}} chains. Delta robots have base-mounted <b>rotary</b> <b>actuators</b> that move a light, stiff, parallelogram arm. The effector is mounted between the tips of three of these arms and again, it may be mounted with simple ball-joints. Static representation of a parallel robot is often akin {{to that of a}} pin-jointed truss: the links and their actuators feel only tension or compression, without any bending or torque, which again reduces the effects of any flexibility to off-axis forces.|$|E

40|$|A fuzzy robust {{nonlinear}} controller for hydraulic <b>rotary</b> <b>actuators</b> {{in flight}} motion simulators is proposed. Compared with other three-order models of hydraulic <b>rotary</b> <b>actuators,</b> the proposed controller based on first-order nonlinear model is more easily applied in practice, whose control law is relatively simple. It {{not only does}} not need high-order derivative of desired command, but also {{does not require the}} feedback signals of velocity, acceleration and jerk of hydraulic <b>rotary</b> <b>actuators.</b> Another advantage {{is that it does not}} rely on any information of friction, inertia force and external disturbing force/torque, which are always difficult to resolve in flight motion simulators. Due to the special composite vane seals of rectangular cross-section and goalpost shape used in hydraulic <b>rotary</b> <b>actuators,</b> the leakage model is more complicated than that of traditional linear hydraulic cylinders. Adaptive multi-input single-output (MISO) fuzzy compensators are introduced to estimate nonlinear uncertain functions about leakage and bulk modulus. Meanwhile, the decomposition of the uncertainties is used to reduce the total number of fuzzy rules. Different from other adaptive fuzzy compensators, a discontinuous projection mapping is employed to guarantee the estimation process to be bounded. Furthermore, with a sufficient number of fuzzy rules, the controller theoretically can guarantee asymptotic tracking performance in the presence of the above uncertainties, which is very important for high-accuracy tracking control of flight motion simulators. Comparative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which can guarantee transient performance and better final accurate tracking in the presence of uncertain nonlinearities and parametric uncertainties...|$|E

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{necessity to}} miniaturize smooth torque <b>rotary</b> <b>actuators</b> has placed severe {{constraints on the}} current slotless permanent-magnet technology. These constraints are mainly the consequence of the relatively large effective magnetic airgap which limits the achievable magnetic loading and, therefore, the torque density of slotless permanent-magnet <b>rotary</b> <b>actuators.</b> Further, the miniaturization has to be achieved at ever-decreasing costs and, therefore, it would be advantageous to implement solid back irons.
