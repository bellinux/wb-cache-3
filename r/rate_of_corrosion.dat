25|$|The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>corrosion</b> {{protective}} {{formation is}} temperature dependent. For example, at 27°C (i.e., a common inlet {{temperature in the}} Middle East), rapid film formation and good corrosion protection can be expected within a few hours. At 16°C, it could take 2–3 months for the protection to mature. But once a good surface film forms, corrosion rates decrease, normally to 0.02–0.002mm/yr, as protective layers develop {{over a period of}} years. These alloys have good resistance to chloride pitting and crevice corrosion and are not susceptible to chloride stress corrosion.|$|E
25|$|The copper patinas {{are very}} thin: just 0.05080–0.07620millimeters in thickness. Yet, {{they are highly}} {{adherent}} to the underlying copper metal. The initial and intermediate oxide and sulfide patina films are not particularly corrosion resistant. The final sulfate patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to all forms of atmospheric corrosion and protects the underlying metal against further weathering. As patination progresses and the durable sulfate layer forms, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>corrosion</b> decreases, averaging between 0.0001–0.0003millimeters per year. For a 0.6millimeter-thick sheet, this equates to less than 5% corrosion {{over a period of}} 100 years. Further information is available on copper patination.|$|E

Stress corrosion cracking in aluminum superstructures of Naval vessels is a multibillion-dollar maintenance problem, which requires more scientific understanding to better predict and mitigate. To investigate the role of applied stress on these corrosion-related processes, rolled plate of AA 5083 was placed under tensile stress through bending while being subject to elevated temperature and salt spray. Nitric acid mass loss tests quantified the amount of sensitization {{as a function of}} stress level.
