5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in late 2009 by the National Addiction Centre (UK) found 41.3% of readers of Mixmag had used mephedrone {{in the last}} month, making it the fourth-most popular drug amongst clubbers. Of those, two thirds snorted the drug and the average dosage per session was 0.9g; the length of sessions increased as the dosage increased. Users who snorted the drug <b>reported</b> <b>using</b> more per session than those who took it orally (0.97g compared to 0.74g) and also <b>reported</b> <b>using</b> it more often (five days per month compared to three days per month). An Irish study of people on a methadone treatment program for heroin addicts found 29 of 209 patients tested positive for mephedrone usage.|$|E

5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} in {{the emergency}} setting can be difficult with the fiberoptic bronchoscope due to blood, vomit, or secretions in the airway and poor patient cooperation. Because of this, patients with massive facial injury, complete upper airway obstruction, severely diminished ventilation, or profuse upper airway bleeding are poor candidates for fiberoptic intubation. Fiberoptic intubation under general anesthesia typically requires two skilled individuals. Success rates of only 83–87% have been <b>reported</b> <b>using</b> fiberoptic techniques {{in the emergency}} department, with significant nasal bleeding occurring in up to 22% of patients. These drawbacks limit the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy somewhat in urgent and emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|A {{multitude}} of languages {{are used by}} 35 million Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 60% and 20% of Canadians respectively. In 2011, nearly 6.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some {{of the most common}} non-official first languages include Chinese (mainly Cantonese; 1,072,555 first-language speakers), Punjabi (430,705), Spanish (410,670), German (409,200), and Italian (407,490). Less than one percent of Canadians (just over 250,000 individuals) can speak an indigenous language. About half this number (129,865) <b>reported</b> <b>using</b> an indigenous language on a daily basis. Additionally, Canadians speak several sign languages; the number of speakers is unknown of the most spoken ones, American Sign Language (ASL) and Quebec Sign Language (LSQ), as it is of Maritime Sign Language and Plains Sign Talk. There are only 47 speakers of the Inuit sign language Inuiuuk.|$|E
5|$|Although {{couples are}} {{starting}} to use condoms during extramarital intercourse more frequently, condom use during marital sex is still viewed as inappropriate by many Malawians; in 2000, only 2.3% of people <b>reported</b> <b>using</b> condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with their spouses. Some people believe that condoms are only necessary during sex with high-risk partners such as sex workers, and that condom use during marital sex implies infidelity. Others believe that marital condom use violates the religious purposes of marriage: sexual pleasure and reproduction. In {{a study published in}} 2007 by Agnes M. Chimbiri, men claimed that they use condoms with their wives for the sake of avoiding unwanted pregnancies; on the other hand, they were more concerned about sexually transmitted infections when discussing condom use with extramarital sexual partners.|$|E

5|$|No part of M-134 {{is listed}} on the National Highway System, a system of roadways {{important}} to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. In 2009, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) conducted a survey to determine the traffic volume along the highway, <b>reported</b> <b>using</b> a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). The department determined that the highest count was the 3,595vehicles a day that used the highway west of the M-129 junction in Cedarville; the lowest counts were 608vehicles daily between the M-48 junction and the De Tour village limits. On the island, 667vehicles use M-134 daily. According to tourism officials in the area, over 100,000vehicles per year are transported round trip on the ferry with almost twice as many additional passengers.|$|E
5|$|Various chromatographic {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to detect psilocin in body fluids: the rapid emergency drug identification system (REMEDi HS), a drug screening method based on HPLC; HPLC with electrochemical detection; GC–MS; and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Although the determination of psilocin levels in urine can be performed without sample clean-up (i.e., removing potential contaminants that make it difficult to accurately assess concentration), the analysis in plasma or serum requires a preliminary extraction, followed by derivatization of the extracts in the case of GC–MS. A specific immunoassay has also been developed to detect psilocin in whole blood samples. A 2009 publication <b>reported</b> <b>using</b> HPLC to quickly separate forensically important illicit drugs including psilocybin and psilocin, which were identifiable within about half a minute of analysis time. These analytical techniques to determine psilocybin concentrations in body fluids are, however, not routinely available, and not typically used in clinical settings.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine and compare the factors that {{influence}} intuition as a decision&# 45;making tool for leaders&# 47;managers in Hong Kong and in the United States. This study examined the relationships among gender, management level, extent of management experience, country of operation, and the <b>reported</b> <b>use</b> of intuition in decision making. Existing empirical research in this field is sparse. In this research, attempt was made to contribute to empirical research on the viability and <b>reported</b> <b>use</b> of intuition as a decision-making skill of leaders. Agor’s Intuitive Measurement Survey &# 40;AIM&# 41; survey was adapted &# 40;with permission from copyright owner&# 41; from Weston Agor&# 39;s study to measure the relationship between a manager&# 39;s <b>reported</b> <b>use</b> of intuition in decision making and the manager&# 39;s management level, his level of management experience, the manager&# 39;s gender, and the manager&# 39;s country of operation. Each participant was electronically sent a link that led to a web page containing the survey questions. Once the respondent clicks submit, the questionnaire was mailed directly to the researcher. The research shows significant relationship between research variables. Administrative managers in Hong Kong&# 39;s <b>reported</b> <b>use</b> of intuition in decision making was significantly lower than US managers <b>reported</b> <b>use</b> of intuition in decision making. The paper concludes by examining the implications of these significant findings to global business management and management education...|$|R
