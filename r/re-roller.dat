50|$|The 1970s steel crisis {{not only}} caused {{the closure of}} the Athus {{steelworks}} in 1977, but also all mining, casting and steel making activities were ended in Rodange in 1978; the steel mill now being supplied by torpedo wagon from other ARBED steel plants. In the 1980s the plant became a <b>re-roller</b> of steel, specialising in railway rails.|$|E
50|$|In 1973 {{the company}} was merged with the Société des Hauts Fourneaux et Aciéries d'Athus to form the company Métallurgique et Minière de Rodange-Athus (MMRA), and in 1978 ARBED {{acquired}} a 25% stake in the company. From the late 1970s onward the Athus plant closed and production of steel and mining activities ceased at Rodange. The company then became a <b>re-roller</b> of steel specialising in rails. In 1994 the company merged with another Luxembourg based steel company based in Schifflange to form ARES (Aciéries Rodange Esch-Schifflange) part of ProfilARBEB, the long products division of ARBED.|$|E
40|$|Duroc Special Steel is a {{so called}} <b>re-roller</b> {{operation}} and is located within SSAB:s industrial area in Luleå. The production includes rolling, annealing and slitting of warm and cold rolled metal strips in customized sizes. Along with 17 other companies Duroc Special Steel represents the Duroc group. The company has recently {{found that the}} slitting lines set up time is far too long considering {{the current state of}} production. In some cases the slitting line becomes a bottleneck operation. This occurs when the employees do not have enough time to finish a set up before the new product is ready to be produced. Therefore a study is needed to examine {{what can be done to}} shorten the set up time and also improve the building operation of the slitting tools, which is the main part of the set work. As a result, this thesis has been developed based on these two main problems; set up time and building slitting tools. The goal of this master thesis is therefore to demonstrate the ability to shorten set up times, improve set work and its work practices and also give solutions as to how this can be accomplished. The project’s primary implementation is based on a literature study consisting mainly of the SMED method, but also set up time and workers participation. Additionally during the project SMED has been the prinicipal tool for the task at hand and has therefore had a significant role in the work. Workers participation, in the form of completed workshops, has also been of great importance to the project. The literature study was used to anchor the implementation of the project and its ideas to achieve a result with credibility. A specification of demands was made containing criteria of what the solutions would bring and result in. It was later used in the project’s final stage to evaluate the different solutions and ideas. The problem solving of this master thesis has resulted in several proposals of what can be done to shorten the set up time, reduce the risk of bottleneck operations, improve set work and the building of the slitting tools. These proposed solutions shows both time and financial savings for the company and also the percentage of improval compared to the current set up time. Therefore the proposed solutions shows tangible improvements of 6 % to the set up time and also up to 40 % and 55 %, respectively, in case of slitting and packaging becoming bottleneck operations. Duroc Special Steel is recommended to gradually implement these proposed solutions in order to reduce set up time, improve set work and its work practices. Validerat; 20110323 (anonymous...|$|E
50|$|Mini steel {{plants are}} smaller, have {{electric}} furnaces, use steel scrap and sponge iron. They have <b>re-rollers</b> that use steel ingots as well. They produce and introduce mild and alloy steel of certain specifications. There are around 650 mini steel plants in India.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to study plant layout of Pratap <b>Re-Rollers</b> {{and based on the}} systematic layout planning method, design a new layout for increased productivity and reduction in material handling. The detailed study of the plant layout such as operation process chart, flow of material and activity relationship chart has been investigated. The systematic layout planning method showed that new plant layout significantly decrease the distance of material flow from stores until usage spots. It is vitally important to have a well-developed plant layout for all the available resources in an optimum manner and get the maximum out of the capacity of the facilities. The problem is of particular importance for Small and Medium Enterprises such as Pratap <b>Re-Rollers</b> where major constraint such as cost and space play an important role...|$|R
