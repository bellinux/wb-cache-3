5|$|The {{giving of}} the first kvitel cements {{the status of a}} newly {{appointed}} Hasidic Rebbe. In Belz tradition, the first kvitel to a new Rebbe is proffered by a follower of the Ropshitz Hasidic dynasty. Thus, when <b>Rabbi</b> Yissachar Dov Rokeach assumed the mantle of leadership in 1894 {{after the death of his}} father, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehoshua Rokeach, he was given his first kvitel by <b>Rabbi</b> Yissachar Dov of Bisk, a follower of the Ropshitz dynasty. Thirty-three years later, following the funeral of <b>Rabbi</b> Yissachar Dov Rokeach, Rokeach's son and successor, <b>Rabbi</b> Aharon Rokeach, received his first kvitelach from <b>Rabbi</b> Yissachar Dov of Bisk and two other followers of the Ropshitz dynasty.|$|E
50|$|The Orthodox rabbinical {{establishment}} {{rejects the}} validity of Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist <b>rabbis</b> {{on the grounds that}} their movements' teachings are in violation of traditional Jewish tenets. Some Modern Orthodox <b>rabbis</b> are respectful toward non-Orthodox <b>rabbis</b> and focus on commonalities even as they disagree on interpretation of some areas of Halakha (with Conservative <b>rabbis)</b> or the authority of Halakha (with Reform and Reconstructionist <b>rabbis).</b>|$|R

5|$|Founded in 1852 by <b>Rabbi</b> Abraham Ash as Beth Hamedrash, the {{congregation}} split in 1859, with the <b>rabbi</b> {{and most of}} the members renaming their congregation Beth Hamedrash Hagodol. The congregation's president and a small number of the members eventually formed the nucleus of Kahal Adath Jeshurun, also known as the Eldridge Street Synagogue. <b>Rabbi</b> Jacob Joseph, the first and only Chief <b>Rabbi</b> of New York City, led {{the congregation}} from 1888 to 1902. <b>Rabbi</b> Ephraim Oshry, one of the few European Jewish legal decisors to survive the Holocaust, led the congregation from 1952 to 2003.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, the {{congregation}} hired Oakland's first <b>rabbi,</b> Meyer Solomon Levy.

Meyer Solomon Levy had been ordained in England as an Orthodox <b>rabbi</b> before he was twenty, and moved to Australia as a young man. An early supporter of Zionism, he had served as a <b>rabbi</b> in Melbourne before moving to California in 1872 or 1873, where he served as the <b>rabbi</b> of Temple Emanu-El (then Bickur Cholim) in San Jose.

25|$|In the Lithuanian yeshiva world, many {{prominent}} figures wear a black {{frock coat}} {{also known as}} a kapotteh (accompanied by either a Homburg or fedora hat) as formal wear. In recent years many Sefardi <b>rabbis</b> also wear a similar frock coat. The frock coat amongst Jews is usually reserved for a rosh yeshiva, (maybe also the mashgiach and other senior <b>rabbis</b> of the yeshiva) and other <b>rabbis</b> such as important communal <b>rabbis</b> and some chief <b>rabbis.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1891, Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan offered Sparger {{a salary}} larger than Beth Elohim could match, {{and he moved}} there. Beth Elohim {{subsequently}} split the offices of cantor and <b>rabbi,</b> hiring G. Taubenhaus as <b>rabbi</b> and the Mauritz Weisskopf as cantor.|$|E

5|$|In 1982 Scheindlin {{stated that}} the {{membership}} had grown {{to the point where}} it again required the services of a full-time <b>rabbi,</b> and the congregation hired Jonathan Ginsburg as its first full-time <b>rabbi</b> since Israel Goldfarb's retirement. Ginsburg developed adult education and young singles programs, and improved standards in the synagogue's children's education programs. Geoffrey Goldberg followed him as <b>rabbi</b> from 1987 to 1988.|$|E

5|$|The {{congregation}} initially {{consisted of}} only ten families and met in several temporary locations {{before moving to}} a permanent building. These locations included a house on 24th Avenue and 9th Street, a room above Carney's Grocery Store, and Sheehan Hall. In this interim period, the congregation grew to include 50 members by 1878, with David Burgheim serving as <b>rabbi.</b> The Middle Eastern style building {{at the corner of}} 8th Street and 22nd Avenue, constructed by the growing congregation in 1879, was the first building in the city with gas-powered lighting. <b>Rabbi</b> Burgheim was succeeded by <b>Rabbi</b> W. Weinstein, then <b>Rabbi</b> Jacobs, and then <b>Rabbi</b> Judah Wechsler. Wechsler, who became <b>rabbi</b> in 1887, led a movement to provide public schools for blacks, which culminated in a bond issue to construct the first brick public school building for African Americans in the state. The Wechsler School was named after him and has since been listed on the National Register of Historic Places and as a Mississippi Landmark. The congregation stayed in this building for several years, before eventually being forced to move due to complaints of flies attracted by horse droppings outside of a nearby retail store.|$|E
