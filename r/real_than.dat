25|$|The Tibetan Buddhism {{tradition}} emphasizes an instructive and devotional {{relationship to}} a guru; this may involve devotional practices known as guru yoga which are congruent with prayer. It also appears that Tibetan Buddhism posits {{the existence of}} various deities, but the peak view of the tradition is that the deities or yidam are no more existent or <b>real</b> <b>than</b> the continuity (Sanskrit: santana; refer mindstream) of the practitioner, environment and activity. But how practitioners engage yidam or tutelary deities will depend upon the level or more appropriately yana at which they are practicing. At one level, one may pray to a deity for protection or assistance, taking a more subordinate role. At another level, one may invoke the deity, on a more equal footing. And {{at a higher level}} one may deliberately cultivate the idea that one has become the deity, whilst remaining aware that its ultimate nature is śūnyatā. The views of the more esoteric yana are impenetrable for those without direct experience and empowerment.|$|E

In seeking to address the ontological nature of the unobserved world, he considered quantum theory to be not merely a successful mathematical analogy, but a literal description of the underlying reality. In Herbert's description of Heisenberg's view, the unobserved world is a world composed of possibility, qualitatively less <b>real</b> <b>than</b> the world of observed fact.|$|E

500|$|The {{change from}} full motion video to {{computer}} generated characters in End of Ages was well received. Macworld {{stated that the}} change was initially jarring, but ultimately helped increase the realism of the game. IGN's Juan Castro said that the characters felt more <b>real</b> <b>than</b> the full motion video actors of previous games; one reason, the reviewer stated, was because the actors spoke their lines with real conviction. Gamezone credited each character's individualized body language as contributing to their realism. GameSpot stated that Esher moved and acted like a real person, and that the voice of David Ogden Stiers brought [...] "this interesting character to life"; the reviewer did feel that the revelation of Esher and Yeesha's motivations was a letdown, as the character's true motivations were revealed [...] "with all the unpleasant abruptness of turning on bright, fluorescent lights in a dark room." [...] Dissenting reviewers such as 1UP.com and G4tv considered the character's monologues [...] "hyper emotional", although reviewer Karen Chu admitted the characters still presented a compelling morality play.|$|E
500|$|The {{book has}} been called [...] "feminist", and more {{specifically}} [...] "vintage Atwood-feminist", but Atwood disagrees, saying, [...] "I wouldn't even call it feminist. Every time you write something {{from the point of}} view of a woman, people say that it's feminist." [...] The Penelopiads antagonistic relationship between Penelope and Helen is similar to the relationships of women in Atwood's previous novels: Elaine and Cordelia in Cat's Eye, and Iris and Laura in The Blind Assassin, and follows Atwood's doubt of an amicable universal sisterhood. The story does endorse some feminist reassessments of the Odyssey, like Penelope recognizing Odysseus while disguised and that the geese slaughtered by the eagle in Penelope's dream were her maids and not the suitors. Using the maids' lecture on anthropology, Atwood satirizes Robert Graves' theory of a matriarchal lunar cult in Greek myth. The lecture makes a series of connections, concluding that the rape and execution of the maids by men represent the overthrow of the matriarchal society in favor of patriarchy. The lecture ends with lines from anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss' Elementary Structures of Kinship: [...] "Consider us pure symbol. We're no more <b>real</b> <b>than</b> money." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} one of two X-Files episodes to take place in real time—wherein events are {{presented}} at the same rate that the audience experiences them—the other being the sixth season episode [...] "Triangle". Due {{to the nature of the}} shooting schedule, the episode was relatively cheap to film and production moved at a quick pace. Initially, the actors struggled with the new cinéma vérité style of the episode, and several takes were needed for scenes during the first few days, but these problems receded as filming progressed. On one night, three-and-a-half pages of script were shot in only two hours; the normal rate for The X-Files was three to four pages a day. Both Watkins and Mills likened the filming of the episode to live theater. The former noted, [...] "In a sense we were doing theater: we were doing an act, or half of a whole act in one take." [...] Anderson called the performance [...] "fun" [...] to shoot, and highlighted [...] "Scully getting pissed off at the camera crew" [...] as her favorite part to play. She further noted that [...] "it was interesting to make the adjustment to playing something more <b>real</b> <b>than</b> you might play for television." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1930 Gielgud {{finished}} the season playing Hamlet. Williams's production used the complete {{text of the}} play. This {{was regarded as a}} radical innovation; extensive cuts had been customary for earlier productions. A running time of nearly five hours did not dampen the enthusiasm of the public, the critics or the acting profession. Sybil Thorndike said, [...] "I never hoped to see Hamlet played as in one's dreams... I've had an evening of being swept right off my feet into another life – far more <b>real</b> <b>than</b> the life I live in, and moved, moved beyond words." [...] The production gained such a reputation that the Old Vic began to attract large numbers of West End theatregoers. Demand was so great that the cast moved to the Queen's Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue, where Williams staged the piece with the text discreetly shortened. The effect of the cuts was to give the title role even more prominence. Gielgud's Hamlet was richly praised by the critics. Ivor Brown called it [...] "a tremendous performance... the best Hamlet of [...] experience." [...] James Agate wrote, [...] "I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that it is the high water-mark of English Shakespearean acting of our time." ...|$|E
500|$|In his memoir, Eminent Hipsters, Fagen {{notes that}} the cover figure [...] "wasn't {{supposed}} to be a stand-in for any particular jazz DJ," [...] but noted a few personalities from the period that factored into the creation: Ed Beach, Dan Morgenstern, Martin Williams, R.D. Harlan, [...] "Symphony Sid" [...] Torin, and what Fagen regarded as his [...] "main man", WEVD's Mort Fega. [...] "He was laid-back, knowledgeable, and forthright, the cool uncle you wished you'd had." [...] At the time of the album's release, he remembered that jazz music offered him an escape from the adults in his life: [...] "When I saw E.T.,' I realized that the E.T. in my bedroom was my Thelonious Monk records. Everything that he represented was totally unworldly in a way, although at the same time jazz to me seemed more <b>real</b> <b>than</b> the environment in which I was living." [...] The Wall Street Journal Robert J. Toth writes, [...] "The cover adds another layer of autobiography. On the front, we see Mr. Fagen as a crew-cut deejay on the graveyard shift. On the back is his audience, a single lighted window in a row of tract homes — or maybe the artist as a young man, drinking in inspiration." [...] Robert Palmer, of The New York Times, continued in this line of thinking: [...] "Inside, there's a teenager with his ear next to a portable radio. He's playing it softly, so his parents won't wake up, and he can barely make out the sounds through the static. [...] The teenager was Donald Fagen." ...|$|E

500|$|Lauer {{thought that}} the surge in {{interest}} in bacon products prior to the book's publication was [...] "media driven". She noted that a response to political correctness as related to cooking and food consumption may have driven interest in the product. Lauer said that bacon seems to be [...] "the one thing that people are unwilling to give up". In a post of her blog in March 2009, Lauer lamented those that were willing to posit {{an end to the}} trend of interest in bacon. She commented, [...] "Bacon is something that everybody is familiar with and most people grew up eating. It has a comfort aspect to it and a familiarity. It's also got an addictive aspect to it— that sweet and salty combination of flavors." [...] She asserted that interest in the product is as much due to the culture surrounding it as to bacon itself. [...] "Current food trends focus on eating real and eating local, and there's nothing more <b>real</b> <b>than</b> a delicious strip of bacon. In many U.S. cities, local producers and chefs are making a name for themselves because of bacon," [...] said Lauer. She stated that [...] "most chefs would admit that bacon has long been one of their secret weapons in the kitchen." [...] The book was marketed as the [...] "most comprehensive book about bacon to date". Lauer promoted her book in a September 2009 appearance as a co-host at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Tour in Pennsylvania, hosted by fellow bacon blogger Jason Mosley (Mr. Baconpants, at mrbaconpants.com).|$|E
500|$|Madhayamaka Buddhism goes even further, finding {{fault with}} the monist view of physicalist philosophies of mind {{as well in}} that these {{generally}} posit matter and energy as the fundamental substance of reality. [...] Nonetheless, this {{does not imply that}} the cartesian dualist view is correct, rather Madhyamaka regards as error any affirming view of a fundamental substance to reality.In denying the independent self-existence of all the phenomena that make up the world of our experience, the Madhyamaka view departs from both the substance dualism of Descartes and the substance monism—namely, physicalism—that is characteristic of modern science. The physicalism propounded by many contemporary scientists seems to assert that the real world is composed of physical things-in-themselves, while all mental phenomena are regarded as mere appearances, devoid of any reality in and of themselves. Much is made of this difference between appearances and reality.Indeed, physicalism or the idea that matter is the only fundamental substance of reality is explicitly rejected by Buddhism.In the Madhyamaka view, mental events are no more or less <b>real</b> <b>than</b> physical events. In terms of our common-sense experience, differences of kind do exist between physical and mental phenomena. While the former commonly have mass, location, velocity, shape, size, and numerous other physical attributes, these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena. For example, we do not commonly conceive of the feeling of affection for another person as having mass or location. These physical attributes are no more appropriate to other mental events such as sadness, a recalled image from one’s childhood, the visual perception of a rose, or consciousness of any sort. Mental phenomena are, therefore, not regarded as being physical, {{for the simple reason that}} they lack many of the attributes that are uniquely characteristic of physical phenomena. Thus, Buddhism has never adopted the physicalist principle that regards only physical things as real.|$|E
500|$|On 13 December 2012, {{the group}} posted a lyric video of [...] "Change Your Life" [...] on their Vevo account.

On 15 January 2013, Jade Thirlwall told Robert Copsey of Digital Spy that the music video will showcase Little Mix's individual personalities, [...] "We always want our videos {{to be the best}} we can do," [...] Thirlwall explained. She also revealed that the video will be more mellow and <b>real</b> <b>than</b> the group's previous music videos. [...] "We're just chilling and portraying the song and performing it how it should be; there are no fireworks or backflips, it's just us delivering a great song," [...] Thirlwall added. Little Mix wanted to showcase who they are with the video by centering it more around themselves than in previous music videos. The official music video for [...] "Change Your Life" [...] was set to be released on 18 January 2013, but it premiered on Vevo on 31 January instead. It was filmed in two days. Scenes from the video were filmed at the Rhyl Pavilion Theatre in Rhyl when the group were performing a show there as part of their DNA Tour at the end of January in 2013. A spokesman for the theatre said, [...] "We are very proud to be featured as part of Little Mix's 'Change Your Life' video and feel it's a huge achievement for the Rhyl Pavilion". The video features cameos from Jade Thirlwall's mother, Norma Thirlwall, and Perrie Edwards' mother, Debbie Dufty.

2500|$|The {{importance}} {{of the theory of}} emptiness is central to the Tantric view and practice. Buddhist emptiness sees the world as being fluid, without an ontological foundation or inherent existence but ultimately a fabric of constructions. Because of this, tantric practice such as self-visualization as the deity is seen as being no less <b>real</b> <b>than</b> everyday reality, but a process of transforming reality itself, including the practitioner's identity as the deity. As Stephan Beyer notes, [...] "In a universe where all events dissolve ontologically into Emptiness, the touching of Emptiness in the ritual is the re-creation of the world in actuality".|$|E
