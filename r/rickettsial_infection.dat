40|$|Abstract. <b>Rickettsial</b> <b>infections</b> {{represent}} {{a major cause}} of non-malarial febrile illnesses among the residents of Southeast Asia and returned travelers from that region. There are several challenges in recognition, diagnosis, and management of rickettsioses endemic to Southeast Asia. This review focuses on the prevalent <b>rickettsial</b> <b>infections,</b> namely, murine typhus (Rickettsia typhi), scrub typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi), and members of spotted fever group rickettsiae. Information on epidemiology and regional variance in the prevalence of <b>rickettsial</b> <b>infections</b> is analyzed. Clinical characteristics of main groups of rickettsioses, unusual presentations, and common pitfalls in diagnosis are further discussed. In particular, relevant epidemiologic and clinical aspects on emerging spotted fever group rickettsiae in the region, such as Rickettsia honei, R. felis, R. japonica, and R. helvetica, are presented. Furthermore, challenges in laboratory diagnosis and management aspects of <b>rickettsial</b> <b>infections</b> unique to Southeast Asia are discussed, and data on emerging resistance to antimicrobial drugs and treatment/prevention options are also reviewed...|$|R

Boutonneuse fever can be seen in many places around the world, although it is endemic in countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea.

5000|$|An eschar ( [...] ; Greek: eschara) is a slough or {{piece of}} dead tissue that is cast {{off from the}} surface of the skin, {{particularly}} after a burn injury, but also seen in gangrene, ulcer, fungal infections, necrotizing spider bite wounds, spotted fevers and exposure to cutaneous anthrax. The term [...] "eschar" [...] is not interchangeable with [...] "scab". An eschar contains necrotic tissue, whereas a scab is composed of dried blood and exudate.Black eschars are most commonly attributed to anthrax, which may be contracted through herd animal exposure, but can also be obtained from Pasteurella multocida exposure in cats and rabbits. A newly identified human <b>rickettsial</b> <b>infection,</b> R. parkeri rickettsiosis, can be differentiated from Rocky Mountain spotted fever by the presence of an eschar at the site of inoculation.

40|$|The {{role of the}} {{nitric oxide}} synthase (NOS) pathway in {{inhibiting}} the ability of Rickettsia prowazekii to initially infect (invade) mouse cytokine-treated, fibroblastic L 929 cells and macrophagelike RAW 264. 7 cells {{and the ability of}} nitric oxide (NO) to damage isolated rickettsiae were investigated. Substantial amounts of nitrite (a degradation product of NO) were produced and the initial <b>rickettsial</b> <b>infection</b> was suppressed in cultures of L 929 cells treated with crude lymphokine preparations (LK) or with gamma interferon (IFN-γ) plus tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) but not in L 929 cell cultures treated with IFN-γ alone or TNF-α alone. The NOS inhibitors NG-methyl-l-arginine and aminoguanidine both inhibited nitrite production and prevented the suppression of the initial <b>rickettsial</b> <b>infection.</b> Antibody-mediated neutralization of the IFN-γ in the LK also inhibited both nitrite production and suppression of the initial <b>rickettsial</b> <b>infection.</b> Cultures of RAW 264. 7 cells treated with IFN-γ plus lipopolysaccharide exhibited suppression of the initial <b>rickettsial</b> <b>infection,</b> and the suppression was relieved by aminoguanidine. Addition of oxyhemoglobin (a scavenger of extracellular NO) during the <b>rickettsial</b> <b>infection</b> alleviated the suppression of the initial <b>rickettsial</b> <b>infection</b> observed in appropriately treated L 929 cells and RAW 264. 7 cells. In addition, the oxyhemoglobin restored the rickettsia-mediated, rapid killing of the treated RAW 264. 7 cells. Incubation of isolated rickettsiae with NO inhibited their ability to infect L 929 and IFN-γ-treated RAW 264. 7 cells and to rapidly kill IFN-γ-treated RAW 264. 7 cells. In contrast, incubation of L 929 cells with a solution that contained NO and/or degradation products of NO did not affect their ability to be infected by rickettsiae. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that NO released from appropriately stimulated potential host cells kills extracellular rickettsiae and thus prevents the rickettsiae from infecting the cells...|$|E
