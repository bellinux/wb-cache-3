It is not a theology journal, as its publications tend to be empirical papers in the aforementioned disciplines, rather than papers assessing the truth or falsity, or otherwise attempting to clarify, theological doctrines. However, the eminent theologian Paul Tillich wrote a preface to the first edition, published in 1961. A former editor, Ralph W. Hood, is a major name in the psychology of religion, having published scales to assess religious experience and mystical experience. Hood was succeeded as editor in 1999 by Ted Jelen, the first ever political scientist to edit the journal. Jelen was later succeeded as editor by sociologist Rhys Williams.

50|$|In 1427, James summoned {{parliament}} at Inverness and {{summoned the}} area chiefs. Of those, Alexander, son of Godfrey (see above) and John MacArthur (of Clan Arthur) were immediately seized and executed. Allan {{seems to have}} survived because his name is recorded in the Exchequer Rolls for the year 1428. This is the only contemporary record of Allan to exist, though his name appears in the genealogies and manuscript histories of the clan, nothing else is recorded of him. In consequence {{there is nothing to}} show whether he succeeded to his father's lands after the execution of Alexander, son of Godfrey. It is however likely that since he held a crown charter for the lands, then the king would have preferred him to other claimants. The descendants of Godfrey gradually decayed in power after the death of Alexander, yet still held the lands of North Uist. Allan is said to have fought at the Battle of Harlaw in 1411, as did his brothers Donald and Dugald (who was slain). According to Macdonald and Macdonald, Allan likely died sometime between 1428 and 1430 at Castle Tioram and was buried at <b>Relig</b> Odhráin. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Roderick.|$|E

The MS History of the Mackintoshes states that Roderick collected a band of men [...] "accustomed to live by rapine, fell upon Inverness, pillages and burnt the houses". In 1431, Roderick fought under Donald Balloch against the king's troops at Lochaber. In 1455, {{he was part of}} a Macdonald failed raid on Sutherland, in which the History of Clanranald states that while the Macdonalds were ultimately defeated in the engagement, Roderick succeeded in saving most of his men and returned to Castle Tioram. In 1469, the John II, Lord of the Isles granted to his half-brother Hugh of Sleat, much of the lands that were originally held by Ranald. These included the 30 merklands of Skirbough in South Uist, the 12 merklands of Benbecula, and the 60 merklands of North Uist. It also appears the Hugh of Sleat additionally held 24 merklands in Arisaig and 21 merklands in Eigg.

On John's death, Reginald's younger half-brother, Donald, succeeded to the lordship of the isles and chiefship of Clan Donald. Reginald died in 1386 at Castle Tioram and was buried at <b>Relig</b> Odhráin on Iona. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Allan. According to the family seanachie MacVuirich, Reginald's brother Godfrey took possession of the former Clann Ruaidhrí lands of Uist and those on the mainland, leaving Reginald's sons the lands in Lochaber.The era from Reginald down to his great-grandson Allan, son of Roderick, {{is by far the most}} obscure in the history of the clan. From the years 1372-1495, no charters of the family exist and it is impossible to know for certain exactly what territories it possessed. The earliest document to shed some light on this era is a charter granted by James V to John Moidartach in 1531. It states that the lands granted had been held by his grandfather, Allan, son of Roderick, and his predecessors. The lands mentioned were the 27 merklands of Moidart, the 30 merklands of Arisaig, 21 merklands in Eigg, and the 30 merklands of Skirhough, in South Uist. According to Angus and Archibald Macdonald, it seems likely that this mere fragment of Ranald's original lands was all that the senior branch of Reginald's descendants had left by the time of Allan, 2nd of Clanranald.|$|E

HYPOTHESES Within 40 years of state socialism, the number of church members in Eastern Germany declined from more than 90 percent o less than 30 percent. When the socialist regime collapsed in 1990, 32 percent of East Germans tated that they believed in God, 54 percent indicated they were atheists, and 14 per-cent could not decide whether or not they believed in God (Institut fª Demoskopie 1990 :Table 6). Such a high degree of secularization is an exception even in secular Europe. Itis not reached by any western European country and is similar only to the degree of secularization i Estonia or the Czech Republic. Many therefore expected that after the demise of state socialism the liberalization of the political conditions in Eastern Germany would lead to a renewed upswing in church life, since most church members had only relin-quished their membership under political duress (K 6 cher 1990 : 25).

Although Hussein is now best known for being deposed {{at the hands of the}} U.

During Hussein's rein, Iraq entered into several wars with its neighbors over regional power struggles, border disputes, oil rights, and fears of an Iranian- led uprising among Iraq's suppressed Shia majority. Hussein and his tight circle of government elites were Sunni. i The fallout from the wars resonates today. Hussein not only waged wars against his neighbors, but he also ordered harsh treatment and in some cases attacks against his own populace.
