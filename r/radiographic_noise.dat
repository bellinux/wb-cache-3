Global features from the radiographs were first identified. From this approximate region, local regions of the spine curvature were iteratively filtered using diffusion and shock filters to enhance the boundaries of each vertebral body from <b>radiographic</b> <b>noise.</b> The spine curve going through the centroid of the vertebral bodies was successively identified for clinical classification of spinal deformities...|$|E
40|$|When {{the power}} {{spectrum}} of <b>radiographic</b> <b>noise</b> is estimated from scans obtained with a microdensitometer {{equipped with a}} rectangular slit, a bias is present due to the finite length of this slit. A method to correct for this bias was developed and was tested on both a simulated and a measured spectrum. No bias remains with our method, in situations where a conventional method shows a significantly biased result. Good agreement was found with the synthesized slit method, described by Sandrik and Wagne...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the addition {{and benefits of}} an improved detector model and a <b>radiographic</b> <b>noise</b> model to a previously developed mathematical model of a specific radiographic system. The model intentions are to simulate realistic synthetic radiographs of thin laser welded titanium welds and {{to act as an}} X-ray projection kernel in an image analysis algorithm. Both these objectives put high demands on low calculation time and to accomplish this a number of simplifications have been done. An evaluation of the tradeoff when using the simplifications is essential and simulations of specific geometries and the radiographic inspection procedure are used for this purpose. As verification the simulated radiographs are compared to real digital radiographs relevant for the proposed applications...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{radiography}} is a {{non-destructive inspection}} (NDI) process widely {{used for the}} detection of cracks and damage in aircraft structures. However a significant limitation is that it relies on visual assessment by the operator for identification of defects from the radiographic image. Digital radiography allows all the benefits of producing significant increases in magnification and image clarity, as well as efficient management of digital images. Image enhancement allows more accurate interpretation of digital radiography indications. In this paper, image enhancement methods are investigated for NDI inspection of the aircraft. The wavelet thresholding technique is applied to reduce the <b>radiographic</b> image <b>noise.</b> The contrast and brightness of the image is adjusted using gamma correction and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization to enhance perception of defects. These are used to eliminate noise and background artifacts and to smooth sharp edges, but also tend to remove some of the detail in small objects. 1...|$|R
40|$|Two {{measures}} (not independent) of {{radiographic image}} quality are contrast and spatial frequency response. At normal <b>radiographic</b> exposure levels, <b>noise</b> {{is not a}} significant factor in evaluating these parameters. However, when the photon fluence on the detector is less than 100 photons/pixel, the statistical noise in the image significantly degrades the image contrast. This paper presents a method of characterizing the image quality that utilizes both contrast and noise by calculating the net information content of the image (in bits) using the image entropy. An algorithm for calculating information content (IC) is developed and results are presented for simulated radiographs as various radiographic parameters are varied. This Mathematica code is listed in the Appendix. A copper step wedge is radiographed and the actual IC is measured for all the steps which are taken two at a time. This experimental data is compared to simulated results with good agreement. A companion report will show how varying such radiographic parameters as x-ray energy and total dose affect the IC of the image...|$|R
40|$|The efﬁcacy of Image guided {{radiation}} therapy (IGRT) systems relies on accurately extracting, modeling and predicting tumor movement with imaging techniques. This thesis investigates two key {{problems associated with}} such systems: motion modeling and image processing. For thoracic and upper abdominal tumors, respiratory motion is the dominant factor for tumor movement. We have studied several special structured time series analysis techniques to incorporate the semi-periodicity characteristics of respiratory motion. The proposed methods are robust towards large variations among fractions and populations; the algorithms perform stably {{in the presence of}} sparse <b>radiographic</b> observations with <b>noise.</b> We have proposed a subspace projection method to quantitatively evaluate the semi-periodicity of a given observation trace; a nonparametric local regression approach for real-time prediction of respiratory motion; a state augmentation scheme to model hysteresis; and an ellipse tracking algorithm to estimate the trend of respiratory motion in real time. For image processing, we have focused on designing regularizations to account for prior information in image registration problems. We investigated a penalty function design that accommodates tissue-type-dependent elasticity information. We studied a class of discontinuity preserving regularizers that yield smooth deformation estimates in most regions, yet allow discontinuities supported by data. We have further proposed a discriminate regularizer that preserves shear discontinuity, but discourages folding or vacuum generating ﬂows. In addition, we have initiated a preliminary principled study on the fundamental performance limit of image registration problems. We proposed a statistical generative model to account for noise effect in both source and target images, and investigated the approximate performance of the maximum-likelihood estimator corresponding to the generative model and the commonly adopted M-estimator. A simple example suggests that the approximation is reasonably accurate. Our studies in both time series analysis and image registration constitute essential building-blocks for clinical applications such as adaptive treatment. Besides their theoretical interests, it is our sincere hope that with further justiﬁcations, the proposed techniques would realize its clinical value, and {{improve the quality of life}} for patients...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} if physical {{measures of}} noise predict image quality at {{high and low}} noise levels. Method: Twenty-four images were acquired on a DR system using a Pehamed DIGRAD phantom at three kVp settings (60, 70 and 81) {{across a range of}} mAs values. The image acquisition setup consisted of 14 cm of PMMA slabs with the phantom placed in the middle at 120 cm SID. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and Contrast-to- noise ratio (CNR) were calculated for each of the images using ImageJ software and 14 observers performed image scoring. Images were scored according to the observer`s evaluation of objects visualized within the phantom. Results: The R 2 values of the non-linear relationship between objective visibility score and CNR (60 kVp R 2 = 0. 902; 70 Kvp R 2 = 0. 913; 80 kVp R 2 = 0. 757) demonstrate a better fit for all 3 kVp settings than the linear R 2 values. As CNR increases for all kVp settings the Object Visibility also increases. The largest increase for SNR at low exposure values (up to 2 mGy) is observed at 60 kVp, when compared with 70 or 81 kVp. CNR response to exposure is similar. Pearson r was calculated to assess the correlation between Score, OV, SNR and CNR. None of the correlations reached a level of statistical significance (p > 0. 01). Conclusion: For object visibility and SNR, tube potential variations {{may play a role in}} object visibility. Higher energy X-ray beam settings give lower SNR but higher object visibility. Object visibility and CNR at all three tube potentials are similar, resulting in a strong positive relationship between CNR and object visibility score. At low doses the impact of <b>radiographic</b> <b>noise</b> does not have a strong influence on object visibility scores because in noisy images objects could still be identified...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} various air gaps on {{computed}} radiographic musculoskeletal images was investigated using a knee phantom. Scatter to primary radiation ratios were measured using the beam stop method at air gaps ranging from 0 to 30 in. (0 – 762 -mm). Bony trabecular sharpness, line pair resolution, quantum mottle and visualization of low-contrast beads {{in the soft}} tissues were evaluated. A significant reduction of scatter to primary radiation ratio, from a value of almost 1 at table top to about 0. 4 at 10 -in. (254 -mm) air gap and about 0. 2 at 25 -in. (635 -mm) air gap placement of the computed radiography (CR) imaging plate, was obtained. A progressive improvement in bony trabecular sharpness and line pair resolution, compared with the table top and Bucky images was observed on 10 -in. (254 -mm) through 25 -in. (635 -mm) air gap images. Sharpness of the bony trabeculae and line pair resolution were best on the 25 -in. (635 -mm) air gap images. The skin entrance radiation dose {{does not have to}} be increased for air gap digital radiography. The <b>radiographic</b> <b>noise</b> or quantum mottle is highest on the Bucky image, higher on air gap images and minimal on the table top images, despite a high scatter to primary radiation ratio at the table top. The lower quantum mottle on the table top images allowed for maximal visualization of low contrast densities in the soft tissues. Air gap radiography further improves musculoskeletal computed imaging by reducing the scatter to primary radiation ratio without an increase in the skin entrance dose. For significant reduction of the scatter to primary radiation ratio and best evaluation of line pair spatial resolution and bony trabeculae, a 25 -in. (635 -mm) air gap with digital radiography would be optimal. For evaluation of low contrast densities in the soft tissues, table top placement would be the technique of choice...|$|E
40|$|Bone age {{assessment}} {{is a method}} of assigning a level of biological maturity to a child. It is usually performed either by comparing an x-ray of a child's left hand and wrist with an atlas of known bones, or by analysing specific features of bones such as ratios of width to height, or the degree of overlap with other bones. Both methods of assessment are labour intensive and prone to both inter- and intra-observer variability. This is motivation for developing a computerised method of bone age assessment. The majority {{of research and development}} on computerised bone age assessment has focussed on analysing the bones of the hand. The wrist bones, especially the carpal bones, have received far less attention and have only been analysed in young children in which there is clear separation of the bones. An argument is presented that the evidence for excluding the carpal bones from computerised bone age {{assessment is}} weak and that research is required to identify the role of carpal bones in the computerised assessment of bone age for children over eight years of age. Computerised analysis of the carpal bones in older children is a difficult computer vision problem plagued by <b>radiographic</b> <b>noise,</b> poor image contrast, and especially poor definition of bone contours. Traditional image processing methods such as region growing fail and even the very successful Canny linear edge detector can only find the simplest of bone edges in these images. The field of partial differential equation-based image processing provides some possible solutions to this problem, {{such as the use of}} active contour models to impose constraints upon the contour continuity. However, many of these methods require regularisation to achieve unique and stable solutions. An important part of this regularisation is image denoising. Image denoising was approached through development of a noise model for the Kodak computed radiography system, estimation of noise parameters using a robust estimator of noise per pixel intensity bin, and incorporation of the noise model into a denoising method based on oriented Laplacians. The results for this approach only showed a marginal improvement when using the signal-dependent noise model, although this likely reflects how the noise characteristics were incorporated into the anisotropic diffusion method, rather than the principle of this approach. Even without the signal-dependent noise term the oriented Laplacians denoising of the hand-wrist radiographs was very effective at removing noise and preserving edges...|$|E
40|$|Advance {{in medical}} imaging {{technologies}} enables various imaging modalities such as ultrasound, MRI 	(magnetic resonance imaging), PET (positron emission tomography) and CT (computed tomography) to be 	used in medical diagnosis. However, their imaging performance {{is limited by}} various constraints. That causes 	degradation of the medical image quality. Especially, the hazard associated with X-ray exposure is greater for 	 3 D-CT methods such as MDCT (multi-detector row computed tomography) than for conventional CT. The 	best method of mitigating this hazard is to lower the X-ray dose level. However, the <b>radiographic</b> <b>noise,</b> i. e., 	quantum noise, in MDCT images increases when radiation exposure is reduced. Therefore, {{there is a strong}} 	desire to reduce patient dose and to improve image quality by increasing spatial resolution and decreasing 	quantum noise in MDCT modality. 	Although various image improvement and evaluation methods have been developed, they all focused on 	improving the image quality in a whole image or in an entire 3 D dataset. Their performance is not enough for 	the radiologists who should not miss the small tumors whose size is around 5 mm and preferably down to 2 	mm. To overcome these difficulties, this thesis proposes several linear and non-linear filtering methods to 	enhance the low-dose MDCT images according to the size and local voxel value distribution of the small 	regions which are suspected of tumors. 	Firstly, 3 D weighted average filter is designed to enhance the low-dose MDCT images. In order to retain 	the subtle characteristics of the small tumors, the center weight of the 3 D weighted average filter is given a large 	value. The other weights decrease with the increasing of the radius away {{from the center of the}} filter template. 	However, the 3 D weighted average filter is a linear filter. Therefore, edges and subtle structure of 	parenchyma are prone to be blurred to some degree after filtering. To alleviate this limitation, 3 D non-linear 	diffusion-based filter is designed to reduce the quantum noise as well as to maintain the subtle structure of the 	small tumors and the parenchyma. Experimental results show that the edges of the tumors remain well while 	the noise level has been lowered by this diffusion type filter. However, the point noises of the images are not be 	removed well, since this diffusion type filtering method can not distinguish noise candidates from the voxels 	with large gradients. Therefore a combination filter consisting of 3 D weighted average filter and 3 D non-linear 	diffusion based filter are proposed. 	To improve the quality of low-dose clinical MDCT images degraded by the quantum noise, a new 3 D 	adaptive median filter with local average (3 D AMLA) is also proposed. This new method differs from 	approaches in the literature since not only it is designed based on the size of the small tumors but also this 	scheme detects and replaces the noise candidates with local averaging according to the distribution of voxel 	value adaptively. In this study, the 2 D adaptive median filter (AM) is extended to 3 D AM to show the 	effectiveness of 3 D filtering, firstly. Then adaptive local averaging strategy is introduced to this 3 D AM. That is 	 3 D AMLA. The 2 D AM, 3 D AM and 3 D AMLA are applied to 80 -, 60 -, 40 - and 20 %-dose low-dose datasets. 	Image quality is assessed by visual evaluation, voxel value profiles and several quantitative methods, 	including newly proposed entropy of correlation (EC) and mutual information and correlation (MIC) which are 	developed according to the graininess correlation of the little intro-hepatic tumors in directions of X, Y and Z axes. Experimental results show the high performance of both the filtering and the evaluating methods and 	X-ray dose level can be reduced to a large degree by applying the 3 D AMLA and the combination filter...|$|E
