However, after listening to the song, fans tried calling the number with different area codes, and one of them, 912, {{turned out to be}} the number of a retired pastor from Statesboro, Georgia, named J.D. Turner. He claims to have received more than twenty calls a day from Keys' fans in the weeks after the song's release. This led to a $95 phone bill resulting from charges associated with the *69 last-call <b>return</b> <b>option,</b> which he used to track down each caller. Turner has declined to change his number, having held it for fourteen years before the song's release.

In ideal circumstances, the saddle is tried {{on the horse}} prior to purchase, or is purchased with a <b>return</b> <b>option</b> {{if it does not}} fit. When saddle shopping, or if having a saddle custom-made, one method of sizing the horse is known as a [...] "wither tracing." [...] To create this, an artist's flexicurve or a piece of coat hanger wire is placed up over the withers about two inches behind the horse's shoulder blade, then shaped to fit across the withers. The shape is then traced onto heavy paper or cardboard. An average horse can be fitted with just this measurement by comparing the angle of the wither tracing to the angle of the piping at the front arch of the saddle. However, horses with an unusual shape are measured in three locations, the second measurement approximately two inches behind the first one, and the last measurement nine inches behind the withers. Often for accurate measurements, a professional saddle fitter may need to be consulted.|$|E

The paper examines particularly the coordination problem when the supplier has the opportunity to realise a limited amount of overstock items at a higher price than the retailer at midlife. In this paper <b>return</b> <b>options</b> are introduced in the channel, where an option gives the holder the right to return a product at midlife in exchange for a pre-specified amount of money. It is shown that the supplier must, to achieve coordination, determine one exercise price of the <b>options</b> and two <b>return</b> rebates, where the latter guarantee the retailer an amount of money for each product returned, at midlife and end-of-life, without a corresponding option. Conditions for pricing of <b>return</b> <b>options</b> and conditions for wholesale prices are derived as well. A numerical study shows that the supplier is better off when the number of <b>return</b> <b>options</b> increases. The numerical study also shows that the coordinating option price is relatively unaffected by the return rebate in the second period, but is more dependent on the exercise price and return rebate at midlife, which in turn are dependent on the production costs.

40|$|AbstractFor {{a growing}} number of researchers, {{international}} migration has particularly undergone a change in recent decades. In 2006, the recently released Report of the General Secretary of the United Nations on International Migration and Development suggested a “new era of mobility” characterized in part by a greater degree of non-permanent, or circular migration. Although the impact of circular migration on development is far from being determined, a current literature review suggests a growing optimism about its potential of development. This optimism comes mainly from the erosion of the migration structure traditionally polarized in which emigrants are seen as “loss” for the country of origin (Southern country) and immigrants are therefore “won” by the country of destination (Northern country), entering through a direct effect of brain drain i. e. the depreciation of human capital and consequently the reduction of the economic growth of developing countries. In fact, today, emigrants and their descendants are key players in the development agenda of a number of developing countries. In addition to the induced effect of brain drain as a stimulus to domestic education, the value of emigrants comes not only from what they can contribute from far (diaspora option), but also that what they can cause through their return to their country of origin (<b>return</b> <b>option).</b> Thus, in the context of circular migration, there is a brain drain followed by a brain gain (feedback effect) in which we find both the diaspora option and especially the <b>return</b> <b>option,</b> from which the economies of developing countries can benefit in terms of economic growth through technology transfer of their nationals in the North, including on the one hand remittances, links with international trade and foreign direct investment and diaspora networks (diaspora option), {{and on the other hand}} the physical return of nationals (<b>return</b> <b>option)</b> ...|$|E

The option value of having an MBG is negatively correlated with the likelihood of product fit and {{with the opportunity to}} test the product before purchase, and positively correlated with price and contract duration. Simulation of our model reveals that when customers are highly heterogeneous in their product valuation and probability of need-fit, and if return costs are low, an unbundled MBG policy is optimal. When customers have high likelihood of fit or return costs are excessive, no MBG is the best policy. When customers have small variance in product valuation, but vary greatly in likelihood of product fit, the retailer may prefer to offer a bundled MBG contract, extracting consumer surplus by charging a price close to the valuation level...|$|E
40|$|When a firm {{allows the}} return of {{previously}} purchased merchandise, it provides customers with an option that has measurable value. Whereas the option to return merchandise leads {{to an increase in}} gross revenue, it also creates additional costs. Selecting an optimal return policy requires balancing both demand and cost implications. In this paper, we develop a structural model of a consumer's decision to purchase and return an item that nests extant choice models as a special case. The model enables a firm to both measure the value to consumers of the <b>return</b> <b>option</b> and balance {{the costs and benefits of}} different return policies. We apply the model to a sample of data provided by a mail-order catalog company. We find considerable variation in the value of returns across customers and categories. When the option value is large, there are large increases in demand. For example, the option to return women's footwear is worth an average of more than $ 15 per purchase to customers and increases average purchase rates by more than 50 %.

30|$|Direct costs include {{administrative}} and processing costs [2]. Additional expenses occur if the merchandise is received in a deteriorated condition. In these cases, retailers must bear {{the costs of}} new packaging, reconditioning, value depreciation, and waste disposal. In the following, these costs {{are referred to as}} disposition costs. Returns caused by poor customer experiences, such as poor fulfillment or product quality, may indirectly harm satisfaction as well as loyalty, weaken the retailer’s reputation, and decrease the customer’s lifetime value [2, 3, 4]. Indirect costs represent potential damages to customer relations and are therefore difficult to quantify. These costs are closely related to but {{should not be confused with}} the consumer’s return effort, which is occasionally referred to as “hassle costs” [e.g., 5, 6]. Consumers choose the <b>return</b> <b>option</b> if they perceive the purchase price minus the transaction costs to be larger than the remaining product value after the return period [6, 7]. Transaction costs can involve hassles such as compromising one’s free time and psychological well-being. They can also take the form of restocking fees or excluding shipping costs from reimbursement [5, 8]. Greater hassle increases the perceived transaction costs, which, on the one hand, may damage customer satisfaction but, on the other hand, leads to more customers retaining their purchases instead of sending them back [3]. Consequently, the customer’s hassle costs reduce the retailer’s direct costs but raise the indirect return costs.|$|E

ARFIMA and HAR models can capture the long-memory property and ARFIMAX and HARX models can also capture the asymmetry in volatility depending on the sign of previous day's <b>return.</b> <b>Option</b> prices are derived under the assumption of risk-neutrality.

Main results using the Nikkei 225 stock index and its put options prices are: (1) ARFIMAX model with daily realized volatility performs best, (2) the Hansen and Lunde (2005 a) adjustment without using overnight and lunch-time returns can improve the performance, (3) if the Hansen and Lunde (2005 a), which also plays a role to remove the bias caused by the microstructure noise by setting the sample mean of realized volatility equal to the sample variance of daily returns, is used, the other methods for taking account of microstructure noise do not necessarily improve the performance and (4) the Duan (1995) method does not improve the performance compared with assuming the risk neutrality. microstructure noise, Nikkei 225 stock index, non-trading hours, option pricing, realized volatility...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Although {{there has}} been a rapid growth in online apparel sales and online apparel {{shopping}} during the last several years, consumers still have concerns when they purchase apparel products online (ComScore, 2007; Dunne & Lusch, 2005; ITFacts E-commerce, 2007). From the online apparel shoppers’ perspective, online apparel shopping involves a considerable level of risk because they cannot inspect and try on apparel products before the purchase. If consumers are not satisfied with the fit, color, or quality of the product after it is delivered, they will most likely want to return the product (Taylor & Cosenza, 2000). The research question of the present study is why some dissatisfied consumers decide to continue online shopping and why others decide to discontinue online shopping when presented with an unsatisfactory online shopping and return experience. Based on the concepts of distributive, procedural, and informational justice, this study examined the direct effect of compensation on distributive justice, the direct effect of efficient return procedures on procedural justice, and the direct effect of information availability of return on informational justice, and the direct effects of perceived distributive, procedural, and informational justice on post-recovery satisfaction. Indirect effects on post-purchase intentions after an unsatisfactory online apparel shopping and return experience were also examined. Furthermore, the present study examined the moderating effect of perceived seriousness of product failure on the relationship between compensation and distributive justice, the relationship between efficient return procedure and procedural justice, and the relationship between information availability for return and informational justice. The moderating effects of shopping orientations, perceived performance risk, and previous experience with online apparel shopping on the relationships between three types of perceived justice and post-recovery satisfaction, and on the relationship between post-recovery satisfaction and post-purchase intentions were also examined. The present study employed a combined experimental and a survey-based method. For the experiments, five scenarios were developed using projective technique. The convenience sampling was conducted. 148 students at Oregon State University participated. Subjects read a scenario in the third person perspective about a consumer returning a product. They were then asked to assess evaluative criteria including distributive justice, procedural justice, informational justice, post-recovery satisfaction, post-purchase intentions, perceived seriousness of product failure, convenience shopping orientation, economic shopping orientation, recreational shopping orientation, perceived performance risk, and previous experience with online apparel shopping. The findings indicated that participants who read a scenario in which a consumer received higher levels of distributive, procedural, and informational justices indicated the consumer would be more satisfied with the service recovery and would develop positive post-purchase intentions. In other words, consumers who had an unsatisfactory online apparel shopping and return experience were perceived as being willing to develop positive post-purchase intentions from the same online store if the e-retailer provided high levels of post-recoveries such as free return shipping fee, both store <b>return</b> <b>option</b> and mail <b>return</b> <b>option,</b> and information availability about return shipping fee. The results supported that the concepts of distributive, procedural, and informational justice may be applicable for understanding consumers who had an unsatisfactory online apparel shopping and return experience. The findings have managerial implications for e-return policies and return procedures. If e-retailers provide high levels of service recoveries with return policies and return procedures in which consumers perceive fair, those consumers may be satisfied with those return policies and return procedures, and then are likely to repurchase apparel products from the same online apparel store. Future research needs to examine the impacts of other factors such merchandise credit, cash refunds, and online help options on perceived justice...|$|E
