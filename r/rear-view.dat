5|$|In {{the first}} three seasons, between Tony leaving the tunnel and passing through the toll plaza, the show had {{a shot of the}} World Trade Center towers in Tony's <b>rear-view</b> mirror. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, this shot was removed and {{replaced}} with a more generic shot, beginning with the show's fourth season.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{just two}} years before the release of the VE Commodore, Holden {{unveiled}} the Torana TT36 concept car at the Australian International Motor Show in Sydney. The TT36 served as a preview of the VE and allowed Holden to gauge public reaction to its styling. Much of the Torana's styling drew on the essence of the VE's design. Some production-ready components even carried over from the TT36 including the steering wheel, the window and <b>rear-view</b> mirror switch cluster and the handbrake lever.|$|E
5|$|The album cover, {{photographed by}} Ross Kirton, is a <b>rear-view</b> shot of Alison against a sparkly black background, {{looking over her}} {{shoulder}} while covering her breast with her hand. The regular edition cover shows her from the waist up, whereas the US special edition shows the cover art in its entirety, with Alison wearing a long plume of peacock feathers and golden platform shoes. In late 2005, the album ranked number eight on the annual Best Art Vinyl poll.|$|E
5|$|In-game screen {{shows the}} cockpit view split between top half for plane's front view and bottom half for plane's instrumentation. The control panel shows planes crucial data, {{including}} speed, altitude, thrust, fuel, roll/pitch indicators and a compass. The panel {{also features a}} radar that provided an overview of important nearby objects. An onboard screen displays various flight information and warning messages, and features a speech synthesizer that occasionally announces dangers, such as approaching enemies or missile attacks. Finally, a small <b>rear-view</b> camera allows the player to observe enemies and missiles on their tail. The game also features a two player mode, where one player flies the plane and the other aims and fires the guns.|$|E
5|$|Mirrors reflect Marion as she packs, {{her eyes}} as she checks the <b>rear-view</b> mirror, her face in the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by {{reflecting}} Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour {{can be seen as a}} foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|Ridge Racer Revolution was {{developed}} over eight months {{by a team}} of more than twenty people, most of whom joined just for Ridge Racer Revolution. The biggest difficulties were the link-up mode, <b>rear-view</b> mirror, and running the game at high speeds. Each member had worked on other console games, and they commented that the graphics detail showed the improvements in skill and technique. The team wanted players to enjoy a more in-depth game than the original, so rather than develop a port of Ridge Racer 2, as many features as possible were added. The early designs for the new courses were made in a 'free run' programme, and used to see how fast the cars went. The <b>rear-view</b> mirror was added primarily with the two player link-up mode in mind. The music was mostly taken from Ridge Racer 2, and as a result, the sound was finished more quickly than the game. Soundtrack composition involved four musicians, who composed for Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer 2, and Rave Racer. The team kept exploring the PlayStation's capabilities to solve the high speed problem, although were confident it was possible. The designer, Hiroyuki Onada, commented that designing an original course was a challenge, and director Kazumi Mizuno believed that graphics quality would be degraded with a split-screen multiplayer mode, so the team decided to focus on the PlayStation's link-up instead.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, an {{intrusive}} {{public works}} inspector (Carter Jahncke) tests {{the air quality}} at the squad room, but insists to an inquisitive Gee that everything is fine. The next day, however, Gee goes upstairs and finds a team wearing protective respirator suits removing hazardous asbestos from the wall. Gee angrily confronts Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) for not informing the detectives about the work, and demands it be stopped until precautionary medical checks can be conducted. Barnfather and Granger insist the removal work is safe, but give in when Gee threatens {{to go to the}} media. Meanwhile, Lewis (Clark Johnson) brags repeatedly to Crosetti (Jon Polito) about his new Ford FE V8 engine and the car he plans to build. Crosetti feigns disinterest, but the next day presents Lewis with a <b>rear-view</b> mirror as a gift.|$|E
5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic <b>rear-view</b> mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect, with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich steel body panels.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system remains}} unchanged from Ridge Racer, the checkpoint and time limit system remain the same; {{running out of}} time ends the race and passing through checkpoints grants additional time, although the car drifting is more like Ridge Racer 2. The player drives using automatic transmission or manual transmission. Ridge Racer Revolution supports Namco's NeGcon controller, and adds a <b>rear-view</b> mirror when using the in-car view. The game consists of three courses: 'Novice', 'Intermediate' (also called 'Advanced'), and 'Expert', each having different sections opened, and incorporates modes from the original game; Race, against eleven opponents, and Time Trial, against one. Ridge Racer Revolution adds a mode: Free Run, in which there are no other cars and the player practises driving. There is no lap limit. How fast the cars run depends on which speed grade is used, selectable in Free Run, and can be unlocked for Race. It is not available in Time Trial. A new feature is the option to select the time of day in which the race takes place, although this is not available {{at the start of the}} game. Ridge Racer Revolution features a two-player link-up mode which allows the players access to the original Ridge Racers courses known as 'Special 1' and 'Special 2'. There are two modes in two-player link-up: Race, identical to its single-player counterpart, and Versus, where only the players race against each other. Versus features a handicap option, increasing the speed of the trailing car.|$|E
25|$|That {{may seem}} {{easy to do}} when one looks through an always-clean, <b>rear-view</b> mirror. Unfortunately, however, it's the {{windshield}} through which investors must peer, and that glass is invariably fogged.|$|E
25|$|Some {{parts are}} also much simpler {{than those of}} its competitors. For example, <b>rear-view</b> mirrors are {{symmetrical}} {{and can be used}} {{on either side of the}} car, the windshield is flatter than usual, and the dashboard is a single injection-molded piece.|$|E
25|$|On Wednesday 16 August 2006, {{the first}} {{air-conditioned}} 42-seat <b>rear-view</b> Northerner/Overlander car and its air-conditioned 49-seat day car running mate, {{were taken to}} Hutt Workshops and stored, their bogies went under the ex-British Rail cars for the Wairarapa Connection.|$|E
25|$|Other {{structural}} changes included flush riveting for the fuselage, introduced in mid-1943. A streamlined round <b>rear-view</b> mirror, with a bullet-shaped fairing replaced the rectangular version. On new production Mk IXs the small, teardrop shaped identification light behind the radio mast was removed.|$|E
25|$|The stretch nylon bikini briefs and bras which complemented the {{adolescent}} boutique fashions of the 1960s also allowed those to be minimal. Women {{on the beaches}} of Rio de Janeiro and Saint-Tropez went even further, forgoing all <b>rear-view</b> coverage {{to show off their}} thongs.|$|E
25|$|The past went that-a-way. When {{faced with}} a totally new {{situation}} we tend always to attach ourselves to the objects, to {{the flavor of the}} most recent past. We look at the present through a <b>rear-view</b> mirror. We march backward into the future. Suburbia lives imaginatively in Bonanza-land.|$|E
25|$|The Marlin {{emphasized}} the stretched-out hardtop (pillar-less) roofline {{that followed the}} contemporary styling vogue. Automobile Quarterly magazine thought the car very ugly and expressed dislike for the inadequacy of the <b>rear-view</b> window, {{the positions of the}} steering-wheel and stoplights, the softness of the front seats, and the design of the pedals.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a version}} of Lexus GS 300h for European market, with 2.5-liter Atkinson cycle four-cylinder engine (181PS), two {{electric}} motors, a hard-drive navigation system with a 12.3-inch Monitor and Lexus Connected Services, a premium audio system, DVD player and <b>rear-view</b> camera with a monitor, among other features. The vehicle went on sale in 2014-01-11.|$|E
25|$|The {{cabin was}} fitted with California Walnut wood trim {{on the front}} dashboard, center console, and doors as well as {{exterior}} puddle lamps, floor-well lighting, chrome door handles, an electric rear sunblind, and <b>rear-view</b> mirrors that would automatically tilt downward in reverse gear. Available options, including a power rear sunshade, rain-sensing windshield wipers, a DVD-based navigation system, and a Mark Levinson premium stereo system, were similar to features on the flagship LS 430 sedan.|$|E
25|$|During the {{transition}} period, the former Vice-Regal car turned Southerner buffet car was refitted in 1993 with shorter buffet counter and 24 seats {{of the type}} designed by Addington Workshops, arranged alcove-style to replace the long counter and 20 associated stools and was returned to the NIMT. Also, the TranzAlpine <b>rear-view</b> car had seats and tables removed, replaced by 39 seats of the same design as the refurbished Wairarapa cars, arranged forward-facing.|$|E
25|$|Single lenses have {{a variety}} of {{applications}} including photographic lenses, corrective lenses, and magnifying glasses while single mirrors are used in parabolic reflectors and <b>rear-view</b> mirrors. Combining a number of mirrors, prisms, and lenses produces compound optical instruments which have practical uses. For example, a periscope is simply two plane mirrors aligned to allow for viewing around obstructions. The most famous compound optical instruments in science are the microscope and the telescope which were both invented by the Dutch in the late 16th century.|$|E
25|$|The Japan model {{included}} a <b>rear-view</b> monitor which displays {{an image of}} the area {{at the rear of the}} vehicle while backing up to reduce the burden on the driver while parking. Also, the optional Intelligent Parking Assist system supports steering operations when parallel parking and backing into a parking space. Ultrasonic sensors installed on the front of the vehicle detect other parked vehicles and, based on the results, estimate the physical dimensions of a vacant parking space and set the target parking position.|$|E
25|$|PlayStation Portable {{can connect}} with PlayStation 3 in many ways, {{including}} in-game connectivity. For example, Formula One Championship Edition, a racing game, was shown at E3 2006 using a PSP as a real-time <b>rear-view</b> mirror. In addition, users {{are able to}} download original PlayStation format games from the PlayStation Store, transfer and play them on PSP as well as PS3 itself. It is also possible to use the Remote Play feature to play these and some PlayStation Network games, remotely on PSP over a network or internet connection.|$|E
25|$|In December 1960, {{after its}} last tax disc expired, Dr. Carr stored the Bugatti {{along with other}} classic cars in a lock up garage in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne. There it {{remained}} unused and untouched until after Carr's death, when it was discovered by Carr's nephew clearing the garage of his uncle's possessions in 2008. 57502 still possessed its original chassis, engine, drive train and body, though it did contain some modifications: bespoke bumpers, <b>rear-view</b> mirrors on the A-pillars, and a luggage rack dating from the Earl Howe ownership, {{as well as a}} Marshall K200 supercharger fitted by a later owner.|$|E
25|$|The LF-C is {{a concept}} car Lexus {{unveiled}} at the 2004 New York Auto Show. This concept featured a retractable hardtop design which allowed for coupe, convertible, targa, or speedster configurations via a four-position glass roof. The designation stands for Lexus Future-Coupe. The LF-C is fitted with a V8 engine and rear-wheel drive. Unique features included a one-touch activation button, crystal LED taillamps, suede bucket seats, a 3D instrument panel, drive-by-wire, and a translucent crystal center console with blue backlighting. The LF-C also featured retractable <b>rear-view</b> cameras in place of side mirrors on the doors and rear bumper.|$|E
25|$|The film's {{score was}} {{composed}} by Don Davis. He noted that mirrors appear {{frequently in the}} film: reflections of the blue and red pills are seen in Morpheus's glasses; Neo's capture by Agents is viewed through the <b>rear-view</b> mirror of Trinity's Triumph Speed Triple motorcycle; Neo observes a broken mirror mending itself; reflections warp as a spoon is bent; the reflection of a helicopter is visible as it approaches a skyscraper. Davis focused on this theme of reflections when creating his score, alternating between sections of the orchestra and attempting to incorporate contrapuntal ideas. Davis' score combines orchestral, choral and synthesizer elements; the balance between these elements varies depending on whether humans or machines are the dominant subject of a given scene.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} sit upright was an {{important}} requirement for test animals in order that another common fatal injury among human victims, decapitation, could be studied. Additionally, {{it was important for}} researchers to be able to determine to what extent cabin design needed to be modified to ensure optimal survival circumstances. For instance, a dashboard with too little padding or padding which was too stiff or too soft would not significantly reduce head injury over a dash with no padding at all. While knobs, levers, and buttons are essential in the operation of a vehicle, which design modifications would best ensure that these elements did not tear or puncture victims in a crash. <b>Rear-view</b> mirror impact is a significant occurrence in a frontal collision; how should a mirror be built so that it is both rigid enough to perform its task and yet of low injury risk if struck.|$|E
25|$|The C.205 was a single-seat, all-metal, {{monoplane}} fighter, {{intended primarily}} as an interceptor but with ground attack and escort capabilities. The long nose housed the DB605 engine which drove a three-blade, constant-speed metal propeller, {{with the main}} fuel tank situated between the engine and the cockpit. The radiator was located under the centre section of the fuselage beneath the cockpit while the short rear section housed the radio equipment, oxygen cylinder and an 80L (20US gal) reserve fuel tank. The wings were made of light aluminium alloys and steel, having two spars and three sections, housing two additional fuel tanks, and the fully retractable wide-set main undercarriage gear. Apart from the all-metal flaps in the inner wing, all the other control surfaces were metal-framed and fabric-covered. Veltros had self-sealing fuel tanks, an armoured seat, and armoured windscreen as standard. The cramped cockpit possessed a limited field-of-view, but some examples were fitted with a <b>rear-view</b> mirror.|$|E
25|$|Police then {{compared}} the orange carpet fibers found on Harrison's {{body to the}} ones in Buell's van, which was {{the same color as}} the one seen in 1982. The <b>rear-view</b> windows were of a different shape, although it was later revealed that they had been replaced. It was later concluded that the fibers on Harrison's body and the carpet in the van were a likely match and records from Sears indicated that Buell had purchased the same type of car seat that was once contained in the bag and box used to conceal the body. Paint found on the jeans near the dump site matched that on the outside of Robert Anthony Buell's residence as well. The jeans themselves were similar to other pairs that he owned. Spray paint in his garage was also matched to some that was present on the box. A fingerprint on plastic concealing Harrison's body did not.|$|E
25|$|The {{video is}} set in a {{colorful}} city and has a futuristic theme to it. The storyline of the video begins with Jordan dropping off her boyfriend at a bus stop, as they appear to be breaking up. She is seen sitting in the backseat of her orange AMC Pacer, and starts to sing the song's first verse, just as the wind begins to pick up, sliding her car and the bus stop, where her boyfriend is at, in opposite directions. Throughout the video, the city moves in motion. It is intercut with other scenes, including Jordan dancing with four other back-up dancers at a swimming pool, a man reading a newspaper while holding a Dalmatian dog by its leash, and also a woman with a few shopping bags. During the car scenes, Jordan sees flashbacks of her boyfriend in the car's <b>rear-view</b> mirror. She later realises that he makes her happy and moves to the driver's seat, to stop the car. Jordan then reverses the car, sending her back to the bus stop.|$|E
25|$|On lap 17, Bird {{attempted}} to overtake López {{heading into the}} first turn, but the two cars made contact in the corner, causing Bird to run wide and fell to sixth after he was passed by Vergne and di Grassi and was placed under pressure by Abt. Bird lost two further positions when Abt and Prost passed him and López fell to fourth when Vergne overtook the higher-placed Virgin car. Di Grassi passed López entering the first corner shortly after. Buemi was 1.3 seconds behind race leader Rosenqvist by the 20th lap but the latter {{was aware of the}} situation and glanced at his <b>rear-view</b> mirrors to ensure he had large enough of an advantage to remain ahead after the pit stop phase. The mandatory pit stop phase for the switch into a second car began on lap 23 when the leading drivers entered the pit lane. After driving out of his team's garage in his second car, Rosenqvist was released into the path of Heidfeld in the other Mahindra car, causing his teammate to swerve to the outside and nearly entered another team's pit gantry. Heidfeld came to a halt without damaging his car. Although he was briefly delayed, Rosenqvist kept the lead. The stewards immediately investigated Rosenqvist for the pit stop release.|$|E

[...] Willie is affected by his experiences, but does not express them, and his family plan to leave the tenement. [...] For the 2006 edition Eisner added an extra page of Willie from a <b>rear-view</b> perspective, looking out from his balcony.|$|E
500|$|After {{the crash}} {{between himself and}} Burti on the first lap, Michael Schumacher said that {{although}} he saw Burti in his <b>rear-view</b> mirrors, {{he did not know}} which line he wanted to take and he could not take avoiding action because of his gear selection problem. Burti said that the accident [...] "looked worse on TV" [...] and that he stated his spin on lap 18 was caused because his left arm was aching from the crash. Coulthard questioned the decision to stop the race by saying: [...] "Accidents or injury off the track is not normally a reason to stop the race. There's lots of races that would have benefited from being red-flagged to give people a show." [...] He also said he felt consistency was needed but accepted that the organisers had the final say on stopping a race. Villeneuve also agreed with Coulthard's view. A spokesman for the FIA confirmed and defended the red-flag decision and they said it was shown to prevent a larger accident. Michelin Motorsport Director Pierre Dupasquier agreed with the FIA's view and stated he was concerned about cars hitting the strands of debris and catching a puncture.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Rear-view</b> mirrors {{are widely}} used in and on {{vehicles}} (such as automobiles, or bicycles), to allow drivers to see other vehicles coming up behind them. [...] On <b>rear-view</b> sunglasses, the left end of the left glass and the right end of the right glass work as mirrors.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{that year}} work had begun on {{rebuilding}} one car as the first air-conditioned [...] "big window" [...] <b>rear-view</b> observation car for the [...] "new" [...] Northerner/Overlander.|$|E
2500|$|Brazil– Brazilian Traffic Law, article 105, {{subheading}} VI, says that, for bicycles, [...] "bells, rear, front, {{sides and}} pedals signaling, and <b>rear-view</b> {{mirror on the}} left" [...] are mandatory. Albeit, nothing is explicitly said about bicycle brakes.|$|E
2500|$|Modifications {{were also}} {{made to the}} suspension, brakes, electrics, 14" [...] wheels and 165HR14 Pirelli Cinturato CA67 tyres, though the car looked {{effectively}} the same. Visible differences were limited to the <b>rear-view</b> mirror repositioned to the door, and badging on the tail, which read [...] "Alfa Romeo" [...] and [...] "iniezione" [...] (injection).|$|E
