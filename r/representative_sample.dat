5|$|An {{alternative}} is to test respondents at the researcher's facility with opening statements or a full-blown mock trial instead of reading a case summary over the telephone. The higher cost of a mock trial allows for a more realistic portrayal of the real trial and (researchers hope) more accurate data. It also provides a better opportunity to question the subjects, {{before and after the}} trial simulation. On the other hand, telephone surveys provide a larger and more <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> of the jury pool. Diamond indicates that since both methods have advantages, SJS practitioners commonly rely on both in the same case.|$|E
5|$|Edward Epstein {{recognized}} in 1969 that the atmosphere {{could not be}} completely described with a single forecast run due to inherent uncertainty, and proposed using an ensemble of stochastic Monte Carlo simulations to produce means and variances {{for the state of}} the atmosphere. Although this early example of an ensemble showed skill, in 1974 Cecil Leith showed that they produced adequate forecasts only when the ensemble probability distribution was a <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> of the probability distribution in the atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce human efforts, there has been {{increasing}} interest in applying active learning for training text classifiers. This paper describes a straightforward active learning heuristic, <b>representative</b> <b>sampling,</b> which explores the clustering structure of ‘uncertain’ documents and identifies the <b>representative</b> <b>samples</b> to query the user opinions, {{for the purpose of}} speeding up the convergence of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Compared with other active learning algorithms, the proposed <b>representative</b> <b>sampling</b> explicitly addresses the problem of selecting more than one unlabeled documents. In an empirical study we compared <b>representative</b> <b>sampling</b> both with random sampling and with SVM active learning. The results demonstrated that <b>representative</b> <b>sampling</b> offers excellent learning performance with fewer labeled documents and thus can reduce human efforts in text classification tasks...|$|R

40|$|Deciding on {{appropriate}} <b>sampling</b> {{to obtain}} <b>representative</b> <b>samples</b> of behavior is important but not straightforward, because the relative {{duration of the}} target behavior may affect its observation in a given sampling interval. Work-sampling methods, which offer a way to adjust the frequency of sampling according to a priori or ongoing estimates of the behavior to achieve a preselected level of representativeness, may provide a solution. Full-week observations of 7 behaviors were conducted for 3 students with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities. Work-sampling methods were used to select momentary time samples from the full time-of-interest, which produced <b>representative</b> <b>samples.</b> However, work sampling required impractically high numbers of time <b>samples</b> to obtain <b>representative</b> <b>samples.</b> More practical momentary time <b>samples</b> produced less <b>representative</b> <b>samples,</b> particularly for low-duration behaviors. The utility and limits of worksampling methods for applied behavior analysis are discussed...|$|R
5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what the {{researcher}} intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative and qualitative methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency.|$|E
5|$|The term Rosetta stone {{has been}} used idiomatically to {{represent}} a crucial key {{in the process of}} decryption of encoded information, especially when a small but <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> is recognised as the clue to understanding a larger whole.

Another use of the phrase is found in H. G. Wells' 1933 novel The Shape of Things to Come, where the protagonist finds a manuscript written in shorthand that provides a key to understanding additional scattered material that is sketched out in both longhand and on typewriter.|$|E

40|$|Marketers often give {{consumers}} {{samples of}} products before consumers make decisions. However, in the marketplace, samples can be offered {{in many different}} forms. For example, to promote a cake, marketers could provide {{a slice of the}} cake or a mini version of the cake. To advocate for a software package, marketers could provide either a trial version with full features but for a limited time only, or a trial version with limited features but for a longer time period. Are all samples created equal? While previous literature has mainly focused on the general effect of samples, in this dissertation I examine how different types of sampling experiences influence consumer responses to target products. Particularly, I focus on how <b>representative</b> <b>samples</b> are of their target products, as it relates to how fundamentally consumers recognize and understand products. Normatively, high <b>representative</b> <b>samples</b> (e. g., a mini cake) should be more effective than low <b>representative</b> <b>samples</b> (e. g., a slice of a cake) in promoting target products, as high representativeness eases perceived uncertainty about target products. However, counter-intuitively, across a series of online and field experiments, I find that low <b>representative</b> <b>samples</b> actually lead to more favorable responses to target products as compared to high <b>representative</b> <b>samples.</b> The effect of sample representativeness on consumer responses to target products is driven by a differential level of satiation – high <b>representative</b> <b>samples</b> lead to a higher level of satiation. Moreover, I find that the effect of sample representativeness on consumer responses to target products is strengthened when need for cognition is low...|$|R

As of June 2012, in the United States, about 1200 index ETFs exist, with about 50 actively managed ETFs. Index ETF assets are about $1.2 trillion, compared with about $7 billion for actively managed ETFs.
