5000|$|However, Taylor {{realized}} that in practice, {{there is much}} heterogeneity in the length of wage contract across the economy. [...] "There {{is a great deal}} of heterogeneity in wage and price setting. In fact, the data suggest that there is as much a difference between the average lengths of different types of price setting arrangements, or between the average lengths of different types of wage setting arrangements, as there is between wage setting and price setting. Grocery prices change much more frequently than magazine prices - frozen orange juice prices change every two weeks, while magazine prices change every three years! Wages in some industries change once per year on average, while others change per quarter and others once every two years. One might hope that a model with homogenous <b>representative</b> <b>price</b> or wage setting would be a good approximation to this more complex world, but most likely some degree of heterogeneity will be required to describe reality accurately." ...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{mortgage}} prepayment and valuation models {{assume that}} two mortgage pools {{with the same}} observable characteristics should behave indistinguishably. However, even pools with apparently identical characteristics often exhibit markedly different prepayment behavior. The sources of this heterogeneity may be unobservable, but we can infer information about a pool from its prepayment behavior over time. This paper develops a methodology for using this information to calculate pool-specific mortgage-backed security prices. Knowledge of these prices is important both for portfolio valuation and for determining the cheapest pool to deliver when selling mortgage-backed securities. We find that unobservable heterogeneity between mortgage pools is statistically significant, and that pool-specific prices, calculated for a sample of outwardly identical mortgage pools between 1983 and 1989, may di#er greatly from any single <b>representative</b> <b>price...</b>|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} {{that there is no}} {{analytical}} formula for pricing arithmetic average Asian options. Hull and White (1993) proposed feasible tree-based algorithm to solve this problem, in which each node keeps an identical number of <b>representative</b> average <b>prices</b> calculated via equally-spaced placement between the range of the corresponding maximum and minimum arithmetic average prices, and the piece-wise linear interpolation method is applied to derive the corresponding continuation value of each <b>representative</b> average <b>price</b> in the backward induction phase. In this paper, the above classic algorithm is modified to minimize the interpolation error. First, the <b>representative</b> average <b>price</b> are determined by the zeros of Chebyshev polynomial to minimize the Lagrange interpolation error for each node. Second, the optimal allocation of the number of <b>representative</b> average <b>prices</b> is derived to further minimize the accumulated interpolation error for European arithmetic average options. Numerical results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed model.

The cost of a staples basket {{is used as a}} price <b>representative.</b> <b>Price</b> dispersion measured as the standard deviation of prices is found to be diminishing since about 1994; and the shape of the cross-region distribution of prices tends to be more regular over time. To characterize intra-distribution mobility, a transition probability function (stochastic kernel) is estimated. It is also used to derive a long-run limit of the price distribution. Overall, the results suggest that, excluding a few years following the price liberalization, price convergence has been happening among Russian regions. price convergence, price dispersion, distribution dynamics, market integration, Russia...|$|E
40|$|International trade models often {{postulate}} {{the existence}} of a <b>representative</b> <b>price,</b> i. e., the price which prevails at all markets. This is known as the "Law of One Price. " In this paper, the law of one price is tested for seven commodities among four countries by explicitly considering transaction costs. The empirical evidence suggests that, in most cases, the law of one price cannot be rejected asa maintained hypothesis. Furthermore, for the remaining cases transaction costs seem to cause the failure. Key words: cointegration, "Law of One Price, " stationarity, transaction costs. International trade models of agricultural com-modities often postulate {{the existence of}} a rep-resentative price, i. e., a price which prevails at all markets. This known as the "Law of One Pfice " (LOP). The LOP assumption is crucial, especially in empirical studies, because its vi-olation may invalidate the studies ' conclusions. For example, a model of optimal intervention i a specific commodity market, domestic or in-ternational, requires a <b>representative</b> <b>price.</b> If an inappropriate price is dations based on such expected effects.

However, such pro-cedures have not yielded favorable results re-garding the LOP (e. g., Isard and Richardson among others). Those tests have been criticized on several grounds.

40|$|In {{this article}} we present both a {{theoretical}} framework and a solved example for pricing an European gas storage facility and computing the optimal strategy for its operation. As a <b>representative</b> <b>price</b> index we choose the Dutch TTF day-ahead gas price. We present statistical evidence that the volatility of this index is time-varying, so we introduce a new continuous-time model by incorporating GARCH diffusion into an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Based on this price process we use dynamic programming methods to derive partial differential equations for pricing a storage facility. As an example we apply our methodology to a storage site located in Epe at the German-Dutch border. In this context we investigate the effects of multiple contract types, and perform a sensitivity analysis for all model parameters. We obtain a value surface displaying the properties of a financial straddle. Both volatility and mean reversion influenc...|$|E

40|$|According to {{economic}} theory, {{a competitive market}} leads to the most efficient allocation of resources amongst producers, and {{for goods and services}} among consumers. In this dissertation, various aspects of the first-hand market for cod is investigated. Through the study of the price determination processes, both geographically and in product space, {{we have been able to}} reveal that this market functions well. The first paper investigates the level of market integration between different regions that include the two biggest sales organizations in Norway, and between fresh and frozen cod. The results indicate that the market for exvessel cod in Norway is integrated. There is evidence that the price determination in the area of the largest sales organization is leading the smallest. Fresh and frozen cod also belongs to the same market, and the frozen cod market is leading the fresh market, ensuring that the Norwegian market for fresh cod is also a part of a global market. The second paper estimates the value of the different attributes of cod across different regions, such as the processing form, the quality, size and gear-type. There are significant differences in the valuation of different attributes and the results shows heterogeneity in the pricing of the attributes between regions. This implies that even though there is basically one <b>representative</b> <b>price</b> for cod that is valid for all regions, there are still regional price variations. The third paper finds that the seven major product forms of cod at the export level can be aggregated into one representative index, hence, cod is a commodity. In addition, there is a long-run relationship between the firsthand price of cod and the cod price index. This shows that there is one <b>representative</b> <b>price</b> for cod at the export level which follows the same price pattern over time as the first-hand price of cod. The fourth paper finds a link between the legally mandated minimum price of cod and several of the exported cod products, so indicating that the minimum price is market-based. Furthermore, we estimated the effect of the cod price index from paper 3, and other variables, on the margin between the minimum price and the first-hand price. The aggregate price transmission effect is less than or equal to one, implying that the price signals from the market is transmitted to the first-hand market in a 1 : 1 relationship...|$|E
