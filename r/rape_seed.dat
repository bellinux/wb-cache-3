25|$|Crops grown include {{traditional}} {{arable crops}} seen {{elsewhere in the}} country but also include <b>rape</b> <b>seed,</b> turf and sugar beet. The last was a familiar sight being hauled by tractor in large open-top trailers to York, where it was used by firms such as Nestlé and, until its closure in 2007, British Sugar. Job cuts have reduced the acreage of this crop, although feasibility studies have shown that sugar beet could be used commercially to produce cleaner car fuel. Pocklington is bisected by the largely culverted Pocklington Beck, a small brook that feeds into the Pocklington Canal. The beck and canal are usually good fishing grounds but a sewerage overflow in 2003 killed thousands of fish and severely damaged the ecosystem, from which it is now recovered.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of different levels of rape „ 00 ” seeds in the diet on the performance, blood and bone parameters of broilers. A total of 180 1 -day-old male Ross 308 chicks were divided into four groups. Group I (the control) was fed on a maize, wheat and soybean diet. Different levels of <b>rape</b> <b>seeds</b> were used in the experimental diets (low, medium and high level in II, III and IV groups, respectively) instead of a soybean meal. The amount of MJ AMEN from <b>rape</b> <b>seeds</b> in total AMEN was as follows: 0. 19 - 1. 51 group II, 0. 28 - 2. 26 group III and 0. 38 - 3. 01 group IV. The highest level of <b>rape</b> <b>seeds</b> resulted in a lower (P< 0. 05) body weight gain. The birds from group IV had the lowest feed intake and the poorest (P< 0. 05) value of FCR at 21 d. The highest level of <b>rape</b> <b>seeds</b> positively influenced (P< 0. 05) the content of HDL. There were no differences in protein metabolism indices, VLDL, Ca, Pi, bone resistance parameters among dietary treatments at 37 day of age.

40|$|Due to {{the high}} {{nitrogen}} requirements, oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> should be cultivated after rye-grass-clover mixtures (Böhm 2007). But in this case oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> is in competition with wheat, because wheat has a high N-requirement as well. So, the crop rotation must be organized in another way, {{so that there is}} no competition between oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> and wheat. In two-year field trials at the experimental farm of the Institute of Organic Farming (FAL) in Trenthorst the hypothesis was tested, whether oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> with an undersown white clover is a better preceding crop to wheat compared to oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> without underseed. Additionally, the yield was compared to “wheat after ryegrass-clover mixture”. The results showed a higher yield of wheat after oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> with undersown white clover compared to the wheat after oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> without underseed. Only in one year was the yield of wheat after ryegrass-clover mixture about 0. 45 t ha- 1 higher than the yield of wheat after oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> with undersown white clover. Under the given conditions of location, the yield of wheat after “oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> with an undersown white clover” is similar to that after ryegrass-clover mixture. So, an integration of oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> in the crop rotation seems possible without a lower yield of wheat...|$|R
40|$|In Switzerland, the {{cultivation}} of genetically modified (GM) oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) {{and the use of}} its seeds for food and feed are not permitted. Nevertheless, the GM oilseed rape events GT 73, MS 8 ×RF 3, MS 8 and RF 3 have recently been found in the Rhine port of Basel, Switzerland. The sources of GM oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>seeds</b> have been unknown. The main agricultural good being imported at the Rhine port of Basel is wheat and from 2010 to 2013, 19 % of all Swiss wheat imports originated from Canada. As over 90 % of all oilseed rape grown in Canada is GM, we hypothesised that imports of Canadian wheat may contain low level impurities of GM oilseed rape. Therefore, waste fraction samples gathered during the mechanical cleaning of Canadian wheat from two Swiss grain mills were analysed by separating oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>seeds</b> from waste fraction samples and testing DNA of pooled seeds for the presence of transgenes by real-time PCR. Furthermore, oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>seeds</b> from each grain mill were sown in a germination experiment, and seedling DNA was tested for the presence of transgenes by real-time PCR. GT 73, MS 8 ×RF 3, MS 8 and RF 3 oilseed rape was detected among seed samples and seedlings of both grain mills. Based on this data, we projected a mean proportion of 0. 005 % of oilseed rape in wheat imported from Canada. Besides Canadian wheat, the Rhine port of Basel does not import any other significant amounts of agricultural products from GM oilseed rape producing countries. We therefore conclude that Canadian wheat is the major source of unintended introduction of GM oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>seeds</b> into Switzerland...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a 3 -year field experiment conducted on soil with moderate levels of boron (B) in north-eastern Poland to determine the influence of foliar application of B (0, 150 and 300 g ha- 1) on the yield components, yield, mineral composition, nutritional value and feed value of winter oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>seeds.</b> Foliar application of B at the beginning of bud formation in winter oilseed <b>rape</b> increased <b>seed</b> yield by 0. 19 (3 %) at the lower B fertilization level to 0. 26 Mg ha- 1 (4 %) at the higher B fertilization level. The observed increase in the yield of winter oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>seeds</b> in response to foliar application of B can be attributed to this micronutrient’s positive influence on seed production in siliques. Foliar fertilization with B increased B content and decreased Zn and Fe levels in the seeds of winter oilseed rape. When B fertilizer was applied at the rate of 150 – 300 g ha- 1, the N and Ca content of the evaluated seeds increased. The fertilizer improved the nutritional value (crude fat content, fatty acid concentrations) of seeds, but deteriorated their feed value (total protein content, acid detergent fiber concentrations, neutral detergent fiber concentrations, quantitative and qualitative composition of glucosinolates) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} organic oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> is very high. The reason is, rape oil plays an {{important}} role in human nutrition and rape cake in animal nutrition. The range of varia-tion in the quality of oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> required a fast and easy analytical method for the determination of the main ingredients. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is known for its rapidity and accuracy and may become a useful tool in predicting the quality of organic growing oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape.</b> The aim of the investigations was to evaluate the ability of NIRS to predict the content of oil and fatty acids in full fat oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> without any preparation. Spectra from 125 rape samples were scanned in the spectral range from 1000 to 2500 nm and used to develop NIRS equations. Two-third of the samples were used in the calibration set and the remaining samples in the validation set. NIRS equations were calculated by partial least square regression and different pretreat-ments of spectra. Prediction was successful for oil content (r= 0. 97) with an standard error of prediction of 0. 42. The fatty acids were also successfully predicted with re-gression coefficients from 0. 86 to 0. 97 with exception of the erucic acid. But the con-tent of erucic acid is quite low, the prediction of the content was not satisfying. The obtained results indicated that the NIRS could be successful used in the predic-tion of ingredients in oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape</b> without sample preparation and therefore for the fast assessment of product quality in oil <b>seed</b> <b>rape.</b> ...|$|R

30|$|The {{choice of}} oilseed rape - besides maize - as a {{candidate}} for BINATS was requested by the two commissioning Austrian Ministries. Actually, GM oilseed rape is permitted in the EU only for placing on the market for import (viable GMO). A notification for the cultivation of GM oilseed rape in the European Union has been rejected within the EU in 2005. This has been a case-by-case decision, and {{there is no guarantee that}} in the future notifications seeking for approval of cultivation will not be applied. Nevertheless, a basic consensus but no 'official agreement' within the Member States exists that cultivation of oilseed rape should be avoided due to unpredictable environmental risks. Hence, data about the occurrence and frequency of potential hybridisation partners of oilseed rape were collected within BINATS to allow for a coarse regional assessment of the risks involved in releasing a GM crop with that high potential for hybridisation and long viability of seeds. These data could also serve at least as background information in connection with an eventual import of GM oilseed <b>rape</b> <b>seeds.</b> Seed lots during transport activities may result in persisting feral oilseed rape populations e.g. [20 – 27], which are also able to exchange transgenes with wild species sexually compatible with them.|$|R
