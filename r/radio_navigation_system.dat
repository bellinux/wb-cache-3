5|$|Loomis and DuBridge {{recruited}} physicists {{for the new}} {{laboratory at}} an Applied Nuclear Physics conference at MIT in October 1940. Among those who volunteered was Rabi. His assignment was to study the magnetron, which was so secret {{that it had to}} be kept in a safe. The Radiation Laboratory scientists set their sights on producing a microwave radar set by 6 January 1941, and having a prototype installed in a Douglas A-20 Havoc by March. This was done; the technological obstacles were gradually overcome, and a working US microwave radar set was produced. The magnetron was further developed on both sides of the Atlantic to permit a reduction in wavelength from 150cm to 10cm, and then to 3cm. The laboratory went on to develop air-to-surface radar to detect submarines, the SCR-584 radar for fire control, and LORAN, a long-range <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system.</b> At Rabi's instigation, a branch of the Radiation Laboratory was located at Columbia, with Rabi in charge.|$|E
5|$|The SPARS were {{assigned}} to every USCG district except Puerto Rico, and served in Hawaii and Alaska as well. Most officers held general duty billets, which included administrative and supervisory assignments. Other officers served as communication officers, supply officers, barracks, and recruiting officers. The bulk of the enlisted women performed clerical and stenographic duties. In smaller numbers, the enlisted personnel were found in practically every other billet, from baking pies to rigging parachutes and driving jeeps. A select group of SPAR officers and enlisted personnel were also assigned {{to work with the}} Long Range Aid to Navigation at monitoring stations in the Continental United States. Better known under the acronym LORAN, it was a top-secret <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> developed for ships at sea and long-range aircraft. The first monitoring station staffed by SPARS was at Chatham, Massachusetts. Chatham {{is believed to have been}} (at the time) the only all female-staffed station of its kind in the world. The SPARS peak strength was approximately 11,000 officers and enlisted personnel. Commodore J. A. Hirschfield, USCG, said the SPARS volunteered for duty when their country needed them, and they did their jobs with enthusiasm, efficiency, and with a minimum of fanfare. To honor the SPARS, two USCG cutters were given their name.|$|E

The main problem with the system was that, although highly accurate for stationary or slow-moving ships, it required several hours of observation by the receiving station to fix a position, making it unusable for many navigation purposes and for {{the guidance of the}} new generation of ballistic missiles.|$|E
25|$|The Orfordness Rotating Wireless Beacon, known {{simply as}} the Orfordness Beacon or {{sometimes}} the Black Beacon, was an early <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> introduced by the United Kingdom in July 1929.

The system was similar to the earlier German Telefunken Kompass Sender and the later Sonne system.|$|E
500|$|Initially, SPARS were {{prohibited}} from serving in USCG districts outside the country. But in late 1944, Congress amended the law allowing SPARS to serve overseas. For the SPARS, this meant Hawaii and Alaska. However, only those with good records, good physical health, a year's service, and {{training and experience}} {{in the types of}} duty requested were selected. About 200 women served in Hawaii, doing roughly the same kind of work, and holding the same ratings, that they would have held in the United States. About an equal number of women served in Alaska as well. A select group of SPAR officers and enlisted personnel were assigned to work with the Long Range Aid to Navigation at monitoring stations in the Continental United States. Better known under the acronym LORAN, it was a top-secret <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> developed for ships at sea, and long-range aircraft. The first monitoring station staffed by SPARS was at Chatham, Massachusetts, after they had received two months of instructions at M.I.T. on the operation and maintenance of LORAN.

500|$|Following the {{analysis}} of the Butt Report, the British High Command made a number of decisions in February 1942 that changed the nature of the bomber war against Germany. On 14 February, Air Chief Marshal Norman Bottomley issued the [...] "Area Bombing Directive", which lifted the restrictions placed on the bombers in 1941. Air Chief Marshal Arthur Harris, commonly known as [...] "Bomber" [...] Harris, was appointed Commander-in-Chief of Bomber Command. These decisions, coupled with the introduction of Gee, a <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> which enabled better target-finding and bombing accuracy, led to the first Allied 1,000 bomber raid. In Operation Millennium, the RAF targeted and bombed Cologne on the night of 30/31 May 1942. Schnaufer did not participate in the missions in defence of Cologne. The Himmelbett procedure had limitations in the number of aircraft which can be controlled. Therefore, only the most experienced crews were deployed, and Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer, who had yet to achieve their first aerial victory, were left out. Prior to Operation Millennium, Schnaufer had been appointed Technischer Offizier (TO—Technical Officer) on 10 April 1942 and was located at Sint-Truiden again. As a Technical Officer, Schnaufer was responsible for the supervision of all technical aspects such as routine maintenance, servicing and modifications of the Gruppe. In this role he was no longer a member of the 5. Staffel but was then a member of the Stab (staff) of II./NJG1.|$|E

40|$|GNSS, or more {{precisely}} GNSS- 2, is an abbreviation for Glob al <b>Navigation</b> Satellite <b>Systems</b> – Second generation, {{and serves as a}} generic name for the class of modern global sa tellite based <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems.</b> GNSS- 2 consists mainly of the four major Global <b>Navigation</b> Satellite <b>Systems</b> known as: GPS (U. S.), GLONASS (Russia), Galileo (EU) and Bei-Dou- 2 (China). All these global <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> are based on the same navigation principle, i. e. utilizing ultra- stable clocks in satellites to determine the user position by independent measurements of the transit time of electromagnetic signals transmitted from satellites in orbit, so-called <b>Radio</b> <b>Navigation</b> Satellite Services (RNSS). The typical performance of these global <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> is to provide absolute positioning to an observer {{on the surface of the}} Earth within the precision of 5 - 10 meter. However, this precision can be improved utilizing state of the art processing techniques such as Precise Point Positioning (PPP), currently demonstrating absolute positioning of 5 - 10 centimeters utilizing only one receiver. To achieve this astonishing precision in terms of absolute position, the rate of time as measured on the clock in the satellite must be known to better than a few nanoseconds. Since the satellites are constantly moving with respect to the observer and are also located at highly different gravitational potentials, effects predicted by both the Special- and General theories of Relativity must be considered in order to achieve the desired accuracy in the observed transit times. These systems are in fact one of the very few man made systems, outside of particle accelerators, that experience significant relativistic effects...|$|R
