40|$|Hosts {{connected}} to the Internet continue to suffer attacks with high frequency. The use of an intrusion detector allows potential threats to be flagged. When an alarm is raised, preventive action can be taken. A primary goal of such action is to assure {{the security of the}} data stored in the system. If this operation is effected manually, the delay between the alarm and the response may be enough for an intruder to cause significant damage. The alternative proposed in this paper is to provide a <b>response</b> <b>primitive</b> for intrusion detectors to utilize in automating the response. We describe RICE, a modification to the Java file subsystem that provides such functionality for data that is deemed to be threatened by an attack. If it is activated when an intrusion appears likely to succeed, it guarantees the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the protected data even after a system is compromised. In particular, RICE allows cryptographic encapsulation of data to be reduced to simple key deletion {{so that it can be}} effected rapidly. Further, it uses digitally signed hashes of file deltas to allow untainted data to be distinguished from the rest. Finally, file deltas are replicated at a remote node to ensure that changes made by an attacker can be undone using the remote replicas. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{generation}} of sequential responses {{is a fundamental}} aspect of cognitive function, encompassing processes such as motor control, linguistic expression, memory recall and thought itself. There is considerable evidence that complex cognitive responses (such as voluntary actions) are constructed as chunked sequences of more elementary <b>response</b> <b>primitives</b> or synergies, which can themselves be seen often as sequences of simpler primitives. Almost all neural models of sequence representation {{are based on the}} principle of recurrence, where each successive item is generated by preceding items. However, it is also interesting to consider the possibility of purely spatial neural representations that result in sequential readout of preexisting response elements. Such representations offer several potential benefits, including parsimony, efficiency, flexibility and generalization. In particular, they can allow response sequences to be stored in memory as chunks encoded by fixed point attractors. In this paper, we present a simple spiking neuron model for the flexible encoding and replay of response sequences through the impulsive triggering of coding patterns represented as fixed point attractors. While not intended as a detailed description of a specific brain region, the model seeks to capture fundamental control mechanisms that may apply {{in many parts of the}} nervous system.

40|$|Haematopoiesis is {{the complex}} {{developmental}} process that maintains the turnover of all blood cell lineages. It critically {{depends on the}} correct functioning of rare, quiescent haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and more numerous, HSC-derived, highly proliferative and differentiating haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Infection is known to affect HSCs, with severe and chronic inflammatory stimuli leading to stem cell pool depletion, while acute, non-lethal infections exert transient and even potentiating effects. Both whether this paradigm applies to all infections and whether the HSC response is the dominant driver of the changes observed during stressed haematopoiesis remain open questions. We use a mouse model of malaria, based on natural, sporozoite-driven Plasmodium berghei infection, as an experimental platform to gain a global view of haematopoietic perturbations during infection progression. We observe coordinated responses by the most primitive HSCs and multiple HPCs, some starting before blood parasitaemia is detected. We show that, despite highly variable inter-host <b>responses,</b> <b>primitive</b> HSCs become highly proliferative, but mathematical modelling suggests that this alone {{is not sufficient to}} significantly impact the whole haematopoietic cascade. We observe that the dramatic expansion of Sca- 1 (+) progenitors results from combined proliferation of direct HSC progeny and phenotypic changes in downstream populations. We observe that the simultaneous perturbation of HSC/HPC population dynamics is coupled with early signs of anaemia onset.

In the myelomonocytic leukaemia cell lines WEHI 3 B-D+ and M 1, ectopic expression of the wild-type c-Mpl receptor induced TPO-dependent cellular differentiation characterized by increased cell migration through agar and acquisition of the morphology and molecular markers of macrophages.

This paper summarizes preliminary studies in which formal probabilistic descriptions of the material-behavior- and fabrication-related parameters were incorporated into micromechanics and macromechanics for CMC'S. In this process two existing methodologies, namely CMC micromechanics and macromechanics analysis and a fast probability integration (FPI) technique are synergistically coupled to obtain the probabilistic composite behavior or response.
