On the basis of 120 phytosociological records, taken in 1977, 6 associations were distinguished (Tables 1 - 8) : Digitarietum ischaemi, Bilderdykio-Lamietum amplexicaule, Galinsogo-Setarietum, Echino-chloo-Setarietum, Veronico-Setarietum pumilae, Lamio-Veronicetum politae.

40|$|This paper reports new {{stands of}} subatlantic Spergulo-Chrysanthemetium segeti associalion, {{found on the}} Olsztyn Lake District area. This {{association}} is very seldom described from Poland. It occurs in spring <b>crops</b> and <b>root</b> <b>crops</b> <b>cultivations.</b> The most important attributes of this association are: a mass occurrence of Chrysanthemum segetum, a numerous occurrence of Spergula arvensis, a big contribution of Centauretalia cyani species and habitat's humidity, indicated {{in the presence of}} numerous hygrophytes. Communities of this assciation found on Olsztyn Lake District are similaI to the other Spergulo-Chrysanthemetum segeti phytocoenoses, described from the other regions of Poland. However, they show a little differences too. The most important of them are: very small paIticipation of Eu-Polygono- Chenopodion species and the absence of Panico-Semrion species, general floristic scantiness and small participation of Chrysanthemum segetum and Spergula arvensis in the most of records. Spergulo-Chrysanthemetum segeti communities occur very seldom in {{the central part of the}} Olsztyn Lake District and they are probably the farthest advanced to the east, known stands of this association in Poland...|$|R
40|$|Islands {{have often}} been cited as models of human impact upon the environment. With high rates of {{endemism}} and other unique characteristics, island ecosystems are subject to dramatic perturbation. The arrival of humans in Near Oceania during the Pleistocene led swiftly {{to a series of}} fauna extinctions. In the New Guinea Highlands clearing and tending of wild plants gave rise to tree and <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> agriculture, intensive <b>cultivation</b> technology, and anthropogenic grasslands. By 3600 BP (Before Present), Lapita settlers had reached Remote Oceania, leading to deforestation and declines in birds and other species. European contact introduced new biota and new technology, with significant consequences for island environments and societies. Questions have been raised concerning the impact of climate change on island ecosystems. Population growth plays a significant role in environmental degradation, though not necessarily as a proximate cause. The Tikopian arboriculture system provides one of several Oceanic models of sustainability...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed at}} {{the examination of the}} contemporary diversity and changes in <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> <b>cultivation</b> in Ojców National Park and its protection zone. The communities of Lamio-Veronicetum politae scleranthetosum, Lamio-Veronicetum fumarietosum and Echinochloo-Setarietum pumilae were distinguished in the area. The distribution of communities and their species diversity depend on the soil type. The present study discusses the changes that occurred in the studied communities during the years 1963 – 2006. The main differences that appeared in the course of that period concern the impoverishment of the weed flora and homogenization of the species composition. A large group of weeds, mainly archaeophytes, became rare and some of them were not found in the area. A few species of kenophytes, e. g. Galinsoga ciliata and Alopecurus myosuroides, have a tendency to expand. The observed phenomena can be connected with the technological progress and socio-economical transformation...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} {{a review of}} the currently available archaeological evidence relating to the transition to food production in eastern Africa, and some of the supporting linguistic and genetic evidence. In broad terms, livestock herding preceded <b>crop</b> <b>cultivation</b> in the region, with an initial emphasis on sheep and goats, commencing around 4500 to 5000 years ago. By around 3000 years ago, full-blown pastoralist societies with an emphasis on cattle herding occupied much of the savannah areas. From ca. 2500 year ago, metal using farming communities, practicing hoe <b>cultivation</b> of <b>roots</b> <b>crops</b> and cereals were also present, interacting with both pastoralist and autochthonous hunting-gathering-fishing communities. These interactions gave rise to diverse ethnic mosaic, alongside extensive genetic and linguistic exchanges...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new perspective}} for the temporal variation of <b>crop</b> <b>cultivation</b> adoption during the period 6000 - 5400 BP in Flevoland (central Netherlands) based on the spatial evolution of soils and hydrology. To determine the role of soil properties and groundwater level rise in the adoption of <b>crop</b> <b>cultivation</b> in wetlands, mapping of the mid-Holocene palaeotopography, palaeohydrology, soil conditions and distribution of Swifterbant archaeological remains was combined with grain size analyses of cored sediments in two selected study areas. Results show that the low natural fertility and water holding capacity of the sandy soils on the Pleistocene surface in southern Flevoland compared to the loamy soils {{in the northern part}} of Flevoland, can explain the lack of <b>crop</b> <b>cultivation</b> in the south.

40|$|Alternative {{development}} is {{closely associated with}} reductions in drug <b>crop</b> <b>cultivation</b> at the local level. However, currently these local successes cannot be directly attributed to alternative development interventions because the motivations and circumstances that determine household drug <b>crop</b> <b>cultivation</b> remain largely unexplored. Research has {{tended to focus on}} aggregate trends in drug <b>crop</b> <b>cultivation</b> at the national, regional and village level. The specific socio-economic, cultural and environmental circumstances that influence household production are consequently overlooked in project design. Rather, alternative development initiatives have adopted a uniform approach where emphasis is placed on the high economic returns that opium and coca are reported to accrue per unit of land. This paper rejects this uni-causal explanation of drug <b>crop</b> <b>cultivation</b> that finds its basis in the assumption that drug crop producers are a homogenous group. It offers an insight into the diversity of factors that influence household drug <b>crop</b> <b>cultivation</b> that are currently neglected, including returns on labour, access to credit and land, and the effect of law enforcement and conditionality. It indicates that the failure to recognise the dynamics of household decision making has implications for the cost effectiveness of the current strategy and raises questions as to the unintended consequences of alternative development, particularly with regard to its impact on the poor and the process of relocation. It also illustrates that greater attention needs to be given to the timing and interface between law enforcement initiatives and alternative development interventions. The paper concludes that a greater understanding of the multi-functional role that drug crops play in the socio-economy of the household would assist in determining more effective and sustainable initiatives aimed at reducing both existing, and potential drug <b>crop</b> <b>cultivation.</b> It also suggests that the overall success of supply side interventions will be contingent on reductions in demand both internationally and increasingly in source countries...|$|R

We present an overview of existing research data and conclusions, describing the impact of <b>crop</b> <b>cultivation</b> on biodiversity on Irish arable farms. An extensive literature review clearly indicates that peer-reviewed publications on research conducted in Ireland on this topic are quite scarce: just 21 papers investigating the effect of conventional <b>crop</b> <b>cultivation</b> on Irish biodiversity have been published within the past 30 years. Principally, these studies have concluded that conventional <b>crop</b> <b>cultivation</b> has had an adverse impact on biodiversity on Irish farms, with 15 of the 21 studies demonstrating negative trends for the taxa investigated. Compared to other EU states, the relative dearth of baseline data and absence of monitoring programmes designed to assess the specific impacts of <b>crop</b> <b>cultivation</b> on Irish biodiversity highlight the need to develop long-term research studies. With many new challenges facing Irish agriculture, a research programme must be initiated to measure current levels of biodiversity on arable land and to assess the main farming ‘pressures’ causing significant biodiversity loss or gains in these systems...|$|R
