40|$|The {{information}} of the source-sink dynamics of carbohydrates during early growth can indicate when perennial weeds {{are most vulnerable}} to mechanical control. In this study, carbohydrate contents in the <b>roots</b> <b>or</b> <b>rhizomes</b> of two noxious perennial weeds, Cirsium arvense and Tussilago farfara, and basipetal translocation of photo-assimilates were measured. We used HPLC for carbohydrate measurements and 14 C labelling to follow the translocation of photo-assimilates during the early growth. These measurements were related to leaf number and leaf area. Fructan and fructose changed significantly over the experimental periods. Fructan for both species was greatest within two weeks after planting 5 -cm long root/rhizome fragments and declined thereafter. After two weeks, fructose concentrations, which were at their minimum level at planting time, rose sharply due to fructan depolymerisation. The radioactive carbon applied to the aerial parts translocated rapidly to <b>root</b> <b>or</b> <b>rhizome</b> systems around 500 to 600 d° C after emergence. We concluded that while the fructan was continuously depleted in the <b>roots</b> <b>or</b> <b>rhizomes</b> and reached their minimum levels 33 days after emergence, the basipetal translocation of photo-assimilates started earlier (21 - 23 days after emergence). The carbon compensation point occurred at eight or six leaves for Cirsium arvense and Tussilago farfara, with a total leaf area of 200 cm 2 for both species. ...|$|R

40|$|Multi-origin Chinese herbal medicines, {{with herbs}} {{originating}} {{from more than}} one species of plants, is a common phenomenon but an important issue in Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs). In the present study, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) —based fatty acid profiling approach to rapidly discriminate multi-origin Chinese medicines in terms of species and medicinal parts was proposed and validated using tuberous roots (Curcumae Radix) and rhizomes (Curcumae Rhizoma and Curcumae Longae Rhizoma) derived from four Curcuma species (e. g., C. wenyujin, C. kwangsiensis, C. phaeocaulis and C. longa) as models. Both type and content of fatty acids varied among different species of either tuberous <b>roots</b> <b>or</b> <b>rhizomes,</b> indicating each species has its own fatty acid pattern. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) based on dataset of global fatty acid profiling showed that either tuberous <b>roots</b> <b>or</b> <b>rhizomes</b> samples could be clearly classified into four clusters according to their species. Furthermore, those tested samples could also be discriminated in terms of their medicinal parts (e. g., tuberous root and rhizome). Our findings suggest that the proposed GC-MS-based fatty acid profiling followed by multivariate statistical analysis provides a reliable platform to discriminate multi-origin Chinese herbal medicines according to species and medicinal parts, which will be helpful for ensuring their quality, safety and efficacy...|$|R

Its dried <b>root</b> <b>or</b> <b>rhizome,</b> commonly called ‘red sage’, has been used for centuries in the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (Zhou et al. 2005). S. miltiorrhiza contains two major groups of active compounds: the lipophilic diterpenoids and hydrophilic phenolic acids (Li et al. 2009). Modern pharmacological studies have demonstrated that these compounds are responsible for many therapeutic actions, such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anti-carcinogenic, and antioxidant activities (Zhou et al. 2005; Hung et al. 2010; Wang 2010). Besides, S. miltiorrhiza has also become widely accepted as functional food due to its significant antioxidant capacity.|$|R

This fact accords with the principle that the valuable and selected parts of all cultivated productions present {{the greatest amount of}} modification. They differ much in size and shape, being globular, oval, flattened, kidney-like, or cylindrical. One variety from Peru is described (9/99. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1862 page 1052.) as being quite straight, and at least six inches in length, though no thicker than a man's finger. The eyes or buds differ in form, position, and colour.

30|$|There are {{relatively}} few {{data on the}} vertical distribution of below ground organs in soil. For understory species in eastern Canadian boreal forest, Flinn and Wein (1977) found the depths of underground reproductive structures (<b>root</b> <b>or</b> <b>rhizome)</b> to be species-specific. Of 23 herb and shrub species, structures of six species were predominantly located in the top few centimeters of the litter layer, structures of five species were found within the F and H layer, and structures of 12 species were found from 3 cm to 15 cm depth in mineral soil (Flinn and Wein 1977). In Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) forests of southern interior British Columbia, Canada, McLean (1969) assessed depth of regenerative tissue and whether it was located within duff layers or mineral soil for 26 species. Based on depth and location, he classified species {{in terms of their}} relative fire resistance. Choczynska and Johnson (2009) found that most buds of three rhizomatous grasses occurred within a few centimeters of the soil surface, though the distribution had a long tail, with many buds occurring more deeply within the soil. Given that data on type and depths of reproductive structures are known, duff consumption and soil heating models are pivotal in predicting their mortality (e.g., Choczynska and Johnson 2009).|$|R

We analyzed different environmental compartments {{and the highest}} concentrations of Pb and Zn {{were found in the}} interstitial and seawater. The concentrations of Cd and Zn were significantly higher in blades compared with <b>roots</b> <b>or</b> <b>rhizomes</b> in T. hemprichii and E. acoroides, respectively. A metal pollution index (MPI) demonstrated that sediment, interstitial water, and seagrasses in the sites located nearest anthropogenic sources of pollution had the most abundant metal concentrations. There was obvious seasonal variation of these metals in the three seagrasses with higher concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn in January and Cd in July. Furthermore, the relationships between metal concentrations in seagrasses and environmental compartments were positively correlated significantly. The bioconcentration factors (BCF) demonstrated that Cd from the tissues of the three seagrasses might be absorbed from the sediment by the roots. However, for C. rotundata, Zn is likely to be derived from the seawater through its blades. Therefore, the blades of T. hemprichii, E. acoroides and C. rotundata are potential bio-indicators to Cd content in sediment, and additionally Zn content (C. rotundata only) in seawater...|$|R
40|$|Background: Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) {{injury is}} {{associated}} with systemic inflammatory response.

Recent studies have demonstrated that TSA has protective effects against focal cerebral I/R injury. However, {{little is known about the}} underlying mechanisms. Here we put forward the hypothesis that TSA acts through inhibition of MIF expression during focal cerebral I/ R injury in rats. Methodology/Principal Findings: Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 hours. This was followed by reperfusion. We measured neurological deficits, brain water content, and infarct volume, and found that neurological dysfunction, brain edema, and brain infarction were significantly attenuated by TSA 6 hours after reperfusion. We also measured myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity at 6 and 24 hours, and found that neutrophil infiltration was significantly higher in the vehicle+I/R group than in the TSA+I/R group. ELISA demonstrated that TSA could inhibit MIF expression and the release of TNF-a and IL- 6 induced by I/R injury. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining showed that MIF expression was significantly lower in the TSA+I/R group than in the vehicle+I/R group.

5000|$|Some knotweeds grow {{extremely}} quickly {{during the}} spring; giant knotweed can reach 4.5 m by summer, Japanese knotweed 3 m, and [...] "dwarf" [...] Himalayan knotweed 1.5-2 m. In Japan, Japanese knotweed {{is known as}} itadori, or [...] "strong plant". Some species can spread rapidly from an extensive network of rhizomes (roots that can sprout) spreading from 7-20 m from the parent plant and at least 2 m deep. Root and stem fragments as small as 1 cm can form new plant colonies. Floods and high water events wash whole or partial plants into rivers and creeks, dispersing pieces of knotweed throughout the flooded area and banks, which give rise to new plants. As with other invasive species of plants, freshly disturbed soil allows the rapidly growing young knotweed plants to outgrow other plants and take over the area, suppressing other species. Cutting, mowing, digging and some herbicide treatments, especially in early to mid growing season, fail to curb knotweed growth and in fact often stimulate the production of shoots from latent buds dispersed on the <b>root</b> crown <b>or</b> <b>rhizomes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Dormancy, {{which is}} the {{inability}} to initiate normal growth under otherwise favourable conditions, is an adaptation to escape sprouting prior to seasonal cold temperatures and/or drought in areas where winters are harsh or summers dry. Dormancy in woody perennials of northern temperate areas is, in general, induced by photoperiodic and/or temperature changes, and released after prolonged exposure to chilling. Besides being species specific, northern ecotypes are usually more sensitive to inductive signals than are southern ecotypes (in cold temperate areas). Dormancy in perennial weeds has been little studied, but might influence the effect of weed control measures. These often involve repeated fragmentation of the <b>roots</b> <b>or</b> <b>rhizomes</b> to stimulate re-sprouting, thus reducing the storage of nutrient reserves. Such measures {{would be a waste}} of energy and time if conducted during a period of dormancy. Furthermore, herbicide applications might be less efficient, since there is no or little transport to reproductive organs. In this thesis, the autumnal growth pattern of five perennial weeds, which all propagate vegetatively from underground adventitious or axillary buds, has been studied. In an outdoor pot experiment, emergence from defoliated plants with undisturbed underground systems was followed at two weeks intervals from late July to late January/April, for 2 years. During the second year, sprouting capacity from root and rhizome fragments was also tested. Emergence was impaired in Cirsium arvense, Equisetum arvense, Sonchus arvensis and Tussilago farfara during a period in September-October. This seasonality was, however, not preserved in C. arvense root buds after fragmentation of the root system. Fragmented rhizomes of Elytrigia repens, originating from southern Sweden, sprouted less readily in September-October. The shoot-to-rhizome ratio of this species was lowest during the same period. A climate chamber experiment suggested a photoperiodic control of sprouting from fragments of S. arvensis, with least sprouting in short photoperiods (12 h of light) combined with high temperature. None of the 12 combinations of photoperiods and temperatures used induced dormancy in C. arvense. In neither of the experiments could timing of dormancy onset be attributed to the latitudinal origin of the plants...|$|R

We monitored root demography of seven perennial herbs over {{two years in a}} cold temperate ecosystem and we classified the largest roots on the <b>root</b> collar <b>or</b> <b>rhizome</b> as basal <b>roots,</b> and associated finer laterals as secondary, tertiary and quaternary roots. Parallel to woody plants in which distal root orders form a fast-cycling module, basal root and its finer laterals also represent a fast-cycling module in herbaceous plants. Within this module, basal roots had a lifespan of 0. 5 - 2 years and represented 62 - 87 % of total root biomass, thus dominating annual root turnover (60 %- 81 % of the total). Moreover, root traits including root length, tissue density, and biomass were useful predictors of root lifespan. We conclude that both herbaceous and woody plants have fast-cycling modular units and future studies identifying the fast-cycling module across plant species should allow better understanding of how root construction and turnover are linked to whole-plant strategies...|$|R
