5|$|Hopsin {{detailed}} the album to The Source saying, There's {{a variety of}} music on there. There's crazy, wild lyrics. There's sad, emotional lyrics and even funny lyrics. I got serious songs and sad songs. Just a big variety of everything. I wanted to show the full me. I {{have a lot of}} people who love me, but I have a lot of haters as well. There are at least one or two songs for someone that doesn't <b>really</b> <b>like</b> me or what I put out. I think they'll stumble across a couple songs that will make them go, oh ok, I fucks with him now. I kinda wanted to make an album to show my wide range of music that I can do. I just wanted to show the full me.|$|E
5|$|We knew {{we wanted}} to make a dance record. But you know, there's so many {{different}} levels of dance music and even different categories of house music. So, it was <b>really</b> <b>like,</b> what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E
5|$|Some {{critics have}} noted {{similarities}} between names in Septimus Heap {{and those in}} Harry Potter, such as Petroc Trelawney (Jenna's pet rock) and Sybill Trelawney (a professor in Harry Potter); also both series feature Boggarts (which are intelligent Marsh creatures in Septimus Heap and shape-shifters in Harry Potter). In response, British author Phil Knight has commented: The Petroc Trelawney in the Septimus Heap books is {{nothing at all to}} do with Professor Trelawney. He is a Radio 3 presenter who may well be known to Angie Sage personally, but otherwise will be known over the air. Think: why would Jenna call a pet rock 'Trelawney'? To a Radio 3 listener like me, it's perfectly logical... And as for Boggarts, they've been around here in the North of England for a long time. Manchester has Boggart Hole Clough, for example. They're not <b>really</b> <b>like</b> either Sage's or Rowling's creatures, but pre-exist either of them.|$|E

5000|$|In October 1974, Magnus {{left the}} Marine Corps for 15 months {{to work on}} Wall Street. According to Magnus, [...] "I {{realized}} three things: I <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> flying, I <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> leading people - especially Marines, and that Wall Street wasn’t for me." [...] When {{he returned to the}} Marines, Magnus became a weapons and tactics instructor for CH-46 helicopter aviators.|$|R
5|$|Chrissie {{discovers that}} Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is the mystery buyer of the pub, {{and she and}} Jake make a quick sale to Ian before fleeing the Square. At the airport, they see Sharon, Phil and Grant with the police. Sharon confronts and then punches Chrissie, who is then arrested for Den's murder. Chrissie says that she will only co-operate in {{exchange}} for a meeting with Sharon. This is earned, and she tries to make Sharon realise why she killed her father, to no avail. She reveals that she forged Den's signature on the document in which Den handed over the pub to Chrissie, thus the pub legally belongs to Sharon. Jake visits Chrissie in jail and asks her to marry him. She finds out that he has lost the £25,000 that was to be her bail money, and storms out of the visiting room, calling Jake an idiot. She begins plotting revenge on Sharon for sending her to prison by trying to force her to testify in court about what Den was <b>really</b> <b>like,</b> wanting to see Sharon crumble at confessing how he cheated and supposedly beat her mother (which he never did). After a week in prison, she gives up and dismisses her solicitor, and decides to plead guilty to murder. After an emotional farewell to Jake, she walks into her cell with a contented smile.|$|E

25|$|Kevin Godley recalled:We {{did a lot}} {{of tracks}} {{in a very short time}} – it was <b>really</b> <b>like</b> a machine. Twenty tracks in about two weeks – a lot of crap really – really shit. We used to do the voices, {{everything}} – it saved 'em money. We even did the female backing vocals.|$|E
5000|$|Michel Obiora said on Ben Trueman from BBC.com, [...] "Playing a gay {{character}} really {{brought out}} my feminine side and my girlfriend <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> it. She said I smiled {{a lot more}} and used my hands more to gesticulate. She <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> my camp side. She also thinks I take more time over my appearance now which I wasn't aware of." ...|$|R
50|$|On {{her first}} day at camp, Carson meets and hits it off with Penn (Michael Copon). They trade phone numbers, neither knowing {{the other is a}} member of their arch-rival squad. When Carson {{eventually}} does find out that Penn is a Jet, she gives him up although she <b>really</b> <b>likes</b> him. Penn <b>really</b> <b>likes</b> her too, but is just playing it cool around his squad.|$|R

25|$|Peter {{turns to}} his gay younger brother, Robbie (Andy Samberg), for advice on dealing with men. He makes a series of overtures toward various men, {{including}} Barry (Jon Favreau), the persistently hot-headed husband of Zooey's friend Denise (Jaime Pressly) who doesn't <b>really</b> <b>like</b> Peter all that much to begin with. A problem that only escalates when Peter inadvertently projectile-vomits on Barry after winning a beer-drinking contest and is kicked out of Barry's house.|$|E
25|$|In the {{isolation}} he felt after the Börne debacle, Marx's friendship {{came as a}} relief to Heine, since he did not <b>really</b> <b>like</b> the other radicals. On the other hand, he did not share Marx's faith in the industrial proletariat and remained {{on the fringes of}} socialist circles. The Prussian government, angry at the publication of Vorwärts, put pressure on France to deal with its authors and in January 1845 Marx was deported to Belgium. Heine could not be expelled from the country because he had the right of residence in France, having been born under French occupation. Thereafter Heine and Marx maintained a sporadic correspondence, but in time their admiration for one another faded. Heine always had mixed feelings about communism. He believed its radicalism and materialism would destroy much of the European culture that he loved and admired.|$|E
25|$|To gain back {{ground in}} Greece, Germany reluctantly began a Balkans Campaign {{alongside}} Italy which resulted {{also in the}} destruction of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1941 and the ceding of Dalmazia to Italy. Mussolini and Hitler compensated Croatian nationalists by endorsing the creation of the Independent State of Croatia under the extreme nationalist Ustaše. In order to receive the support of Italy, the Ustaše agreed to concede the main central portion of Dalmazia as well as various Adriatic Sea islands to Italy, as Dalmazia held a significant number of Italians. The ceding of the Adriatic Sea islands was considered by the Independent State of Croatia to be a minimal loss, as in exchange for those cessions they were allowed to annex all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, which led to the persecution of the Serb population there. Officially, the Independent State of Croatia was a kingdom and an Italian protectorate, ruled by Italian House of Savoy member Tomislav II of Croatia, but he never personally set foot on Croatian soil and the government was run by Ante Pavelić, the leader of the Ustaše. However, Italy did hold military control across all of Croatia's coast, which combined with Italian control of Albania and Montenegro gave Italy complete control of the Adriatic Sea, thus completing {{a key part of the}} Mare Nostrum policy of the Fascists. The Ustaše movement proved valuable to Italy and Germany as a means to counter Royalist Chetnik guerrillas (although they did work with them because they did not <b>really</b> <b>like</b> the Ustaše movement whom they left up to the Germans) and the communist Yugoslav Partisans under Josip Broz Tito who opposed the occupation of Yugoslavia.|$|E

500|$|... "I Love You" [...] is an electropop {{new wave}} song. Downes {{is also a}} vocalist on the track, which he sings through a vocoder. He said that [...] "I Love You" [...] was really about [...] "being {{on the road and}} making love to someone you don't <b>really</b> <b>like,</b> while all the time you're wanting to phone someone who's a long way off." ...|$|E
500|$|Feeling {{detached}} from the early 1980s mainstream gay culture, Morrissey wrote [...] "This Charming Man" [...] to evoke an older, more coded and self-aware underground scene. The singer said of the song's lyrics: [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>like</b> {{the idea of the}} male voice being quite vulnerable, of it being taken and slightly manipulated, rather than there being always this heavy machismo thing that just bores everybody." ...|$|E
5000|$|Levin {{met with}} President Donald Trump on March 7 in the Oval Office and chatted {{for an hour}} [...] Levin [...] "just <b>really</b> <b>likes</b> {{powerful}} people, and he <b>really</b> <b>likes</b> having friends who are powerful, and who better than the President of the United States? I think he’s just blinded {{by the fact that}} the President calls him on the phone. I think he just thinks that’s really cool,” a former staffer told ThinkProgress.|$|R

500|$|Harrison {{remembered the}} Reeperbahn and Grosse Freiheit {{as the best}} thing the group had ever seen, as it had so many neon lights, clubs and restaurants, {{although}} also saying, [...] "The whole area was full of transvestites and prostitutes and gangsters, but I couldn't {{say that they were}} the audience ... Hamburg was <b>really</b> <b>like</b> our apprenticeship, learning how to play in front of people." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon the album's {{release in}} January 1970, Malcolm Jones {{was shocked by}} the {{substandard}} musicianship on the Gilmour and Waters-produced songs: [...] "I felt angry. It's like dirty linen in public and very unnecessary and unkind". Gilmour said: [...] "Perhaps we were trying to show what Syd was <b>really</b> <b>like.</b> But perhaps we were trying to punish him". Waters was more positive: [...] "Syd is a genius".|$|E
500|$|In 2013, the band's twelfth studio album, Between Dog and Wolf, mixed by Joe Barresi, was {{released}} {{and became the}} band's most successful since The Love of Hopeless Causes 20 years earlier. [...] The album showed a marked shift away from the band's traditional sounds, including rhythms that were described as [...] "tribal", though Sullivan claimed they were merely different ways of using drums – [...] "We <b>really</b> <b>like</b> complex tom-tom rhythms, we <b>really</b> <b>like</b> that pounding (beat)". [...] A year later, Between Wine and Blood {{was released}}, including six previously unreleased studio tracks from the Between Dog and Wolf sessions, along with eleven live tracks from that album. [...] In October 2014, a documentary feature film about the band's career, Between Dog and Wolf: The New Model Army Story by director Matt Reid premiered at the Raindance Film Festival in London and the Festival du nouveau cinéma in Montreal. [...] The band's 14th studio album, Winter, was released on 26 August 2016. Winter was named the #1 album of 2016 by The Big Takeover.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2013, Cher reflected on how her voice had evolved {{during the course of}} her career, eventually getting stronger and suppler over the years. While she didn't <b>really</b> <b>like</b> it at the beginning, working with vocal coaches had made a significant difference; she stated in the Toronto Sun: [...] "It's so freaky because people my age are having to lose notes and I'm gaining notes, so that's pretty shocking." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Townsend {{announced}} that he was using other guitars besides his Peavey models, including two Sadowsky Telecaster models and a number of Framus semi-hollow body guitars. In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: [...] "The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can’t say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I <b>really</b> <b>like</b> that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V’s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I <b>really</b> <b>like,</b> regardless of brand." ...|$|E
500|$|Whereas {{the first}} song {{was a little bit}} more artistic and a little bit more soulful, and it has done everything, it {{probably}} exceeded my expectations, I mean, from the moment I was able to give it away.

It's just in time for summer and the type of experience that I want people {{to get out of the}} album.|$|E
