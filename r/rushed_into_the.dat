5|$|Captain Salmond rushed on {{deck and}} ordered the anchor to be dropped, the quarter-boats to be lowered, and a turn astern to be given by the engines. However, as the ship backed off the rock, the sea <b>rushed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> large hole made by the {{collision}} and the ship struck again, buckling the plates of the forward bilge and ripping open the bulkheads. Shortly, the forward compartments and the engine rooms were flooded, and over 100 soldiers were drowned in their berths.|$|E

5|$|Tech {{picked up}} a first down, then Chapman was forced to {{scramble}} for a first down after facing third and 10. Stopped inches short of gaining the first down, Tech risked turning the ball over by attempting to convert the fourth down. Unlike their previous try in the game, Tech was successful and the Hokies' drive continued. Tech continued to pick up yardage and first downs, advancing deep into the NC State side of the field. Inside the State 30-yard line, Tech quarterback Chapman was sacked for a 10-yard loss. He responded by throwing a 30-yard pass on the next play, driving Virginia Tech inside the State one-yard line. Williams <b>rushed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> end zone with 33seconds remaining in the quarter, cutting the Wolfpack lead to 2116. Virginia Tech elected to attempt a two-point conversion, which was unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|With about 10seconds left in {{the tenth}} round, Judah hit Mayweather with a low blow and {{followed}} it with a right hand {{to the back of}} Mayweather's head. As Mayweather hopped around the ring in pain, Steele called time to give Mayweather a rest period. Mayweather's uncle and trainer, Roger Mayweather, climbed into the ring and approached Judah. Yoel Judah entered the ring and threw a punch at Roger. At that point, members of both fighters' camps entered the ring and an all-out melee ensued. More than a dozen security officers and police officers <b>rushed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ring and managed to control the situation. After the ring was cleared, Roger Mayweather was ejected from the fight. Mayweather cruised through the last two rounds {{on his way to a}} unanimous decision victory by scores of 116–112, 117–111 and 119–109.|$|E
5|$|The show's title {{character}} is {{portrayed in the}} two pilots by Pal, the MGM film Lassie. Thereafter, five of his male descendants played the role. His son Lassie Junior performed through the Jeff years and first two Timmy years before retiring in 1959 to battle cancer. Though he recovered, Lassie Junior never worked the show again. His son Spook was <b>rushed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> series while his brother Baby was in training for the role. Spook was inadequately prepared and never became comfortable on the set after an overhead light crashed to the floor on his first day. Weatherwax, however, coaxed a natural and seemingly confident performance from the frightened dog, and some regard Spook's portrayal as Weatherwax's finest work. Spook played the role {{in the spring and}} fall of 1960. Baby, son of Lassie Junior and brother to Spook, worked the show for six years. He appeared in the last Timmy years, and two of the Forest Service seasons. Baby died at eight years of age, the only Lassie not to live at least seventeen years. He was followed in the role by Mire who played Lassie for five years. He portrayed the fictional collie in the syndicated seasons.|$|E

Two of the men stood near the doorway with their weapons, and Hodges' weapon came into contact with Girty's chest causing him, and his group, to retreat into the woods. Young Dimmick, anxious to the point of begging to leave, was then dispatched to Hennepin by horseback for help. The men at the cabin expected Dimmick to be shot as soon as he rode off, but he crossed the open prairie unscathed. Dimmick made the 16 mile (25.7km) journey and arrived in Hennepin to report the attack.|$|E

25|$|As part of {{his plan}} to seize his ally the Kingdom of Spain in a {{military}} coup, Emperor Napoleon ordered several key points, including Barcelona, to be captured in February 1808. On 29 February, General of Division Giuseppe Lechi's troops were moving through Barcelona. Lechi ordered a military review, and, as his soldiers marched past the main gate of the citadel, they suddenly veered left and <b>rushed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fortress. Without bloodshed, the Imperial troops hustled the stunned Spanish garrison out of the fortifications and occupied the place. Among other strong places, the French also seized San Sebastian, Pamplona and Figueras. On 2 May, the Spanish people rose in revolt against the French occupiers.|$|E
25|$|Humans have {{inhabited}} the land {{now known as}} Missouri for at least 12,000 years. The Mississippian culture built cities and mounds, before declining in the 1300s. When European explorers arrived in the 1600s they encountered the Osage and Missouria nations. The French established Louisiana, a part of New France, and founded Ste. Genevieve in 1735 and St. Louis in 1764. After {{a brief period of}} Spanish rule, the United States acquired the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Americans from the Upland South, including enslaved African Americans, <b>rushed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> new Missouri Territory. Many from Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee settled in the Boonslick area of Mid-Missouri. Soon after, heavy German immigration formed the Missouri Rhineland.|$|E
25|$|The {{council was}} criticised when it {{repeatedly}} deferred {{the decision to}} appoint Chan, stating that it should wait until a new provost was in place. The decision was repeatedly delayed through votes on 30 June and 28 July. Just after the council voted down a motion to stop delaying the appointment at the latter meeting, dozens of students <b>rushed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> conference room in protest. During the incident, council member Lo Chung-mau fell down and alleged he was pushed over. He said his knee was injured; he reported this {{to the police and}} was taken to hospital. Students' union president Billy Fung expressed disbelief that Lo was injured by a student. Online videos appeared to show Lo fainting or falling on his own.|$|E

25|$|Colonel Langen, {{observing the}} {{increased}} fury and obstinacy {{of the fight}} in Ligny, sent in the 1st Battalion of the 23rd Regiment, and the 2nd of the 3rd Elbe Landwehr: he then took up a position, with {{the remainder of his}} brigade, near the Mill of Bussy, into which he threw the 2nd Battalion of the 23rd Regiment. The 1st Battalion of the 23rd Regiment, having formed two columns, <b>rushed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> village, and, after crossing the stream, received a sharp fire from the windows of the houses on the opposite side. The left column of the battalion stormed a farm house, of which, after it had burst in the gates with hatchets, it gained possession, and thus protected the advance of the right column.|$|E
25|$|Beck {{probably}} witnessed {{his first}} cardiac arrest during his internship in 1922 {{while on the}} surgery service at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. During a urologic operation, the anaesthetist announced that the patient's heart had stopped.

Beck remained in total bewilderment as the fire department rescue squad <b>rushed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> operating room 15minutes later and applied oxygen-powered respirators to the patient's face. The patient died, but the episode left an indelible impression on him. Beck would go on to develop techniques to take back the management of cardiac arrest from the fire department and place it in the hands of surgeons.|$|E
25|$|About this time, the Light Cavalry Brigade of Colonel Makwitz, had {{completed}} his manoeuvre from the left, reached the right flank, and was formed {{up in two}} lines: also the four Battalions that had been detached from the 6th Brigade (General Krafft's), arrived upon the right of Saint-Amand-la-Haye, and came into action. The battle on both sides on {{this part of the}} Field continued to rage with unabated violence and with such indefatigable ardour did the Prussians continue the struggle, that when the fire of their skirmishers was observed to slacken, from the men having expended their ammunition, the soldiers of the 11th Hussars <b>rushed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> midst of them, and supplied them with such cartridges as they had of their own; an act of devotion to which many of them fell a sacrifice.|$|E
