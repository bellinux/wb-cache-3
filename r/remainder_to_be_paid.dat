2500|$|The primary slab {{remained}} in Germany {{in the possession}} of a private collector who kept it secret for twenty years before deciding to sell it anonymously via a German fossil dealer. Two German museums turned it down as too expensive.

50|$|When Richard I of England {{realised}} that Cyprus {{would prove}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a difficult territory {{to maintain and}} oversee whilst launching offensives in the Holy Land, he sold it to the Knights Templar for a fee of 100,000 bezants, 40,000 of which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> immediately, while the <b>remainder</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> in installments. One of the greatest military orders of medieval times, the Knights Templar were renowned for their remarkable financial power and vast holdings of land and property throughout Europe and the East, and their severity of rule in Cyprus quickly incurred the hatred of the native population. On Easter Day in 1192, the Cypriots attempted a massacre of their Templar rulers, however due to prior knowledge of the attack and limited amounts of troops, the Knights had taken refuge in their stronghold at Nicosia. A siege ensued and the Templars, realising their dire circumstances and their besiegers’ reluctance to bargain, sallied {{out into the streets}} at dawn one morning, taking the Cypriots completely by surprise. The subsequent slaughter was merciless and widespread and though Templar rule was restored following the event, the military order <b>was</b> reluctant <b>to</b> continue rule and allegedly begged Richard to take Cyprus back. Richard took them up on the offer and the Templars returned to Syria, retaining but a few holdings on the island. A small minority Roman Catholic population of the island <b>was</b> mainly confined <b>to</b> some coastal cities, such as Famagusta, as well as inland Nicosia, the traditional capital. Roman Catholics kept the reins of power and control, while the Orthodox inhabitants lived in the countryside; this was much the same as the arrangement in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The independent Eastern Orthodox Church of Cyprus, with its own archbishop and subject <b>to</b> no patriarch, <b>was</b> allowed <b>to</b> remain on the island, but the Roman Catholic Latin Church largely displaced it in stature and holding property.|$|R

5000|$|The events {{regarding}} the original unearthing of the fossil are not clear, though some facts are known. It {{was found at}} the Messel pit in 1983, a disused shale quarry noted for its astonishing fossil preservation, {{near the village of}} Messel about 35 km southeast of Frankfurt am Main in Germany. The fossil came as a slab and partial counter slab and was expertly prepared by encasing each slab in resin using the transfer technique necessary to conserve Messel fossils. At some point the slab and counter slab went separate ways. The counter slab was incorporated in a composite of fabricated parts to represent a complete specimen and arrived at a private Wyoming museum in 1991. Analysis by Jens Franzen of the Natural History Museum of Basel, Switzerland revealed the mixed actual and faked nature of this slab. A comparison of the two slabs indicates that the forger had access to the whole fossil.The primary slab remained in Germany in the possession of a private collector who kept it secret for twenty years before deciding to sell it anonymously via a German fossil dealer. Two German museums turned it down as too expensive. A year later at the Hamburg Fossil and Mineral Fair in December 2006, the dealer asked Norwegian vertebrate palaeontologist Jørn Hurum, who had done some previous deals, to discuss something privately. The dealer showed Hurum three high resolution colour photographs of the fossil and told him that the asking price was $1 million.

On October 17, 2005, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved Nigeria’s request for a Policy Support Instrument (PSI), thereby documenting Nigeria as the first user of the new IMF program. Following {{the approval of the}} PSI, Nigeria signed an agreement with its Paris Club creditors on October 20 2005 under which approximately 60 % of its $ 30 bn debt was written off on Naples terms, with the <b>remainder</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>paid</b> back in two tranches over 6 months. Obtaining approval for its economic reform program through the Policy Support Instrument was one of the conditions for Nigeria’s debt restructuring negotiations with the Paris Club. The PSI is a voluntary instrument requested {{by a member of the}} IMF in order to get IMF approval for its economic policies. According to the ‘PSI Factsheet’ on the IMF website, the PSI which was introduced in October 2005 to “enable[] the IMF [] support low-income countries that do not want or need Fund financial assistance”. “The PSI will help countries design effective economic programs, and, once approved by the IMF’s Executive Board, will signal to donors, multilateral development banks, and markets the Fund’s endorsement of a member’s policies”. This paper intends to discuss the PSI using Nigeria as a reference point. What exactly is the PSI about and what is its purpose? How is it different from similar IMF instrument(s) which are currently operational? What is the modus operandi of the PSI? What are the eligibility criteria for the PSI? What is the standard of assessment to be used in evaluating a PSI? These and more will be the focus of this research paper...|$|E
