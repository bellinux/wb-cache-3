5|$|Samakh, in {{the centre}} of a rearguard line {{stretching}} from Tiberias through Samakh and on to Deraa was intended to cover the <b>retreat</b> <b>of</b> three Ottoman armies.

5|$|A {{traveller}} called Demetrius of Tarsus {{related to}} Plutarch {{the tale of}} an expedition {{to the west coast}} of Scotland in or shortly before AD 83.

5|$|As initial {{cause for}} glacier retreat {{in the alps}} since 1850, a {{decrease}} of the glaciers albedo, caused by industrial black carbon can be identified.

5|$|Details on the <b>retreat</b> <b>of</b> Siberian and Russian Far East glaciers less {{adequate}} than in {{most other}} glaciated areas of the world. There are several reasons for this, the principal one being that {{since the collapse of}} Communism there has been a large {{reduction in the number of}} monitoring stations. Another factor is that in the Verkhoyansk and Cherskiy Ranges it was thought glaciers were absent before they were discovered during the 1940s, whilst in ultra-remote Kamchatka and Chukotka, although the existence of glaciers was known earlier, monitoring of their size dates back no earlier than the end of World War II. Nonetheless, available records do indicate a general <b>retreat</b> <b>of</b> all glaciers in the Altai Mountains with the exception of volcanic glaciers in Kamchatka. Sakha’s glaciers, totaling seventy square kilometers, have shrunk by around 28percent since 1945 reaching several percent annually in some places, whilst in the Altai and Chukotkan mountains and non-volcanic areas of Kamchatka, the shrinkage is considerably larger.|$|E
25|$|The Dundas Valley is a glacial {{re-entrant}} valley, {{formed by}} several advances and <b>retreats</b> <b>of</b> an ice lobe.

25|$|The {{war against}} the French was itself brought to a not-too-devastating end for the Dutch Republic with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748).

50|$|Between {{two million}} years ago the Pleistocene epoch, {{glaciation}} {{took place in the}} area. Large parts of northern North America were repeatedly covered with glacial ice sheets, at times reaching over 10,000 ft in thickness. Periodic climate changes resulted in corresponding advances and <b>retreats</b> <b>of</b> ice.|$|R
5|$|Differentiating {{the various}} periods {{of human history}} {{involved}} is a complex task. The Paleolithic lasted until the <b>retreat</b> <b>of</b> the ice, the Mesolithic until the adoption of farming and the Neolithic until metalworking commenced. These events may have begun at different times {{in different parts of}} the country. A number of the sites span very long periods of time and in particular the distinctions between the Neolithic and the later periods are not clear cut.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Hessen saw {{action in}} the Battle of Jutland as the second ship of the III Division of the II Battle Squadron. In the last daytime action between capital ships at Jutland, Hessen and the other pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron covered the <b>retreat</b> <b>of</b> Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's {{battered}} battlecruisers from Vice Admiral David Beatty's battlecruiser squadron. After the battle, the vessel was disarmed and used as a depot ship.|$|E

50|$|Roman villas {{in northwestern}} Gaul (modern France) functioned as colonial {{economic}} centers. Most villas did not resemble the luxurious, aristocratic country <b>retreats</b> <b>of</b> the Mediterranean region.

5|$|Given {{its large}} Greek population, {{the city was}} claimed and taken by Greece during the First Balkan War of 1912–1913, {{following}} the <b>retreat</b> <b>of</b> the Ottomans from the region.

5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Scotland the Firth of Clyde was covered by ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages and the {{landscape}} is much affected by glaciation. Arran's highest peaks may have been nunataks at this time. After the last <b>retreat</b> <b>of</b> the ice sea level changes and the isostatic rise of land makes charting post glacial coastlines a complex task but the resultant clifflines behind raised beaches are a prominent feature of the entire coastline.|$|E
5|$|In its {{southern}} range Tyrannosaurus lived alongside the titanosaur Alamosaurus, the ceratopsians Torosaurus, Bravoceratops and Ojoceratops, hadrosaurs {{which consisted of}} a species of Edmontosaurus, Kritosaurus and a possible species of Gryposaurus, the nodosaur Glyptodontopelta, the oviraptorid Ojoraptosaurus, possible species of the theropods Troodon and Richardoestesia, and the pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus. The region {{is thought to have}} been dominated by semi-arid inland plains, following the probable <b>retreat</b> <b>of</b> the Western Interior Seaway as global sea levels fell.|$|E
50|$|Mansions built {{during and}} after the 19th century were seldom {{supported}} by the large estates of their predecessors.
