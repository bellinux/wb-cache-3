At least when the composite is intended to operate between approximately 1500 and 2000 degrees centigrade for extended periods of time the solid carbide with the embedded reinforcement is formed first by reaction infiltration. Molten silicon is then diffused into the carbide. The molten silicon diffuses preferentially into the carbide matrix but not to any significant degree into the carbon-carbon reinforcement.

40|$|Toughness {{of metal}} fibre/ceramic matrix {{composites}} (MFCs) after severe heat treatments S. K. Lam and T. W. Clyne* This paper concerns {{the effect of}} heat treatment on the toughness of metal fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>composite.</b> Drawn fibres of 304 and 310 stainless steel have been used. Their response to heat treatment in air has been investigated, {{in terms of both}} oxidation kinetics and tensile properties. This has been correlated with measured fracture energies of composite containing these fibres, after similar heat treatments. As received, 304 fibres exhibit greater ductility and work of deformation than 310 fibres. However, severe heat treatments (up to 1170 uC) cause 304 fibres to become oxidised and embrittled, whereas 310 fibres retain good strength and ductility. Composites subjected to these heat treatments become embrittled when they contain 304 fibres, but retain their toughness when reinforced with 310 fibres. These data are consistent with predictions from a previously published model of the fracture process, based on energy absorption being dominated by fibre pullout and/or fibre plasticity...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of high fracture toughness and reliability in Si 3 N 4, and SiC-based structural ceramics and ceramic matrix composites is reviewed. The potential of these ceramics and ceramic matrix composites for high temperature applications in defense and aerospace {{applications such as}} gas turbine engines, radomes, and other energy conversion hardware have been well recognized. Numerous investigations were pursued to improve fracture toughness and reliability by incorporating various reinforcements such as particulate-, whisker-, and continuous fiber into Si 3 N 4 and SiC matrices. All toughening mechanisms, e. g. crack deflection, crack branching, crack bridging, etc., essentially redistribute stresses at the crack tip and increase the energy needed to propagate a crack through the composite material, thereby resulting in improved fracture toughness and reliability. Because of flaw insensitivity, continuous fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>composite</b> (CFCC) {{was found to have}} the highest potential for higher operating temperature and longer service conditions. However, the ceramic fibers should display sufficient high temperature strength and creep resistance at service temperatures above 1000 'C. The greatest challenge to date is the development of high quality ceramic fibers with associate coatings able to maintain their high strength in oxidizing environment at high temperature. In the area of processing, critical issues are, preparation of optimum matrix precursors, precursor infiltration into fiber array, and matrix densification at a temperature, where grain crystallization and fiber degradation do not occur. A broad scope of effort is required for improved processing and properties with a better understanding of all candidate composite systems...|$|E
40|$|Ceramic {{composites}} {{are presently}} being developed for high temperature use in heat engine and space power system applications. The {{operating temperature range}} {{is expected to be}} 1090 to 1650 C (2000 F to 3000 F). Very little material data is available at these temperatures and, therefore, it is desirable to thoroughly characterize the basic unidirectional fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>composite.</b> This includes testing mainly for mechanical material properties at high temperatures. The proper conduct of such characterization tests requires the development of a tensile testing system includes unique gripping, heating, and strain measuring devices which require special considerations. The system also requires an optimized specimen shape. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review various techniques for measuring displacements or strains, preferably at elevated temperatures. Due to current equipment limitations it is assumed that the specimen is to be tested at a temperature of 1430 C (2600 F) in an oxidizing atmosphere. For the most part, previous high temperature material characterization tests, such as flexure and tensile tests, have been performed in inert atmospheres. Due to the harsh environment in which the ceramic specimen is to be tested, many conventional strain measuring techniques can not be applied. Initially a brief description of the more commonly used mechanical strain measuring techniques is given. Major advantages and disadvantages with their application to high temperature tensile testing of ceramic composites are discussed. Next, a general overview is given for various optical techniques. Advantages and disadvantages which are common to these techniques are noted. The optical methods for measuring strain or displacement are categorized into two sections. These include real-time techniques. Finally, an optical technique which offers optimum performance with the high temperature tensile testing of ceramic composites is recommended...|$|E

40|$|NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is {{developing}} a variety of advanced SiC/SiC ceramic composite (ASC) systems that allow these materials to operate for hundreds of hours under stress in air at temperatures approaching 2700 F. These SiC/SiC composite systems are lightweight (approximately 30 % metal density) and, in comparison to monolithic ceramics and carbon fiber-reinforced ceramic composites, are able to reliably retain their structural properties for long times under aggressive gas-turbine engine environments. The key for the ASC systems is related first to the NASA development of the Sylramic-iBN Sic fiber, which displays higher thermal stability than any other SiC- based ceramic fibers and possesses an in-situ grown BN surface layer for higher environmental durability. This fiber is simply derived from Sylramic Sic fiber type that is currently produced at ATK COI Ceramics (COIC). Further capability is then derived by using chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) and/or polymer infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) to form a Sic-based matrix with high creep and rupture resistance as well as high thermal conductivity. The objectives {{of this study were}} (1) to optimize the constituents and processing parameters for a Sylramic-iBN fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>composite</b> system in which the Sic-based matrix is formed at COIC almost entirely by PIP (full PIP approach), (2) to evaluate the properties of this system in comparison to other 2700 F Sylramic-iBN systems in which the matrix is formed by full CVI and CVI + PIP, and (3) to examine {{the pros and cons of}} the full PIP approach for fabricating hot-section engine components. A key goal is the development of a composite system with low porosity, thereby providing high modulus, high matrix cracking strength, high interlaminar strength, and high thermal conductivity, a major property requirement for engine components that will experience high thermal gradients during service. Other key composite property goals are demonstration at high temperatures of high environmental resistance and high creep resistance, which in turn will result in long component life. Data are presented from a variety of laboratory tests on simple two-dimensional panels that examine these properties and compare the performance of the optimized full PIP system with those of the full CVI and CVI + PIP hybrid systems. Underlying mechanisms for performance differences in the various systems are discussed. Remaining issues for further property enhancement and for application of the full PIP approach for engine components are also discussed, as well as on-going approaches at NASA to solve these issues...|$|E

Gaseous precursors containing the elements to be deposited are pyrolysed at the heated substrate or, alternatively, by exciting the molecules with laser photons or by a plasma. Although the techniques are used on a technological scale, the underlying chemistry is not completely understood. The goal of the presentation is to improve CVD process control by a multipurpose, knowledge based feedback system for monitoring the CVD/CVI process with in-situ FTIR spectroscopic data as input information. In the presentation, three commonly used, and distinctly different, types of industrial CVD/CVI processes are taken as test cases: (i) a thermal high capacity CVI batch p rocess for manufacturing carbon fibre reinforced SiC composites for high temperature applications, (ii) a continuously driven CVD thermal process for coating float glass for energy protection, and (iii) a laser stimulated CVD process for continuously coating bundles of thin ceramic fibres (i) The CVI process operates near 1000 oC, in the low pressure region and with CH 3 SiCl 3 (MTS) as a SiC precursor. Using FTIR emission spectroscopy, several gaseous species have been detected including MTS, SiCl 2, (SiCl 3) n= 1, 2, SiCl 4, HSiCl 3, CH 4, CH 3 Cl and HCl which, consequently, can be monitored simultaneously. (ii) The CVD process operates at atmospheric pressure. A model reactor has been developed for studying the concentration dependence of FTIR emission spectra. The measured spectra are compared with calculated spectra which have been derived by optical modelling of a multilayer based optical model. (iii) Based on an industrial 6 kW cw-CO 2 - laser, a laser driven process currently runs in a prototy pe coater.

The design of the LCVD reactor and the optimization of its operational conditions are supported by computational fluid dynamics techniques. The gas flow dynamics, concentration of species and heat tranfer in the reaction chamber have been calculated. Within the symmetrical chamber a flow regime is established with a free standing laminar gas flow around the fibre tape which shields the reaction zone against purge gases. The diffusion limited deposition rate of this configuration is estimated. The influence of laser irradiation on mechanical properties {{and structure of the}} carbon fibres have been checked by tensile (bundle) testing, SEM/EDX, XRD and Raman spectroscopy. The detected changes indicate a complex dependence on irradiation time, laser power and gaseous ambient...|$|R
40|$|Development {{of the hot}} gas {{filtration}} technology {{has been the focus}} of DOE/FETC and Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation during the past twenty years. Systems development during this time has successfully lead to the generation and implementation of high temperature Siemens Westinghouse particulate filtration systems that are currently installed and are operational at Demonstration Plant sites, and which are ready for installation at commercial plant sites. Concurrently, materials development has advanced the use of commercially available oxide- and nonoxide-based monoliths, and has fostered the manufacture and use of second generation, oxide-based, continuous fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>ceramic</b> <b>composites</b> and filament wound materials. This report summarizes the material characterization results for commercially available and second generation filter materials tested in Siemens Westinghouse's advanced, high temperature, particulate removal system at the Foster Wheeler, pressurized circulating fluidized-bed combustion, pilot-scale test facility in Karhula, Finland, and subsequent extended accelerated life testing of aged elements in Siemens Westinghouse pressurized fluidized-bed combustion simulator test facility in Pittsburgh, PA. The viability of operating candle filters successfully for over 1 year of service life has been shown in these efforts. Continued testing to demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring three years of service operation on aged filter elements is recommended...|$|R
40|$|A {{program to}} {{establish}} the potential for introducing fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>ceramic</b> matrix <b>composites</b> (FRCMC) in future rocket engine turbopumps was instituted in 1987. A brief summary of the overall program (both contract and in-house research) is presented. Tests at NASA Lewis include thermal upshocks in a hydrogen/oxygen test rig capable of generating heating rates up to 2500 C/sec. Post thermal upshock exposure evaluation includes the measurement of residual strength and failure analysis. Test results for monolithic ceramics and several FRCMC are presented. Hydrogen compatibility was assessed by isothermal exposure of monolithic ceramics in high temperature gaseous hydrogen plus water vapor...|$|R
