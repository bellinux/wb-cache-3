25|$|A 2005 review {{determined}} that some, but not all, randomized controlled {{studies have found}} that AAS use correlates with hypomania and increased aggressiveness, but pointed out that attempts to determine whether AAS use triggers violent behavior have failed, primarily because of high rates of non-participation. A 2008 study on a nationally representative sample of young adult males in the United States found an association between lifetime and past-year self-reported AAS use and involvement in violent acts. Compared with individuals that did not use steroids, young adult males that used AAS <b>reported</b> <b>greater</b> involvement in violent behaviors even after controlling for the effects of key demographic variables, previous violent behavior, and polydrug use. A 1996 review examining the blind studies available at that time also found that these had demonstrated a link between aggression and steroid use, but pointed out that with estimates of over one million past or current steroid users in the United States at that time, an extremely small percentage of those using steroids appear to have experienced mental disturbance severe enough to result in clinical treatments or medical case reports.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a variety}} of {{findings}} contradict {{the claims of the}} social activity hypothesis. Firstly, it was found that extraverts were happier than introverts even when alone. Specifically, extraverts tend to be happier regardless of whether they live alone or with others, or whether they live in a vibrant city or quiet rural environment. Similarly, a study by Diener, Sandvik, Pavot, and Fujita (1992) showed that although extraverts chose social jobs relatively more frequently (51%) than nonsocial jobs compared to introverts (38%), they were happier than introverts regardless of whether their occupations had social or nonsocial character. Secondly, it was found that extraverts only sometimes <b>reported</b> <b>greater</b> amounts of social activity than introverts, but in general extraverts and introverts do not differ in the quantity of their socialization. Similar finding was reported by Srivastava, Angelo, and Vallereux (2008), who found that extraverts and introverts both enjoy participating in social interactions, but extraverts participate socially more. Thirdly, studies have shown that both extraverts and introverts participate in social relations, but that the quality of this participation differs. The more frequent social participation among extraverts could be {{explained by the fact that}} extraverts know more people, but those people are not necessarily their close friends, whereas introverts, when participating in social interactions, are more selective and have only few close friends with whom they have special relationships.|$|E

40|$|Around the world, {{increases}} in wealth have produced an unintended consequence: a rising {{sense of time}} scarcity. We provide evidence that using money to buy time can provide a buffer against this time famine, thereby promoting happiness. Using large, diverse samples from the United States, Canada, Denmark, and The Netherlands (n = 6, 271), we show that individuals who spend money on time-saving services <b>report</b> <b>greater</b> life satisfaction. A field experiment provides causal evidence that working adults <b>report</b> <b>greater</b> happiness after spending money on a time-saving purchase than on a material purchase. Together, {{these results suggest that}} using money to buy time can protect people from the detrimental effects of time pressure on life satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the rise and}} use of balanced scorecard performance measurement systems in Australian government departments. Through a survey of all Australian federal, state and territory government departments we find that Australian government departments include a broad set of financial and non-financial measures within a balanced scorecard approach. Theoretically, our findings lend support for both economic and ‘external’ institutional rationales for the implementation and use of balanced scorecard measures. We find that those government departments <b>reporting</b> <b>greater</b> implementation of balanced scorecard performance measures also <b>report</b> <b>greater</b> benefits for organisational decisions. Our findings {{shed light on the}} use, and further potential, of BSC performance measurement systems as part of the management control system in Government departments...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to examine the {{following}} question: What is the relationship between parental interest and control over their adolescent children, and juvenile delinquency? Two hypotheses were tested: (1) fewer adolescents who <b>report</b> <b>greater</b> parental control will report engaging in delinquent behavior than adolescents who report less parental control; and (2), fewer adolescents who <b>report</b> <b>greater</b> parental interest will report engaging in delinquent behavior than adolescents who report less parental control. Approximately 7, 000 high school students responded to a four-page questionnaire containing self-report questions onjuvenile delinquency, parental control, and parental interest. Results indicated little, if any, support for the two;hypotheses. However, when using individual items which were combined to create the overall rating scales, almost every relationship was significant. The author discusses the reasons for these results.

50|$|Findings by King and colleagues, {{which are}} largely corroborated {{by a recent}} meta-analysis, suggest that the Differentiator Model best characterizes heavy {{drinkers}} at risk for developing alcohol use disorder.
