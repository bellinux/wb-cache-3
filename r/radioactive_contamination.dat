5|$|In {{addition}} to the major tests, {{a large number of}} minor trials were also carried out, from June 1955 and extended through to April 1963. Although the major tests had been carried out with some publicity, the minor tests were carried out in absolute secrecy. These minor tests left a dangerous legacy of <b>radioactive</b> <b>contamination</b> at Maralinga.|$|E
5|$|The 1969 fire raised public {{awareness}} of potential hazards posed by the plant and led to years of increasing citizen protests and demands for plant closure. Releases from previous years had not been reported publicly prior to the fire; airborne-become-groundborne <b>radioactive</b> <b>contamination</b> extending well beyond the Rocky Flats plant was not publicly reported until the 1970s.|$|E
30|$|Background, aim, and scopeIn the {{district}} List of Hanover (Lower Saxony) <b>radioactive</b> <b>contaminations</b> {{of the ground}} were detected at a site of a former chemical plant. Due {{to the lack of}} an ordinance regarding intervention regulations in the case of <b>radioactive</b> <b>contaminations</b> in Germany this situation had to be assessed on the basis of scales and methods of the German regulations concerning soil protection and contaminated sites. In particular it was necessary to develop methods and levels for the assessment of <b>radioactive</b> <b>contaminations.</b>|$|R
30|$|Materials and methodsBecause {{radioactivity}} can {{be considered}} as a carcinogenic substance the methodical approaches of the BBodSchV for this group of substances were used in order to derive test thresholds for <b>radioactive</b> <b>contaminations</b> at children’s play areas, residential areas as well as parks and recreation facilities.|$|R
30|$|ConclusionsThe {{approach}} of test thresholds for <b>radioactive</b> soil <b>contamination</b> presented in Part 1 {{of this paper}} complies with the criteria of the German methods for calculation of test thresholds in soil protection regarding plausibility and feasibility. It enables the soil protection authorities to assess <b>radioactive</b> <b>contaminations</b> of the ground according to the established rules {{in the field of}} soil protection and to make decisions according to Articles 9 and 10 of the German Soil Protection Act. Part 3 of this paper discusses the application of the test thresholds and the possibilities of determining the need for remediation actions.|$|R
5|$|The Rocky Flats Plant was {{a former}} U.S. nuclear weapons {{production}} facility about 15 miles northwest of Denver, Colorado, which caused <b>radioactive</b> <b>contamination,</b> primarily plutonium, americium, and uranium, within and outside its boundaries. The facility was dismantled and removed, and the central industrial area of the property became a Superfund site, surrounded by the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E
5|$|After {{delivery}} of the barium-lanthanum material to Los Alamos, it was stored in a dedicated building in the Bayo Canyon Site. At first, the mixture was used as-is, both barium and lanthanum together, but this led to unpleasant <b>radioactive</b> <b>contamination</b> that {{took a long time}} to disappear as the half-life of barium-140 is 12.5 days. Shortly after, the process was improved; barium was removed chemically, by double precipitation from a solution as barium sulfate.|$|E
5|$|Most of the <b>radioactive</b> <b>contamination</b> from Rocky Flats {{came from}} three sources: a catastrophic fire in 1957, leaking barrels in an outdoor storage area in 1964-1968, and another less severe fire in 1969. Plutonium, used to {{construct}} the weapons' fissile components, can spontaneously combust at room temperatures in air. Additional sources of actinide contamination include inadequate pondcrete vitrification attempts and routine releases during the decades of plant operations.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} what human organs are {{affected}} by interaction with promethium; a possible candidate is the bone tissues. Sealed promethium-147 is not dangerous. However, if the packaging is damaged, then promethium becomes dangerous {{to the environment and}} humans. If <b>radioactive</b> <b>contamination</b> is found, the contaminated area should be washed with water and soap, but, even though promethium mainly affects the skin, the skin should not be abraded. If a promethium leak is found, the area should be identified as hazardous and evacuated, and emergency services must be contacted. No dangers from promethium aside from the radioactivity are known.|$|E
5|$|On 21 January 1968, a B-52G, {{with four}} nuclear bombs aboard {{as part of}} Operation Chrome Dome, crashed on the ice of the North Star Bay while {{attempting}} an emergency landing at Thule Air Base, Greenland. The resulting fire caused extensive <b>radioactive</b> <b>contamination,</b> the cleanup (Project Crested Ice) lasting until September of that year. Following closely on the Palomares incident, the cleanup costs and political consequences proved too high to risk again, so SAC ended the airborne alert program the following day.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled with {{was how to}} deal with <b>radioactive</b> <b>contamination.</b> Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as a gasket material, and closed-circuit television, used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.|$|E

25|$|The {{first study}} {{of the effects of}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>contamination</b> {{following}} the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster suggested, through standard point count censuses that the abundance of birds was negatively correlated with <b>radioactive</b> <b>contamination,</b> and that among the 14 species in common between the Fukushima and the Chernobyl regions, the decline in abundance was presently steeper in Fukushima. However criticism of this conclusion is that naturally there would be less bird species living on a smaller amount of land, that is, in the most contaminated areas, than the number one would find living in a larger body of land, that is, in the broader area.|$|E

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2011, the former Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (FZD) was fully integrated into the Helmholtz Association, as Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR). Therefore, the present Annual Report 2010 of the Institute of Radiochemistry (IRC) is published as the first HZDR-Report. The Institute of Radiochemistry {{is one of the}} six Research Institutes of this centre. IRC contributes to the research program “Nuclear Safety Research” in the “Research Field of Energy” and performs basic and applied research in radiochemistry and radioecology. Motivation and background of our research are environmental processes relevant for the installation of nuclear waste repositories, for remediation of uranium mining and milling sites, and for <b>radioactive</b> <b>contaminations</b> caused by nuclear accidents and fallout.

50|$|Whether {{the model}} {{describes}} the reality for small-dose exposures is disputed. It opposes two competing schools of thought: the threshold model, which assumes that very small exposures are harmless, and the radiation hormesis model, which claims that radiation at very small doses can be beneficial. Because the current data are inconclusive, scientists disagree on which model should be used. Pending any definitive answer {{to these questions}} and the precautionary principle, the model is sometimes used to quantify the cancerous effect of collective doses of low-level <b>radioactive</b> <b>contaminations,</b> even though it estimates a positive number of excess deaths at levels that would have had zero deaths, or saved lives, in the two other models. Such practice has been condemned by the International Commission on Radiological Protection.|$|R

Energy deposition in the detectors is recorded via the simultaneous measurement of a phonon-mediated signal and scintillation emitted by the CaWO(4) crystal targets.
