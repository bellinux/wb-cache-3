5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in helium is nearly three times the {{speed of sound}} in air. Because the {{fundamental}} frequency of a gas-filled cavity is proportional to {{the speed of sound}} in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the <b>resonant</b> frequencies of the vocal tract. The fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) does not change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds, which is unchanged. However, the higher <b>resonant</b> frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering <b>resonant</b> frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.|$|E

5|$|A Faraday filter, {{magneto-optical}} filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday Dispersive Optical Filter) {{works by}} rotating the polarization {{of the light}} passing through the vapor cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic absorption lines by the Faraday effect and anomalous dispersion. Only light at the <b>resonant</b> frequency of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect, or the splitting of atomic absorption lines {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field. Light at the <b>resonant</b> frequency of the vapor exits a FADOF near its original strength but with an orthogonal polarization.|$|E

5|$|By the 1890s {{electrical}} resonance {{was much}} more widely understood and had become {{a normal part of}} the engineer's toolkit. In 1891 Hutin and Leblanc patented an FDM scheme for telephone circuits using <b>resonant</b> circuit filters. Rival patents were filed in 1892 by Michael Pupin and John Stone Stone with similar ideas, priority eventually being awarded to Pupin. However, no scheme using just simple <b>resonant</b> circuit filters can successfully multiplex (i.e. combine) the wider bandwidth of telephone channels (as opposed to telegraph) without either an unacceptable restriction of speech bandwidth or a channel spacing so wide as to make the benefits of multiplexing uneconomic.|$|E

5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of resonance to filter signals. Although electrical resonance had been investigated by researchers from a very early stage, it was at first not widely understood by electrical engineers. Consequently, the much more familiar concept of acoustic resonance (which in turn, can be {{explained in terms of}} the even more familiar mechanical resonance) found its way into filter design ahead of electrical resonance. Resonance can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the <b>resonant</b> device will respond to frequencies at, or near, to the <b>resonant</b> frequency but will not respond to frequencies far from resonance. Hence frequencies far from resonance are filtered out from the output of the device.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Hertz (1887) {{experimentally}} {{demonstrated the}} resonance phenomena by building two <b>resonant</b> circuits, {{one of which}} was driven by a generator and the other was tunable and only coupled to the first electromagnetically (i.e., no circuit connection). Hertz showed that the response of the second circuit was at a maximum when it was in tune with the first. The diagrams produced by Hertz in this paper were the first published plots of an electrical <b>resonant</b> response.|$|E
5|$|So far, the {{investigation}} {{had been on}} the natural frequency of transient oscillation of a <b>resonant</b> circuit resulting from a sudden stimulus. More important {{from the point of view}} of filter theory is the behaviour of a <b>resonant</b> circuit when driven by an external AC signal: there is a sudden peak in the circuit's response when the driving signal frequency is at the <b>resonant</b> frequency of the circuit. James Clerk Maxwell heard of the phenomenon from Sir William Grove in 1868 in connection with experiments on dynamos, and was also aware of the earlier work of Henry Wilde in 1866. Maxwell explained resonance mathematically, with a set of differential equations, in much the same terms that an RLC circuit is described today.|$|E

Another common distinction is between occlusives (stops and nasals) and continuants (all else); affricates {{are considered to be}} both, because they are sequences of stop plus fricative.|$|R
5|$|Although motions in the {{scattered}} disc are random, they {{do tend to}} follow similar directions, which means that SDOs can become trapped in temporary resonances with Neptune. Examples of <b>resonant</b> orbits within {{the scattered}} disc include 1:3, 2:7, 3:11, 5:22 and 4:79.|$|E
5|$|Planet Nine modifies {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects via a {{combination}} of secular and <b>resonant</b> dynamics. The secular dynamics acts on very long timescales and causes {{the distance of the}} perihelia of anti-aligned objects to rise and fall while the directions of their perihelia oscillate. The <b>resonant</b> dynamics acts on shorter timescales and provides phase protection, maintaining the stability of the objects by preventing close approaches. The inclination of Planet Nine's orbit weakens this protection, resulting in a chaotic variation of semi-major axes as objects hop between resonances. The orbital poles of the objects circle that of the Solar System's Laplace plane, which is bent toward the plane of Planet Nine's orbit, causing their poles to be clustered toward one side.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{technical}} {{reason for this}} difficulty is that the frequency response of a simple filter approaches a fall of 6 dB/octave far {{from the point of}} resonance. This means that if telephone channels are squeezed in side-by-side into the frequency spectrum, there will be crosstalk from adjacent channels in any given channel. What is required is a much more sophisticated filter that has a flat frequency response in the required passband like a low-Q <b>resonant</b> circuit, but that rapidly falls in response (much faster than 6dB/octave) at the transition from passband to stopband like a high-Q <b>resonant</b> circuit. Obviously, these are contradictory requirements to be met with a single <b>resonant</b> circuit. The solution to these needs was founded in the theory of transmission lines and consequently the necessary filters did not become available until this theory was fully developed. At this early stage the idea of signal bandwidth, and hence the need for filters to match to it, was not fully understood; indeed, it was as late as 1920 before the concept of bandwidth was fully established. For early radio, the concepts of Q-factor, selectivity and tuning sufficed. This was all to change with the developing theory of transmission lines on which image filters are based, as explained in the next section.|$|E

5|$|The {{long term}} {{stability}} of anti-aligned extreme trans-Neptunian objects with orbits that intersect that of Planet Nine {{is the result}} of their <b>resonant</b> dynamics. Objects in mean-motion resonances with a massive planet are phase protected, preventing them from making close approaches to the planet. When the orbit of a <b>resonant</b> object drifts out of phase,} causing it to make closer approaches to a massive planet, the changes in the perturbations the planet exerts on the object alters its semi-major axis in the direction that reverses the drift. This process repeats as the drift continues in the other direction causing the orbit to appear to rock back and forth, or librate, about a stable center when viewed in a rotating frame of reference. In the example at right, when the orbit of a plutino drifts backward it loses angular momentum when it makes closer approaches ahead of Neptune, causing its semi-major axis and period to shrink, reversing the drift.|$|E

25|$|Low cost {{ballasts}} mostly contain only {{a simple}} oscillator and series <b>resonant</b> LC circuit. When turned on, the oscillator starts, and <b>resonant</b> current excites the LC circuit. This <b>resonant</b> current directly drives a switching transistor through a ring core transformer. This principle {{is called the}} current <b>resonant</b> inverter circuit. After a short time the voltage across the lamp reaches about 1nbsp&kV and the lamp ignites. The process is too fast to preheat the cathodes, so the lamp instant-starts in cold cathode mode. The cathode filaments are still used for protection of the ballast from overheating if the lamp does not ignite. A few manufacturers use positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistors to disable instant starting and give some time to preheat the filaments.|$|E
25|$|In a dual <b>resonant</b> {{solid-state}} Tesla coil (DRSSTC), {{the electronic}} switching of the solid-state Tesla coil {{is combined with}} the <b>resonant</b> primary circuit of a spark-gap Tesla coil. The <b>resonant</b> primary circuit is formed by connecting a capacitor in series with the primary winding of the coil, so that the combination forms a series tank circuit with a <b>resonant</b> frequency near that of the secondary circuit. Because of the additional <b>resonant</b> circuit, one manual and one adaptive tuning adjustment are necessary. Also, an interrupter is usually used to reduce the duty cycle of the switching bridge, to improve peak power capabilities; similarly, IGBTs are more popular in this application than bipolar transistors or MOSFETs, due to their superior power handling characteristics. A current-limiting circuit is usually used to limit maximum primary tank current (which must be switched by the IGBT's) to a safe level. Performance of a DRSSTC can be comparable to a medium-power spark-gap Tesla coil, and efficiency (as measured by spark length versus input power) can be significantly greater than a spark-gap Tesla coil operating at the same input power.|$|E
