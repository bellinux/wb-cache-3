25|$|The {{previous}} {{version of}} the main look-up page of the OEIS offered three ways to look up sequences, and the right <b>radio</b> <b>button</b> had to be selected. There was an advanced look-up page, but its usefulness has been integrated into the main look-up page in a major redesign of the interface in January 2006.|$|E
25|$|HTML 4 {{introduced}} the label tag, which {{is intended to}} represent a caption in a user interface, and {{can be associated with}} a specific form control by specifying the id attribute of the control in the label tag's for attribute. This allows labels to stay with their elements when a window is resized and to allow more desktop-like functionality e.g. clicking a <b>radio</b> <b>button</b> or checkbox's label will activate the associated input element.|$|E
50|$|Radio buttons are {{arranged}} in groups {{of two or more}} and displayed on screen as, for example, a list of circular holes that can contain white space (for unselected) or a dot (for selected). Each <b>radio</b> <b>button</b> is normally accompanied by a label describing the choice that the <b>radio</b> <b>button</b> represents. The choices are mutually exclusive; when the user selects a <b>radio</b> <b>button,</b> any previously selected <b>radio</b> <b>button</b> in the same group becomes deselected (making it so only one can be selected). Selecting a <b>radio</b> <b>button</b> is done by clicking the mouse on the button, or the caption, or by using a keyboard shortcut.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>radio</b> <b>button</b> or {{option button}} is a {{graphical}} control element {{that allows the}} user to choose only one of a predefined set of mutually exclusive options.

The lower of the two boxes is dimmed, or disabled, indicating its widgets cannot be selected.

50|$|It is {{possible}} that initially none of the radio buttons in a group are selected. This unselected state cannot be restored by interacting with the <b>radio</b> <b>button</b> widget, {{though it may be}} possible through other user interface elements. When used in an HTML form, if no button in a group is checked, then no name-value pair is passed when the form is submitted. For example, for a <b>radio</b> <b>button</b> group named Sex with the options Male and Female, the variable Sex would not be passed, even with a blank value.|$|E
50|$|Often, {{a series}} of checkboxes are presented, each with a binary choice between two options. Then the user may select several of the choices. Compare this to a <b>radio</b> <b>button,</b> in which only a single option is {{selectable}} from several mutually-exclusive choices.|$|E
