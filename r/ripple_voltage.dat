Based on the classification, three operating modes can be defined, i. e., CISM, IISM as well as Continuous Conduction Mode (IISM-CCM) and IISM as well as Discontinuous Conduction Mode (IISM-DCM). The Output <b>Voltage</b> <b>Ripples</b> (OVR) in three modes are analyzed, respectively. It is pointed out that the converter in CISM has the smallest output <b>voltage</b> <b>ripple</b> independent of the inductance, while that in IISM-CCM and IISM-DCM has rather larger output <b>voltage</b> <b>ripple</b> that is increasing with the decrease of inductance. The maximum of output <b>voltage</b> <b>ripple</b> in various operating mode is obtained.

2500|$|A more usual {{alternative}} to additional filter components, if the DC load requires very low <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage,</b> {{is to follow}} the input filter with a voltage regulator. [...] A voltage regulator operates on a different principle than a filter, which is essentially a voltage divider that shunts voltage at the ripple frequency away from the load. [...] Rather, a regulator increases or decreases current supplied to the load {{in order to maintain}} a constant output voltage.|$|E
2500|$|For a given load, sizing of a {{smoothing}} capacitor is a tradeoff between reducing <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage</b> and increasing ripple current. The peak current is {{set by the}} rate of rise of the supply voltage on the rising edge of the incoming sine-wave, reduced by {{the resistance of the}} transformer windings. [...] High ripple currents increase I2R losses (in the form of heat) in the capacitor, rectifier and transformer windings, and may exceed the ampacity of the components or VA rating of the transformer. [...] Vacuum tube rectifiers specify the maximum capacitance of the input capacitor, and SS diode rectifiers also have current limitations. [...] Capacitors for this application need low ESR, or ripple current may overheat them. [...] To limit <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage</b> to a specified value the required capacitor size is proportional to the load current and inversely proportional to the supply frequency and the number of output peaks of the rectifier per input cycle. Full-wave rectified output requires a smaller capacitor because it is double the frequency of half-wave rectified output. [...] To reduce ripple to a satisfactory limit with just a single capacitor would often require a capacitor that's infeasibly large.|$|E

5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{scenario in}} AC to DC conversion is a rectifier without any smoothing circuitry at all. The <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage</b> is very large in this situation; the peak-to-peak <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage</b> {{is equal to}} the peak AC voltage. A more common arrangement is to allow the rectifier to work into a large smoothing capacitor which acts as a reservoir. After a peak in output voltage the capacitor (C) supplies the current to the load (R) and continues to do so until the capacitor voltage has fallen to the value of the now rising next half-cycle of rectified voltage. At that point the rectifiers turn on again and deliver current to the reservoir until peak voltage is again reached. If the time constant, CR, is large in comparison to the period of the AC waveform, then a reasonably accurate approximation can be made by assuming that the capacitor voltage falls linearly. A further useful assumption can be made if the ripple is small compared to the DC voltage. In this case the phase angle through which the rectifiers conduct will be small and it can be assumed that the capacitor is discharging all the way from one peak to the next with little loss of accuracy.With the above assumptions the peak-to-peak <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage</b> can be calculated as: ...|$|E

40|$|In today's {{electronics}} market, {{highly efficient}} DC-DC power converters are in great demand for battery-operated portable electronic devices. Voltage-mode switching power converter {{is widely used}} to provide a stable voltage to the portable devices as it has higher efficiency than the current-mode counterpart. Frequency compensation is critical in the controller design as it not only determines the loop gain but also the stability and the dynamic response of the converter. However, the conventional dominant-pole compensation technique only provides a small loop gain crossover frequency and thus results in slow dynamic response. In this thesis, a new frequency compensation scheme, which consists of a single-pole error amplifier and a high-pass notch filter in the compensator, is proposed. With the proposed compensation scheme, the loop gain crossover frequency can be significantly increased and thus the dynamic responses greatly improved. Two hardware prototypes of the buck converters with the conventional and the proposed schemes have been experimentally tested with different output <b>ripple</b> <b>voltages.</b> Measurement {{results show that the}} loop gain crossover frequency of the converter with the proposed scheme is 132 times larger than that with the conventional scheme.

In addition, converters with the proposed scheme under different output <b>ripple</b> <b>voltages</b> give the same loop gain crossover frequency as opposed to different loop gain crossover frequencies obtained from conventional scheme.

5000|$|The circuit {{works by}} {{alternately}} switching {{the output of}} each stage between a voltage doubler driven by [...] and one driven by [...] This behaviour leads to another advantage over the Dickson multiplier: reduced <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage</b> at double the frequency. The increase in ripple frequency is advantageous because {{it is easier to}} remove by filtering. Each stage (in an ideal circuit) raises the output voltage by the peak clock voltage. Assuming that this is the same level as the DC input voltage then an n stage multiplier will (ideally) output nVin. The chief cause of losses in the cross-coupled circuit is parasitic capacitance rather than switching threshold voltage. The losses occur because some of the energy has to go into charging up the parasitic capacitances on each cycle.|$|E
50|$|A more usual {{alternative}} to a filter, and essential if the DC load requires very low <b>ripple</b> <b>voltage,</b> is to follow the reservoir capacitor with an active voltage regulator circuit. The reservoir capacitor must {{be large enough to}} prevent the troughs of the ripple dropping below the minimum voltage required by the regulator to produce the required output voltage. The regulator serves both to significantly reduce the ripple and to deal with variations in supply and load characteristics. It would be possible to use a smaller reservoir capacitor (these can be large on high-current power supplies) and then apply some filtering as well as the regulator, {{but this is not a}} common strategy. The extreme of this approach is to dispense with the reservoir capacitor altogether and put the rectified waveform straight into a choke-input filter. The advantage of this circuit is that the current waveform is smoother and consequently the rectifier no longer has to deal with the current as a large current pulse, but instead the current delivery is spread over the entire cycle. The disadvantage, apart from extra size and weight, is that the voltage output is much lower - approximately the average of an AC half-cycle rather than the peak.|$|E
