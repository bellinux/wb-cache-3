50|$|In the Indian astronomical tradition, a Yuga is {{a period}} {{consisting}} of 1,577,917,500 civil days. Saturn makes 146,564 revolutions and Mars makes 229,6824 <b>revolutions</b> <b>in</b> a Yuga. So Saturn makes 146,564/1,577,917,500 = 36,641/394,479,375 <b>revolutions</b> <b>in</b> a day. By saying that the residue of the revolution of Saturn is x, what is meant is that the fractional number of revolutions is x/394,479,375. Similarly, Mars makes 229,6824/1,577,917,500 = 190,412/131,493,125 <b>revolutions</b> <b>in</b> a day. By saying that the residue of the revolution of Mars is y, what is meant is that the fractional number of revolutions is y/131,493,125.|$|R
