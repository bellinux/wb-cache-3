50|$|William Barons (also Barnes; died 1505) was the Bishop of London from 1504 to 1505. He {{was also}} Master <b>of</b> the <b>Rolls</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Chancery from 1502 to 1504.|$|R
5000|$|In 1875, the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Queen's Bench, {{considered}} a report detailing further malpractices with witnesses, fees {{and other matters}} by Levy and two co-conspirators. For example, in one case involving a compensation claim from a railway company, they recovered £600 in costs and damages, but paid out only half of this to their client. The report made clear that Levy was the main person behind these schemes and he was struck off the <b>Rolls</b> <b>of</b> <b>Court.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Clerk-Register {{was from}} ancient times the {{principal}} Clerk in the kingdom, from whom all other clerks, whatever their government positions, {{and who were}} essentially his deputies, derived their immediate authority. He acted also as Clerk to the parliament and Privy Council, where in the old registers and proceedings of parliament he {{is referred to as}} Clericus Rotulorum, because the ancient scripts were in <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> paper (as opposed to codices). These later became termed Rotuli parliamenti, the <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> <b>court,</b> but were thereafter ordered to be made up into Register books and the respective clerks instructed to transmit those books to the Clerk-Register to be preserved by him in the public archives.|$|R
5000|$|An {{example of}} a suit of Statute Merchant {{can be seen in}} the Plea <b>Rolls</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Common Pleas, in 1430, where John Salter, citizen & tanner of York, John Wyot, vicar of St Nicholas, Mikelgate, John Yoman, (the latter 2 as executors of Henry Ravenswath) are parties.|$|R
50|$|Named perhaps {{after the}} ancient Rolls House upon Chancery Lane where the <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Chancery of England were kept, or perhaps, like other parishes, the chapel. The {{site of the}} house and chapel became the nucleus of the Public Record Office, now the Maugham Library and Provost's Lodgings of King's College London.|$|R
5000|$|Listed as Badburgham in the Domesday Book of 1086, the village's {{name means}} [...] "homestead or village {{of a woman}} called Beaduburh".

5000|$|While John Fortescue {{wrote of}} ten Inns of Chancery, each one {{attached}} to an Inn <b>of</b> <b>Court</b> [...] "like Maids of Honour to a Princess", only nine were previously known. The {{existence of the}} tenth, Outer Temple, was first suggested by A. W. B.

At the time, Simpson debated whether it was a reference to a historical institution or simply a geographical address. In 2008 John Baker confirmed that it was most likely an institution with a discovery in the plea <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> King's Bench of a barrister who claimed to be a [...] "fellow of the Outer Temple". In 2013 John Baker discovered another member of the Outer Temple, Richard Palmer, who was sued in the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Common Pleas in 1523 and described as of the Exterior or Outer Temple, London.|$|R
50|$|The legal firm Rees R and Sydney Jones was {{established}} in 1864 by Rees Rutland Jones and is today the oldest existing legal practice in Queensland.

5000|$|Her husband Benjamin Benny {{was elected}} to the Australian Senate in 1919, resigning in January 1926 after {{suffering}} a stroke. He was immediately sued for misappropriating various trust funds, and in June 1926 was convicted of the fraudulent conversion of Treasury bonds to the value of £1,200 as well as various other trust funds. He was sentenced to three years' gaol, struck off the <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> the Supreme <b>Court,</b> <b>of</b> which he was a practitioner and declared insolvent. The Benny home [...] "Stoneywood", a 4.25 acre property overlooking the Seacliff foreshore reserve, was put up for sale in 1925.|$|R
5000|$|He was Recorder of Barnstaple in 1545, {{to which}} honorary officer the Borough of Barnstaple {{entrusted}} the nominations {{of its two}} Member of Parliament. One of the MP's he nominated was George Rolle (d.1552), a London lawyer, who in 1523 had been appointed by a private Act of Parliament as life tenant {{of the office of}} [...] "Keeper of the Writs and <b>Rolls</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Common Pleas", due to his [...] "long good and perfect knowledge and experience" [...] of the functioning <b>of</b> that <b>Court.</b> Rolle was thus an associate of Sir Hugh's father, Sir Lewis I Pollard, one of the Judges of the Common Pleas. It was in the small Devonshire parish of St Giles in the Wood, the ancestral home of the Pollards, where Rolle purchased his seat of Stevenstone, which eventually {{at the start of the}} 20th century became the caput of [...] "the largest estate Devon had ever seen", today managed by the Clinton Devon Estates company.|$|R

After the call ceremony, he/she can designate him/herself as a [...] "Barrister and Solicitor", and can practice law in the province in which they are licensed. In Ontario and other provinces, licensed lawyers may also exercise the powers of a Commissioner of Oaths. In the Province of British Columbia, licensed lawyers are automatically qualified to practice as a notary public subject to appointment. In Ontario and other provinces, a licensed lawyer must submit a form and pay a one-time fee to the provincial attorney general before he/she is appointed as a notary public.|$|R
5|$|Beckingham at {{the time}} he was {{mentioned}} in 1258 was working, probably as chief clerk, for Gilbert of Preston, the English crown's senior royal justice. This was an itinerant position, travelling in a circuit (or eyre); Gilbert's last eyre–and therefore also Beckingham's as his chief clerk–was that of 1268–72. In 1274, Beckingham himself was named an itinerant justice for Middlesex, although as yet this was not a permanent position and he was replaced by the next year. At this time he seems to have held the rank of king's serjeant. He received the commission of justice of assize in 1276. From 1273 to 1278, he was a senior clerk to the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Common Pleas, and was then made keeper of the writs and <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> the <b>court</b> (custos rotulorum et brevium de banco) until 1285. In that year, Beckingham was appointed a Justice of the Common Pleas.|$|R
5000|$|In 1633 he {{was called}} to the bar, and {{obtained}} quickly a good position and practice, [...] "you may have great joy of your son Ned" [...] his uncle the Attorney General assured his father. Both his marriages gained him influential friends, and in December 1634 he was made keeper of the writs and <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Common Pleas. His able conduct of the petition of the London merchants against Lord Treasurer Portland earned him the approval of Archbishop William Laud, with whom he developed a friendship; this was perhaps surprising {{on the face of}} it as Laud did not have a gift for making friends easily and his religious views were very different from Hyde's.Hyde in his History explained that he admired Laud for his integrity and decency, and excused his notorious rudeness and bad temper, partly because of Laud's humble origins, and partly because Hyde recognised the same weaknesses in himself.|$|R
50|$|He became Attorney General to the Duke of York (the future King James II of England), and Chief Justice (Seneschal) <b>of</b> the Palatine <b>court</b> <b>of</b> Tipperary. The latter {{office was}} {{generally}} {{seen as a}} sinecure, although {{the fact that there}} was normally a second justice (or Master <b>of</b> the <b>Rolls)</b> <b>of</b> the Palatine <b>Court</b> suggests that the workload was heavy enough. Meade was said to be a fine lawyer, but he seems to have had little interest in becoming a High Court judge, perhaps because his real interest was in politics. He sat in the Irish House of Commons, first for Trinity College Dublin in the Patriot Parliament of 1689, and then for Tipperary for the rest of his life.|$|R

50|$|Thomas Russell {{was born}} in County Cork, Ireland, {{probably}} in 1830. His parents were Thomas Flower Russell (c. 1808-1873) and Mary Roberts (c. 1811-1847). The family emigrated to Australia as steerage passengers in 1833, and settled in Maitland, New South Wales, where his father farmed. In 1840 the family moved on to New Zealand, living in Kororakea at first, then Auckland where his father worked as a builder. From 1844 Thomas Russell was articled to the lawyer Thomas Outhwaite and on 4 November 1851 was admitted as a solicitor on the <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> New Zealand. On 18 July 1854 he married Emeline Vercoe, third daughter of Henry Vercoe JP and niece of Walter Lawrie, the general superintendent of the Wesleyan church in New Zealand.|$|R

2500|$|Its {{early history}} {{relies on the}} records of a {{succession}} of Lords of the Manor, not {{all of whom were}} in permanent residence. The <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> the manor <b>court</b> have been missing since the 18thcentury, leaving the records incomplete. In the 12thcentury, 'Adam, son of Peter', an early Lord of the Manor, granted grazing and iron ore mining rights to the monks of Rievaulx Abbey. [...] Through the Middle Ages the Lords were the 'Earls of Ormande' (sic), possibly the Irish Earls of Ormond, followed by the Gascoigne family. In 1495, Rosamund Gascoigne, a daughter of one of the William Gascoignes who held the title, married Robert Rawson, thought {{to be related to the}} Rawson family of Bradford, after whom one of the city's markets is named. Their son, William, married a cousin, Agnes Gascoigne, and through the marriage the Rawson family inherited the manor in 1570.|$|R
