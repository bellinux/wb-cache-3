5|$|Ninety-seven British {{prisoners were}} killed and the Germans forced French civilians to bury the bodies in a shallow mass grave the next day.

5|$|The Duke of Greater Poland felt quite safe when he {{was invited}} to a meeting {{organized}} by Henry IV Probus. The meeting took place probably on 9 February 1281 in one of the Silesian villages; however, the Duke of Wrocław had another plan – he broke all the rules of hospitality, imprisoned the three princes who where invited (Przemysł II, Henry V the Fat of Legnica, and Henry III of Głogów), and forced them to make political concessions. This action was made even more outrageous by the fact that only four years earlier Przemysł II and Henry III <b>risked</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> and armies to save Henry IV Probus in the Battle of Stolec, which ended with victory of Henry V the Fat, the third guest of this meeting. Historians speculate that the reason for the Duke of Wrocław to make this radical move was probably his desire to increase his influence over the neighboring principalities as part of his own plans for a royal coronation.|$|E

25|$|Some Jewish {{historians have}} written of the {{negative}} attitudes of some Poles towards persecuted Jews during the Holocaust. While members of Catholic clergy <b>risked</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> to assist Jews, their efforts were sometimes made {{in the face of}} antisemitic attitudes from the church hierarchy. Anti-Jewish attitudes also existed in the London-based Polish Government in Exile, although on December 18, 1942 the President in exile Władysław Raczkiewicz wrote a dramatic letter to Pope Pius XII, begging him for a public defense of both murdered Poles and Jews. In spite of the introduction of death penalty extending to the entire families of rescuers, the number of Polish Righteous among the Nations testifies to the fact that Poles were willing to take risks in order to save Jews.|$|E

25|$|Just {{before the}} {{liquidation}} of the Ghetto {{in the course}} of the murderous Operation Reinhard in Kraków under Holocaust perpetrator Amon Göth, Maria Błeszyńska Bernstein escaped from there at night with her three-year-old daughter. They were rescued by Jerzy Zakulski. He engaged his whole family in the rescue mission including his father-in-law Jan Bahr, hiding Maria and her child in both households by turns. Eventually, they took them out of the city to a safer place of a cousin Zofia Strycharska in Myślenice. Both Maria and her daughter survived the war and returned to Kraków afterwards.

25|$|By 1790, the anticlerical Terror {{phase of}} the French Revolution forced many loyal priests {{to hide from the}} regime in order to carry out the sacraments in their parish.

Realizing that such priests <b>risked</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> day by day, Vianney began to look upon them as heroes. He received his First Communion catechism instructions in a private home by two nuns whose communities had been dissolved during the Revolution. He made his first communion at the age of 13. During the Mass, the windows were covered so that the light of the candles could not be seen from the outside. His practice of the Faith continued in secret, especially during his preparation for confirmation.|$|E
