25|$|A primary RFID {{security}} {{concern is}} the illicit tracking of <b>RFID</b> <b>tags.</b> Tags, which are world-readable, pose a risk to both personal location privacy and corporate/military security. Such concerns have been raised {{with respect to the}} United States Department of Defense's recent adoption of <b>RFID</b> <b>tags</b> for supply chain management. More generally, privacy organizations have expressed concerns in the context of ongoing efforts to embed electronic product code (EPC) <b>RFID</b> <b>tags</b> in consumer products. This is mostly as result of the fact that <b>RFID</b> <b>tags</b> can be read, and legitimate transactions with readers can be eavesdropped, from non-trivial distances. RFID used in access control, payment and eID (e-passport) systems operate at a shorter range than EPC RFID systems but are also vulnerable to skimming and eavesdropping, albeit at shorter distance.|$|E

Background One of the main objectives of the Auto-ID Lab Adelaide is the mastery of <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> chip design in up to date technologies. This research project of “passive <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> chip design ” deals with the challenges of low supply voltage, ultra low power consumption large input power dynamic range, weak back scattering, and effi-cient antenna matching. Among all the <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> chip circuit blocks...|$|R
50|$|Each pan is {{embedded}} with a <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> in {{the handle of}} cookware, which is covered by a special pan tag that protects the <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> from heat and moisture. A temperature sensor connected to the <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> is imbedded within a tunnel in the bottom center of the pan. The <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> monitors the food 16 times per second and transmits a proprietary signal to the |induction heater regarding the heating characteristics of the contents {{as well as the}} temperature of the contents to adjust the heat accordingly; the special pan tag is not battery powered and {{does not need to be}} recharged.|$|R

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that over 30 million library items worldwide now contain <b>RFID</b> <b>tags,</b> including some in the Vatican Library in Rome.|$|E
25|$|The unique {{identity}} is a mandatory requirement for <b>RFID</b> <b>tags,</b> despite special {{choice of the}} numbering scheme. RFID tag data capacity is large enough that each individual tag will have a unique code, while current bar codes are limited to a single type code for a particular product. The uniqueness of <b>RFID</b> <b>tags</b> means that a product may be tracked as it moves from location to location, finally ending up in the consumer's hands. This may help to combat theft {{and other forms of}} product loss. The tracing of products is an important feature that gets well supported with <b>RFID</b> <b>tags</b> containing a unique identity of the tag and also the serial number of the object. This may help companies cope with quality deficiencies and resulting recall campaigns, but also contributes to concern about tracking and profiling of consumers after the sale.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With {{continuous}} {{improvements in}} the efficiency of microelectronics, {{it is now possible}} to power a general-purpose microcontroller wirelessly at a reasonable range. Our implementation of RC 5 - 32 / 12 / 16 on the WISP UHF <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> shows that conventional cryptography is no longer beyond the reach of a general-purpose UHF tag. In this paper, (1) we provide preliminary experimental data on how much computation is available on a TI MSP 430 F 1232 microcontroller-based <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> containing approximately 8 KBytes of flash and 256 bytes of RAM, and (2) we show that symmetric cryptography is feasible on an RF-powered, general-purpose <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> — providing the first implementation of conventional cryptography on an RF-powered UHF <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> as far as we are aware. ...|$|R

The passive <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> embedded with a converter is described. A prototype <b>RFID</b> <b>tag</b> using a converter {{has been built}} with CMOS 0. 35 um technology.
