Foram utilizadas 1400 frangas de reposição da linhagem Lohmann LSL, empregando-se DIC em esquema fatorial 5 x 2 (níveis de cálcio e granulometrias do calcário), com 5 repetições com 28, 18 e 16 aves por parcela, respectivamente, nos períodos de 3 a 7, 8 a 12 e 13 a 16 semanas de idade. As dietas experimentais foram à base de milho e farelo de soja suplementadas com minerais, vitaminas e fitase (500 FTU/kg), sendo isoprotéicas, isocalóricas e isofosfóricas, tendo como fonte de fósforo o fosfato monoamônio e balanceadas de acordo com o Manual da linhagem Lohmann LSL (LOHMANN, 1999). Utilizou-se o calcário em granulometrias fina (DGM = 0, 135 mm) e grossa (DGM = 0, 899 mm) para atender os níveis de 0, 60; 0, 75; 0, 90; 1, 05 e 1, 20 % de cálcio total na dieta.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effect of protein level fed from 6 to 20 weeks of age on the performance of cage reared and floor reared <b>replacement</b> <b>pullets.</b> The protein level of rations containing 2800 to 3000 kcal. metabolizable energy per kilogram was varied by 2 % increments from 18 to 12 %, 18 to 12 % and 16 to 10 % during the periods from 6 to 10, 10 to 14 and 14 to 20 weeks of age, respectively. Data from these two experiments indicate that <b>replacement</b> <b>pullets</b> fed a 20 % protein ration to 6 weeks of age require a 14 - 14 - 12 or 16 - 12 - 12 percent protein level sequence from 6 to 10, 10 to 14 and 14 to 20 weeks of age, respectively, to maximize 20 -week weight and efficiency of feed utilization and minimize the days required to reach 50 % egg production. Feeding lower protein levels, i. e., 20 - 14 - 12 - 12, 20 - 12 - 12 - 12 and 20 - 14 - 12 - 10 percent protein level sequences resulted in inferior performance of <b>replacement</b> <b>pullets</b> to 20 weeks of age. The data also show that even though feeding a 20 - 14 - 12 - 12 or 20 - 12 - 12 - 12 percent protein level sequence resulted in a smaller bird at 20 weeks of age which required more days to reach 50 % egg production, the subsequent production during the following 42 -week laying cycle was not significantly reduced. The influence of protein level on the performance of <b>replacement</b> <b>pullets</b> was similar for cage reared and floor reared pullets even though pullets reared in cages were heavier at 20 weeks of age, consumed more feed, were less efficient in the utilization of feed and required fewer days to reach 50 % egg production compared to pullets reared on the floor...|$|R

Pullets reared at 29. 4 ° C. weighed less at 20 weeks of age, consumed less feed, were more efficient in the utilization of feed and required more days to reach 50 % egg production compared to birds reared at 18. 3 ° C. or under ambient temperature conditions. There was no difference in the performance of <b>replacement</b> <b>pullets</b> due to protein level sequence fed when they were reared at 18. 3 ° C. or under ambient temperature conditions, but birds reared at 29. 4 ° C. were heavier, more efficient in the utilization of feed and required fewer days to reach 50 % egg production when they were fed a 20 - 20. 8 - 18. 2 - 15. 6 percent protein level sequence compared to a 20 - 16 - 14 - 12 sequence. The data indicate that the protein requirement of birds reared at 29. 4 ° C. is greater than that for birds reared at 18. 3 ° C. or under ambient temperature conditions. The egg production and egg weight of birds reared at 29. 4 ° C. tended to be reduced compared to that of birds reared under ambient temperature conditions or 18. 3 ° C, but birds reared at 29. 4 ° C. consumed significantly less feed and required less feed/doze...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Replacement</b> <b>pullets</b> were {{reared in}} {{environmentally}} controlled chambers {{in which the}} lighting schedule was 14 L: 7 D, 14 L: 10 D or 14 L: 14 D. Both temperature and humidity were constant throughout the experiment. Neither body weight nor age at sexual maturity were altered by these lighting schedules. It was concluded that a unifying hypothesis to explain the various effects of photoperiods on growth and sexual maturity would probably not involve circadian rhythms. Poultry Science 56 : 1039 - 1040, 1977 In recent years, {{a large body of}} evidence has a c c u m u l a t e d which implicates circadian rhythms in the control of most physiological systems. In birds, circadian rhythms have been recognized in the mechanisms which control the timing of ovulation (Morris, 1973) and in the mechanism which controls the sensitivity of the gonads to photostimulation (Follett, 1973). Body temperature is also subject to circadian rhythmicity (Cain and Wilson, 1974). The plasma concentrations of corticosterone are also regulated by circadian rhythms (Boissin and Assenmacher, 1970) and such functions as energy metabolism and food intake are also influenced by circadian rhythms (Aschoff and Pohl, 1970). More recently, John and George (1972) have identified circadian rhythms in plasma concentrations of free fatty acids. In general, circadian rhythms will adapt to light-dark cycles which recur at 20 to 30 h. intervals. Beyond these limits, the rhythms usually revert to an endogenous rhythm which approximates 24 h. Biological growth can be viewed as the end product of intermediary metabolism. In view of the apparent ubiquitous occurrence of circadian rhythms in the substrates of and mechanisms controlling metabolism, it was hypothesized that growth should be regulated by circadian rhythms. In an attempt to demonstrate this hypothesis, <b>replacement</b> <b>pullets</b> were reared under light-dark cycles which recurred at 21, 24 and 28 h. intervals...|$|R
40|$|WITH {{the advent}} of {{off-season}} brood-ing and the rearing of <b>replacement</b> <b>pullets</b> and cockerels in confinement, the question of artificial light during the rear-ing period of chickens has become of major importance. The lighting during the hours of darkness of immature chickens being confinement reared is a common practice in New England, used mainly as insurance against piling and crowding. The experiments of Callenbach et al. (1944), in which June-hatched Single Comb White Leghorn pullets were used, indicated that a constant 24 -hour daily incandescent lighting program during the growing period inhibited the onset of sexual maturity and reduced the intensity of lay during the entire laying period. Much better results were obtained by these investigators, either by withholding the use of lights until {{the age at which}} sexual maturity would normally occur, or by providing a 4 -week unlighted period prior to the expected date of the onset of...|$|R

40|$|Soybean meal has {{provided}} {{the major source of}} protein in Oregon poultry feeds for the past 30 years. More than 60, 000 tons are used for this purpose each year in Oregon. Soybean meal obtained from the Midwest includes a freight cost of more than $ 40 per ton, an annual cost to poultrymen of about $ 2. 5 million. This additional freight cost has generated much interest in the use of locally grown soybeans in an effort to reduce the cost of poultry feeds. It has long been known that raw soybeans contain factors that affect the availability of nutrients to poultry or other monogastric animals. These factors may cause decreased fat and protein digestibility; decreased availability of the sulfur amino acids, methionine and cystine; reduced availability of some minerals; and interference with pancreatic enzymatic utilization.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Five {{separate}} {{trials were}} conducted to test the feeding value of Pacific Northwest grown soybeans for chickens and turkeys. Soybeans were obtained from farms near Walla Walla, Washington and incorporated into rations which were fed to <b>replacement</b> <b>pullets,</b> laying pullets, broiler chickens, turkey poults and market turkeys. These rations were either solvent soybean meal, extruded or raw soybean based and balanced isocalorically and isonitrogenously. Extruded and raw soybean rations fed laying pullets were supplemented with and without added methionine. Similarly, rations fed turkey poults were supplemented with and without added zinc bacitracin and procaine penicillin, and broiler rations with and without zinc bacitracin. In the first experiment, extruded soybeans {{were found to have}} essentially the same feeding value as solvent soybean meal for <b>replacement</b> <b>pullets.</b> The observed effects of feeding raw soybeans were delayed sexual maturity, reduced body weight, poor feed conversion, pancreatic hypertrophy and liver atrophy. In the second experiment, laying pullets which were fed either of three soybean rations in the grower phase, were again either fed or switched to solvent soybean meal, extruded or raw soybeans in the layer phase. Again, extruded soybeans were found to be equal in feeding value to solvent soybean meal in terms of supporting good egg production. The observed effects of feeding raw soybeans to laying pullets were poor egg production, poor feed conversion, decreased feed consumption, pancreatic hypertrophy, and liver atrophy. Pullets fed raw soybean in the grower phase produced significantly fewer (P <. 05) eggs in the layer phase even when they were fed solvent soybean meal. Birds fed raw soybean supplemented with methionine produced significantly more (P <. 05) eggs than birds fed raw soybean without supplemental methionine. In the remaining three experiments, the three soybean rations were fed to broiler chickens and growing turkeys. Extruded soybeans were found to be similar in feeding value to solvent soybean meal. Those birds fed extruded soybean and solvent soybean meal rations gained significantly more (P <. 05) and converted feed to body weight significantly better (P <. 05) than those fed raw soybean rations. With turkey poults, the supplementation of zinc bacitracin was found to significantly increase (P <. 05) body weights of birds fed extruded soybeans over those fed solvent soybean meal. With broilers, added zinc bacitracin and procaine penicillin did not prove to be beneficial. The observed effects of feeding raw soybeans were reduced body weight, poor feed conversion, wet litter and pancreatic hypertrophy in both species. Additionally, kidney hypertrophy was noted in broilers. Using up to 25 and 33 percent raw soybeans in broiler and market turkey rations, respectively, did not cause any significant growth depression.

40|$|Newcastle disease (ND), {{caused by}} Newcastle disease virus, is an acute, {{contagious}} and pathogenic infection of pet, free living and domestic birds. ND is an epidemic disease {{and it is}} responsible for high economic losses due to up to 100 % mortality. The control of ND in the intensive commercial poultry farms is largely dependent on prophylactic immunisation using conventional vaccines. The ND V 4 vaccine and its derivative ND V 4 -HR vaccine were selected originally for use in village chickens, due to their immunogenicity, thermostability, transmissibility and ease of administration. The efficacy of V 4 and V 4 HR vaccines have been established in many Asian and African countries {{in their ability to}} challenge a wide range of recognised and local velogenic NDV. Therefore, ND V 4 was tested for efficacy against B 1172 challenge NDV isolated in south Africa in 1993. Twenty-eight one day-old <b>replacement</b> <b>pullets</b> were vaccinated by eye-drop route at 21 and 49 days old. Chickens vaccinated by eye-drop route were left to mingle with the unvaccinated in-contact chickens. At 63 days all chickens including the unvaccinated control group were individually challenged with B 1172 NDV. Serological monitoring of NDV antibody response was done using HI and ELISA tests. The ND V 4 vaccine induced full protection against B 1172 NDV in chickens vaccinated by eye-drop vaccination and in 55 % of chickens vaccinated by the in-contact method. No association was seen between NDV antibody titer at pre-challenge and the ability to withstand B 1172 challenge NDV. A fair to good agreement was seen between the HI and ELISA test in monitoring NDV antibody response during the experiment. Although, the ELISA showed a higher sensitivity and specificity than the HI test, further studies are required using this method of comparison.

In trial 1, experimental treatments consisted of control, low toxin (1 ?g DON/g + 1 ?g AFB 1 /g), and high toxin (2 ?g DON/g + 2 ?g AFB 1 /g) diets. Pullets fed the high toxin diet had reduced (P< 0. 05) body weights compared to control and low toxin diets at d 14, 35, 49, 56, and 63. At d 21 and 28, there was a significant interaction observed between mycotoxin and DC inclusion in body weights. Following necropsies (d 35 and 65), relative liver weights and histopathological liver tissue damage were increased (P< 0. 05) in pullets fed high toxin diets when compared to control and low toxin diets. Relative kidney weights were increased (P< 0. 05) due to high toxin diet at d 65. Expected negative effects of toxin administration on titer development were not observed. The only interaction observed between mycotoxin administration and DC inclusion in trial 1 was on body weights. In trial 2, experimental treatments consisted of control, DON (9 ?g/g) challenge, AFB 1 (2 ?g/g) + FUM (54 ?g/g) challenge, and a mixed challenge (6 ?g DON/g, 1 ?g AFB 1 /g, and 27 ?g FUM/g).
