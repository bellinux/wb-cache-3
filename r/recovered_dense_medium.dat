40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that some long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) {{arise from the}} core collapse of massive stars, and thus {{it is inevitable that}} the environments of these GRBs are preburst stellar winds or dense media. We studied, for the first time, the wind model for afterglows based on the Blandford-McKee self-similar solution of a relativistic shock, and suggested that GRB 970616 is an interactor with a stellar wind. We also proposed a <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> model for some afterglows, e. g., the steepening in the light curve of the R-band afterglow of GRB 990123 may be caused by the adiabatic shock which has evolved from an ultrarelativistic phase to a nonrelativistic phase in a <b>dense</b> <b>medium.</b> We further discussed the <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> model in more details, and investigated the effects of synchrotron self absorption and energy injection. A shock in a <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> becomes nonrelativistic rapidly after a short relativistic phase. The afterglow from the shock at the nonrelativistic stage decays more rapidly than at the relativistic stage. Since some models for GRB energy sources predicted that a strongly magnetic millisecond pulsar may be born during GRB formation, we discussed the effect of such a pulsar on the evolution of the nonrelativistic shock through magnetic dipole radiation. We found that in the pulsar energy injection case, the <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> model fits very well all the observational data of GRB 980519. Recently, we combined the <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> model with the pulsar energy injection effect to provide a good fit to the optical afterglow data of GRB 000301 C. ...|$|R

40|$|GRB 980519 is {{characterized}} by its rapidly declining optical and X-ray afterglows. Explanations of this behavior include models invoking a <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> environment which makes the shock wave evolve quickly into the sub-relativistic phase, a jet-like outflow, and a wind-shaped circumburst medium environment. Recently, Frail et al. (1999 a) found that the latter two cases {{are consistent with the}} radio afterglow of this burst. Here, by considering the trans-relativistic shock hydrodynamics, we show that the <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> model can also account for the radio light curve quite well. The potential virtue of the <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> model for GRB 980519 is that it implies a smaller angular size of the afterglow, which is essential for interpreting the strong modulation of the radio light curve. Optical extinction due to the <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> is not important if the prompt optical-UV flash accompanying the Î³-ray emission can destroy dust by sublimation out to an appreciable distance.

The instrument readings and the model predictions are compared to demonstrate that the instrument readings are an analogue of the density of the medium.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> cyclones is often restricted by the solids-carrying {{capacity of}} the underflow, referred to as spigot capacity. Cyclone manufacturers normally recommend the spigot capacity for a cyclone of a particular size; however, {{it is not clear}} how these capacities are determined and whether they can be increased. In the literature, spigot capacity has previously been associated with roping flow at the underflow, although this notion has neither been clearly proven nor disproved. Furthermore, the effect of overloading the spigot on the operation of a <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> cyclone has not been adequately studied. In this study, test-work on a 165 mm diameter <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> cyclone was performed to investigate its spigot overloading behaviour. This work established clearly that spigot capacity was reached at the onset of roping flow, and that there was a critical underflow ore concentration at which roping/spigot overloading occurred. This ore concentration was shown to be a useful tool in anticipating and avoiding spigot overloading. Spigot capacities obtained in this study were higher than those specified in the DSM handbook, indicating that <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> cyclone could possibly be operated at higher spigot capacities.

40|$|<b>Dense</b> <b>medium</b> {{cyclones}} {{are used}} {{extensively in the}} mineral processing industry to beneficiate various minerals including coal, diamonds and iron ore, amongst others. According to Reeves (2002),. the cyclone has been installed in over one-quarter of the coal preparation plants worldwide [...] <b>Dense</b> <b>medium</b> cyclones {{have the ability to}} achieve high capacities, and simultaneously obtain sharp separations and high separation efficiencies. However, this piece of equipment does have a shortcoming in that its capacity is constrained by the solids carrying capacity of the spigot. This is termed the spigot capacity. There is uncertainty on whether the spigot capacities specified by DSM (Dutch State Mines), the original developers of the <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> cyclone, can be increased or not, and how these capacities were determined. The {{purpose of this study is}} to establish a methodology to determine the spigot capacities of <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> cyclones, and determine the parameters that influence these capacities. In order to illustrate the significance of increasing the capacity of <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> cyclones, the following coal example is used: In 2005, South Africa produced about 245 Mt of coal valued at R 35. 86 billion. A significant proportion of this coal is beneficiated through <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> cyclones. Therefore, an increase in the cyclone capacity, even if relatively small, represents a large number in terms of tonnages of coal produced or monetary gains. It has been established clearly in this investigation that the maximum spigot capacity is reached at the onset of roping. A critical sinks ore concentration at which spigot overloading occurs has been observed. The simplest and best indicator of possible spigot overloading has been established to be the sinks ore concentration, measurement of this parameter could, however, prove challenging on most industrial cyclones. Further, spigot overloading of a <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> cyclone can be detected visually by observing the discharge type at the sinks and monitoring particle misplacement to the floats stream. A regression model that quantifies the spigot capacity, in terms of ore and slurry, has been developed. Various parameters were considered in the model, these include: cyclone geometry, feed head, medium density, and medium grade. Parameters that influence the spigot capacity of <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> cyclones have been established, and their effect on the spigot capacity has been quantified. The spigot capacity values obtained in this investigation were compared with those specified by DSM, and it was concluded that there is large potential to increase the. spigot capacities. specified by DSM.

40|$|AbstractâThe {{subject of}} {{scattering}} of electromagnetic waves by dense media {{has been one}} of intense interest in recent years. The present paper describes polarimetric backscatter measurements made at uï¿½-band on layers of a <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> under very carefully controlled circumstances. The experiments have a dual purpose: 1) to evaluate {{the degree to which the}} experimental observations are predicted by theoretical, particle-based, random media models and 2) to test a proposed hybrid model by which the scattering and extinction properties of a <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> are characterized experimentally, allowing future modeling of the polarimetric response for any arbitrary configuration of the medium. The hybrid model assumes that first-order vector radiative transfer (RT) is a suitable theoretical structure, providing that the extinction and phase matrix components are appropriately specified; the specification is accomplished through an inversion algorithm involving polarimetric backscatter measurements. The major conclusions of the study are the following: 1) hybrid model is an adequate description of the <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> scattering behavior; 2) conventional RT appears to give a reasonable estimate of the observed radar response, but <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> RT gives a very low estimate; 3) phase function of the effective volume scattering element of the medium, obtained via the hybrid model, suggests a larger effective scatterer than the physical ones.

40|$|<b>Dense</b> <b>medium</b> {{processing}} is the beneficiation process {{most widely}} employed in South Africa. Based {{on the fact}} that South Africa (and its neighboring countries) is a water-scarce area, dry processing technologies are being evaluated for implementation in the region. In addition to not requiring water, the technique is less expensive than <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> processing- both in terms of capital cost and operating cost. An added benefit when preparing coal for use in power stations is the lower moisture content of the final product. The separation efficiency of dry processes is, however, not nearly as good as that of <b>dense</b> <b>medium</b> and, as a result, it is difficult to effectively beneficiate coals with a high near-dense content. The product yield obtained from some raw coals is lower than expected and control of product quality is not always easy with dry processes. In the case of easy-to-clean coals, dry processing gives good results and becomes a very attractive proposition â especially when the added benefit of low environmental impact is taken into consideration. The main consideration when implementing dry processing, especially for long-term projects, is whether the low cost of the process will be outweighed by the low recovery efficiency.

The integrodifferential equations are solved using an iterative method. Explicit expressions up to second-order solutions are given.
