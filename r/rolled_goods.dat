Two {{of the most common}} factory trimmed sizes of wallpaper are referred to as [...] "American" [...] and [...] "European" [...] <b>rolled</b> <b>goods.</b> American <b>rolled</b> <b>goods</b> are 27 inches by 27 ft in length. European <b>rolled</b> <b>goods</b> are 21.5 inches wide by 33 ft in length. Approx. 60 sq ft. Most wallpaper borders are sold by linear foot and {{with a wide range of}} widths therefore square footage is not applicable. Although some may require trimming.|$|E

Laminates, coated fabrics and films are primarily <b>rolled</b> <b>goods</b> (and occasionally sheets) of vinyl, polyurethane or paper. Superior durability, cleanability, stain and chip resistance, and design flexibility are hallmarks of these products. Additionally, the Engineered Surfaces Business Unit's products include viewnique digital wall murals {{which can be}} used to create branded interior for restaurants and retail chains.|$|E

Solutions can be diluted with water prior to application, and can coat most substrates or used to saturate them.

For example, this chemistry can be applied directly onto wires and cables, though it is especially optimized for use on components such as <b>rolled</b> <b>goods</b> or sheeted substrates.|$|E

40|$|Today’s {{automated}} {{production lines}} for parts of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics (CFRTP) are mostly designed for one special part or application. Changing part geometry or material {{would lead to}} a complete re-design of the whole process chain. Here comes the flexible and highly automated the DLR process into game: A continuously automated production line “from fabric delivery to the machined and quality inspected part – ready for shipment”. The paper and presentation focus on {{the first half of this}} process chain: “from fabric delivery to the tailored preform – ready for consolidation”. The utilized fabrics can be <b>rolled</b> <b>goods</b> like uni-directional (UD) tapes, non-crimp fabrics (NCF), wovens, fleeces and foils or even sheet goods like consolidated organo sheets. The <b>rolled</b> <b>goods</b> are automatically stored, fed and cut on the DLR’s cutting center (see picture 1). After cutting the cut-pieces are automatically picked and stored in a mobile drawer storage system, from where they are automatically supplied to a robot cell. A robotic pick and place process with a cut-piece detection camera, material friendly vacuum gripping and ultrasonic fixation units then detects, grips, stacks and fixates the cut-pieces to point-welded stacks ready for consolidation with e. g. thermoforming or vacuum consolidation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{methods to}} identify sources {{of variation in}} <b>rolled</b> <b>goods</b> manufacturing by defining the critical input process parameters, {{and the application of}} statistical process control. Sources of variation are prioritized according to a process control hierarchy, and reduced or eliminated through iterative cycles of rapid experimentation. This work emphasizes the value of team work, breaking down the organizational barriers between departments, knowledge sharing and the importance of a scientific approach to problem solving. FilterCo manufactures and assembles filter media catering to the ultrafiltration market growing at ~ 12 % over the next five years. In a high growth scenario, production yield variability presents on-time delivery complications while below target yields drive significant scrap value. As FilterCo seeks to improve product lead time for its customers, while reducing WIP inventory, it must seek to maximize OEE with respect to product yield, equipment performance and availability. The variation identification, reduction and process control methodologies presented in this thesis are demonstrated to advance the goal of reducing production yield variation. The impact of the work has been verified on three filter media grades and have shown ~ 40 % reduction in production yield variation, and rolled throughput yield improvements of ~ 30 %. These improvements on the three membrane grades alone have resulted in an annualized saving equivalent to 60 % of the total 2015 scrapped membrane value. by Jeremy Brian Rautenbach. Thesis: S.

Reggie Verghese became a music producer with EMI, then set up a sound studio, Boogie Productions. Lim Wee Guan and Jimmy Chan continued working {{in the music business}} as session and lounge musicians. Vernon Cornelius had a varied career that included becoming a Rediffusion DJ and frontman for The Overheads. Henry Chua headed an engineering company, and wrote Call It Shanty: The Story of The Quests, to date the only book written on the band. The band reunited for charity concerts in 1982 and 1989, and in 1994 re-recorded a CD of their hits. They also appeared on <b>Rolling</b> <b>Good</b> Times, a popular 1990s television programme.|$|R
50|$|Corona {{treatment}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as air plasma) is a surface modification technique that uses a low temperature corona discharge plasma to impart changes in the properties of a surface. The corona plasma is generated by the application of high voltage to an electrode that has a sharp tip. The plasma forms at the tip. A linear array of electrodes {{is often used to}} create a curtain of corona plasma. Materials such as plastics, cloth, or paper may be passed through the corona plasma curtain in order to change the surface energy of the material. All materials have an inherent surface energy. Surface treatment systems are available for virtually any surface format including dimensional objects, sheets and <b>roll</b> <b>goods</b> that are handled in a web format. Corona treatment is a widely used surface treatment method in the plastic film, extrusion, and converting industries.|$|R

50|$|Roll {{hardness}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parameters when deciding whether a paper <b>roll</b> is <b>good</b> or bad. A roll that is wound too softly can go out of round when handled. A roll that is wound too hard, on the other hand, can crack during transportation. These variations are difficult to detect. Above all, it is typically the variation in hardness across a given roll that relates most directly to such converting issues with soft edges being perhaps the biggest contributor.|$|R
