50|$|Originally, the <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> was {{classified}} as belonging to the genus Spizocorys. Formerly or presently, some authorities considered the <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> {{to belong to the}} genus Calandrella. Alternate names for the <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> include Cape Verde Islands lark, Raso Island lark, Raso short-toed lark and Razo skylark.|$|E

50|$|The female <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> lays one {{to three}} eggs per clutch, usually a day apart. The {{incubation}} time {{is thought to be}} 15 days. During incubation the female sits on the eggs for ten-minute intervals and then goes off to find food. The <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> population changes rapidly in response to rain, and has fallen to extremely low levels during droughts (Ratcliffe et al. 1999, Donald et al. 2003, Donald and Brooke 2006). The females, even though smaller in size, still provide by gathering bulbs while the males stay in the burrows and vigorously watch over the nest, protecting it from outside intruders. The <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> is not considered very fit for reproductive success and their reproductive success is very low. The adult sex ratio is unbalanced, with a high proportion of the population being male.|$|E
50|$|The island {{consists}} {{mostly of}} rocky desert with sandy {{parts in the}} west. (Ratcliffe et al. 1999) Most <b>Raso</b> <b>larks</b> are found on level plains with volcanic soil and are associated with small vegetated patches along dry stream beds in which it feeds and breeds (Ratcliffe et al. 1999). Suitable breeding grounds {{on the island of}} Raso cover {{less than half of the}} island. (IUCN, 2012) The barren island suffers from frequent droughts which create dry plains that force the <b>Raso</b> <b>larks</b> to move across the island in search for food. Their most common areas of habitation are near dry river beds, but due to the scarcity of water, only patches of vegetation remain for <b>Raso</b> <b>larks</b> to reside in. Their nesting and feeding grounds consist of those same areas where vegetation is available. The <b>Raso</b> <b>lark's</b> sensitivity to drought has kept it endangered for several years due to the dry climate on the Cape Verde islands.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> is {{threatened}} by predators such as the Cape Verde giant gecko and birds such as the lesser Cape Verde kestrel, brown-necked raven, and Cape Verde barn owl, which {{make it difficult for}} them to survive. Additionally, Raso larks are vulnerable to the threat of accidental introduction of cats, dogs, rats by fishermen or other visitors to the island. Within the habitat of the <b>Raso</b> <b>lark,</b> the Cape Verde giant geckos weigh roughly 100 g and include juvenile birds in their diet. The Cape Verde Giant Gecko eats most chicks and eggs before they are hatched and fledged. Many aspects of the species’ ecology and behaviour closely resemble that of the Eurasian skylark.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> is {{restricted}} in range to only Raso islet in the Cape Verde archipelago, although historically {{it is believed}} to have ranged over two other islands, Branco and São Vicente Island. All three of these islands were joined in the last Ice Age. Evidence from subfossil bone deposits reveal that the <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> once also existed on the islands of Santa Luzia, São Vicente, Santo Antão, and possibly Branco during the glacial times, before human colonization in the 15th century. (IUCN 2012) Unfortunately, colonization was followed by a rapid extinction of local fauna. Raso islet itself has no permanent water and has never been inhabited by people, a fact that has probably saved the lark from extinction until now.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> (Alauda razae) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} {{bird with}} a highly restricted range, being found only on Raso islet in the Cape Verde Islands. This critically endangered {{member of the family}} Alaudidae lives in very arid terrain, and {{is considered one of the}} least known birds in the Western Palaearctic region, due to its remoteness and the lack of much ornithological study on the archipelago as a whole.|$|E
5000|$|Alauda is a genus of larks found {{across much}} of Europe, Asia and in the {{mountains}} of north Africa, and one of the species (the <b>Raso</b> <b>lark)</b> endemic to the islet of Raso in the Cape Verde Islands. Further, at least two additional species are known from the fossil record. The current genus name is from Latin alauda, [...] "lark". Pliny the Elder thought the word was originally of Celtic origin.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} desert-dwelling larks have evolved long bills {{to aid in}} digging for food in the sandy {{environment}} but the enlarged bill of the <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> has evolved for dominance displays among males. Flocks have also been observed feeding among rocks close to the sea, and the birds excavate holes in sandy soil to extract the small bulbs of netsedges, which are perennial weeds in the sedge family that superficially resemble grasses.|$|E
50|$|Cape Verde's {{isolation}} {{has resulted}} in the islands having a number of endemic species, particularly bird and reptiles, many of which are endangered by human development. Endemic birds include Alexander's swift (Apus alexandri), Bourne's heron (Ardea purpurea bournei), the <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> (Alauda razae), the Cape Verde warbler (Acrocephalus brevipennis), and the Iago sparrow (Passer iagoensis). The islands are also an important breeding area for seabirds including the Cape Verde shearwater. Reptiles include the Cape Verde giant gecko (Tarentola gigas).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> feeds by {{digging in}} the ground for insect larvae, and bulbs of the nutsedge. Both sexes also feed on grass seeds, and insects such as butterflies, moths and grasshoppers. Food and water for the <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> is scarce during the drought seasons. These necessities are {{provided}} by eating Cyperus bulbosus or Cyperus cadamosti which are bulbs of nutsedges. Males and females have different sized bills, {{which is why it}} was thought that males fed more on bulbs than females do. To get to a bulb the <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> must use its beak to dig burrows in the sandy soil. New studies are showing that males consume more bulbs than females not because of the difference in bill size. Males bills are 20% larger than females bills (Donald 2007). Males consume more bulbs because males control the territories (Donald 2007). Females can dig the burrows just as well as the males. Males dig 0.32 bulbs per minute and females dig 0.36 bulbs per minute (Donald 2007). Males dig for 61.8 seconds while females dig for 58.0 seconds (Donald 2007). Females are just as adequate at digging as males, but they only spend about 1/3 as much time digging as males do. Because of this, females spend significantly more time feeding from the surface (Donald 2007). The males protect these territories, which usually have more than one burrow that provides them with food, even from the females of their species (Donald 2007). Females are dying at a much faster rate because of this and because their only source of food without the bulbs are insects and grass seeds. Females spend a larger portion of their time foraging which means less time looking out for predators and they also have a higher food stress which both can lead to their deaths (Donald 2007). During times of little food, the females are the ones to die from starvation because they have to find bulbs for the male and incubate the eggs.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} endemic bird species {{including}} the <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> {{along with more}} common swifts, larks, warblers, and sparrows. The islands are an important breeding site for seabirds including the Cape Verde shearwater and Fea's petrel (Pterodroma feae), which breeds only here and in Madeira. Santiago Island holds the only breeding site of the endemic and critically endangered Bourne's heron. The 11 endemic reptile species include a giant gecko (Tarentola gigas), {{and there are other}} geckos and skinks in abundance. The giant skink (Macroscincus coctei) is now thought to be extinct.|$|E
50|$|Raso is now {{the only}} home of the {{critically}} endangered <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> (about 45 pairs). The island {{has been identified as}} an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because, as well as the larks, it supports populations of Cape Verde shearwaters (with an estimated 2500-3750 breeding pairs), red-billed tropicbirds (25-40 pairs), Cape Verde (or Cape Verdean) owl and Iago sparrows, other includes Oceanodroma castro. It is one of only two islands where the possibly extinct Cape Verde giant skink has been recorded. The Cape Verde giant gecko (Tarentola gigas) and a skink (Mabuya stangeri) still occur.|$|E
5000|$|Raso larks are {{relatively}} small in size. The Raso larks can range from sizes between 14-18 cm. The adult population is mostly made up of males who are larger than the females. The body has black and brown short streaks and paler around the chest with an erectile crest. The bill is thick-based and robust, longer for the males. The <b>Raso</b> <b>lark</b> is considered an adult when it has developed a reddish-brown tone between the ears and tail, with a pattern on the crown and back. While in flight they display a short tail with short broad wings. The tail and edge of the wings are white.|$|E
50|$|Cape Verde {{has many}} species of endemic birds, which are {{observed}} by keen ornithologists and bird watchers on the islands. 130 migrant birds are reported to visit the islands, out of which over 40 nest there. The seabirds which breed on the island are: Fea's petrel (Pterodroma feae), frigatebird (Fregata magnificens) and red-billed tropicbird (Phaethon aethereus). Four species of birds, (Alexander's swift, the <b>Raso</b> <b>lark,</b> the Cape Verde swamp-warbler and the Iago sparrow) are also endemic here, while the Cape Verde shearwater is a breeding endemic. The endemic and endangered Bourne's heron is sometimes considered a full species. Also common are the greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus) and the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus).|$|E
40|$|Active {{conservation}} {{has often}} been successful in reversing or arresting population declines of endangered species. However, examples of Critically Endangered species recovering {{in the absence of}} human intervention are extremely rare. We censused the <b>Raso</b> <b>lark,</b> a single-island endemic of the Cape Verdes archipelago, annually from 2001 to 2010. Between 2004 and 2010, the world population grew from 65 to 470 individuals. This remarkable increase occurred without conservation intervention, but correlated strongly and positively with rainfall. Because of this population increase, the mean age of birds reduced and the population shifted from male skew, a consequence of higher male survival, towards one where the sexes were more equally represented. This study illustrates the dramatic effect that natural changes in climatic conditions may have on the recovery of endangered species. However, the current favourable situation may not persist, and we suggest a translocation to another Cape Verdean island be urgently considered. We conclude that temporal trends in the population dynamics of endangered populations need to be considered when planning and implementing species recovery plans...|$|E
