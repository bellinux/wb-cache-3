Some designs feature more than one sacrificial section which can stop the door from being opened from the attacked side (even with the key) while allowing the door to be opened from the other side. However these design offer limited protection. The British Standard cylinders that meet the TS007 3 standard can prevent this method of attack.

50|$|November 29, 2007: The {{existence}} of a pre-existing stress fracture in the engine <b>retaining</b> <b>bolt</b> (caused by mechanic error due to overtightening) {{and the lack of}} documentation showing compliance by the Nationwide AMO with the engine bolt inspection airworthiness directive for a period of more than 3 years prior to the accident led the South African Civil Aviation Authority to ground all Nationwide aircraft for non compliance with the applicable Civil Aviation regulations. The official CAA report further highlighted that the airline's service organisation was not in possession of a certificate to operate for a month prior to and {{at the time of the}} accident. Numerous points of compliance raised by safety inspectors had remained open despite repeated inspections and audits during a period of some years hence the lack of a certificate to operate for the Nationwide Air Maintenance organisation at the time of the accident to CE723.

5000|$|On May 18, Atlas 7D was {{prepared}} for a night launch of an RVX-2 reentry vehicle from LC-14, the second attempt to fly one after the launch of a C-series Atlas had miscarried two months earlier. The test was conducted with the Mercury astronauts in attendance in order to showcase the vehicle that would take them into orbit, but 64 seconds of flight ended in another explosion, prompting Gus Grissom to remark [...] "Are we really {{going to get on}} top of one of those things?". This failure was traced to improper separation of the right launcher hold-down pin, which damaged the B-2 nacelle structure and caused helium pressurization gas to escape during ascent. At 62 seconds into the launch, the pressure in the LOX tank exceeded the pressure in the RP-1 tank, which reversed the intermediate bulkhead. Two seconds later, the missile exploded. Film review confirmed that the hold-down pin on the right launcher arm failed to retract at liftoff and was jerked from the missile. The resultant force caused a four-inch gap in the B-2 nacelle structure which also damaged low pressure helium lines. The hold-down pin had not retracted due to a sheared <b>retaining</b> <b>bolt</b> in the bell crank pulley system in the right launcher arm. Once again, all other systems in the Atlas functioned well and there were no problems not directly attributable to the launcher malfunction. The flight of 7D resulted in improved maintenance procedures for the launcher equipment at CCAS and use of higher heat steel in the bell crank retaining bolts.|$|E
5000|$|The oxygen shelf {{carrying}} the oxygen tanks was originally {{installed in the}} Apollo 10 Service Module, but was removed to fix a potential electromagnetic interference problem.

The tank appeared to be undamaged, but a loosely fitting filling tube was apparently damaged, and photographs suggested that the close-out cap {{on the top of}} the tank may have hit the fuel cell shelf. The report of the Apollo 13 review board considers the probability of tank damage during this incident to be [...] "rather low."After the tank was filled for ground testing, it could not be emptied through the normal drain line. To avoid delaying the mission by replacing the tank, the heater was connected to 65-volt ground power to boil off the oxygen. Lovell signed off on this procedure. It should have taken a few days at the thermostatic opening temperature of 27 C. When the thermostat opened, the 65-volt supply fused its contacts closed and the heater remained powered. The board confirmed by testing that the thermostats welded themselves closed under the higher voltage.This raised the temperature of the heater to an estimated 540 C. A chart recorder on the heater current showed that the heater was not cycling on and off, as it should have been if the thermostat was functioning correctly, but no one noticed it at the time. Because the temperature sensor was not designed to read higher than the 27 C thermostat opening temperature, the monitoring equipment did not register the true temperature inside the tank. The gas boiled off in hours rather than days.|$|E

50|$|November 7, 2007: A Nationwide Airlines Boeing 737-200 {{lost its}} right engine {{a few seconds}} after liftoff from Cape Town International Airport en route to OR Tambo International Airport. The {{official}} CAA report found that the Nationwide Aircraft Maintenance, the airline's air maintenance organisation had failed to implement the mandated service directive to inspect the rear engine mounting on the 737-200 series aircraft every 700 cycles and that this omission hid {{the existence of a}} stress fracture in one of the engine retaining bolts which failed at rotation. This <b>retaining</b> <b>bolt</b> failure put sufficient strain on the engine pylon that it completely detached from the wing(to prevent wing damage) while the pilots performed an emergency one engine climb. The engine fell onto the runway, causing the airport to close and various other aircraft to be diverted to George Airport. During the accident, the aircraft also lost most of its 'A' system hydraulic fluid (and a substantial quantity of fuel from the right wing tank) via the now severed connections between the fuel and hydraulic system and the right engine. This kind of separation, and severance of the lines had been anticipated by Boeing engineers, but {{due to the nature of}} the separation, the break in the lines occurred deeper into the wing than the pre-planned breaking point. Amongst other failures, this also degraded the wheel brakes, and the nose wheel steering would not function. The undercarriage would also not extend normally and had to be lowered manually. Back at Cape Town, the detached engine remained to the east of the runway, and was only moved after an initial inspection by the accident investigators. Captain Trevor Arnold and First Officer Daniel Perry were in command of this flight, numbered CE723. Daniel Perry was the pilot flying at the time of the accident. No-one was injured.|$|E

40|$|Acceptance {{testing of}} the Turboprop Test Chamber was {{conducted}} during the weeks of 27 April and 4 May 1964. The tests were conducted by personnel from the Overhaul and Repair Department, Alameda Naval Air Station, from the Bureau of Naval Weapons Fleet Readiness Represent­ative, Pacific and from the USNPGS Department of Aeronautics. The power plant utilized for correlating purposes for a T- 56 -lOW turboprop engine, recently overhauled at NAS Alameda while the propeller was the Hamilton Standard model required for this engine. The test data reveal satisfactory correlation of the engine performance data with the Alameda test results. The discrepancies that do appear {{are the result of}} errors in the instrumentation system and do not present a major problem. All of the major facility systems function satisfactorily except the oil supply system and the chamber lighting fixtures. Engine starting and control systems were adequate although somewhat different from the designs utilized in the NAVWEPS specifica­tions for this engine. The engine support stand and thrust measuring assembly were found to be structurally sound and functioned satisfactorily. The propeller orifice assembly did not induce prohibitive vibrational stresses as was anticipated. However, the vibrational loads did cause the majority of the orifice <b>retaining</b> <b>bolts</b> to loosen during the test sequence. Three bolts were found beneath the test stand; these could have caused object damage to the engine. The major areas of discrepancy are the engine oil supply system and the test chamber lighting fixtures. The engine oil system as designed could not satisfy the requirements for the T- 56 series engine. It was necessary to re-route the oil by-pass system, to obtain a more precise control of the engine oil supply and pressure, and to provide a method to heat the oil for operation of the engine at high power set­tings. The system as temporarily modified, did function adequately during the test period. The lighting fixtures mounted on swivel joint bases oscillated vio­lently when operating the engine at Idle power. One fixture above the engine broke loose during this short period and was blown clear of the engine stand by the propeller air stream. All ceiling-mounted light fixtures were removed from the chamber before further engine operation. The acoustic survey revealed that the acoustic paneling in the in­ let and the exhaust passages functioned satisfactorily. However, the Sound Pressure Level reduction across the chamber front double-doors did not meet the specified limits. Corrective action is required to (1) provide adequate and safe lighting in the test chamber, (2) re-design and install an oil supply system compatible for operation with the T- 56 engine, and (3) provide positive locking devices on all bolted fixtures in the test chambers...|$|R

Laboratory test results show that the equation accurately predicts the amount of material retained and confirm the validity of the support concept. The examination of rib bolting at a coal mine experiencing rib sloughage provides evidence that the effectiveness of the support can be related to the failure pattern of the spalled material. An analysis of roof and roof support reaction to rib sloughage at the mine indicated that the rib sloughage had little effect on roof stability.

40|$|Prevailing {{torque nuts}} are an {{extremely}} popular method of providing resistance to vibration-induced self-loosening of fasteners. Such nuts have a self-contained prevailing torque feature {{that provides a}} degree of resistance to rotation. Although such nuts are frequently used, it is not widely realized that they can occasionally come completely detached from bolts. The mechanism by which this can occur has hitherto been unidentified since {{it has not been}} possible to replicate detachment under laboratory testing. This article identifies a general condition that can result in the complete loosening and detachment of prevailing torque type nuts. This mechanism involves the application of an axial load when transverse joint slip is occurring. This article describes a modified Junker test machine that allows the application of axial loading to a joint while experiencing transverse displacement. Tests have been completed using an intermittent as well as a constant axial load. Loading in both modes has been demonstrated to result in the complete detachment of this nut type. Based on this investigation, if the magnitude of the axial loading exceeds the residual preload in the <b>bolt</b> <b>retained</b> from sustaining transverse movement alone, the all-metal type of prevailing torque nut can completely detach.

2500|$|Numerous early {{improvements}} {{were aimed}} at increasing reliability and life, including a switch from the [...] "U" [...] shaped top (exhaust) well to a [...] "V" [...] shaped top well. This eliminated the cast top deck, which had {{been the source of}} some early-life failures, in favor of a top deck fabricated from plate steel."Much field difficulty was experienced, particularly in the weld of the stress plate to the cast steel top deck. This difficulty can be blamed on two things. First, we were attempting to weld to cast steel which in some cases contained burned-in sand. This made welding inadequate due to slag inclusions, etc. Second, we were attempting to automatically weld against a back-up strip which in some cases did not fuse properly, leaving a bad notch effect which, of course, increased stress beyond working limits and fatigue failures resulted. There were approximately 600 of these crankcases made, twelve of which were 16s. Only four of these twelve were placed in railroad service. They were retired after about three years of service. A retirement program is now in effect for all of these cast top deck crankcases. A new crankcase was developed and went into production in early 1940 using a fabricated top deck, and can be most readily identified by a change in the exhaust well of the engine, which lies between the V's from U shape to a V shape. This design simplified top deck machining, eliminated the studding of the cast top deck by replacing the studs with through <b>bolts</b> <b>retained</b> by crabs {{at the bottom of the}} pots and crabs at the top of the cylinder heads, using self-aligning spherical washers and nuts (See Figure 49)." [...] The 567 gave way to the 567A in 1941, which incorporated further top deck improvements and camshaft gear train changes."By 1941 it was desirable to further simplify the crankcase, and the flat top deck Model 567 A crankcase was developed. This crankcase was first used on the 12 cylinder LST engines which started in production early in 1942. The crankcase incorporated a flat tie plate the full length of the engine which provided a flat surface for mounting exhaust manifolds and lift hooks (See Figure 50)."It was at this time that the gear train was simplified from four to two idler gears as explained previously. The cast steel cylinder head retainers were simplified over the second 567 design." [...] The 567B followed in 1946 with minor improvements."In 1946 a new line of crankcases, designated as the 567B, were introduced which were basically the same as the 567A except for a change to permit the mounting of the auxiliary generator drive gear. About three or four months after the introduction of the [...] "B" [...] engine the cylinder head retainer castings, which had been a continuous source of production problems, were replaced with steel forgings." [...] The 567C was released to further improve reliability and manufacturability. Visually, the 567C may be distinguished from earlier models by the presence of round (instead of square) handholes."We are in the final stages of developing a new crankcase to be known as the Model 567C which will further improve our product. One premise of this design has been to eliminate water on any stressed member of the crankcase because of corrosion difficulties. In the earlier crankcases just described, cracks have occurred in the area of the cooling water which were caused by corrosion fatigue (See Fig. 52). [...] "The entire fabrication has been simplified through the use of heavy rolled sections to make up the main stress members. Complex forgings are used in the top deck in place of the many steel stampings, thereby reducing a tremendous amount of fitting and manual welding." ...|$|R
