50|$|Cooling is {{difficult}} with a junk head, with either air or water. Water ports must {{be connected to}} the <b>removable</b> <b>head</b> and there is little space available within the cylinder diameter. If the engine uses the common form of overhead poppet valves, these would also be difficult to fit inside the limited space. Air cooling is also difficult, as the shape of the head is deeply re-entrant and it {{is difficult}} to arrange airflow to the deep well around the spark plug or injector. Bristol developed a two-part head to address this problem, with copper conducting fins.|$|E

50|$|Anderson {{traveled}} to Minneapolis {{for a meeting}} set up by John Lind and William C. Edgar (1856-1932), editor of Northwestern Miller magazine. Anderson knew he needed investors if he was to turn his puffing process into a usable product. A group of twenty wealthy businessman offered support. They gave him a laboratory at Minneapolis Steel and Machinery Company to experiment with his ideas. Anderson took a four-by-thirty-six-inch gas pipe and sealed it with pipe heads on each end, one removable. He placed raw rice inside and rotated the cylinder while heating it. When a gauge showed what he felt was enough pressure, Anderson used a sledgehammer to knock loose the <b>removable</b> <b>head.</b> A shower of puffed rice burst from the device. The Minneapolis backers, though interested, sold their shares of the process to Quaker Oats Company. Quaker gave Anderson a Chicago laboratory but took little interest in his discoveries.|$|E

They were OHV, like their previous engines, as Buick had been using overhead valve engines since the Model B in 1904. The engine also had the starter and the alternator driven by one belt. The engine {{did not have a}} <b>removable</b> cylinder <b>head,</b> meaning Pistons had {{to come out of the}} bottom of the engine.

40|$|A {{sampling}} tool {{was required}} to evaluate residual activity ({mu}Curies per square foot) on the inner wall surfaces of underground nuclear waste storage tanks. The tool {{was required to}} collect a small sample from the 3 / 8 inch thick tank walls. This paper documents the design, testing, and deployment of the remotely operated sampling device. The sampler provides material from a known surface area to estimate the overall surface contamination in the tank prior to closure. The sampler consisted of a sampler and mast assembly mast assembly, control system, and the sampler, or end effector, which {{is defined as the}} operating component of a robotic arm. The mast assembly consisted of a vertical 30 feet long, 3 inch by 3 inch, vertical steel mast and a cantilevered arm hinged {{at the bottom of the}} mast and lowered by cable to align the attached sampler to the wall. The sampler and mast assembly were raised and lowered through an opening in the tank tops, called a riser. The sampler is constructed of a mounting plate, a drill, springs to provide a drive force to the drill, a <b>removable</b> sampler <b>head</b> to collect the sample, a vacuum pump to draw the sample from the drill to a filter, and controls to operate the system. Once the sampler was positioned near the wall, electromagnets attached it to the wall, and the control system was operated to turn on the drill and vacuum to remove and collect a sample from the wall. Samples were collected on filters in <b>removable</b> sampler <b>heads,</b> which were readily transported for further laboratory testing...|$|R

40|$|Imagine on {{the palm}} of your hand a small {{portable}} device for bio-chemical sensing. Now, someone tells you that the embedded detection apparatus exploits optical interferometry. Since you do not see any optical input/output, you guess that the whole optical system is well hidden somewhere inside, with light being internally generated by some optical source and sent to end-of-line photodetectors through suitable optical arrangements. If curiosity is so strong as to make you open the package, you would probably discover that in the optical system there are no components such as lenses, prisms and collimators. Quite reasonable indeed, because free-space bulk optics would hardly match the accuracy, reliability, size, and cost issues required by portable systems. What you would see instead is a small photonic chip, where every optical component is monolithically built on board. How far is current reality from this picture? Actually, the suitability of integrated optics for high-sensitivity multi-analyte label-free sensing does not sound like anything new today. Yet, as long as cost effective solutions are not available, its potential will remain substantially untapped. So far, chip re-usability and the need for inexpensive packaging tools are among the main issues that have hindered the full exploitation of photonic technologies in commercial point-of-need portable analytical devices. In particular, a constant matter of concern in integrated optics is how to couple light to optical waveguides in a way that is effective, reliable, and cost effective. Direct integration of optical sources onto the photonic chip would probably be the best solution to the problem. Unfortunately, conventional interferometric sensing schemes, based for instance on microring or Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), require the use of monochromatic laser sources, whose monolithic integration is still an open issue. If only we could use a broadband source, everything would become much easier [...] . This is indeed what K. Misiakos and co-workers have demonstrated in their work, where they realized the first silicon device hosting complete on chip interferometry for multianalyte label-free biosensing. The key element they developed is a photonically engineered MZI interferometer that can accommodate the light from a broadband light emitting diode (LED), yet providing the same functionality as a conventional MZI device employing a monochromatic light source. This behaviour is achieved by suitably optimizing the waveguide design of both (sensing and reference) arms of the MZI, in such a way that the relative phase difference between the light propagating through the two arms is almost wavelength independent within the 200 nm bandwidth of the LED. The broadband functionality of the MZI dramatically relaxes the complexity of the optical source integration, because a LED can be directly realized in silicon, for instance by biasing an avalanche p/n diode beyond its breakdown voltage. The full interferometric system includes ten LED sources, each coupled to a sensing cell (integrated MZIs), which share a single detector and provide a limit of detection of 10 − 5 refractive index units. Multianalyte detection is achieved by spotting the sensing arm of each MZI with appropriate probe molecules and by time-multiplexing the optical sources (that is, biasing one LED at a time) so that all the ten interferometers can be sequentially interrogated. Having everything integrated on a silicon chip carries also additional benefits in terms of cost, foundry service availability and ability to integrate mainstream readout electronics. The photonic chip is then equipped with a fluidic chamber and a <b>removable</b> electrical probe <b>head</b> assuring small size, chip re-usability and inexpensive packaging. After reading this work, we realize that bringing photonic technologies into portable analytical devices is today truly a viable option. It is not unrealistic to imagine that, in the near future, we will keep in our pocket optical sensing systems, enabling point-of-care biochemical analyses, rapid and inexpensive diagnostics, and at-home self monitoring. Probably smaller and cheaper than our smartphone, or even inside it [...] ...|$|R
