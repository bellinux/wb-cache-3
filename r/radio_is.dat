30|$|We {{provide a}} brief {{overview}} over the development of software-defined or reconfigurable radio systems. The need for software-defined <b>radios</b> <b>is</b> underlined {{and the most important}} notions used for such reconfigurable transceivers are thoroughly defined. The role of standards in <b>radio</b> development <b>is</b> emphasized and the usage of transmission mode parameters in the construction of software-defined <b>radios</b> <b>is</b> described. The software communications architecture is introduced as an example for a framework that allows an object-oriented development of software-defined <b>radios.</b> Cognitive <b>radios</b> <b>are</b> introduced as the next step in radio systems' evolution. The need for cognitive <b>radios</b> <b>is</b> exemplified by a comparison of present and advanced spectrum management strategies.|$|R

The Norwegian Public Safety <b>Radio</b> <b>is</b> scheduled for completion in 2015.|$|E
5000|$|The console <b>radio</b> <b>was</b> {{the center}} piece of {{household}} entertainment {{in the era}} of <b>radio.</b> They <b>were</b> big and expensive costing hundreds of dollars in the late 1930s. Tending to be a major-expense acquisition for a middle-class family, these <b>radios</b> <b>were</b> usually placed in living rooms. Most early console <b>radios</b> <b>were</b> tall and narrow, but as the years went on they got shorter and wider in accordance with the Art Deco design precepts which had gained trendiness.|$|R

5|$|After an {{audition}} process, Ned Luke, Shawn Fonteno and Steven Ogg {{were selected to}} portray Michael, Franklin and Trevor, respectively. Their performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology, but dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles was recorded in studios instead.

Additionally, a sabotaged ham <b>radio</b> <b>is</b> in one of the compartments which, when repaired, allows Antoinette to contact Poirot's nephew and ask him to research the passengers.|$|E
5|$|Qatar is {{required}} to have a broadcaster which has at least associate membership of the EBU {{in order to have}} a chance to take part, as Qatar <b>Radio</b> <b>is</b> only a radio station and Qatar lies outside the European Broadcasting Area and cannot apply for Council of Europe membership with Australia being the only exception after being an associate member for over 30 years. The broadcaster would most likely be Qatar Television (QTV) also owned and run by the Qatar General Broadcasting and Television Corporation (QGBTC). If Qatar Radio gets accepted too, then they would be able to air the contest alongside the television broadcast.|$|E
5|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>is</b> {{the debut}} studio album by American rapper LL Cool J.

The album also features a sound punctuated by DJ scratching, often brief samples, and emphasis of the downbeat. LL Cool J's aggressive b-boy lyrics explored themes of inner city culture, teenage promiscuity, and braggadocio raps.|$|E

Local <b>radio</b> <b>is</b> provided by Tower FM, which broadcasts across Bolton and Bury; Bolton FM began broadcasting in 2009.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving <b>radio</b> <b>is</b> unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E
50|$|In 1926, Philco {{decided to}} begin making radios.

5|$|The team {{tries to}} call for further assistance, but find the <b>radio</b> <b>is</b> no longer working. Randall heads outside to check the power transformers, and is {{attacked}} by a large creature (Ross Sturlin) hiding in the underbrush around the station. Randall fires a few shots at the creature with his pistol and escapes unscathed. Although {{he did not get}} a good look at the creature, he describes it to the rest of the team as similar in size to a bear. Later, the team finds the infirmary has been trashed and Corcoran's body is gone. They initially believe the creature has broken in and stole the corpse, but are shocked to instead find Corcoran has mysteriously regained consciousness. Upon checking his blood again, there is no trace of the mysterious cells from before, but after investigating Corcoran's body, they find the cells have changed into lizard-like fetuses and entered into his abdominal cavity. The creature later breaks into the lab again, this time beheading Dr. Wyman. Randall and Dunlap are initially suspicious that Corcoran was involved in the death, which he denies, but it appears he has some sort of telepathic connection with the creature. Despite Wyman's death, Corcoran does not believe the creature is evil, but rather simply misunderstood. He implores the others to give the creature a chance to explain its actions, and asks that they not condemn it as a monster simply because it is different.|$|E

50|$|In the 1930s some <b>radios</b> <b>were</b> {{manufactured}} using Catalin, {{which is}} the phenolic resin component of bakelite, with no organic filler added, but nearly all historic bakelite <b>radios</b> <b>are</b> the standard black-brown bakelite color. Bakelite as used for <b>radio</b> cabinets <b>was</b> traditionally brown, and this color came from the ground walnut shell flour added to the thermosetting phenolic resin as an extender and strengthening agent.|$|R
