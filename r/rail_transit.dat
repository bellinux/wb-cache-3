5|$|Near {{the end of}} 1982, Ontario Minister of Transportation and Communications James W. Snow {{announced}} the launching of GO-ALRT (Advanced Light <b>Rail</b> <b>Transit),</b> an interregional light <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> program providing $2.6 billion (1980 dollars) of infrastructure. Although this plan {{did not come to}} fruition, certain key objectives from it were established in other ways: additional stations were built, all-day service to Whitby and Burlington was established and networks of buses and trains interconnected the network.|$|E

5|$|The Mass Rapid Transit, or MRT, is a {{rapid transit}} system forming the major {{component}} of the railway system in Singapore, spanning the entire city-state. The earliest section of the MRT, between Toa Payoh and Yio Chu Kang, opened on 7 November 1987, making it the second-oldest metro system in Southeast Asia, after Philippine's Manila Light <b>Rail</b> <b>Transit</b> System Line 1 that was established in 1984. The network has since grown rapidly in accordance with Singapore's aim of developing a comprehensive rail network as {{the backbone of the}} public transport system in Singapore, with an average daily ridership of 3.031 million in 2015 (including the Light <b>Rail</b> <b>Transit</b> (LRT)), approximately 78% of the bus network's 3.891 million in the same period.|$|E
5|$|Caltrain is a {{commuter}} <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> system {{that serves the}} San Francisco Peninsula and the Santa Clara Valley in the U.S. state of California. It is operated under contract by TransitAmerica Services and funded jointly by the City and County of San Francisco, San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans), and Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) through the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board (PCJPB). The system's average weekday ridership is 62,190 as of February 2017.|$|E
5|$|DOTC Undersecretary for Public Information Dante Velasco has {{unveiled}} a study {{being conducted by}} the DOTC looking {{at the possibility of}} transferring operations of Line 3 (MRT 3) from Metro <b>Rail</b> <b>Transit</b> Corporation (MRTC) to LRTA thus uniting Lines 1, 2, and 3 under one operator to improve maintenance costs and to form a more integrated transportation system. According to DOTC Undersecretary For Rails Glicerio Sicat, the transfer is set by the government in June 2011.|$|E

5|$|The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey manages and {{maintains}} infrastructure {{critical to the}} New York/New Jersey region’s trade and transportation network—five of the region’s airports, the New York/New Jersey seaport, the PATH <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> system, six tunnels and bridges between New York and New Jersey, the Port Authority Bus Terminal and George Washington Bridge Bus Station in Manhattan and The World Trade Center site.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s {{plans were}} laid {{for a massive}} freeway system in Washington. Harland Bartholomew, who chaired the National Capital Planning Commission, thought that a <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> system would never be {{self-sufficient}} because of low density land uses and general transit ridership decline. But the plan met fierce opposition, and was altered to include a Capital Beltway system plus rail line radials. The Beltway received full funding; funding for the ambitious Inner Loop Freeway system was partially reallocated toward construction of the Metro system.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Toronto City Council again {{proposed}} {{to extend the}} line northeastward {{as a replacement for}} the aging Scarborough RT. In 2006, this proposal was then altered when Scarborough councillors agreed to support plans to refurbish the existing line using other light-metro options for Scarborough. Using heavy-rail rapid transit {{like the rest of the}} Toronto subway in Scarborough was not yet examined. In 2007, mayor David Miller included the refurbishment of the Scarborough RT using modern light <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> as part of his Transit City plan.|$|E

5|$|Prior to NYC Ferry, {{there had}} been many ferries that traversed the East River and Hudson River, {{although}} by the 1960s, almost all ferry services citywide had been discontinued due to the popularity of road and <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> across the rivers. Ferries in New York City saw a revival in the 1980s and 1990s. As a result of two studies in 2011 and 2013 that showed the impacts of these recent ferries, the city officially proposed its own ferry service in 2013, separate from existing New York City ferry systems such as NY Waterway, New York Water Taxi, and the Staten Island Ferry.|$|E
5|$|Sound Transit {{plans to}} run a bus rapid transit line on SR522 from NE 145th Street to the University of Washington Bothell campus {{as part of its}} Sound Transit 3 program, {{approved}} in 2016. The line is scheduled to begin service in 2024 and will terminate at the NE 145th Street light rail station in Shoreline. The corridor has also been proposed for forms of <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> since the mid-20th century, including the failed Forward Thrust ballot measures of 1968 and 1970, the Seattle Monorail Project, and light rail in the Sound Transit long-range plan.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{serviced}} by the LRT Line 1 and Line 2, which form the Manila Light <b>Rail</b> <b>Transit</b> System. Development of the railway system {{began in the}} 1970s under the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, when Line 1 was built, making it the first light rail transport in Southeast Asia. These systems are currently undergoing a multibillion-dollar expansion. Line 1 runs {{along the length of}} Taft Avenue (N170/R-2) and Rizal Avenue (N150/R-9), and Line 2 runs along Claro M. Recto Avenue (N145/C-1) and Ramon Magsaysay Boulevard (N180/R-6) from Santa Cruz, through Quezon City, up to Masinag in Antipolo, Rizal.|$|E

5|$|The {{planning}} {{of the metro}} was spurred {{by the development of}} the Ørestad area of Copenhagen. The principle of building a <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> was passed by the Parliament of Denmark on 24 June 1992, with the Ørestad Act. The responsibility for developing the area, as well as building and operating the metro, was given to the Ørestad Development Corporation, a joint venture between Copenhagen Municipality (45%) and the Ministry of Finance (55%). Initially, three modes were considered: a tramway, a light rail and a rapid transit. In October 1994, the Development Corporation chose a light rapid transit.|$|E
5|$|Mini Metro is {{a puzzle}} {{strategy}} video game developed by indie development team Dinosaur Polo Club. Players are tasked with constructing an efficient <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> network for {{a rapidly growing}} city. Stations are represented by differently shaped nodes and players can build tracks to connect them by drawing lines. Levels are based on real cities {{and the appearance of}} stations and passengers is procedurally generated. The game's visual style makes use of bold colours and simple geometry to replicate the appearance of modern transit maps. The game uses a procedural audio system to generate sounds based on the player actions and transit network. The rhythms and sounds created took inspiration from works of minimal music.|$|E
5|$|Plans for <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> {{have existed}} since the 1970s, {{following}} the 1965 {{closing of the}} Bergen Tramway. A rapid transit design was first discarded, and in the 1990s a light rail line was proposed. The decision to start construction was made in 2005. The first stage was built by the municipality, with financing {{from the state and}} the toll road ring, based on the Bergen Program. Ownership, maintenance and further extensions and vehicles are the responsibility of Hordaland County Municipality through its wholly owned subsidiary Bybanen AS. Operation is governed by public service obligation contracts issued by the county public transport authority Skyss. From 2010 to 2017 the line and its 20 Variotrams will be operated by Keolis Norge (formerly Fjord1 Partner).|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after the ultimatum, both Lithuania and Poland named their ambassadors. Kazys Škirpa was sent to Warsaw, and Franciszek Charwat was sent to Kaunas before March 31, the {{deadline}} indicated in the ultimatum. Negotiations over practical matters began on March 25, in Augustów, and by June three agreements covering <b>rail</b> <b>transit,</b> mail service, and river navigation had been concluded. The railroad, torn apart for several kilometers at the border, was repaired. A customs post was established in Vievis, and consulates were opened in Klaipėda and Vilnius. Lithuania closed the League for the Liberation of Vilnius and the Vilnius Foundation; the latter organization had given financial support to Lithuanian activities in the Vilnius Region. Nevertheless, Lithuania continued to claim Vilnius as its de jure capital. In May 1938 a new constitution was adopted, which echoed the previous constitution's statement that Vilnius was the permanent capital of Lithuania and that Kaunas was merely a temporary capital. Poland continued to suppress Lithuanian organizations in Vilnius.|$|E
5|$|Before Imbudo struck, {{officials}} evacuated over 14,000people to {{at least}} 60shelters. Government offices were closed along the typhoon's path, and schools were closed in the capital, Manila. PAGASA issued a number 4 warning signal, the highest level, for three northern provinces, indicating the imminent threat of a powerful storm. Despite the warning, a post-storm survey in Isabela province indicated that 34% were unaware of the storm's arrival, while others believed the typhoon {{would not be as}} strong. In Manila, four flights were canceled at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, and the Manila Light <b>Rail</b> <b>Transit</b> System was shut down for two hours. Travel by ship and bus were halted in some areas. On July22 before the storm struck, the Philippine military was put on red alert, increasing security at the presidential palace. The military stated it was due to the typhoon, although newspapers suggested it was to prevent a coup attempt; a failed coup ultimately did occur on July27 in what would become known as the Oakwood mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Mini Metro is puzzle {{strategy}} video game, {{in which}} players are tasked with building an efficient <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> network for {{a rapidly growing}} city. Each level is a flat depiction of a real city and begins with three train stations. Train stations are represented by different shaped nodes. Players can construct routes to link stations by drawing lines between them; each route has a different colour. Passengers appear at stations, each denoted by a shape that identifies which station they want to travel to. Trains travel along routes taking passengers to their desired stations. Rivers, intersecting train lines {{and the appearance of}} more stations and passengers over time causes the transit network to become more complex and difficult to manage. Common-shaped stations can also change their node shape into rarer ones. The game's visual style is minimalist, employing straight lines and bold colours, similar to modern transit maps.|$|E
