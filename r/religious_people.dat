5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted {{as representative of}} religion and <b>religious</b> <b>people,</b> as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, necessary for {{a better understanding of}} theism. Marxists and anarchists also felt that their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters were meant to be realistic, and that few people have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E
5|$|Peter Donovan criticises the language-games {{approach}} {{for failing to}} recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many <b>religious</b> <b>people</b> make claims to truth. He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to be meaningful and true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such a comparison between beliefs is impossible. Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the apologetics of some, demonstrates that they {{interact with each other}} and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.|$|E
5|$|Castro's {{government}} diversified {{its economy}} into biotechnology and tourism, the latter outstripping Cuba's sugar industry as its {{primary source of}} revenue in 1995. The arrival of thousands of Mexican and Spanish tourists led to increasing numbers of Cubans turning to prostitution; officially illegal, Castro refrained from cracking down on prostitution in Cuba, fearing a political backlash. Economic hardship led many Cubans toward religion, both {{in the form of}} Roman Catholicism and Santería. Although long thinking religious belief to be backward, Castro softened his approach to religious institutions and <b>religious</b> <b>people</b> were permitted {{for the first time to}} join the Communist Party. Although he viewed the Roman Catholic Church as a reactionary, pro-capitalist institution, Castro organized a visit to Cuba by Pope John Paul II for January 1998; it strengthened the position of both the Cuban Church and Castro's government.|$|E

25|$|Bakunin {{argues that}} oppressors receive {{authority}} from religion. <b>Religious</b> <b>people</b> {{are in many}} cases obedient to the priests, because many <b>religious</b> <b>people</b> believe that the statements of priests are based on direct divine revelation or scripture. The obedience to divine revelation or scripture is considered as the ethical criteria by many <b>religious</b> <b>people,</b> because God is considered as the omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being. Therefore, each statement which is considered derived from an infallible God cannot be criticized by humans. According to this religious way of thinking, humans cannot know by themselves what is just, but that only God decides what is good or wrong. People who disobey the “messengers of God” are threatened with punishment in hell.|$|E
