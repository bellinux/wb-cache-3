This paper focuses mainly on the economics of photovoltaic energy, specifically valuation of this technology. First, photovoltaic power systems are described, followed by {{a description of the}} method of analysis of photovoltaic project efficiency used in the case study. The main part is devoted to a specific case study of a power plant photovoltaic project valuation (using the Net Present Value). The authors have tried to answer the questions of guaranteed <b>redemption</b> <b>prices</b> as well as the "green bonus". A sensitivity analysis of the NPV to changes in some input parameters is calculated in the discussion.

60|$|I {{have other}} remarks to offer. I write, however, from memory. Three {{millions}} of the £8,000,000 were paid in exchequer bills. The difference between £100 {{and the price}} of consols at the time may, in argument at least, fairly be considered as public loss. You say it was 90 or 91. We could not, however, if the operation had not taken place, have applied our surplus revenue with advantage to the reduction of debt. The balances would have been richer by £5,000,000, but we had to raise seven millions for the services of the year 1854-5. Now, as I am making myself liable for the loss of half a million of money in repaying the South Sea Company, and thereby starving the balances, I am entitled to say on the other hand that the real loss is to be measured by the amount of necessity created for replenishing them, and the charge entailed in effecting it. This I think was done by the exchequer bonds: and beyond all doubt a large saving was effected to the public by raising money upon those bonds, instead of borrowing in consols at 84 or thereabouts, which I think would have been the price for which we should in that year have borrowed--say, at 84. The <b>redemption</b> <b>price,</b> i.e. the price at which on the average consols have been in recent times redeemed, can hardly I think be less than 95, and may be higher. There was in 1854 a strong combination in the City to compel a 'loan' by bearing the funds; and when it was defeated by the vote of the House of Commons, a rapid reaction took place, several millions, as I understand, were lost by the 'bear,' and the attempt was not renewed in 1855, when the loan was, I believe, made on fair terms, relatively to the state of the market.|$|E

60|$|Ninth.

'Let Israel hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.' Mercy and redemption, mercy through a Redeemer, therefore 'let Israel hope'! It must also be noted, that this word redemption is, as it were, the explicatory part of the text, for the helping of Israel to hope. As who should say, as there is with God mercy, so there is with him a way to his mercy, and that way is <b>redemption,</b> or a <b>price</b> paid for your sins; and that you should not be discouraged through the greatness of your sins, I tell you there is with God plenty of this <b>redemption,</b> or a <b>price</b> paid to the full; to an over and above.

The results are of interest to managers planning a promotion calendar and deciding whether to coordinate price promotions with coupon events, and they contribute to economic theory.

40|$|The {{agriculture}} is regulated generally by majority of developed countries. This statement {{is particularly true}} when taking European Union into account. This regulation, which comes often together with high grants, is explained by seasonal character of agriculture, supporting of rural country, protection of jobs but also by existence of foreign grants and financial support. The original idea behind Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was to increase the income of agriculture segment. That is why EU started to subsidize the agricultural products. This led to increase of production because of the fact, that the farmers made use of the subsidies and produced higher quantities. The farmers enlarged the crops areas, used intensive methods of production, extended usage of heavy machinery and invested more in processing. This resulted in increase of secondary processing business sector. This brought the basic economic problem for the farmers: higher production backed by higher subsidies resulted in overlap of supply over demand on the market, which subsequently forced decrease in price of goods. This way, the income of farmers decreased {{back to the original}} level. The Government reacted to this process by setting minimal <b>redemption</b> <b>prices.</b> Higher price would subsequently decrease number of sold agriculture commodities. This way, there occurs overproduction, which is logical consequence of regulating the system by minimal <b>redemption</b> <b>prices.</b> There exist several possibilities how to react to such a situation. Export subventions (financial support for exports and granting of export licences) mean only transferring the problem of overproduction to another country. Another "possibility" is to cut-down imported quantities by putting restriction on import, such as quantity restrictions or customs duties. The support of export makes the situation more difficult for local farmers and import restrictions could lead to retaliatory action. The last used method is a possibility of buying out of the overflowing quantity of agricultural products and its either destruction or selling these under price. In EU discussions about complex reform of CAP and the way of its financing are constantly in progress. Quality of products and support of rural country are the priorities of this complex reform. According to Author, the regulation of agricultural industry is necessary in European context, but in another way that is performed under CAP. The regulation is not necessary just because of the fact, that {{agriculture is}} a specific sphere of business, but more likely because of the need to control cheap, low-quality and dangerous products, as well as maintaining reasonable balance of migration of people from rural country towards towns. The approach of EU to market intervention is shown by the Author specifically on the market of agricultural commodities in EU and CR. According {{to the fact that the}} legislation relating to this topic is very wide, the Author used specific example of the butter market and examined the interventions on this market in detail. Market prices of butter and intervention purchases in EU countries were cross-examined. For this comparison the price levels from years 2005, 2006 and 2007 were used for the EU countries using intervention tool on the butter market. As a result of this analysis the Author declares, that he did not notice any significant differences in level of intervention prices among the EU countries. This applies to new EU joining countries as well. In the Czech Republic the State Agricultural Intervention Fund (SZIF) intervenes on the agricultural market. This Fund buys agricultural overpluses and tries to sell these commodities at highest price possible. Loss from intervention operations is estimated to be several billion Czech crowns per year. In 2005 SZIF accepted 26 offers from three economic operators and bought altogether 795, 1 tons of butter. This number refers to the quantity after deduction of returned butter. The value of butter kept by the SZIF was 69, 335, 000 CZK including VAT. In 2006, as in 2005, buy-outs of butter were initialised by Commission as late as at the beginning of April. Again, this was caused by the fact, that the market price was by 7 % higher, in comparison to new intervention price. Between 3 rd April and 15 th June the SZIF accepted 31 offers from four economic operators and bought altogether 1, 164. 2 tons of butter. Total value of butter was 157, 475, 000 CZK including VAT (69, 335, 000 CZK from year 2005 and 88, 140, 000 CZK relating to 2006). In 2007 and 2008 almost no butter was purchased because of the high global market price. An important conclusion can be made in relation to result of intervention tools and its impact on consumers, producing subjects and milk processing companies. Situation on the Common EU market is dependent on successful handling of agricultural overpluses, which means dependency on global prices of milk commodities and actual foreign exchange rates (USD/EUR/CZK). And what is a most important; main beneficiary from intervention purchases is the processing industry, to which this support is not primarily addressed. Intervention purchases have nearly no impact on income of commodity first-producers as well as on the consumer prices. Liberalisation of the world trade is another area analysed in this Thesis. Liberalisation does not have to mean necessarily reduction of agricultural production, especially not in territories favourable for agriculture. It is probable, that together with increasing financial solvency of poor countries, demand for agricultural product, backed by ability to pay, will grow in these regions. These countries will not be able to satisfy this demand themselves also because of the fact, that high quantities of local agricultural production is exported. As a result, liberalisation of the world agricultural trade could help both developed and developing countries. Nowadays, within the WTO agreements, agricultural products from more than 40 least developed countries are allowed to enter European market duty free and no real threat to the Common market was noticed. Furthermore, there exists a system of non-duty licences towards third countries that results in non-European agricultural product entering European Common Market. The fact is that export of the EU agricultural production is deteriorating due to the decreasing subsidies, which is in contrast to slightly increasing import of agricultural products from non-EU countries. Sadly, this is caused also by overdeveloped bureaucratic network in EU, which is increasing the price and making EU products less competitive. According to the Author, production and consumption of cheese will grow according to changing food habits, but in future the Author expects a decrease in demand for butter and low-fat milk and these products will be relatively more exported thanks to the generally increasing world demand for these products. The production of milk will not change significantly; the number of milking cows is expected to decrease slightly and the utilisation should slightly increase. In medium-term conditions, the Author expects the generally decreased demand for milk and butter should be followed by an increased demand for milk products with higher added value...|$|R

Latent class methodology is one of the several conjoint segmentation procedures that overcome the limitations of aggregate analysis and a-priori segmentation. The main benefit of Latent class models is that market segment membership and regression parameters of each derived segment are estimated simultaneously.
