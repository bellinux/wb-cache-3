50|$|PCI-X {{revised the}} {{conventional}} PCI standard by doubling the maximum clock speed (from 66 MHz to 133 MHz) {{and hence the}} amount of data exchanged between the computer processor and peripherals. Conventional PCI supports up to 64 bits at 66 MHz (though anything above 32 bits at 33 MHz is seen only in high-end systems). The theoretical maximum amount of data exchanged between the processor and peripherals with PCI-X is 1.06 GB/s, compared to 133 MB/s with standard PCI. PCI-X also improves the fault tolerance of PCI, allowing, for example, faulty cards to be <b>reinitialized</b> or taken offline.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{refinements}} include reserving a code {{to indicate}} that the code table should be cleared and restored to its initial state (a [...] "clear code", typically the first value immediately after the values for the individual alphabet characters), and a code to indicate the end of data (a [...] "stop code", typically one greater than the clear code). The clear code allows the table to be <b>reinitialized</b> after it fills up, which lets the encoding adapt to changing patterns in the input data. Smart encoders can monitor the compression efficiency and clear the table whenever the existing table no longer matches the input well.|$|E
50|$|States are cloned {{just prior}} to {{transitioning}} to them. In the original DMC, the condition for cloning a state is when the transition from A to B is at least 2, and the count for B is at least 2 more than that. (When the second threshold is greater than 0, it guarantees that other states will still transition to B after cloning). Some implementations such as hook allow these thresholds {{to be set as}} parameters. In paq8l, these thresholds increase as memory is used up to slow the growth rate of new states. In most implementations, when memory is exhausted the model is discarded and <b>reinitialized</b> back to the original bytewise order 1 model.|$|E

50|$|Prevention of fratricide, {{as well as}} {{the ability}} to make ad hoc {{swarming}} attacks on targets of opportunity, {{is one of the major}} goals of combat data networking among units down to the level of individual tanks and soldiers. Blue Force Tracker is an early vehicle-level synchronization system, also operating in helicopters. These systems are still new and undergoing considerable improvement. One fratricide incident in Afghanistan came from the users not understanding that their target designation device <b>reinitialized,</b> after battery replacement, to the position of their designator, not of the target.

50|$|The 2013 Asian Le Mans Series was {{the second}} season of the Automobile Club de l'Ouest's Asian Le Mans Series {{endurance}} auto racing championship. The series was initially launched in 2009 at the 1000 km of Okayama, but did not resume the following year. The project was <b>reinitialized</b> by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) in 2012, with the Chinese S2M Group serving as the series promoter and TS Motorsport serving as organizer. It is the fourth 24 Hours of Le Mans-based series created by the ACO, following the American Le Mans Series, European Le Mans Series, and FIA World Endurance Championship. The four event season began in Inje, South Korea on 4 August and ended in Selangor, Malaysia on 8 December 2013.|$|E
5000|$|Cisco devices send CDP {{announcements}} to the multicast {{destination address}} 01-00-0c-cc-cc-cc, out each connected network interface. These multicast frames may {{be received by}} Cisco switches and other networking devices that support CDP into their connected network interface. This multicast destination is also used in other Cisco protocols such as [...] Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) Trunking Protocol (VTP). By default, CDP announcements are sent every 60 seconds on interfaces that support Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) headers, including Ethernet, Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). Each Cisco device that supports CDP stores the information received from other devices in a table that can be viewed using the show cdp neighbors command. This table is also accessible via Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The CDP table information is refreshed each time an announcement is received, and the holdtime for that entry is <b>reinitialized.</b> The holdtime specifies the lifetime of an entry in the table - if no announcements are received from a device for a period {{in excess of the}} holdtime, the device information is discarded (default 180 seconds).|$|E
5000|$|References {{cannot be}} uninitialized. Because it is {{impossible}} to <b>reinitialize</b> a reference, they must be initialized as soon as they are created.

For example: ...|$|R
50|$|A running {{program can}} {{deteriorate}} in performance over time, which is commonly called aging, as it runs and accumulates errors or leaks memory. This is not generally considered software rot, {{though it may}} {{have some of the}} same consequences. Usually, such a degraded state can be remedied by completely <b>reinitializing</b> its state, such as relaunching the program or restarting the operating system.|$|R
30|$|A {{drawback}} of the FROST {{framework is}} that it overwrites the heap of the previously running kernel, because the framework boots a full-fledged Linux kernel. This includes information like structures of the MMU, the list of running processes and the memory mappings of processes to physical locations. Additionally, the kernel likely <b>reinitializes</b> Input/Output (IO) devices, which resets the corresponding device memory.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} stop continual system crashes caused by this issue, System 6 and earlier running on a 68020 or a 68030 would force the machine into 24-bit mode, and would only {{recognize}} and address the first 8 megabytes of RAM, an obvious flaw in machines whose hardware was wired to accept up to 128 MB RAM - and whose product literature advertised this capability. With System 7, the Mac system software was finally made 32-bit clean, but there were still the problem of dirty ROMs. The {{problem was that the}} decision to use 24-bit or 32-bit addressing has to be made very early in the boot process, when the ROM routines initialized the Memory Manager to set up a basic Mac environment where NuBus ROMs and disk drivers are loaded and executed. Older ROMs did not have any 32-bit Memory Manager support and so was not possible to boot into 32-bit mode. Surprisingly, the first solution to this flaw was published by software utility company Connectix, whose 1991 product MODE32 <b>reinitialized</b> the Memory Manager and repeated early parts of the Mac boot process, allowing the system to boot into 32-bit mode and enabling the use of all the RAM in the machine. Apple licensed the software from Connectix later in 1991 and distributed it for free. The Macintosh IIci and later Motorola based Macintosh computers had 32-bit clean ROMs.|$|E
50|$|Congestion Management is {{performed}} automatically {{in a number}} of ways. Message routing will use alternative paths to minimize congestion. When Dynamic TDMA (DTDMA) is enabled, a unit that is not congested can donate spare transmission capacity to a congested unit. This affects the allocation of timeslots within the ONCS, but does not affect the NCT. All of this occurs automatically, with no operator or DLP actions required.The NMU can change the ONCS to redistribute capacity. This function, called Network Reconfiguration, causes little or no network interruption. The NMU provides or causes the SNC to generate a new NCS, which can have a different NCT. On successful reconfiguration the NCS becomes the new ONCS.Media parameters can be modified by the NMU in an attempt to increase the available capacity of the network. This requires the network to be temporarily paused and <b>reinitialized</b> with new parameters, which causes a minor interruption of network operations. This procedure is called Network Re-Initialization. The NMU can optionally provide or causes the SNC to generate a new NCS, which can have a different NCT. On successful Re-Initialization the NCS becomes the new ONCS.Unit congestion arises from two sources: the messages the DLP requests to be transmitted, and the messages received from other units that must be relayed to ensure that the messages are received by their addressees. The DLP has full control over messages it has requested to be transmitted. The DLP could delete selected requests to reduce the congestion, and it could reduce the rate of transmission requests.Tactical messages that are being relayed are normally not under control of the DLP. In cases of high congestion, however, the DLP can be informed of the relay messages and decide whether it wants to delete any. This last resort reduces the congestion, but it also affects the delivery of messages. This decision process is called Relay Flow Control.|$|E
40|$|Impulse {{differential}} inclusions, and in particular, hybrid control systems, {{are defined}} by a differential inclusion (or a control system) and a reset map. A run of an impulse differential inclusion is defined by a sequence of cadences, of <b>reinitialized</b> states and of motives describing the evolution along a given cadence between two distinct consecutive impulse times, {{the value of a}} motive {{at the end of a}} cadence being reset as the next <b>reinitialized</b> state of the next cadence. A cadenced run is then defined by constant cadence, initial state and motive, where the value at the end of the cadence is reset at the same <b>reinitialized</b> state. It plays the role of a “discontinuous ” periodic solution of a differential inclusion. We prove that if the sequence of <b>reinitialized</b> states of a run converges to some state, then the run converges to a cadenced run starting from this state, and that, under convexity assumptions, that a cadenced run does exist...|$|E
