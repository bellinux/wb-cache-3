5000|$|Two limited-budget {{productions}} followed Separate Tables: The <b>Rabbit</b> <b>Trap</b> and Cry Tough, both {{released in}} 1959. The <b>Rabbit</b> <b>Trap</b> was anticipated as another box office winner, as with Marty, {{based on a}} teleplay by JP Miller who adapted his story for the film. British film director Philip Leacock was brought over for the Ernest Borgnine starrer, with Don Rickles in a featured role. But the film only made an impact at the Locarno International Film Festival where Borgnine won the award for Best Actor. Cry Tough was initially set to be a big-budget picture starring Tony Curtis (also to be co-produced by his independent production company), but it eventually starred John Saxon instead.

40|$|When sap of {{asymptomatic}} or mealybug wilt-affected {{pineapple plants}} of the Smooth Cayenne group was negatively stained and examined in an electron microscope, clostero-like virus particles were occasionally seen.

An antiserum, made by injecting partially purified preparations of clostero-like particles into a <b>rabbit,</b> <b>trapped</b> and decorated the clostero-like particles. Using this antiserum, the clostero-like particles (c. 1700 - 1900 x 12 nn) were found in almost all plants tested of Smooth Cayenne selections C 10, C 13, C 30 and F- 180, the hybrid cv. 53 - 116 and a selection of the rough leaf Queen group. The particles were more readily trapped from extracts of roots of hybrid cv. 53 - 116 and Smooth Cayenne selection C 10 than from leaves; crowns and fruits. They were not detected in seedlings of {{a cross between a}} Queen selection and the Smooth Cayenne selection C 10. The clostero-like particles are similar to those reported to occur in pineapple plants in Hawaii and South Africa. This is the first report of their occurrence in Australia. Trapping and decoration tests of particles in pineapples in quarantine from Brazil, France, Malaysia and Taiwan indicated that a similar clostero-like virus occurs in all these countries...|$|R

50|$|On top of {{promoting}} {{a backlog of}} Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions films that were coming out in 1959-1960 (The <b>Rabbit</b> <b>Trap,</b> Cry Tough, Summer of the Seventeenth Doll, The Devil's Disciple, Take a Giant Step and The Unforgiven), Hecht was busy planning future United Artists-financed films from the H-H-L unit (including The Way West). He also formed a new film production company with Canadian actor Glenn Ford. Their first film together was to be Evan Hunter's novel, A Matter of Conviction, concerning members of a Harlem street gang tried for murder (later released as The Young Savages). Glenn Ford had already starred in another Hunter adaptation, Blackboard Jungle; the film was nominated for four Oscars. Hecht was hoping that the new combo would be as successful and hired more top Hollywood personnel to work on The Young Savages; John Gay to write the screenplay and Robert Rossen to direct. But {{by the end of}} the year, Glenn Ford had left the project and in early 1960 Rossen dropped out to focus on his future Oscar-nominated film, The Hustler.|$|E

There, geyser-riding turtles and laughing, singing bullfrogs, and dancing water fountains guide the log to a dark area in which Br'er Rabbit has been caught by Br'er Fox in a cave of stalactites and stalagmites.

5000|$|The Paleo-Indian had a {{straightforward}} movement pattern: follow and hunt the big animals. The Archaic individuals followed a new pattern called [...] "making the seasonal rounds" [...] where {{they moved to}} familiar places based upon the growing seasons of plants, their major source of food. In the spring, summer and early fall women harvested seeds, nuts, fruit, grasses, juniper berries and mesquite beans. Any surplus food was stored for later use. Men hunted small game like <b>rabbits</b> using <b>traps</b> and snares. During {{the fall and winter}} men hunted deer, big horn sheep, bison and antelope with the atlatl and darts.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of a lack}} of {{food and}} an {{upcoming}} strict winter, one of these Gwich'in nomad groups decides to leave behind two old women in the snow-covered wilderness.Left back and dumbfounded in fright, 75-year-old Sa' and 80-year-old Ch'idzigyaak remain seated in the snow after the leader announced the decision to the tribe. Before moving on, Ch'idzigyaak's daughter gives them an untanned moose's skin, or babiche. As another familial gesture, Ch'idzigyaak's grandson hides his osseous hatchet, which is the symbol of his manhood, for the two women. The tribe leaves. Left back to themselves, the two women at first sit silently. In their desperation, however, they decide it's better to die trying to survive. Sa' succeeds in killing a squirrel using the hatchet as a weapon. The two women boil the meat and drink the broth. They then go on to set <b>rabbit</b> <b>traps</b> {{and in the middle of}} the night wake to animal noises: they find two <b>rabbits</b> in their <b>traps.</b> The women now decide to move on to hunt better game. In order to cross the snow, they make themselves snowshoes. Eventually, they reach a river where their tribe had fished successfully in the warmer season. On each night of their journey of several days, the women dig a snow shelter protected by animal hides. They save the embers of their campfires to start a new fire the next evening. In this way, the fire never goes out. In the mornings, the two old women complain about their pains in the joints. Finally they reach their familiar river and set up a winter camp there. However, they hide inland from The People, another tribe, for fear of cannibalism. Fortunately, the two old women succeed in building up a generous supply of food made up of smoked musquashes and beavers. In the summer, they catch large amounts of fish and manage to dry and store them away.|$|R

50|$|With Lancaster in the picture, The Young Savages {{headed in}} a new direction. Hecht hired J.P. Miller, who had worked on The <b>Rabbit</b> <b>Trap</b> and had since been {{nominated}} for an Emmy Award, and Edward Anhalt, a two-time Academy Award nominee who had won a Best Screenplay Oscar for the 1951 film Panic in the Streets, to rewrite the script. Meanwhile, Lancaster approached television director John Frankenheimer. Frankenheimer had already done a low-budget picture, The Young Stranger, a few years prior but The Young Savages has since been considered by most as his true film debut. Lancaster and Frankenheimer would make {{a total of five}} films together. In turn, Frankenheimer hired another television acquaintance, the promising young actor Sydney Pollack, as a dialogue coach for the teenage hoodlums who needed an authentic New York City accents. The Young Savages was partly filmed on location in New York City with three-time Academy Award nominated cinematographer Lionel Lindon. Lindon had won an Oscar in 1957 for his work on Around the World in Eighty Days. The cast featured Shelley Winters, who had just won an Oscar for The Diary of Anne Frank, Edward Andrews, who had just made Elmer Gantry with Lancaster and Dina Merrill, who had just finished Blake Edwards' Operation Petticoat with Cary Grant and Tony Curtis. Telly Savalas made his film debut playing the role of a tough cop, not unlike his future character in Kojak. The Young Savages was released in the spring of 1961 through United Artists, but unfortunately was not the success that Hecht had anticipated.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, Alo, Rich's best man, has {{not brought}} a proper map with him, and drives {{them into the}} middle of nowhere. To make matters worse, the van breaks down. Angry with him, Rich and Grace manage to hitch a ride to the church with a couple going the same way. They give the gang directions, and they set off on foot. Liv and Matty, however, lose {{confidence}} in Alo's navigation skills and decide to set off on their own. They invite Franky to go along with them, and despite Mini's pleas, Franky agrees. Rich and Grace finally make it to the church, but discover they have missed their slot. Fortunately, the priest is able to offer them a slot in an hour, giving the gang that amount of time to get there. For fear that they won't show up, Grace recruits an elderly couple. Liv, Matty and Franky, meanwhile, take some cocaine and reach a nearby village. They break into the village church (not the one they are meant to go to) and Matty begins to play the piano. Liv, remembering his reaction at seeing her kiss Franky in Twelfth Night, starts to seduce Franky in front of him. He shakes his head at her, and they are chased off by the gun-wielding church owner. After reaching safety, Matty and Liv have an argument about Liv's actions in the church, and she admits that she is afraid of losing him. Franky keeps going, and Liv desperately begs Matty to stay with her, but he chooses to go after Franky instead. Mini, meanwhile, gets fed up with Alo and Nick's seemingly uncaring behaviour, because she is worried that something will happen to her friend. She splits off from the two and goes to find Liv, Matty and Franky herself. This leaves Alo and Nick to take their own route. On the way, Nick gets snared in a <b>rabbit</b> <b>trap.</b> Alo manages to free his leg and helps him limp on, until they reach a road. Mini manages to meet up with Liv, and, after discovering that Franky is missing, admits that she is frightened for Franky’s safety, which prompts Liv to question whether Mini has a crush on Franky; she and Liv reconcile and set off to find Franky and Matty. Problems get worse when Professor Blood, while having lunch, sees Grace's location on his GPS and immediately goes after her.|$|E

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{longitudinal}} study of the epidemiology of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) in New Zealand, serum samples were obtained from trapped feral animals that may have consumed European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) carcasses (non-target species). During a 21 -month period when RHDV infection was monitored in a defined wild rabbit population, 16 feral house cats (Felis catus), 11 stoats (Mustela erminea), four ferrets (Mustela furo) and 126 hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) were incidentally captured in the <b>rabbit</b> <b>traps.</b> The proportions of samples that were seropositive to RHDV were 38 % for cats, 18 % for stoats, 25 % for ferrets and 4 % for hedgehogs. Seropositive non-target species were trapped in April 2000, {{in the absence of}} an overt epidemic of rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) in the rabbit population, but evidence of recent infection in rabbits was shown. Seropositive non-target species were found up to 2. 5 months before and 1 month after this RHDV activity in wild rabbits was detected. Seropositive predators were also trapped on the site between 1 and 4. 5 months after a dramatic RHD epidemic in February 2001. This study has shown that high antibody titres can be found in non-target species when there is no overt evidence of RHDV infection in the rabbit population, although a temporal relationship could not be assessed statistically owning to the small sample sizes. Predators and scavengers might be able to contribute to localised spread of RHDV through their movements...|$|R
