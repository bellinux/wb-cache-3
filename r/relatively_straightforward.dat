5|$|In the All-Ireland semi-final against Armagh (who {{were meeting}} Tyrone {{for the third}} time that year), Canavan scored with the last kick of the game, winning the match for Tyrone. Kevin McStay, a former Mayo player, {{described}} it as the point of the season, despite the free kick being from a <b>relatively</b> <b>straightforward</b> position.|$|E
5|$|The {{accuracy}} of hurricane forecast models can vary significantly from storm to storm. For some storms the factors affecting the hurricane track are <b>relatively</b> <b>straightforward,</b> and the models {{are not only}} accurate but they produce similar forecasts, while for other storms the factors affecting the hurricane track are more complex and different models produce very different forecasts.|$|E
5|$|While {{a direct}} route by sea {{has not been}} {{available}} since {{the sinking of the}} Joola, the traveller from Dakar may use various other means of transportation in order to arrive in Basse Casamance. Some national roads connect to Ziguinchor, down the N1 to Kaolack. The N4 and N5 roads cross the Gambia (both the country and the river), the former running through Nioro du Rip to Farafenni, and the latter crossing the river to Banjul. The two roads merge in Bignona before descending to Ziguinchor. However, traffic is forbidden on both roads between 7p.m. and 10a.m., and the routes are subject to frequent accidents and constant demining operations. Alternatively, it is possible to travel by plane to the airport in Ziguinchor or Cap Skirring, or to travel by boat to one of these locations. Reaching Carabane from either town is <b>relatively</b> <b>straightforward.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tame {{problems}} (or puzzles {{or technical}} challenges) have <b>relatively</b> precise, <b>straightforward</b> formulations {{that are often}} amenable to solution with some predetermined technical fix or algorithm.

25|$|The complex {{processing}} of pain-temperature {{information in the}} thalamus and cerebral cortex (as opposed to the <b>relatively</b> simple, <b>straightforward</b> {{processing of}} touch-position information) reflects a phylogenetically older, more primitive sensory system. The detailed information received from peripheral touch-position receptors is superimposed on a background of awareness, memory and emotions partially set by peripheral pain-temperature receptors.|$|R
5|$|Team Razer faced Firestorm3 {{in their}} first battle of the series grand final, in a rematch from the All-Stars semi-final from earlier that year. Whilst victory in that battle had been <b>relatively</b> <b>straightforward,</b> Firestorm3 had {{increased}} the thickness of its armour for this battle {{to make it harder}} for Razer to inflict major damage. This tactic almost worked: Razer was unable to completely immobilise the robot. The fight ended in a close judges' decision—in Razer's favour. Victory handed Razer a place in the series five grand final against Bigger Brother, rebuilt after being heavily damaged by Hypno-Disc in its previous battle. Razer gripped Bigger Brother early in the battle, causing damage to its opponent's drive chain from which Bigger Brother never recovered. The final ended in a stalemate and went to the judges; their decision came back in favour of Razer. Along with the UK Championship, Razer also took home a third Best Design award.|$|E
5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} {{a number}} of delicate problems {{that had never been}} encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a <b>relatively</b> <b>straightforward</b> operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons {{on either side of the}} ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a cofferdam around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating sheerlegs attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|E

5000|$|The {{method is}} <b>relatively</b> quick and <b>straightforward</b> to employ. With {{a greater degree}} of group {{discussion}} in use of the technique, there is more qualitative data that is produced; this can be considered as a useful by-product of the assessment.|$|R
2500|$|Until 2003, {{a single}} version of D/L was in use.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a concise {{nonlinear}} {{robust control}} {{scheme based on}} the frequency domain is proposed. Compared with the arbitrary selection of weighting function in classical H ∞ mixed sensitivity robust control design procedures, the CGSA methods gives a <b>relatively</b> more <b>straightforward</b> and concise design procedure for MIMO robust control problem. In the simulations, the CGSA is applied to an integrated rudder and fin control loop {{to indicate that the}} integrated rudder and fin CGSA control scheme is very feasible for future practical application...|$|R
5000|$|For {{many types}} of problems, the {{classical}} PIC method invented by Buneman, Dawson, Hockney, Birdsall, Morse and others is <b>relatively</b> intuitive and <b>straightforward</b> to implement.

50|$|Parallel-sided {{shear plates}} are {{sometimes}} used, but {{the interpretation of}} the interference fringes of wedged plates is <b>relatively</b> easy and <b>straightforward.</b> Wedged shear plates produce a graded path difference between the front and back surface reflections; as a consequence, a parallel beam of light produces a linear fringe pattern within the overlap.|$|R

5000|$|Intelligence {{testing in}} a {{research}} context is <b>relatively</b> more <b>straightforward</b> than in a clinical context. In research, intelligence is tested and results are generally as obtained, however in a clinical setting intelligence may be impaired so estimates are required for comparison with obtained results. Premorbid estimates can be determined {{through a number of}} methods, the most common include: comparison of test results to expected achievement levels based on prior education and occupation and the use of hold tests which are based on cognitive faculties which are generally good indicators of intelligence and thought to be more resistant to cognitive damage, e.g. language.|$|R
40|$|A {{mixture of}} shifted {{asymmetric}} Laplace distributions is introduced {{and used for}} clustering and classification. A variant of the EM algorithm is developed for parameter estimation by exploiting {{the relationship with the}} general inverse Gaussian distribution. This approach is mathematically elegant and <b>relatively</b> computationally <b>straightforward.</b> Our novel mixture modelling approach is demonstrated on both simulated and real data to illustrate clustering and classification applications. In these analyses, our mixture of shifted asymmetric Laplace distributions performs favourably when compared to the popular Gaussian approach. This work, which marks an important step in the non-Gaussian model-based clustering and classification direction, concludes with discussion as well as suggestions for future work...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a concise robust controller design of integrated rudder and fin control system in {{use of the}} closed loop gain shaping algorithm (CGSA) strategy. Compared with the arbitrary selection of weighting function in integrated rudder and fin H ∞ mixed sensitivity control design procedures, the CGSA methods provided a <b>relatively</b> more <b>straightforward</b> and concise design method. Simulations were described that the overall performance of each CGSA rudder and fin control loop and the interaction between them. Hence, {{it can be concluded}} that the integrated rudder and fin CGSA control scheme is very suitable to present and indeed feasible for future practical application...|$|R
25|$|Work {{has been}} carried out at a number of {{stations}} north of the Thames to extend the platforms to accommodate 12-car trains.

25|$|While this in {{principle}} can work, {{it is extremely}} difficult to build the hardware to protect the secret key against a sufficiently determined adversary. Many such systems have failed in the field. Once the secret key is known, building a version of the hardware that performs no checks is often <b>relatively</b> <b>straightforward.</b> In addition user verification provisions are frequently subject to attack, pirate decryption being among the most frequented ones.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{though the}} {{extraction}} of morphometric parameters like brain mass or liquor volume may be <b>relatively</b> <b>straightforward</b> in post mortem samples, most studies in living subjects will by necessity have to use an indirect approach: A spatial representation of the brain or its components is obtained by some appropriate neuroimaging technique, and the parameters of interest can then be analyzed on that basis. Such a structural representation of the brain is also a prerequisite for the interpretation of functional neuroimaging.|$|E
50|$|The Melon Slice folding {{system is}} <b>relatively</b> {{conventional}} and <b>straightforward.</b> First, it folds at the pedals {{and then at}} the handlebar stem.

30|$|The complex {{nature of}} state taxes on alcohol in India makes {{summarizing}} {{them in a}} uniform and comprehensive way across states and time difficult. There are different taxes on different kind of alcohols within and across states (for ex., foreign imported liquor versus domestically produced beer). Duties range from flat-fees to percentages of the manufactured cost, retail price or the government-set market price. Further, the taxes can be levied on different units, ranging from per bulk liter to by proof level (Rahman 2003). Prohibition and alcohol regulations by age, however, are <b>relatively</b> more <b>straightforward.</b> We also include state-by-wave fixed effects in some specifications, which absorb any potential state-time changes in alcohol taxes.|$|R
25|$|For {{medication}} in tablet form it is <b>relatively</b> <b>straightforward</b> {{to calculate}} {{the number of days}} supply based on a prescription. Some medications are less straightforward though because a prescription of a given number of doses may have a variable number of days supply because the number of doses to be taken per-day varies, for example with preventative corticosteroid inhalers prescribed for asthma where the number of inhalations to be taken daily may vary between individuals based on the severity of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Persisting {{with further}} {{attempts}} {{to convince the}} composer, Ricordi had also broached {{the idea of a}} collaboration with Boito for a new opera based on Shakespeare's Othello. Verdi admired the dramatic works of Shakespeare and had, throughout his career, desired to create operas based on his plays, although his one attempt at doing so, Macbeth in 1847, although initially successful, was not well received when revised for performance in Paris in 1865. Because of its <b>relatively</b> <b>straightforward</b> story, the play Othello was selected as a likely target.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the atomic}} radii (e.g. in Fig. 4) are only {{slightly}} less than the distance between bonded atoms, the iconic spheres intersect, and in the CPK models, this was achieved by planar truncations along the bonding directions, the section being circular. When raster graphics became affordable, {{one of the common}} approaches was to replicate CPK models in silico. It is <b>relatively</b> <b>straightforward</b> to calculate the circles of intersection, but more complex to represent a model with hidden surface removal. A useful side product is that a conventional value for the molecular volume can be calculated.|$|E
40|$|In the diploma thesis, {{a method}} for {{preparation}} of the unsaturated C 15 -C 20 tiacumicin fragment was developed. Tiacumicin is classified as a macrolidone antibiotic. Although three syntheses of tiacumicin have been recently published, this study has aimed to develop a novel pathway for its preparation utilizing catalytic reactions instead of stoichiometric ones. In the second part, an enantioselective allylation of (E) - 3 -jod- 2 -methylpropenal has been developed applying catalysis {{by a series of}} N,N'-dioxide catalysts. The asymmetric induction achieved in the allylation was up to 99 % ee.

30|$|Besides {{the aspects}} {{previously}} mentioned, both Al-Baik and Miller (2015) and Ahmad et al. (2018) dedicate {{part of their}} reports to enumerate and analyze the Kanban reported benefits and challenges, which {{is directly related to}} this synthesis study. Not by chance, these two works were used {{as the basis for the}} identification of the primary studies and as the source for the aggregated benefits and challenges. However, since the benefits and challenges were not the sole goals of these two works, the way that these issues were addressed is <b>relatively</b> more <b>straightforward</b> compared to this synthesis. They used an approach that can be directly related to the vote-counting strategy, which limitations are broadly discussed in the technical literate (Pickard et al. 1998). Thus, this synthesis study represents an additional contribution to these secondary studies.|$|R
