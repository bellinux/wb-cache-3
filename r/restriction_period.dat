40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three studies on hedge fund risk taking and herding. The first paper documents the risk taking of hedge funds {{in the last three}} years prior to liquidation using the measures of return volatility. I find that the risk reduction is the greatest for the liquidated sample during the last two and three years as the fund performance drops. Moreover, the volatility-hazard regression shows that the risk taking of funds reduces during the last year prior to fund liquidation as the predicted hazard rates in the previous year increase. The evidence indicates that the liquidation is forced when the performance of the portfolios drops below the liquidation barrier. The second paper investigates the risk taking choices of hedge funds following redemption requests. I find that hedge funds with longer <b>restriction</b> <b>periods</b> tend to take lower risk if there are no significant redemption requests. Second, hedge funds with short <b>restriction</b> <b>periods</b> tend to increase risks following redemption requests. The increase in risk is larger for large redemptions than for small redemptions. However, if there are large redemptions during market crisis, hedge funds tend to take higher post risk even when the <b>restriction</b> <b>periods</b> are longer. The third paper examines hedge funds herding in response to macroeconomic uncertainty during periods of high volatility with extreme market returns. I find that hedge funds that follow directional strategies herd towards the consensus during periods of high macroeconomic uncertainty. The degree of herding towards the consensus becomes greater during periods of economic downturn. I also find that the degree of herding for live funds following directional strategies is greater during periods of high macroeconomic uncertainty in down markets. This suggests that the similar trading manners of the directional fund managers in times of macroeconomic uncertainty could be beneficial for fund survival...|$|R

40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} suggests that the circadian clock is closely associated with metabolic regulation. However, whether an impaired circadian clock is a direct cause of metabolic dysregulation such as body weight gain is not clearly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that body weight gain in mice is not significantly changed by restricting feeding period to daytime or nighttime. The expression of peripheral circadian clock genes was altered by feeding <b>period</b> <b>restriction,</b> while the expression of light-regulated hypothalamic circadian clock genes was unaffected by either a normal chow diet (NCD) or a high-fat diet (HFD). In the liver, the expression pattern of circadian clock genes, including Bmal 1, Clock, and Per 2, was changed by different feeding <b>period</b> <b>restrictions.</b> Moreover, the expression of lipogenic genes, gluconeogenic genes, and fatty acid oxidation-related genes in the liver was also altered by feeding <b>period</b> <b>restriction.</b> Given that feeding <b>period</b> <b>restriction</b> does not affect body weight gain with a NCD or HFD, {{it is likely that the}} amount of food consumed might be a crucial factor in determining body weight. Collectively, these data suggest that feeding <b>period</b> <b>restriction</b> modulates the expression of peripheral circadian clock genes, which is uncoupled from light-sensitive hypothalamic circadian clock genes...|$|R

This study sampled the entire population of AMC airfields with BASH Phase II flight <b>restrictions.</b> The test <b>period</b> consisted of damaging birdstrike data collected 5 years before BASH Phase II operations began (1991 - 1995), and the years during BASH Phase II (1996 - 2000). It was hypothesized that since the implementation of BASH Phase II flight restrictions, there had been no significant reduction to the number of birdstrikes on AMC aircraft. During the period before BASH Phase II flight restrictions (1991 - 1995), AMC had a total of 35 reported damaging birdstrikes during the historic Phase II periods. Damaging birdstrikes increased in AMC to 44 from 1996 - 2000, when Phase II flight restrictions were imposed at these bases. The study concluded that not only was there no significant reduction in damaging birdstrikes, there was actually a 21 % increase of damaging birdstrikes, AMC wide.

40|$|Although major {{research}} efforts {{have focused on}} how specific components of foodstuffs affect health, relatively {{little is known about}} a more fundamental aspect of diet, the frequency and circadian timing of meals, and potential benefits of intermittent periods with no or very low energy intakes.

Emerging findings from studies of animal models and human subjects suggest that intermittent energy <b>restriction</b> <b>periods</b> of as little as 16 h can improve health indicators and counteract disease processes. The mechanisms involve a metabolic shift to fat metabolism and ketone production, and stimulation of adaptive cellular stress responses that prevent and repair molecular damage.

Further, a fund’s failure probability predicts negatively the fund’s future returns. Sorting hedge funds into quintiles by the predicted failure probability based on 7 -month lagged information, I find that the return spread (long low failure risk funds and short high failure risk funds) is 7. 6 ~ 8. 2 % per year after adjusting for nine risk factors and a return smoothing effect over the period of July 1996 to September 2007. Moreover, the negative relationship between a fund’s failure probability and its future returns is not subsumed by the effects of performance persistence, flow-performance relation, fund age and size, volatility, backfill history, share restrictions, and managerial ownership...|$|R

Gilts were fed either a corn-soybean meal diet or a corn-soybean meal diet supplemented with crystalline lysine.

The restricted-realimentated (RR) feeding period consisted of a 21 -day <b>restriction</b> <b>period</b> and a 21 - day ad libitum eating period (realimentation). During the <b>restriction</b> <b>period,</b> pigs were fed to maintain body weight. Results indicated that during the <b>restriction</b> <b>period,</b> gilts had a decrease (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) in the weight of the liver, kidneys and small intestine. During the first week of ad libitum eating, organ weights of gilts in the RR group increased dramatically. Weights of the liver and stomach of gilts in the RR group were greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) than the ad libitum (AL) fed gilts during week one of ad libitum eating. In addition, weights of the kidneys, small intestine and mesentery were not different between feeding regimens after the first week of ad libitum eating. Carcass and ultrasound measurements taken before and after the <b>restriction</b> <b>period</b> showed a numerical decrease in tenth-rib backfat and an increase in longissimus muscle area during the 21 -day <b>restriction</b> <b>period.</b> These measurements are consistent with the decrease (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) in the percentage of carcass fat and an increase (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in carcass protein percentage caused by restricted feeding. Although the carcass protein percentage was greater in the RR gilts at the start of the ad libitum eating period, carcass protein accretion was greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) in the AL gilts versus the RR gilts during weeks one and two of ad libitum eating. Gilts in the RR group exhibited compensatory organ growth during the first week of the ad libitum eating period. Also, during a <b>restriction</b> <b>period,</b> growing gilts are able to use fat stores and repartition visceral protein to maintain lean muscle deposition. Growing pigs often face environmental and health challenges which limit energy and nutrient intake. This research has identified that protein from liver and other visceral depots can be used to help provide amino acids for muscle growth during prolonged feed restriction. Also, the weight and composition of visceral organs are restored quickly when refeeding commences. Because these tissues account for a significant portion of pig’s daily energy requirement, fundamental knowledge documenting how key organs respond to energy and nutrient intake will ultimately help provide insight into how pigs will adapt to specific nutritional regimens. Additional research is needed to see how organs and muscle adaptations change as the pig progresses through the growing and finishing phases...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze genotypic responses of eight rose bush cultivars to alternation of water <b>restriction</b> and re-watering <b>periods,</b> with soil water potential of - 20 and - 10 kPa respectively. Responses were evaluated at the architectural level through 3 D digitalization using six architectural variables and at the physiological level by measuring stomatal conductance, water content, hormones [abscisic acid (ABA), auxin, cytokinins, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid (SA) ], sugars (sucrose, fructose, and glucose), and proline. Highly significant genotype and watering effects were revealed for all the architectural variables measured, as well as genotype × watering interaction, with three distinct genotypic architectural responses to water restriction – weak, moderate and strong – represented by Hw 336, ‘Baipome’ and ‘The Fairy,’ respectively. The physiological analysis explained, at least in part, the more moderate architectural response of ‘Baipome’ compared to ‘The Fairy,’ but not that of Hw 336 which is an interspecific hybrid. Such physiological responses in ‘Baipome’ could be related to: the maintenance of the stimulation of budbreak and photosynthetic activity during water <b>restriction</b> <b>periods</b> due to a higher concentration in conjugated cytokinins (cCK) and to a lower concentration in SA; a better resumption of budbreak during the re-watering periods due to a lower concentration in ABA during this period.

Six electronic databases were searched from inception to October 2016. Only randomized controlled trials of interventions (≥ 12 weeks) in adults with overweight and obesity were included. Five studies were included in this review. Weekly intermittent energy <b>restriction</b> <b>periods</b> ranged from an energy intake between 1757 and 6276 kJ/d− 1. The mean duration of the interventions was 26 (range 14 to 48) weeks. Meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference in weight loss between weekly intermittent energy restriction and continuous energy restriction post-intervention (weighted mean difference: − 1. 36 [− 3. 23, 0. 51], p = 0. 15) and at follow-up (weighted mean difference: − 0. 82 [− 3. 76, 2. 11], p = 0. 58). Both interventions achieved comparable weight loss of &# 62; 5 kg and therefore were associated with clinical benefits to health. The findings support the use of weekly intermittent energy restriction as an alternative option for the treatment of obesity.
