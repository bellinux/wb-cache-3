500|$|On its {{way across}} central New Jersey, Route 33 {{traverses}} three counties: Mercer, Middlesex, and Monmouth. Beginning in Trenton as Greenwood Avenue, Route 33 is a two-lane road, with one lane in each direction. Once it merges with U.S. Route 130 in Robbinsville Township, Route 33 has two lanes in each direction. After crossing into East Windsor Township, Route 33 veers off and becomes a local road going into Hightstown. After passing {{through the center of}} town, Route 33 again enters East Windsor Township where it becomes an avenue with a total of at least four lanes, with two lanes in each direction underneath the Turnpike overpass. Before leaving Mercer County, the road intersects with an interchange at Route 133 that provides access to Exit 8 of the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). Route 33 then crosses into Monroe Township, where it is slowly becoming a <b>residential</b> <b>access</b> road for new communities. It then continues into Millstone Township as a rural avenue. Continuing into Manalapan Township, the avenue again becomes a <b>residential</b> <b>access</b> road. At the ramp for Route 33 Business, the avenue turns into a freeway bypass, known as the Freehold Bypass. Route 33 bypasses Freehold Borough to the south staying within Freehold Township. [...] Within Freehold Borough, Route 33 Business is the original alignment of Route 33 before the bypass was built.|$|E

[...] Route 33 passes along the {{southern}} section of the Naval Weapons Station Earle and then becomes a <b>residential</b> <b>access</b> road. The road then runs concurrent with Route 34 and becomes a divided four-lane avenue as it travels into Wall Township. Routes 33/34 come upon a roundabout and they both split as Route 33 continues east thru a rural section into Tinton Falls. It goes past the intersection with Route 66, past the interchange with the Garden State Parkway, across the highway and into Neptune Township. The road passes through suburban and rural sections until it comes upon the interchange with Route 18. Immediately past the exit, Route 33 borders Neptune City on the south and Neptune Township on the north for a brief stretch before completely re-entering Neptune Township. After it crosses Route 35, the avenue ends and becomes a two-lane road for a brief stretch. Route 33 then ends at Route 71, just west of Ocean Grove.|$|E

40|$|Network {{dimensioning}} is {{an indispensable}} component of QoS provisioning in the <b>residential</b> multi-service IPbased <b>access</b> networks. This paper discusses network dimensioning of the <b>residential</b> multi-service IP-based <b>access</b> networks over Ethernet thoroughly, i. e. a Broadband <b>Residential</b> Ethernet-Based <b>Access</b> Network (BREAN), {{and tries to}} find a pragmatic engineering method of network dimensioning. We propose that the layer 2 Ethernet domain of the BREAN implements EF (PHB and PDB) and AF (PHB and PDB) services of DiffServ {{so that we can}} deploy a same method of network dimensioning in the whole BREAN. This paper investigates the past study efforts of network dimensioning, and expends or amends some study results with DiffServ, such as the universal link model, the dimensioning for the elastic traffic and the stream traffic, traffic matrix and user model. By systematic method, combining these indispensable components gives a rather pragmatic engineering method of network dimensioning in the BREAN, offering PTOS, VoIP, TV, VoD and Internet access, etc. We validate our method of network dimensioning by the simulations, and the simulation results illustrate that our method can appropriately estimate the bandwidth requirements of the different classes based on DiffServ framework, reasonably plan bandwidth capacity of the network links, and promise multi-service QoS provisioning without overburden always in the BREAN...|$|R

50|$|Access to the Internet can {{be divided}} into dial-up and {{broadband}} access. Around the start of the 21st century, most <b>residential</b> <b>access</b> was by dial-up, while access from businesses was usually by higher speed connections.

40|$|Unbundled {{infrastructure}} firms provide conduits {{for electricity}} transmission, residential communications, etc. but are vertically disintegrated from “content” {{functions such as}} electricity generation or world-wide-web pages. These conduits are being deregulated, and this dissertation examines whether the deregulated conduits will behave in an efficient and competitive manner. The dissertation presents three essays, each of which develops a theoretical model {{of the behavior of}} conduit firms in a market environment. The first essay considers the prospects for competition between multiple conduits in the emerging market for broadband (high-speed) <b>residential</b> Internet <b>access.</b> It finds that such competition is likely to emerge as demand for these services increase. The second essay shows how a monopoly electricity or natural gas transmission conduit can facilitate collusion between suppliers of the good. It shows that this is an inefficient effect of standard price-cap regulation. The third essay considers the supply chain of <b>residential</b> Internet <b>access</b> and evaluates proposed “open access” regulation that would allow more than one firm to serve customers over the same physical infrastructure. It shows that the amount of content available to consumers does not necessarily increase under open access. ...|$|R
