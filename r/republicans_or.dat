25|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Republican voters control {{most of the}} state, {{especially}} in the more rural and suburban areas outside of the cities; Democratic strength is mostly confined to the urban cores {{of the four major}} cities, and is particularly strong in the cities of Nashville and Memphis. The latter area includes a large African-American population. Historically, Republicans had their greatest strength in East Tennessee before the 1960s. Tennessee's 1st and 2nd congressional districts, based in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville, respectively, are among the few historically Republican districts in the South. Those districts' residents supported the Union over the Confederacy during the Civil War; they identified with the GOP after the war and have stayed with that party ever since. The first has been in Republican hands continuously since 1881, and <b>Republicans</b> (<b>or</b> their antecedents) have held it for all but four years since 1859. The second has been held continuously by <b>Republicans</b> <b>or</b> their antecedents since 1859.|$|E

Time magazine reported on December 21, 1936 that six U.S. fliers were on the ocean liner SS Normandie, headed for Spain, to join their leader, Bert Acosta.

25|$|According to a Pew Research poll, the Democratic Party {{has become}} more {{socially}} liberal and secular compared to how it was in 1987.

In the same poll, a survey of registered voters stated that 47% identified as Democrats or leaned towards the party; the same poll found that 40% of registered voters identified as <b>Republicans</b> <b>or</b> leaned towards the Republican party.|$|E
25|$|In May 1793 the Vendeans or Whites {{went on the}} {{offensive}} in the east. Bonchamps had 10,000 rebels watching Angers, Elbée and 20,000 men of the Grand Army threatened Bressuire, Charette watched Nantes and Les Sables-d'Olonne and Royrand held the southern front. Bonchamps, Lescure and La Rochejaquelein took Bressuire, won the Battle of Thouars and stormed La Châtaigneraie on 13 May. At Pissotte near Fontenay-le-Comte the Vendeans were beaten by Chalbos on 16 May and lost all their artillery. However, they rallied and gathered 35,000 men under Bonchamps, Elbée, Lescure and La Rochejaquelein and attacked again. In the Battle of Fontenay-le-Comte on 25 May out of 14,000 effectives, Chalbos lost 4,000 men and 40 guns. Vendean casualties were estimated at 1,000. A rebel advance on Niort was put off because the <b>Republicans</b> <b>or</b> Blues under François Nicolas de Salomon and Leigonyer threatened Thouars and Cholet. In the west, the garrison of Les Sables-d'Olonne repulsed Cathelineau, Charette and Stofflet, but the Vendeans won other actions and menaced Nantes.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{them later}} joined the new Irish Republican Army (IRA) at various times, but the Citizen Army under Connolly's elected successor, chief Rising bomb-maker and builder James O'Neill, took command of Dublin county two miles {{either side of}} the Liffey River and Kildare as far as Maynooth during the War of Independence ending in the Treaty of 1922 when 26 of the 32 Irish {{counties}} became the Free State. O'Neill was also joint intelligence and logistics chief under Michael Collins' IRA. O'Neill and ICA units were involved in various IRA operations during the War of Independence, including the burning of the Customs House in May 1921 and rescue of IRA arms after. During the fighting in Dublin that began the Irish Civil War in July 1922, some elements of the ICA (which by this time had about 140 members) were involved in the Anti-Treaty IRA occupation and defence of the Four Courts while others occupied Liberty Hall, the Trade Union headquarters, to prevent it falling into the hands of either the <b>Republicans</b> <b>or</b> the Free State Army.|$|E
25|$|MacDonald is {{best known}} for his trilogy that {{analyzes}} Judaism and Jewish culture from the perspective of evolutionary psychology, comprising A People That Shall Dwell Alone (1994), Separation and Its Discontents (1998), and The Culture of Critique (1998). He proposes that Judaism is a group evolutionary strategy to enhance the ability of Jews to out-compete non-Jews for resources. Using the term Jewish ethnocentrism, he argues that Judaism fosters in Jews a series of marked genetic traits, including above-average verbal intelligence and a strong tendency toward collectivist behavior, as manifested in a series of influential intellectual movements. MacDonald repeatedly emphasizes that he does not argue that all Jews in all circumstances display the traits he identifies; for example, his Understanding Jewish Influence argues that neoconservatism is a Jewish intellectual movement, while MacDonald also points out that American Jews generally favor the Democratic Party, not <b>Republicans</b> <b>or</b> conservatives and he also points out that in the 2000 US Presidential Election about 80% of the Jewish vote went to United States Vice President Al Gore, who was campaigning against George W. Bush, whose campaign MacDonald claims was heavily staffed with and influenced by neoconservatives.|$|E
500|$|While {{some conservatives}} have {{condemned}} {{the show for}} its vulgarity, a growing population of people who hold center-right political beliefs, including teenagers and young adults, have embraced the show for its tendency to mock liberal viewpoints and lampoon liberal celebrities and icons. Political commentator Andrew Sullivan dubbed the group South Park <b>Republicans,</b> <b>or</b> South Park conservatives. Sullivan averred {{that members of the}} group are [...] "extremely skeptical of political correctness but also are socially liberal on many issues", though he says the phrase applied to them is meant {{to be more of a}} casual indication of beliefs than a strong partisan label. Brian C. Anderson describes the group as [...] "generally characterized by holding strong libertarian beliefs and rejecting more conservative social policy", and notes that although the show makes [...] "wicked fun of conservatives", it is [...] "at the forefront of a conservative revolt against liberal media." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} at the centre of a {{controversy}} surrounding [...] "ninety-minute bigots", an expression allegedly coined by former Rangers chairman Sir David Murray: [...] "Ninety-minute Bigots do not hold beliefs but nonetheless sing songs at football matches which are sectarian, simply to join in {{with the rest of}} the crowd." [...] Rangers have adopted several measures to tackle this behaviour including attempts to bring older Rangers songs back into popular use, with Murray speaking out against the singing of the [...] "Billy Boys" [...] on many occasions. In 2006, Rangers were charged by UEFA for discriminatory chanting over the singing of [...] "Billy Boys" [...] during a UEFA Champions League game against Villarreal. Rangers were found not guilty due to [...] "Billy Boys" [...] having been sung for years without the SFA or the Scottish government intervening against it and ruled that it was tolerated as a social and historic song. However, after an appeal where they were warned, Rangers were ordered by UEFA to make a public announcement at all home games, prohibiting the singing of the song despite UEFA admitting they were unable to do anything about it because it was a Scottish social issue. In 2011, [...] "Billy Boys" [...] was included in a list of chants that had been banned from Scottish football grounds as part of new legislation from the Scottish government. It was specifically banned because of its [...] "Up to our knees in Fenian blood" [...] line. It was banned because it was decided by the Scottish government that [...] "Fenian" [...] in the context of the song meant Roman Catholics and was thus sectarian despite Rangers fans stating that it meant Irish <b>republicans</b> <b>or</b> fans of their Old Firm rivals, Celtic.|$|E
2500|$|East Tennessee {{is one of}} the few {{regions in}} the South that has {{consistently}} voted Republican since the Civil War. [...] The state's 1st and 2nd congressional districts, anchored in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville respectively, are among the few ancestrally Republican regions in the South. [...] The 1st has been held by <b>Republicans</b> <b>or</b> their predecessors without interruption since 1881, and for all but four years since 1859. [...] The 2nd has been in the hands of <b>Republicans</b> <b>or</b> their predecessors since 1855. [...] Until the 1950s, congressmen from the 1st and 2nd Districts were among the few truly senior Republican congressmen from the South. Historically, Democrats were more competitive in the Chattanooga-based 3rd district, but recent trends have made it almost as staunchly Republican as the 1st and 2nd districts.|$|E
