40|$|Aims Net primary {{productivity}} (NPP) {{is a key}} parameter in vegetation growth and terrestrial ecosystem processes and {{plays an important role}} in carbon circulation. The relationship between NPP and climate is complicated and needed additional research. Our aim was to study this relationship in different time units and scales to uncover their interaction mechanism. Methods Based on remotely-sensed estimated NPP calculated by light use efficiency model, the relationship between NPP and climatic indices (including precipitation, temperature, and effective precipitation and temperature) and three land surface humidity indices during 1982 – 2006, are assumed in Inner Mongolia. We considered land cover condition and time lag and accumulation effect of climate factors, using time lag correlation analysis, to uncover the interaction between NPP and climate. Important findings Temperature <b>related</b> <b>indices</b> correlate poorly with annual NPP, and current year precipitation affects NPP the most. With month as the time unit, intra-annual monthly climatic factors are key factors influencing vegetation growth. In all vegetation types, intra-annual monthly climate indices could affect NPP in an effective time period of one month and so do NPP to climate. At the inter-annual level, monthly precipitation and humidity index affect NPP more than temperature <b>related</b> <b>indices,</b> which reveals that precipitation is the restricted climatic factor in this area with obvious accumulation effects. Areas with different vegetation types represent various relations between inter-annual monthly NPP and climatic indices...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundN-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP) {{has emerged}} as an {{important}} marker of cardiac stress and may reflect the severity of underlying cardiac dysfunction, which {{is thought to be}} associated with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). MethodsThis study evaluated the plasma concentration of NT-ProBNP in 60 consecutive patients (median age 55. 7 years, median body mass index (BMI) 31. 8) who were referred to a sleep laboratory with a suspicion of OSAS. Each subject underwent measurement of morning NT-ProBNP plasma levels, polysomnography and echocardiography. Patients were treated with nasal continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation (nCPAP/BIPAP) or without mechanical respiratory support, depending on clinical symptoms and results of polysomnography. Three months after treatment of OSAS 28 of the patients were reassessed for re-evaluation of NT-ProBNP and polysomnography. ResultsLow or high levels of NT-proBNP were not associated with AHI and other sleep <b>related</b> <b>indices</b> (p> 0. 3). There was no correlation between NT-proBNP and AHI or other sleep <b>related</b> <b>indices.</b> In multiple regression analysis, NT-proBNP was significantly correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction, creatinine clearance and the presence of systemic arterial hypertension but not with AHI.
