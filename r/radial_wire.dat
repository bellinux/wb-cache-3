50|$|The {{airships}} skeleton {{was built}} {{of the new}} lightweight alloy duralumin 17-SRT. The frame introduced several novel features compared with traditional Zeppelin designs. Rather than being single-girder diamond trusses with <b>radial</b> <b>wire</b> bracing, the main rings of the Akron were self-supporting deep frames: triangular Warren trusses curled round to form a ring. Though much heavier than conventional rings, the deep rings promised to be much stronger, a significant attraction to the navy after the in-flight break up of the earlier conventional airships R38/ZR-2 and ZR-1 Shenandoah. The inherent strength of these frames allowed Chief Designer, Dr Karl Arnstein, to dispense with the internal cruciform structure used by Zeppelin to support the fins of their ships. Instead, the fins of the Akron were cantilevered: mounted entirely externally to the main structure. Zeppelin and other rigid designs used a single keel at the lowest point of the hull circumference but Arnstein gave the Akron three keels, one running {{along the top of}} the hull and one each side, 45 degrees up from the lower centreline. Each keel provided a walkway running almost the entire length of the ship. The strength of the main rings, the lower keels, and the fact that helium, instead of flammable hydrogen, was to be used, also allowed the designer to mount the engines inside the hull, improving streamlining.|$|E

Jet and ambient plasmas are formed during the z-pinch discharge of a 1. 4 MA, 240 ns current pulse delivered by Imperial College London's MAGPIE generator. Jets are of centimetre length and microsecond lifetime but have sufficiently large Reynolds and PÃ©clet numbers (> 10, 000) to permit well-scaled comparison with non-magnetised astrophysical jets, including the bipolar outflows of protostars. Jet densities are of order 10 e 19 particles per cubic centimetre, and density ratios (jet density/ambient density) between 1 and 10, are demonstrated. Jets are formed by ablation of micrometer thickness aluminium (Al) or tungsten (W) wires arranged in the conical or <b>radial</b> <b>wire</b> array z-pinch geometries. Ambient plasmas are formed {{during the same}} current pulse by ablation of wires in the cylindrical wire array geometry, or {{the surface of a}} 14 micrometre thickness, 40 mm diameter aluminium foil. Leading shock features launched by conical wire array jet material into foil-driven plasmas demonstrate effective adiabatic indices of 1. 4 and 1. 2 for Al/Al and W/Al interactions respectively. <b>Radial</b> <b>wire</b> arrays are observed to drive higher Mach number interactions than those of conical wire arrays, with upstream Mach numbers M > 3. 5 and M > 1. 7 respectively.

[...] A [...] "top hat" [...] of <b>radial</b> <b>wires</b> is occasionally added {{to the top of}} mast radiators, to allow the mast to be made shorter. For local broadcast stations and amateur stations of under 5 kW, T- and L-antennas are often used, which consist of one or more horizontal wires suspended between two masts, attached to a vertical radiator wire. A popular choice for lower-powered stations is the umbrella antenna, which needs only one mast one-tenth wavelength or less in height. This antenna uses a single mast insulated from ground and fed at the lower end against ground. At the top of the mast, <b>radial</b> top-load <b>wires</b> are connected (usually about six) which slope downwards at an angle of 40-45 degrees as far as about one-third of the total height, where they are terminated in insulators and thence outwards to ground anchors.

50|$|An early {{decision}} {{had been made to}} construct the primary structure largely from stainless steel rather than lightweight alloys such as duralumin. The design of the primary structure was shared between Cardington and the aircraft manufacturer Boulton and Paul, who had extensive experience in the use of steel and had developed innovative techniques for forming steel strip into structural sections. Working to an outline design prepared with the help of data supplied by the NPL, the stress calculations were performed by Cardington. This information was then supplied to J. D. North and his team at Boulton and Paul, who designed the actual metalwork. The individual girders were fabricated by Boulton and Paul in Norwich and transported to Cardington where they were bolted together. This scheme for a prefabricated structure entailed demanding manufacturing tolerances and was entirely successful, as the ease with which R101 was eventually extended bears witness. Before any contracts for the metalwork were signed, an entire bay consisting of a pair of the 15-sided transverse ring frames and the connecting longitudinal girders was assembled at Cardington. After the assembly had passed loading tests, the individual girders were then tested to destruction. The structure of the airframe was innovative: the ring-shaped transverse frames of previous airships had been braced by <b>radial</b> <b>wires</b> meeting at a central hub, but no such bracing was used in R101, the frames being stiff enough in themselves. However, this resulted in the structure extending further into the envelope, thereby limiting the size of the gasbags.|$|R
