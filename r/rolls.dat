Several {{sources for the}} actual idea of making the <b>rolls</b> as <b>rolls</b> have been suggested, including Jews, Adelard of Bath, who was a royal clerk and was familiar with Arabic practices of using <b>rolls,</b> or the royal clerk Thurkil, who studied under a mathematician {{who may have been}} from Sicily.|$|E
5|$|The Pipe <b>rolls</b> {{from the}} 13th century onwards are less {{important}} for historical study {{because there are}} other surviving financial records. Some, such as the receipt <b>rolls,</b> were also kept by the exchequer, and were used by the treasury clerks to prepare the Pipe <b>rolls.</b> Other surviving records were kept by the sheriffs for their own use in submitting accounts to the Pipe <b>rolls.</b> However the post 13th-century Pipe <b>rolls</b> are occasionally the sole source for historical facts such as William Shakespeare's residence in the parish of St Helen's Bishopsgate, and in Southwark.|$|E
5|$|The {{example of}} the royal exchequer's records {{eventually}} influenced others to keep similar records. The earliest surviving non-royal Pipe <b>rolls</b> {{are those of the}} Bishop of Winchester, which are extant from 1208, and form a continuous series from that date. They started under Peter des Roches, who was also a royal clerk and administrator. They record monies coming in as well as expenses and payments made, in detail, but like the royal records, they do not show profits or losses as a sum total. Most private <b>rolls</b> resembling the Pipe <b>rolls</b> are from monasteries. The household <b>rolls,</b> which closely resemble the Pipe <b>rolls,</b> for Eleanor of England, wife of Simon de Montfort, survive for part of the year 1265.|$|E

5|$|Yet more {{extraneous}} {{details were}} removed from the Pipe <b>rolls</b> under the Cowick Ordinance of June 1323, along with further ordinances in 1324 and 1326, all of which were done during the time that Walter de Stapledon held the office of Treasurer. Prior to this reform the <b>rolls</b> had become clogged with debts, and clauses 2 through 8 of the Cowick Ordinance attempted to return the <b>rolls</b> to an exposition of accounts. Another attempted reform at this time was the removal of customs receipts, as well as military accounts, from the <b>rolls.</b> New offices in the Exchequer were also created, in an attempt to speed up the auditing process and lessen the time it took to prepare the Pipe <b>rolls</b> and other financial records. The attempt to remove non-Exchequer accounts did completely remove those types of records from the Pipe <b>rolls,</b> and further reforms in 1368 created a set of foreign <b>rolls,</b> and all extraneous records in the Pipe <b>rolls</b> were transferred to those <b>rolls.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the one {{surviving}} roll from Henry I's reign, {{no further}} Pipe <b>rolls</b> survived from his reign, nor are any preserved from {{the reign of}} his successor, King Stephen (reigned 1135–1154).

It is unclear if Pipe <b>rolls</b> were actually created during Stephen's reign and they did not survive, or if the conditions during Stephen's reign precluded the creation of Pipe <b>rolls.</b> Continuously from the early years of King Henry II's reign, most Pipe <b>rolls</b> survive, with only a break {{in the last years of}} King John's reign (reigned 1199–1216).|$|E

5|$|Certain areas did {{not report}} their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe <b>rolls,</b> unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These {{included}} the palatinates of Durham and Chester. The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in the Pipe <b>rolls,</b> {{but it was not}} a palatinate. Another problem with using the Pipe <b>rolls</b> for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll. In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe <b>rolls</b> often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{with the}} Domesday Survey, the Pipe <b>rolls</b> {{contributed to the}} {{centralisation}} of financial records by the Norman kings (reigned 1066–1154) of England that was ahead of contemporary Western European monarchies; the French, for instance, {{did not have an}} equivalent system of accounting until the 1190s. The exact form of the records, kept in a roll instead of a book, was also unique to England, although why England kept some of its administrative records in this form is unclear. A set of Norman <b>rolls,</b> drafted differently, are extant in a few years for the reigns of Kings Henry II (reigned 1154–1189) and Richard I (reigned 1189–1199), who also ruled the Duchy of Normandy in France. It is believed that the Norman <b>rolls</b> were started {{about the same time as}} the English, but due to lack of survival of the earlier Norman <b>rolls,</b> it is unclear exactly when they did start. An Irish Exchequer produced Irish Pipe <b>rolls,</b> and much like the English Pipe <b>rolls,</b> the earliest surviving Irish Pipe roll, that of 1212, does not appear to be the first produced.|$|E

5|$|The Anthony Roll was {{originally}} {{a set of}} three separate vellum <b>rolls.</b> It exists today {{in the form of}} a bound volume containing the first and third <b>rolls</b> while the second roll is preserved in its original form. The three original <b>rolls</b> were made up out of a total of 17 individual membranes glued to the back of the next membrane. The membranes were of a width of 70cm (27 ½ inches) and a height varying from 79 to 96cm (31 to 37 ¾ inches). After receiving the first and third <b>rolls</b> Pepys had his clerks cut the <b>rolls</b> up and bound in a single volume as a book, now known as Pepys 2991. The transformation of the two <b>rolls</b> created a horizontal page structure, and some of the ornamentation that was cut in process was copied into the volume by hand. Pepys also inserted abstracts between the two <b>rolls</b> and a summarizing table that was not Anthony's, but pre-dated Pepys' binding of the <b>rolls.</b> This radical treatment of the original document has damaged some of the illustrations and is today deprecated. The first three illustrations of the Henry Grace à Dieu, Mary Rose and Peter Pomegranate were all too large to fit on one page and were therefore converted to two-page spreads. The resulting bend down the centre of the illustrations led to noticeable loss of detail. Despite this, there are no plans to attempt a recreation of the original structure of the first and third <b>rolls.</b> The second roll, British Library Additional MS 22047, is still in its original condition with the exception of a written endorsement by Mary Fox from 1857 and some damage caused by an application of chemicals to reveal faded writing.|$|E
