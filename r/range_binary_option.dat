40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we extend Buchen’s method {{to develop a}} new {{technique}} for pricing of some exotic options with several expiry dates (more than 3 expiry dates) using a concept of higher order <b>binary</b> <b>option.</b> At first we introduce the concept of higher order <b>binary</b> <b>option</b> and then provide the pricing formulae of n-th order binaries using PDE method. After that, we apply them to get the pricing of some multiple-expiry exotic options such as Bermudan option, multi time extendable option, multiple shout option and etc. Here, when calculating the price of concrete multiple-expiry exotic options, we do not try to get the formal solution to corre-sponding initial-boundary problem of the Black-Scholes equation, but explain how to express the expiry payoffs of the exotic options as a combination of the payoffs of some class of higher order <b>binary</b> <b>options.</b> Once the expiry payoffs are expressed as a linear combi-nation of the payoffs of some class of higher order <b>binary</b> <b>options,</b> in order to avoid arbitrage, the exotic option prices are obtained by static replication with respect to this family of higher order binaries. 1...|$|R
