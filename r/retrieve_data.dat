Some of these devices have volatile memory while some have non-volatile memory. Sufficient methodologies are available to <b>retrieve</b> <b>data</b> from volatile memory, however, there is lack of detailed methodology or a framework for data retrieval from non-volatile memory sources. Depending {{on the type of}} devices, media or artifacts, digital forensics investigation is branched into various types.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{growing to}} certain heights, the Star Plant grows through larger {{floating}} islands. These islands, {{along with the}} smaller ones surrounding the Star Plant, contain power-up crystals which can be collected to provide B.U.D. with extra abilities. Creatures and other plant life {{can also be found}} throughout the game's islands, as well as environmental features, such as caves and water currents. Some parts of the environment, such as leaves growing off of both the Star Plant and Star Shoots that allow the player to jump to greater heights than normally possible, can affect how the player moves throughout the world. Teleportation pads allow the player to move around the world quickly and act as save points. The player also respawns at their last activated teleportation pad if they die, which can be caused by falling long distances, being in too much water for too long, or by the player making B.U.D. self-destruct. Additionally, players can scan various flora and fauna into the teleporters to <b>retrieve</b> <b>data</b> from them. Items can be picked up by the player and stored in B.U.D.'s backpack one at a time, such as flower parachutes that make the player fall more slowly towards the ground, and leaf gliders that allow the player to travel further through the air.|$|E

25|$|XML and its {{extensions}} have regularly {{been criticized}} for verbosity and complexity. Mapping the basic tree model of XML to type systems of programming languages or databases can be difficult, especially when XML is used for exchanging highly structured data between applications, which was not its primary design goal. However, XML data binding systems allow applications to access XML data directly from objects representing a data structure of the data in the programming language used, which ensures type safety, rather than using the DOM or SAX to <b>retrieve</b> <b>data</b> from a direct representation of the XML itself. This is accomplished by automatically creating a mapping between elements of the XML schema XSD of the document and members of a class to be represented in memory. Other criticisms attempt to refute the claim that XML is a self-describing language (though the XML specification itself makes no such claim). JSON, YAML, and S-Expressions are frequently proposed as simpler alternatives (see Comparison of data serialization formats); that focus on representing highly structured data rather than documents, which may contain both highly structured and relatively unstructured content. However, W3C standardized XML schema specifications offer {{a broader range of}} structured XSD data types compared to simpler serialization formats and offer modularity and reuse through XML namespace.|$|E

It is divided in sections like the core API, the compara API (for comparative genomics data), the variation API (for accessing SNPs, SNVs, CNVs..), and the functional genomics API (to access regulatory data).|$|E
2500|$|Queries are the {{mechanisms}} that Jet uses to <b>retrieve</b> <b>data</b> from the database. They {{can be defined}} in Microsoft QBE (Query By Example), through the Microsoft Access SQL Window or through Access Basic's Data Access Objects (DAO) language. These are then converted to an SQL SELECT statement. The query is then d [...] this involves parsing the query (involves syntax checking and determining the columns to query in the database table), then converted into an internal Jet query object format, which is then tokenized and organised into a tree like structure. In Jet 3.0 onwards these are then optimised using the Microsoft Rushmore query optimisation technology. The query is then executed and the results passed back to the application or user who requested the data.|$|E

Some contest software even provide a means to control the station equipment via computer, <b>retrieve</b> <b>data</b> from the radio and send pre-recorded morse code, voice or digital messages. [...] After {{the conclusion of a}} contest, each station must submit its operational log to the contest sponsor.

The goal of this tool is to enable semantic web crawling with a user friendly interface by applying a semantic web framework API to an existing web archiving system and an easy way for reusing the data in authoring by implementing a <b>retrieved</b> <b>data</b> delivery engine. To demonstrate this new tool, this paper presents an example scenario for <b>retrieving</b> semantic <b>data</b> from a specified domain and utilizing drag and drop method in authoring.
