5000|$|BCW, <b>back</b> <b>check</b> wire {{supporting}} the <b>back</b> <b>check,</b> and screwed to the wippen. The {{purpose of the}} <b>back</b> <b>check</b> is to check the hammer by coming {{in contact with the}} [...] "back catch" [...] (the backward projection of the butt), at a short distance from the string in its return, and prevent the hammer from falling entirely back to its rest position, thereby preventing quick repetition.|$|R
5000|$|Note : There is {{a hidden}} track titled [...] "Start it" [...] before [...] "Each Time", it {{required}} to <b>read</b> <b>back</b> during 4min 27s.Because no software (PC/Mac) can <b>read</b> <b>back,</b> just Hi-Fi CD Player and Discman can find it.|$|R
50|$|Walter {{improved}} on Stein's {{design by}} {{adding to the}} action a <b>back</b> <b>check,</b> which caught the hammer on its descent, preventing it from {{bouncing up and down}} in lively playing. This innovation was generally adopted by other Viennese makers in Walter's time, and remains standard in the modern piano. Its importance is illustrated by an observation of Palmieri and Palmieri, namely that modern replicas of Stein pianos commonly include a <b>back</b> <b>check</b> even though it is not historically authentic on these instruments.|$|R

50|$|Some {{operating}} systems provide for swapping entire address spaces, {{in addition to}} whatever facilities they have for paging and segmentation. When this occurs, the OS writes those pages and segments currently in real memory to swap files. In a swap-in, the OS <b>reads</b> <b>back</b> {{the data from the}} swap files but does not automatically <b>read</b> <b>back</b> pages that had been paged out {{at the time of the}} swap out operation.|$|R

40|$|Ultrahigh storage {{densities of}} up to 1 Tbit/in. 2 can be {{achieved}} by local-probe techniques to write, <b>read</b> <b>back,</b> and erase data in very thin polymer films. The thermomechanical scanning-probe-based data-storage concept called Millipede combines ultrahigh density, terabit capacity, small form factor, and high data rate. After illustrating the principles of operation of the Millipede, we introduce a channel model for the analysis of the <b>read</b> <b>back</b> process, and compare analytical results with experimental data. 1...|$|R
