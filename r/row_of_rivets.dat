Most of the tests were made with an airfoil of 5 -foot chord. The air speed was varied from 80 to 500 miles per hour and the lift coefficient from 0 to 0. 30. The increases in the drag of the 5 -foot airfoil varied from 6 %, due to countersunk rivets, to 27 %, due to 3 / 32 -inch brazier-head rivets, with the rivets in a representative arrangement. The drag increases caused by protruding rivet heads were roughly proportional to the height of the heads. With the front <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>rivets</b> well forward, changes in spanwise pitch had negligible effects on drag unless the pitch was more than 2. 5 % of the chord. Data are presented for evaluating the drag reduction attained by removing rivets from the forward part of the wing surface; for example, it is shown that over 70 % of the rivet drag is caused by the rivets on the forward 30 % of the airfoil in a typical case...|$|E
40|$|Results of a {{fracture}} mechanics analysis relevant to fatigue crack growth at rivets in lap joints of aircraft skins are presented. Multi-site damage (MSD) is receiving increased attention {{within the context}} of problems of aging aircraft. Fracture analyses previously carried out include small-scale modeling of rivet/skin interactions, larger-scale two-dimensional models of lap joints similar to that developed here, and full scale three-dimensional models of large portions of the aircraft fuselage. Fatigue testing efforts have included flat coupon specimens, two-dimensional lap joint tests, and full scale tests on specimens designed to closely duplicate aircraft sections. Most of this work is documented in the proceedings of previous symposia on the aging aircraft problem. The effect MSD has on the ability of skin stiffeners to arrest the growth of long skin cracks is a particularly important topic that remains to be addressed. One of the most striking features of MSD observed in joints of some test sections and in the joints of some of the older aircraft fuselages is the relative uniformity of the fatigue cracks from rivet to rivet along an extended <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>rivets.</b> This regularity suggests that nucleation of the cracks must not be overly difficult. Moreover, it indicates that there is some mechanism which keeps longer cracks from running away from shorter ones, or, equivalently, a mechanism for shorter cracks to catch-up with longer cracks. This basic mechanism has not been identified, and one of the objectives of the work is to see to what extent the mechanism is revealed by {{a fracture}} analysis of the MSD cracks. Another related aim is to present accurate stress intensity factor variations with crack length which can be used to estimate fatigue crack growth lifetimes once cracks have been initiated. Results are presented which illustrate the influence of load shedding from rivets with long cracks to neighboring rivets with shorter cracks. Results are also included for the effect of residual stress due to the riveting process itself...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, a new {{analytical}} {{technique to}} study the effect of wide-spread fatigue damage in ductile panels is presented. The main {{purpose of the study}} is to develop an efficient methodology to predict he maximum load carrying capacity of panels with cracks. The problem arises especially in the fuselage skin of aging airplanes, in which cracks initiate from a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>rivet</b> holes. This problem is known as Multi Site Damage (MSD) in aging aircraft. It is very important to estimate the load carrying capacity. Usually, the approach based on elastic fracture mechanics may overestimate the load capacity. It is very important for the aircraft structure with MSD to estimate the load carrying capacity of such damaged structures. Approaches based on elastic fracture mechanics often lead to a considerable error. In this paper, the Elastic Finite Element Alternating Method (EFEAM) has been extended to the case of elastic-plastic fracture of panels with MSD cracks. In EFEAM, analytical solutions to crack problems in an infinite plate are employed. In this study, we adopted an analytical solution for a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> cracks in an infinite panel. Furthermore, the plastic deformation is accounted for, by using the initial stress algorithm. The T * integral is employed for the fracture criterion. The methodology developed in the present study can be called as Elastic-Plastic Finite Element Alternating Method (EPFEAM) for MSD problems. A series of studies on the maximum load capacity of panels with a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> cracks has been conducted. ...|$|R

40|$|Multiple site damage (MSD) is the {{occurrence}} of many small cracks at multiple locations such as rivet holes. Once the MSD is initiated, the strength of structure may be quickly reduced to an unacceptable level and caused catastrophic failure. ^ This dissertation describes research into the fatigue life of lap joint structure with MSD. The load transfer mechanism in joint structure is studied, including several types <b>of</b> <b>rivets,</b> material properties and structure geometry. The load transfer for each rivet is determined {{as a function of}} crack propagation. Two other mechanisms can affect the load transfer mechanism-interference between the rivet and rivet hole due to riveting process, and clamping pressure between the panels, were also investigated. Since these two mechanisms are complicated to analyze, and rely {{on the quality of the}} manufacture and assembly, the riveting process was well controlled by applying the rivet squeeze force through an MTS machine. ^ Single lap joint specimens, containing fatigue MSD in one <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>rivet</b> holes, were cycled to failure under constant amplitude loading. A modified MSD life prediction model is used to estimate fatigue life. Predictions for the growth and coalescence of individual cracks are in accordance with the experimental results. During the fatigue tests, the propagation of some small cracks at low remote stress levels were delayed due to clamping-up stress under the countersink rivet head. Marker band analysis, therefore, is utilized to detect the crack growth information under countersink rivet head and includes the delay effect into the fatigue prediction program. ^ The individual/relative effect of two random variablesâ€”the interference fit levels and crack length distribution at rivet holesâ€”on MSD fatigue life is investigated. A thousand Monte Carlo simulations are performed to determine the statistical degradation in residual strength as the Wide Fatigue Damage (WFD) extends by fatigue. The fastener interference, reflected as riveting quality, determines the overall evaluation of fatigue behavior of a lap joint. The influence <b>of</b> both <b>rivet</b> installation (i. e. fastener interference) and initial WFD size on fatigue life and residual strength are presented, and indicate the relative influence of these parameters on structural integrity. ...|$|R

5000|$|Historically, in Europe, {{from the}} pre-Roman period on, the rings {{composing}} {{a piece of}} mail would be riveted closed to reduce the chance of the rings splitting open when subjected to a thrusting attack or a hit by an arrow. Up until the 14th century European mail was made <b>of</b> alternating <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> round <b>riveted</b> rings and solid rings. Sometime during the 14th century European mail makers started to transition from round rivets to wedge shaped rivets but continued using alternating <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> solid rings. Eventually European mail makers stopped using solid rings and almost all European mail was made from wedge riveted rings only with no solid rings. Both were commonly made of wrought iron, but some later pieces were made of heat-treated steel. Wire for the riveted rings was formed by either of two methods. One was to hammer out wrought iron into plates and cut or slit the plates. These thin pieces were then pulled through a draw plate repeatedly until the desired diameter was achieved. Waterwheel powered drawing mills are pictured in several period manuscripts. Another method was to simply forge down an iron billet into a rod and then proceed to draw it out into wire. The solid links would {{have been made by}} punching from a sheet. Guild marks were often stamped on the rings to show their origin and craftsmanship. Forge welding was also used to create solid links, but there are few possible examples known; the only well documented example from Europe is that of the camail (mail neck-defence) of the 7th century Coppergate helmet. Outside of Europe this practice was more common such as [...] "theta" [...] links from India. Very few examples of historic butted mail have been found and it is generally accepted that butted mail was never in wide use historically except in Japan where mail (kusari) was commonly made from butted links.|$|R
