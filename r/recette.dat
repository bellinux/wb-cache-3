It lies among the {{drooping}} trees of a little island in the Seine, called the Isle de la <b>Recette,</b> and you may find it by taking the suburban tramway for Asnières. It has little tombstones, monuments, and flowered walks. One sorrow-stricken master has inscribed over a dog's grave,--"Plus je vois les hommes, plus j'aime mon chien." [...] The most notable feature of the cemetery is the monument of Barry, a St. Bernard dog. The inscription states that he saved forty lives in the Alps.|$|E

5000|$|Recettear {{takes place}} in a fantasy setting, and places the player in the role of <b>Recette</b> Lemongrass, the {{daughter}} of a shopkeeper who has left to be an adventurer but has mysteriously disappeared. As her father was in great debt to Terme Finance, she is forced by Terme's representative fairy, Tear, to rebuild her home into an item shop to repay the debt. <b>Recette</b> reopens the shop as Recettear, a portmanteau of hers and Tear's names, though also a pun on the word [...] "racketeer". As such, <b>Recette</b> adopts the catchphrase [...] "Capitalism, ho!" [...] as the player continues on with the story. The game's story is presented through text dialog and two-dimensional sprites, akin to a visual novel. There are some occasional spoken lines in Japanese, which remain untranslated in the English version.|$|E

5000|$|Recettear: An Item Shop’s Tale (Recettear: How to Start an Item Shop) is a {{role-playing}} game {{developed by}} Japanese dōjin maker EasyGameStation for the Windows operating system. The game follows {{a young girl}} named <b>Recette,</b> who is charged by the fairy Tear to run an item shop {{out of her house}} to pay off the considerable debt her father had accumulated before his mysterious disappearance; the eponymous shop is a portmanteau of the lead characters' names but also a pun on the word [...] "racketeer". In the game, the player controls <b>Recette</b> in several areas of gameplay, including bargaining and haggling with clients for goods, and accompanying an adventurer into randomly generated dungeons to acquire goods to sell, with the goal of paying back the debt within a fixed deadline.|$|E

50|$|When adventuring, {{the player}} {{recruits}} {{a member of}} the local adventure guild. The player has access to only one adventurer {{at the start of the}} game, but as the game progresses, new guild members with various skills and abilities can be accessed. Through Tear's magic, <b>Recette</b> is invulnerable in the dungeon but cannot interact with the creatures within it, and instead watches over the adventurer, helping to collect items dropped by creatures or supplying healing items. The player has a limited amount of storage they can carry from the dungeon, and should the adventurer fall and cannot be healed, the player must drop most of their inventory to allow <b>Recette</b> to carry the adventurer out of the dungeon. Each dungeon features a number of randomly generated dungeon levels, along with a final treasure room at a specific depth. Items found in dungeons can be used as equipment for the adventurer, sold at the shop, or combined with other items to make more useful and valuable goods. The adventurer gains experience points and gains levels as he or she kills monsters, making the character more effective in deeper dungeons.|$|E
50|$|Philip had no {{fixed capital}} {{and moved the}} court between various palaces, the main urban ones being Brussels, Bruges, and Lille. He held grand feasts and other festivities, and the knights of his Order {{frequently}} travelled throughout his territory to participate in tournaments. In 1454, Philip planned a crusade against the Ottoman Empire, launching it at the Feast of the Pheasant, but this plan never materialized. In a period from 1444 to 1446, he is estimated to have spent a sum equivalent to 2% of Burgundy's main tax income in the <b>recette</b> génerale, with a single Italian supplier of silk and cloth of gold, Giovanni di Arrigo Arnolfini.|$|E
50|$|When {{the player}} chooses {{to operate the}} shop, they can place items on the shop's shelves, with certain spots, such as near the {{storefront}} window, being more lucrative to draw in buyers. When a potential buyer selects an item, the player can bargain {{to try to get}} as much profit from the sale as possible, but ineffectively bargaining will cause the buyer to leave without purchasing anything. Successful bargains earn points towards the player's merchant level, allowing for improvement of the shop and selling benefits once higher levels are gained. Customers may also bring goods to sell to <b>Recette,</b> requiring the player to try to barter and buy the item well below cost.|$|E

50|$|Even today, {{the castle}} appears as an {{imposing}} fortress. The two high round towers {{are covered by}} a single roof which also covers the central passage. Openings for cannons are visible. Of the inner curtain, a fragment of the north wall survives along with the covered round walk, terminating to the east with a semi-cylindrical tower. In the south east, the gateway is framed by round towers. Above the gate is the Saint-Ymas church with its single nave of four bays. To the south, demolished in the 18th century, stood the keep composed of two towers. In the north west, between two towers, a double-gabled building has been nicknamed pavillon de la <b>recette.</b> A tennis court and a well are close by. A second well supplied the keep. Ditches surrounded each of the curtain walls.|$|E
5000|$|Should {{the player}} miss the debt payment deadline, <b>Recette</b> {{is forced to}} sell the shop and live in a {{cardboard}} box; the player can choose to restart the game retaining their merchant level and items, but not pix amount. Successfully completing the game unlocks three further game modes: [...] "New Game+" [...] which restarts the game but allows the player to keep their items and merchant and adventure levels from the completed game, [...] "Endless Mode" [...] where the player can continue the game indefinitely without having to pay any debt, and [...] "Survival Mode", where the player must try to complete ever-increasing debt payments on a weekly basis. Survival Mode offers two versions, Normal Survival, where the items and levels are retained week to week, and Survival Hell, where these do not carry onward.|$|E
