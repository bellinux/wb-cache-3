50|$|The Mamiya Press {{is a line}} of medium-format {{rangefinder}} system camera {{manufactured by}} Mamiya. The first model was introduced in 1960, and the final model was discontinued in the 1970s. It was targeted at the professional press photography market, and {{a wide array of}} accessories was offered. The maximum image size that can be captured is 6 cm × 9 cm, but images can be taken {{in a number of different}} formats, and using several types of film. All of the lenses have leaf shutters, which are released on the lens itself, not through the body as is typical with most cameras. The shutter is typically triggered from one of several models of removable grips, all of which have a built-in <b>release</b> <b>cable.</b> The lenses also have flash sync terminals. The camera lacks an internal dark slide, so one has to be inserted into the film holder before changing the lens.|$|E

50|$|On {{passenger}} cars, a hood may be {{held down}} by a concealed latch. It is designed to protect a car from thefts, damage and sudden hood opening on the road. The hood release system is common on the most of vehicles and usually consists of interior hood latch handle, hood <b>release</b> <b>cable</b> and hood latch assembly. The hood latch handle is usually located below the steering wheel, beside the driver's seat or set into the door frame. When a driver pulls a hood latch handle the hood panel pops up and allows access to the engine compartment. On race cars or cars with aftermarket hoods (that do not use the factory latch system) the hood may be held down by hood pins. A hood may sometimes contain a hood ornament, hood scoop, power bulge, and/or wiper jets. Hoods are typically made out of steel, but aluminum is rapidly gaining popularity with auto companies. Aftermarket manufacturers may construct hoods out of fiberglass, carbon fiber, or dry carbon.|$|E
50|$|The {{expectation}} of {{the appearance of}} DCAS as a possible future technology {{was used as a}} reason that the FCC should <b>release</b> <b>cable</b> companies from obligations regarding CableCARDs. Verizon FiOS wished to be released from having to support CableCARDs at all on its network. Cable companies point to DCAS as a reason that they should be released from their obligation to use CableCARDs in their devices, as the FCC directed in 1998. The Consumer Electronics Association representing major consumer electronics manufacturers disagreed with these applications for waivers pointing to the insubstantiality of the proposal and that cable companies are notoriously late and half-hearted in their support of their own standards, as evidenced by their behavior with their earlier CableCARD proposal. Detractors of DCAS point out that the proposal is being used to sow fear, uncertainty, and doubt in the minds of consumers, CE companies, and the FCC. Consumers are motivated to hold off buying CableCARD devices, CE companies are wondering whether their CableCARD technology investments will soon be obsolete, and it causes doubt amongst FCC regulators whether they should enforce deadlines and restrictions placed on cable companies regarding CableCARDs. Detractors point to this as the latest in a decade-long set of delaying tactics that the cable company has used to avoid compliance with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Cable companies counter that CableCARD devices have failed in the marketplace {{and that it would be}} foolish for them to be forced to use CableCARDs when the superior technology of DCAS will soon be available.|$|E
40|$|A {{major problem}} in {{telecommunications}} is to adapt the information to be transmitted to the propagation channel. This, {{in order to obtain}} a good quality of wireless communications with high transmission rates, and the <b>release</b> <b>cable</b> users to allow them to move in large buildings. In this type of communication systems must be properly fight one effect of multipath, specifically the frequency selective fading. This led to the development and use of the technique of multiplexing by orthogonal frequency division (OFDM) appears to be a promising solution. For frequency-selective channels, a technique is the use of multi-carrier modulation in which a block of information is modulated by a Fourier transform. This known as OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) technique has been very successful in recent years and {{is in the process of}} standardization in different standards without son (IEEE 802. 11 a, WiMAX, LTE, and DVB). OFDM has the great merit to transform broadband multi-path channel into a set of simple to equalize sub channels single-path. Moreover, the ingenious utilization of the transmission cyclic redundancy reduces the complexity of the terminals through the use of algorithms based on FFT fast. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the OFDM modulation. The general principles are described (transmission chain [...] .) and benefits (simplicity of the equalization algorithms use fast FFT) and disadvantages (lack of diversity) ...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a photogrammetric approach {{used to determine}} the rheological properties of active lava flows based on stereo image sequences. Bulk rheological properties can be estimated from measurements of flow slope, velocity and dimensions and so, at flow-fronts, they can be calculated from sequential digital elevation models (DEMs) acquired as the flow advances over new ground. For useful flow parameters to be extracted, DEMs may need to be obtained at approximately minute intervals, over durations of up to multiple hours. To deliver such data, we use oblique stereo pair sequences captured by digital SLR cameras and a semi-automated DEM-generation pipeline. Although similar data could be acquired with a terrestrial laser scanner, with deployments in remote and hazardous regions the photogrammetric approach offers significant logistical advantages in terms of reduced equipment cost, bulk, weight and power requirements. We describe the application of the technique to an active lava flow on Mount Etna, Sicily, in 2006. Image sequences were acquired from two tripod-mounted cameras over a period of ~ 3 hours, as the flow-front advanced ~ 15 m. Photogrammetric control was provided by 11 targets placed in the scene, with their coordinates determined by dGPS. The cameras were synchronised by a shutter <b>release</b> <b>cable</b> and triggered by an external timer (intervalometer). Image pairs were obtained every minute with DEMs extraction carried out on every fourth epoch; 57 DEMs, with a 0. 25 -m resolution, were generated. We describe the challenges associated with data collection in this remote environment and the techniques required to automate the photogrammetric analysis and sequence-DEM generation...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} correct balance {{disturbances}} {{is essential for}} maintaining upright stability. Recent literature highlights a potentially important role for the cerebral cortex in controlling compensatory balance reactions. The objective {{of this research was}} to provide a more detailed understanding of the specific neurophysiologic events occurring at the cortex following balance disturbances. More specifically, the focus was to determine whether the N 1, a cortical potential evoked during balance control, and the error-related negativity (ERN), a cortical potential measured in response to errors during cognitive tasks, have similar cortical representation, revealing a similar link to an error detection mechanism. It was hypothesized that the N 1 and ERN would have the same generator located in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Fourteen healthy young adults participated in a balance task (evoked N 1) and a flanker task (evoked ERN). Temporally unpredictable perturbations to standing balance were achieved using a lean and <b>release</b> <b>cable</b> system. Electromyography and centre of pressure were measured during the balance task. Reaction times and error rates were measured during the flanker task. Electroencephalography was recorded during both tasks. Source localization was performed in CURRY 6 using a single fixed coherent dipole model to determine the neural generator of the N 1 and ERN. The results revealed that the locations of the N 1 and ERN dipoles were different. The mean (n= 9) distance between N 1 and ERN dipoles was 25. 46 ± 8. 88 mm. The mean Talairach coordinates for the ERN dipole were (6. 47 ± 3. 08, - 4. 41 ± 13. 15, 41. 17 ± 11. 63) mm, corresponding to the cingulate gyrus (Brodmann area 24). This represents the ACC, supporting results from previous literature. The mean Talairach coordinates for the N 1 dipole were (5. 74 ± 3. 77, - 11. 81 ± 10. 84, 53. 73 ± 7. 30) mm, corresponding to the medial frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 6). This is the first work to localize the source of the N 1. It is speculated that the generator of the N 1 is the supplementary motor area and that it represents the generation of a contingency motor plan to shape the later phases of the compensatory balance response based on sensory feedback from the perturbation...|$|E
40|$|The {{capabilities}} of three on-load and one off-load release mechanisms were investigated for normal, extreme and failure type release {{operations at the}} Institute for Ocean Technology. The failure of release mechanisms during maintenance and exercise drills is a well-documented occurrence. However, until very recently the possible causes of the failures have only been postulated but never tested in a systematic way. The current study aims for {{a better understanding of}} the operational performance of lifeboat release mechanisms with respect to normal, extreme and failure operational situations. Three twin fall davit on-load release mechanisms and one off-load release mechanism were tested in the experimental study. All the release mechanism design types are fully certified by the regulatory bodies. Of the three on-load release mechanisms, two were of older existing design types while the third was of a newer (next generation) design. Of the four release mechanisms tested, two of the mechanisms were new and never used outside of this study. Also, one of the never used new mechanisms was of an older design while the other was the next generation design. The never used mechanisms had a loading capacity of 6 tonnes, while the third on-load release mechanism had been in operation for some time and had a capacity of 3 tonnes. The off-load mechanism had also been in use and had a capacity of 12 tonnes. The experiments were conducted in the material testing facility of the Institute for Ocean Technology of the National Research Council of Canada and encompassed the following tests: Inline/offline on-load tests Inline/offline static tests Offline cyclic loading Offline damage <b>release</b> <b>cable</b> Inline off-load tests Results for the above mentioned tests will be presented in this report. Thus far all the results from in-line to offline, and from dynamic to static indicate that hook C, the next generation design, appears to have a higher degree of stability than the other two sample hooks. The off-load release mechanism was limited to inline tests and followed a different testing procedure as the on-load mechanisms. The off-load release mechanism worked as intended in the limited test conditions. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
