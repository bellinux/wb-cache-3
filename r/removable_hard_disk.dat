Background on the experimental setup and procedures is provided along with several samples of data obtained from the 3 -D PIV system and an assessment of experimental uncertainty is provided. Data collected in this study include 3 -dimensional velocity-field descriptions of the flow in all four inlet jets and the entire lower plenum with inlet jet Reynolds numbers (ReJet) of approximately 4300 and 12, 400. These investigations have generated over 2 terabytes of data that has been processed to describe the various velocity components in formats suitable for external release and archived on <b>removable</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disks.</b> The processed data from both experimental studies are available in multi-column text format...|$|R
40|$|A handheld, programmable, {{digital camera}} is {{disclosed}} that supports {{a variety of}} sensors and has program control over the system components to provide versatility. The camera uses a high performance design which produces near film quality images from an electronic system. The optical system of the camera incorporates a conventional camera body that was slightly modified, thus permitting the use of conventional camera accessories, such as telephoto lenses, wide-angle lenses, auto-focusing circuitry, auto-exposure circuitry, flash units, and the like. An image sensor, such as a charge coupled device ('CCD') collects the photons that pass through the camera aperture when the shutter is opened, and produces an analog electrical signal indicative of the image. The analog image signal is read out of the CCD and is processed by preamplifier circuitry, a correlated double sampler, and a sample and hold circuit before it is converted to a digital signal. The analog-to-digital converter has an accuracy of eight bits to insure accuracy during the conversion. Two types of data ports are included for two different data transfer needs. One data port comprises a general purpose industrial standard port {{and the other a}} high speed/high performance application specific port. The system uses <b>removable</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disks</b> as its permanent storage media. The <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> receives the digital image signal from the memory buffer and correlates the image signal with other sensed parameters, such as longitudinal or other information. When the storage capacity of the <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> has been filled, the disk can be replaced with a new disk...|$|R

50|$|In modern {{personal}} computers, most {{secondary and}} tertiary storage media {{are also used}} for off-line storage. Optical discs and flash memory devices are most popular, and to much lesser extent <b>removable</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drives. In enterprise uses, magnetic tape is predominant. Older examples are floppy disks, Zip disks, or punched cards.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Kalok also {{designed}} hard disks for TEAC who used them {{as part of}} a <b>removable</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive system, which was also sold under the Kalok name. After Kalok failed in 1994, JT Storage (JTS) hired its founder as their chief technical officer, and licensed the patents involved from TEAC and Pont Peripherals.|$|E
30|$|By the mid- 1980 s mini-computers were {{starting}} to appear in nuclear medicine departments interfaced to the gamma cameras. These were physically large (in footprint) such as the Digital Equipment Corporation's PDP- 11 (Maynard, MA, USA) with large <b>removable</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disks</b> of 1 -MB capacity. In spite {{of the limitations of}} the instrumentation for imaging at the time, we commenced a programme to develop SPECT quantification believing this to be a highly desirable characteristic for a cross-sectional radionuclide imaging technology. This aim has recently been achieved and commercial SPECT systems, designed to be quantitative, are beginning to appear [2]. And to think, it has only taken around 30  years, or one generation! Interestingly, our ‘noble aim’ to develop quantitative measurements in vivo with SPECT serendipitously lead us into developing a form of simultaneous ‘hybrid imaging’[*], meaning, acquiring multiple types of data (e.g. morphological and functional) in a single scanning session, which my medical colleagues at the time in the mid- 1980 s recognised as beneficial for adding crude anatomical localisation to SPECT. This resulted in novel applications such as in verifying the positioning of intra-arterial catheters for advanced chemotherapy treatments [3] and for imaging the distribution of aerosols of different sizes in the airways [4].|$|R
5000|$|The Datapoint 2200 had a {{built-in}} full-travel keyboard, {{a built-in}} 12-line, 80-column green screen monitor, and two 47 character-per-inch cassette tape drives each with 130 kB capacity. Its size, 9+5/8 x 18+1/2 x 19+5/8 in, and shape - {{a box with}} protruding keyboard - approximated that of an IBM Selectric typewriter. Initially, a Diablo 2.5 MB 2315-type <b>removable</b> cartridge <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive was available, along with modems, several types of serial interface, parallel interface, printers and a punched card reader. Later, an 8-inch floppy disk drive was also made available, along with other, larger <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drives. An industry-compatible 7/9-track (user selectable) magnetic tape drive was available by 1975. In late 1977, Datapoint introduced ARCnet local area networking. The original Type 1 2200 shipped with 2 kilobytes of serial shift register main memory, expandable to 8K. The Type 2 2200 used denser 1 kbit RAM chips, giving it a default 4K of memory, expandable to 16K. Its starting price was around US $5,000 (...) , and a full 16K Type 2 2200 had a list price of just over $14,000.|$|R
50|$|As <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> {{capacities}} and computer CPU speeds increased {{at the end}} of the 1990s, <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> recording became more popular. As of early 2005 <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> recording takes two forms. One is the use of standard desktop or laptop computers, with adapters for encoding audio into two or many tracks of digital audio. These adapters can either be in-the-box soundcards or external devices, either connecting to in-box interface cards or connecting to the computer via USB or Firewire cables. The other common form of <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> recording uses a dedicated recorder which contains analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters as well as one or two <b>removable</b> <b>hard</b> drives for data storage. Such recorders, packing 24 tracks in a few units of rack space, are actually single-purpose computers, which can in turn be connected to standard computers for editing.|$|R
50|$|The {{flight was}} the first to test an {{electronic}} still camera in space, a modified Nikon F4.

5000|$|DVD-burning {{software}} may not {{be required}} — discs can be used and accessed like a <b>removable</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk.</b> Mac OS (8.6 or later) uses DVD-RAM directly.

50|$|Since it {{was deemed}} that no user would {{ever want to}} operate a {{computer}} without at least one floppy <b>disk</b> drive, the <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> controller was only configured to operate a single internal <b>hard</b> <b>disk.</b> An external <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> expansion port was available, but compatible external <b>hard</b> <b>disks</b> were never produced.|$|R
50|$|Cromemco {{developed}} a special {{version of the}} CS-200 computer (called the CS-250) {{to meet the requirements}} of the Air Force's Mission Support System (MSS).

50|$|While {{they are}} less common now than they once were, it is also {{possible}} to purchase a drive chassis and mount that will convert a 3.5-inch hard drive into a <b>removable</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> that can be plugged into and removed from a mounting bracket permanently installed in a desktop PC case. The mounting bracket carries the data bus and power connections over a proprietary connector, and converts back into the drive's native data bus format and power connections inside the drive's chassis.|$|E
5000|$|To {{allow for}} {{a high degree of}} {{compatibility}} with existing SCSI host adapters, Floptical drives were designed to work as a standard floppy disk drive, and not as a <b>removable</b> <b>hard</b> <b>disk.</b> To ensure this, a [...] "write lockout" [...] feature was added in the firmware. This effectively inhibits writing (including any kind of formatting) of the media. It is possible to unlock the drive by issuing a SCSI Mode Sense Command, 1A 00 20 02 A0. It is unclear how much of a problem this is, and Insite also issued EPROMs where this [...] "feature" [...] was not present.|$|E
50|$|Usually server <b>hard</b> <b>disks</b> are {{specified}} {{for less}} spinup cycles than desktop <b>hard</b> <b>disks,</b> because servers are only very rarely rebooted. On the other hand, server <b>hard</b> <b>disks</b> have much higher MTBF.|$|R
