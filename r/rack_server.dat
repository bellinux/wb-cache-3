The blade enclosure, which can hold multiple blade servers, provides power, cooling, various interconnects and additional systems management capabilities. Unlike a tower or <b>rack</b> <b>server,</b> a blade server cannot run by itself; it requires a compatible blade enclosure.|$|E

5000|$|He has coauthored several {{papers with}} Gordon Bell, {{one of the}} world’s premier {{computer}} designers, arguing how Amdahl's law {{can be used to}} revisit data-intensive computing architectures from first principles. Applying these ideas, he built a low power system, GrayWulf, using Atom processors with extremely good IO performance per unit power (factor of 15 better than a typical <b>rack</b> <b>server).</b> GrayWulf was named in homage to and builds on the work of Szalay’s collaborator legendary Microsoft computer scientist Jim Gray and Beowulf, the “original computer cluster developed at NASA using ‘off-the-shelf’ computer hardware.” Szalay led the team that won the Supercomputing Data Challenge in SC-08 - the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis - with their entry [...] "Storage Challenge GrayWulf: Scalable Clustered Architecture for Data-Intensive Computing." [...] In 2010, Szalay began developing the Data-Scope, a 6.5PB system with 500Gbytes/s sequential throughput, utilizing a uniquely balanced system built out of hard disks, SSDs and GPUs, for maximal data flow across the system. The Data-Scope went online in 2013 and read “data 30 times faster than GrayWulf, making it the fastest data-processing system at any university in the world.” ...|$|E
30|$|The {{performance}} of the coincidence processor was evaluated using a Dell PowerEdge R 730 <b>rack</b> <b>server</b> with dual Intel Xeon E 5 - 2650 v 4 CPUs. All data were stored in an Intel 750 series Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe)-attached solid state drive (SSD) (model SSDPEDMW 012 T 4 X 1). The program execution time was measured using the C++ class std::chrono::steady_clock provided in C++ 11.

40|$|Fortlax is an {{air-cooled}} {{data center}} in Norrbotten. The potential of future investments in data centers is prosperous, but sustainability is {{an increasingly important}} factor. It is important {{to make sure that}} the data centers are sufficiently cooled while too much forced cooling leads to economical losses and a waste of energy. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a CFD model of a server room at Fortlax data center that accurately predicts the temperature and flow field. The goal is to develop the CFD model in order to evaluate different cooling systems and also improve the placement of the <b>server</b> <b>racks.</b> Most of the <b>server</b> <b>racks</b> are only half full at the moment, but the heat load is supposed to increase in the near future. Therefore, it has been assumed that all the <b>server</b> <b>racks</b> generate full heat load. The commercial CFD software ANSYS CFX 16. 0 has been used to perform the simulations. The current cooling system with the current placement of the <b>server</b> <b>racks</b> resulted in some insufficiently cooled <b>server</b> <b>racks.</b> The performance of the cooling system was significantly improved when the hard-floor configuration was replaced by a raised-floor configuration. The design strategy based on hot/cold-aisles has become the standard when raised-floor configurations are used. However, the raised-floor configuration with parallel rows of <b>server</b> <b>racks</b> turned out to be the setup that performed best based on the performance metrics that were used to evaluate the results in this thesis...|$|R
