40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to take a closer look at the Seventh <b>Accession</b> <b>Treaty</b> and the terms of {{membership}} it provides for. The starting point is an overview of the structure, the rules on entry into force, the legal character of the Seventh <b>Accession</b> <b>Treaty</b> as well as the accession of Croatia to the Founding Treaties forming the core of EU’s primary law and some of their most recent modifications. This section is followed by analysis of the institutional provisions facilitating the phasing in of the Croatian authorities into the EU decision making machinery. It is important to take a look at both - the institutional framework for the period between the signature of the <b>Accession</b> <b>Treaty</b> and following its entry into force. This will lead to the analysis of immediate effect of EU law and threats to the effective application of EU law after the accession. Adaptations to the existing EU acquis and transitional periods are analysed in turn. In the last part of the article the pre and post-accession conditionality is elaborated on, furthermore the safeguard clauses laid down in the <b>Accession</b> <b>Treaty</b> are discussed in detail...|$|R

50|$|In September 2011, the Czech {{government}} formally {{submitted a}} request to the Council that the promised treaty revisions be made to extend the protocol to the Czech Republic, and a draft amendment to this effect was proposed by the European Council. However, the Czech Senate passed a resolution in October 2011 opposing their accession to the protocol. When Croatia's <b>Treaty</b> of <b>Accession</b> 2011 was signed in late 2011, the Czech protocol amendment was not included. During the Czech Republic's parliamentary ratification of the <b>accession</b> <b>treaty</b> {{in the spring of}} 2012, the government attempted to combine the approval of the Charter opt-out with the ratification bill. However, with the Senate controlled by the opposition parties, their objections to the opt-out could have led to the <b>accession</b> <b>treaty</b> being rejected. As a result, the government decided to separate the proposed opt-out from the <b>accession</b> <b>treaty</b> bill.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, {{it is argued}} that (1) the <b>Accession</b> <b>Treaties</b> have been used in {{accordance}} with their nature and proclaimed objective: they only brought about limited changes to primary law, proper to the needs of accession and have not introduced any fundamental changes. The numerous and still growing arrangements that depart from the principle of the application of the acquis in toto on accession do not alter this conclusion. (2) The evolution, especially from the 2004 <b>Accession</b> <b>Treaty</b> onwards and predictable for the future <b>Accession</b> <b>Treaties</b> (e. g. with Turkey), shows a tendency of diversification of that legal instrument by (a) adding new and/or reinforced elements of conditionality, protracted from the pre-accession phase to the membership phase, devising new mechanisms of conditionality and control (general and specific safeguard clauses, monitoring and verification mechanisms, membership postponement clause) and thus (b) contributing to a further differentiation in two respects - as among the Member States and with regard to the core acquis. Such differentiation exists already {{on the basis of the}} constitutive treaties (“in-built constitutive treaties induced differentiation”) and is accentuated by the <b>Accession</b> <b>Treaties</b> and their transitional arrangements (“Accession Treaties induced differentiation”). Questions of differentiation acquired another dimension with the introduction of the citizenship of the EU. (3) Finally, negotiations with certain candidate countries will show whether additional innovations are to be expected: a) whether future instruments of accession would be used in order to increase the existing level of differentiation (and protract the pre-accession phase logic well into the membership phase) with the conditionality becoming the most important element of the relations within an enlarged EU and thus paradoxically negating the nature of the integration itself, b) whether they will perhaps be used to bring about more important modifications to the treaties, or c) whether they will go as far as to provide a legal basis for permanent derogations with regard to certain new Member States (as explicitly envisaged, for instance, in the negotiating framework for Turkey) ...|$|R
