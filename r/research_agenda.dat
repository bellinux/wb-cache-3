He worked for Hewitt Crane on magnetic devices and miniaturization of electronics; Engelbart and Crane became close friends. At SRI, Engelbart soon obtained a dozen patents, and by 1962 produced a report about his vision and proposed <b>research</b> <b>agenda</b> titled Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework.

500|$|Lynn Hankinson Nelson {{notes that}} feminist empiricists find {{fundamental}} {{differences between the}} experiences of men and women. Thus, they seek to obtain knowledge through {{the examination of the}} experiences of women, and to [...] "uncover the consequences of omitting, misdescribing, or devaluing them" [...] to account for a range of human experience. Another part of the feminist <b>research</b> <b>agenda</b> is the uncovering of ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in society and in scientific and academic institutions. Furthermore, despite calls for greater attention to be paid to structures of gender inequity in the academic literature, structural analyses of gender bias rarely appear in highly cited psychological journals, especially in the commonly studied areas of psychology and personality.|$|E

[...] Some feminists, such as Ruth Hubbard and Evelyn Fox Keller, criticize traditional scientific discourse as being historically biased towards a male perspective. A part of the feminist <b>research</b> <b>agenda</b> is {{the examination of the}} ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in scientific and academic institutions. Physicist Lisa Randall, appointed to a task force at Harvard by then-president Lawrence Summers after his controversial discussion of why women may be underrepresented in science and engineering, said, [...] "I just want to see a whole bunch more women enter the field so these issues don't have to come up anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Linguistic {{relativity}} {{studies have}} experienced a resurgence since the 1990s, {{and a series of}} favorable experimental results have brought Whorfianism back into favor, especially in cultural psychology and linguistic anthropology. The first study directing positive attention towards Whorf's relativist position was George Lakoff's [...] "Women, Fire and Dangerous Things", in which he argued that Whorf had been on the right track in his focus on differences in grammatical and lexical categories as a source of differences in conceptualization. In 1992 psychologist John A. Lucy published two books on the topic, one analyzing the intellectual genealogy of the hypothesis, arguing that previous studies had failed to appreciate the subtleties of Whorf's thinking; they had been unable to formulate a <b>research</b> <b>agenda</b> that would actually test Whorf's claims. Lucy proposed a new research design so that the hypothesis of linguistic relativity could be tested empirically, and to avoid the pitfalls of earlier studies which Lucy claimed had tended to presuppose the universality of the categories they were studying. His second book was an empirical study of the relation between grammatical categories and cognition in the Yucatec Maya language of Mexico.|$|E

Understanding biases {{in the primary}} <b>research</b> <b>agendas</b> can assist in improving policy. Research and management are {{considered part of the}} production chain needed to manage the sustainable output of the ecosystem. We identify how economic incentives may systematically vary across research interests that feed into policy decisions over natural resource management of a simultaneously profitable and invasive species. We empirically test how this variation in incentives might affect <b>research</b> <b>agendas</b> and their findings for the case of the ongoing Red King Crab invasion in the Barents Sea. We find that <b>research</b> <b>agendas</b> may shift over time in response to shifts in the relative trade-offs between the financial resource benefit and the ecological consequences of the invasion as it progresses from introduction to establishment. Scientific con-sensus may be more difficult to achieve even for primary research when economic incentives differ across participating researchers.
