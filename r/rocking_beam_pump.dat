Figure  8 b {{indicates that the}} maximum value of torque factor of phased pump units decreased by 15.43 % than conventional <b>beam</b> <b>pumping</b> units that could effectively decrease polished rod torque. Figure  8 c shows the maximum load of phased pump units was smaller than conventional <b>beam</b> <b>pumping</b> units about 2.4 %. As Fig.  8 d shows that the phased pumping units’ peak torque decreased by 34.74 % than the conventional <b>beam</b> <b>pumping</b> units, the valley value of torque decreased by 90.14 %. Phased pump units could greatly eliminated the negative torque value. Therefore, the compared results indicate that phased pump units could effectively decrease the polished rod load and could decrease the power consumption.|$|R

30|$|The working {{principle}} of the <b>beam</b> <b>pumping</b> units is as follow: firstly, the motor converts the electrical energy into the rotational motion. Secondly, after twice reduction by the gearbox and the four-bar linkage, the rotary motion transforms into a linear reciprocating motion. At last, by the horse head, the beam hanger and the polished rod, the sucker rod drives the deep oil well pump. The core component of the <b>beam</b> <b>pumping</b> units is the four-bar linkage that is composed of the crank, the link bar, the rear arm, the connection line between the gearbox shaft and the shaft of the support. The four-bar linkage has the function that transforms the rotary motion of the gearbox into the reciprocating motion required to operate the downhole pump. The geometric parameters of the four-bar linkage have extremely important impact to the contour size and the working performance of the <b>beam</b> <b>pumping</b> units.|$|R

This article clarifies the key technology of how to build the solid modal and how to apply load and constraints. The analysis result of the modal shows that the lowest frequency of the pumping unit framework (API C- 228 D- 173 - 74) is 22. 39 Hz, which may be most likely resonant with the motor. We can adjust the rotate speed of the motor to avoid resonance. At the same time, the stiffness of the front legs is insufficient, suitable strengthen measures should be taken...|$|R

40|$|Photoinduced {{anisotropy}} in bacteriorhodopsin (BR) film {{arises from}} the selective bleaching of BR molecules to linearly polarized light. The kinetics of photoinduced anisotropy excited by single and two <b>pumping</b> <b>beams</b> are investigated theoretically and experimentally. Compared with a single <b>pumping</b> <b>beam</b> (650 nm), which produces comparatively small photoinduced anisotropy, dual-wavelength linearly polarized <b>pumping</b> <b>beams</b> (650 and 405 nm) can obviously change the photoinduced anisotropy. When the polarization orientation of the 405 ran <b>pumping</b> <b>beam</b> is perpendicular {{to that of the}} 650 nm <b>pumping</b> <b>beam,</b> the peak and steady values of the photoinduced anisotropy kinetic curves are remarkably enhanced. But when the two <b>pumping</b> <b>beams</b> have parallel polarization orientation, the peak and steady values are restrained. At a fixed intensity of the 650 nm <b>pumping</b> <b>beam,</b> there exists an optimal intensity for the 405 nm <b>pumping</b> <b>beam</b> to maximize the value of the photoinduced anisotropy.
