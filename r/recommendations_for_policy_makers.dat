40|$|In {{early stages}} SMEs {{were seen as}} {{insignificant}} supplement to large business supply, whereas today {{they have a very}} important social and economic role, because of their contribution to job creation. These contributions are very valuable in times of crises and rising unemployment. In Kosovo and the Western Balkan countries, including countries such as Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the development of SMEs can contribute in facing many challenges, effects of inequality, high level of unemployment and demographic challenges. In addition, SME development can contribute to strengthening the competitiveness and productivity, while also promoting the growth of income per capita. Besides the positive perception the creation of small and medium enterprises has, it is also indispensable to consider their extinction rate, being the most affected category of businesses, especially in the initial stages. It is proved that the net SME creation and cross-country differences in the relationship between new businesses and extinct businesses, can serve as a <b>recommendation</b> <b>for</b> <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> {{in order to create a}} favorable climate for small and medium enterprises.

5000|$|In general, {{public health}} {{scholars}} recommend that [...] "because health insurance schemes will remain limited {{for the foreseeable}} future, attention should focus on providing affordable health care to both uninsured migrants and the urban poor." [...] In light of this recommendation, further {{research has been conducted}} in order to assess the status of internal migration and health in China, as well as to provide more specific policy recommendations in order to address any issues. Research conducted by a team from Beijing Normal University and the Institute of Development Studies has provided a number of specific <b>recommendations</b> <b>for</b> <b>policy</b> <b>makers.</b> In a journal article published in The Lancet, this team voiced three primary concerns regarding the health of migrants in China. These concerns consisted of the spread of communicable and infectious disease, migrant maternal health, and occupational disease and injuries such as silicosis, chemical poisoning, and industrial machinery accidents. Beyond these three primary concerns, the researchers advise policy makers and public health officials {{to pay more attention to}} two additional issues. The first of these is mental and behavioural health, which is a [...] "domain that is understudied in China." [...] The second issue they discuss is that of risk perception. Little is known about how migrants perceive the [...] "various possibilities for health care: self-medication, informal healers, traditional medicine, private clinics with varied levels of care, and more formal hospital treatment." [...] Research into risk perception will [...] "be crucial to prevention, intervention, and other health-related measures for the migrant population in China.|$|E

It is concluded that the scope of agro-based industry is too high, because of the fact that our country depends on agriculture. All branches of agro based industry are very important because they increase industrial products, provide employment, earn foreign exchange, increase income level and also provide employment to women and provide base for development for backward areas. At the same time reduces pressure of population and migration, distributes the Wealth properly and can be established with small capital.

In Middle class and up to intermediate level education ratio of Tharparkar is much better than barrage area of Sindh province. At the graduate and postgraduate level barrage area is little higher in ratio than Tharparkar due to low facilities available in Tharparkar. The Minerals of Tharparkar may prove the better than barrage area. At the level of immediate measure for the development of Thar there is need of improvement of Rangeland, farmlands and races of livestock. The future of Thar is livestock with well-managed natural vegetation. ...|$|R
