5|$|In late October 2010, the Dutch court {{approved}} {{a request from}} Geert Wilders to have new judges appointed forcing the court to <b>retry</b> the case. On 7 February 2011, Wilders returned to the court room in order that his legal team could present evidence from Islamic experts which the court rejected in 2010, including Mohammed Bouyeri, who murdered film-maker Theo van Gogh, and Dutch academic Hans Jansen.|$|E
5|$|Innes' {{case against}} Marshall {{ended in a}} hung jury in 1814. Rather than <b>retry</b> the case, Marshall and Innes signed an {{agreement}} to end the legal battle in 1815. The agreement stipulated that neither man would write or publish anything that was disrespectful of the other. Innes upheld {{his part of the}} agreement, but in 1824, eight years after Innes' death, Marshall published an updated two-volume version of his History of Kentucky that was even more critical of Innes and others he suspected of participating in the Spanish Conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} {{three minutes to}} knock out the opponent. After three minutes, the match ends, and the player loses; the player cannot win by a decision. After losing, the player can use a {{continue}} and fight a rematch. The game ends after all continues have been used; the player must fight all opponents in the current circuit again. The game consists of four circuits in which the player must become the champion. The player can <b>retry</b> any circuit {{that has already been}} beaten. The game has a battery–backed memory in which players can save their data and records for future play.|$|E
50|$|Robustness {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{concerns}} upon which the specification is built, and as such resource management and connection/disconnection of devices becomes even more important than in wired USB. Packet loss and corruption are dealt with through timeouts as well as hardware buffering, guaranteed <b>retries</b> (as mentioned in the description of transfer models) and other flow control methods. If synchronism policies cannot be maintained, errors can be handled either by hardware or software (<b>retries,</b> maximum number of <b>retries</b> failure, failure recovery decisions and so on).|$|R
50|$|Instead of {{immediately}} <b>retrying</b> after a CAS fails, {{researchers have}} found that total system performance can be improved—in multiprocessor systems where many threads constantly update some particular shared variable—if threads that see their CAS fail use exponential backoff—in other words, wait a little before <b>retrying</b> the CAS.|$|R
30|$|Communication {{errors are}} handled with {{immediate}} message <b>retries.</b> Errors cause increased latencies.|$|R
5|$|Despite their {{unexpected}} naval success, the Confederate generals {{were still}} skeptical about their chances in the fort and held another late-night council of war, where {{they decided to}} <b>retry</b> their aborted escape plan. At dawn on February 15, the Confederates launched an assault led by Pillow against McClernand's division on the unprotected right flank of the Union line. The Union troops, unable {{to sleep in the}} cold weather, were not caught entirely by surprise, but Grant was. Not expecting a land assault from the Confederates, he was up before dawn and had headed off to visit Flag Officer Foote on his flagship downriver. Grant left orders that none of his generals was to initiate an engagement and no one was designated as second-in-command during his absence.|$|E
5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to <b>retry</b> the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E
25|$|If an {{external}} data storage device is unexpectedly disengaged or accidentally removed while copying files onto it, the user {{is given the}} chance to <b>retry</b> the operation without restarting that file copy operation from the beginning; this gives the user the chance to reconnect that external data storage device involved and <b>retry</b> the operation.|$|E

30|$|To gain {{a deeper}} insight, {{it could be}} helpful to see how {{wireless}} errors induce packet drops if the limit of <b>retries</b> is exceeded. Although wireless error sources cover receiving power attenuation, signal interference, multipath fading etc., the VQD design adopts the two-ray ground reflection model for simplicity, to avoid the complexity of multipath fading so that the main focus can {{be placed on the}} multi-access collision issue. Multi-access collisions (including both physical collisions among wireless stations and in-station virtual collisions among ACs) can trigger transmission <b>retries</b> in the MAC layer, and eventually packet drops if the limit of <b>retries</b> is exceeded in physical collisions.|$|R

25|$|On September 2, 2011, the {{district}} attorney's office {{announced that they}} intended to <b>retry</b> McInerney, and a hearing was scheduled for October 5, 2011. For the second trial, the prosecutors dropped the hate crime charge.|$|E

25|$|All {{three models}} {{supported}} a triple-mode redundancy configuration with three CPUs {{used in a}} byzantine fault tolerance scheme with bus freeze, instruction <b>retry,</b> and chip replacement signals. The V80 also added parity signals to its data and address buses.|$|E
25|$|After {{reviewing}} the Supreme Court decision {{and the response}} of the original prosecution team, which wanted to <b>retry</b> the case, the Justice Department announced on September 8, 2016, it would move to dismiss all charges against McDonnell and his wife.|$|E
25|$|Al-Hussayen {{accepted}} a deal, agreeing to deportation if the prosecutor dropped plans to <b>retry</b> {{him on the}} outstanding immigration charges. His wife and three sons returned to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia before him, and he was deported in July 2004. He and his wife both work in Riyadh.|$|E

30|$|From Figure  13, we {{see that}} several <b>retries</b> are {{required}} from 2.4 to 2.48 GHz channels due to interference in different environments. So, we have decided to operate the transceiver in a clear channel at 2.5 GHz which will cause minimum number of <b>retries</b> during data transmission. Note that, the Bluetooth device will not have any interference effect on Nordic transceiver as they work in a mutually exclusive way.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, because I-packets {{are more}} {{important}} than P-packets within the same GOP, I-packets should deserve a larger limit of <b>retries</b> than P-packets.|$|R
25|$|In 1895, when {{during his}} trials Wilde was {{released}} on bail, Douglas's cousin Sholto Johnstone Douglas stood surety for £500 of the bail money. The prosecutor opted to <b>retry</b> the case. Wilde was convicted on 25 May 1895 and sentenced to two years' hard labour, first at Pentonville, then Wandsworth, then famously in Reading Gaol. Douglas was forced into exile in Europe.|$|E
25|$|After his {{acquittal}} at {{the criminal}} trial, Al-Hussayen was still held in custody by immigration authorities. A few weeks later, he {{agreed not to}} appeal his deportation order if the prosecution agreed not to <b>retry</b> him for the remaining immigration charges. He was deported to Saudi Arabia in July 2004. His wife and three sons returned there voluntarily to meet him, rather than await deportation orders.|$|E
25|$|Were {{petitioner}} {{to satisfy}} the dissent's ‘probable innocence’ standard…the District Court would presumably be required to grant a conditional order of relief, which would in effect require the State to <b>retry</b> petitioner 10 years after his first trial, {{not because of any}} constitutional violation which had occurred at the first trial, but simply because of a belief that in light of petitioner's new-found evidence a jury might find him not guilty at a second trial.|$|E

25|$|The two appealed their {{sentences}}, although, in {{an unusual}} move for such a case, their prison sentences were not stayed pending appeal. In July, 2000, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-to-1 decision, overturned the convictions {{on the grounds that}} the original trial jury was improperly instructed regarding the possible implications of the statute of limitations on some of the conspiracy-related activities. With the reversal, the two defendants were released from prison, after serving 20 months. Federal prosecutors elected not to <b>retry</b> the two.|$|E
25|$|The {{progress}} of the trial—which had many aspects of guerrilla theater—was covered on the nightly news and made Kunstler the best-known lawyer in the country, and something of a folk hero. After much deadlock, the jury acquitted all seven on the conspiracy charge, but convicted five of violating the anti-riot provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. The Seventh Circuit overturned all the convictions on November 21, 1972 due to Hoffman's refusal to let defense lawyers question the prospective jurors on racial and cultural biases; the Justice Department did not <b>retry</b> the case.|$|E
25|$|On remand to the Federal Court of Appeals, House's {{petition}} for relief was granted. He {{was released from}} prison several months later in 2006 but returned due to procedural challenges from the state, and held for two more years. The prosecutor originally said he would <b>retry</b> House and believed that he was involved in the murder, but finally dropped the charges in May 2009. He said that new, more refined DNA tests of forensic evidence pointed to an unknown perpetrator. House spent over 22 years on Tennessee's death row before being released on bond in 2008.|$|E
