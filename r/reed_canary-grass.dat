40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the use of}} delayed harvested <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass</b> (Phalaris arundinacea) as a short fibre raw material for the pulp and paper industry. This study examines the following aspects of reed canary-grass: quality, transportation, storage, refining of the raw material by dry fractionation, chemical pulping, bleaching and paper production. The delayed harvesting method of <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass</b> produces an economically and environmentally sustainable short fibre raw material for the pulp and paper industry. The ash content and fibre properties of <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass</b> depend on soil type and growing location. The yearly variation in fibre yield and fibre properties is also considerable. There is, however, a potential for minimising quality variations by choosing <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass</b> varieties suitable to a specific growing location. The leaf and leaf sheath content of <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass</b> also affects {{the quality of the}} pulp. These quality variations can be eliminated by dry fractionation, a method that removes the unwanted parts of the grass. These unwanted parts {{can be used as a}} valuable bio-fuel raw material. Transport of reed canary grass after fractionation can be improved by briquetting, a method that doubles the transport capacity of <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass</b> compared to that of birch logs on a fibre basis. High quality short fibre chemical pulp can be produced from <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass.</b> The whole process from grass production to pulp production has been demonstrated successfully in full scale. Bleached <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass</b> pulp can be used in products such as fine paper and white-top liner paper...|$|E

40|$|Monitoring of {{invertebrates}} at four field {{sites in}} Herefordshire, England, growing miscanthus and <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass</b> {{was carried out}} in 2002, 2003 and 2004 to investigate the ecological impact of these crops on ground beetles, butterflies and arboreal invertebrates. Ground beetles were sampled by pitfall trapping; and arboreal invertebrates by sweep netting and stem beating. The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology’s Butterflies Monitoring Scheme methodology was used to record butterflies. The effects of the biomass crops on invertebrates were indirect, through the use of weeds as food resources and habitat. The greater diversity of weed flora within miscanthus fields than within <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass</b> fields had a greater positive effect on invertebrates. Ground beetles, butterflies and arboreal invertebrates were more abundant and diverse in the most floristically diverse miscanthus fields. The difference in crop architecture and development between miscanthus and <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass</b> was reflected in their differences in crop height and ground cover early on in the season. However, most of the difference in arthropod abundance between the two crops was attributed to the difference in the agronomic practice of growing the crops such as plant density, and the effect of this on weed growth. Since perennial rhizomatous grasses require a single initial planting and related tillage, and also no major chemical inputs; and because the crops are harvested in the spring and the land is not disturbed by cultivation every year, the fields were used as over-wintering sites for invertebrates suggesting immediate benefits to biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|Wildlife {{monitoring}} of two miscanthus and two <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass</b> fields in Herefordshire, England {{was carried out}} in 2002, 2003 and 2004 to investigate the ecological impact of perennial biomass grass crops on ground flora, small mammals and birds. Quadrats were used to record percentage ground vegetation cover within and around the periphery of each crop. Small mammals were sampled by live trapping using Longworth traps. The common bird census technique was used to monitor populations of birds. Miscanthus fields were richer in weed vegetation than <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass</b> or arable fields. Bird use of the biomass crop fields varied depending on species. There were considerably more open-ground bird species such as skylarks (Alauda arvensis), lapwings (Vanellus vanellus) and meadow pipits (Anthus pratensis) within miscanthus than within <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass</b> fields. There was no particular crop-type preference by the small mammal species, but rather a preference for good ground cover and little land disturbance, which was provided by both biomass crops. Ground flora, small mammals and most of the bird species (except open-ground birds) were found more abundantly within field margins and boundaries than in crop fields indicating the importance of retaining field structure when planting biomass crops. The miscanthus work relates entirely to young crops, which may be representative of part of the national crop if large areas are cultivated for rhizomes. The findings from the current project indicate that perennial biomass grass crops can provide substantially improved habitat for many forms of native wildlife, due to the low intensity of the agricultural management system and the untreated headlands...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} host mycotrophy on arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungal (AMF) markers was studied in a temperate agricultural soil cropped with mycorrhizal barley, flax, <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass,</b> timothy, caraway and quinoa and non-mycorrhizal buckwheat, dyer's woad, nettle and false flax. The percentage of AMF root colonization, {{the numbers of}} infective propagules by the Most Probable Number (MPN) method, and the amounts of signature Phospholipid Fatty Acid (PLFA) 16 : 1 ω 5 and Neutral Lipid Fatty Acid (NLFA) 16 : 1 ω 5 were measured as AMF markers.   Crop {{had a significant impact}} on MPN levels of AMF, on NLFA 16 : 1 ω 5 levels in bulk and rhizosphere soil and on PLFA 16 : 1 ω 5 levels in rhizosphere soil. <b>Reed</b> <b>canary-grass</b> induced the highest levels of AMF markers. Mycorrhizal markers were at low levels in all non-mycorrhizal crops. NLFA 16 : 1 ω 5 and the ratio of NLFA to PLFA 16 : 1 ω 5 from bulk soil are adequate methods as indicators of AMF biomass in soil...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of geostatistics to plant nematology {{was made by}} evaluating soil and nematode data acquired from 200 soil samples collected from the Ap horizon of a <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass</b> field in northern Minnesota. Geostatistical concepts relevant to nematology include semi-variogram modelling, kriging, and change of support calculations. Soil and nematode data generally followed a spherical semi-variogram model, with little random variability associated with soil data and large inherent variability for nematode data. Block kriging of soil and nematode data provided useful contour maps of the data. Change of snpport calculations indicated {{that most of the}} random variation in nematode data was due to short-range spatial variability in the nematode population densities...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to study the {{communities}} of epigeic beetles in plantations of fast growing plant species for energetic purposes. The method of pitfall trapping was used for beetle sampling. Four plots of fast growing plants were studied { [...] } Dactylis glomerata, Arrhenatherum elatius, Phalaris arundinacea and Helianthus tuberosus. Carabid beetles (Carabidae) and rove beetles (Staphylinidae) were used as bioindicators. It was found 18 species and 45 individuals of family Staphylinidae and 25 species and 594 individuals of family Carabidae (43 species nad 639 individuals in total). The highest number of species was found on plot of Dactylis glomerata (28 species) and {{the highest number of}} individuals was found on plot of Phalaris arundinacea (246 individuals). The majority of the beetles were carabid beetles belonging to the next species - Poecilus cupreus, Pseudophonus rufipes, Calathus fuscipes, Harpalus aeneus and Nebria brevicollis. These species occured in all plantations. Eurytopic species were more common than stenotopic in all habitats. The smallest value of index of human impact and so the biggest human impact was found in <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass.</b> It is supposed that the communities were influenced by the surrounding biotope (lawn) and the weather during the period of experiment...|$|E
40|$|Use of {{processed}} biofuels (pellets, briquettes) {{has greatly}} increased in Sweden in recent decades, mainly to replace fossil fuels in large boilers, e. g. in coal powder boilers. More recently, the demand from private households and residential heating systems has also increased, mainly due to conversion from fossil heating oil. This {{increased interest in}} pellets and briquettes for heating is beginning to cause a shortage of the traditional raw materials, sawdust and wood shavings, and therefore attention is turning to {{using a variety of}} agricultural products as raw material. Such raw materials include cultivated energy crops and wastes and by-products from agriculture. This study describes the typical systems currently used for production of pellets and briquettes and investigates the possibility of using energy crops (Salix, <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass</b> and hemp) and various wastes and by-products from processing of farm products (straw, cereal screenings, rape-seed meal and distiller’s waste) as raw materials. Previous experiences of pelleting and briquetting of these raw materials are reviewed in order to comprehensively identify possible combustion problems that may occur. On the basis of the results obtained, scenarios for possible production systems in a five-year perspective are presented and the costs and energy demands for these systems calculated. These future scenarios include largescale plants and micro-scale plants, as well as static and mobile equipment. The five main conclusions from the study are: - The farm raw materials of greatest interest for large-scale production are pelleted Salix and <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass.</b> They have competitive prices and acceptable fuel properties and could be mixed with sawdust in existing large-scale pelleting factories in Sweden. - Straw has low production costs but can cause serious ash-related problems. Hemp has too high production costs to be of commercial interest, while distiller’s waste and rape-seed meal currently have a higher alternative value when used as protein feed. Cereal screenings can be a suitable raw material provided that they only make up a minor proportion in mixtures with other more problem-free raw materials. - The scale of production has a great influence on production costs. In large-scale plants, the machinery and equipment, etc. are used much more efficiently than in smaller plants, which results in lower costs. - Small-scale pelleting, both static and mobile, requires cheap raw materials and a high through-put to be profitable. In most cases, briquetting would be more commercially viable. - The energy consumption in manufacturing pellets from dry farm by-products is generally no higher than when moist sawdust is used as the raw material. More energy is admittedly required for cultivation and transport of farm by-products, but since {{there is no need for}} drying the total energy consumption is often lower. However, wet raw materials such as fresh Salix and distiller’s waste can increase the total energy consumption...|$|E
40|$|Processing (upgrading) to dry {{and uniform}} fuels (briquettes, pellets, and powder) extend {{the use of}} biomass wastes as an energy source. Upgrading {{decreases}} transportation costs, increases storage capacity, and improves combustion properties. The intention of the present work {{was to investigate the}} effect of chemical characteristics and physical characteristics on processing, handling characteristics, combustion, and ash melting, using upgraded biofuels. The raw materials used was spring-harvested <b>reed</b> <b>canary-grass</b> (RCG) and wood residues (stemwood without bark). RCG with different ash contents was upgraded to briquettes and combustion experiments were done in a 180 kW boiler. RCG was found to be a suitable raw material for briquetting and variation in ash content did not affect the briquette quality. Combustion experiments showed that RCG can be burned with good result and the variation in ash content did not effect flue gas emissions. The ash formed during combustion showed a tendency to melt. Estimation of melting behaviour was done by ASTM fusion test, a bench scale fluidised-bed combustion test (5 kW), and by extracting melting behaviours from the ternary diagram SiO 2 -CaO-K 2 O. For RCG with low ash content (3 - 4 %), the tendency to melt was higher compared to RCG with high ash content (5 - 10 %). Wood powder cut in various impact mills and knife mills was characterised using sieve analysis, laser diffraction, image analysis, and a funnel method for measuring the tendency to bridge. The wood powder fuels were then combusted in a 150 kW powder burner to study emissions as a function of particle properties. Sieving and image analysis showed that impact mills produced wood powder with more fine particles than wood powder produced by knife mills. Image analysis showed that particle shapes differed between the two types of mills. The bridging tendency was higher for powder produced by impact mills than by knife mills. Combustion experiments showed that particle characteristics affected fuel feeding, ignition, unburned pollutants, furnace temperature, and content of unburned matter in ash. An increased content of smaller particles had a negative effect on fuel feeding and NO emissions were slightly increased while it had a positive effect on ignition, unburned pollutants (decreased) and content unburned matter (decreased) ...|$|E
