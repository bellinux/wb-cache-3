"My {{argument}} is that periods of Hamiltonian nation-building and rebuilding, like the 1790s-1820s, 1860s-1890s and 1930s-1960s, are followed by periods of Jeffersonian backlash, including the 1830s-1860s, the 1900s-1930s, and the 1970s-present. The neo-Jeffersonians trim back accomplishments of the previous Hamiltonian generation—national banking, emancipation, New Deal social programs—but usually fail to repeal them. As a result, the U.S. progresses at a pace of two steps forward, one step back. ... <b>Right</b> <b>on</b> <b>schedule,</b> the heroic Hamiltonian projects of national reconstruction {{that began with the}} New Deal and lasted through World War II and the Great Society program and the Civil Rights Revolution were followed by a generation-long backlash led by nostalgic Jeffersonian reactionaries. The first was Jimmy Carter, a conservative Democrat who played the role of the Southern Jeffersonian country boy. He and his allies dismantled much of the New Deal in the name of deregulation, leaving his equally Jeffersonian successor Reagan little to deregulate." ...|$|E

40|$|The most {{significant}} development {{during the year}} has been the strides which have been taken towards relieving the problem of our overcrowded general hospitals. The multi-storey block at Letterkenny has progressed <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>schedule</b> and leaves us confident that commissioning can take place early in 1981 as planned. In October 1979 the then Minister for Health, Mr. Charles Haughey, T. D., approved the Development Control Plan stage of the major extension to Sligo General Hospital. Rapid progress in the commencement of construction work in Sligo seems assured by Mr. Haughey's commitment to "cut corners" {{with a view to}} ensuring that the serious overcrowding in Sligo General is alleviated at an early date. The special attention afforded to the problem of alcohol abuse during the term of my predecessor has been followed through with increased emphasis on the theme of parental example and the focussing of attention on the necessity for revised legislation on the sale of alcohol to teenagers. lt is hoped that the lead and encouragement given to the public in this regard will be acted upon by statutory and voluntary organisations alike, in particular by the increased provision of leisure alternatives for our young people. Over recent years much ground work has been done in the adaptation and extension of our geriatric and smaller hospitals to cater for the community-based day services for the aged. I am happy to note that the lead given so well in earlier years by the day hospital services in my native Leitrim have been followed up on throughout the North West region resulting in a remarkable 80...|$|E
