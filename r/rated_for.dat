5|$|Fluor {{has been}} working on the cleanup and {{shutdown}} of atomic energy plants in Ohio and Washington since the 1990s. In 1992, Fluor won a contract with the United States Energy Department to clean up nuclear waste. By 1996 Hanford was the most contaminated nuclear site in the US and the US Department of Energy was conducting a $50 billion to $60 billion cleanup of the site. Fluor Hanford Inc. replaced Westinghouse Hanford Co. on the project. After a chemical explosion in 1997, 11 workers filed a lawsuit alleging they were denied appropriate medical attention and protective gear. Fluor and the workers disagreed on whether the explosion resulted in any injuries. In 2005 the US Department of Energy fined Fluor for safety violations and that same year a jury awarded $4.7 million in damages to 11 pipe fitters that claimed they were fired after complaining that a valve <b>rated</b> <b>for</b> 1,975 pounds-per-inch was being used where 2,235 were needed.|$|E

Results—With a decrease between 1990 and 1996 and an increase between 1996 and 2003, the trend in the cesarean <b>rate</b> <b>for</b> low-risk women having a first birth paralleled trends in the primary (regardless of parity) and total cesarean rates.

25|$|This is {{critically}} important for decoupling high-speed logic circuits from the power supply. The decoupling capacitor supplies transient current to the chip. Without decouplers, the IC demands current faster than the connection to the power supply can supply it, as parts of the circuit rapidly switch on and off. To counter this potential problem, circuits frequently use multiple bypass capacitors—small (100 nF or less) capacitors <b>rated</b> <b>for</b> high frequencies, a large electrolytic capacitor <b>rated</b> <b>for</b> lower frequencies and occasionally, an intermediate value capacitor.|$|E
