5|$|In 1999, then-President Hugo Sonnenschein {{announced}} plans to <b>relax</b> <b>the</b> university's famed core curriculum, {{reducing the number of}} required courses from 21 to 15. When The New York Times, The Economist, and other major news outlets picked up this story, the university became the focal point of a national debate on education. The changes were ultimately implemented, but the controversy played a role in Sonnenschein's decision to resign in 2000.|$|E
5|$|When the {{atrioventricular}} valves (tricuspid and mitral) are open, during {{blood flow}} to the ventricles, the aortic and pulmonary valves are closed to prevent backflow into the ventricles. When the ventricular pressure is greater than the atrial pressure the tricuspid and mitral valves will shut. When the ventricles contract the pressure forces the aortic and pulmonary valves open. As the ventricles <b>relax,</b> <b>the</b> aortic and pulmonary valves will close in response to decreased pressure.|$|E

5|$|Since the anemone lacks a rigid skeleton, the {{contractile}} cells pull {{against the}} fluid in the gastrovascular cavity, forming a hydrostatic skeleton. The anemone stabilizes itself by flattening its pharynx which {{acts as a}} valve, keeping the gastrovascular cavity at a constant volume and making it rigid. When the longitudinal muscles <b>relax,</b> <b>the</b> pharynx opens and the cilia lining the siphonoglyphs beat, wafting water inwards and refilling the gastrovascular cavity. In general, the sea anemone inflates its body to extend its tentacles and feed, and deflates it when resting or disturbed. The inflated body {{is also used to}} anchor the animal inside a crevice, burrow or tube.|$|E
5|$|Bhagyalakshmi, a young woman, has a car {{accident}} while returning from a party and is hospitalised with severe head injuries. When she recovers, she is diagnosed with retrograde amnesia and she fails to recognise her own parents. She mentally regresses {{to the state of}} a child. While she is undergoing treatment, she is kidnapped and sold to the madam of a brothel. Srinivas, also known as Cheenu, comes to Chennai to meet his old friend. Together, they visit the brothel to <b>relax.</b> <b>The</b> madam sends Bhagyalakshmi, renamed Vijaya, to his room. Cheenu realises that she is mentally still a child and pities her. He learns that she is from a cultured family, and that she was kidnapped and forced into prostitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} is {{innervated by}} the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying {{the muscles of}} the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles. The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may <b>relax</b> <b>the</b> muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, King James became {{increasingly}} unpopular in England. He alienated otherwise supportive Tories with {{his attempts to}} <b>relax</b> <b>the</b> Penal Laws, and he issued the Declaration of Indulgence in 1687, which established some freedom of religion, a move opposed by the Anglican church hierarchy. He increased {{the power of the}} regular army, an action seen by many Parliamentarians as a threat to their authority, and placed Catholics in important military positions. James also attempted to place sympathizers in Parliament who he hoped would repeal the Test Act, which required a strict Anglican religious test for many civil offices. Some Whigs and Tories set aside their political differences when his son and potential successor James was born in June 1688, and they conspired to replace him with his Protestant son-in-law William, Prince of Orange. The Dutch prince had tried fruitlessly to get James to reconsider his policies; he agreed to an invasion, and the nearly bloodless revolution that followed in November and December 1688 established William and his wife Mary as co-rulers.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 1985, Millwall visited Kenilworth Road for an FA Cup sixth round match. After only 14 {{minutes the}} match was halted as the visiting fans began to riot. The referee took both teams off for 25 minutes, before {{bringing}} {{them back on}} to complete the match. Following the final whistle, and a 1–0 victory for Luton, another pitch invasion and subsequent riot by away supporters caused noticeable damage {{to the ground and}} the surrounding area. Many of those arrested turned out to be supporters of teams other than Millwall. The club's chairman, David Evans, reacted by imposing a ban on all away supporters from Kenilworth Road {{from the start of the}} 1986–87 season as well as introducing a scheme that would require even home supporters to carry membership cards to be admitted to matches. The Football League insisted that Luton <b>relax</b> <b>the</b> ban for League Cup matches, but when Evans refused to allow Cardiff City fans to visit Kenilworth Road for their second round tie, the club were thrown out of the competition. The ban continued for four seasons, with exceptions for cup matches, before Luton Town repealed the ban before the 1990–91 season.|$|E
5|$|Radama's successor, Queen Ranavalona I (1828–61), {{responded to}} {{increasing}} {{political and cultural}} encroachment {{on the part of}} Britain and France by issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of Christianity in Madagascar and pressuring most foreigners to leave the territory. Residents of Madagascar could accuse one another of various crimes, including theft, Christianity and especially witchcraft, for which the ordeal of tangena was routinely obligatory. Between 1828 and 1861, the tangena ordeal caused about 3,000 deaths annually. Among those who continued to reside in Imerina were Jean Laborde, an entrepreneur who developed munitions and other industries on behalf of the monarchy, and Joseph-François Lambert, a French adventurer and slave trader, with whom then-Prince Radama II signed a controversial trade agreement termed the Lambert Charter. Succeeding his mother, Radama II (1861–63) attempted to <b>relax</b> <b>the</b> queen's stringent policies, but was overthrown two years later by Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony (1852–1865) and an alliance of Andriana (noble) and Hova (commoner) courtiers, who sought to end the absolute power of the monarch.|$|E

5|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bedser inside-edged a Lindwall bouncer onto his stumps, ending England's innings at 215, giving Australia a 135 first innings lead. Lindwall ended with 5/70. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he {{pretended not to}} notice Lindwall's pain. Lindwall was worried that Bradman had noticed his injury, but Bradman later claimed that he feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to <b>relax.</b> <b>The</b> weather was fine as Australia started their second innings. Barnes survived a missed stumping {{opportunity}} when he was 18 and he took advantage to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122. Morris was then bowled for 62, knocking a ball from Wright onto his stumps. Bradman joined Barnes at the crease and they amassed 174 runs for the second wicket. Barnes started slowly, but he accelerated after reaching his half-century. Once he reached his century, Barnes became particularly aggressive. He dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs, included two successive blows over the boundary for six. He was finally removed for 141, caught on the boundary from Yardley. He had struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings. The speed of his batting had allowed Australia to be 296/2 after 277 minutes when he departed. Hassett was bowled first ball, so Miller came to the crease at 296/3 to face Yardley's hat-trick ball. Miller survived a loud leg before wicket appeal on the hat-trick ball. Bradman was on 89 and heading towards a century in his last Test innings at Lord's when he fell to Bedser again, this time because of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich at slip. Brown joined Miller at 329/4 and Australia reached stumps at 343, without further loss, with Miller having struck one six into the grandstand.|$|E
