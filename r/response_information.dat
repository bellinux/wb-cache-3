50|$|After 1939, {{when many}} Gestapo {{personnel}} were called up for war-related work such as service with the Einsatzgruppen, {{the level of}} overwork and understaffing at the local offices increased. For information {{about what was happening}} in German society, the Gestapo continued to be mostly dependent upon denunciations. 80% of all Gestapo investigations were started in <b>response</b> to <b>information</b> provided by denunciations by ordinary Germans; while 10% were started in <b>response</b> to <b>information</b> provided by other branches of the German government and another 10% started in <b>response</b> to <b>information</b> that the Gestapo itself unearthed. The information supplied by denunciations, often led the Gestapo in determining whom was arrested.|$|R

40|$|A unique {{instrument}} {{has been}} associated with emerging markets of India and Pakistan. We show that the instrument can be considered a market <b>response</b> to the <b>information</b> gaps in these markets. The instrument may credibly transmit information and may eliminate information gaps. Hence, the birth of the instrument is, perhaps, an example of a creative market <b>response</b> to <b>information</b> problems. ...|$|R

5000|$|Private {{speech is}} used by {{children}} spontaneously and is a learned strategy to enhance memory. Private speech {{is used as a}} repetitive strategy, to enhance working memory by maintaining information to be remembered. For instance, a child might repeat a rule or story to him- or herself in order to remember it. Children also use private speech to aid their ability to suppress certain <b>responses</b> or <b>information,</b> and instead use other, less common <b>responses</b> or <b>information,</b> a process known as inhibitory control.2 ...|$|R
40|$|A {{peculiar}} {{carry over}} transaction facility {{has been associated}} with emerging markets of India and Pakistan. We show that the trading facility can be considered a market <b>response</b> to the <b>information</b> gaps in these markets. Information can be credibly transmitted through this trading facility. Hence, the emergence of such a trading facility is, perhaps, an example of a creative market <b>response</b> to <b>information</b> problems. ...|$|R

Procedure Questionnaires were distributed to biologists, rangers, animal carers and naturalists. Part 1 of the questionnaire aimed to {{determine the}} present distribution of sarcoptic mange in wombats (103 responses). Part 2 invited respondents to assess the prevalence of sarcoptic mange in wombats over a 3 month period (four <b>responses).</b> <b>Information</b> on wombats from 66 localities was received. Each locality represented an area of about 2500 km². Results Mange was observed at 93...|$|R

50|$|Several years later, in {{the wake}} of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, USA.gov participated in efforts led by the Department of Homeland Security and worked with over 20 federal {{agencies}} to develop guidance to communicate <b>response</b> <b>information</b> related to the storm and its aftermath. Agencies were encouraged to coordinate web information to avoid duplication and inconsistencies so the public could quickly and easily find critical information.|$|E

40|$|For multisensory {{stimulation}} {{to effect}} perceptual and behavioral <b>responses,</b> <b>information</b> {{from the different}} sensory systems must converge on individual neurons. A great deal is already known regarding processing within the separate sensory systems, as well as about many of the integrative and perceptual/behavioral effects of multisensory processing. However, virtually nothing {{is known about the}} functional architecture that underlies multisensory convergence even though it is an integral step to this processing sequence. This paper seeks to summarize the findings pertinent to multisensory convergence, and to initiate the identification of specific convergence patterns that may underlie different multisensory perceptual and behavioral effects. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

50|$|CAMEO {{initially}} was developed because NOAA {{recognized the need}} to assist first responders with easily accessible and accurate <b>response</b> <b>information.</b> Since 1988, EPA and NOAA have collaborated to augment CAMEO to assist both emergency responders and planners. CAMEO has been enhanced to provide emergency planners with a tool to enter local information and develop incident scenarios to better prepare for chemical emergencies. The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Coast Guard have worked with EPA and NOAA to continue to enhance the system.|$|E

The latter are free classes available to anyone, although only those with U.S. residency or work eligibility can take the final examinations. More information is available on the FEMA website under the [...] "Emergency Personnel" [...] and [...] "Training" [...] subheadings. Other emergency <b>response</b> <b>information</b> for citizens is also available at its website.|$|E
50|$|Transmission in {{synchronous}} {{frames of}} 450ms. Three characters are transmitted by Information Sending Station (ISS). Takes 210 milliseconds. The ISS then waits 240 ms for a <b>response.</b> <b>Information</b> Receiving Station (IRS) receives the three characters and checks that they each have 4 marks and 3 spaces. If they do, then the IRS transmits an acknowledgement. If they don't, then the IRS requests retransmission. At {{the beginning of}} the next frame, the ISS either retransmits the last 3 characters or the next three characters.|$|E

50|$|The Emergency <b>Response</b> <b>Information</b> Network (ERIN), is a 24-hour {{hurricane}} TV {{channel set}} up by the Dish Network. It was formerly called the Katrina Information Network. Dish network set up the channel to provide information on missing people from Hurricane Katrina, but then changed the name before Hurricane Rita came ashore. Dish Network provides the channel free of charge to all Dish customers. Important phone numbers and other updates provided by hurricane relief agencies are shown in addition to the names of missing or dislocated children and adults.|$|E

Additionally it offers literature searching, training, and outreach services. The library has {{a research}} and development (R&D) component, which works {{in areas such as}} open archives, recommendation systems (including visualization), emergency <b>response</b> <b>information</b> systems, and discovery systems. Its stated mission is to deliver effective and responsive knowledge services, thereby connecting people with information, technology, and resources.

Its highlight being that it can be created or updated without the help of web developers or any knowledge of HTML programming making it easier to use. A variety of information can be put up like forms to collect information, videos of the crisis, photos of the devastation, and maps that protect important natural resources and that help in search and rescue operations. Save the Children, an independent organization involved in rescue of children in case of natural calamities, has been regularly using this application.|$|E
