25|$|A bait car is {{a vehicle}} used by a law {{enforcement}} agency to capture car thieves. The vehicles are specially modified with features including GPS tracking and hidden cameras that <b>record</b> <b>audio,</b> video, time and date, which can all be remotely monitored by police. A remote-controlled immobilizer is installed in the vehicle that allows police to disable the engine and lock the doors. Jason Cecchettini invented the concept and technology in 1996.|$|E

500|$|In July 2009, {{the police}} {{installed}} {{closed circuit television}} (CCTV) cameras for [...] "safety and security". The police said that the cameras complemented the presence of their officers {{on the ground and}} did not <b>record</b> <b>audio</b> inputs. The move drew some negative reactions from the public. Former Nominated Member of Parliament Siew Kum Hong felt that the installation of CCTV cameras was [...] "pretty ridiculous", and wondered if the move might feed the perception in some quarters that Singapore is a police state, since Speakers' Corner is [...] "the one place in Singapore" [...] where people can demonstrate. Nevertheless, the cameras have not affected various events from being held. With effect from 1 December 2009, the size of Speakers' Corner was reduced so that it only occupies the half of Hong Lim Park nearer New Bridge Road. From 1 March 2012, Speakers' Corner was expanded to include an area behind Kreta Ayer NPP, near the junction of North Canal Road and South Bridge Road.|$|E

500|$|In {{the three}} months {{since the end of}} [...] "The Impossible Astronaut", the Doctor, Amy, Rory and River Song have been {{attempting}} to track the Silence, an alien race who cannot be remembered after they are encountered. Ex-FBI agent Canton Delaware, under the ruse of capturing them as criminals, helps to reunite the group inside a special prison at Area 51 containing the TARDIS. Though they do not yet know the name or motive for the aliens, the Doctor's allies have discovered they exist across the entire planet, and have the ability to place post-hypnotic suggestions in humans they encounter. The Doctor plants a communication device called a nanorecorder in each of the group's hands to <b>record</b> <b>audio</b> of meetings with the Silence. As they travel to Kennedy Space Center shortly before the launch of Apollo 11, Amy tells the Doctor she was mistaken and is not pregnant as she previously had claimed.|$|E
500|$|Salinger's final {{interview}} was in June 1980 with Betty Eppes of The Baton Rouge Advocate, {{which has been}} represented somewhat differently, depending on the secondary source. By one account, Eppes was an attractive young woman who misrepresented herself as an aspiring novelist, and managed to <b>record</b> <b>audio</b> of the interview as well as take several photographs of Salinger, both without his knowledge or consent. In a separate account, {{emphasis is placed on}} her contact by letter writing from the local Post Office, and Salinger's personal initiative to cross the bridge to meet with the woman, who {{in the course of the}} interview made clear she was a reporter (and who did indeed, at the close, take pictures of Salinger as he departed). According to the first account, the interview ended [...] "disastrously" [...] when a local passer-by from Cornish attempted to shake the famous author's hand, at which point Salinger became enraged. A further account of the interview published later in The Paris Review, purportedly by Eppes as author, has been disowned by Eppes and separately ascribed as a derived work of Review Editor George Plimpton.|$|E
500|$|As part of Parker's {{modernization}} efforts, {{the newspaper}} unit became the [...] "Public Information Division" [...] with Captain Stanley Sheldon in charge. He and Gene {{had known each}} other since Roddenberry attended Los Angeles City College. Roddenberry became Parker's speech writer, and wrote of the Chief's professional philosophy in the in-house magazine, The Beat, in September 1952. He reputedly based the Star Trek character Spock on Parker's rational and unemotional behavior. In this new office, he worked alongside Don Ingells, who would go on to create Fantasy Island, and write episodes for Star Trek such as [...] "The Alternative Factor". The Association for Professional Law Enforcement was founded on November 12, 1952, with Roddenberry as one of the founding members and spokesman. He said at the time that: [...] "We are of the opinion that professional ethics and practical police work are completely compatible and we intend to meet together to promote this compatibility." [...] Following this, Roddenberry began a correspondence with Erle Stanley Gardner, creator of the Perry Mason novels. The duo would <b>record</b> <b>audio</b> letters and send them to each other. Gardner forwarded Roddenberry's comments to Harry Steeger, who felt that he and Roddenberry had similar opinions on law enforcement. Gardner began to seek Roddenberry's opinion of his work, including allowing him a preview of The Court of Last Resort.|$|E
