5|$|Technetium can {{catalyse}} {{the destruction}} of hydrazine by nitric acid, and this property is due to its multiplicity of valencies. This caused {{a problem in the}} separation of plutonium from uranium in nuclear fuel processing, where hydrazine is used as a protective <b>reductant</b> to keep plutonium in the trivalent rather than the more stable tetravalent state. The problem was exacerbated by the mutually-enhanced solvent extraction of technetium and zirconium at the previous stage, and required a process modification.|$|E

25|$|As in {{hydrogenation}} {{reactions of}} other functional groups, the <b>reductant</b> in C=N hydrogenations is either hydrogen gas or a transfer hydrogenation <b>reductant</b> such as formic acid. The process is usually catalyzed by {{a transition metal}} complex. If the complex is chiral and non-racemic and the substrate is prochiral, an excess of a single enantiomer of a chiral product can result.|$|E

When we use different <b>reductants,</b> the reduction capabilities and other effects of the different <b>reductants</b> are different, which affects the hydrogen storage capacity of the DWCNTs.

30|$|The {{formation}} of the similar electrolyte shells {{on the surface of}} aerosol particles, due either to their atmospheric oxidation or to the other above-mentioned processes, e.g., similar to the volume co-condensation of the mixed vapour of <b>reductants</b> and electrolytes, can initiate an alternative electrochemical ion-mediated oxidation of the core particles <b>reductants</b> and, under pre-ionization conditions, convert such particles into aerosol discharge-shorted batteries-nanocapsules.|$|R
25|$|The {{simplest}} inorganic {{reaction is}} double displacement when in mixing of two salts the ions are swapped without {{a change in}} oxidation state. In redox reactions one reactant, the oxidant, lowers its oxidation state and another reactant, the <b>reductant,</b> has its oxidation state increased. The net result is an exchange of electrons. Electron exchange can occur indirectly as well, e.g., in batteries, a key concept in electrochemistry.|$|E
25|$|The UREX {{process is}} a PUREX process which has been {{modified}} to prevent the plutonium from being extracted. This {{can be done by}} adding a plutonium <b>reductant</b> before the first metal extraction step. In the UREX process, ~99.9% of the uranium and >95% of technetium are separated from each other and the other fission products and actinides. The key is the addition of acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) to the extraction and scrub sections of the process. The addition of AHA greatly diminishes the extractability of plutonium and neptunium, providing somewhat greater proliferation resistance than with the plutonium extraction stage of the PUREX process.|$|E
25|$|The atom or {{molecule}} which loses electrons {{is known}} as the reducing agent, or <b>reductant,</b> and the substance which accepts the electrons is called the oxidizing agent, or oxidant. Thus, the oxidizing agent is always being reduced in a reaction; the reducing agent is always being oxidized. Oxygen is a common oxidizing agent, but not the only one. Despite the name, an oxidation reaction does not necessarily need to involve oxygen. In fact, a fire can be fed by an oxidant other than oxygen; fluorine fires are often unquenchable, as fluorine is an even stronger oxidant (it has a higher electronegativity and thus accepts electrons even better) than oxygen.|$|E

On the basis of observed data, a tentative mechanism for the photoreduction of malachite green has been proposed...|$|R
5000|$|NMDA {{receptor}} {{function is}} also strongly regulated by chemical reduction and oxidation, via the so-called [...] "redox modulatory site." [...] Through this site, <b>reductants</b> dramatically enhance NMDA channel activity, whereas oxidants either reverse {{the effects of}} <b>reductants</b> or depress native responses. It is generally believed that NMDA receptors are modulated by endogenous redox agents such as glutathione, lipoic acid, and the essential nutrient pyrroloquinoline quinone.|$|R

25|$|Samarium iodide is {{conveniently}} {{generated in}} the reaction of samarium metal with either diiodomethane or diiodoethane. The use of diiodomethane is convenient because the oxidant is a liquid (diiodoethane is a solid). Although pure SmI2 is air sensitive, solutions of the reagent may be manipulated in air without special precautions. SmI2 reacts very slowly with water and even more slowly with alcohols. Alcohols are commonly used as co-solvents or proton sources in SmI2 reductions, as immediate quenching of negatively charged intermediates with a proton source has proven beneficial for reaction yields. Importantly, because SmI2 is a one-electron <b>reductant,</b> multiple equivalents must be used to accomplish two-electron reductions of organic substrates. In most cases, a stoichiometric amount of the reagent or slight excess is sufficient.|$|E
25|$|The {{reactivity}} of NaBH4 {{can be enhanced}} or augmented {{by a variety of}} compounds. Oxidation with iodine in tetrahydrofuran gives the borane–tetrahydrofuran complex, which can reduce carboxylic acids. Likewise, the NaBH4-MeOH system, formed by the addition of methanol to sodium borohydride in refluxing THF, reduces esters to the corresponding alcohols. Mixing water or an alcohol with the borohydride converts some of it into unstable hydride ester, which is more efficient at reduction, but the <b>reductant</b> will eventually decompose spontaneously to give hydrogen gas and borates. The same reaction can run also intramolecularly: an α-ketoester converts into a diol, since the alcohol produced will attack the borohydride to produce an ester of the borohydride, which then reduces the neighboring ester. The combination of NaBH4 with carboxylic acids results in the formation of acyloxyborohydride species. These can perform a variety of reductions not normally associated with borohydride chemistry, such as alcohols to hydrocarbons and nitriles to primary amines.|$|E
500|$|Because of the {{sensitivity}} of potassium to water and air, reactions with other elements are possible only in an inert atmosphere such as argon gas using air-free techniques. Potassium does not react with most hydrocarbons such as mineral oil or kerosene. It readily dissolves in liquid ammonia, up to 480 g per 1000 g of ammonia at 0°C. Depending on the concentration, the ammonia solutions are blue to yellow, and their electrical conductivity {{is similar to that}} of liquid metals. In a pure solution, potassium slowly reacts with ammonia to form , but this reaction is accelerated by minute amounts of transition metal salts. Because it can reduce the salts to the metal, potassium is often used as the <b>reductant</b> in the preparation of finely divided metals from their salts by the Rieke method. For example, the preparation of magnesium by this method employs potassium as the reductant: ...|$|E

Microorganisms sense environ-mental Fe deficiency and produce low-molecular-weight Fe-chelating agents, siderophores, to solubilize Fe(III) (hydr) ox-ides and transport Fe into cells (2, 5, 15). Siderophores bind Fe 3 with extremely high affinity, and this high formation con-stant between siderophore and Fe 3 {{is believed to be}} the driving force that facilitates the dissolution of Fe(III) (hydr) ox-ides (3, 5, 8).
