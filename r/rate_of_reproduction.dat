5|$|Angel sharks {{in general}} are highly {{threatened}} by commercial trawl fisheries due to their susceptibility to capture and low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction,</b> and angel shark species elsewhere {{are known to have}} declined markedly under fishing pressure. Trawling activity in the Yellow Sea {{and other parts of the}} northwestern Pacific is intense and, coupled with pollution, has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem. The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to have declined by up to 50% or more under these conditions, leading the species to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It may benefit from a ban on trawling imposed in some areas by the Chinese government, though enforcement is inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction,</b> given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{experiments}} to study evolution and genetics. Laboratory mice, flies, fish, and worms are inbred through many generations to create strains with defined characteristics. These provide animals of a known genetic background, {{an important tool}} for genetic analyses. Larger mammals are rarely bred specifically for such studies due to their slow <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction,</b> though some scientists take advantage of inbred domesticated animals, such as dog or cattle breeds, for comparative purposes. Scientists studying how animals evolve use many animal species to see how variations in where and how an organism lives (their niche) produce adaptations in their physiology and morphology. As an example, sticklebacks are now being used to study how many and which types of mutations are selected to produce adaptations in animals' morphology during the evolution of new species.|$|E

50|$|Monotremes, {{like all}} mammals, lactate, {{but they have}} no defined nipples, excreting the milk from their mammary glands via {{openings}} in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> and relatively prolonged parental care of infants.|$|R
5|$|Despite its size, {{the common}} {{thresher}} is minimally dangerous to humans {{due to its}} relatively small teeth and timid disposition. It is highly valued by commercial fishers for its meat, fins, hide, and liver oil; large numbers are taken by longline and gillnet fisheries throughout its range. This shark is also esteemed by recreational anglers for the exceptional fight it offers on hook-and-line. The common thresher has a low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> and cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure for long, {{a case in point}} being the rapid collapse of the thresher shark fishery off California in the 1980s. With commercial exploitation increasing {{in many parts of the}} world, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the {{angelshark}} is a nocturnal ambush predator that buries itself in sediment and waits for passing prey, mostly benthic bony fishes, but also skates and invertebrates. An aplacental viviparous species, females bear litters of seven to 25 pups every other year. The angelshark normally poses little danger to humans, though if provoked, it is quick to bite. Since the mid-20th century, intense commercial fishing across the angelshark's range has decimated its population via bycatch – it is now locally extinct or nearly so across most of its northern range, and the prospects of the remaining fragmented subpopulations are made more precarious by its slow <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction.</b> As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Critically Endangered.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species in}} the animal kingdom turn to sexual {{activity}} {{as a way to}} solve a disagreement. Bonobos are one species notoriously known for using sexual behavior to relieve their aggression with each other. Sex is part of bonobo’s daily routine and social life. Unlike other primates aggression is substituted with sex. Sexual activity in bonobos is very high, yet the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> is the same as a chimpanzee.|$|E

40|$|It {{appears that}} coyote (Canis latrans) {{abundance}} is determined primarily by availability of food (prey) as mediated through social dominance hierarchies and a territorial land tenure system.

25|$|Late in his life, Shockley became {{intensely}} {{interested in}} questions of race, human intelligence, and eugenics. He thought {{this work was}} important to the genetic future {{of the human species}} and he came to describe it as the most important work of his career, even though expressing his views damaged his reputation. Shockley argued that a higher <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> among the less intelligent was having a dysgenic effect, and that a drop in average intelligence would ultimately lead to a decline in civilization. With regard to racial differences he used the following standard statement, e.g., on a debate with Afro-centrist Frances Welsing and on Firing Line with William F. Buckley Jr.:My research leads me inescapably to the opinion that the major cause of the American Negro's intellectual and social deficits is hereditary and racially genetic in origin and, thus, not remediable to a major degree by practical improvements in the environment.Shockley's published writings and lectures to scientific organizations on this topic were partly based on the writings of psychologist Cyril Burt and were funded by the Pioneer Fund. Shockley also proposed that individuals with IQs below 100 be paid to undergo voluntary sterilization.|$|E
500|$|Bouchard's speeches asked Quebecers to vote [...] "Yes" [...] {{to give a}} clear {{mandate for}} change, and that only the clarity of a [...] "Yes" [...] vote would provide a final {{solution}} to Canada's long standing constitutional issues and a new partnership with English Canada {{for the betterment of}} both. Bouchard's popularity was such that his remarks that the Québécois were the [...] "white race" [...] with the lowest <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction,</b> which threatened to cast the project as focused on ethnic nationalism, were traversed with ease. Bloc Québécois MP Suzanne Tremblay was less successful in this regard, and apologized after answering journalist Joyce Napier's question of how minority francophones outside of Quebec would be helped by independence by stating that Napier's last name and lack of a Québécois accent made her ignorant of the subject.|$|E
500|$|The exact size of Paraceratherium {{is unknown}} {{because of the}} incompleteness of the fossils. Its weight is {{estimated}} to have been [...] at most; the shoulder height was about , and the length about [...] The legs were long and pillar-like. The long neck supported a skull that was about [...] long. It had large, tusk-like incisors and a nasal incision that suggests it had a prehensile upper lip or proboscis. The lifestyle of Paraceratherium may have been {{similar to that of}} modern large mammals such as the elephants and extant rhinoceroses. Because of its size, it would have had few predators and a slow <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction.</b> It was a browser, eating mainly leaves, soft plants, and shrubs. It lived in habitats ranging from arid deserts with a few scattered trees to subtropical forests. The reasons for the animal's extinction are unknown, but various factors have been proposed.|$|E
5000|$|Frederick Osborn's 1937 journal article [...] "Development of a Eugenic Philosophy" [...] framed it as {{a social}} {{philosophy}}—that is, a philosophy with implications for social order.

50|$|Negative density-dependent (restriction) {{processes}} {{contribute to}} the resilience of macroparasite populations. At high parasite populations, restriction processes tend to restrict population growth rates and {{contribute to the}} stability of these populations.

500|$|The species' low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> {{and long}} period of {{immaturity}} render it vulnerable to rapid change in the environment as response and recovery are slow. Their habit of forming flocks predisposes them to outbreaks of disease and localised adverse weather events. A probable {{outbreak of a disease}} led to the deaths of up to 23 breeding female cockatoos at Koobabbie in September–October 2009, a hailstorm killed 68 individuals around Perth on 22 March 2010, and 145 perished in a heatwave around Hopetoun when temperatures reached [...] on 6 January 2010. Temperature and weather extremes in southwest Australia are predicted to worsen with climate change. Carnaby's black cockatoos have been brought to veterinary hospitals with traumatic injuries. Motor vehicles are a hazard, as much vegetation useful to Carnaby's black cockatoos lies on road verges. The cockatoos fly into open space when leaving the vegetation, which is often over a road and in the path of oncoming traffic.|$|E
6000|$|In {{our survey}} of the lively {{discussion}} which has been raised, it matters little how our own particular opinions may incline. But we may confess to an impression, thus far, that {{the doctrine of the}} permanent and complete immutability of species has not been established, and may fairly be doubted. We believe that species vary, and that [...] "Natural Selection" [...] works; but we suspect that its operation, like every analogous natural operation, may be limited by something else. Just as every species by its natural <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> would soon completely fill any country it could live in, but does not, being checked by some other species or some other condition--so it may be surmised that variation and natural selection have their struggle and consequent check, or are limited by something inherent in the constitution of organic beings.|$|E
60|$|As all the {{inhabitants}} of each country may be said, owing to their high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction,</b> to be striving to increase in numbers; as each form comes into competition with many other forms {{in the struggle for}} life,--for destroy any one and its place will be seized by others; as every part of the organisation occasionally varies in some slight degree, and as natural selection acts exclusively by the preservation of variations which are advantageous under the excessively complex conditions to which each being is exposed, no limit exists to the number, singularity, and perfection of the contrivances and co-adaptations which may thus be produced. An animal or a plant may thus slowly become related in its structure and habits in the most intricate manner to many other animals and plants, and to the physical conditions of its home. Variations in the organisation will in some cases be aided by habit, or by the use and disuse of parts, and they will be governed by the direct action of the surrounding physical conditions and by correlation of growth.|$|E
50|$|The {{tolerance}} {{model is}} completely dependent upon life history characteristics. Each species has an equally likely chance to establish {{itself in the}} early stages of succession and their establishment results in no environmental changes or impacts on other species. Eventually, early species, typically dominated by r-selected species, which prioritize fast <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction,</b> are out-competed by K-selected species (species that become more dominant when there is competition for limited resources).|$|R
40|$|Estimating the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> clonal <b>reproduction</b> {{in natural}} {{population}} of diploid organisms is recognised as being problematic {{and even the}} detection of strictly clonal populations is often controversial. One well-acknowledged signature <b>of</b> clonal <b>reproduction</b> is the generation of non-random associations between loci. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is thus often used for estimating the amount <b>of</b> clonal <b>reproduction.</b> Here we explore with computer simulations the effect <b>of</b> the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> clonal <b>reproduction</b> on LD estimates obtained from different estimators within a comprehensive parameter range. None of the LD estimators studied is able to accurately measure the proportion of clonal (or sexual) reproduction on its own, due to strong bias, incoherent behaviour, or huge variances. The joint use of several statistics is thus recommended for the estimation <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> clonal <b>reproduction</b> in natural populations. We hope that our work will provide useful tools {{for the study of}} clonal diploids, many of which can only be studied with molecular markers, as it is the case for medically important parasites...|$|R
40|$|The tuatara of New Zealand is {{a unique}} reptile that coexisted with dinosaurs and has changed little morphologically from its Cretaceous relatives.

60|$|Wild {{animals in}} {{confinement}} seldom propagate their kind. Only a few caged birds will continue their species. Whatever upsets {{the balance of}} the organism, in an individual or a race tends first of all to affect the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Civilise the red man, and he begins to decrease at once in numbers. Turn the Sandwich Islands into a trading community, and the native Hawaiian refuses forthwith to give hostages to fortune. Tahiti is dwindling. From the moment the Tasmanians were taken to Norfolk Island, not a single Tasmanian baby was born. The Jesuits made a model community of Paraguay; but they altered the habits of the Paraguayans so fast that the reverend fathers, who were, of course, themselves celibates, were compelled to take strenuous and even grotesque measures to prevent the complete and immediate extinction of their converts. Other cases in abundance I might quote an I would; but I limit myself to these. They suffice to exhibit the general principle involved; any grave upset in the conditions of life affects first and at once the fertility of a species.|$|E
60|$|As {{each species}} tends by its {{geometrical}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> to increase inordinately in number; {{and as the}} modified descendants of each species will be enabled to increase {{by as much as}} they become more diversified in habits and structure, so as to be able to seize on many and widely different places in the economy of nature, there will be a constant tendency in natural selection to preserve the most divergent offspring of any one species. Hence during a long-continued course of modification, the slight differences characteristic of varieties of the same species, tend to be augmented into the greater differences characteristic of the species of the same genus. New and improved varieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the older, less improved and intermediate varieties; and thus species are rendered to a large extent defined and distinct objects. Dominant species belonging to the larger groups within each class tend to give birth to new and dominant forms; so that each large group tends to become still larger, {{and at the same time}} more divergent in character. But as all groups cannot thus go on increasing in size, for the world would not hold them, the more dominant groups beat the less dominant. This tendency in the large groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character, together with the inevitable contingency of much extinction, explains the arrangement of all the forms of life in groups subordinate to groups, all within a few great classes, which has prevailed throughout all time. This grand fact of the grouping of all organic beings under what is called the Natural System, is utterly inexplicable on the theory of creation.|$|E

40|$|The {{consequences}} <b>of</b> variable <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> clonal <b>reproduction</b> on {{the population}} genetics of neutral markers are explored in diploid organisms within a subdivided population (island model). We use both analytical and stochastic simulation approaches. High <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> clonal <b>reproduction</b> will positively affect heterozygosity. As a consequence, nearly twice as many alleles per locus can be maintained and population differentiation estimated as F(ST) value is strongly decreased in purely clonal populations as compared to purely sexual ones. With increasing clonal reproduction, effective population size first slowly increases and then points toward extreme values when the reproductive system tends toward strict clonality. This {{reflects the fact that}} polymorphism is protected within individuals due to fixed heterozygosity. Contrarily, genotypic diversity smoothly decreases with increasing <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> clonal <b>reproduction.</b> Asexual populations thus maintain higher genetic diversity at each single locus but a lower number of different genotypes. Mixed clonal/sexual reproduction is nearly indistinguishable from strict sexual reproduction as long as the proportion <b>of</b> clonal <b>reproduction</b> is not strongly predominant for all quantities investigated, except for genotypic diversities (both at individual loci and over multiple loci) ...|$|R

40|$|In the Swaziland lowlands, {{biological}} {{control of the}} citrus pest red scale, Aonidiella aurantii (Mask), has been consistently unsuccessful although it is successful in middle altitude regions. However, recent cases of resistance to organophosphate insecticides elsewhere in southern Africa, make it important to reconsider {{biological control}} of red scale in the lowlands. Should similar resistance be evolved in this region, the pest could be controlled only by natural means together with oils. This account attempts {{to answer questions about}} the natural control of a red scale population in the lowlands, by examining data collected between 1972 and 1975. The population was continuously breeding with overlapped generations. It consisted of three sections, on leaves, twigs and fruit, having different <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction,</b> development and mortality. These sections are considered separately but that on leaves, being relatively unimportant, is largely ignored. The generation mortality is estimated in the sections on twigs and fruit and related to climatic and biotic indices. The causes of seasonal and between-years variation in the sections on twigs and fruit are elucidated. The effectiveness of each kind of natural enemy is examined and the factors affecting natural enemy numbers are investigated. The question of population regulation is discussed. Differences in mean infestation levels in middle altitude and lowland regions are explained in terms <b>of</b> different <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> and mortality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As an order, Parrots (Psittaciformes) {{are both}} the longest lived birds {{and among the}} most endangered. Palm Cockatoos (Probosciger aterrimus) have an {{extremely}} slow life history, including one <b>of</b> the lowest <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> breeding success reported for parrots. Here we use population viability analysis (PVA) to examine whether populations of Palm Cockatoos are viable {{in the long term}} with such low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction.</b> We built PVA models for two field sites with robust data on reproductive success and availability of nest-hollows: Iron Range on Cape York Peninsula (Queensland, Australia) and Crater Mountain (Eastern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea). Our Iron Range models incorporate a fluctuating resource base of nest-hollows resulting from natural losses from fire, wind and tree decay and natural replenishment through tree breakages in tropical cyclones. The number of females allowed to breed each year in the simulations was limited by the availability of hollows. Our Iron Range models suggest that the population is only viable if juvenile and adult mortality rates are very low, and that at least some birds in the population live to 100 years old. Based on known maximum lifespans in the Cacatuidae, we conclude that Palm Cockatoos at Iron Range are unlikely to live for long enough on average to support their low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction,</b> and highlight the possibility that the population may be in decline. At Crater Mountain, where nestlings are harvested for food by local people, the models suggest that the reported current <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 40 % of nestlings taken is not sustainable...|$|R
