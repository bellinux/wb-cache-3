40|$|Objective: A {{subset of}} women who are at {{elevated}} cancer risk due to family history exhibit evidence of cancer-specific distress. These stress responses may represent symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The present study assessed rates of PTSD related to personal or family cancer history and BRCA 1 / 2 testing. Methods: Participants were 84 women enrolled in a larger project focused on genetic testing decisions. Semistructured diagnostic interviews were used to identify instances of threshold and subthreshold PTSD. Results: Results indicated that 16. 7 % of the women <b>reported</b> current <b>threshold</b> or subthreshold PTSD related to personal or family cancer history. An additional 26. 2 % <b>reported</b> past-only cancer-related <b>threshold</b> or subthreshold PTSD. Of the 65 women who received BRCA 1 / 2 results and completed the test-related PTSD module, only 7. 7 % <b>reported</b> <b>threshold</b> or subthreshold PTSD related to the genetic testing process. However, when rates were examined based on carrier status, 25. 0 % of BRCA 1 / 2 carriers <b>reported</b> test-related <b>threshold</b> or subthreshold PTSD compared with only 10. 0 % of variants and 2. 3 % of noncarriers. Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that both personal and family cancer diagnoses can be significant stressors for a subset of high-risk women. Rates of threshold and subthreshold PTSD related to genetic testing appear to be less common, although carriers may be at higher risk for significant posttraumatic symptoms.

40|$|Most {{national}} {{surveys of}} health care utilisation capture only self-reported measures of morbidity. If self-reported morbidity is measured with error, then the results of applied work may be misleading. In this {{paper we propose a}} model of the relationship between morbidity and health service utilisation which allows for reporting errors and simultaneity. Errors in self-reported morbidity are expressed as a function of person-specific <b>reporting</b> <b>thresholds</b> and recent contact with health services, arising because of better self-evaluation of current health status or a desire to justify consumption of a publicly-provided good. We demonstrate the bias in ignoring the potential problems of reporting errors and simultaneity for a variety of special cases, but in the general case the biases are of ambiguous sign. The empirical nature of these biases is investigated using limiting long-standing illness (LLI) and recent contact with a General Practitioner (GP) in two waves of The UK Health and Lifestyle Survey. Biomedical measures of functioning are used as objective indicators of health status. We find evidence of substantial and significant differences between individuals in <b>reporting</b> <b>thresholds</b> and some evidence that the reporting of LLI may depend on recent visits to a GP. Adjustments for these biases significantly increase the estimated effect of morbidity on utilisation.

40|$|International audienceCooked or sulfurous {{off-flavour}} {{caused by}} volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) limits acceptance of ultra-high temperature (UHT) milk {{in some parts}} of the world. Therefore, the concentrations of VSCs in UHT milk over 16  weeks of storage were studied and compared with those in pasteurised milk. The major VSCs contributing to the cooked flavour were identified using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography with pulsed flame photometric detection. Nine VSCs were detected in commercial indirectly processed UHT skim and whole milk. These were hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, carbon disulfide, dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl sulfone and dimethyl trisulfide. An additional VSC was detected but not identified. The concentrations of hydrogen sulfide, methanthiol, dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl trisulfide were initially higher than their <b>reported</b> <b>threshold</b> values indicating their importance in milk flavour, especially cooked flavour. However, they decreased slowly during storage to levels below their threshold values. This decrease corresponded to a decrease in dissolved oxygen level. Four VSCs, carbon disulfide, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethyl disulfide, were detected in pasteurised milk; however, their concentrations were lower than their <b>reported</b> <b>threshold</b> values. This paper puts into perspective the significance of VSCs in the flavour of UHT and pasteurised milk, both initially and during storage, and indicates the period of storage for minimisation of cooked flavour in UHT milk...|$|R
