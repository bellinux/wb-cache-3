50|$|The axis of this Laplace {{plane is}} {{coplanar}} with, and between, (a) the polar {{axis of the}} parent planet's spin, and (b) the orbital axis of the parent planet's orbit around the Sun. The Laplace plane arises because the equatorial oblateness of the parent planet tends to cause the orbit of the satellite to precess around the polar axis of the parent planet's equatorial plane, while the solar perturbations tend to cause the orbit of the satellite to precess around the polar axis of the parent planet's orbital plane around the Sun. The two effects acting together result in an intermediate position for the <b>reference</b> <b>axis</b> for the satellite orbit's precession.|$|E

40|$|The mission {{requirements}} for some satellites require that they spin continuously {{and at the}} same time maintain a precise direction of the spin axis. An analog-computer study has been made of an attitude control system which is suitable for such a satellite. The control system provides the necessary attitude control through the use of a spinning wheel, which will provide precession torques, commanded by an automatic closed-loop servomechanism system. The sensors used in the control loop are rate gyroscopes for damping of any wobble motion and a sun seeker for attitude control. The results of the study show that the controller can eliminate the wobble motion of the satellite resulting from a rectangular pulse moment disturbance and then return the spin <b>axis</b> to the <b>reference</b> space <b>axis.</b> The motion is damped to half amplitude in less than one cycle of the wobble motion. The controller can also reduce the motion resulting from a step change in product of inertia both by causing the new principal axis to be steadily alined with the spin vector and by reducing the cone angle generated by the <b>reference</b> body <b>axis.</b> These methods will reduce the motion whether the satellite is a disk, sphere, or rod configuration...|$|R
