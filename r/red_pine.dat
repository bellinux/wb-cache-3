5|$|Forests make {{up about}} , or 48 percent, of the province's land area. The forests consist of pines (Jack Pine, <b>Red</b> <b>Pine,</b> Eastern White Pine), spruces (White Spruce, Black Spruce), Balsam Fir, Tamarack (larch), poplars (Trembling Aspen, Balsam Poplar), birches (White Birch, Swamp Birch) and small pockets of Eastern White Cedar.|$|E
5|$|Suillus bovinus {{is found}} in conifer woods and {{plantations}} across Europe, including subalpine regions in the Alps, up to altitudes of 800m (2500ft). It is common in Lithuania, where it associates with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), the only naturally occurring pine in that country. Preferred soils of S.bovinus are often acidic, sand-based, or sometimes calcareous (chalky) and moraine. In Asia, it has been recorded in Taiwan, and in Japan, where it associates with Japanese <b>red</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus densiflora). In China, it has been recorded from provinces Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang.|$|E
5|$|Suillus luteus is {{a pioneer}} species that {{typically}} establishes {{itself in the}} early stages of forest succession. The fungus forms mycorrhizal associations with various species of pine, including Scots pine (P.sylvestris), black pine (P.nigra), and Macedonian pine (P.peuce) in Europe, and <b>red</b> <b>pine</b> (P.resinosa) and white pine (P.strobus) in North America. An in vitro experiment demonstrated that the species could form an ectomycorrhizal association with Aleppo pine (P.halepensis), a key species used in reforestation in the Mediterranean. A study of the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with a lodgepole pine (P.contorta) invasion front near Coyhaique, Chile, showed that many invasive trees were supported by S.luteus as the sole mycorrhizal partner.|$|E

5|$|Whilst the Mont Blanc massif {{does not}} contain any species that are endemic to it, there are many rare and legally {{protected}} species found within its four major habitat zones. These are the: montane forests, sub-alpine, alpine and nival zones. The major habitats are coniferous forests, moors, rock and talus slopes, plus glacial moraines. The biological richness is further influenced by the {{different aspects of the}} faces, by the geology, and by the influence of man on the lower and middle slopes where forest clearance has created open grassland. The native forest habitats are essential for the survival of many species, with the key conifer species including larch, pine, stone pine and <b>red</b> <b>pine.</b>|$|E
5|$|In nature, Suillus spraguei forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with five-needled pine species. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around {{the roots of}} the trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. S.spraguei produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and rhizomorphs that are tubular fungal cords with a hard outer sheath. The fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate with white pine, a grouping of trees classified in subgenus Strobus of the genus Pinus. However, under controlled pure culture conditions in the laboratory, S.spraguei has also been shown to form associations with <b>Red</b> <b>Pine,</b> Pitch Pine, and Loblolly Pine. Asian populations have been associated with Korean Pine, Chinese White Pine, Siberian Dwarf Pine and Japanese White Pine. In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other boletes, as early as June (bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in July–September), although they may be found as late as October. Mushrooms can be parasitized by the fungus Hypomyces completus. In the asexual stage of H.completus, it appears initially as patches of whitish mold {{on the surface of the}} cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce conidia (asexual spores). In the sexual stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black as it makes perithecia, asci-containing sexual structures that produce ascospores. The perithecia are pimply and give the surface a roughened texture.|$|E

40|$|Red pines Pinus resinosa in Garrett and Allegany counties, Maryland, were {{examined}} during 1982 - 84 to determine {{distribution of the}} pinewood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, within and among trees. Approximately 25 -year-old (younger) and 47 -year-old (older) trees were subdivided into the following categories: 1) trees with mostly green needles; 2) trees with mostly reddish-brown needles; 3) trees lacking needles but with bark intact; 4) trees lacking both needles and bark; and 5) trees with chlorotic, bleached-green needles. Bursaphelenchus xylophilus was found infecting 68 % of younger <b>red</b> <b>pines</b> and 77 % of older <b>red</b> <b>pines.</b> Nematodes were not evenly distributed in trees within any given tree decadence category or in trees of the same age. Nematodes were recovered from 20 % of wood samples from trunks and primary and secondary branches in younger pines and from 15 % of older <b>red</b> <b>pines.</b> On the basis of tree decadence category, the highest incidence of infection in younger trees (31 %) was in bleached-green needled trees (category 5), whereas in older trees the highest infection (25 %) occurred in green needled trees (category 1).

25|$|It is {{commonly}} known as saffron milk-cap, <b>red</b> <b>pine</b> mushroom, or simply pine mushroom in English. An alternate North American name is orange latex milky. Its Spanish name varies (níscalo, nícalo, robellón...). Its Catalan name is rovelló (pl. rovellons). In the Girona area, it is called a pinatell (in Catalan) because it is collected near wild pine trees; it is typically harvested in October following the late August rains. Both this and Lactarius deterrimus are known as Çam melkisi or Çintar in Turkey. In Romania, it is known as Rascovi and it {{can be found in the}} northern regions in autumn season.|$|E
500|$|Foresters {{have raised}} {{concerns}} that the rising serow populations have interfered with post-War mountainside reforestation efforts, as the animal feeds on the saplings of Japanese cypress, Japanese cedar, and Japanese <b>red</b> <b>pine,</b> species with commercial significance. [...] Serow have caused damage to farm crops in mountain villages, and the villagers have objected to conservationists' efforts.

500|$|Paxillus involutus forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} {{with a number}} of coniferous and deciduous tree species. Because the fungus has somewhat unspecialised nutrient requirements and a relatively broad host specificity, it has been frequently used in research and seedling inoculation programs. There is evidence of the benefit to trees of this arrangement: in one experiment where P.involutus was cultivated on the root exudate of <b>red</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus resinosa), the root showed markedly increased resistance to pathogenic strains of the ubiquitous soil fungus Fusarium oxysporum. Seedlings inoculated with P.involutus also showed increased resistance to Fusarium. Thus P.involutus [...] may be producing antifungal compounds which protect the host plants from root rot. Paxillus involutus also decreases the uptake of certain toxic elements, acting as a buffer against heavy metal toxicity in the host plant. For example, the fungus decreased the toxicity of cadmium and zinc to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings: even though cadmium itself inhibits ectomycorrhiza formation in seedlings, colonization with P.involutus decreases cadmium and zinc transport to the plant shoots and alters the ratio of zinc transported to the roots and shoots, causing more cadmium to be retained in the roots of the seedlings rather than distributed through its entire metabolism. Evidence suggests that the mechanism for this detoxification involves the cadmium binding to the fungal cell walls, as well as accumulating in the vacuolar compartments. Further, ectomycorrhizal hyphae exposed to copper or cadmium drastically increase production of a metallothionein—a low molecular weight protein that binds metals.|$|E
500|$|Boletus edulis is mycorrhizal—it is in a mutualistic {{relationship}} with the roots of plants (hosts), in which the fungus exchanges nitrogen and other nutrients extracted from the environment for fixed carbon from the host. Other benefits for the plant are evident: {{in the case of}} the Chinese chestnut, the formation of mycorrhizae with B.edulis increases the ability of plant seedlings to resist water stress, and increases leaf succulence, leaf area, and water-holding ability. The fungus forms a sheath of tissue around terminal, nutrient-absorbing root tips, often inducing a high degree of branching in the tips of the host, and penetrating into the root tissue, forming, to some mycologists, the defining feature of ectomycorrhizal relationships, a hartig net. [...] The ectomycorrhizal fungi are then able to exchange nutrients with the plant, effectively expanding the root system of the host plant to the furthest reaches of the symbiont fungi. Compatible hosts may belong to multiple families of vascular plants that are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere; according to one 1995 estimate, there are at least 30 host plant species distributed over more than 15 genera. Examples of mycorrhizal associates include Chinese <b>red</b> <b>pine,</b> Mexican weeping pine, Scots pine, Norway spruce, Coast Douglas-fir, mountain pine, and Virginia pine. The fungus has also been shown to associate with gum rockrose, a pioneer early stage shrub that is adapted for growth in degraded areas, such as burned forests. These and other rockrose species are ecologically important as fungal reservoirs, maintaining an inoculum of mycorrhizal fungi for trees that appear later in the forest regrowth cycle.|$|E
