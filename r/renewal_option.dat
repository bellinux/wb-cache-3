5|$|A {{legal battle}} that began {{the same year}} {{interfered}} with the band's working on another release. Volcano Entertainment—the successor of Tool's by-then defunct label Zoo Entertainment—alleged contract violations by Tool and filed a lawsuit. According to Volcano, Tool had violated their contract when the band looked at offers from other record labels. After Tool filed a countersuit stating that Volcano had failed to use a <b>renewal</b> <b>option</b> in their contract, the parties settled out of court. In December 1998 Tool agreed to a new contract, a three-record joint venture deal. In 2000, the band dismissed their long-time manager Ted Gardner, who then sued the band over his commission on this lucrative agreement.|$|E

40|$|Based on a {{combined}} register database for Norwegian and Swedish unemployment spells, {{we use the}} ‘between-countries-variation’ in the unemployment insurance systems to identify causal effects. The elasticity of the job hazard rate {{with respect to the}} benefit replacement ratio is around - 1. 0 in Norway and - 0. 5 in Sweden. The limited benefit duration period in Sweden has a large positive impact on the hazard rate, despite generous <b>renewal</b> <b>options</b> through participation in labour market programs. Compulsory program participation seems to operate as a ‘stick’, rather than a ‘carrot’, and is therefore an efficient tool for counteracting moral hazard problems in the benefit system.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the timing of}} replacement of obsolete subsystems within an extensive, complex infrastructure. Such replacement action, known as capital renewal, must balance uncertainty about future profitability against uncertainty about future renewal costs. Treating renewal investments as real options, we derive an optimal solution to the infinite horizon version of this problem and determine the total present value of an institution’s capital <b>renewal</b> <b>options.</b> We investigate {{the sensitivity of the}} infinite horizon solution to variations in key problem parameters and highlight the system scenarios in which timely renewal activity is most profitable. For finite horizon renewal planning, we show that our solution performs better than a policy of constant periodic renewals if more than two renewal cycles are completed...|$|R
