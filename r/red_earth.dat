25|$|Schematically, Oz is {{much like}} the United States, with the Emerald City taking the place of Chicago: to the East, mixed forest and farmland; to the West, {{treeless}} plains and fields of wheat; to the South, warmth and lush growth, and <b>red</b> <b>earth.</b>|$|E
25|$|The largest {{areas of}} fertile soils, called terra roxa (<b>red</b> <b>earth),</b> {{are found in}} the states of Paraná and São Paulo. The least fertile areas are in the Amazon, where the dense {{rainforest}} is. Soils in the Northeast are often fertile, but they lack water, unless they are irrigated artificially.|$|E
25|$|The {{soil of the}} South is made up {{primarily}} of metamorphic rock, particularly gneiss. However, the land is riddled with faults around the border with the Centre Province that arc toward the border with Congo; granite deposits occur along this line. The soil is primarily ferrallitic except for southwestern portions near the border with Equatorial Guinea and moving north to Ebolowa, where it is mixed. Due to high amounts of leaching, the South's <b>red</b> <b>earth</b> is only marginally productive.|$|E

25|$|On August 3, the Government of Alberta {{announced}} an additional $189 million in funding for rebuilding and disaster {{response in the}} Slave Lake area. The funding was allocated to: a regional wildfire recovery plan; a disaster recovery program for the town, the municipal district, the Hamlet of <b>Red</b> <b>Earth</b> Creek, the Gift Lake Metis Settlement, and numerous nearby First Nations reserves; and an interim housing project to accommodate 350 interim homes for displaced residents and families {{of the town and}} the municipal district.|$|E
500|$|Hindu and Buddhist {{influences}} arrived through trade {{contacts with}} the Indian subcontinent. The beginning of the first Millennium saw the rise of ancient Malay states in the coastal areas of Malay peninsular, notably the <b>Red</b> <b>Earth</b> Kingdom (1st century), Gangga Negara (2nd century), Langkasuka (2nd century), [...] Kedah (2nd century) and Pahang (5th century).

500|$|Like Antichrist Superstar before it, Holy Wood uses a song cycle structure, {{dividing}} the album into four movements. These movements are titled A: In the Shadow, D: The Androgyne, A: Of <b>Red</b> <b>Earth,</b> and M: The Fallen. Manson described the record as [...] "the final {{piece of a}} triptych that I began with Antichrist Superstar." [...] Despite being {{the last of the}} three albums to be released, Manson explained that the triptych's storyline takes place in reverse chronological order; Holy Wood began the story, and Mechanical Animals and Antichrist Superstar were sequels. The storyline unfolds in a multi-tiered series of metaphors and allusions; for example, the album's title refers not only to the Hollywood Sign, but also to [...] "the tree of knowledge that Adam took the first fruit from when he fell out of paradise, the wood that Christ was crucified on, the wood that [...] Oswald's rifle is made from, and the wood that so many coffins are made of." ...|$|E
30|$|The geology of the Olusosun area is {{generally}} characterized by Coastal Plain Sands. It forms low lying, gently sloping topography with extensive <b>red</b> <b>earths</b> and loose poorly sorted sands that {{are mixed with}} an abundance of clays.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to the drapery and sky areas, Van Dyck is known to model flesh tones in successive layers while the paint was still wet, resulting in a single but rather thick paint layer [16, 29, 30]. According to previous research, he implemented a different approach for male and women figures. The luminous pinkish tones of female and infant flesh were composed of lead white, lightly tinted with vermilion and <b>red</b> <b>earths</b> in shadow areas. The darker flesh of the male characters was based on vermilion, while lead white, carbon black, calcite, gypsum, brown and/or <b>red</b> <b>earths</b> were added, depending on the required luminosity. The Fe, Hg, Ca and Pb distribution maps of the MA-XRF scanning indicated the presence of similar pigments in the flesh tones of the disputed painting, i.e. calcium, <b>red</b> <b>earths,</b> vermilion and lead white. The element Ca (Fig.  6 g) was mostly present in the shadow areas along with Fe (Fig.  6 c), while the light painted areas are comparable richer in Hg (Fig.  6 d) and Pb (Fig.  5 b). The carnation colors of the angel and Saint Jerome differ in tone, a difference that is reflected in these chemical images as well. The flesh tones of Saint Jerome comprised higher amounts of Fe than {{the skin of the}} angel, where the element was only present in the deepest shadows of the face, neck and right arm. The Mn distribution map also indicated that this element is present in the dark shadows of the Saint’s skin. The highlights in the Hg map, on the other hand, corresponded to the red paint areas of the angel’s skin and only very small areas of the Saint’s flesh. Hence, similar to Van Dyck’s working method, it seemed that the variation in tonality mainly depended on the ratio of Pb, Ca, Hg and Fe present in the flesh tones. SEM-EDX analysis of a cross-section removed from the Saint’s left foot (S 1) confirmed the presence of these elements in stratigraphy of the old man’s flesh paint.|$|R

2500|$|Away {{from the}} river Hay is {{surrounded}} by flat, mostly-treeless plains, predominately of grey clay and <b>red</b> <b>earth</b> soils. [...] Saltbush shrublands (Atriplex sp.), with an understorey of grasses and forbs, was the dominant plant community {{at the time of}} European settlement. [...] However severe depletion of the saltbush has occurred after years of overstocking, damage by rabbits and the broad-scale agriculture of recent decades, particularly in areas along the river and proximate to irrigation canals. The plains surrounding Hay feature a complex system of shallow creek beds and dry lakes, interspersed by wind-created sand-ridges where Cypress-pine (Callitris sp.) is often found growing.|$|E
30|$|The {{landscape}} of the region is undulating, with soils formed on basalt residuum, Tertiary sediments, or on the alluvial plains associated with rivers and streams. The soils formed on the recent alluvial plains are cracking clay soils (Vertisols) or what are locally known as duplex soils (Ultisols possibly in the US soil taxonomic system). On the older alluvium and basalt, cracking clay soils predominate. The soils formed on tertiary sediments are <b>red</b> <b>earths</b> on the crests (Oxisols?) and duplex and gradational soils (Inceptisols) on the lower slopes (Tucker et al. 2003).|$|R
50|$|Confined to regions between 550 and 200 mm annual rainfall, A. cambagei {{is found}} {{primarily}} on flat and gently undulating terrain on heavy and relatively fertile clay and clay-loam soils {{in the eastern}} part of it range, and often forms mixed communities with brigalow which favours the same soil types. In drier regions, gidgee is found primarily on <b>red</b> <b>earths</b> and loams in wetter depression and low-relief areas. Gidgee communities are floristically similar to brigalow communities. Eucalyptus cambageana, E. populnea, Corymbia terminalis, Eremophila mitchellii and Geijera parviflora are typical woody species associated with gidgee communities.|$|R

50|$|The {{biosphere}} reserve {{was described by}} UNESCO in 2016 as:Located in Southeast Australia, the Barkindji Biosphere Reserve lies within the largest river basin of Australia — the Murray-Darling Basin. Eleven land systems spread across dunes, sand plains, wetlands, floodplains and along the Murray River characterize the topography of the reserve. Subdued mountain ranges surround Barkindji, except for the southwestern area. In addition, a rich variability in soils can be found within the reserve: <b>red</b> <b>earths,</b> grey and brown clays, and calcareous and siliceous sands represent just a few examples. Moreover, sudden changes from wetland to shrubland and semi-arid forest highlight Barkindji’s diversity of soils and habitats.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the basin}} of the Warrego is too dry for {{cropping}} and has a very erratic rainfall of between 350 and 500 mm. It {{is covered with a}} natural vegetation of grassland of more fertile clay soils, and saltbush shrubland on less fertile <b>red</b> <b>earths.</b> The predominant land use is low-intensity grazing of sheep and cattle: the river's flow is much too erratic to permit irrigated cropping. The Warrego is essentially an ephemeral stream: it is not unknown for years to pass without any flow in the basin and substantial amounts of water reach the Darling River only in wet years almost always associated with La Niña events.|$|R
2500|$|The name Pomo {{derives from}} a {{conflation}} of the Pomo words [...] and [...] It originally meant [...] "those who live at <b>red</b> <b>earth</b> hole" [...] and {{was once the}} name of a village in southern Potter Valley near the present-day community of Pomo. [...] It may have referred to local deposits of the red mineral magnesite, used for red beads, or to the reddish earth and clay, such as hematite, mined in the area. In the Northern Pomo dialect, -pomo or -poma was used as a suffix after the names of places, to mean a subgroup of people of the place. By the year 1877 (possibly beginning with Powers), the use of Pomo had been extended in English to mean the entire people known today as the Pomo. The Pomo had 20 chiefs at the same time.|$|E
