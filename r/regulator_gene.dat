25|$|In {{negative}} repressible operons, transcription of the operon normally takes place. Repressor proteins {{are produced}} by a <b>regulator</b> <b>gene,</b> but {{they are unable to}} bind to the operator in their normal conformation. However, certain molecules called corepressors are bound by the repressor protein, causing a conformational change to the active site. The activated repressor protein binds to the operator and prevents transcription. The trp operon, involved in the synthesis of tryptophan (which itself acts as the corepressor), is a negatively controlled repressible operon.|$|E
25|$|The sex {{chromosomes}} {{of birds}} evolved separately {{from those of}} mammals and share very little sequence homology with the XY chromosomes. As such, scientists refer to bird sex chromosomes as a ZW sex-determining system, with males possessing two Z chromosomes, and females possessing one Z chromosome and one W. Thus, dosage compensation in birds could be hypothesized to follow a pattern similar to the random X-inactivation observed in most mammals. Alternatively, birds might show decreased transcription of the two Z chromosomes present in the male heterogametic sex, similar to the system observed in the two male X chromosomes of Drosophila. However, bird mechanisms of dosage compensation differ significantly from these precedents. Instead, male birds appear to selectively silence only a few genes along one of their Z chromosomes, rather than randomly silencing one entire Z chromosome. This type of selective silencing has led some people to label birds as “less effective” at dosage compensation than mammals. However, more {{recent studies have shown}} that those genes on the Z chromosome which are not inactivated in birds may {{play an important role in}} recruiting dosage compensation machinery to the Z chromosome in ZZ organisms. In particular, one of these genes, ScII has been demonstrated to be an ortholog of xol-1, the master sex <b>regulator</b> <b>gene</b> in C. elegans. Thus, the function of the selective silencing may be to spare dosage compensation of genes crucial for sex determination of homologous pairing.|$|E

5000|$|In prokaryotes, <b>regulator</b> <b>genes</b> often {{code for}} {{repressor}} proteins. Repressor proteins bind to operators or promoters, preventing RNA polymerase from transcribing RNA. They are usually constantly expressed so the cell {{always has a}} supply of repressor molecules on hand.

50|$|A <b>regulator</b> <b>gene,</b> regulator, or {{regulatory}} gene is a gene involved in controlling {{the expression of}} one or more other genes. Regulatory sequences, which encode {{regulatory gene}}s, are often 5' to the start site of transcription of the gene they regulate. In addition, these sequences can also be found 3' to the transcription start site. In both cases, whether the regulatory sequence occurs before (5') or after (3') the gene it regulates, the sequence is often many kilobases away from the transcription start site. A <b>regulator</b> <b>gene</b> may encode a protein, or it may work at the level of RNA, {{as in the case of}} genes encoding microRNAs. An example of a <b>regulator</b> <b>gene</b> is a gene that codes for a repressor protein that inhibits the activity of an operator gene (a gene which binds repressor proteins thus inhibiting the translation of RNA to protein via RNA polymerase).|$|E

40|$|Recovering gene {{regulatory}} networks from expression data is {{a challenging}} problem in systems biology that provides valuable {{information on the}} regulatory mechanisms of cells. A number of algorithms based on computational models are currently used to recover network topology. However, most of these algorithms have limitations. For example, many models tend to be complicated because of the "large p, small n" problem. In this paper, we propose a novel regulatory network inference method called the maximum-relevance and maximum-significance network (MRMSn) method, which converts the problem of recovering networks into a {{problem of how to}} select the <b>regulator</b> <b>genes</b> for each gene. To solve the latter problem, we present an algorithm that is based on information theory and selects the <b>regulator</b> <b>genes</b> for a specific gene by maximizing the relevance and significance. A first-order incremental search algorithm is used to search for <b>regulator</b> <b>genes.</b> Eventually, a strict constraint is adopted to adjust all of the regulatory relationships according to the obtained <b>regulator</b> <b>genes</b> and thus obtain the complete network structure.

40|$|Cellular phenotypes are {{determined}} by the dynamical activity of networks of co-regulated genes. Elucidating such networks is crucial for the understanding of normal cell physiology {{as well as for the}} dissection of complex pathologic phenotypes. Existing methods for such "reverse engineering" of genetic networks from microarray expression data have been successful only in prokaryotes (E. coli) and lower eukaryotes (S. cerevisiae) with relatively simple genomes. Additionally, they have mostly attempted to reconstruct average properties about the network connectivity without capturing the highly conditional nature of the interactions. In this paper we extend the ARACNE algorithm, which we recently introduced and successfully applied to the reconstruction of whole-genome transcriptional networks from mammalian cells, precisely to link the existence of specific network structures to the expression or lack thereof of specific <b>regulator</b> <b>genes.</b> This is accomplished by analyzing thousands of alternative network topologies generated by constraining the data set on the presence or absence of putative <b>regulator</b> <b>genes.</b> By considering interactions that are consistently supported across several such constraints, we identify many transcriptional interactions that would not have been detectable by the original method. By selecting genes that produce statistically significant changes in network topology, we identify novel candidate <b>regulator</b> <b>genes.</b> Further analysis shows that transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases, and other gene families known to effect biochemical interactions, are significantly overrepresented among the set of candidate <b>regulator</b> <b>genes</b> identified in silico, indirectly supporting the validity of the approach.

30|$|Preformed {{defense systems}} likely {{play a role}} in basal {{resistance}} in limiting the growth of a normally virulent pathogen. Preformed or constitutive defense systems involve cuticle (Skamnioti and Gurr 2007) and cell wall (Juge 2006) strengthening. In rice, like in other plants, silicon accumulation plays direct and indirect roles in basal resistance (Ma and Yamaji 2006). Antimicrobial molecules, called phytoanticipins, can also accumulate before infection (Morrissey and Osbourn 1999). Increasing information from Arabidopsis and other plants indicates that the overproduction of PR proteins confers resistance, that mutations in <b>regulator</b> <b>genes</b> negatively regulating disease resistance can increase defense gene expression (e.g. Noutoshi et al. 2005; Petersen et al. 2000), or that over-expression of <b>regulator</b> <b>genes</b> acting positively on disease resistance can increase defense gene expression (Hammond-Kosack and Parker 2003).|$|R

Although this anatomy was first described in 1882, the genetic regulators controlling Kranz development are still not known. In recent years, transcriptomic analysis has allowed researchers to identify candidate Kranz <b>regulator</b> <b>genes,</b> and a model for Kranz development has been proposed, however, this model has not been experimentally validated.
