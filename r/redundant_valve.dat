40|$|Shutoff valve and {{actuation}} system concepts {{that are most}} suitable for the Orbital Maneuvering Systems engine application were determined. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} ten year and 100 mission life requirement, propellant and propellant residue compatibility and weight. It was found that poppet or ball valves utilizing electric or electropneumatic actuation were most applicable. Preliminary design layouts of a number of valve and actuation concepts were prepared and analyzed to make the optimum concept selection. Pneumatic {{actuation system}}s were required to feature their own pneumatic supply so that for the quad <b>redundant</b> <b>valve,</b> it was necessary to include two pneumatic supply systems, one for each of the series legs of the quad redundant package. The requirement for the pneumatic package placed heavy reliability, weight, and maintenance penalties upon electropneumatic actuation systems. The two valve and actuation systems concepts selected featured electric torque motor operation and a poppet as well as a ball valve concept with a retractable seal...|$|E
40|$|Following {{incidents}} at Pickering, Wolsung and Bruce NGS, involving {{instability of}} bleed condenser re-lief valves, Darlington station decided {{to replace the}} spring loaded RVs by new pilot operated SEBIM tandem valves. This paper is presenting the approach taken, the design and the testing of the new so-lution, {{as well as some}} of the computer modeling work performed in connection with this project. The SEBIM tandems, following successful testing in France, will bee installed in Darlington Unit 2, this spring. The new valves can perform with absence of instability and prevent a LOCA incident due to their design, which includes a protection and a <b>redundant</b> <b>valve</b> in series. Theoretical studies (Ref. 1) as well as the Pickering, Wolsung and Bruce incidents outlined the prob-lems associated with bleed condenser (BC) relief valve operation in some of the CANDU reactors. In all cases, the opening of the spring loaded valves, designed to provide overpressure protection for the BC vessel as well as for the primary heat transport system (PHT), was due to a liquid relief valve (LRV...|$|E
50|$|During the {{retrieval}} of the Lunar Module (LM) from its stowed position below the Command/Service Module (CSM), a {{light came on}} on the control panel that indicated the valves of the Service Propulsion System were open and the engine should be firing. A short {{was found in a}} switch that controlled the <b>redundant</b> <b>valves</b> for the engine. New procedures were developed to deal with this. During their first inspection of the LM, Scott and Irwin found that the glass cover of a tapemeter had broken forcing them to clean up the glass shards lest they breathe them in.|$|R

The primary change to the propulsion system to provide three-burn capability was the addition of radiation shielding to the propellant duct. The <b>redundant</b> <b>valves</b> and feed paths {{were added to the}} H 202 supply and reaction control system to increase system tolerance to the most probable causes of failure. Other changes were made to enhance mission capability of the Centaur, and represent an increase in inherent reliability of the vehicle through reduction of single failure points and by substitution of more reliable components...|$|R

40|$|Two-dimensional echocardiograms and angiocardiograms were {{obtained}} in six infants and children, each with complete transposition {{of the great}} arteries, a ventricular septal defect and subvalvular pulmonary stenosis. In each case, the subpulmonary stenosis resulted from <b>redundant</b> tricuspid <b>valve</b> tissue which protruded through the ventricular septal defect and into the left ventricular outflow tract. Angio-echocardiographic correlations demonstrated features that allowed preoperative recognition of this unusual type of subpulmonary stenosis. The left ventricular angiogram in an anteroposterior orientation revealed a characteristic filling defect in the outflow tract during systole in each patient. Echocardiographic images of the left ventricular outflow tract and of the tricuspid valve demonstrated subpulmonary stenosis caused by protruding <b>redundant</b> tricuspid <b>valve</b> tissue (resembling a “pouch”) in all six patients. These findings were contrasted with those from three patients with normally related great arteries and a similar, but nonobstructive, tricuspid valve pouch. Echocardiographic and angiocardiographic examination and correlation allowed preoperative diagnosis of this unusual form of subpulmonary stenosis in complete transposition of the great arteries. This is especially important because limited left ventricular intraoperative exploration may fail to reveal subpulmonary obstruction as the pouch may be flaccid in a relaxed arrested heart...|$|R
50|$|A {{conservatively}} designed autoclave {{has multiple}} safety valves which are each sized {{to be able}} to cope with the greatest available airflow into the vessel plus not less than 30%. The valves are mounted on a manifold that allows multiple pressure vessel outlets to feed multiple safety valves, each one of which can handle the entire air dump by itself, even if one pressure vessel outlet is accidentally blocked by debris from an internal failure. The added cost of the <b>redundant</b> safety <b>valves</b> is approximately one tenth of one percent of the machine price.|$|R

During the run phases,radioactive gas, mainly composed of hydrogen, will be extracted from the vacuumchambers. The radioactive gas storage system function is to prevent any uncontrolledrelease of activated gas by storing it in gas tank during the radioactive decay,while monitoring the hydrogen rate in the tanks under a threshold. This confinementof radioactive materials is a safety function. The filling and the dischargeof the tanks are processed with monostable valves, making the storage a passivesafety system. Two separate redundant control subsystems, based on electricalhardware technologies, allow {{the opening of the}} <b>redundant</b> safety <b>valves,</b> accordingto <b>redundant</b> pressure captors, redundant di-hydrogen rate analyzers and limitswitches of the valves.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the design of <b>redundant</b> {{metering}} <b>valves</b> for mechanically signalled hydraulic actuators. The final aim {{of the work is}} to manufacture a new low-cost valve in replacement of the existing expensive valve with an additional leakage requirement in case of seizure. The new valve must ensure the same closed-loop behaviour of the actuator. The article presents the design of the valve according to the actuator specifications and to a criterion of mixability (capacity to replace the existing valve by a new one). The valve pre-design is based on the common sharp edges and rectangular orifice slots combined with a serial restrictor inserted on the supply line. After partial experimental validation, the proposed design process points out the interest of using a trapezoidal slot {{in order to get the}} required speed gain over the whole valve opening range. The proposal is validated through the experimental measurement of the actuator no-load speed as a function of the valve opening...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Patients with {{symptoms}} of cerebral ischemia are often evaluated with non-invasive carotid artery testing. An abnormal carotid Doppler ultrasound frequency shift pattern of early systolic flutter (ESF) was demonstrated by auscultation and velocity wave form analysis {{in patients with}} normal carotid bifurcations. Ten of these patients were studied with echocardiography (echo) and eight had mitral valve prolapse (MVP). To evaluate the association between ESF and MVP, a prospective blinded study was performed, recording carotid Dopple frequency shift in 50 patients referred for routine echocardiography. A total of 18 patients had ESF: 9 / 12 patients with MVP by echocardiography had ESF. Nine additional patients without MVP had ESF (two with mitral regurgitation and two with <b>redundant</b> mitral <b>valves).</b> The association of ESF with MVP was significant (p < 0. 001). The findings of ESF with a normal carotid artery by non-invasive testing suggests a possible mitral valve origin for symptoms of cerebrovascular disease...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{pressure}} cookers {{typically have}} two or three <b>redundant</b> safety <b>valves</b> and additional safety features, such as an interlock lid that prevents the user from opening the lid when the internal pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure, preventing accidents from a sudden release of hot liquid, steam and food. If safety mechanisms are not correctly in place, the cooker will not pressurize the contents. Pressure cookers should be operated only after reading the instruction manual, to ensure correct usage. Pressure cooker failure is dangerous: a large quantity of scalding steam and water will be forcefully ejected and if the lid separates it may be propelled with considerable force. Some cookers with an internally fitted lid may be particularly dangerous upon failure as the lid fits tighter with increasing pressure, preventing the lid from deforming and venting around the edges. Due to these dangers pressure cookers are generally over-engineered in a safety regard and some countries even have regulations to prevent the sale of non-compliant cookers.|$|R
40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the left {{atrioventricular}} valve, a mitral valve unless there is atrioventricular discordance, was determined by cross sectional echocardiography in 15 young patients with congenital lesions and seven with rheumatic lesions. These results were compared with findings at operation. The preoperative diagnosis was accurate in 18 (80 %). In the remaining four patients inaccurate echocardiographic diagnosis {{was due to the}} mistaken identification of clefts in <b>redundant</b> and multicuspid <b>valves</b> and of absent chordae that were thought to be ruptured chordae. In four patients a subvalvar abnormality was identified by echocardiography. With care, cross sectional echocardiography was a reliable method of defining abnormal anatomy in serious mitral disease and it predicted the need for replacement or the possibility of repair. In the absence of additional lesions invasive investigation was unnecessary...|$|R
5000|$|Surgical septal myectomy is an open-heart {{operation}} done {{to relieve}} symptoms {{in patients who}} remain severely symptomatic despite medical therapy. It has been performed successfully since the early 1960s. Surgical septal myectomy uniformly decreases left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and improves symptoms, and in experienced centers has a surgical mortality of less than 1%, as well as 85% success rate. [...] It involves a median sternotomy (general anesthesia, opening the chest, and cardiopulmonary bypass) and removing {{a portion of the}} interventricular septum. Surgical myectomy resection that focuses just on the subaortic septum, to increase the size of the outflow tract to reduce Venturi forces, may be inadequate to abolish systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. With this limited resection, the residual mid-septal bulge still redirects flow posteriorly; SAM persists because flow still gets behind the mitral valve. It is only when the deeper portion of the septal bulge is resected that flow is redirected anteriorly away from the mitral valve, abolishing SAM. With this in mind, a modification of the Morrow myectomy termed extended myectomy, mobilization and partial excision of the papillary muscles has become the excision of choice. In selected patients with particularly large <b>redundant</b> mitral <b>valves,</b> anterior leaflet plication may be added to complete separation of the mitral valve and outflow. Complications of septal myectomy surgery include possible death, arrhythmias, infection, incessant bleeding, septal perforation/defect, stroke.|$|R

40|$|Direct cycle {{boiling water}} reactor (BWR) plants have <b>redundant</b> quick-acting isola-tion <b>valves</b> on each main steam line from the reactor to the turbine. In {{the event of a}} loss-of-coolant {{accident}} (LOCA), any leakage of contaminated steam through these valves is controlled by a leakage control system. The leakage control system must satisfy the requirements of General Design Criteria 2, 4, and 54. The review of the main steam isolation valve leakage control system (MSIVLCS) covers the entire leakage control system including the source of the sealing medium, if any, and pumps, valves, and piping to the points of connection or interface with the main steam supply system. Emphasis is placed on the components of the leakage control system that are required to remain functional following a design basis LOCA. 1. ASB reviews the design of the MSIVLCS and essential subsystems to assure their ability to function following a postulated LOCA including the loss-. of offsite power. The system is reviewed to determine that: a. A malfunction or failure of an active component of the system, or loss of the source of sealing fluid, if any, will not impair the functional j performance of the system. b. The failure of nonseismic Category I equipment or components will not have an adverse effect on the ability of the system or components to function. c. The capability of the system to perform its intended safety function is maintained assuming a single active failure of a main steam line isola-tion valve...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is {{responsible}} for ensuring the safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operation of the nation's natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. Regulations adopted by PHMSA for gas pipelines are provided in 49 CFR 192, and spacing requirements for valves in gas transmission pipelines are presented in 49 CFR 192. 179. The present report describes {{the findings of a}} scoping study conducted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to assist PHMSA in assessing the safety impact of system valve spacing. Calculations of the pressures, temperatures, and flow velocities during a set of representative pipe depressurization transients were carried out using a one-dimensional numerical model with either ideal gas or real gas properties for the fluid. With both ideal gas and real gas properties, the high-consequence area radius for any resulting fire as defined by Stevens in GRI- 00 / 0189 was evaluated as one measure of the pipeline safety. In the real gas case, a model for convective heat transfer from the pipe wall is included to assess the potential for shut-off valve failures due to excessively low temperatures resulting from depressurization cooling of the pipe. A discussion is also provided of some additional factors by which system valve spacing could affect overall pipeline safety. The following conclusions can be drawn from this work: (1) Using an adaptation of the Stephens hazard radius criteria, valve spacing has a negligible influence on natural gas pipeline safety for the pipeline diameter, pressure range, and valve spacings considered in this study. (2) Over the first 30 s of the transient, pipeline pressure has a far greater effect on the hazard radius calculated with the Stephens criteria than any variations in the transient flow decay profile and the average discharge rate. (3) Other factors besides the Stephens criteria, such as the longer burn time for an accidental fire, greater period of danger to emergency personnel, increased unavoidable loss of gas, and possible depressurization cooling of the shut-off valves may also be important when deciding whether a change in the required valve spacing would be beneficial from a safety standpoint. (4) The average normalized discharge rate of {lambda}{sub avg} = 0. 33 assumed by Stephens in developing his safety criteria is an excellent conservative value for natural gas discharge at the pressures, valve spacings, and pipe diameter used in this study. This conclusion remains valid even when real rather than ideal gas properties are considered in the analysis. (5) Significant pipe wall cooling effects (T{sub w} < - 50 F or 228 K) can extend for a mile or more upstream from the rupture point within 30 s of a break. These conditions are colder than the temperature range specifications for many valve lubricants. The length of the low-temperature zone due to this cooling effect is also essentially independent of the system shut-off valve spacing or the distance between the break and a compressor station. (6) Having more <b>redundant</b> shut-off <b>valves</b> available would reduce the probability that pipe cooling effects could interfere with isolating the broken area following a pipeline rupture accident...|$|R
