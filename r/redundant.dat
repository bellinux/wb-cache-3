5|$|Another <b>redundant</b> Leda-class frigate, HMS Hamadryad, {{was also}} moored in Cardiff {{and used as}} a {{hospital}} ship from 1866 to 1905.|$|E
5|$|The 747 has <b>redundant</b> {{structures}} {{along with}} four <b>redundant</b> hydraulic systems and four main landing gears with four wheels each, which {{provide a good}} spread of support {{on the ground and}} safety in case of tire blow-outs. The main gear are <b>redundant</b> so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing gears if the others do not function properly. In addition, the 747 has split control surfaces and was designed with sophisticated triple-slotted flaps that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standard-length runways. For transportation of spare engines, 747s can accommodate a non-functioning fifth-pod engine under the port wing of the aircraft between the inner functioning engine and the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The two initial, primary {{computers}} on the HST {{were the}} 1.25MHz DF-224 system, built by Rockwell Autonetics, which contained three <b>redundant</b> CPUs, and two <b>redundant</b> NSSC-1 (NASA Standard Spacecraft Computer, Model 1) systems, developed by Westinghouse and GSFC using diode-transistor logic (DTL). A co-processor for the DF-224 was added during Servicing Mission 1 in 1993, {{which consisted of}} two <b>redundant</b> strings of an Intel-based 80386 processor with an 80387 math co-processor. The DF-224 and its 386 co-processor were replaced by a 25MHz Intel-based 80486 processor system during Servicing Mission 3A in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Holy Trinity is now <b>redundant</b> {{and is in}} {{the care}} of the Churches Conservation Trust, the only one of Sharpe's churches to be so preserved.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 {{the system}} was {{extended}} to include a battery bank charged by two photovoltaic solar arrays, and by a 6kW wind turbine sited at a <b>redundant</b> telecommunications tower on {{the high point of}} the island.|$|E
5|$|Such {{plans are}} subject to {{approval}} by the Buenos Aires City Legislature and would mean the annulment {{of many of the}} current expansion plans outlined in Law 670. Some criticisms include the failure of the Peters plan to account for the extension of the Belgrano Sur Line to Constitucion railway station, meaning that Line C's extension to the minor Buenos Aires terminal would be <b>redundant,</b> and that the Retiro Norte node would also be made <b>redundant</b> by the planned Red de Expresos Regionales commuter rail tunnels which are to link the three major railway terminals of the city.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland's {{official}} nickname is 'The Black Cats'. The previous nickname, 'The Rokerites', {{was made}} <b>redundant</b> after the club left Roker Park for the Stadium of Light in 1997. The new name was decided upon {{in a public}} vote that year.|$|E
5|$|The breaker (Channel 1 Aerosurfaces, ASA 1) {{is part of}} the shuttle's Flight Control Systems (FCS), a {{subsystem}} of the guidance, navigation, {{and control}} (GNC) systems. The failure would have no impact to the mission, due to <b>redundant</b> systems.|$|E
5|$|The murage loft in the market, <b>redundant</b> {{since the}} {{completion}} of the city walls, took over the functions of the old tollhouse and became the offices of the market supervisor and the collection office for market tolls and taxes.|$|E
5|$|The reservoir, {{which forms}} {{part of the}} Nant Fawr corridor, has been <b>redundant</b> since the 1970s and has only been used for leisure {{purposes}} and for 'topping up' the adjacent Lisvane Reservoir.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the UK in early 1946, Indefatigable was modified for transport duties, and ferried troops and civilians {{for the rest of}} the year before she was reduced to reserve. She was recommissioned in 1950 as a training ship for service with the Home Fleet Training Squadron, participating in exercises and making several port visits overseas. The Board of Admiralty decided that she was <b>redundant</b> in early 1954 and decommissioned her later that year. Indefatigable was sold for scrap the following year.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many species}} have been named, modern paleontologists {{recognize}} only one, T. bataar, as valid. Some experts see this species as an Asian representative of the North American genus Tyrannosaurus; this would make the genus Tarbosaurus <b>redundant.</b> Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, if not synonymous, {{are considered to be}} at least closely related genera. Alioramus, also from Mongolia, is thought by some authorities to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a 2006 {{settlement}} of a lawsuit filed by the Boston Center for Independent Living and a group of individuals, the MBTA installed additional elevators at Porter and four other busy MBTA subway stations. The elevator to the Red Line was out of service for 15 months beginning in March 2011 for car replacement and the installation of a second, <b>redundant,</b> elevator. An accessible shuttle bus ran between Porter and Davis.|$|E
5|$|C# {{provides}} properties as syntactic sugar for {{a common}} pattern in which a pair of methods, accessor (getter) and mutator (setter) encapsulate operations on a single attribute of a class. No <b>redundant</b> method signatures for the getter/setter implementations need be written, and the property may be accessed using attribute syntax rather than more verbose method calls.|$|E
5|$|During 2010 Michael Eavis {{received}} a donation from British Waterways of timber {{from the old}} gates at Caen Hill Locks in Wiltshire. This was used to construct a new bridge which was dedicated {{to the memory of}} Arabella Churchill. The following year more of the <b>redundant</b> lock gates were used to build the Campo Pequeno amphitheatre.|$|E
5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a main engine controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of valves) and monitors its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two <b>redundant</b> Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly <b>redundant</b> Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E
5|$|Following the Marquess' death, {{his agent}} {{hoped that the}} story {{would serve as a}} warning over the dangers of drug addiction. Ickworth Church, which the 7th Marquess had bought in 1986 after commissioners {{declared}} it <b>redundant,</b> was inherited by the 8th Marquess and restored with a Heritage Lottery grant. The East Wing of Ickworth House was converted by the National Trust into a luxury hotel in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Arlington Line, which was built several miles to the southwest of Fort Jackson, atop the heights of Arlington, the maintenance of Forts Jackson and Runyon was neglected. The two forts had largely been made <b>redundant</b> by the newer, stronger works atop the hills, and it was believed that neither played a crucial role any longer in the defenses of Washington. Fort Jackson was kept in service only as an inspection station for traffic crossing Long Bridge.|$|E
5|$|If {{dropping}} {{the requirement for}} {{the uniqueness of the}} solution, 41-clue minimal pseudo-puzzles are known to exist, but they can be completed to more than one solution grid. Removal of any clue increases the number of the completions and from this perspective none of the 41 clues is <b>redundant.</b> With slightly more than half the grid filled with givens (41 of 81 cells), the uniqueness of the solution constraint still dominates over the minimality constraint.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, in {{the lead}} up to Manchester hosting the Commonwealth Games, a {{requirement}} to increase capacity on for the event led to Metrolink investigating the purchase of <b>redundant</b> second-hand USSLRV vehicles from the Muni Metro system in San Francisco. To this end, two were procured for testing and shipped to the UK, with one taken to Metrolink's Queen's Road depot. In the end, the proposal was not taken forward as the vehicles {{were found to be}} unsuitable for use in the UK.|$|E
5|$|In the Northover {{district}} {{industrial production}} of sheepskins, woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes, developed {{in conjunction with}} the growth of C Clark in Street. Clarks still has its headquarters in Street, but shoes are no longer manufactured there. Instead, in 1993, <b>redundant</b> factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Major {{numbering}} changes {{started in}} the 1960s as Michigan retired or rerouted its US Highways with the completion of Interstates. US12 replaced US112 in 1962 when the I-94 designation supplanted most of the original US12. Later that year, US16 was decommissioned in favor of I-96. This trend continued into the 1970s when US25 was decommissioned as <b>redundant</b> to sections of I-75 and I-94.|$|E
5|$|Minnie Island State Park offers {{opportunities}} for picnicking and fishing to visitors who reach it by boat. Though the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection lists boating as an activity, which is <b>redundant</b> because {{the island is}} accessible by boat. The Oh Ranger website advises visitors of the tiny island to use a kayak to access the island because the island is heavily wooded {{and it is difficult}} to find a spot to dock.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the sheep}} meat {{exported}} from Australia is either frozen carcases to the UK or is live export to the Middle East for halal slaughter. PETA has stated that sheep exported to countries outside the jurisdiction of Australia's animal cruelty laws are treated inhumanely and that halal meat processing facilities exist in Australia, making the export of live animals <b>redundant.</b> Entertainer Pink has pledged to boycott all Australian sheep products in protest.|$|E
5|$|Norton {{recommends}} disabling the Windows Firewall {{to avoid}} <b>redundant</b> alerts. The firewall stealthed all significant ports in PC Magazine testing. Attacking the firewall itself was unsuccessful, and PC Magazine {{was unable to}} stop its service, terminate its process, or disable the firewall using simulated mouse clicks. The firewall also passed PC Pros tests, successfully stealthing all ports.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 2008, the Council {{announced}} that some staff would be offered voluntary redundancies {{as part of}} a strategy to address the $7.1 million deficit it faced for the 2008–2009 financial year without increasing Council rates. The following day, it set a deadline of 19 January 2009 and clarified that 27 positions were being made <b>redundant,</b> while 29 vacancies would not be filled. The redundancies proceeded as planned, although forced redundancies down the track were not ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Parker and Stone {{were very}} happy with the episode, but {{received}} feedback from fans {{that it was one of}} the weaker episodes of the first season, and that the constant jokes about Barbra Streisand started to grow <b>redundant.</b> Many fans also did not like Kenny's tether ball accident death scene because it had nothing to do with the plot of the episode, which Parker and Stone said was supposed to be the joke.|$|E
5|$|Past {{servicing}} missions have exchanged old {{instruments for}} new ones, both avoiding failure and making possible {{new types of}} science. Without servicing missions, all of the instruments will eventually fail. In August 2004, the power system of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) failed, rendering the instrument inoperable. The electronics had originally been fully <b>redundant,</b> but {{the first set of}} electronics failed in May 2001. This power supply was fixed during Servicing Mission 4 in May 2009.|$|E
5|$|<b>Redundant</b> {{staff members}} are often laid off {{as part of}} the {{consolidation}} process, and the sharing of news content reduces the number of unique editorial voices in the market. This in particular is one of the caveats of pushes to ban outsourcing agreements by media consolidation critics, who also suggest that LMAs result in a decreased amount of local news coverage on the brokered station.|$|E
5|$|Rocket {{remained}} in {{use with the}} L after the accident, albeit rarely used for anything other than internal engineering duties. The more advanced Planet design was better suited to heavy loads, and Rocket became <b>redundant.</b> In 1834 it was used for experiments with new drive systems, after which it was put in storage. In 1836 it was sold to the Midgeholme Colliery, and used to haul coal until 1844.|$|E
5|$|The 1930s {{improvements}} {{included the}} construction of the Prescott Channel, designed to allow flood water to bypass the Three Mills tide mills. The channel included sluices to regulate water levels above it, but these became <b>redundant</b> once the tide mills ceased to operate, and eventually seized up. They were removed soon after parts of the Channelsea River were culverted.|$|E
5|$|The 767 is {{equipped}} with three <b>redundant</b> hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A ram air turbine provides power for basic controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers.|$|E
5|$|The US Army's next {{generation}} Chinook, the CH-47D, entered service in 1982. Improvements from the CH-47C included upgraded engines, composite rotor blades, a redesigned cockpit to reduce pilot workload, <b>redundant</b> and improved electrical systems, an advanced {{flight control system}} (FCS) and improved avionics. The RAF returned their original Mk1s to Boeing for upgrading to CH-47D standard, {{the first of which}} returned to the UK in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} model {{proposed for}} the evolution of circular permutations is the permutation by duplication mechanism. In this model, a precursor gene first undergoes a duplication and fusion to form a large tandem repeat. Next, start and stop codons are introduced at corresponding locations in the duplicated gene, removing <b>redundant</b> sections of the protein.|$|E
5|$|The eastern (Chatham) side, {{comprising}} platforms 1–8, is the terminus for Southeastern {{services to}} Kent on the Chatham Main Line and its branches. This {{is also the}} London terminus for the Venice Simplon Orient Express, from Platform 2, the longest platform. It was used for boat trains to Dover and Folkestone until these were made <b>redundant</b> {{by the introduction of}} Eurostar trains to the continent in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} of metagenomic data {{analysis}} requires the execution of certain pre-filtering steps, including the removal of <b>redundant,</b> low-quality sequences and sequences of probable eukaryotic origin (especially in metagenomes of human origin). The methods available {{for the removal of}} contaminating eukaryotic genomic DNA sequences include Eu-Detect and DeConseq.|$|E
