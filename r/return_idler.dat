50|$|Landing {{platforms}} {{are the two}} platforms(at the two ends) {{that house}} the curved sections of the tracks, {{as well as the}} gears and motors that drive the stairs. The top platform usually contains the motor assembly and the main drive gear, while the bottom holds the step <b>return</b> <b>idler</b> sprockets. These sections also anchor the ends of the escalator truss. Each platform also has a floor and a comb plate. The floor plate provides a place for the passengers to stand before they step onto the moving stairs, flush {{with the rest of the}} floor and usually hinged to allow easy maintenance access, while the comb plate lies between the stationary floor plate and the moving step, so named for the cleats on its edge which mesh with the matching cleats on each step (and resemble a comb). The interlocking cleats help to minimize the gap between the stairs and landing, preventing objects or persons from becoming caught in it.|$|E

40|$|Classical target {{detection}} {{can suffer}} large error probabilities in noisy and lossy environments when noise photons are mistaken for signal photons reflected from an object. It {{has been shown}} theoretically that the correlation between entangled photons {{can be used to}} better discriminate between the signal photons reflected by an object and noise photons, thus reducing the probability of error [13, 15, 17, 7, 6]. This thesis presents the first experimental implementation of target detection enhanced by quantum illumination (QI). Nondegenerate, time entangled signal and idler beams are created through Type-O spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). The signal is attenuated and combined with large levels of noise. The signal is phase modulated to improve the observation by shifting it from DC to 16 kHz. The <b>return</b> signal and <b>idler</b> are recombined in an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) which captures the phase correlation between the two beams. It is found that only 10 % of the total signal and idler photons interact at the OPA due to the multi-mode nature of the SPDC emission which does not match the pump spatial mode and thus experience lower gains at the OPA. Considering only the power interacting at the OPA, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of QI agrees with the theoretical model. by Sara L. Mouradian. Thesis (M. Eng.)

Muck from the excavated face, which is usually fairly wet when placed on the conveyor, dries out as it travels on the conveyor through the airstream. Water sprays placed at intervals along the conveyor will minimize dust from the conveyor contaminating the airstream. Conveyor transfer and drop points should be enclosed and provided with water sprays. Scraper and spray wash will wash <b>return</b> belts and <b>idlers.</b> 7. 5. 11 Airways, Haulage Ways, Mine Cars and Dumping Stations a) Airways and rail haulage ways Cleaning the walls and floors of airways and rail haulage ways, by periodically washing down or vacuuming, will remove many potential dust sources. Concrete lined openings facilitate cleaning. Residual dust and dirt {{should not be allowed}} to accumulate in the airways and haulage ways as these represent potential dust sources. b) Mine cars Keeping the muck in the mine cars wet reduces the potential for creating dust. Overloading cars must be avoided as it can lead to spillage which then becomes another potential dust source. Washing mine cars regularly will keep them free of dirt and dust, and parking a loaded mine car for a long periods should be avoided as this allows the muck to dry out. If feasible, major route of mine cars should not be along primary intake airways. c) Dumping Stations Subsurface muck car dumping stations represent major potential dust sources. Enclosure and bypass airways can be installed to avoid high velocity air/dust contact. Water spray at dump activated during dumping will wet the muck and suppress dust. Local dust scrubbers located at the dumps will clean dusty air that escapes from the dump station enclosures. Choice of location and equipment for dump stations must prioritize dust control. 7. 5. 12 Leakage and Recirculation of Contaminated Air from Exhaust Ducts Leakage from exhaust ducts containing contaminated air and subsequent recirculation of the leakage contributes to dust problems.
