5|$|Many prokaryotic {{genes are}} {{organized}} into operons, with multiple protein-coding sequences that are transcribed as a unit. The genes in an operon are transcribed {{as a continuous}} messenger RNA, {{referred to as a}} polycistronic mRNA. The term cistron in this context is equivalent to gene. The transcription of an operon’s mRNA is often controlled by a <b>repressor</b> that can occur in an active or inactive state depending on the presence of certain specific metabolites. When active, the <b>repressor</b> binds to a DNA sequence {{at the beginning of the}} operon, called the operator region, and represses transcription of the operon; when the <b>repressor</b> is inactive transcription of the operon can occur (see e.g. Lac operon). The products of operon genes typically have related functions and are involved in the same regulatory network.|$|E
5|$|Other {{studies in}} mice {{have found that}} TBR1 is a <b>repressor</b> or Fezf2. It has also been found to {{negatively}} regulate corticospinal tract formation.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream {{of the open}} reading frame that alter expression. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind <b>repressor</b> proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.|$|E

40|$|Transcriptional <b>repressors</b> can be {{characterized}} by their range of action on promoters and enhancers. Short-range <b>repressors</b> interact over distances of 50 - 150 bp to inhibit, or quench, either upstream activators or the basal transcription complex. In contrast, long-range <b>repressors</b> act over several kilobases to silence basal promoters. We describe recent progress in characterizing the functional properties of one such long-range element in the Drosophila embryo and discuss the contrasting types of gene regulation that are made possible by short- and long-range <b>repressors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated that <b>repressors</b> forget more negative memories which may be due to enhanced inhibitory abilities. To investigate this issue the retrieval practice paradigm was modified for use with neutral and negative personality traits. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants chose neutral and negative traits which were self descriptive and then performed retrieval practice on the neutral traits. <b>Repressors</b> and low anxious participants were found to demonstrate forgetting of negative traits with <b>repressors</b> forgetting more negative traits than low anxious participants. In Experiment 2 the inhibitory account was tested by comparing retrieval practice with re-presentation. Retrieval practice led to forgetting but re-presentation did not. In Experiment 3 forgetting of neutral traits was evident in the <b>repressors</b> and low anxious groups but <b>repressors</b> did not exhibit increased forgetting. In Experiment 4 the cue independent method was used to examine inhibition for neutral material. All groups demonstrated forgetting but <b>repressors</b> did not demonstrate enhanced inhibition. These findings indicate that <b>repressors</b> demonstrate enhanced forgetting only for self referential negative information...|$|R
5|$|Fezf2 is a {{gene that}} is {{regulated}} by TBR1. Fezf2 expression is observed in layer V of the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is constructed in six layers. Fezf2 expression is restricted to layer V for proper development and migration of neurons of the corticospinal tract, which is derived from layer V neurons and is involved in voluntary muscular control. Recent studies show that TBR1, expressed in layer VI, binds directly to the Fezf2 gene, preventing Fezf2 expression in layer VI. In this manner, TBR1 acts as a transcription <b>repressor</b> of Fezf2. Mutation of TBR1 results in Fezf2 expression in layer VI and malformation of the corticospinal tract. Abnormal activation of TBR1 in layer V eliminates corticospinal tract formation.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{suggest that}} the Af9 protein acts as a <b>repressor</b> of Tbr1 in the upper layers of the six-layer {{developing}} cerebral cortex, thereby confining Tbr1 to the lower cortical layers (preplate, subplate, layer VI). This process is regulated through interaction of Af9 with the methyltransferase DOT1L, which methylates histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79). Af9 association with DOT1L enhances methylation of H3K79 at the TBR1 transcription start site, thereby interfering with RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) activity and reducing TBR1 expression. Mutants of Af9 experience increased dimethylation of H3K79 and increased TBR1 expression.|$|E
5|$|The SOS {{response}} is {{the changes in}} gene expression in Escherichia coli and other bacteria in response to extensive DNA damage. The prokaryotic SOS system is regulated by two key proteins: LexA and RecA. The LexA homodimer is a transcriptional <b>repressor</b> that binds to operator sequences {{commonly referred to as}} SOS boxes. In Escherichia coli it is known that LexA regulates transcription of approximately 48 genes including the lexA and recA genes. The SOS {{response is}} known to be widespread in the Bacteria domain, but it is mostly absent in some bacterial phyla, like the Spirochetes.|$|E
40|$|Two {{putative}} {{functions of}} emotion experience — its roles in intentional action and in social understanding — were investigated using {{a group of}} individuals (<b>repressors)</b> known to have impaired anxiety experience. <b>Repressors,</b> low-anxious, high-anxious, and defensive high-anxious individuals were asked to give a public presentation, and then {{given the opportunity to}} avoid the presentation. <b>Repressors</b> were the group most likely to avoid giving the presentation, but were the least likely to give an emotional explanation for their avoidance. By contrast, they were not less likely than other groups to provide negative emotional explanations of another person’s behaviour in a film clip. We concluded that: (1) <b>repressors</b> are impaired in self- but not in other-explanation using emotion, implying that “simulation” is not the method used by <b>repressors</b> to ground their folk psychology, (2) the intentional avoidance shown by <b>repressors</b> is indicative of some intact first-order phenomenal anxiety experience but that they lack second-order awareness of this anxiety experience...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on repressive coping style and self-reports of the anger. In the {{theoretical}} part are elaborated chapters concerning the definition of emotion, emotion regulation, coping and repressive coping style. The <b>Repressors</b> are characterized by unconscious denial of their own anxiety and self-image distortion within the low susceptibility to negative emotions. The research study focuses on the expression of anger by <b>repressors</b> and their comparison with other groups. Respondents (n= 122) were divided into four groups using conventional questionnaires (STAI, MCSD) : <b>repressors</b> (n= 26), high-anxious (n= 16), defensive high-anxious (n= 47) and low-anxious (n= 33). The aim {{of the study was}} find out differences in the expression of anger and trait anger. The hypotheses were partly supported, as the results in the expression of anger and trait anger pointed to differences between <b>repressors</b> and low-anxious and partly supported among other groups. The present study shows that <b>repressors</b> distort even other socially censored emotions, in this case anger...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} defense mechanisms, <b>repressors</b> (n= 14), highly anxious (n = 37) and low anxious (n = 7) {{groups were}} tested with the Meta Contrast Technique (Smith, Johnson, Almgren & Johanson, 2001). The division into <b>repressors</b> and anxiety groups {{was made on}} a larger group (N = 140), which was also investigated with respect to experienced access to preconscious processes, here operationalized as memory for dreams. Results: The <b>repressors</b> got higher scores on immature defense mechanisms than the highly or low anxious groups (p =. 04 versus p <. 05). The <b>repressors</b> {{as well as the}} highly anxious group were higher on a measure of overall defense than the low anxious group (p <. 05 in both comparisons). Regarding the separate defense categories, a significant difference was found for repression, which was more frequent in the highly anxious than in the low anxious group (p =. 003). Memory for dreams differed only in the men. The male <b>repressors</b> scored significantly lower on dream memory than the highly anxious men (p <. 02). The immature defensive structure in the <b>repressors</b> was discussed in terms of regressive reactions, speculatively {{due to a lack of}} symbolic functioning concerning anxiety-arousing areas, i. e. alexithymia...|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} {{cellular}} signals activating the SOS response are regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), arising from stalled replication forks or double-strand breaks, which are processed by DNA helicase {{to separate the}} two DNA strands. In the initiation step, RecA protein binds to ssDNA in an ATP hydrolysis driven reaction creating RecA–ssDNA filaments. RecA–ssDNA filaments activate LexA autoprotease activity, which ultimately leads to cleavage of LexA dimer and subsequent LexA degradation. The loss of LexA <b>repressor</b> induces transcription of the SOS genes and allows for further signal induction, inhibition of cell division {{and an increase in}} levels of proteins responsible for damage processing.|$|E
5|$|Three prime untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of {{messenger}} RNAs (mRNAs) often contain regulatory sequences that post-transcriptionally cause RNA interference. Such 3'-UTRs often contain both binding {{sites for}} microRNAs (miRNAs) {{as well as}} for regulatory proteins. By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript. The 3'-UTR also may have silencer regions that bind <b>repressor</b> proteins that inhibit the expression of a mRNA.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate {{them from the}} rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy. Hexokinase is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming glucose-6-phosphate from glucose. At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional <b>repressor</b> complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.|$|E
40|$|Individuals with a repressive {{coping style}} self-report low anxiety, but show high defensiveness and high {{physiological}} arousal. <b>Repressors</b> have impoverished negative autobiographical memories and {{are better able}} to suppress memory for negatively valenced and self-related laboratory materials when asked to do so. Research on spontaneous forgetting of negative information in <b>repressors</b> suggests that they show significant forgetting of negative items, but only after a delay. Unknown is whether increased forgetting after a delay is potentiated by self-relevance. Here we asked in three experiments whether <b>repressors</b> would show reduced episodic memories for negative self-relevant information when tested immediately versus after a 2 -day delay. We predicted that <b>repressors</b> would show an exaggerated reduction in recall of negative self-relevant memories after a delay, at least without anew priming of this information. We tested a total of 300 participants (experiment 1 : N= 95, experiment 2 : N= 106; experiment 3 : N= 99) of four types: <b>repressors,</b> high anxious, low anxious, and defensive high anxious individuals. Participants judged positive and negative adjectives with regard to self-descriptiveness, serving as incidental encoding. Surprise free recall was conducted immediately after encoding (experiment 1), after a 2 -day delay (experiment 2) or after a 2 -day delay following priming via a lexical decision task (experiment 3). In experiment 1, <b>repressors</b> showed a bias against negative self-relevant words in immediate recall. Such a bias was neither observed in delayed recall without priming nor in delayed recall with priming. Thus, counter to our hypothesis, negative information that was initially judged as self-relevant was not forgotten at a higher rate after a delay in <b>repressors.</b> We suggest that <b>repressors</b> may reinterpret initially negative information in a more positive light after a delay, and therefore no longer experience the need to bias their recall after a delay...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{pervasive}} roles for <b>repressors</b> in transcriptional control, {{the range of}} action of these proteins on cis regulatory elements remains poorly understood. Knirps has essential roles in patterning the Drosophila embryo by means of short-range repression, an activity that is essential for proper regulation of complex transcriptional control elements. Short-range <b>repressors</b> function in a local fashion {{to interfere with the}} activity of activators or basal promoters within ≈ 100 bp. In contrast, long-range <b>repressors</b> such as Hairy act over distances > 1 kb. The functional distinction between these two classes of <b>repressors</b> has been suggested to stem from the differential recruitment of the CtBP corepressor to short-range <b>repressors</b> and Groucho to long-range <b>repressors.</b> Contrary to this differential recruitment model, we report that Groucho is a functional part of the Knirps short-range repression complex. The corepressor interaction is mediated via an eh- 1 like motif present in the N terminus and a conserved region present in the central portion of Knirps. We also show that this interaction is important for the CtBP-independent repression activity of Knirps and is required for regulation of even-skipped. Our study uncovers a previously uncharacterized interaction between proteins previously thought to function in distinct repression pathways, and indicates that the Groucho corepressor can be differentially harnessed to execute short- and long-range repression...|$|R
5|$|Transcription {{produces}} a single-stranded RNA molecule known as messenger RNA, whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the DNA {{from which it}} was transcribed. The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product. The gene's DNA {{is used as a}} template to generate a complementary mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5'direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region, either by tight binding by <b>repressor</b> molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.|$|E
25|$|In {{negative}} repressible operons, transcription of the operon normally takes place. <b>Repressor</b> proteins {{are produced}} by a regulator gene, but {{they are unable to}} bind to the operator in their normal conformation. However, certain molecules called corepressors are bound by the <b>repressor</b> protein, causing a conformational change to the active site. The activated <b>repressor</b> protein binds to the operator and prevents transcription. The trp operon, involved in the synthesis of tryptophan (which itself acts as the corepressor), is a negatively controlled repressible operon.|$|E
25|$|Cooperative binding of {{proteins}} onto nucleic acids {{has also been}} shown. A classical example is the binding of the lambda phage <b>repressor</b> to its operators, which occurs cooperatively. Other examples of transcription factors exhibit positive cooperativity when binding their target, such as the <b>repressor</b> of the TtgABC pumps (n=1.6).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a frequency analysis of causal conjunctions and explainers in the speech of persons categorised as low-anxious, high-anxious, and <b>repressors,</b> selected according to the criteria of Weinberger et al. (1979). Ninety female students, assigned to three groups: high-anxious persons (n = 30), low-anxious persons (n = 30), and anxiety <b>repressors</b> (n = 30), gave a speech lasting several minutes concerning personality features that they liked or disliked in themselves. The results strongly confirmed the hypothesis that there are differences in the frequency of use of causal conjunctions and explainers between <b>repressors,</b> high-anxious, and low-anxious individuals. Their number is highest in the utterances of <b>repressors</b> and lowest in the utterances of low-anxious individuals. Our study demonstrates that the experiencing of anxiety does not in itself lead to an increase in the frequency of use of causal expressions. The key factor would appear to be a high level of defensiveness and absence of insight into one’s emotional states, characteristic of <b>repressors.</b> This may lead to a need to rationalise and to seek possible causes for the state of anxiety, which is externalised linguistically {{through the use of a}} high number of causal expressions...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{spatially}} localized <b>repressors</b> {{in supporting}} embryonic patterning is well appreciated, but, alternatively, the role ubiquitously expressed <b>repressors</b> {{play in this}} process is not well understood.

Our data show that broadly expressed <b>repressors</b> silence particular enhancers within cis-regulatory systems, blocking their expression throughout the embryo fully but transiently, and, in this manner, regulate spatiotemporal outputs along both axes.

40|$|The pre-cellular Drosophila embryo {{contains}} 10 well characterized sequence-specific transcriptional <b>repressors,</b> {{which represent}} {{a broad spectrum}} of DNA-binding proteins. Previous studies have shown that two of the <b>repressors,</b> Hairy and Dorsal, recruit a common co-repressor protein, Groucho.

In contrast, the Dorsal and Hairy <b>repressors</b> retain at least some activity in dCtBP mutant embryos. dCtBP interacts with Krüppel, Knirps and Snail through a related sequence motif, PXDLSXK/H.

40|$|Low {{accessibility}} of threatening information {{is a crucial}} element {{in the theory of}} repression. Despite many attempts, no empirical evidence has been found for such an inverse memory bias in normal subjects. An alternative approach is to study repressive processes as an individual dierence. Adopting such a trait approach, several studies have shown impaired memory for threatening memories of real-life episodes in so-called <b>repressors.</b> Several other studies have yielded evidence of avoidant processing of mildly threatening information {{in the early stages of}} information processing in <b>repressors.</b> Thus far, little evidence for a similar avoidant bias in memory has been oered for <b>repressors.</b> To demonstrate the presence of memory deficits for mildly threatening information, we tested recall and cued recognition after a 30 min delay, for (i) threatening, (ii) pleasant, and (iii) neutral words in <b>repressors</b> and non-repressors. No proof was found for poorer recall and recognition of threatening words in <b>repressors,</b> or for lower numbers of threatening semantic intrusions in these individuals, while the power of the study was adequate. While repression-related avoidant processing may be present for even mildly threatening stimuli at earlier stages of information processing, the results of the present study indicate that repressed memory may only show up for relatively intense emotional events.

40|$|Background: Coping {{plays an}} {{important}} role for emotion regulation in threatening situations. The model of coping modes designates repression and sensitization as two independent coping styles. Repression consists of strategies that shield the individual from arousal. Sensitization indicates increased analysis of the environment in order to reduce uncertainty. According to the discontinuity hypothesis, <b>repressors</b> are sensitive to threat {{in the early stages of}} information processing. While <b>repressors</b> do not exhibit memory disturbances early on, they manifest weak memory for these stimuli later. This study investigates the discontinuity hypothesis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: Healthy volunteers (20 <b>repressors</b> and 20 sensitizers) were selected from a sample of 150 students on the basis of the Mainz Coping Inventory. During the fMRI experiment, subjects evaluated and memorized emotional and neutral faces. Subjects performed two sessions of face recognition: immediately after the fMRI session and three days later. Results: <b>Repressors</b> exhibited greater activation of frontal, parietal and temporal areas during encoding of angry faces compared to sensitizers. There were no differences in recognition of facial emotions between groups neither immediately after exposure nor after three days. Conclusions: The fMRI findings suggest that <b>repressors</b> manifest an enhanced neural processing of directly threatening facial expression which confirms the assumption of hyper-responsivity to threatening information in repression in an early processing stage. A discrepancy was observed between high neural activation in encoding-relevant brain areas in response to angry faces in <b>repressors</b> and no advantage in subsequent memory for these faces compared to sensitizers...|$|R
