40|$|We {{report on}} the use of a frequency-modulated {{continuous}} wave (FMCW) technique for multiplexing fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. This technique is based on the modulation of light intensity from a broadband source by a linear swept- frequency RF carrier. Signals from the FBG sensors located at different positions in an array are separated in frequency-domain and demodulated using a tunable optical filter. The potential and limitation of the technique are discussed. A 3 -sensor FMCW multiplexed FBG array of parallel topology and a 6 -sensor hybrid FMCW/WDM system were experimentally demonstrated with - 30 dB crosstalk between sensors and 2 (mu) (epsilon) resolution in terms of <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>strain</b> value.

A sample of Cu with sub-micrometer grain size produced by severe plastic deformation was also examined.

40|$|International audienceSolid-state phase {{transitions}} in SiC are investigated using diffuse x-ray scattering andMonte Carlo simulations. As an example, the 3 C- 6 H transformation is investigated in detail. The transformation is modeled with a statistical algorithm {{based on the}} concept of double cross-slipping and subsequent dissociation of basal plane dislocations. The corresponding diffuse x-ray scattering curves are calculated and quantitatively compared with experimental data obtained from 3 C-SiC crystals annealed at high temperatures (1700 - 2100 ◦ C). From the simulations, it is demonstrated that the transformation implies the multiplication and ordering of double and triple stacking faults (SFs). The transformation level and <b>root-mean-squared</b> <b>strains</b> associated with the dislocations are determined from the simulations. The defect structure formed during the transition can be rationalized by considering the relative energies of the SFs. Using an axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising interaction model we show that single SFs are not energetically favored, whereas the simultaneous occurrence of double and triple SFs implies that their relative energy difference remains below a critical value (∼ 8 - 9 %) ...|$|R

40|$|Deformation in nanocrystalline (NC) {{materials}} is {{strongly influenced by}} the presence of a large fraction of grain boundaries. We present a comparative study on the role of intragranular <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>strain</b> and crystal-lographic texture on recovery processes. The detailed microstructure analysis with conventional X ray diffraction and in-situ synchrotron measurements during deformation are used to understand the various attributes of recovery mechanisms associated with annealing and deformation of electrodeposited NC nickel (grain size = 30 nm). Our results emphasize the dominance of local atomic rearrangements during thermal recovery processes, while deformation induced recovery processes are supported primarily by large-scale dislocation activity. The in-situ deformation of NC samples with two different textures illustrates further the influence of gran boundary character on recovery processes...|$|E
40|$|Free {{vibrations}} of two side-by-side cylinders with {{fixed support}} (no rotation and displacement) {{at both ends}} placed in a cross-flow were experimentally investigated. Two fibre-optic Bragg grating sensors were {{used to measure the}} dynamic strain, while a hot wire and flow visualization were employed to examine the flow field around the cylinders. Three T/d ratios, 3. 00, 1. 70 and 1. 13, were investigated, where T is the centre-to-centre cylinder spacing and d is the diameter; they give rise to three different flow regimes. The investigation throws new light on the shed vortices and their evolution. A new interpretation is proposed for the two different dominant frequencies, which are associated with the narrow and the wide wake when the gap between the cylinders is between 1. 5 and 2. 0 as reported in the literature. The structural vibration behaviour is closely linked to the flow characteristics. At T/d = 3 : 00, the cross-flow <b>root-mean-square</b> <b>strain</b> distribution shows a very prominent peak at the reduced velocity Ur [approximate] 26 when the vortex shedding frequency fs, coincides with the third-mode natural frequency of the combined fluid–cylinder system. When T/d < 3 : 00, this peak is not evident and the vibration is suppressed because of the weakening strength of the vortices. The characteristics of the system modal damping ratios, including both structural and fluid damping, and natural frequencies are also investigated. It is found that both parameters depend on T/d. Furthermore, they vary slowly with Ur, except near resonance where a sharp variation occurs. The sharp variation in the natural frequencies of the combined system is dictated by the vortex shedding frequency, in contrast with the lock-in phenomenon, where the forced vibration of a structure modifies the vortex shedding frequency. This behaviour of the system natural frequencies persists even {{in the case of the}} single cylinder and does not seem to depend on the interference between cylinders. A linear analysis of an isolated cylinder in a cross-flow has been carried out. The linear model prediction is qualitatively consistent with the experimental observation of the system damping ratios and natural frequencies, thus providing valuable insight into the physics of fluid–structure interactions.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{synthetic}} pyrope-grossular garnets (Mg 3 Al 2 Si 3 O 12 -Ca 3 Al 2 Si 3 O 12) were investigated by powder X-ray synchrotron radiation at 5 K {{to determine their}} microscopic structural strain, which {{may be responsible for}} the observed excess enthalpy of mixing for this binary. This substitutional solid solution provides an excellent system for investigating microscopic-macroscopic relationships and the physical nature behind non-ideal thermodynamic mixing behavior in silicates, because of the measurable nonidealities shown by its enthalpy and volume of mixing. An analysis of the X-ray refection profiles, based on theoretical considerations of X-ray line broadening, permits {{for the first time a}} direct experimental determination of crystallite size and the <b>root-mean-square</b> structural <b>strain</b> for a mineral solid solution. The measured microscopic strain shows positive and asymmetric deviations from linearity across the join with the largest excess in pyrope-rich compositions.

40|$|Abridged.) The mean-square current {{quadrupole}} moment {{associated with}} vorticity fluctuations in high-Reynolds-number turbulence in a differentially rotating neutron star is calculated analytically, {{as are the}} amplitude and decoherence time of the resulting, stochastic gravitational wave signal. The calculation resolves the subtle {{question of whether the}} signal is dominated by the smallest or largest turbulent eddies: for the Kolmogorov-like power spectrum observed in superfluid spherical Couette simulations, the wave strain is controlled by the largest eddies, and the decoherence time approximately equals the maximum eddy turnover time. For a neutron star with spin frequency ν_s and Rossby number Ro, at a distance d from Earth, the <b>root-mean-square</b> wave <b>strain</b> reaches h_RMS≈ 3 × 10 ^- 24 Ro^ 3 (ν_s / 30 Hz) ^ 3 (d/ 1 kpc) ^- 1. A cross-correlation search can detect such a source in principle, because the signal decoheres over the time-scale τ_c ≈ 10 ^- 3 Ro^- 1 (ν_s / 30 Hz) ^- 1 s, which is adequately sampled by existing long-baseline interferometers. Hence hydrodynamic turbulence imposes a fundamental noise floor on gravitational wave observations of neutron stars, although its polluting effect may be muted by partial decoherence in the hectohertz band, where current continuous-wave searches are concentrated, for the highest frequency (and hence most powerful) sources.

40|$|The gravitational-wave (GW) sky {{may include}} nearby {{pointlike}} sources {{as well as}} astrophysical and cosmological stochastic backgrounds. Since the relative strength and angular distribution of the many possible sources of GWs are not well constrained, searches for GW signals must be performed in a model-independent way. To that end we perform two directional searches for persistent GWs {{using data from the}} LIGO S 5 science run: one optimized for pointlike sources and one for arbitrary extended sources. The latter result is the first of its kind. Finding no evidence to support the detection of GWs, we present 90 % confidence level (CL) upper-limit maps of GW strain power with typical values between 2 - 20 X 10 (exp - 50) strain 2 Hz(exp - 1) and 5 - 35 X 10 (exp - 49) strain 2 Hz(exp - 1) /sr for pointlike and extended sources respectively. The limits on pointlike sources constitute a factor of 30 improvement over the previous best limits.
