5|$|Corrective <b>rape</b> <b>is</b> on {{the rise}} in South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped or gang-raped weekly, as {{estimated}} by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit. It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the Western Cape live in fear of being sexually assaulted, as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008. Yet, victims of corrective rape are less likely to report it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Pyramid Head has been favorable {{because of his}} distinctive appearance and role as an element of James' psyche. Critics cite him as an iconic villain of the Silent Hill series, a favorite among fans, {{and part of the}} appeal of Silent Hill 2. GameSpot compared Pyramid Head's appearance to Leatherface, the main antagonist of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series of slasher films, and found him the most terrifying monster in Silent Hill 2. Computerworld named Pyramid Head {{as one of the most}} terrifying villains in computer and video games. GamesRadar felt that the scene in which he rapes the two other monsters was unsettling, since the subject of <b>rape</b> <b>is</b> not often tackled in video games, and disliked the final battle with him because of how anti-climactic it was, in comparison with his role throughout the rest of the game.|$|E

5000|$|In Soviet Russia <b>rapes</b> <b>were</b> only {{a concern}} if they {{undermined}} military discipline. Since 1941, <b>rape</b> <b>was</b> theoretically punishable {{with the death}} sentence, although, <b>rapes</b> <b>were</b> rarely prosecuted in practice and rapes by Germans of non-German women were not taken seriously, nor was it punishable by death, especially in the eastern European territories. In October 1940 the laws on <b>rape</b> <b>were</b> changed, making it a [...] "petitioned crime" [...] - that is a crime for which punishment had to be requested. Historian Christa Paul writes that this resulted in [...] "a nearly complete absence of prosecution and punishment for rape". There <b>were</b> <b>rape</b> cases in the east where the perpetrators were sentenced if the <b>rape</b> <b>was</b> highly visible, damaging {{to the image of}} the German Army and the courts were willing to pass a condemning verdict against the accused.|$|R

25|$|<b>Rape</b> <b>is</b> a type {{of sexual}} assault usually {{involving}} sexual intercourse {{or other forms of}} sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person's consent. The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority, or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent.

25|$|Rape, {{sometimes}} called sexual assault, is an assault {{by a person}} involving sexual intercourse with or sexual penetration of another person without that person's consent. <b>Rape</b> <b>is</b> generally considered a serious sex crime {{as well as a}} civil assault.

25|$|Rape, {{including}} spousal <b>rape,</b> <b>is</b> {{a criminal}} offense. Penalties for rape range {{from five to}} 15 years' imprisonment, and the government generally enforces the law. In 2004 the Criminal Code was changed so that the age for statutory <b>rape</b> <b>is</b> 14; previously, the age was 12. The law protects the privacy and safety of the person making the charge. In 2006 from January to November, police received reports of 1,926 cases of rape, compared with 2,451 cases in all of 2005; experts believed that most rape cases go unreported. The Ministry of Justice and the PICH have several offices specifically to provide counseling and assistance in rape cases.

50|$|Although Japanese {{reports of}} <b>rape</b> <b>were</b> largely ignored at the time, {{academic}} estimates {{have been that}} as many as 10,000 Okinawan women may have <b>been</b> <b>raped.</b> It has <b>been</b> claimed that the <b>rape</b> <b>was</b> so prevalent that most Okinawans over age 65 around the year 2000 either knew or had heard of a woman who <b>was</b> <b>raped</b> {{in the aftermath of the}} war.

5000|$|As <b>rape</b> <b>was</b> more {{commonly}} studied, research in different fields hypothesized why <b>rape</b> <b>was</b> such a common phenomenon.

From a biological desire, neo-Darwinists theorized <b>rape</b> <b>was</b> used as a mechanism to spread genes quickly and efficiently.

25|$|North Carolina {{had also}} enacted a {{mandatory}} {{death penalty for}} first-degree rape, but the Court later ruled in Coker v.

25|$|Pregnancy from <b>rape</b> <b>is</b> {{an ethical}} and moral {{issue in the}} context of {{opposition}} to legal abortion.

5000|$|In Canada, marital <b>rape</b> <b>was</b> made {{illegal in}} 1983, when several legal changes were made, {{including}} changing the rape statute to sexual assault, {{and making the}} laws gender neutral.

The views of Sir Matthew Hale, a 17th-century jurist, published in The History of the Pleas of the Crown (1736), stated that a husband cannot be guilty of the rape of his wife because the wife [...] "hath given up herself in this kind to her husband, which she cannot retract"; in England and Wales this would remain law for more than 250 years, until it was abolished by the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords, {{in the case of}} R v R in 1991.
