40|$|AbstractProgressing {{limits on}} {{pollutant}} emissions oblige ship owners {{to reduce the}} environmental impact of their operations. Fuel cells may provide a suitable solution, since they are fuel efficient while they emit few hazardous compounds. Various choices can be made with regard to the type of fuel cell system and logistic fuel, and it is unclear which have the best prospects for maritime application. An overview of fuel cell types and fuel processing equipment is presented, and maritime fuel cell application is reviewed with regard to efficiency, gravimetric and volumetric density, dynamic behaviour, environmental impact, safety and economics. It is shown that low temperature fuel cells using liquefied hydrogen provide a compact solution for ships with a <b>refuelling</b> <b>interval</b> up to a tens of hours, but may result in total system sizes up to five times larger than high temperature fuel cells and more energy dense fuels for vessels with longer mission requirements. The expanding infrastructure of liquefied natural gas and development state of natural gas-fuelled fuel cell systems can facilitate the introduction of gaseous fuels and fuel cells on ships. Fuel cell combined cycles, hybridisation with auxiliary electricity storage systems and redundancy improvements are identified as topics for further study...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to present the current status of {{development}} of the Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) in Generation IV (GEN IV), including the European contribution, to identify needed R&D and to present the corresponding GEN IV International Forum (GIF) R&D plan [1] to support the future development and deployment of lead-cooled fast reactors. The approach of the GIF plan is to consider the research priorities of each member country in proposing an integrated, coordinated R&D program to achieve common objectives, while avoiding duplication of effort. The integrated plan recognizes two principal technology tracks: (1) a small, transportable system of 10 - 100 MWe size that features a very long <b>refuelling</b> <b>interval,</b> and (2) a larger-sized system rated at about 600 MWe, intended for central station power generation. This paper provides some details of the important European contributions to the development of the LFR. Sixteen European organizations have, in fact, taken the initiative to present to the European Commission the proposal for a Specific Targeted Research and Training Project (STREP) devoted to the development of a European Lead-cooled System, known as the ELSY project; two additional organizations from the US and Korea have joined the project. Consequently, ELSY will constitute the reference system for the large lead-cooled reactor of GEN IV. The ELSY project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of designing a competitive and safe fast power reactor based on simple technical engineered features that achieves all of the GEN IV goals and gives assurance of investment protection. As far as new technology development is concerned, only a limited amount of R&D will be conducted in the initial phase of the ELSY project since the first priority is to define the design guidelines before launching a larger and expensive specific R&D program. In addition, the ELSY project is expected to benefit greatly from ongoing lead and lead-alloy technology development already being carried out in different institutes participating in this STREP. This is particularly true in Europe where a large R&D program associated with the development of Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) is being actively pursued. The general objective of the ELSY project is to design an innovative lead-cooled fast reactor complemented by an analytical effort to assess the existing knowledge base in the field of lead-alloy coolants (i. e., lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) and also lead/lithium) in order to extrapolate this knowledge base to pure lead. This analysis effort will be complemented with some limited R&D activities to acquire missing or confirmatory information about fundamental topics for ELSY that are not sufficiently covered in the ongoing European ADS program or elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{propulsion}} {{has many}} potential advantages {{in terms of}} reduced emissions, as nuclear fission itself has zero CO 2, NOx, SOx and PM emissions, although the whole nuclear fuel cycle has an amount of emission associated with it. An overview of current and future reactor technologies suitable for marine propulsion is presented. A comparison in terms of efficiency and technology used is performed and technical and constructional aspects for surface non - military applications are discussed. A debate of feasible ship types is made and proposals of propulsion layouts are highlighted {{including the use of}} all electric ship concepts. The actual engine loading and the efficiency of propulsion components have great importance in propulsion behaviour and fuel consumption, which imply further constraints in merchant nuclear propulsion applications in terms of <b>refuelling</b> <b>intervals.</b> The social impacts and constraints in operation of such vessels, orients the designers towards large DWT vessels that can load and unload outside the ports...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{circulator}} (GC) {{units are}} an important rotating asset used in the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) design, facilitating the flow of CO 2 gas through the reactor core. The ongoing maintenance and examination of these machines is important for operators {{in order to maintain}} safe and economic generation. GCs experience a dynamic duty cycle with periods of non-steady state behavior at regular <b>refuelling</b> <b>intervals,</b> posing a unique analysis problem for reliability engineers. In line with the increased data volumes and sophistication of available the technologies, the investigation of predictive and prognostic measurements has become a central interest in rotating asset condition monitoring. However, many of the state-of-the-art approaches finding success deal with the extrapolation of stationary time series feeds, with little to no consideration of more-complex but expected events in the data. In this paper we demonstrate a novel modelling approach for examining refuelling behaviors in GCs, with a focus on estimating their health state from vibration data. A machine learning model was constructed using the operational history of a unit experiencing an eventual inspection-based failure. This new approach to examining GC condition is shown to correspond well with explicit remaining useful life (RUL) measurements of the case study, improving on the existing rudimentary extrapolation methods often employed in rotating machinery health monitoring...|$|R
