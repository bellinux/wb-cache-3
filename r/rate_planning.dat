25|$|In a closed-circuit rebreather {{the oxygen}} partial {{pressure}} in the rebreather is controlled, {{so it can be}} maintained at a safe continuous maximum, which reduces the inert gas (nitrogen and/or helium) partial {{pressure in the}} breathing loop. Minimising the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues for a given dive profile reduces the decompression obligation. This requires continuous monitoring of actual partial pressures with time and for maximum effectiveness requires real-time computer processing by the diver's decompression computer. Decompression can be much reduced compared to fixed ratio gas mixes used in other scuba systems and, as a result, divers can stay down longer or require less time to decompress. A semi-closed circuit rebreather injects a constant mass flow of a fixed breathing gas mixture into the breathing loop, or replaces a specific percentage of the respired volume, so the partial pressure of oxygen {{at any time during the}} dive depends on the diver's oxygen consumption and/or breathing <b>rate.</b> <b>Planning</b> decompression requirements requires a more conservative approach for a SCR than for a CCR, but decompression computers with a real time oxygen partial pressure input can optimise decompression for these systems.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In a {{personal}} communication service (PCS) network, the call completion probability and the effective call holding times for both complete and incomplete calls are central parameters {{in the network}} cost/performance evaluation. These quantities {{will depend on the}} distributions of call holding times and cell residence times. The classical assumptions made in the past that call holding times and cell residence times are exponentially distributed are not appropriate for the emerging PCS networks. This paper presents some systematic results on the probability of call completion and the effective call holding time distributions for complete and incomplete calls with general cell residence times and call holding times distributed with various distributions such as Gamma, Erlang, hyperexponential, hyper-Erlang, and other staged distributions. These results provide a set of alternatives for PCS network modeling, which can be chosen to accommodate the measured data from PCS field trials. The application of these results in billing <b>rate</b> <b>planning</b> is also discussed.

40|$|Prior {{research}} suggests that wireless subscribers often overpay for their services due to subscription of <b>rate</b> <b>plans</b> that are not financially optimized. Some wireless carriers have responded by introducing {{a new type of}} plan called "Flex", which gives subscribers the best service rate based on their actual usage. In Canada, this kind of cost-minimizing plan is only available for 3 G data service. Should it be extended to customers who are using the "bread-and-butter" voice service? To what extent do they select inappropriate <b>rate</b> <b>plans?</b> This paper explores these issues by analysing subscribers' <b>rate</b> <b>plan</b> suitability with a focus on their revenue implications. Based on a 44 -month study of 8146 postpaid wireless subscribers, this paper reveals that optimal <b>rate</b> <b>plan</b> subscribers contribute approximately 50 % less revenue than those with non-optimal plans.

40|$|Our current alarm about traffic {{congestion}} stems {{in large part}} from perception of trends: thirty years ago traffic flowed smoothly; today it crawls. If this trend continues, congestion will become gridlock. These perceptions lead to statements such as: "There is no point to building highways, new lanes fill up {{as soon as they}} are opened. " I present evidence to show that such trend-based thinking is wrong because it ignores structural shifts in the demographics of auto ownership and use. At this time, auto ownership is effectively saturated: we are very close to the point where all the potential drivers have auto access. The ratio of autos per driver can continue to grow, but since it is only possible to drive one vehicle at a time, the growth rate of auto-use must decline to about the rate of population growth [...] a rate which is 2. 9 times lower than the rate we have experienced in the period since 1960. Thus, fatalistic prophesies about future gridlock have overstated the potential growth of demand for auto travel. That growth has already declined and it should level off to a rate which is only one-third as large as we are used to. This is a manageable <b>rate,</b> <b>planning</b> is possible. And, specifically, it is appropriate to think about building new roads to solve our deficiency of highway capacity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{explored}} a theoretically-driven permutation of {{an intervention}} {{designed to improve}} ITAs ’ spoken Discourse Intonation (DI). The object was to learn if implicit knowledge growth in DI could be found {{as the result of}} an experimental group participating in explicit instruction and in audio-assisted repeated reading treatments using twice-weekly easy, popular science texts for 14 weeks. In a read-aloud condition where speech processing burdens were reduced, both an experimental and control group (who received explicit instruction only) improved over time on speech <b>rate,</b> <b>planning</b> pauses versus hesitation pauses, prominence, tone choices, and length of tone choice pause groups. In a free-response task where processing burdens were increased, however, there was little evidence of change in implicit knowledge of DI for the experimental group. One positive thing was learned: Explicit DI instruction did not reduce participants ’ speech rate and thus participants could focus on form as well as meaning in extended speech. Explicit DI instruction, where form is linked to meaning, is worthwhile in that explicit knowledge may become proceduralized and available for learners ’ extemporaneous use. Implicit knowledge building in DI, while difficult to demonstrate, may still be worthwhile if it builds learners ’ knowledge of vocabulary (to improve prominence) and builds their experience hearing DI features linked to meaning within extended texts...|$|E

40|$|Throughout the United States it {{is common}} {{practice}} for automobile insurance premiums for a particular policy to vary depending upon the driver class and geographic location of the policyholder {{as well as the}} type and number of vehicles covered by the policy. In addition, most states also permit so-called "merit rating" plans whereby each policyholder's annual premium is adjusted up or down depending upon the insured's claims experience and traffice violation record during previous years. Although these merit <b>rating</b> <b>plans</b> may be viewed as a special type of risk classification, the rationale underlying their use {{is quite different from the}} justification for driver class and territory differentials. This paper develops a methodology for evaluating merit <b>rating</b> <b>plans</b> that are used in conjunction with other risk classification criteria. A theoretically equitable merit <b>rating</b> <b>plan</b> is designed and compared with plans commonly used throughout the country. The differences are striking, especially among high risk classes.

40|$|Electric {{utilities}} today {{must contain}} costs {{at a time}} when many need to modernize aging systems and all face major changes in technologies, customer preferences and competitive pressures. Most U. S. electric utility facilities are investor-owned, subject to rate and service regulation by state public utility commissions. Regulatory systems under which these utilities operate affect their performance and ability to meet these challenges. In this business environment, multiyear <b>rate</b> <b>plans</b> have some advantages over traditional rate regulation. The report focuses on key design issues and provides case studies of the multiyear <b>rate</b> <b>plan</b> approach, applicable to both vertically integrated and restructured states. Mark Newton Lowry and Matt Makos of Pacific Energy Group Research and Jeff Deason of Berkeley Lab authored the report; Lisa Schwartz, Berkeley Lab, was project manager and technical editor. The report is aimed primarily at state utility regulators and stakeholders in the state regulatory process. The multiyear rate approach also provides ideas on how to streamline oversight of public power utilities and rural electric cooperatives for their governing boards. Two key provisions of multiyear <b>rate</b> <b>plans</b> strengthen cost containment incentives and streamline regulation: 1. Reducing frequency of rate cases, typically to every four or five years 2. Using an attrition relief mechanism to escalate rates or revenue between rate cases to address cost pressures such as inflation and growth in number of customers, independently of the utility’s own cost Better utility performance can be achieved under well-designed multiyear <b>rate</b> <b>plans</b> while achieving lower regulatory costs. Benefits can be shared between utilities and their customers. But plans can be complex and involve significant changes in the regulatory system. Designing plans that stimulate utility performance without undue risk and share benefits fairly can be challenging. This report discusses the rationale for multiyear <b>rate</b> <b>plans</b> and their usefulness under modern business conditions. It then explains critical plan design issues and challenges and presents results from numerical research that considers the extra incentive power achieved under different plan provisions. Next, the report presents several case studies of utilities that have operated under formal multiyear <b>rate</b> <b>plans</b> or, for various reasons, have stayed out of rate cases for more than a decade. These studies consider the effect of multiyear <b>rate</b> <b>plans</b> and <b>rate</b> case frequency on utility cost, reliability and other performance dimensions...|$|R

40|$|There are {{considerable}} {{quality differences}} across private Medicare Advantage insurance plans, {{so it is}} important that beneficiaries make informed choices. During open enrollment for the 2013 coverage year, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services sent letters to beneficiaries enrolled in low-quality Medicare Advantage plans (i. e., <b>plans</b> <b>rated</b> less than 3 stars for at least 3 consecutive years by Medicare) explaining the stars and encouraging them to reexamine their choices. To understand the effectiveness of these low-cost, behavioral “nudge” letters, we used a beneficiary-level national retrospective cohort and performed multivariate regression analysis of plan selection during the 2013 open enrollment period among those enrolled in <b>plans</b> <b>rated</b> less than 3 stars. Our analysis controls for beneficiary demographic characteristics, health and health care spending risks, the availability of alternative higher <b>rated</b> <b>plan</b> options in their local market, and historical disenrollment <b>rates</b> from the <b>plans.</b> We compared the behaviors of those beneficiaries who received the nudge letters with those who enrolled in similar poorly <b>rated</b> <b>plans</b> but did not receive such letters. We found that beneficiaries who received the nudge letter were almost twice as likely (28. 0 % [95 % confidence interval = 27. 7 %, 28. 2 %] vs. 15. 3 % [95 % confidence interval = 15. 1 %, 15. 5 %]) to switch to a higher <b>rated</b> <b>plan</b> compared with those who did not receive the letter. White beneficiaries, healthier beneficiaries, and those residing in areas with more high-performing plan choices were more likely to switch plans in response to the nudge. Our findings highlight both the importance and efficacy of providing timely and actionable information to beneficiaries about quality in the insurance marketplace to facilitate informed and value-based coverage decisions...|$|R
30|$|For retailors, {{although}} {{monthly average}} electricity price forecasting {{can help them}} set the <b>rate</b> <b>plan,</b> the contribution of monthly average price to the retailors is very limited. The reason is as follows. Monthly average price is the load weighted price of system load profile. If the load profiles of the customers of the retailor {{are different from the}} system load profile, the average cost per KWh of the retailor may be different from the monthly average electricity price due to the significant price difference between peak and off-peak hours.
