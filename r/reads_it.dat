5|$|Whilst at a {{boot camp}} trip with Steph and Fernando, Steph {{believes}} Gilly has feelings for Sarah, and is unaware his feelings are for her. During the trip, after Steph, Fernando and Gilly leave, Sarah is {{killed in a}} tragic parachute jump. Gilly writes a poem for Steph, and in it, offends Fernando. When Steph <b>reads</b> <b>it</b> she is angry at Gilly, who tells her it is Rhys who has the feelings for her. Fernando punches Rhys as Gilly convinces Steph {{he had nothing to}} do with the poem. In order to make Steph jealous, Gilly kisses Cheryl who is trying to make Calvin jealous. Despite using him, Cheryl develops true feelings for Gilly. Frankie Osborne (Helen Pearson) works out that Gilly is in love with Steph. However, Gilly denies it, saying that he loves Cheryl. Cheryl catches Gilly looking at an engagement ring, which Fernando has bought for Steph. She assumes the ring is for her and tells everyone in The Dog in the Pond that she and Gilly are getting married. Gilly reluctantly goes along, not wanting to hurt her feelings. Cheryl notices the growing closeness between Gilly and Steph and confronts him. On discovering he is in love with Steph, she breaks off their engagement, at the same time Steph and Fernando break up. Gilly goes travelling with Zoe and Mike Barnes (Tony Hirst). Steph, after being told about Gilly's feelings for her, rushes after him to admit her love just as Gilly leaves. Gilly returns on 5 March with his girlfriend Jem. Steph is upset when he proposes to Jem. Steph admits her feelings to Gilly, but he decides to stay with Jem. Rhys tells Jem that Gilly still loves Steph causing them to split up. Gilly and Steph finally confess their true feelings to each other and begin a relationship.|$|E

25|$|During data phases, the C/BE# {{lines are}} {{interpreted}} as active-low byte enables.

For <b>reads,</b> <b>it</b> is always legal to ignore the byte enable signals and simply return all 32 bits; cacheable memory resources are required to always return 32 valid bits. The byte enables are mainly useful for I/O space accesses where reads have side effects.|$|E

Aslan also reprimands her for using another spell to see what her friends say about her. She encounters a story-spell that she feels is the best story ever that disappears after she <b>reads</b> <b>it,</b> and Aslan reassures her that she will be able to read it again.|$|E
25|$|Since {{eukaryotic}} genomes contain many repetitive regions, a major limitation to {{this class}} of sequencing methods is the length of <b>reads</b> <b>it</b> produces. Briefly, second generation sequencing works by first amplifying the DNA molecule and then conducting sequencing by synthesis. The collective fluorescent signal resulting from synthesizing {{a large number of}} amplified identical DNA strands allows the inference of nucleotide identity. However, due to random errors, DNA synthesis between the amplified DNA strands would become progressively out-of-sync. Quickly, the signal quality deteriorates as the read-length grows. In order to preserve read quality, long DNA molecules must be broken up into small segments, resulting in a critical limitation of second generation sequencing technologies. Computational efforts aimed to overcome this challenge often rely on approximative heuristics that may not result in accurate assemblies.|$|E
25|$|When Sharon tells Michelle that Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) {{is dying}} of cancer, in mid-2016, a guilty Michelle sends her a letter {{telling her she}} has another grandchild.

Sharon visits Michelle to learn the truth, feeling betrayed that not only had Michelle {{had sex with her}} former husband, but also lied about Mark's paternity. When Sharon returns to Walford in August, Phil finds the letter and discovers that Mark (Ned Porteous) is his brother Grant's son. Sharon begs Phil not to tell Mark, but Phil drunkenly calls him. Mark then arrives in Walford, though Michelle claims that Phil is lying because he is an {{alcoholic}} who hates her. Mark eventually learns the truth, but Sharon convinces him not to tell Michelle that he knows.|$|E

25|$|The {{books of}} those that wrote before us survive, and {{therefore}} we are taught about what was written then. For this reason it is good that we also in our time, here among us, write some material from scratch, inspired by the example of these old customs; so that it might, when we are dead and elsewhere, {{be left to the}} world's ear in the time coming after this. But because men say, and it's true, that when someone writes entirely about wisdom, it often dulls a man's wit who <b>reads</b> <b>it</b> every day. For that reason, if you permit it, I would like to take the middle way, and write a book between the two, somewhat of passion, somewhat of instruction, that whether of high or low status, people may like what I write about.|$|E
25|$|Still {{believing that}} Belle disobeyed him by {{breaking}} her {{promise not to}} leave, Beast locks her into the dungeons to rot. But when Forte goads him into destroying the rose to end his suffering, Beast finds Belle's book in the West Wing and <b>reads</b> <b>it,</b> coming to his senses and realizing that all Belle wants is {{for him to be}} happy. Releasing Belle from the dungeon and asking for her forgiveness, Beast prepares to join in the Christmas festivities. But Forte doesn't give up and even goes as far as to attempt to destroy the entire castle with Beethoven's 5th. Fortunately, Beast finds him in time and destroys his keyboard with Franz Schubert's Symphony No 8. Losing his balance (and his pipes), Forte falls from the wall he is leaned up against and is silenced forever. Later, the castle and servants are arrayed in Christmas decorations when Belle and the Beast do their famous ballroom dance from the first film.|$|E
25|$|In China, Professor Max Epper (known as Wizard) is {{investigating}} the tomb of Chinese Philosopher Laozi, owner of the Philosopher's Stone. With his research partner, Yobu 'Tank' Tanaka, Wizard discovers the cryptic message referring to the Tartarus Sunspot {{and the use of}} the Sa-Benben, or Firestone, the top piece of the Capstone from the previous book. They find another message, saying that the first pillar must be laid 100 days before the Return. Wizard sends a coded message to Jack West in Australia, just before a contingent of Chinese military arrive to capture them, intended to use Wizard's knowledge to find the Six Sacred Stones. Jack West receives Wizard's message, just before the farm is attacked by the Chinese army, participating in the Talisman Sabre military exercises. West escapes to the Halicarnassus, his private plane, with Lily, whom he adopted at the end of the previous book; Alby Calvin, Lily's friend; Zoe and Sky Monster, who are visiting the farm.
