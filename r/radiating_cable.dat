30|$|In [7], {{a typical}} {{narrowband}} propagation model for <b>radiating</b> <b>cable</b> systems is reported which {{takes into account}} the coupling and longitudinal losses of the <b>radiating</b> <b>cable.</b> At the same time, the slow and fast variations of the received signal levels are modeled by a log-normal distribution and a Rayleigh or Rician distribution, respectively. In the case of the signal being considered as a narrowband signal, such mentioned propagation models could be sufficient to design and study a <b>radiating</b> <b>cable</b> system. However, if a digital communication is being considered with high speed of data transmission, it is necessary to study the frequency response and the rms delay spread of the channel. In this context, little {{attention has been paid to}} such issues in <b>radiating</b> <b>cable</b> systems. For example, in [7] and [8], only the rms delay spread values have been reported and not it’s modeling. The frequency response modeling allows classifying the channel as frequency selective or flat fading channel by calculating the coherence bandwidth, and the rms delay spread allows knowing the limits of the transmission rate. This fact is very important in most modern technologies because such technologies require wide bandwidths and high-transmission rate. In summary, a wideband propagation model allows knowing some system characteristics, for example, the frequency selectivity, intersymbol interference, and error floor.|$|E

However, it is well-known that, for indoor wireless communications, constructive and destructive interferences have a crucial effect on the signal being transmitted.

The slot was realized in four different embodiments, which varied by slot orientation and length. Three orthogonal polarizations of radiated electric field were analyzed along the axis perpendicular to cable, broadside to the slot, in a broadband frequency range (80 - 1000 MHz). The analysis was based on thorough measurements of the coupling loss, which is the common parameter for the leaky cable characterization. The obtained {{results showed that the}} electric field component longitudinal to the cable axis considerably dominates over other two orthogonal components, for all four slot types. Doubling the length of the slot caused a ca. 20 dB increase of the radiated field. Different slot orientations, having the same length in the cross-section projection, yielded approximately equal field strengths. The results of this experimental study clearly and visibly demonstrate the radiating slot field dependence on polarization and slot geometry in a wide frequency range. Thus they are useful for planning of wireless communication systems based on <b>radiating</b> <b>cables,</b> as well as for understanding polarization related issues in such systems...|$|R

Furthermore, the impulse responses finish in a similar time. This fact explains the different mean values obtained from the rms delay spread for every room (Figure  6).

It is demonstrated that the use of a second-order model provides a better representation of the behavior of the channel. In this context, the coherence bandwidth and the rms delay spread show dependence with the receiver position along the <b>radiating</b> <b>cable</b> length. This dependence is crucial and must be taken into account in the design and study of broadband systems with mobility because the rms delay spread and coherence bandwidth are used to describe the time dispersion and the frequency selectivity of the multipath fading channels, respectively.|$|E

30|$|A <b>radiating</b> <b>cable</b> or {{leaky feeder}} is a coaxial cable where the outer {{conductor}} has been slotted, allowing radiation to occur along the cable length for uniform coverage. Thus, radiating cables {{are used to}} distribute radio waves in sites where common antennas fail, besides being used as part of wireless systems such as radio detection systems and wireless indoor-positioning systems [5, 6]. In recent years, the use of radiating cables has increased especially to provide cellular coverage in train and underground stations for which either macrocell penetration or an indoor distributed antenna system is not suitable. The coverage footprint provided by a <b>radiating</b> <b>cable</b> can normally be better shaped, thus filling in coverage holes in specific corridor scenarios much better than antennas and better containing leakage [3]. As prices are coming down in the manufacturing and installation of radiating cables, indoor radio solutions that include <b>radiating</b> <b>cable</b> are thus a very viable alternative nowadays. However, as stated in [3], antennas are more suitable to provide coverage {{in areas where the}} installation of radiating cables is much harder or unfeasible. On the other hand, the installation of radiating cables is a more sophisticated procedure and more costly than that of antenna installation. If coverage is to be focused on a specific area, the radiation characteristics of directional antennas can be utilized to maximize such coverage in the desired location, something that is much harder to achieve with the use of radiating cables. In summary, although radiating cables are a good alternative for some specific indoor environments such as corridors, there are other instances where antennas still are the preferred choice.|$|E

The noise appeared even when the spacecraft power was turned off, leading us to conclude that it must have <b>radiated</b> from <b>cables</b> connected to the controllers. For the possible worst-case scenario, in which noise from the spacecraft at the 2.5 -m distance is comparable to the environmental noise, we estimated the noise to be lower than 100 pT/√(Hz), except for a narrow-band enhancement at 7  Hz. If we assume that the noise decreases as the cube of the distance from the spacecraft center, it is estimated to be below 9 pT/√(Hz) at the MGF-S position after MAST deployment, which is comparable to the noise of the MGF instrument itself, as shown in Fig.  5. Moreover, it is one order of magnitude below the required noise level (80 pT/√(Hz)) described in [...] "Requirements for the MGF" [...] section.|$|R

FSS is the combination of either conducting patches or apertures in a thin conducting sheet arranged periodically in one or two dimensional array. FSS possess frequency selective behavior based on the element geometry. Patch type of FSS exhibits total reflection around resonant frequency whereas aperture type exhibits total transmission. This thesis presents the modelling, simulation, fabrication and test measurements of the FSS that is transparent to GSM and UMTS frequency band. FSS with a double square loop aperture as a unit cell is selected for the analysis. The modelling and simu-lation of the FSS are carried out in the Computer Simulation Technology (CST) micro-wave studio, 2012 version. FSS prototype is fabricated using the commercial available aluminum foil. Furthermore, the FSS prototype is tested in the laboratory as well as in real-time networks. The real-time or field measurement is conducted in the real networks for all three operators of Finland, namely DNA, Elisa and TeliaSonera. The laboratory result shows the resonant frequency shift downwards by a factor of 1. 22 comparing to the simulation results of freestanding FSS. The reason behind such frequency shift is well explained by the presence of a dielectric substrate in FSS prototype. On average, for all operators the field measurement result shows the transmission improvement of around 10 dB and 4. 5 dB in GSM and UMTS band respectively over the plain aluminum foil. Although the field measurement result does not show much improvement compared to the laboratory measurement result, it still prevails the possibility of using FSS for indoor coverage improvement...|$|R

Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy showed that MICAL-L 2 specifically bound to the GTP-bound form of Rab 13 via its C terminus, which contained a coiled-coil domain, and localized at TJs in epithelial MTD- 1 A cells. Recycling assay demonstrated that a MICAL-L 2 mutant lacking the Rab 13 -binding domain (MICAL-L 2 -N) specifically inhibited the endocytic recycling of occludin but not transferrin receptor.
