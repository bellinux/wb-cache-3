40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{presence}} of non-condensable gases inside a compression vapour <b>refrigerating</b> <b>circuit</b> introduces an additional thermal resistance at the condenser, which can significantly decrease the energy efficiency of the system. However, this problem so far has been investigated mainly for shell and tube condensers of large capacity and limited information is available on small systems, as is the case for household appliances where the internal volumes are extremely reduced and therefore a very small amount of non-condensable gas has large effect. Moreover, non-condensable gas behaves differently when condensation takes place outside tubes (shell and tube condensers) or inside tubes (condensers of small appliances); in the first case all heat transfer area is wrapped by a gas layer, whereas in the second case non-condensable gas is collected {{at the end of the}} tube. The effect of non-condensable gas in this work is experimentally investigated by injecting controlled amounts of air into a <b>refrigerating</b> <b>circuit</b> and by recording the thermal and electric variables during different modes of operation (steady state and cyclic running). The tested refrigerating circuits are part of two appliances on the market, a household refrigerator and a vertical freezer. The presence of non-condensable gas was found to spoil energy efficiency, since it brings about an increase in condensing pressure and a concomitant decrease in evaporating temperature, although larger liquid subcooling partially compensates for the first negative effects: the reason for this behaviour is the clogging action of bubbles of gaseous mixture (air and refrigerant vapour) that enter the capillary tube...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{internal}} heat transfer between suction line and gas-cooler outlet line is investigated experimentally in a transcritical carbon dioxide <b>refrigerating</b> <b>circuit.</b> The test rig {{is equipped with}} a semihermetic two-stage reciprocating compound compressor with a water cooled inter-stage heat exchanger and with a finned coil gas-cooler and evaporator. Fixed evaporation pressure was considered, while vapour superheating was varied from 0 °C to 14 °C. Two-phase conditions at the evaporator outlet were also investigated. Gas-cooler outlet pressure was varied from 7. 8 to 11 MPa. The experimental results are compared with available experimental data for the same system without internal heat exchange. The effect of the intercooler efficiency on the cycle performance is also investigated. The system Coefficient of Performance was found to increase up to 20 %. Some hints about the effect of low-purity carbon dioxide on system efficiency are also proposed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to investigate, both {{experimentally}} and theoretically, the potential of improving the cycle efficiency through two stage compression with intermediate cooling, at operating conditions typical of air conditioning. The experimental set-up consists of two closed loop air circuits acting as heat sink and heat source for gas-cooler and evaporator respectively. The tested <b>refrigerating</b> <b>circuit</b> includes two tube-and-fin heat exchangers as gas-cooler and evaporator, a back-pressure valve as throttling device and a double-stage semi-hermetic compound, two-piston, reciprocating compressor equipped with oil separator and intercooler. A full set of thermocouples, pressure transducers and flow-meters allows measurement of all the main parameters of the CO 2 cycle, enabling to perform heat balance both air and refrigerant side. Tests were run at fixed evaporation pressure, evaporator outlet superheating and gas-cooler outlet temperature, varying the gas-cooler outlet pressure in the range 8 - 11 MPa. The optimal gas-cooler pressure for this application as well as the effect of the intercooler efficiency on the cycle performance were investigated. A FORTRAN code for the simulation of an improved two-stage cycle was validated against the experimental results; a theoretical analysis performed with this code is proposed for optimisation and energy performance evaluation of such a cycle...|$|E
40|$|A {{quantity}} {{of up to}} 4000 m 3 /h of water is used at CERN for cooling purposes: experiments, magnets and radio frequency cavities are <b>refrigerated</b> by closed <b>circuits</b> filled with deionized water; other utilities, such as air-conditioning, use chilled/hot water, also in closed circuits. All these methods all employ a cold source, the primary supply of water, coming from the cooling towers. About 500 kCHF are spent every year on water treatment {{in order to keep}} the water within these networks in operational conditions. In the line of further rationalization of resources, the next generation of contracts with the water treatment industry will aim for improved performance and better monitoring of quality related parameters in this context. The author will provide a concise report based upon an examination of the state of the installations and of the philosophy followed up until now for water treatment. Furthermore, he/she will propose a new approach from both a technical and contractual point of view, in preparation for a call for tender which is foreseen to be issued during 1999. As the water tower circuits (primary water) are quantitatively dominating, the technical discussion will concentrate mainly on problems linked with these networks...|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} {{simulation model}} of a packaged air cooled water chiller was developed. The nominal cooling capacity of the chiller is about 70 kW at 35 °C dry bulb outdoor air temperature, and it consists of a single <b>refrigerating</b> <b>circuit</b> with two identical scroll compressors. The compressor was characterised by its experimental performance curve according to EN 12900 for both R 410 A and R 32. Off-the-shelf copper tubes and louvered aluminium fins were considered for the condenser and typical brazed plate configurations for the evaporator. The finned coil condenser and the brazed plate heat exchanger evaporator were modelled by an elementary finite volumes technique, previously validated in other papers; for each volume the heat transfer coefficient and the pressure drop were calculated using semi-empirical correlations chosen among the most accurate ones available in the open literature. The aim of the paper is to compare the performance of R 410 A with that of R 32 which is considered as a possible HFC substitute with lower GWP (675 instead of 2088). The condenser was optimised for R 410 A and R 32 independently {{with regard to the}} number of internal circuits according to the so-called Performance Evaluation Criteria [1], without changing the overall heat exchanger dimensions. An analysis of the seasonal efficiency for each finned coil circuitry configuration (both with the same compressors) was carried out in terms of European Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (ESEER) calculated according to the EN 14825 specifications for water chillers. We were able to conclude from that modelling work, that R 32 system efficiency performance is acceptable as alternative to R 410 for water chillers and further simulation analyses will include evaluating HFO blends...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is twofold: first, to compare the {{performance}} of R 410 A with that of R 32, which is considered a possible HFC substitute with lower global warming potential (675 instead of 2088); second, to exploit the effect of the circuit length in the finned coil of a packaged air-to-water reversible unit with given water plate heat exchanger and scroll compressor. Both scopes are pursued through the analysis of a case study, a system with nominal cooling capacity of about 74 kW at 35 ◦C dry-bulb outdoor air temperature and a nominal heating capacity of about 70 kW at 2 ◦C dry-bulb and 1 ◦C wet-bulb ambient temperature. The performance of the two refrigerants inside a “real” machine is simulated by means of an advanced numerical model of a packaged reversible refrigeration unit. The system consists of a single <b>refrigerating</b> <b>circuit</b> with two identical scroll compressors. The compressor was characterized by its experimental performance curve according to Standard EN 12900 (EN 2013 a) for both R 410 A and R 32. Off-the-shelf copper tubes and louvered aluminum fins were considered for the condenser and typical brazed-plate heat exchanger for the evaporator of the chiller configuration. The finned coil heat exchanger was first thermodynamically optimized for R 410 A and R 32 for both condenser and evaporator operation with regard to the number of internal circuits according to the total temperature penalization performance evaluation criteria (Cavallini et al. 2010; Brown et al. 2013), without changing the overall heat exchanger dimensions. The effect of finned coil circuit length on the performance of the investigated reversible unit with the two refrigerants was then analyzed at nominal design conditions and under a seasonal perspective. Based on the modeling work, it is possible to conclude that R 32 system efficiency performance is acceptable as alternative to R 410 A for packaged air-to-water reversible unit...|$|E
40|$|In CO 2 {{transcritical}} refrigeration cycles fin-and-tube coils {{are still}} considered as possible gas cooling devices, {{due to their}} lower cost when compared with recent aluminium minichannel heat exchangers. In spite of the very high working pressures, an “off-the-shelf” coil with four ranks of 3 / 8 ” copper tube and louvered fins was found suitable to work with high R 744 pressures and has been studied as a gas-cooler in a test rig built for testing CO 2 equipment operating with air as a secondary fluid. The test rig consists of two closed loop air circuits acting as heat sink and heat source for gas-cooler and evaporator respectively. The tested <b>refrigerating</b> <b>circuit</b> consists of two tube-and-fin heat exchangers as the gas-cooler and the evaporator, a back-pressure valve as the throttling device, a double-stage compound compressor equipped with an oil separator and an intercooler. A full set of thermocouples, pressure transducers and flow-meters allows measurement and recording of all the main parameters of the CO 2 cycle, enabling to perform heat balance both air-side and refrigerant-side. Tests were focused on two different gas-coolers, with continuous and cut fins, and on two different circuit arrangements. Tests on each heat exchanger were run at three different inlet conditions, both for CO 2 and air. A simulation model was developed {{for this type of}} heat exchanger and three models (Dang and Hihara 2004, Gnielinski 1976, Pitla et al. 2002) proposed for the carbon dioxide supercritical cooling heat transfer coefficients were implemented and compared in the code. The model results are compared with the experimental data for the finned coil: emphasis is given to the effect of heat conduction through fins between adjacent tube ranks on the system efficiency. In the paper, the experimental results for transcritical carbon dioxide entering the gas cooler at 87. 0 °C (7. 911 MPa), 97. 6 °C (8. 599 MPa), 107. 8 °C (9. 102 MPa) with air inlet temperature 20. 3 °C, 21. 5 °C and 23. 0 °C respectively are presented. By using a coil with fins modified to reduce the heat conduction, a 3. 7 % to 5. 6 % heat flux improvement was gained. This improvement can be clearly translated in terms of Coefficient Of Performance, since a low value of the CO 2 temperature at its outlet increases the cooling capacity. Considering a reference cycle with the same operating conditions, a 5. 7 % to 6. 6 % increase of COP can be obtained...|$|E
