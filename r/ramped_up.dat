5|$|During the Boer War, the {{importance}} of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents was paramount, {{and the use of}} wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company Mappin & Webb began production of their successful 'campaign watch' for soldiers during the campaign at the Sudan in 1898 and <b>ramped</b> <b>up</b> production for the Boer War a few years later.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak ordered 26 E60s in 1973; 15 on March 26, 1973, and {{a further}} 11 on October 12. The {{total cost of}} the order was $18.4 million. The initial order was for 15 {{locomotives}} with steam generators and 11 with head-end power, but 9 of the first type were switched to using head-end power as Amtrak <b>ramped</b> <b>up</b> acquisition of Amfleet cars. Amtrak anticipated that E60-hauled Amfleet trains could displace both the GG1s and the mechanically-unreliable Metroliners.|$|E
5|$|On 17 October 1933, {{aviation}} pioneer Hugo Junkers, {{owner of}} the Junkers Aircraft Works, was arrested {{and within a few}} days his company was expropriated by the regime. In concert with other aircraft manufacturers and under the direction of Aviation Minister Göring, production was immediately <b>ramped</b> <b>up</b> industry-wide. From a workforce of 3,200 people producing 100 units per year in 1932, the industry grew to employ {{a quarter of a million}} workers manufacturing over 10,000 technically advanced aircraft per year less than ten years later.|$|E

The study was done in a hot wall chemical vapor deposition reactor using the single molecule precursor methyltrichlorosilane (MTS). During the temperature <b>ramp</b> <b>up,</b> a small flow of HCl or C 2 H 4 was added to the H 2 ambient to study different surface etching conditions.

5|$|The need {{to acquire}} or produce extra landing craft and troop carrier {{aircraft}} for the expanded operation {{meant that the}} invasion had to be delayed to June. Production of landing craft was <b>ramped</b> <b>up</b> in late 1943 and continued into early 1944, and existing craft were relocated from other theaters. More than 600 Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft and their crews took a circuitous route to England in early 1944 from Baer Field, Indiana, bringing the number of available troop carrier planes to over a thousand.|$|E
5|$|In {{starting}} a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or <b>ramped</b> <b>up</b> to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is <b>ramped</b> <b>up,</b> a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, is injected {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E

30|$|For {{changes in}} temperature, the {{viscosity}} initially increases {{as the temperature}} <b>ramps</b> <b>up</b> then decreases after the inflection point. This temperature effect occurs prominently at lower shear rates and lessens at higher shear rates above 10  s− 1. This <b>ramp</b> <b>up</b> in viscosity implies the entanglement of the wormlike micelles until the competing effect of temperature initiates micellar branching.|$|R
5|$|The {{first film}} {{screening}} in Turkey was at Yıldız Palace in 1896, {{a year after}} the technology publicly debuted in Paris. Movie theaters rapidly cropped up in Beyoğlu, with the greatest concentration of theaters being along the street now known as İstiklal Avenue. Istanbul also became the heart of Turkey's nascent film industry, although Turkish films were not consistently developed until the 1950s. Since then, Istanbul has been the most popular location to film Turkish dramas and comedies. The Turkish film industry <b>ramped</b> <b>up</b> {{in the second half of}} the century, and with Uzak (2002) and My Father and My Son (2005), both filmed in Istanbul, the nation's movies began to see substantial international success. Istanbul and its picturesque skyline have also served as a backdrop for several foreign films, including Topkapi (1964), The World Is Not Enough (1999), and Mission Istaanbul (2008).|$|E
5|$|The {{increasingly}} unpopular war in Korea dragged on, and the Truman {{administration was}} beset {{with a series}} of corruption scandals. He eventually decided not to run for re-election. Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic candidate in the 1952 presidential election, attempted to distance himself from the President as much as possible. The election was won by the Republican candidate, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose administration <b>ramped</b> <b>up</b> the pressure on the Chinese in Korea with conventional bombing and renewed threats of using nuclear weapons. Coupled with a more favorable international political climate {{in the wake of the}} death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, this led the Chinese and North Koreans to agree to terms. The belief that the threat of nuclear weapons played an important part in the outcome would lead to their threatened use against China on a number of occasions during the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Again, the day's {{principal}} breakaway {{was given}} a large time gap. After , Andrey Amador, Davide Malacarne, Mathew Hayman, Fabian Wegmann and Jens Mouris had a lead of over 11 minutes. The parcours began to take its toll at this point, and as the chase <b>ramped</b> <b>up</b> in the peloton, the time gap fell precipitously. By the time the ascent of the Sasso Tetto began, Mouris was gapped off and lost {{more and more time}} as the day went on, eventually finishing 21 minutes behind the stage winner. Hayman and Wegmann kept the pace for a while, and Wegmann won the day's second climb, the Camerino at , but eventually only Amador and Malacarne were left out front. The second group on the road eventually reduced itself to just a select group of overall favorites and contenders. Amador attacked first on the finishing circuit, but Malacarne made the bridge. Instead of working together to stay away and let a two-up sprint decide the stage winner, Amador and Malacarne sat on one another's wheels and let their rapidly falling advantage dwindle even further. From the elite group of contenders, Pinotti put in an attack on an uphill section of the finishing circuit that effectively gapped off race leader Robert Gesink, who had used up all of his support riders at this point. Gesink finished 17 seconds back on the day, losing the race leadership.|$|E

5|$|Parker's injury {{extended}} into {{the beginning of}} the 2015–16 NBA season. He returned to action on November 4 against the Philadelphia 76ers in the fifth game of the season for the Bucks but struggled, posting just two points in 16 minutes as a starter. As he <b>ramped</b> <b>up</b> his activity, he was rested on the second of back-to-back games. Nonetheless, after five games, he endured a sprain in his talonavicular joint in the right mid-foot causing him to be expected to miss several games. He only missed one game. The following week, he began to come off the bench while O. J. Mayo took his starting spot. On December 12, Parker had a 19-point, 7-rebound, 2-steal performance against the Golden State Warriors to help end their 24-game win streak. On January 27, 2016, he was named to the 2016 NBA All-Star Game weekend Rising Stars Challenge lineup. On February 19, he tied his career high with 23 points in a loss to the Charlotte Hornets. He surpassed that total the following night, recording career highs of 28 points and 13 rebounds in a 117–109 double-overtime win over the Atlanta Hawks. On February 29, Parker set a new career high with 36 points in a 128–121 Bucks victory over the Houston Rockets.|$|E
