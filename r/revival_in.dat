5|$|Another peace {{agreement}} between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans lasted until 1552, when Suleiman decided to attack Eger. The siege proved futile, and the Habsburg victory reversed a period of territorial losses in Hungary. Their retention of Eger gave the Austrians {{good reason to believe}} that Hungary was still contested ground and the Ottoman campaign in Hungary ended, until its <b>revival</b> <b>in</b> 1566.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{helped to}} lead a <b>revival</b> <b>in</b> tennis known {{by many as the}} Golden Age. This led to {{increased}} interest in the sport, which in turn led to higher revenues for many venues across tennis. During this period rising revenues led to exploding prize money; when Federer first won the Australian Open in 2004 he earned $985,000, compared to when he won in 2017 and the prize had increased to $2,774,000.|$|E
5|$|Greek-style homes {{gave way}} to Gothic <b>Revival</b> <b>in</b> the 1830s, which {{emphasized}} pointed arches, steep gable roofs, towers and tracer-lead windows. The Freemason Baptist Church and St. Mary's Catholic Church are examples of Gothic Revival. Italianate elements emerged in the 1840s including cupolas, verandas, ornamental brickwork, or corner quoins. Norfolk still had simple wooden structures among its more ornate buildings.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} evidence of a <b>revival</b> <b>in</b> Gothic architecture is from Scotland. Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 with design input from William Adam, displays the incorporation of turrets. These were largely conventional Palladian style houses that incorporated some external features of the Scots Baronial style.|$|E

5|$|The Assemblies of God has {{roots in}} the Pentecostal <b>revival</b> <b>in</b> the early 20th century. The Pentecostal aspects of the revival were not {{generally}} welcomed by the established churches, and participants in the movement soon found themselves outside existing religious bodies. They were forced to seek their own places of worship, and soon {{there were hundreds of}} distinctly Pentecostal congregations.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of Tablighi Jamaat represented {{the intensification of}} individual reformation aspects of the original Deobandi movement. It was also {{a continuation of the}} broader trend of Islamic <b>revival</b> <b>in</b> India {{in the wake of the}} collapse of Muslim political power to the Maratha Empire and the subsequent consolidation of the British rule.|$|E
5|$|The {{new wealth}} being {{generated}} {{during this period}} had {{a positive impact on}} Byzantine cultural life. In artistic terms, the twelfth century was a very productive period in Byzantine history. There was a <b>revival</b> <b>in</b> the mosaic art, and regional schools of Architecture began producing many distinctive styles that drew on a range of cultural influences.|$|E

5|$|While a {{critical}} success, Citizen Kane failed to recoup its costs {{at the box}} office. The film faded from view after its release but was subsequently returned to the public's attention when it was praised by such French critics as André Bazin and given an American <b>revival</b> <b>in</b> 1956. The film was released on Blu-ray on September 13, 2011, for a special 70th anniversary edition.|$|E
5|$|A beefsteak {{is a type}} of banquet {{in which}} sliced beef {{tenderloin}} is served to diners as all-you-can-eat finger food. The dining style originated in 19th-century New York City as a type of working-class celebration but went into a decline in the mid-20th century. Resurrected by caterers in New Jersey, the beefsteak banquet style is now popular in that state's Bergen and Passaic counties, and is enjoying a <b>revival</b> <b>in</b> New York City, where the style originated, due to the reemergence of a biannual beefsteak in Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{returned}} to the Exchange in Swansea to film two more scenes: The denouément of the episode was filmed on 28 July; and the pre-credits sequence on 30 July. The most important day of filming was on 31 July 2007: an evening location shoot of the party's arrival in London. Before filming commenced, Minogue covered her death scene above a chroma key mattress. The scene in London commenced filming at sunset in Cardiff city centre. For security concerns—specifically, protecting Minogue—the street was sealed off {{for the first time}} since the show's <b>revival</b> <b>in</b> 2005.|$|E
5|$|For millennia, archery {{has played}} a pivotal role in Chinese history. Because the {{cultures}} associated with Chinese society spanned a wide geography and time range, the techniques and equipment associated with Chinese archery are diverse. Historical sources and archaeological evidence suggest that a variety of bow designs existed throughout Chinese history. For much of the 20th century, only one Chinese traditional bow and arrow making workshop was active. However, {{in the beginning of the}} 21st century, there has been <b>revival</b> <b>in</b> interest among craftsmen looking to construct bows and arrows in the traditional Chinese style.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} eighteenth century Scotland gained many of the organisations {{associated}} with the <b>revival</b> <b>in</b> England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. Because the revival occurred {{at the same time as}} the transformation of the Highlands into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid the ground for the Great Disruption in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to the Evangelicals taking control of the General Assembly and those in the Highlands joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers.|$|E
