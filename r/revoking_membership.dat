50|$|In 1967 Campbell was {{appointed}} as the Canadian ambassador to NATO. As {{part of his}} appointment {{he served as a}} Canada's representative on NATO's Nuclear Planning Group. He was known as a blunt-spoken diplomat who believed in the Cold War realities of NATO. This came {{at a time when the}} Liberal cabinet led by Pierre Trudeau questioned the value of NATO and contemplated <b>revoking</b> <b>membership</b> within the alliance. Campbell was firm in his view that without NATO, the Soviet Union would have opportunity to overthrow the countries of Western Europe. Campbell held that NATO existed to preserve European territorial integrity, security, and social and economic well-being. Further, Campbell argued that NATO acted as Canada's admission card to the negotiating tables of the Western Alliance. After his NATO assignment ended in 1972, Campbell {{was appointed}} as the ambassador to Japan.|$|E

40|$|There {{is a wide}} {{cross-country}} {{variation in}} the institutional structure of bank failure resolution, including {{the role of the}} deposit insurer. The authors use quantitative analysis for 57 countries and discuss specific country cases to illustrate this variation. Using data for over 1, 700 banks across 57 countries, they show that banks in countries where the deposit insurer has the responsibility of intervening failed banks and the power to <b>revoke</b> <b>membership</b> in the deposit insurance scheme are more stable and less likely to become insolvent. Involvement of the deposit insurer in bank failure resolution thus dampens the negative effect that deposit insurance has on banks'risk taking.

40|$|In this paper, we outline an {{approach}} to the identification of entities for access control {{that is based on}} the membership of groups, rather than individuals. By using group membership as a level of indirection between the individual and the system, we can increase privacy and provide incentives for better behaviour. Privacy comes from the use of pseudonyms generated within the group and which can be authenticated as belonging to the group. The incentives for better behaviour come from the continuous nature of groups - members may come and go, but the group lives on, and groups are organised so as to ensure group-longevity, and prevent actions which may harm the groups reputation. We present a novel pseudonym generation mechanism suitable for use in groups without a centralised administration. Finally, we argue that the use of group membership as the basis for formulating policies on interaction is more efficient for disconnected operation, facilitating proxies and the efficient storage of <b>revoked</b> <b>membership</b> and distrusted organisations within bloom filters for small memory footprints...|$|R
