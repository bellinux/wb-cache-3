5|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E

500|$|Bryan Enk, {{writing for}} UGO, {{states that the}} myth-making story of Söze's origins is a classic ghost story that would be right at home in horror fiction. Writing about psychopaths in film, {{academic}} Wayne Wilson explicitly compares Söze to Satan and assigns to him demonic motives. Wilson states that Söze allows himself to be caught just to prove his superiority over the police; this compromises his ultimate goal of anonymity, but Söze can not <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> to show off and create mischief. In The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, Lewis Call states that Söze's mythological status draws the ire of the authoritarian government agents because he [...] "represents a terrifying truth: that power is ephemeral, and has no basis in reality." [...] According to Call, Söze's intermediaries – the [...] "usual suspects" [...] themselves – are more useful to the police, as they represent an easily controlled and intimidated criminal underworld, in direct contrast to Söze himself.|$|E
500|$|When public {{relations}} specialist Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) departs from an unsuccessful meeting pitching his All-Heart logo for corporations who are extraordinarily charitable, he becomes trapped on railroad tracks with an incoming freight train. Hancock saves Ray's life but he causes {{the train to}} derail and nearly injures another driver. Hancock is jeered by other drivers for causing more damage but Ray steps in and publicly thanks Hancock for saving his life. Ray invites him home for dinner with his wife, Mary ( [...] Charlize Theron), and their son, Aaron, during which Ray offers to improve Hancock's public image. Hancock goes back home to ponder the offer and returns to his house {{the next day and}} grudgingly accepts. Ray convinces the alcoholic superhero to agree to be jailed for outstanding warrants so they can show Los Angeles how much the city really needs Hancock. Hancock tries to <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> to break out of jail using his powers and refuses to talk during a prison group therapy but frequent visits by Ray and his family encouraged him to be patient. When crime rates rise after Hancock's incarceration, the superhero is contacted by the Chief of Police. Reluctantly donning a new costume (which has been provided by Ray), Hancock foils a bank robbery and aids a wounded officer. He prevents Red Parker (Eddie Marsan) from detonating explosive-laden vests attached to the bank hostages, by slicing off his hand (which was holding onto a [...] "deadman's switch").|$|E
500|$|Critics had widely {{divergent}} {{views of}} Sue's storyline. Keller wrote, [...] "They made Sue Sylvester into a cartoon character."

While Canning also noted the shift in tone [...] "from despicable Sue to cartoony evil Sue", he enjoyed her [...] "attempt to hijack Secret Santa", and said it was [...] "another fun reason to love to hate Sue Sylvester". Hankinson felt that the Grinch was [...] "the perfect touchstone for the heartless Ms. Sylvester and Jane Lynch's lanky frame made the physical humor (think gliding around the base of the tree on her belly) really sing." [...] Poniewozik called Sue's transformation [...] "pretty amusing to watch", admitted that he doubted he would [...] "have been able to <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> to put the rangy Jane Lynch in that classic role" [...] and called Brittany as Cindy Lou Who [...] "unexpected, clever and surprisingly touching". Several reviewers commented favorably on Becky playing Max, including Canning, who wrote [...] "it was all worth it to realize Becky is and always will be the Max to Sue's Grinch", and Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack declared, [...] "I totally love how Becky is becoming Sue’s little minion. It’s both adorable and hilarious." ...|$|E

2500|$|Impulse control {{disorder}} (ICDs) are a {{class of}} DSM diagnoses that do not fall into the other diagnostic categories of the manual (e.g. substance use disorders), and that are characterized by extreme difficulty controlling impulses or urges despite negative consequences. [...] Individuals suffering from an impulse control disorder frequently experience five stages of symptoms: compelling urge or desire, failure to <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>urge,</b> {{a heightened sense of}} arousal, succumbing to the urge (which usually yields relief from tension), and potential remorse or feelings of guilt after the behavior is completed. Specific disorders included within this category include intermittent explosive disorder, kleptomania, pathological gambling, pyromania, trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder), and impulse control disorders not otherwise specified (ICD NOS). ICD NOS includes other significant difficulties that seem to be related to impulsivity but do not meet the criteria for a specific DSM diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|Gandalf and {{the entire}} company then go to Orthanc. [...] Théoden rejects Saruman's offer of peace despite the wizard's cunning words. [...] Gandalf then offers Saruman a chance to repent, but Saruman is too proud and refuses. [...] So Gandalf casts Saruman out of the Order of Wizards and the White Council and breaks his staff. Gríma throws {{something}} from a window at Gandalf but misses, and it is picked up by Pippin. [...] Gandalf quickly takes it from Pippin. This object {{turns out to be}} one of the palantíri (seeing-stones). Pippin, unable to <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>urge,</b> looks into it and encounters the Eye of Sauron, but emerges unscathed from the ordeal. Gandalf then realizes at last the link between Isengard and Mordor and how Saruman fell at last into evil. [...] By looking into the palantír, Saruman became ensnared by the Dark Lord and made to do Sauron's bidding. [...] Gandalf then gives the palantír to Aragorn.|$|E

2500|$|Ridgway {{confessed to}} more {{confirmed}} murders {{than any other}} American serial killer. Over a period of five months of police and prosecutor interviews, he confessed to 48 murders—42 of which were on the police's list of probable Green River Killer victims. On February 9, 2004, county prosecutors began to release the videotape records of Ridgway's confessions. In one taped interview, he told investigators initially that {{he was responsible for}} the deaths of 65 women, but in another taped interview with Reichert on December 31, 2003, Ridgway claimed to have murdered 71 victims and confessed to having had sex with them before killing them, a detail which he did not reveal until after his sentencing. In his confession, he acknowledged that he targeted sex workers because they were [...] "easy to pick up" [...] and that he [...] "hated most of them." [...] He confessed that he had sex with his victims' bodies after he murdered them, but claimed he began burying the later victims so that he could <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> to commit necrophilia.|$|E
2500|$|Louise {{is now a}} young woman, and Rose {{has built}} a pale {{imitation}} of the Dainty June act for her. Using all girls, Rose and Herbie try valiantly to sell [...] "Madame Rose's Toreadorables" [...] to a fading vaudeville industry. However, they are still together ("Together, Wherever We Go"). With no vaudeville venues left, Louise and her second-rate act wind up accidentally booked at a burlesque house in Wichita, Kansas, {{as a means to}} deter police raids. Rose is anguished, as she sees what a booking in burlesque means to her dreams of success, but Louise persuades her that two weeks' pay for the new act is better than unemployment. As they are introduced to Louise, three of the strippers on the bill advise her on {{what it takes to be}} a successful stripper, a [...] "gimmick," [...] something that [...] "makes your strip special" [...] ("You Gotta Get a Gimmick"). Backstage, Rose proposes marriage to Herbie. He asks her to break up the act and let Louise have a normal life, and she reluctantly accepts, agreeing to marry the day after their show closes. On the last day of the booking, the star stripper in the burlesque show is arrested for solicitation. Desperate, Rose cannot <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> to give Louise another nudge toward stardom, and she volunteers Louise to do the strip tease as a last-minute replacement. Disgusted at Rose's blind ambition for her daughter, Herbie walks out on Rose forever ("Small World (Reprise)"). Although reluctant, Louise wants to please her mother and she goes on, assured by Rose that she needn't actually strip, but simply walk elegantly and tease by dropping a single shoulder strap. Shy and hesitant, she sings a titillating version of the old kiddie act song, [...] "May We Entertain You?". She removes only her glove, but she speaks directly to her 'audience', which becomes her [...] "gimmick" [...] ("Let Me Entertain You (Gypsy Strip Tease)").|$|E
