25|$|Many of {{the young}} Kashgari women were most {{attractive}} in appearance, {{and some of the}} little girls quite lovely, their plaits of long hair falling from under a jaunty little embroidered cap, their big dark eyes, flashing teeth and piquant olive faces <b>reminding</b> <b>me</b> of Italian or Spanish children. One most beautiful boy stands out in my memory. He was clad in a new shirt and trousers of flowered pink, his crimson velvet cap embroidered with gold, and as he smiled and salaamed to us I thought he looked like a fairy prince. The women wear their hair in two or five plaits much thickened and lengthened by the addition of yak's hair, but the children in several tiny plaits.|$|E
500|$|The second side of {{the album}} begins with [...] "Bloody Mary Morning", with the male narrator {{ordering}} drinks on a flight from Los Angeles, California to Houston, Texas after his wife unexpectedly left him, with [...] "the smog and haze <b>reminding</b> <b>me</b> of how I feel". In [...] "Phases and Stages/No Love Around" [...] he recalls dragging in at sunrise after another night of carousing: [...] "I come home last Saturday morning, I come home and found you gone." [...] In the sad [...] "I Still Can't Believe You're Gone", [...] the man realizes the vast impact on his life of her leaving. [...] "It's Not Supposed to Be That Way" [...] reflects his inability to accept the situation and his grief, but still in a self-centered way. In [...] "Heaven and Hell", the man expresses his ambivalence about living without his wife, with the lyric: [...] "Sometimes it's heaven, sometimes it's hell, and sometimes I don't even know." [...] The final track is [...] "Phases and Stages/Pick Up the Tempo/Phases and Stages", in which the man reveals his inability to change his character, and accepts his nature and its consequences.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} few years she {{revealed}} a talent for clarifying doctrine to those who had not received as much education as she. A kaleidoscope, whose three mirrors transform scraps of coloured paper into beautiful designs, provided an inspired illustration for the Holy Trinity. [...] "As long as our actions, even the smallest, do not fall away from the focus of Divine Love, the Holy Trinity, symbolized by the three mirrors, allows them to reflect wonderful beauty. Jesus, who regards us through the little lens, that is to say, through Himself, always sees beauty in everything we do. But if we left the focus of inexpressible love, what would He see? Bits of straw … dirty, worthless actions." [...] "Another cherished image was that of the newly invented elevator, a vehicle Thérèse used many times over to describe God's grace, a force that lifts us to heights we can't reach on our own." [...] Her sister Céline's memoir is filled with numerous examples of the teacher Thérèse. [...] "Céline: - 'Oh! When I think how much I have to acquire!' Thérèse: - 'Rather, how much you have to lose! Jesus Himself will fill your soul with treasures in the same measure that you move your imperfections out of the way." [...] And Céline recalled a story Thérèse told about egotism. 'The 28 month old Thérèse visited Le Mans and was given a basket filled with candies, at the top of which were two sugar rings. 'Oh! How wonderful! There is a sugar ring for Céline too!' On her way to the station however the basket overturned, and one of the sugar rings disappeared. 'Ah, I no longer have any sugar ring for poor Céline!' <b>Reminding</b> <b>me</b> of the incident she observed; 'See how deeply rooted in us is this self-love! Why was it Céline's sugar ring, and not mine, that was lost?' Martha of Jesus, a novice who spent her childhood in a series of orphanages and who was described by all as emotionally unbalanced, with a violent temper, gave witness during the beatification process of the 'unusual dedication and presence of her young teacher. [...] "Thérèse deliberately 'sought out the company of those nuns whose temperaments she found hardest to bear.' What merit was there in acting charitably toward people whom one loved naturally? Thérèse went {{out of her way to}} spend time with, and therefore to love, the people she found repellent. It was an effective means of achieving interior poverty, a way to remove a place to rest her head." ...|$|E
