Further, past responses to past challenges are inadequate to meet the convergence of demands posed on investor owned electric utilities by new technologies, new markets, and new regulations. Instead, the twenty-first century challenge requires a dramatic new response as electric utilities face a new economic order and as they seek <b>revenue</b> protection and <b>assurances</b> of financial stability from their regulators. This article will first explore current industry characteristics and challenges in Part II. Part III will then discuss the current situation of the electricity market and investor owned electric utilities 2 ̆ 7 participation in that market. Part IV will analyze the fundamental legal claim available to utilities that the regulatory environment is devaluing their property and may constitute a constitutional taking. In Part V, a test case involving solar distributed generation and net metering {{will be presented to}} examine the types of challenges facing investor owned electric utilities as well as available responses to those challenges. Starting with Part VI, the article more broadly discusses the need to change the current regulatory compact between utilities and their regulators. Then, Part VII examines new forms of ratemaking that can be employed to implement the regulatory compact. The article concludes in Part VIII with a discussion of the shape that the utility of the future ought to take...|$|R

5000|$|... "Revenue assurance" [...] {{is a broad}} {{umbrella}} term. It is {{used both}} to describe an activity performed within telecommunications service providers, and is a common name for a small business unit associated with that activity. <b>Revenue</b> <b>assurance</b> is a practical response to perceived or actual issues with operational under performance, most commonly relating to billing and collection of revenue. Some of the procedures associated with identifying, remedying or preventing errors may be undertaken by a dedicated <b>Revenue</b> <b>Assurance</b> department, though responsibility for <b>revenue</b> <b>assurance</b> is often diffuse and varies greatly with the organizational structure of the provider. Assuming a provider with a typical organizational split, responsibilities for <b>revenue</b> <b>assurance</b> primarily sit between the Finance and Technology directorates, however, <b>revenue</b> <b>assurance</b> initiatives are often started in a business unit or marketing group.|$|E
5000|$|People Correction: People {{correction}} {{is required}} when {{skills of the}} resources are in question. <b>Revenue</b> <b>Assurance</b> is a niche business process with limited people present with {{the right amount of}} Telecom Network, Mediation, Billing, IT and Business related experience. This leads to many <b>Revenue</b> <b>Assurance</b> teams with inexperienced people on operational departments. Owing to this, most <b>Revenue</b> <b>Assurance</b> operations end up being only re-active rather than moving into a proactive foundation.|$|E
40|$|A pre–post {{case study}} was {{conducted}} to examine how target revenue funding from Texas House Bill 1 (2006) has impacted the school districts within the Texas Education Service Center Region X area. Forced by the courts, the Texas Legislature was required to fix the Texas school finance system because of a de facto statewide property tax it had created by capping school district’s maintenance & operations tax rate at $ 1. 50. Texas Governor Rick Perry used this opportunity to reduce school district M&O taxes by one-third. The Texas Legislature passed House Bill 1 (2006), the Public School Finance and Property Tax Relief Act, in response to the courts and to address a continuous decline in state funding support for public education. The Public School Finance and Property Tax Relief Act reduced local school districts’ property tax rates and <b>revenue</b> with the <b>assurance</b> that these funds would be exchanged for state aid. Local school property taxes were reduced over two years, 2006 – 2007 and 2007 - 2008, by 33 %. In order for the State of Texas to meet the state aid funding guarantee from House Bill 1 (2006), each school district was frozen to its 2005 – 2006 revenue per weighted student, which was called a district’s revenue target. This study examined the impact target revenue has had on these school districts by analyzing and comparing revenues and expenditures prior to and following the law’s implementation. Specifically, changes in per-student revenue, per-student expenditures, and district fund balances were assessed...|$|R
40|$|New Zealanders {{are driving}} nearly 30 billion {{kilometres}} {{each year in}} their cars, vans, utes and SUVs. The road network also carries 70 percent {{of all of our}} freight. As a nation we have built and continue to maintain a network of roads to allow us to make these trips. The road network is worth more than 60 billion and costs more than 1 billion a year to maintain. We are planning to invest 10 billion {{over the next ten years}} to change the shape of the network to improve its quality and capacity. This would be relatively straightforward if we knew how demand would change. The challenge we face, however, is there have recently been changes to the patterns of demand for personal travel. From 1980 to 2004 we saw an annual increase in demand in the order of three percent per year. This highlighted the importance of tackling congestion and improving safety and gave us <b>assurance</b> <b>revenue</b> would grow to cover the costs of a growing network. From 2005 to 2013 total demand only grew by 0. 25 percent per year. We now face an uncertain future. We cannot be certain demand will return to pre- 2005 levels of growth nor can we be certain it will remain flat. This means we can no longer rely on traditional forecasting models alone to help us to decide how to invest. The aim of this project was to explore the uncertainty around demand for personal travel, car travel in particular, which represents 77 percent of the total kilometres travelled on our roads. We did this by developing four future scenarios which explored the possible impact on travel of our use of digital technology and also the impact of energy costs on future travel demand. The goal was not to create predictions of the future; nor was it to create a view on what our preferences were for the future transport system. Our goal was to produce a range of plausible futures. This would allow us to improve the likelihood the investment decisions we make today will be right for the future. The conclusions of our work were: 1. 	When we think about creating a thriving New Zealand we should recognise we are trying to improve access not just mobility. This can be achieved in three different ways: with good transport systems, with good spatial planning, or by improving digital access. We need to integrate our thinking across these three areas to achieve the optimal outcome. 2. 	To reduce the uncertainty we face we should seek to better understand the factors affecting the changing patterns of demand and refresh our demand models accordingly. We should look both at social trends and also speed in development, take-up and impact of new technologies. 3. 	To ensure resilience of the access system we develop for New Zealand we should seek to build in flexibility where we can. This will allow us to respond more quickly to changing patterns of demand and reduce the likelihood we will make investments which will become unnecessary. 4. 	We need to recognise the investment decisions we make will shape patterns of demand and not just respond to them. We should move away from the approach of seeking to simply predict future demand and then provide for it. We should instead debate the sort of access we want and decide how to invest to support the future...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{conjecture}} is that <b>revenue</b> <b>assurance</b> is {{a response}} to changing market conditions. The thinking is that as markets reach saturation and growth potential falls off, so the value of maximizing returns from existing sales increases. This observation has some merit but does not explain the increasing popularity of <b>revenue</b> <b>assurance</b> in telcos serving growth markets. It also in part contradicts the assumption of a compelling costs versus benefits argument for <b>revenue</b> <b>assurance,</b> which would be enhanced in businesses undergoing rapid change. It is also important to recognize that there is a long history of <b>revenue</b> <b>assurance</b> activities in some telcos that predates the coining of the term [...] "revenue assurance".|$|E
50|$|The <b>revenue</b> <b>assurance</b> {{techniques}} {{applied in}} practice cover a broad spectrum, from analysis {{and implementation of}} business controls to automated data interrogation. At {{one end of the}} spectrum, <b>revenue</b> <b>assurance</b> can appear very similar to the kinds of review and process mapping techniques applied for other financial controlling objectives like accounting integrity, as exemplified by those derived from clause 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This form of <b>revenue</b> <b>assurance</b> is most commonly promoted by consultancies. The size of such consultancies covers the entire range; the Big 4 all offer some form of <b>revenue</b> <b>assurance</b> consulting, but there are also niche specialist consultancies. At {{the other end of the}} spectrum, <b>revenue</b> <b>assurance</b> is treated as a form of reactive automated data interrogation, seeking to find anomalies in transaction data that may indicate errors and potential revenue loss. This form of <b>revenue</b> <b>assurance</b> is most commonly promoted by software houses that aim to provide databases and configurable tools to extract and interrogate a telco's source data. A less popular form of reactive automated assurance involves using both software and specialised hardware as a means of extracting additional data on transactions, for example by creating actual network events or interfacing directly with network elements to replicate dummy events. As with consultancies, IT-oriented <b>revenue</b> <b>assurance</b> solutions are offered by both large vendors like providers of billing and mediation software, and by specialized niche providers.|$|E
5000|$|Defined: At {{this level}} {{that there are}} sets of defined and {{documented}} standard <b>Revenue</b> <b>Assurance</b> processes established and subject to some degree of improvement over time. These standard processes are in place (i.e., they are the AS-IS processes) and used to establish consistency of process performance across the organization. There are specific tools for <b>Revenue</b> <b>Assurance</b> identified and implemented. There is clear sense of what revenue chain coverage does, what the <b>Revenue</b> <b>Assurance</b> department cover and road maps are {{in place for the}} future. All major revenue streams are covered by now. There is a formalized and approved <b>Revenue</b> <b>Assurance</b> charter and strategy in place.

5000|$|As yet, {{there is}} no {{professional}} body, no qualifications, and no academic research that would help to drive consensus about the purpose or methods of <b>revenue</b> <b>assurance.</b> In part this is addressed by individuals working in the sector through membership and qualification in related fields such as accountancy and information systems audit. Some scientific research in other fields is also applicable to <b>revenue</b> <b>assurance,</b> though most <b>revenue</b> <b>assurance</b> [...] "facts" [...] rely heavily on anecdotes and oft-repeated truisms.

50|$|<b>Revenue</b> <b>Assurance</b> {{has been}} a problem for the telecom {{companies}} since the very early stages. Tracking of pulses, minutes, counts, bytes etc. has never been more difficult. One would think these would be easy for the tech-savvy telco companies. However, the truth has been just the opposite. In a hurry to release new technologies in the market, the <b>Revenue</b> <b>Assurance</b> systems are always lagging behind. <b>Revenue</b> <b>Assurance</b> in a telco environment covers a wide range of technical and business aspects. An RA operator needs to be aware of both OSS & BSS processes and internal dependencies to accurately decipher the revenue code.|$|E
