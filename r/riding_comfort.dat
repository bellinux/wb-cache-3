40|$|Vehicle {{vibration}} mostly originates {{from the}} road excitation and causes discomfort, fatigue and even injury to a driver. Vehicle <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> {{is one of the}} most important performance indices to achieve a high-quality vehicle design. Since design parameter tolerances inevitably result in the vehicle <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> variance, the variance characteristics should be analyzed in the early design stage of the vehicle. The vehicle <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> is often defined by an index whichemploys a weighted RMS value of the acceleration PSD of a seat position. The design solution is obtained through two steps in this study. An optimization problem to obtain a minimum <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> index is solved first. Then another optimization problem to obtain minimum variance of the <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> index is solved. For the optimization problems, the equations of motion and the sensitivity equations are derived basing on a 5 -DOF vehicle model.

40|$|<b>Ride</b> <b>comfort</b> of road {{vehicles}} {{running on the}} ground has been extensively investigated {{as one of the}} main criteria in the design of {{road vehicles}}. The information on the <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> of road vehicles running on a long span cable-supported bridge under crosswind is, however, very limited. This paper presents an evaluation of <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> of road vehicles running on a long span cable-stayed bridge under crosswind. The <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> criteria for road vehicles are briefly reviewed first. The principle of mathematical modeling and the equation of motion of a coupled road vehicle-bridge system under crosswind are then introduced. The framework proposed is finally applied to a group of high-sided road vehicles running on a real cable-stayed bridge under crosswind as a case study. <b>Ride</b> <b>comfort</b> of the high-sided road vehicle under various conditions of road roughness, vehicle speed, and crosswind speed is investigated for the vehicle running on either the ground or the cable-stayed bridge with and without crosswind. The results show that the crosswind influences the <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> of the vehicle in the lateral direction while the bridge motion affects the <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> of the vehicle in the vertical direction.

40|$|When {{designing}} {{vehicle suspension}} systems, it is well-known that spring and damper characteristics required for good handling on a vehicle {{are not the}} same as those required for good <b>ride</b> <b>comfort.</b> Any choice of spring and damper characteristic is therefore necessarily a compromise between <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> and handling. The compromise is more pronounced on off-road vehicles, as they require good <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> over rough off-road terrain, as well as acceptable on-road handling. In this paper, the <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> vs. handling compromise for off-road vehicles is investigated by means of three case studies. All three case studies indicate that the spring and damper charcteristics required for <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> and handling lie on opposite extremes of the design space. Design criteria for a semi-active suspension system, that could significantly reduce, or even eliminate the <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> vs. handling compromise, are proposed. The system should be capable of switching safely and predictably between a stiff spring and high damping mode (for handling) as well as a soft spring and low damping mode (for <b>ride</b> <b>comfort).</b> A possible solution to the compromise, in the form of a four state, semi-active hydropneumatic spring-damper system, is proposed.

40|$|This paper investigates passive vehicle {{suspensions}} with inerters {{by considering}} multiple performance requirements including <b>ride</b> <b>comfort,</b> suspension deflection and tyre grip, where suspension deflection performance is novelly considered which is formulated {{as a part}} of objective functions and a constraint separately. Six suspension configurations are analyzed and the analytical solutions for each performance measure are derived. The conditions for each configuration to be strictly better than the simpler ones are obtained by presenting the analytical solutions of each configuration based on those of the simpler ones. Then, two stages of comparisons are given to show the performance limitations of suspension deflection for passive suspensions with inerters. In the first stage, it is shown that although the configurations with inerters can improve the mixed performance of <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> and tyre grip, the suspension deflection performance is significantly decreased simultaneously. In the second stage, it is shown that for passive suspensions with inerters, suspension deflection is the more basic limitation for both <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> and tyre grip performance by doing comparisons among mixed <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> and suspension deflection optimization, mixed <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> and tyre grip optimization, and mixed suspension deflection and tyre grip optimization.

Three controllers, including skyhook damper control, slide model control (SMC) and fuzzy logical control (FLC), are applied to the semi-active/active suspension with passive seat suspension. To improve the <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> further, combination the best performance of <b>ride</b> <b>comfort</b> from active chassis suspension, the semi-active seat suspension is then designed.
