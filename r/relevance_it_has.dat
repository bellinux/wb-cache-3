Although numerous imprinted genes have been described in several lineages, the phenomenon of genomic imprinting presents a peculiar evolutionary problem. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain gene imprinting, the most supported being Haig’s kinship theory. This theory explains the observed pattern of imprinting and the resulting phenotypes as a competition for resources between related individuals, but despite its <b>relevance</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> not been independently tested. Haig’s theory predicts that gene imprinting should be present in eusocial insects in many social scenarios.

For a Hopf operad P, the construction is based on the operad P [n] obtained from P by adjoining a free n-ary operation. The dierence with respect to [12] is that we also prove that the operad P [n] is under suitable restrictions a Hopf operad. This presentation simplies some proofs and assures that relevant unctorial properties come for free.

I propose a specification for being a digital state in a digital system, especially a digital computational system.

Rep-resentations are typically invoked in a ‘computational theory of the mind’, where mental processes are understood as information processing through computational operations over representations. The standard theory is the computational representational theory of mind (CRM or “computationalism”), which says that the human mind is a functional computational mechanism operating over representa-tions. These representational abilities are then to be explained naturalistically, either as a result of in...|$|E

For models where the two fluids co-rotate in the unperturbed state, our analysis clarifies the role of chemical coupling and entrainment for sound and inertial waves. We also investigate the mutual friction damping, providing results that demonstrate the well-known fact that sound waves propagating along a vortex array are undamped. We show that the same is not true for inertial waves, which are damped by the mutual friction regardless of the propagation direction. We then include the vortex tension, which arises due to local vortex curvature. Focussing on purely transverse inertial waves, we derive the small correction that the tension induces in the wave frequency. Finally, we allow for a relative linear flow in the background (along the rotation axis). In this case we show how the mutual friction coupling may induce a dynamical instability in the inertial waves. We discuss the critical flow required for the instability to be present, its physical interpretation and the possible <b>relevance</b> <b>it</b> may <b>have</b> for neutron star physics.

Many of the same issues and methods apply directly to AI systems, including the need to identify clearly one's dependent and independent variables, the importance of careful experimental design, and the need to average across random variables outside one's control.
