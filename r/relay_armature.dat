5000|$|Comparing. Simple {{comparing}} circuits had two entries and one exit that emitted a pulse whenever pulses {{arrived at the}} entries at different times. Some machines, e.g. collators, could detect which number was higher {{if they were not}} equal. A tabulating machine might compare the account number on successive cards and print a total when a new account number appeared. For the compare function, IBM implemented what would now be called an XOR gate using opposing electromagnets. If neither magnet was energized or both magnets were energized at the same time, the <b>relay</b> <b>armature</b> would not move. If only one magnet was energized, the armature would move and touch one of two contacts placed on either side. The two contacts were wired together internally and connected to an exit hub that indicated an unequal comparison.|$|E
5000|$|Each mine {{contained}} a {{dry cell battery}} with an electrical detonating circuit which could be initiated by any one of five parallel fuzes. Four of the fuzes were conventional horns in the buoyant upper hemisphere of the mine. Each horn {{contained a}} glass ampule of electrolyte which would connect an open circuit if an ampule was broken by bending the soft metal horn. [...] The novel fifth fuze was a copper wire antenna with a float to extend it above the mine. A ship's steel hull touching the copper antenna would form a battery, and seawater acted as an electrolyte completing a circuit with an insulated copper plate on the mine surface to actuate a detonating relay within the mine. [...] The <b>relay</b> <b>armature</b> was initially set to complete the detonating circuit at 25 to 40 millivolts. The Bureau of Ordnance subsequently increased sensitivity to 10 to 25 millivolts, but this was later readjusted {{on the basis of}} field experience. [...] Each mine had five separate spring-loaded safety switches in the detonating circuit held open by salt pellets which took about 20 minutes to dissolve in sea water after the mine was dropped overboard from the minelayer. [...] Battery life for the detonating circuit was estimated at greater than two years.|$|E
50|$|Three to {{five percent}} of the new mines dropped into the North Sea detonated as soon as the salt pellets dissolved; and hydrophones {{detected}} premature detonations continuing for a week after minelaying. These premature detonations were initially attributed to activation of the horn fuze detonation circuits by seawater leaking into the mines; and mine spacing was increased from 250 ft on the first minelaying excursion to 300 ft on subsequent excursions to minimize leakage caused by detonation of nearby mines. About one percent of the mines deployed during the first excursion broke free of their mooring cables and washed ashore in Norway within a month. Mines used for the last eleven excursions had springs installed at the mine mooring cable attachment points to buffer wave loading during storms. Premature detonations increased to 14 percent for the fourth minelaying excursion; because some mines had been assembled with the more sensitive antenna fuze relay settings made by the Bureau of Ordnance. The fifth minelaying excursion was halted when 19 percent of the mines detonated prematurely. San Francisco identified <b>relay</b> <b>armature</b> sensitivity as a major cause of premature detonations during a comparative field test minelaying excursion on August 12. Subsequent investigations revealed copper sulfate deposits caused by antenna corrosion created a weak battery increasing the probability of relay activation by shock wave accelerations when nearby mines detonated. Premature detonations dropped to four to six percent when sensitivity was adjusted to 30 to 45 millivolts for mines deployed by the last five minelaying excursions.|$|E

50|$|A {{polarized}} <b>relay</b> {{places the}} <b>armature</b> between the poles {{of a permanent}} magnet to increase sensitivity. Polarized relays were used in middle 20th Century telephone exchanges to detect faint pulses and correct telegraphic distortion. The poles were on screws, so a technician could first adjust them for maximum sensitivity and then apply a bias spring to set the critical current that would operate the relay.|$|R
5000|$|Common {{difficulties}} with the sweeping procedure involved mine cables becoming {{entangled in the}} kites attached to the sweeping wires. Sweeping gear was often lost if the mine detonated and cut the sweeping cables. Approximately {{one third of the}} ships were damaged by exploding mines. Two men were killed in separate incidents while attempting to haul mines aboard to clear fouled sweeping kites. It had been assumed the Mk 6 mine hydrostatic safety devices would minimize the risks of this procedure, but sweeping gear losses increased after unreliability of these safety devices was recognized. Countermining sequences initiated by destruction of a swept mine causing detonation of an undetected mine closer to one of the minesweepers were another source of damage. Some of this countermining was attributed to acceleration of the antenna fuze <b>relay</b> <b>armature</b> or seawater leaking into damaged mines rather than sympathetic detonation of explosives. The minesweepers were sometimes able to continue sweeping, but the trawlers were less durable. Seven men drowned when the Richard Bulkeley was sunk by a mine detonation on 12 July. Strauss discontinued use of the trawlers for minesweeping, but retained six for transporting replacement sweeping gear to minesweepers when wires were destroyed by exploding mines. The remaining 13 trawlers were returned to the Admiralty. Most damaged ships were repaired, but SC-38 was declared a total loss. Three more men of the minesweeping force were killed in individual accidents involving sweeping gear before Strauss declared the barrage cleared on 30 September 1919. [...] The minesweepers found only about 25 to 30 percent of the mines laid a year earlier; but it was assumed the others had either broken free, sunk to the bottom, or been destroyed by premature explosions. Strauss was recognized as a Knight Commander of St Michael and St George for his efforts; but doubts about effectiveness of the minesweeping effort persisted into the 21st century.|$|E

It is propelled by a conventional, gasoline-fueled, heat-engine-driven alternator and a traction pack powering a series-wound, 10 hp direct-current electric drive motor. The 16 hp gasoline engine drives the 7 kilowatt alternator, which provides electrical power to the drive motor or to the 96 volt traction battery through a rectifier. The propulsion battery consists of eight 12 volt batteries connected in series. The electric motor is coupled to a four-speed standard transmission, which drives the rear wheels.

50|$|A simple {{electromagnetic}} relay {{consists of a}} coil of wire wrapped around a soft iron core (a solenoid), an iron yoke which provides a low reluctance path for magnetic flux, a movable iron armature, and one or more sets of contacts (there are two contacts in the <b>relay</b> pictured). The <b>armature</b> is hinged to the yoke and mechanically linked {{to one or more}} sets of moving contacts. The armature is held in place by a spring so that when the relay is de-energized there is an air gap in the magnetic circuit. In this condition, one of the two sets of contacts in the relay pictured is closed, and the other set is open. Other relays may have more or fewer sets of contacts depending on their function. The relay in the picture also has a wire connecting the armature to the yoke. This ensures continuity of the circuit between the moving contacts on the armature, and the circuit track on the printed circuit board (PCB) via the yoke, which is soldered to the PCB.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{scientific}} paper {{focuses on}} {{development of a}} method for mechanical parameters control of the neutral relay of rail automatics by current analyzing in the coil and the relay contacts at switching based on wavelet transform. Methodology. The methodology was based on current analysis of the relay coil and contacts currents under its switching and analysis obtained results by using wavelet transform. Findings. The time dependences of the current in coil and in contacts under switching {{on and off for}} the operable relays and relays with certain defects have been measured at different voltages applied to coil (10, 12 и 14 V). When voltage applied to coil was increased the rate of coil current increased, but time constant of the circuit was changed with voltage slightly. The current value maximum at which the <b>relay</b> <b>armature</b> begun to move for the operable relays was depended on applied voltage slightly. For the time interval, at which armature was putted to the relay core fully, time constant of the circuit was changed with voltage slightly also. The maximum current value at which the armature starts to move to the relay serviceable little dependent on the applied voltage. For site based in which the anchor is completely dragged constant current rise time is also a little dependent on the applied voltage. Similar results were obtained for the current reduction time constant with turning off the voltage and current confinement. The current pick-up and the current release of the armature increases for the relay with the load anchor is proportional to the weight of cargo, {{as well as for the}} relay contact with the rear, bent down, while the flexural rear contact up these currents have smaller values. Large-scale (low-frequency) coefficients of DWT can be used for a more accurate comparison of the current pick-up, and release time constants of the transient. Small scale coefficients fiberboard (HF) can be used as distinguishing traits defects mobile relay system. Originality. For the first time, on the basis of the research proposed to use detailing coefficients of a discrete wavelet transform as a symptom of mobile relay system. The approximation (smoothing) ratios can be used for a more accurate comparison of the current pick-up, and release time constants of the transient to detect defects of the electromagnetic relay system.
