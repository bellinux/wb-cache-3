40|$|The Brazilian {{reservoirs}} {{have been}} under great anthropogenic pressure due to continued population growth, which in turn places great pressures on the environment. Given this issue, this study aimed to analyze the influence of land use on the quality and genotoxicity {{of water in the}} Itupararanga reservoir, São Paulo, Brazil. Water and sediment samples were analyzed for their quality, genotoxicity and benthic diversity, as well as their interrelationship with the landscape. The reservoir was found to be eutrophic in most sampling stations, and genetic al terations were found in <b>radicular</b> <b>cells</b> of exposed Allium cepa in some sampling stations, besides a low diversity of benthic organisms. Among the variables that most contributed to the genetic alterations and water quality are the presence of riparian vegetation, the bare soil and urban occupation. With the results obtained in this study it was concluded that the quality of water and sediment at the Itupararanga reservoir is compromised, requiring emergency managements to ensure the sustainability of water resources...|$|E
40|$|During {{germination}} of the â€˜seedâ€™ of Balanophora, endosperm <b>cells</b> at the <b>radicular</b> pole {{grow out}} as tubular structures and anchor the â€˜seedâ€™ {{to the host}} rootlet. The <b>radicular</b> tier of <b>cells</b> of the embryo elongate as primary haustorial tubes and establish contact with the host root vasculature. A secondary haustorium arises from a meristem adjoining the primary haustorium. The remainder of the embryo contributes to the tuber proper. Host parenchyma {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the primary haustorium reverts to meristematic activity. Some of the derivatives mature as perforate tracheary cells. The remainder, retaining meristematic activity, squeeze themselves between secondary haustorial cells and together initiate a composite conducting strand, which repeatedly dichotomizes as the tuber grows. The conducting strand of Balanophora is looked upon as the equivalent of combined adventitious root system of parasite and host. The remaining part of the tuber is equivalent to the shoot...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To assess {{vascular}} endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) expression and microvessel density (MVD) by immunohistochemistry and to relate {{them to the}} inflammatory status {{in a sample of}} radicular cysts. METHODS: Specimens of 24 human radicular cysts were examined by immunohistochemistry using antibodies anti-VEGF and anti-CD 34 and to evaluate vascular density. Integrity of the epithelium and inflammatory state of the connective tissues were evaluated and related with the immunohistochemical findings. A Spearman correlation test was utilized to compare the means of each parameter. RESULTS: VEGF immunoreactivity was detected in both epithelial and connective tissues of <b>radicular</b> cysts. Stromal <b>cells</b> showed higher levels of VEGF expression when compared to epithelial cells. MVD proved to be related to VEGF expression levels (P < or = 0. 01). In addition, increased MVD was associated with high levels of inflammation (P < or = 0. 01). Most of the specimens showed a massive inflammatory infiltrate in the connective tissue. The integrity of the cystic lining tend to decrease with increased inflammation...|$|R
