In fact, private and public authorities and several stakeholders are involved, and all of them should participate actively in the decision making process. To ensure the sustainability of these sites, it is important to evaluate several parameters and to design an integrated plan.

40|$|AbstractSustainable development, {{perceived}} as a main trend in the entrepreneurial field, has become a concept with extended applicability in the daily activities of economic entities. Although, initially, the concept has been only theoretically tackled, nowadays the necessity of putting it into practice is fully recognized and understood. The values of the Romanian rural environment, very little known and recognized at international level, are fundamental cornerstones for the exploitation of socio-economic development opportunities which are very much needed by the Romanian rural environment. The present paper aims to undertake a study that will analyze the advantages of international cooperation in the maintenance and valorisation of <b>rural</b> touristic <b>heritage.</b> The study starts from {{the premise that the}} <b>rural</b> touristic <b>heritage</b> sustains the socio-economic and cultural development at regional and national level. In compliance with the requirements of sustainable development, we believe that it is a duty to pass on the touristic heritage to the future generations in an improved state which is beneficial for the socio-economic progress. The study is concluded on the following stages: the presentation of rural touristic values from the North-East Development Region, the highlight of actions supported so far for the reconstruction of rural environment, the identification of the most efficient ways of international cooperation for the valorisation of touristic identity of the rural environment as well as a set of proposals of the regional rural tourism through valorisation mechanisms of the available touristic heritage...|$|R
