25|$|Professor Nathaniel Kleitman and {{his student}} Eugene Aserinsky defined <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> and linked it to dreams in 1953 and further {{described}} by researchers including William Dement and Michel Jouvet. Many experiments have involved awakening test subjects whenever {{they begin to}} enter the REM phase, thereby producing a state known as REM deprivation. Subjects allowed to sleep normally again usually experience a modest REM rebound. Techniques of neurosurgery, chemical injection, electroencephalography, positron emission tomography, and reports of dreamers upon waking, have all been used to study this phase of sleep.|$|E
25|$|Memory {{processes}} {{have been}} shown to be stabilized and enhanced (sped up and/or integrated) and memories better consolidated by nocturnal sleep and even daytime naps. Certain sleep stages have been demonstrated as improving an individual's memory, though this is task-specific. Generally, declarative memories are believed to be enhanced by slow-wave sleep, while non-declarative memories are enhanced by <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> (REM) sleep, although there are some inconsistencies among experimental results. The effect of sleep on memory, especially as it pertains to the human brain, is an active field of research in neurology, psychology, and related disciplines.|$|E
25|$|Accumulated {{observation}} {{has shown}} that dreams are strongly associated with REM <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep, during which an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows brain activity that, among sleep states, is most like wakefulness. Participant-remembered dreams during NREM sleep are normally more mundane in comparison. During a typical lifespan, a person spends {{a total of about}} six years dreaming (which is about two hours each night). Most dreams only last 5 to 20 minutes. It is unknown where in the brain dreams originate, if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple portions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body or mind.|$|E

Detailed electrophysiological studies revealed abnormalities of neurological pathways not apparent clinically. The patients had slow saccades as mesasured electrophysiologically, as well as absence of <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> (REM) despite REM stages of sleep. These studies suggest that although saccadic <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> and REM are mediated through the pontine paramedian reticular formation, other characteristics of REM sleep are not necessarily mediated through the same neurons...|$|R
40|$|Saccades are <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> {{that change}} the line of sight between {{successive}} points of fixation. Even as we attempt to fixate our gaze precisely, small <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> called microsaccades interrupt fixation one or two times each second. Although the neural pathway controlling saccade generation is well understood, the specific mechanism for triggering microsaccades is unknown. Here, we review the evidence suggesting that microsaccades and saccades are generated by the same neural pathway. We also discuss current models of how the saccadic system producesmicrosaccades. Finally, we propose a newmechanism for triggering bothmicrosaccades and saccades, based on a circuit formed by omnipause and long-lead burst neurons and driven by activity in the superior colliculus. Our model differs from previous proposals in {{that it does not}} require superior colliculus activity to surpass a particular threshold to triggermicrosaccades and saccades. Rather,wepropose that the reciprocal inhibitionbetweenomnipause and long-lead burst neurons gates each microsaccadic or saccadic event, triggering the <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> whenever the activity in the long-lead burst neurons overcomes the inhibition from the omnipause neurons...|$|R

For example, they often have difficulty moving their eyes in the desired direction. In other words, the saccades (<b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movements)</b> are abnormal.

25|$|The first semi-multiple-systematic {{study of}} the {{connection}} between sleep and memory was conducted in 1924 by Jenkins and Dallenbach, for the purpose of testing Hermann Ebbinghaus' memory decay theory. Their results showed that memory retention was much better after a period of sleep compared to the same time interval spent awake. It was not until 1953, however, when sleep was delineated into <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep and non-rapid eye movement sleep, that studies focusing on the effect of specific sleep stages on memory were conducted. As behavioral characteristics of the effects of sleep and memory are becoming increasingly understood and supported, researchers are turning to the weakly understood neural basis of sleep and memory.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people with}} {{narcolepsy}} also suffer from insomnia {{for extended periods}} of time. The excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy often become severe enough to cause serious problems in a person's social, personal, and professional life. Normally, when an individual is awake, brain waves show a regular rhythm. When a person first falls asleep, the brain waves become slower and less regular, which is called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. After {{about an hour and}} a half of NREM sleep, the brain waves begin to show a more active pattern again, called REM sleep (<b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep), when most remembered dreaming occurs. Associated with the EEG-observed waves during REM sleep, muscle atonia is present called REM atonia.|$|E
25|$|In narcolepsy, {{the order}} and length of NREM and REM sleep periods are disturbed, with REM sleep {{occurring}} at sleep onset instead of {{after a period of}} NREM sleep. Also, some aspects of REM sleep that normally occur only during sleep, like lack of muscular control, sleep paralysis, and vivid dreams, occur at other times in people with narcolepsy. For example, the lack of muscular control can occur during wakefulness in a cataplexy episode; it is said that there is intrusion of REM atonia during wakefulness. Sleep paralysis and vivid dreams can occur while falling asleep or waking up. Simply put, the brain does not pass through the normal stages of dozing and deep sleep but goes directly into (and out of) <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> (REM) sleep.|$|E

30|$|According to Velásquez (2013), <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> can {{be divided}} into two categories; {{fixation}} movement, which is characterized as when the observer kept the gaze fixed at the stimulation point and the saccade movement, which represents the movement performed from one fixation to another. In this context, Nielsen and Pernice (2009) define fixation as the moment when the eyes are still on an object and one can see it in detail, while saccade corresponds to the <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> between two fixations.|$|R
50|$|A recent {{research}} model proposes that {{the perception of}} space and time undergoes strong distortions during <b>rapid</b> saccadic <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b> The expectation of perceived motion is necessary for anticipatory slow <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> sleep (REM) {{has since}} its {{discovery}} been {{closely associated with}} dreaming. Waking up sleepers during a REM phase is a common experimental method for obtaining dream reports; 80% of neurotypical people can give some kind of dream report under these circumstances. Sleepers awakened from REM tend to give longer more narrative descriptions of the dreams they were experiencing, and to estimate the duration of their dreams as longer. Lucid dreams are reported far more often in REM sleep. (In fact these {{could be considered a}} hybrid state combining essential elements of REM sleep and waking consciousness.) The mental events which occur during REM most commonly have dream hallmarks including narrative structure, convincingness (experiential resemblance to waking life), and incorporation of instinctual themes. Sometimes they include elements of the dreamer's recent experience taken directly from episodic memory. By one estimate, 80% of dreams occur during REM.|$|E
25|$|REM {{sleep is}} known for its vivid creations and {{similarity}} to the bioelectric outputs of a waking person. This stage of sleep is characterized by muscle atonia, fast but low voltage EEG and, as the name suggests, <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement.</b> It is difficult to attribute memory gains to a single stage of sleep when it may be the entire sleep cycle that is responsible for memory consolidation. Recent research conducted by Datta et al. used an avoidance task followed by a post-training REM sleep period to examine changes in P waves affecting reprocessing of recently acquired stimuli. It was found that not only were the P waves increased during post-training sleep but also the density of the waves. These findings may imply that P waves during REM sleep may help to activate critical forebrain and cortical structures dealing with memory consolidation. In a Hennevin et al. study, 1989, the mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF) was given light electrical stimulation, during REM sleep, which is known to have an advantageous effect for learning when applied after training. The rats in the experiment were trained to run a maze in search of a food reward. One group of rats was given non-awakening MRF electrical stimulations after each of their maze trials compared to a control group which did not receive any electrical stimulation. It was noticed that the stimulated rats performed significantly better in respect to error reduction. These findings imply that dynamic memory processes occur both during training as well as during post-training sleep. Another study by Hennevin et al. (1998) conditioned rats to fear a noise that is associated with a subsequent foot shock. The interesting part of the experiment is that fear responding to the noise (measured in the amygdala) was observed when the noise was presented during REM sleep. This was compared to a group of pseudo-conditioned rats who did not display the same amygdalar activation during post-training sleep. This would suggest that neural responding to previously salient stimuli is maintained even during REM sleep. There is no shortage of research conducted on the effects that REM sleep has on the working brain but consistency in the findings is what plagues recent research. There is no guarantee as to what functions REM sleep may perform for our bodies and brains but modern research is always expanding and assimilating new ideas to further our understanding of such processes.|$|E
