50|$|The Super-Sonic has two humbuckers. These pickups were {{produced}} in South Korea, and had wooden spacers, and ceramic magnets. The guitar had no tone control, but instead utilized two <b>volume</b> <b>controls</b> with pickup switching {{controlled by a}} 3-way toggle switch. The <b>volume</b> <b>controls</b> were wired reverse, with the <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> closest to the bridge controlling the bridge pickup, and the <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> closest to the input jack working the rhythm pickup.|$|R

5000|$|Smart <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> for mobile phones: The <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> {{in mobile}} phones {{depend on the}} {{background}} noise levels, noise classes, hearing profile of the user and other parameters.

The authors have demonstrated the successful use of fuzzy logic system for <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> in mobile handsets.|$|R
50|$|Because the <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> in non-A.V.C. {{receivers}} adjusts R.F. signal levels {{rather than}} A.F. signal levels, the <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> must be manipulated while tuning {{the radio in}} order to find weak signals.|$|R
50|$|Blend potentiometers are {{a popular}} {{modification}} to instruments with separate <b>volume</b> <b>controls</b> for pickups, no master volume and/or no pickup selector. For instance, on the Fender Jazz Bass, the dual <b>volume</b> <b>controls</b> {{can be replaced}} with blend and master <b>volume</b> <b>controls,</b> to allow the instrument's output level to be adjusted with just one knob while still retaining the various {{combinations of the two}} pickups blended together.|$|R
50|$|Other {{controls}} with {{a maximum}} of 11 include SSL mixing consoles, the BBC's iPlayer on demand video player, the headphone <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> on the PreSonus AudioBox 1818VSL, the <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> on the Apogee Mini-DAC, the IRIX audio panel (when invoked with the undocumented -spinaltap option), and the Tesla Model S's <b>volume</b> <b>control.</b> The tachometer on a Singer Vehicle Design modified Porsche 911 goes up to 11, representing 11,000 RPM.|$|R

25|$|A {{variety of}} labels {{are used for}} level {{attenuation}} potentiometers (knobs) in a guitar amplifier and other guitar equipment. Electric guitars and basses have a <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> on the instrument that attenuates the signal from selected pickups. There may be two <b>volume</b> <b>controls</b> on an electric guitar or bass, wired in parallel to mix the signal levels from the neck and bridge pickups. Rolling back the guitar's <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> also changes the pickup's equalization or frequency response, which can provide pre-distortion equalization.|$|R
50|$|Separate <b>volume</b> <b>controls</b> {{are usually}} {{installed}} in each room or zone {{to compensate for}} differences in apparent volume due to room size and shape. Here especially, impedance-matching <b>volume</b> <b>controls</b> {{can be used to}} protect the amplifier from overload. This system design is otherwise the same as a single source, single zone in that all zones must listen to the same audio source, though <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> is independent in each room (and audio can be turned off in rooms, as desired).|$|R
40|$|Hemorrhagic shock {{causes a}} {{reduction}} in oxygen supply to tissues leading to increased reactive oxygen species resulting in lung injury. Often mechanical ventilation is required as supportive treatment; however, ventilation can also induce lung injury and apoptosis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effects of three modes of <b>controlled</b> mechanical ventilation: <b>volume</b> <b>control,</b> pressure control, and pressure regulated <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> on lung injury as measured by hydrogen peroxide and apoptosis during hemorrhagic shock. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to the three controlled mechanical ventilation groups. Hemorrhagic shock was elicited by removing approximately 40 % of the blood volume over 30 minutes. The rats were treated with one of three modes of mechanical ventilation with 40 % oxygen for 60 minutes. The lungs were removed and measured for hydrogen peroxide and apoptosis based on nuclear differential dye uptake. There were no significant differences in hemodynamics, arterial blood values, peak inspiratory pressures, tidal volume, respiratory rates, and intrathoracic pressures across three groups. However, lung hydrogen peroxide production and apoptosis were significantly increased in <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> and pressure control, compared to pressure-regulated <b>volume</b> <b>control.</b> In this study, early signs of ventilator induced lung injury were not detected using commonly employed clinical measurements. However, when examining lung cellular injury (hydrogen peroxide and apoptosis), we were able to measure significant lung damage in <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> and pressure control, but not pressure-regulated <b>volume</b> <b>control.</b> Thus, our results suggest that pressure-regulated <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> is the preferable mode of mechanical ventilation during hemorrhagic shock. </b...|$|R
