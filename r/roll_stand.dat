40|$|Cold {{pilgering}} is a {{cold forming}} process used during manufacturing of seamless tubes. The tube with a mandrel inside is fed forward and rotated in stepwise increments, while the <b>roll</b> <b>stand</b> moves back and forth. The total plastic deformation of the tube is such that the cross-sectional area of the tube decreases {{and the length of}} the tube increases during the process. However, this is performed in many small incremental steps, where the direction of deformation in a material point changes at each stroke. Most published models of cold pilgering use simplified material models. In reality, the flow stress is dependent on temperature, strain rate, strain history and microstructure. In this work, temperature and strain rate distributions are computed, using a 3 D thermo-mechanical FE model, and the influence of temperature and strain rate on the rolling force is investigated. The Johnson-Cook model is employed to describe the flow stress using isotropic hardening. The results show that strain rate and temperature havea significant influence on the roll separation force...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: 3 D-Strip Profile Rolling should {{enable the}} {{production}} of blanks with a defined thickness profile in latitudinal and longitudinal direction. The production chain of 3 D-Strip Profile Rolling will combine Flexible Rolling in a first production step with Strip Profile Rolling in a second step. The control system to adjust the roll gap during 3 D-Strip Profile Rolling is currently under development. Nevertheless, some first experiments have shown the general feasibility to produce 3 D-profiled blanks. In 3 D-Strip Profile Rolling the material will strain harden differently on different locations. This results in {{a variation of the}} material properties of the strip. Lateral spread, elastic <b>roll</b> <b>stand</b> deformation and local deformation will be influenced by this variation. To investigate these influences on the complete production process, the complete production chain needs to be modelled in the future with aid of finite element simulations.

To maintain a constant high product quality, a new roll former with an adjustable final roll forming stand is developed at Deakin University enabling the continuous compensation for possible shape defects. In this work, a numerical approach to robust in-line control of the roll forming of a V-section profile is presented, combining the aspects of robust process design and in-line compensation methods. A numerical study is performed to determine the relationship between controllable process settings and uncontrollable variation of incoming material properties with respect to the common product defects longitudinal bow and springback. The computationally expensive non-linear FE simulations used in this study are subsequently replaced by metamod-els based on efficient Single Response Surfaces. Using these metamodels, the optimal setting for the adjustable stand is determined with robust optimization techniques and the effect on product quality analyzed.

40|$|The {{quality of}} roll formed {{products}} {{is known to}} be highly dependent on the process design. In addition, unavoidable variations of material properties during mass production can have a significant deteriorating effect on the product quality. This study focuses on the question how to compensate for product defects while simultaneously minimizing the sensitivity for variation of material properties. This is achieved by using robust optimization techniques to determine the optimal process settings of adjustable tools in the final roll forming stand. The work covers both numerical analyses as well as experiments. Initial roll forming experiments of an Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) V-section profile showed a significant amount of longitudinal bow and springback in the final product. Finite Element (FE) simulations are subsequently performed to determine the relationship between adjustable process settings and uncontrollable variation of incoming material properties with respect to the product defects. The computationally expensive non-linear FE simulations are subsequently replaced by the best performing metamodel chosen from of a family of metamodels. Using these metamodels, the optimal robust process settings for the adjustable stand are determined and the effect on product quality analyzed. The results show that the effect of scattering material properties on the dimensional quality of the roll formed product is significant. Moreover, it is shown that the adjustment of the tooling in the final <b>roll</b> <b>stand</b> leads to a significantly improved product quality by compensating for product defects and minimizing the deteriorating effects of scattering variables...|$|E

Consumers are focused on adding fiber and whole grains to be healthy and want the benefits of whole grain with the taste and appearance of refined flour. A review of current commercial whole wheat flour in the marketplace indicated many options for food processors to use. However, many of these options required processing changes and added ingredients to provide the consumer with a quality product. A milling and baking study was done to compare commercially and experimentally milled whole wheat flours from both white and red wheat varieties. Both white and red wheat varieties were kept identity preserved. Experimental milling was done with a hammer mill and a <b>roll</b> <b>stand</b> to closely replicate the commercial milling process. Baking was done using a sponge and dough method to closely replicate commercial baking conditions. The results showed both particle size and wheat variety impact bake performance of whole wheat flour. The most significant impact appeared to be dependent on the variety of wheat being milled. The milling process also had an impact. As particle size decreased, bake functionality improved. However, some decreased functionality was seen when particle size became very fine. It was concluded that additional work on a commercial flour mill needed to be done to determine if an optimal particle size for milling whole wheat flour exists. Experimental milling equipment was not adequate enough to replicate particle size distributions of commercial whole wheat mills...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{gains in}} wheat flour milling yield through conventional breeding strategies and milling technologies, the theoretical maximum yield {{still has not}} been attained. Discovery of genes in wheat that control flour yield would provide a means for breeders to develop new wheats that fulfill their potential in relation to this trait. A more targeted approach {{is to improve the}} understanding of the role of grain microstructure in determining high flour yield. Previous research has shown that increased flour yield in hard wheat is associated with increased endosperm rheology index, calculated from strength and stiffness as measured by the SKCS (Osborne et al, 2005; Osborne et al, 2007). Edwards et al (2007) demonstrated, through microscopy and particle size analysis of the crushed material from the SKCS 4100 and a first break <b>roll</b> <b>stand,</b> that the SKCS data for unconditioned wheat averaged over 300 grains provided a useful indicator of milling performance of a wheat sample. The Pina-D 1 and Pinb-D 1 alleles, tightly linked to the Ha locus on the short arm of Chromosome 5 D, determine the hardness phenotype (Greenwell and Schofield, 1986). However, this does not fully account for the observed genetic variation in hardness, especially within each hardness class, and it is thought that additional modifying genes account for the range of hardness within hard or soft classes (Martin et al, 2001). Others have investigated the relationship between endosperm starch granule size and hardness. Igrejas et al (2002) reported that harder wheat had a higher content of small starch granules but could not find a QTL for starch granule size on the 5 D Chromosome; they concluded that “starch size distribution is influenced by genes which have yet to be analysed”. The aim {{of the present study was}} to test the hypothesis that a genetic association exists in hard wheat between starch granule type and flour yield...|$|E

40|$|The initial {{process design}} of a roll forming system is often based on the {{traditional}} ‘flower pattern diagram’. In this diagram, the cross sections of the strip at each <b>roll</b> <b>stand</b> are superimposed on a single plane; the diagram is a 2 D representation of the 3 D process. In the present work, the flower pattern is extended into three dimensions. To demonstrate the method, the forming path or trajectory of a point {{at the edge of}} the strip during forming a V-section is considered. The forming path is a surface curve that lies on a cylindrical surface having its axis along the machine axis. This surface is unwrapped to give its plane development and important features of the forming process can be determined and are readily interpreted from this plane curve. It is shown that at any stage in the process, the axial strain and the curvature of the sheet adjacent to the point are dependent on the slope of the trajectory in this plane projection. This new diagram, which apparently has not been used previously, provides a useful initial method of examining the roll forming process and optimising the flower pattern. The model is purely geometric, as is the original flower pattern approach, and does not include the effect of material behaviour. The concept is applied to several cases available in the literature. It shows that the lowest level of shape defect in the part is achieved when the trajectory of the strip edge follows the shortest line length between the start and finish of forming, leading to the least longitudinal strain introduced in the flange. This trend is in agreement with previous experimental observations, suggesting that the analytical model proposed may be applied for early process design and optimisation before time-consuming numerical analysis is performed...|$|E

The objective of this research was to develop and analyze a sorghum tisane using two different red sorghum hybrids. Tisanes are herbal infusions composed of anything other than the leaves from the Camellia sinensis plant. The sorghum kernel was cracked using an Allis experimental <b>roll</b> <b>stand</b> equipped with a Le Page cut mill. Samples were sifted at 180 RMP- 4 ” diameter throw for 2 min. The two hybrids were roasted in a Whirlpool convection oven at 212 °C for 13 or 15 min. Three fruit and herbal combinations were tested to increase consumer acceptability. Samples was brewed for 4 min in 8 fl. oz at 100 °C. Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity(ORAC) and Total Phenolic Content (TPC) were used to analyze the beverage along with chemical, physical and sensory tests. TPC results showed sorghum tisane to have 38. 5 ± 6. 91 mg gallic acid equivalence/ 8 fl oz. and 433. 7 ± 7. 11 μM Trolox equivalence/ 236. 6 mL (8 fl. oz, 1 cup) for an ORAC value. Fruit and herbal combinations were also added to the sorghum to increase overall consumer acceptability. These combinations included strawberry mixed with lemon, blood orange mixed with pear, and pineapple mixed with orange. A consumer acceptance test was performed on the three different sorghum tisanes using a 9 point hedonic scale. Results showed an overall acceptability at 6. 63 ± 1. 54 for the sorghum tisane infused with a strawberry and lemon combination while the sorghum tisane with pineapple orange scored 6. 72. These results demonstrate the potential for introducing a consumer acceptable sorghum tisane into the market...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Tools {{for rolling}} steels and super alloys, which are {{nowadays}} in general made from steel or cemented carbides, suffer from wear and/or from surface cracking caused by thermal fatigue. New tools made from silicon nitride show improved performance {{in respect to}} thermal shock loading and wear. But their low toughness manifests also {{a high risk of}} brittle failure. Nevertheless the successful use of silicon nitride rolls with having more than a manifold lifetime (compared to the conventional solutions) has been reported in the last years [1 - 3]. In this paper earlier work of the Institut für Struktur- und Funktionskeramik at Montanuniversität Leoben on highly loaded silicon nitride rolls is summarized, where the limits of the Application of silicon nitride rolling tools are discussed. On the extreme example of rolls for super alloy wire rolling the behaviour of small surface cracks in the roll track is discussed. It is shown that – for the investigated conditions- rolling high strength steel wires is manageable but rolling of super alloy wires will cause the growth of fatigue cracks, which may destroy the rolls after some tons of rolled wire. A not trivial problem to be solved is the connection of the ceramic tool with the metal parts of the <b>roll</b> <b>stand.</b> Thermal strains of the metal parts can be several times larger than those of the silicon nitride ceramic and can therefore cause very high thermal misfit strains, even if the heating of metal parts seems to be modest. This case is discussed on the example of a catastrophically failed ceramic tool. This clearly shows that not only the tool but also the joint of the tool {{to the rest of the}} machinery has to be designed carefully. In summary this work demonstrates that a successful use of silicon nitride ceramic tools for cold and hot forming of metals and alloys is possible...|$|E
