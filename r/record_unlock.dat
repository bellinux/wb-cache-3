5000|$|Security (which is a {{panel on}} newer Palm OS devices) {{is used to}} {{configure}} Palm OS's security settings. These include the password needed to display hidden <b>records</b> and <b>unlock</b> the device when locked, as well as set up an automatic lockdown time or inactivity threshold. On the PC, only Palm Desktop honors this password but other PC programs can view everything—in other words, all the data protected by this password {{can be seen by}} anyone opening the [...]dat files using a text editor or word processor.|$|R

50|$|Since maximum {{scores for}} each song are {{normalized}} 50,000 regardless of difficulty, overall scores on songs can be compared. To achieve the gold record for a song, 12,500 points must be achieved. To achieve the platinum record for a song, 20,000 points must be achieved. Winning <b>records</b> will <b>unlock</b> additional characters, outfits, and songs. In Karaoke Revolution Party, Karaoke Revolution Country, Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol, and American Idol Encore, 50,000 points (a perfect score) earns a diamond record. In Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol Encore 2 the point system was changed so that 60,000 points gives a platinum record for a song and 100,000 points is a perfect score (diamond record).|$|R
40|$|The Unlocking Doors Project was {{a series}} of forums, {{workshops}} and consultations conducted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission throughout 2006, which brought Muslim people and communities in New South Wales and Victoria into a dialogue with Police. This dialogue sought to strengthen Muslim peoples’ relationship with law enforcement agencies and build on the capacity of the police to respond to the incidents of racial and religious hatred and abuse currently being experienced by Muslim people. The project was funded by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (then the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs). The following report <b>records</b> the <b>Unlocking</b> Doors Project: the dialogue that took place between Muslim peoples and police as well as the goals, processes and outcomes of the project...|$|R
50|$|Boost pads {{are used}} to {{accelerate}} 'into the zone' where racing lines and phantom cars are used {{in an attempt to}} set lap <b>records,</b> levels are <b>unlocked</b> by beating a set Zone-Time. There are shortcuts and secret pickups to be found with bonus rewards being earned by setting new best times. These bonus rewards can then be used to buy aerodynamic aids, various performance upgrades, new cars and skins which all help to give a speed increase when re-attempting levels.|$|R
5000|$|Two editions were {{released}} in Japan, a standard version including the Battle Gear Net Entry Key and a Limited Edition (初回限定版) bundled with a Tomica die-cast Nissan Skyline (R34) tuned by Taito original model. The [...] "Net Entry Key" [...] is a secure device manufactured by Nesys and designed {{with a personal}} code required to register the Battle Gear Net arena from the game's custom designed arcade cabinet only delivered in Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand. The key is used to compete in local game centers’ sponsored championships, to upload Best Time <b>records,</b> to <b>unlock</b> car parts and extra cars, and to save the personal tuning settings and custom plate. Once the key is registered, the gamer gets a unique Net ID and its associated password; Both are required to create a [...] "Network Game Profile" [...] savefile on the PlayStation 2 and access the [...] "Main Race" [...] section and its online exclusive contents such as the [...] "Event Race", [...] "Online Time Attack" [...] and [...] "Online Battle Gear" [...] extra game modes.|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of electronic health care <b>records</b> is <b>unlocking</b> {{the potential for}} novel studies on understanding and modeling disease co-morbidities based on both phenotypic and genetic data. Moreover, the insurgence of increasingly reliable phenotypic data can aid further studies on investigating the potential genetic links among diseases. The {{goal is to create}} a feedback loop where computational tools guide and facilitate research, leading to improved biological knowledge and clinical standards, which in turn should generate better data. We build and analyze disease interaction networks based on data collected from previous genetic association studies and patient medical histories, spanning over 12 years, acquired from a regional hospital. By exploring both individual and combined interactions among these two levels of disease data, we provide novel insight into the interplay between genetics and clinical realities. Our results show a marked difference between the well defined structure of genetic relationships and the chaotic co-morbidity network, but also highlight clear interdependencies. We demonstrate the power of these dependencies by proposing a novel multi-relational link prediction method, showing that disease co-morbidity can enhance our currently limited knowledge of genetic association. Furthermore, our methods for integrated networks of diverse data are widely applicable and can provide novel advances fo...|$|R
50|$|The player, {{taking on}} the role of the unnamed {{astronaut}} protagonist, returns from a failed 100-year voyage to 61 Cygni to find the Earth devoid of humans. Cars are rusted and covered with moss, the streets are completely barren, and everything appears as though the entire human race had just vanished suddenly. The player happens upon a barely functioning computer terminal that is tied into a storytelling mainframe, Homer. Through this interface, the player, assisted by Homer who attempts to weave the information into a coherent narrative, discovers information in order to piece together the occurrences leading to the disappearance of the human race. For instance, spending some time in the Medical <b>Records</b> section may <b>unlock</b> a piece of data in the Science section, and through these links the player can finish the game.|$|R
40|$|Visual {{surveillance}} {{systems are}} increasingly common {{in our society}} today. There is a conflict between the demands for security {{of the public and}} the demands to preserve the personal integrity. This thesis suggests a solution in which parts of the surveillance images are covered in order to conceal the identities of persons appearing in video, but not their actions or activities. The covered parts could be encrypted and unlocked only by the police or another legal authority in case of a crime. This thesis implements a proof-of-concept demonstrator using a combination of image processing techniques such as foreground segmentation, mathematical morphology, geometric camera calibration and region tracking. The demonstrator is capable of tracking a moderate number of moving objects and conceal their identity by replacing them with a mask or a blurred image. Functionality for replaying <b>recorded</b> data and <b>unlocking</b> individual persons are included. The concept demonstrator shows the chain from concealing the identities of persons to unlocking only a single person on recorded data. Evaluation on a publicly available dataset shows overall good performance...|$|R
5000|$|Letherette's musical style often draws {{comparisons}} to Hip Hop artists (such as Madlib, J Dilla and MF Doom) and French House acts (like Daft Punk, Alan Braxe and Breakbot). Their musical production involves heavy use of sampling but also incorporates live instrumentation ranging from [...] "guitars to synthesisers and various percussion instruments". In {{an interview with}} DJ Magazine they talk extensively about their use of sampling, including the comment [...] "we've always loved {{the idea that you}} can take the naffest track imaginable and sample certain parts to transform it into something you think is amazing. It's like you uncover a secret, in a way. The track was always there within the details of the <b>record,</b> and you <b>unlock</b> it with sampling.". The pairs music is often described as playful and fun, with Souncrash stating [...] "Fun is what sets Letherette apart", and Dazed & Confused saying that they [...] "bound between sounds characteristic of Warp and Roule but do so with a metaphorical piña colada in their hands".|$|R
