5000|$|William Donald Scherzer [...] (January 27, 1858 - July 20, 1893) was an American {{engineer}} {{who invented the}} <b>rolling</b> <b>lift</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
50|$|Scherzer was the {{inventor}} of a refinement of the Bascule bridge called the Scherzer <b>rolling</b> <b>lift</b> <b>bridge.</b> His last engineering work before he died, done in 1893, was the design of two of these rolling lift bridges in Chicago. His design pivots the bridge like a rocking horse. The friction is lowered because it is rolling friction. Moreover when the bridge is open the channel is completely free as the mechanism has rolled away the bridge from the edge leaving the passage free for wide traffic. The first <b>rolling</b> <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> ever built was the Van Buren Street Bridge {{in the city of}} Chicago and was patented by Scherzer. The second <b>rolling</b> <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> constructed spanned the Chicago River between Jackson and Van Buren Streets. These bridge projects were for the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad Company.|$|E

25|$|The first {{bridge across}} the Chicago River was {{constructed}} over the North Branch near the present day Kinzie Street in 1832. A second bridge, over the South Branch near Randolph Street, was added in 1833. The first moveable bridge was constructed across the main stem at Dearborn Street in 1834. Today, the Chicago River has 38 movable bridges spanning it, down {{from a peak of}} 52 bridges. These bridges are of several different types, including trunnion bascule, Scherzer <b>rolling</b> <b>lift,</b> swing <b>bridges,</b> and vertical <b>lift</b> <b>bridges.</b>|$|R
25|$|With a model {{bridge that}} was patent-free, had a fixed {{center of gravity}} and simple {{mechanical}} motion, in 1900 Ericson prompted the Chicago City Council to allocate funding to replace five deteriorating swing-span bridges. The first five bridges were built at Clybourn Place (later Cortland Avenue) in 1902, Division Street over both the North Branch Canal (1903) and the Chicago River (1904), 95th Street over the Calumet River (1903) and at Western Avenue over the North Branch Canal (1904). During {{the same period of}} time, the Scherzer Company built seven of their <b>rolling</b> <b>lift</b> <b>bridges</b> over the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, which was widened to accommodate larger flows from the recently reversed Chicago River. These bridges, built under the authority of the Chicago Sanitary District, only needed to be approved by the Corps of Engineers, not the Department of Public Works.|$|R

The Scheepsdalebrug (Scheepsdalebridge) in Brugge and the Sint-Annabrug over the river Dender in Aalst. The former combines the working mechanisms of a <b>rolling</b> <b>lift</b> bascule <b>bridge</b> and a tilt bridge: the bridge is mounted on two lifting arms which roll along racks, positioned parallel to the navigable way, tilting up the bridge leaf providing a clearance for passing ships. The latter is mounted on two lifting arms which are connected to fixed pivot points a few feet downstream from the bridge leaf.|$|R

50|$|Also {{known as}} the Connecticut River Railroad Bridge and Connecticut River Bridge, {{it was built in}} 1907 by the Scherzer <b>Rolling</b> <b>Lift</b> <b>Bridge</b> Company of Chicago, for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.

It also lacks the latter bridge's parallel sets of spans, although the abutments and piers were designed to carry such extra spans (for four total tracks) which were never installed at this location.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{trestle bridge}} {{effectively}} blocked marine traffic from {{passing through the}} east end of Cerritos Slough, the War Department ordered the Salt Lake Railroad to demolish it in 1906. Although a 3300 ft tunnel was proposed as a replacement in February 1907, the Salt Lake had already applied to replace the fixed trestle span with a drawbridge in September 1906. The location for the new drawbridge was set in May 1907, and the first piles were driven in December 1907. The bridge was completed in 1908 as a Scherzer <b>Rolling</b> <b>Lift</b> <b>Bridge.</b>|$|E

A quarter-mile west of Halsted Street (800 West) is the historic Fisk Generating Station from Carpenter to Loomis, and from Cermak south to the Chicago river. At {{the southwest corner of}} Throop Street (1300W) stands a red brick structure topped with a radio antennae-equipped gothic tower that formerly housed Commonwealth Edison garages and warehouses, then Warshawsky & Sons JC Whitney automoblie parts supplier, and most recently subdivided warehouse spaces and indoor futbol (soccer) fields.

5000|$|Part of the East Side Railroad Tunnel project, the Crook Point Bascule Bridge {{was built}} in 1908 to provide a direct {{connection}} to the old Union Station along the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad line.

When railroad usage declined in the 1970s and plans were made to demolish Union Station, the East Side Railroad Tunnel and the Seekonk River Drawbridge were subsequently abandoned in 1976 with the bridge fixed in its current open position to allow river transit.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge is}} a bascule bridge in a Scherzer <b>rolling</b> <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> configuration. The bridge's three spans are steel deck girders; the center span has girders of varying depth while the {{approach}} spans have uniform-depth girders. The center bascule span is 70 ft long, {{flanked by two}} 42 ft spans. The approach span road surface {{is a mixture of}} asphalt and concrete while the center span is a steel mesh. The 40 ft roadway is flanked by 5 ft sidewalks and standard moderne metal guard rails. On the downstream side of the north pier is the single-story bridge tender's house. When raised, a 60 ft navigable channel is available for marine vessels. The concrete abutments are founded on timber pilings and the two concrete piers rest on concrete footings supported by compact gravel 27 ft below the river surface. The piers are protected by angled cutwaters and cylindrical fenders upriver. The bridge was notable for its safety features. It has six light standards (three to a side) along its length for illumination. Traffic gates and traffic lights warn traffic when the bridge will rise for vessels.|$|E
