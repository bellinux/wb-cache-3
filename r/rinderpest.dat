5|$|Polio {{is one of}} {{only two}} {{diseases}} currently the subject of a global eradication program, the other being Guinea worm disease. So far, the only diseases completely eradicated by humankind are smallpox, declared so, in 1980, and <b>rinderpest,</b> likewise, in 2011.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rinderpest,</b> {{which is}} caused by a virus closely related to measles virus, is a disease of cattle known since Roman times. The disease, which {{originated}} in Asia, was first brought to Europe by the invading Huns in 370. Later invasions of Mongols, led by Genghis Khan and his army, started pandemics in Europe in 1222, 1233 and 1238. The infection subsequently reached England following the importation of cattle from the continent. At the time <b>rinderpest</b> was a devastating disease with a mortality rate of 80–90%. The resulting loss of cattle caused famine.|$|E
5|$|However, black {{wildebeest}} {{can also}} affect human beings negatively. Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock, and can transmit fatal diseases like <b>rinderpest</b> and cause epidemics among animals, particularly domestic cattle. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies and paramphistome flukes.|$|E
5|$|However, blue {{wildebeest}} {{can also}} affect human beings negatively. They {{can compete with}} domestic livestock for grazing and water and can transmit fatal diseases like <b>rinderpest</b> to cattle and cause epidemics among animals. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies and paramphistome flukes.|$|E
5|$|Epizootics are {{outbreaks}} (epidemics) {{of disease}} among non-human animals. During the 20th century significant epizootics of viral diseases in animals, particularly livestock, occurred worldwide. The many diseases caused by viruses included foot-and-mouth disease, <b>rinderpest</b> of cattle, avian and swine influenza, swine fever and bluetongue of sheep. Viral diseases of livestock {{can be devastating}} both to farmers and the wider community, as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in 2001 showed.|$|E
5|$|The {{social history}} of viruses {{describes}} the influence of viruses and viral infections on human history. Epidemics caused by viruses began when human behaviour changed during the Neolithic period, around 12,000 years ago, when humans developed more densely populated agricultural communities. This allowed viruses to spread rapidly and subsequently to become endemic. Viruses of plants and livestock also increased, and as humans became dependent on agriculture and farming, diseases such as potyviruses of potatoes and <b>rinderpest</b> of cattle had devastating consequences.|$|E
5|$|The {{wildebeest}} {{benefit the}} ecosystem by increasing soil fertility with their excreta. They are economically important {{for human beings}} as they are a major tourist attraction. They also provide important products like leather to humans. The wildebeest, however, can also {{have a negative impact}} on humans. Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock, and can transmit fatal diseases like <b>rinderpest</b> and cause epidemics among animals, particularly domestic cattle. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies and paramphistome flukes.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide array}} of {{bacterial}} and viral diseases affect sheep. Diseases of the hoof, such as foot rot and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies. These painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding. Ovine Johne's disease is a wasting disease that affects young sheep. Bluetongue disease is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the mucous membranes. Ovine <b>rinderpest</b> (or peste des petits ruminants) is a highly contagious and often fatal viral disease affecting sheep and goats.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas may {{contract}} brucellosis, <b>rinderpest</b> and anaplasmosis. They {{are vulnerable}} to Trypanosoma congolense, which is contracted by consuming already infected herbivores, rather than through direct infection from tsetse flies. It is known that adult spotted hyenas in the Serengeti have antibodies against rabies, canine herpes, canine brucella, canine parvovirus, feline calici, leptospirosis, bovine brucella, <b>rinderpest</b> and anaplasmosis. During the canine distemper outbreak of 1993–94, molecular studies indicated that the viruses isolated from hyenas and lions were {{more closely related to}} each other than to the closest canine distemper virus in dogs. Evidence of canine distemper in spotted hyenas has also been recorded in the Masai Mara. Exposure to rabies does not cause clinical symptoms or affect individual survival or longevity. Analyses of several hyena saliva samples showed that the species is unlikely to be a rabies vector, thus indicating that the species catches the disease from other animals rather than from intraspecifics. The microfilaria of Dipetalonema dracuneuloides have been recorded in spotted hyenas in northern Kenya. The species is known to carry at least three cestode species of the genus Taenia, none of which are harmful to humans. It also carries protozoan parasites of the genus Hepatozoon in the Serengeti, Kenya and South Africa. Spotted hyenas may act as hosts in the life-cycles of various parasites which start life in herbivores; Taenia hyaenae and T. olnogojinae occur in hyenas in their adult phase. Trichinella spiralis are found as cysts in hyena muscles.|$|E
5|$|The lesser kudu's shyness and {{its ability}} to {{camouflage}} itself in dense cover has protected it from the risks of poaching. For instance, the lesser kudu is widespread in the Ogaden region, which is rich in dense bush, despite reckless hunting by local people. However, <b>rinderpest</b> outbreaks, to which the lesser kudu is highly susceptible, have resulted in a steep decline of 60% in the animal's population in Tsavo National Park in Kenya. Overgrazing, human settlement, and loss of habitat are some other threats to the survival of the lesser kudu.|$|E
5|$|Some parasites feed on giraffes. They {{are often}} hosts for ticks, {{especially}} {{in the area around}} the genitals, which has thinner skin than other areas. Tick species that commonly feed on giraffes are those of genera Hyalomma, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus. Giraffes may rely on red-billed and yellow-billed oxpeckers to clean them of ticks and alert them to danger. Giraffes host numerous species of internal parasite and are susceptible to various diseases. They were victims of the (now eradicated) viral illness <b>rinderpest.</b> Giraffes can also suffer from a skin disorder, which {{comes in the form of}} wrinkles, lesions or raw fissures. It appears to be caused by a nematode and may be further effected by fungal infections. As much as 79% of giraffes show signs of the disease in Ruaha National Park.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to the Netherlands, H.P.N. Muller settled down in The Hague, where he was {{originally}} only occupied with his consular duties for Liberia, his membership of the Commission for Consular Examinations (since 1890) and his writing. Early in 1896 Muller was appointed as consul for the Orange Free State in the provinces of North and South Holland, assisting the consul general H.A.L. Hamelberg. He received the appointment on the strength of his publications about South Africa. After Hamelberg's death later in 1896 Muller succeeded him as consul general. It was an honorary position. In the following years Muller wholeheartedly set out to work for the Orange Free State and its interests in Europe. His predecessor Hamelberg had not only been consul general, but had on occasion also acted as special envoy to be able to negotiate treaties and accords with foreign powers. Muller also acted as special envoy and in this capacity inter alia enrolled the Orange Free State in the Universal Postal Union, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, and the Geneva Conventions, and negotiated treaties of friendship and trade with Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. He also strengthened the consular representation of the Orange Free State in Europe and inquired into all kinds of practical issues like a cure for <b>rinderpest</b> and improved methods of irrigation.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, however, an {{outbreak}} of <b>rinderpest</b> from Sudan spread throughout Africa, killing millions of cattle, as well as wildlife. In response, the Pan-African <b>Rinderpest</b> Campaign was initiated in 1987, using vaccination and surveillance to combat the disease. By the 1990s, nearly all of Africa, {{with the exception of}} parts of Sudan and Somalia, was declared free of <b>rinderpest.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dr Walter Plowright {{was awarded}} the World Food Prize in 1999 for {{developing}} a vaccine against <b>rinderpest.</b> Development work on the Plowright vaccine for the RBOK strain of the <b>rinderpest</b> virus lasted from about 1956 to 1962.|$|E
25|$|Between 1888 and 1892, {{northern}} Ethiopia {{experienced a}} devastating famine. The famine {{was caused by}} <b>rinderpest</b> that killed the majority of all cattle (see 1890s African <b>rinderpest</b> epizootic). Conditions worsened with cholera outbreaks (1889–92), a typhus epidemic, and a major smallpox epidemic (1889–90).|$|E
25|$|Stocks of the <b>rinderpest</b> virus {{are still}} {{maintained}} by highly specialized laboratories. In 2015, FAO {{launched a campaign}} calling for the destruction or sequestering of the remaining stocks of <b>rinderpest</b> virus in laboratories in 24 different countries, claiming risks of inadvertent or malicious release.|$|E
25|$|Widespread {{eradication}} efforts {{took place}} {{as soon as}} the early 1900s; in 1924, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) was formed in response to <b>rinderpest.</b> Until the mid-1900s, eradication efforts largely took place on an individual country basis, using vaccination campaigns. In 1950, the Inter-African Bureau of Epizootic Diseases was formed, with the stated goal of eliminating <b>rinderpest</b> from Africa. During the 1960s, a program called JP 15 attempted to vaccinate all cattle in participating countries; by 1979, only one of the countries involved, Sudan, reported cases of <b>rinderpest.</b>|$|E
25|$|FAO {{established}} an Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases in 1994, {{focusing on the}} control of diseases like <b>rinderpest,</b> foot-and-mouth disease and avian flu by helping governments coordinate their responses. One key element is the Global <b>Rinderpest</b> Eradication Programme, which has advanced to a stage where large tracts of Asia and Africa have now been free of the cattle disease <b>rinderpest</b> {{for an extended period}} of time. Meanwhile, Locust Watch monitors the worldwide locust situation and keeps affected countries and donors informed of expected developments.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide, the Global <b>Rinderpest</b> Eradication Programme was {{initiated}} in 1994, {{supported by the}} Food and Agriculture Organization, the OIE, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. This program was successful in reducing <b>rinderpest</b> outbreaks to {{few and far between}} by the late 1990s. The program is estimated to have saved affected farmers 58 million net Euro.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rinderpest</b> {{eradication}} {{effort is}} estimated to have cost $5 billion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rinderpest</b> (also cattle plague or steppe murrain) was an {{infectious}} viral disease of cattle, domestic buffalo, {{and some other}} species of even-toed ungulates, including buffaloes, large antelope and deer, giraffes, wildebeests, and warthogs. The disease was characterized by fever, oral erosions, diarrhea, lymphoid necrosis, and high mortality. Death rates during outbreaks were usually extremely high, approaching 100% in immunologically naïve populations. <b>Rinderpest</b> was mainly transmitted by direct contact and by drinking contaminated water, although {{it could also be}} transmitted by air. After a global eradication campaign, the last confirmed case of <b>rinderpest</b> was diagnosed in 2001.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rinderpest</b> virus, which {{infected}} domestic cattle, is now {{extinct in}} the wild.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, the FAO {{predicted}} that with vaccination, <b>rinderpest</b> would be eradicated by 2010.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rinderpest</b> {{was also}} {{considered}} as a biological weapon in the United Kingdom's program during World War II.|$|E
25|$|In {{his classic}} {{study of the}} Nuer of {{southern}} Sudan, E. E. Evans-Pritchard suggested <b>rinderpest</b> might have affected the Nuer's social organization {{before and during the}} 1930s. Since the Nuer were pastoralists, much of their livelihood was based on cattle husbandry, and bride-prices were paid in cattle; prices may have changed as a result of cattle depletion. <b>Rinderpest</b> might also have increased dependence on horticulture among the Nuer.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, too, {{interest}} in <b>rinderpest</b> inoculation {{declined in the}} 1780s because the disease itself decreased in intensity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rinderpest</b> {{was one of}} {{more than}} a dozen agents the United States {{researched}} as potential biological weapons before terminating its biological weapons program.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, as Acting Resident Counciilor of Malacca, Bland {{had ordered}} the {{slaughter}} of twenty-eight buffaloes and five cows {{in order to help}} check an outbreak of <b>rinderpest</b> that had occurred during the year. He had done this without carefully observing the law that provided for no slaughter unless first examined by a qualified veterinary surgeon and pronounced to be infected with <b>rinderpest.</b> In November that year, the Legislative Council, without any dissenting voices, voted $1,005 to compensate owners of the animals slaughtered by Bland.|$|E
25|$|The {{depopulated}} {{and apparently}} primevally wild Africa seen in wildlife documentary films {{was formed in}} the 19th century by disease, a combination of <b>rinderpest</b> and the tsetse fly. In 1887, the <b>rinderpest</b> virus was accidentally imported in livestock brought by an Italian expeditionary force to Eritrea. It spread rapidly, reaching Ethiopia by 1888, the Atlantic coast by 1892, and South Africa by 1897. <b>Rinderpest,</b> a cattle plague from central Asia, killed over 90% of the cattle of the pastoral peoples such as the Masai of east Africa. With no native immunity, most of the population – some 5.5 million cattle – died in southern Africa. Pastoralists were left with no animals, their source of income; farmers were deprived of their working animals for ploughing and irrigation. The pandemic coincided with a period of drought, causing widespread famine. The starving human populations died of smallpox, cholera, typhoid and diseases imported from Europe. It is estimated that {{two thirds of the}} Masai died in 1891.|$|E
25|$|Distemper {{is caused}} by a {{single-stranded}} RNA virus of the family Paramyxoviridae, which is a close relative of the viruses that cause measles in humans and <b>rinderpest</b> in animals.|$|E
25|$|In 1917-18, Dr. William Hutchins Boynton (1881-1959) {{the chief}} {{veterinary}} pathologist with the Philippine Bureau of Agriculture developed an early vaccine for <b>rinderpest,</b> based on treated animal organ extracts.|$|E
25|$|Measles virus {{evolved from}} the then-widespread <b>rinderpest</b> virus most {{probably}} between the 11th and 12th centuries. The earliest likely origin is during the seventh century; some linguistic evidence exists for this earlier origin.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, an {{outbreak}} of the disease originated in Afghanistan, travelling westwards and promoting a mass vaccination plan, which, by 1972, had eliminated <b>rinderpest</b> {{in all areas of}} Asia except for Lebanon and India; both countries were the site of further occurrences of the disease in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rinderpest</b> virus (RPV), {{a member}} of the genus Morbillivirus, is closely related to the measles and canine {{distemper}} viruses. Like other members of the Paramyxoviridae family, it produces enveloped virions, and is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus. The virus was particularly fragile and is quickly inactivated by heat, desiccation and sunlight.|$|E
25|$|Paramyxoviruses {{are also}} {{responsible}} {{for a range of}} diseases in other animal species, for example canine distemper virus (dogs), phocine distemper virus (seals), cetacean morbillivirus (dolphins and porpoises), Newcastle disease virus (birds), and <b>rinderpest</b> virus (cattle). Some paramyxoviruses such as the henipaviruses are zoonotic pathogens, occurring naturally in an animal host, but also able to infect humans.|$|E
25|$|The last {{confirmed}} case of <b>rinderpest</b> {{was reported in}} Kenya in 2001. Since then, while {{there have been no}} {{confirmed case}}s, the disease {{is believed to have been}} present in parts of Somalia past that date. The final vaccinations were administered in 2006, and the last surveillance operations took place in 2009, failing to find any evidence of the disease.|$|E
