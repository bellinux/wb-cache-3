There have been several initiatives by the European Commission to support and <b>research</b> <b>design</b> and design management in recent years. However, a European-wide policy to support design has never been planned, due to the inconsistencies and differences in design policies in each nation.

25|$|In these {{double-blind}} experiments, {{neither the}} participants nor the researchers know which participants {{belong to the}} control group, nor the test group. Only after all data have been recorded (and, in some cases, analyzed) do the researchers learn which participants were which. Performing an experiment in double-blind fashion can greatly lessen the power of preconceived notions or physical cues (e.g., the placebo effect, observer bias, experimenter's bias) to distort the results (by making researchers or participants behave differently from in everyday life). Random assignment of test subjects to the experimental and control groups is {{a critical part of}} any double-blind <b>research</b> <b>design.</b> The key that identifies the subjects and which group they belonged to is kept by a third party, and is not revealed to the researchers until the study is over.|$|E
3000|$|Case study <b>research</b> <b>designs</b> will be {{analyzed}} regarding their various strengths on a theory continuum. Edmondson and McManus (2007) initiated {{a debate on}} whether the stage of theory fits to research questions, style of data collection, and analyses. Similarly, Colquitt and Zapata-Phelan (2007) created a taxonomy capturing facets of empirical article’s theoretical contributions by distinguishing between theory-building and theory testing. Corley and Gioia (2011) extended this debate {{by focusing on the}} practicality of theory and the importance of prescience. While these papers consider the whole range of methodological approaches on a higher level, they treat case studies as relatively homogeneous. This paper aims to delve into a deeper level of analysis by solely focusing on case study <b>research</b> <b>designs</b> and their respective fit on this theory continuum. This approach offers a more fine-grained understanding that sheds light on the diversity of case study <b>research</b> <b>designs</b> in terms of their differential theory contributions.

His writings range from abstract, metatheoretical problems to very direct and 'down-to-earth' textbooks for students. His textbook, Sociology, first published in 1988, is currently in its eighth edition. Finally, he is also known for his interdisciplinary approach: he has commented not only on the developments in sociology, but also in anthropology, archaeology, psychology, philosophy, history, linguistics, economics, social work and most recently, political science. In view of his knowledge and works, one may view much of his life's work as a form of 'grand ' of sociological theory.|$|E
