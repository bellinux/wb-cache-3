5000|$|A 2006 bioarchaeological {{study on}} the dental {{morphology}} of ancient Egyptians in Upper Egypt by Joel Irish found that their dental traits were most {{similar to those of}} other Nile Valley populations, with more remote ties with Bronze Age to Christian period Nubians (e.g. A-Group, C-Group, Kerma) and other Afro-Asiatic speaking populations in Northeast Africa (Tigrean). However, the Egyptian groups were generally distinct from the sampled West and Central African populations. Among the samples included in the study is skeletal material from the Hawara tombs of Fayum, (from the Roman period) which clustered very closely with the Badarian series of the predynastic period. All the samples, particularly those of the Dynastic period, were significantly divergent from a neolithic West Saharan sample from Lower Nubia. Biological continuity was also found intact from the dynastic to the post-pharaonic periods. According to Irish: [...] Egyptian samples 996 mummies exhibit morphologically simple, mass-reduced dentitions that are similar to those in populations from greater North Africa (Irish, 1993, 1998a-c, 2000) and, to a lesser extent, western Asia and Europe (Turner, 1985a; Turner and Markowitz, 1990; <b>Roler,</b> 1992; Lipschultz, 1996; Irish, 1998a).|$|E

Among the samples included in the study is skeletal material from the Hawara tombs of Fayum, which clustered very closely with the Badarian series of the predynastic period. All the samples, particularly those of the Dynastic period, were significantly divergent from a neolithic West Saharan sample from Lower Nubia.

Similar craniofacial measurements among samples from these regions were reported as well (Brace et al., 1993)... an inspection of MMD values reveals no evidence of increasing phenetic distance between samples from the first and second halves of this almost 3,000-year-long period. For example, phenetic distances between First-Second Dynasty Abydos and samples from Fourth Dynasty Saqqara (MMD ¼ 0.050), 11-12th Dynasty Thebes (0.000), 12th Dynasty Lisht (0.072), 19th Dynasty Qurneh (0.053), and 26th-30th Dynasty Giza (0.027) do not exhibit a directional increase through time... Thus, despite increasing foreign influence after the Second Intermediate Period, not only did Egyptian culture remain intact (Lloyd, 2000a), but the people themselves, as represented by the dental samples, appear biologically constant as well... Gebel Ramlah Nubian/Western Desert sample is, in fact, significantly different from Badari based on the 22-trait MMD (Table 4). For that matter, the Neolithic Western Desert sample is significantly different from all others but is closest to predynastic and early dynastic samples.|$|E

30|$|The role of {{infrastructure}} {{in the development}} and economic growth of society has been studied extensively over the last few decades. Empirical studies of the effects {{of infrastructure}} development on growth and income distribution have been performed across large number of (developed and developing) nations (Hardy [1980]; <b>Röler</b> and Waverman [2001]; Calderón and Servén [2004]; Datta and Agarwalb [2004]; Lam and Shiu [2010]; Forestiera et al.

Correlation and econometric analyses indicate that economic growth and, often, the reduction of income inequality are positively affected by the stock (in quantity and quality) of infrastructure (Calderón and Servén [2004]). These variables also exhibit causal relationships in developing nations in Asia and Africa (Hardy [1980]; <b>Röler</b> and Waverman [2001]; Ding and Haynes [2006]; Lall [2007]; Ssewanyana [2007]; Calderón and Servén [2010]; Sahooa and Dashb [2012]; Singh et al.

[2002]) a trend that we uncover in Côte d’Ivoire below. Other studies emphasize that the effects of telecommunication on economic growth are nonlinear, exhibiting strong scaling returns upon inception (Ding and Haynes [2006]; Gruber and Koutroumpis [2011]), but also potentially requiring near universal access to realize their full network potential and, in some cases, a level of critical mass penetration (<b>Röler</b> and Waverman [2001]; Vu [2011]).|$|E

From {{the moment}} of birth, the normal foal's activity is highly predictable. It will begin rhythmic breathing within 30 seconds and become sternal within 5 minutes. The sucking reflex will be present within 20 minutes, and in approximately one hour, the foal will stand. By 1 1 / 2 hours post-partum, the foal will have begun suckling from the mare. From this time onward, suckling will occur at regular 30 - 50 minute intervals. Meconium excretion and micturition are seen within 15 hours post-partum. Given such a defined and familiar routine, the knowledgeable horse owner easily recognized a breakdown in this behavioral pattern during the neonatal period, which is defined here as the first four days of the foal's life.

40|$|O início deste novo século trouxe consigo muitas mudanças resultantes de alterações sociais e tecnológicas, às quais a mulher foi submetida. Ela vivencia uma época de inexistência de verdades absolutas e convive com o imprevisível. Seu papel passou por transformações ao longo dos anos que podem ser observadas {{inclusive}} no âmbito religioso. Estas situações exigem adaptações constantes e todo processo de adaptação desencadeia o processo de estresse. Estima-se que a incidência do estresse no Brasil seja de 32 % na população adulta, sendo as mulheres as mais atingidas. O pensamento pós moderno trouxe a possibilidade de perceber a religião e a espiritualidade como aspectos importantes da experiência humana. As tradições religiosas em geral não acompanharam as mudanças e não ofereceram novos rituais para as transições, tais como o divórcio, o desemprego, as famílias recompostas. Desconectadas de rituais, as pessoas podem ficar presas em emoções específicas. Esta dissertação apresenta uma possibilidade de correlacionar o conceito de coping religioso com as estratégias de adaptação da mulher de cultura presbiteriana na situação de estresse. Tem-se como objetivo identificar as formas utilizadas pelo sujeito da amostra para enfrentar as situações estressoras e arrolar os facilitadores que promovam ajustamento nestas condições. O sujeito da pesquisa é a mulher presbiteriana com tempo médio de frequência de 24 anos em igreja localizada na cidade de São Paulo. A amostra é composta por 52 mulheres voluntárias, na faixa etária entre os 25 e 72 anos. Os recursos técnicos são o Questionário Geral, WHOQOL_BREF, o Levantamento de sintomas de stress e a Escala de Coping Religioso Espiritual. O estresse continuará a fazer parte da vida de homens e mulheres, mas o ser humano tem a capacidade de aprender estratégias de enfrentamento. Uma das maneiras de se manejar o estresse é através da religião. Trata-se do coping religioso. Apresenta-se a psicoterapia espiritualmente integrada como agente facilitador para o processo de estresse. Para a amostra representada nesta pesquisa, o coping religioso mostrou-se dominante como busca por significado em tempos de crise. A área que demanda maiores esforços para a mulher presbiteriana é a família. A ansiedade é a emoção/sentimento mais vivenciada pelas participantes. Para lidar com as situações difíceis, as voluntárias oram e também comunicam seus sentimentos desagradáveis para algumas pessoas. A igreja é mencionada como facilitadora da saúde emocional. The {{beginning of}} this new century brought lots of changes, resulting from social and technological changes, wich women are submitted. They live {{in a time of}} no absolute truths and have to deal the unpredictable. Her <b>roler</b> passed through transformations during the years and it can be observed even in the religious sphere. These situations require constants adaptations, and all this process triggers a stress process. The incidence of stress in Brazil estimated in 32 % of the adult population, and women are the most affected. The postmodern thought also brought the possibility of perceiveing the religion and the spirituality as important aspects of human experience. The religious traditions overall, didn&# 8223;t follow the changes and didnt offer new rituals to the transitions, such as divorce, unemployment and extended families. Disconnected from rituals people may get stuck in specific emotions. This dissertation presents a possibility of correlating the concept of religious coping with adaptation strategies of Presbyterian women facing the daily stress. The overall goal of the research is to identify the forms used by the individual to face the stressor situations and enroll the facilitators that promote its adjustment in these situations. The research subject are women who attend Presbyterian churches with a mean frequency of 24 years in the city of São Paulo. The sample consists of 52 volunteer women, whose ages oscillate between 25 and 72 years. The technical resources are the General Questionnaire, WHOQOL_BREF, the Survey of symptoms of stress and the Scale of religious-spiritual coping. The stress will still be part of the life of men and women, but the humans have ability to learn coping strategies. And that&# 8223;s why the researches in this area assume importance. One of the ways to handle the stress is through religion, and it is known by religious coping. The psychotherapy spiritually integrated is a facilitator for the stress process. For the sample of this research, the religious coping proved to be dominant as search for meaning in crisis times. The area that requires more efforts from the Presbyterian women is the family. The anxiety is the emotion/feeling most experienced by the participants. To deal with tough situations, the volunteers pray and also communicate their unpleasant feelings to some people. Furthermore the church is perceived as a facilitator of emotional health...|$|E
