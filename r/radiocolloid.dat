5|$|Animal {{studies show}} that astatine, {{similarly}} to iodine, although to a lesser extent, is preferentially concentrated in the thyroid gland. Unlike iodine, astatine also shows {{a tendency to be}} taken up by the lungs and spleen, possibly because of in-body oxidation of At– to At+. If administered {{in the form of a}} <b>radiocolloid</b> it tends to concentrate in the liver. Experiments in rats and monkeys suggest that astatine-211 causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine-131, with repetitive injection of the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell dysplasia within the gland. Early research suggested that injection of astatine into female rodents caused morphological changes in breast tissue; this conclusion remained controversial for many years. General agreement was later reached that this was likely caused by the effect of breast tissue irradiation combined with hormonal changes due to irradiation of the ovaries. Trace amounts of astatine can be handled safely in fume hoods if they are well-aerated; biological uptake of the element must be avoided.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Sentinel {{lymph node}} biopsy (SLNB) has become a widely {{accepted}} staging procedure for both breast carcinoma and melanoma. The aim of our study was to systematically review different SLNB techniques and perform a meta-analysis for corresponding identification and false-negative rates. Methods: A systematic {{review of the literature}} on SLNB in patients with early stage breast carcinoma and melanoma was performed. Only original study groups were included. The SLN identification rate and false negative rate were pooled for patients with breast carcinoma or melanoma according to <b>radiocolloid</b> tracer, blue dye, indocyanine green (ICG), or a combination of a <b>radiocolloid</b> tracer with blue dye or ICG. Results: Between 1992 and 2012, a total of 154 studies (88 breast carcinoma and 66 melanoma) were reported that met our eligibility criteria. These studies included a total of 44, 172 patients. The pooled SLN identification rate in breast carcinoma and melanoma patients using solely blue dye was 85 % (range: 65 - 100 %) and 84 % (range: 59 - 100 %), while for <b>radiocolloid</b> alone it was 94 % (range: 67 - 100 %) and 99 % (range: 83 - 100 %), respectively. Using a combination of <b>radiocolloid</b> and blue, identification rates were 95 % (range 94 - 95 %) and 98 % (range: 98 - 98 %). Conclusions: The current meta-analysis provides data that favors the use of <b>radiocolloid</b> or <b>radiocolloid</b> combined with a blue dye for SLN identification. Perfoiming SLNB with <b>radiocolloid</b> alone is the technique of choice for experienced surgeons, since blue dye has multiple disadvantages. SLNB using ICG as a fluorescent dye seems a promising technique for the near future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{primary role}} of {{sentinel}} lymph node (SLN) mapping in colon cancer {{is to increase}} the accuracy of nodal staging by identifying those lymph nodes with the greatest potential for harbouring metastatic disease. Ultrastaging techniques aim to identify the otherwise undetected metastases. Until now, no consensus exists as to the most optimal procedure in patients with colon cancer. METHODS: A systematic literature search on the value of different SLN mapping techniques in patients with colon cancer was performed using the electronic search engine PubMed. Prospective studies published before 1 December 2005 were included and further articles were selected by cross-referencing. The results of different techniques using either blue dye or <b>radiocolloid,</b> were investigated. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 17 relevant articles. SLN mapping using blue dye was described in 15 studies. Two studies reported the results of SLN mapping using a combination of blue dye and <b>radiocolloid.</b> The reported results on identification rate varied between 71 and 100 %. Accuracy rates were between 78 and 100 %, sensitivity rates between 25 and 100 % and true upstaging rates between 0 and 26 %. The results were not affected by the addition of <b>radiocolloid</b> to blue dye. CONCLUSIONS: Sentinel lymph node mapping in patients with colon cancer remains an experimental procedure with varying results. Further evaluation may lead to a standardized technique that offers the potential for significant upstaging of stage II patients.

40|$|Recently, {{there is}} {{increased}} concern that <b>radiocolloids</b> may {{act as a}} rapid transport mechanism {{for the release of}} radionuclides from high-level waste repositories. The role of colloids is, however, controversial because the necessary data and assessment methodology have been limited. Evidence is accumulating to indicate that colloids are an important consideration in the geological disposal of nuclear waste. To quantitatively assess the role of colloids, the TRACR 3 D transport code has been enhanced by the addition of the population balance equations. This new version of the code can simulate the migration of colloids through combinations of porous/fractured, unsaturated, geologic media. The code was tested against the experimental laboratory column data of Avogadro et al. in order to compare the code results to both experimental data and an analytical solution. Next, a low-level radioactive waste site was investigated to explore whether colloid migration could account for the unusually rapid and long transport of plutonium and americium observed at a low-level waste site. Both plutonium and americium migrated 30 meters through unsaturated volcanic tuff.

We aimed to compare the three <b>radiocolloids</b> [99 mTc-antimony trisulfide colloid (ASC), 99 mTc-tin colloid (TC), and 99 mTc-human serum albumin (HSA) ] for sentinel lymph node mapping. Subjects and Methods: Totally, 397 patients with clinically N 0 stage were enrolled. 99 mTc-ASC was injected in 202 out of 397 patients, 99 mTc-TC was injected in 120 patients, and 99 mTc-HSA was injected in the remaining 75 patients. The sentinel lymph nodes were localized by lymphoscintigraphy and selected using intraoperative gamma probe. All sentinel lymph nodes were investigated by intraoperative pathologic consultation. The axillary lymph nodes which were harvested by the lymph node dissection were also investigated. Results: The patients of each group showed similar clinical characteristics. There were no significant differences (p> 0. 05) in the identification rate of sentinel lymph nodes (IR), false negative rate (FNR), and negative predictive value (NPV). The axillary lymphadenectomy revealed axillary lymph node metastases in those three groups (ASC- 33. 2 %, TC- 31. 7 %, HSA- 22. 7 %).

40|$|Introduction: Monoclonal {{antibodies}} labeled {{mainly with}} 99 mTc are being widely used as imaging agents in nuclear medicine. Recently PR 81 was introduced {{as a new}} murine anti-MUC 1 MAb against human breast carcinoma. This antibody reacts with the tandem repeat of 20 -mer peptide of protein backbone, and is of IgG 1 class, with an affinity of 2. 19 &times; 10 - 8 M- 1. Due to high specific reactivity, this antibody was shown to have high diagnostic potential in nuclear medicine. As the first step towards {{the use of an}} antibody for imaging purposes it has to be labeled with a radioisotope. In this study we have investigated a method for optimum labeling of this MAb with 99 mTc. Materials and Methods: The Ab reduction was performed with 2 -mercaptoethanol (2 -ME) at a molar ratio of 2000 : 1 (2 -ME:MAb) and reduced Ab was labeled with 99 mTc via stannous tartrate as a transchelator. The labeling efficiency was determined by ITLC. The integrity of reduced MAb was checked by means of SDS-PAGE and gel filtration chromatography (FPLC) on Superose 12 HR 10 / 30 (purity&gt; 99 %). The amount of <b>radiocolloids</b> were measured by cellulose nitrate electrophoresis. In vitro stability of labeled product was checked in time intervals over 24 hrs by ITLC. Radioimmunoassay was used to test immunoreactivity of the labeled MAb. Biodistribution of the radiolabeled MAb was studied in normal mice at 4 and 24 hrs post-injection. Results: The labeling efficiency was % 96 &plusmn; 2. 8 with high invitro stability (% 82 &plusmn; 2. 7 in 24 hrs) and less than % 2 <b>radiocolloids</b> were found. There was no Ab fragmentation due to reduction procedure. Both labeled and unlabeled MAbs were able to compete for binding to the MUC 1.

Radioimmunoscin-tigraphy is a technique which uses radiolabeled anti-bodies to visualize tumors, taking advantage of anti-gens preferentially expressed by malignant tissues. The PR 81 is a new murine anti-MUC 1 monoclonal antibody that was found to react with the membrane extracts of several human breast cancerous tissues. In this study we have developed a method for direct la-beling of this MAb with 99 mTc which is very simple, rapid and efficient. The quality control of the new agent and imaging studies in BALB/c mice bearing breast tumor xenografts were performed. Materials & Methods: The Ab reduction was per-formed with 2 -mercaptoethanol (2 -ME) at a molar ratio of 2000 : 1 (2 -ME:MAb) and reduced Ab was la-beled with 99 mTc via methylene diphosphonate (MDP) as a transchelator. The labeling efficiency was determined by ITLC. The amount of <b>radiocolloids</b> was measured by cellulose nitrate electrophoresis. Stability of labeled product was checked in fresh hu-man serum by gel filtration chromatography (FPLC) over 24 hrs. The integrity of labeled MAb was checked by means of SDS-PAGE. Cell-binding assay was used to test binding ability of 99 mTc-PR 81 to MCF 7 cells. Biodistribution was studied in normal BALB/c mice at 4 and 24 hr post-injection. The tumor imag-ing was performed in female BALB/c mice with breast tumor xenografts at 24 hr after the new com-plex injection. Results: The labeling efficiency was 94. 2 %± 2. 3 and <b>radiocolloids</b> were 2. 5 %± 1. 7. In vitro stability was 70 %± 5. 7 in fresh human serum over 24 hrs.

40|$|Background: Sentinel {{lymph node}} (SLN) biopsy can replace {{axillary}} lymph node dissection(ALND) in prediction of nodal status in node-negative breast cancer. However, patients presenting with multifocal/multicentric (MF/MC) breastcancer are usually excluded from studies of SLN biopsy. This study evaluatedthe efficacy of SLN biopsy in patients with MF/MC breast cancer. Methods: Breast cancer patients who underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy andSLN biopsy with backup ALND from 2004 to 2006 were retrospectivelyreviewed.

The identification rate, sensitivity, accuracy, and falsenegativerate for unifocal and MF/MC breast cancers were 94. 8 %, 92. 6 %, 98. 4 %, and 7. 4 %; and 100 %, 100 %, 100 %, and 0 %, respectively. No significantdifferences were observed {{between the two groups}} for SLN identification,sensitivity, accuracy, and false-negative rate. Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node biopsy using intradermal <b>radiocolloid</b> injection methodis feasible for MF/MC breast cancer...|$|E
30|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that sentinel LN biopsy (SLNB), with or without dissection, also has {{an important role in}} CC investigation [24, 39]. According to the revised FIGO, SLNB is still experimental and more evidence is needed to support its inclusion in routine practice. SLNB may be particularly useful in early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO stage IA, IB 1, and IB 2). Dual labeling using blue dye and <b>radiocolloid</b> increases the accuracy of sentinel LN detection, and a near-infrared technique using indocyanine green dye has been applied in robotic surgery and laparoscopy. Pelvic lymphadenectomy must be considered when LVSI is present [26].|$|E
40|$|Six {{groups of}} 3 rabbits each were immunised with {{ovalbumin}} and received one intra-articular injection of antigen. The animals of 3 groups received local x-ray irradiation of 600 rads for 8 minutes {{to the right}} knee joint 12 days after the intra-articular challenge. Animals of the other 3 groups were not irradiated. The antigen-induced arthritis was investigated by determining the exudation is synovial fluid and by histological study of the synovium examined 48 hours, 7 days, and 4 weeks after the irradiation date. All animals in the nonirradiated groups showed a distinct chronic synovitis. Irradiated animals showed almost no synovitis 48 hours and 7 days following irradiation. In 2 rabbits synovitis had reappeared 4 weeks after irradiation with findings {{similar to those in}} the control groups. Only one animal still showed an inhibition of synovitis. X-ray irradiation of non-challenged knees did not induce any pathological changes. This time-limited effect of one local irradiation on antigen-induced arthritis seems to be mainly an anti-inflammatory action. Local immunological inhibition might possibly operate too. X-ray induced inhibition of synovitis is compared with the effect of locally injected <b>radiocolloids...</b>|$|R
40|$|To improve {{surgical}} guidance toward prostate draining lymph nodes, {{we investigate}} {{the potential of}} intraoperative fluorescence imaging and combined pre- and intraoperative multimodality imaging approaches. Transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate mice with spontaneous prostate tumors are injected intratumorally with: 1. a cocktail of patent blue (Pb) and indocyanine green (ICG); 2. a cocktail of albumin <b>radiocolloids</b> (99 mTc-NanoColl), Pb, and ICG; or 3. a cocktail of radiolabeled albumin (99 mTc-Vasculosis), Pb, and ICG. The distribution of these imaging agents over the lymph nodes (LNs) are studied at different time points after injection. We find that at 60 -min postinjection, ICG significantly improves the detection of the LNs compared to Pb, 53 versus 7 %, respectively. Moreover, a cocktail of ICG and 99 mTc-NanoColl improves the fluorescent detection rate to 86 %, equalling that of the clinically applied 99 mTc-NanoColl. A similar overlap is observed in our initial clinical pilot data. Fluorescent detection of the LNs using a ICG with 99 mTc-Vasculosis gives similar results as "free" ICG (58 %; 60 min). A 99 mTc-NanoColl, Pb, and cocktail ICG enriches the standard 99 mTc-NanoColl approach by adding optical detection of the sentinel lymph nodes. Furthermore, this approach improves fluorescent-based guidance and enables both accurate surgical planning and intraoperative detection, based on a single injectio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundMedical {{isotopes}} {{are required}} for sentinel node lymphoscintigraphy in breast cancer, but are in critical shortage. Our center uses a modification of the standard SC, called CRC, that {{has been shown to}} require less medical isotope for the same procedure. Our objective was to determine if {{there was a significant difference}} between SC and CRC in successful lymph node identification in breast cancer patients. Patients and MethodsThis was a retrospective cohort study using prospectively-collected data on 1205 consecutive early, clinically node-negative breast cancer patients who underwent a SNB between 2002 and 2008 at 2 tertiary hospitals in Canada. ResultsThere was no difference in successful lymph node identification rate (P =. 50) or in the mean number of positive nodes identified between the 2 colloids (P =. 88). The CRC group had a significantly lower rate of delayed adverse events (4. 91 % vs. 0. 59 %, P <. 0001) even after adjusting for whether axillary dissection occurred on the same day as the biopsy (adjusted odds ratio, 0. 12; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 04 - 0. 40; P =. 001). ConclusionOur findings suggest that there is no significant difference between CRC and SC in detecting sentinel nodes; however, CRC uses less medical isotopes. In the current climate of critical shortages of medical radioisotopes, <b>radiocolloids</b> should be selected for use based on amount of radioisotope required...|$|R
