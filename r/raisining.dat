5000|$|During the Great Depression <b>raisin</b> prices dropped over 80%. [...] Congress reacted {{by passing}} the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 ("AMAA"). The AMAA allows United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") to issue {{marketing}} orders and agreements holding {{a portion of}} harvests in reserve so as to inflate prices. Authority to determine the annual portion of [...] "reserve tonnage" [...] <b>raisins</b> that are held {{by the government and}} the [...] "free tonnage" [...] <b>raisins</b> that owners may sell on the open market has been delegated by USDA to the <b>Raisin</b> Administrative Committee, a body composed of <b>raisin</b> industry representatives appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture. The <b>raisin</b> reserve often collects nearly half of <b>raisins</b> grown, with the <b>raisin</b> reserve being over 30% of total <b>raisins</b> for six out of the last ten years. The <b>Raisin</b> Committee then sells the reserve <b>raisins</b> on noncompetitive markets for a variety of public purposes such as increasing exports, rewarding favored foreign governments, feeding schoolchildren, or even giving the reserve <b>raisins</b> back to growers if they agree to cut back their production. Sale proceeds that remain after funding <b>Raisin</b> Committee operations and subsidizing exporters are given to the owner of the <b>raisins.</b> This amount is often zero.|$|R
50|$|The California <b>Raisin</b> Advisory Board (or CALRAB) was a California state {{marketing}} commission {{based in}} Fresno, California {{that was created}} in the mid-1900s to coordinate the regulation and promotion of the state's <b>raisin</b> crop. The group became most noted from 1986 to 1994 for developing an international advertising campaign using The California <b>Raisins</b> claymation characters. The California <b>Raisin</b> campaign was funded by an initial grant of US$3 million from the United States Department of Agriculture. Although popular with the public, the California <b>Raisin</b> campaign eventually failed because its production cost the <b>raisin</b> growers almost twice their earnings. CALRAB was closed on July 31, 1994 due to disagreements with <b>raisin</b> producers over the fairness of required payments to the organization. In 1998, the California <b>Raisin</b> Marketing Board, funded by <b>raisin</b> growers, was established to replace CALRAB as the promotional organization for the <b>raisin</b> crop.|$|R

40|$|The {{rheological}} properties of beds of Sun-dried Sultana and Corinth <b>raisins</b> equilibrated to various moisture levels were investigated. <b>Raisin</b> beds of fixed bulk density at various configurations were compressed in a cylindrical test cell, and the apparent modulus {{and the two}} constants of an empirical model were estimated from the linearized stress/strain and relaxation curves. Beds of black Corinth <b>raisins</b> were more elastic than Sultana (seedless) <b>raisins</b> at moistures lower than 18 %, but both types of <b>raisins</b> showed similar rheological behavior at higher moistures. The unrelaxed stress of all beds, after 10 min of relaxation, was about 25 % of the initial stress. Beds of randomly mixed <b>raisins</b> of different moisture content appeared to be more elastic when {{the proportion of the}} moist <b>raisins</b> was increased. The apparent modulus of columns of <b>raisins</b> decreased as the number of <b>raisins</b> per column and the number of adjoining rows were increased...|$|R

50|$|Marvin Horne, a <b>raisin</b> grower {{operating}} outside Kerman, California, did {{not want}} to give any of his <b>raisins</b> to the <b>Raisin</b> Committee. Because the <b>raisin</b> reserve is not collected from growers but from the <b>raisin</b> handlers who sell <b>raisins</b> directly to buyers, Horne restructured his farm to act as both a grower and a handler. He then contended that the reserve requirement no longer applied to him. However, the <b>Raisin</b> Committee disagreed. When the Committee sent its trucks to collect Horne’s <b>raisins</b> Horne refused to allow them onto his property. The Committee then fined Horne $680,000, the value of the <b>raisins</b> plus a penalty. Horne then filed suit in federal court, complaining that the <b>raisin</b> reserve violated the U.S. Constitution. Unconvinced, Fresno federal district Judge Lawrence Joseph O'Neill granted summary judgment to the United States Department of Agriculture. Horne appealed, but a panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that the district court did not even have jurisdiction to hear the constitutional claim. Horne petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, which was granted. Former Tenth Circuit Judge and Stanford Law Professor Michael McConnell argued before the Court on behalf of Horne.|$|R

40|$|<b>Raisins</b> are an {{important}} export commodity for Afghanistan, however, Afghan packers are challenged to export to markets seeking high quality products due to limited knowledge regarding their quality and safety. To evaluate this, Afghan <b>raisin</b> samples from pre-, semi-, and post-processed <b>raisins</b> were obtained from a <b>raisin</b> packer in Kabul, Afghanistan. The <b>raisins</b> were analyzed and compared to U. S. standards for processed <b>raisins.</b> The samples tested did not meet U. S. import standards for embedded sand, but the process used to clean the <b>raisins</b> is suitable to maintain food safety standards. ^ Previous Afghan <b>raisin</b> shipments have been rejected from the U. S. due to too high levels of internal and external sugar crystals, and pesticide residues. Based on the likelihood of export shipment rejection, the thesis examines the quality improvement options available to packers in the short and long-term. To produce <b>raisins</b> compliant with U. S and international Codex standards, packers will need a long-term (3 ̆e 10 year) commitment to improve their own knowledge and establish raw material traceability/ quality improvements from growers. ...|$|R
