6000|$|Mary's china blue eyes, {{more serious}} and more {{astonished}} than ever, were fixed on Mr. Scogan. [...] "Bottles?" [...] she said. [...] "Do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> Bottles..." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>really</b> wouldn't <b>think</b> quite <b>so</b> much if I were you," [...] said Ma kindly. [...] "It must {{be hard on}} you. Won't {{you stay}} and have tea with us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay, and yours, Felix! I do--I {{do want to}} be a help, and not a drag to you. I <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>so</b> much of any of them--not even Lance--as of you. I hope I shouldn't {{have been}} better to my father than I have been to you; and when--when I'm out there, I do hope to show--that I do care.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It isn't true,' cried Ursula. 'Why {{must you}} always praise the past, {{at the expense}} of the present? <b>REALLY,</b> I don't <b>think</b> <b>so</b> much of Jane Austen's England. It was materialistic enough, if you like--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> But flattery {{used not to}} be one of your sins. Ah, I {{wish you}} could give me some advice about how I am to teach them." ...|$|E
6000|$|BROADBENT [delighted]. I hope so. I think so. [Fluctuating] You <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> You {{are sure}} you are not {{allowing}} your enthusiasm for our principles to {{get the better of}} your judgment? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Think! That you {{are very}} likely to succeed,' replied Mr. Pickwick, {{with one of his}} beaming smiles. 'Ah!' said Mr. Magnus. 'But do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Mr. Pickwick? Do you, though?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very," [...] said Mr Watkins, {{though he}} <b>really</b> did not <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> and, feeling the {{conversation}} was drifting a little beyond his grasp, added, [...] "I came down here to paint Hammerpond House by moonlight." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lady Eustace, in the meantime, and Mrs. Carbuncle, with Lord George, {{had found}} their way to the shelter of a cattle-shed. Lucinda had slowly {{followed}}, and Sir Griffin had followed her. The gentlemen smoked cigars, and the ladies, when they had eaten their luncheons and drank their sherry, were cold and cross. [...] "If this is hunting," [...] said Lizzie, [...] "I <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>so</b> much about it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... ii) Lack of information: {{large scale}} social {{experiments}} cannot increase {{our knowledge of}} the social process because as power is centralised to enable theories to put into practice, dissent must be repressed, and so it is harder and harder to find out what people <b>really</b> <b>think,</b> and <b>so</b> whether the utopian experiment is working properly. This assumes that a dictator in such a position could be benevolent and not corrupted by the accumulation of power, which may be doubted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> uncle? I'm so glad! Papa taught me, and I {{read for}} hours to him, but I thought perhaps, {{he liked it}} because he was fond of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Odd!--queer!--why, do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> We are {{not very}} prudish, to be sure, here in the South--do pretty much as we please--enjoy life, and {{all that sort of}} thing, you know-" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Mr. Crosby? And {{would you}} have been afraid to leave your cabin--or are you joking? You know I {{never know when you}} are. It is very dreadful, either way." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{walked slowly}} {{back towards the}} site in deep thought. His {{instinct}} told him that what the agent had said was true. A cheap site. And {{the beauty of it}} was, that he knew the agent did not <b>really</b> <b>think</b> it cheap; <b>so</b> that his own intuitive knowledge was a victory over the agent's.|$|R

Not that I can keep up my attention for very long {{so as to make}} it profitable, but even then it is delightful, only I must go over it again, and so it is perhaps time wasted.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{not till}} 1762, when Johnson was fifty-three years old, that his {{literary}} labors were rewarded {{in the usual}} way by royalty, and he received from George III a yearly pension of three hundred pounds. Then began a little sunshine in his life. With Joshua Reynolds, the artist, he founded the famous Literary Club, of which Burke, Pitt, Fox, Gibbon, Goldsmith, and indeed all the great literary men and politicians of the time, were members. This is the period of Johnson's famous conversations, which were caught in minutest detail by Boswell and given to the world. His idea of conversation, as shown in a hundred places in Boswell, is to overcome your adversary at any cost; to knock him down by arguments, or, when these fail, by personal ridicule; to dogmatize on every possible question, pronounce a few oracles, and then desist with the air of victory. Concerning the philosopher Hume's view of death he says: [...] "Sir, if he <b>really</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>so,</b> his perceptions are disturbed, he is mad. If he does not <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> he lies." [...] Exit opposition. There is nothing more to be said. Curiously enough, it is often the palpable blunders of these monologues that now attract us, {{as if we were}} enjoying a good joke at the dictator's expense. Once a lady asked him, [...] "Dr. Johnson, why did you define pastern as the knee of a horse?" [...] "Ignorance, madame, pure ignorance," [...] thundered the great authority.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Bromfield?" [...] asked Mrs. Corey, taking courage a little. [...] "That might do," [...] But her spirits visibly sank again. [...] "I don't {{know any}} other girl half so pretty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I think so; but I don't {{know that}} I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> That's another matter," [...] said Mrs. Brinkley, with the {{whimsical}} resentment which Miss Cotton's conscientious pursuit seemed always to rouse in her.|$|E
60|$|UNDERSHAFT. Do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> He has induced us {{to bring}} him into the world; but he chose his parents very incongruously, I think. I see nothing of myself in him, and less of you.|$|E
6000|$|The doctor reflected. [...] "Is it?" [...] he said. [...] "Perhaps you may {{be right}} again. I think it's only indifference, myself. Curiously enough my brother looks at it from your point of view--he even used the same word that you used just now. I suppose he found my cynicism beyond the reach of reform. At any rate, he left off coming here. I got rid of him on easy terms. What do you say? That inhuman way of talking is unworthy of me? <b>Really</b> I don't <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> I'm not a downright savage. It's only indifference." ...|$|R
5000|$|In February 2015, British {{actor and}} Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne {{revealed}} to a journalist from Elle UK magazine {{that he uses}} the work of Karl and Susan as acting inspiration. He said [...] "Watch, and you'll find that everything they do is on another level of genius. I <b>really</b> do <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> They are the greatest unsung acting duo in history." [...] Redmayne later told News.com.au he is {{a huge fan of}} the couple and that he learned a lot from them when he used to watch Neighbours daily. Both Fletcher and Woodburne responded to Redmayne's comments. Fletcher said, [...] "To receive such generous praise from an actor of Eddie Redmayne's startling ability and status has been thrilling for both of us. It never ceases to excite me to hear examples of the influence Neighbours has had beyond Australia." [...] Woodburne added, [...] "It's always wonderful when someone compliments your work, but to have such lovely things said from such an incredibly talented actor is very humbling and means more to me than he will ever know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not here!" [...] entreated Eustace, {{alarmed at}} his gesture. [...] "Remember the servant. Oh Harold, {{if you could}} but be more the gentleman! Why cannot you take example by me, instead of overthrowing all the {{advantageous}} impressions that such--such a service has created? I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> there's nothing he would not do for me. Don't you <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Lucy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Captain Cuffe?--Now, to my notion, {{this day}} hasn't had its equal on the Proserpine's log, since we {{got hold of}} l'Epervier and her convoy. You forget, sir, that we {{destroyed}} le Feu-Follet last night!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do {{you think}} they will not?' said Phoebe, with slower and graver steps. 'Do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> But no! It can't lead to coming out; and I know they like me to be happy when it interferes with nobody.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Finsbury?" [...] responded the magistrate, {{leaning back}} in his cushions, delighted with the compliment. [...] "Yes, I suppose I am a nuisance. But, mind you, I have a stake in the country: don't forget that, dear boy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>so</b> either," [...] Frank agreed, [...] "or I {{would try}} and swim back again; but I <b>really</b> don't <b>think</b> I could get round the point against the tide again." ...|$|R
50|$|Abhilasha, the model, {{comes to}} him a little while later, it seems both their fathers are {{childhood}} friends, and her father now wants to meet JoMo. He gets a slight hint from her {{that this may be}} a marriage proposal. She tells that she would take him to her house two days later. JoMo is joyous! When he reaches home Kitta (who had been to Bangalore on his business tour) is back. Kitta has apparently fallen in love with a police officer in Bangalore, and has decided to marry her. He says that Kasturi (the police woman) will be visiting Chennai very soon. When JoMo tells everyone about Abhilasha, they all think that the possibility of a beautiful model marrying him is <b>really</b> lean. JoMo <b>thinks</b> <b>so</b> too, but he hopes all of them are wrong.|$|R
60|$|I think, as Mrs. Micawber sat at {{the back}} of the coach, with the children, and I stood in the road looking wistfully at them, a mist cleared from her eyes, and she saw what a little {{creature}} I <b>really</b> was. I <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> because she beckoned to me to climb up, with quite a new and motherly expression in her face, and put her arm round my neck, and gave me just such a kiss as she might have given to her own boy. I had barely time to get down again before the coach started, and I could hardly see the family for the handkerchiefs they waved. It was gone in a minute. The Orfling and I stood looking vacantly at each other in the middle of the road, and then shook hands and said good-bye; she going back, I suppose, to St. Luke's workhouse, as I went to begin my weary day at Murdstone and Grinby's.|$|R
6000|$|... "What! Then my wretched {{attempt to}} have Marmaduke warned was useless. Oh, Nelly, {{this is too}} bad. Do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> When I told him before dinner what Mrs. Leith Fairfax wrote, he only said he feared it was true, and refused {{to give me the}} address." ...|$|E
60|$|The most effectual {{consolation}} that I could invent for Cecile {{was that}} if her husband thought me bad company for her, he could not but fetch her to her proper home with him, as soon as peace was made. Did I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> The little thing grew radiant with the hope.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh! Craigengelt?" [...] said Bucklaw, [...] "do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>so?</b> but no, no! he is a devilish deal prettier {{man than}} I am." [...] "Who--he?" [...] exclaimed the parasite. [...] "He's {{as black as}} the crook; and for his size--he's a tall fellow, to be sure, but give me a light, stout, middle-sized----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you <b>really</b> <b>think,</b> Rupert,' she asked, as if Ursula {{were not}} present, 'do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> {{it is worth}} while? Do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> the {{children}} are better for being roused to consciousness?' ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{sight of}} her lying there so deadly white taxed Leila's nerves severely. But the girl revived quickly, and a cab was sent for. Leila went with her, and told the driver to stop at Camelot Mansions. Why take her home in this state, why not save the jolting, and let her recover properly? They went upstairs arm in arm. Leila made her {{lie down on the}} divan, and put a hot-water bottle to her feet. Noel was still so passive and pale that even to speak to her seemed a cruelty. And, going to her little sideboard, Leila stealthily {{extracted}} a pint bottle of some champagne which Jimmy Fort had sent in, and took it with two glasses and a corkscrew into her bedroom. She drank a little herself, and came out bearing a glass to the girl. Noel shook her head, and her eyes seemed to say: [...] "Do you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> I'm <b>so</b> easily mended?" [...] But Leila had been through too much in her time to despise earthly remedies, and she held it to the girl's lips until she drank. It was excellent champagne, and, since Noel had never yet touched alcohol, had an instantaneous effect. Her eyes brightened; little red spots came up in her cheeks. And suddenly she rolled over and buried her face deep in a cushion. With her short hair, she looked so like a child lying there, that Leila knelt down, stroking her head, and saying: [...] "There, there; my love! There, there!" ...|$|R
5000|$|On December 26, 2012, MPD spokesmen {{confirmed}} {{the launch of}} an inquiry. [...] When asked by CNN on December 27, 2012, if he thought Gregory should be prosecuted, NRA president David Keene responded, [...] "No, I don't <b>think</b> <b>so...</b> I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> what David Gregory did while he was inadvertently flouting the law was illustrating in a very graphic way, perhaps not intentionally, but in a graphic way just how silly some of these laws are." [...] Other gun rights advocates argued that not charging Gregory would show D.C. police to be hypocritical in enforcing gun laws.|$|R
