5|$|Arsenal {{continued}} to dominate possession once {{the second half}} got underway, but struggled {{to use it to}} their advantage. Lauren's cross from the <b>right</b> <b>was</b> cleared away by the United defence and Henry moments later miscued his effort aimed at goal. Moments later Ljungberg beat his marker and crossed the ball into the penalty area, only for Bergkamp to drag his shot wide. United threatened once the game reached the hour mark, winning duels and earning set-pieces. Gabriel Heinze's shot from about 20 yards tested Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in the 65th minute. Five minutes later Wenger substituted Reyes off in place of Pirès.|$|E
5|$|Despite such inaccuracies, {{the tale}} has been {{frequently}} repeated.

5|$|In early afternoon, Beauregard {{launched}} {{a series of}} counterattacks from the Shiloh Church area, aiming to control the Corinth Road. The Union <b>right</b> <b>was</b> temporarily driven back by these assaults at Water Oaks Pond. Crittenden, reinforced by Tuttle, seized the junction of the Hamburg-Purdy and East Corinth roads, driving the Confederates into Prentiss's old camps. Nelson resumed his attack and seized the heights overlooking Locust Grove Branch by late afternoon. Beauregard's final counterattack was flanked and repulsed when Grant moved Col. James C. Veatch's brigade forward.|$|E
5|$|In response, the House of Commons {{prepared}} {{a set of}} four Resolutions, decrying these actions and restating the validity of Magna Carta and the legal requirement of habeas corpus. These were rejected by Charles, who also announced that Parliament would be dissolved; in response, the Commons met on 6 May to discuss alternatives, and concluded that a petition of <b>right</b> <b>was</b> the way forward. Accordingly, a committee under Sir Edward Coke drafted such a petition, and it {{was passed by the}} Commons on 8 May and sent to the House of Lords. After three weeks of debates and conferences between the two chambers, the Petition of <b>Right</b> <b>was</b> ratified by both houses on the 26th and 27 May. Following additional debates in which the King restricted the right of the Commons to freely speak, he bowed to the pressure; in need of Parliamentary support for the war effort, the Petition was accepted on 2 June. Unhappy with the method chosen, both houses joined together and demanded the King fully ratify the Petition, which he did on 7 June.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} these steps toward equal treatment, a legal flaw remained: if {{children}} were born within a lesbian marriage, the non-biological mother was not legally regarded as a parent; she still had to undergo the lengthy financial process of adoption. This <b>right</b> <b>was</b> granted to heterosexual couples (married or not), where a stepfather could declare his wife's children to be his without further process. On 7 November 2006, the Spanish Parliament amended the law on assisted reproduction, allowing the non-biological mother {{to be regarded as}} a parent alongside her female spouse who is the birth-mother.|$|E

5|$|In {{the initial}} {{years after the}} conquest of Granada, Muslims in Granada and {{elsewhere}} continued to enjoy freedom of religion. This <b>right</b> <b>was</b> guaranteed in various legal instruments, including treaties, charters, capitulations, and coronation oaths. For example, the Treaty of Granada (1491) guaranteed religious tolerance to the Muslims of the conquered Granada. Kings of Aragon, including King Ferdinand II and Charles V, swore to protect the Muslims' religious freedom in their oaths of coronation.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{attempting}} a frontal {{assault on the}} strongly entrenched Ottoman positions, the two divisions of the XX Corps were {{to carry out a}} converging movement. The 10th Division on the left of the main road was to capture Nablus, while the 53rd Division on the <b>right</b> <b>was</b> to move east of Nablus along a watershed to cut the lines of retreat from the Judean Hills to the Jisr ed Damieh and converge on Nablus.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Taylor overshot Castaway Cay and instead reached another land mass in southern Abaco Island. He then proceeded northwest as planned. He fully expected to find the Grand Bahama Island lying {{in front of him}} as expected. Instead, he eventually saw a land mass to his right side, the northern part of Abaco Island. Believing that this landmass to his <b>right</b> <b>was</b> the Grand Bahama Island and his compass was malfunctioning, he set a course to what he thought was southwest to head straight back to Fort Lauderdale. However, in reality this changed his course farther northwest, toward open ocean.|$|E
40|$|Stephen May (2011) {{holds that}} {{language}} <b>rights</b> have <b>been</b> insufficiently recognized, or just rejected as problematic, {{in human rights}} theory and practice. Defending the “human rights approach to language rights”, he claims that language <b>rights</b> should <b>be</b> accorded the status of fundamental human rights, recognized as such by states and international organizations. This article argues {{that the notion of}} language <b>rights</b> <b>is</b> far from clear. According to May, one key reason for rejecting the claim that language <b>rights</b> should <b>be</b> considered as human <b>rights</b> <b>is</b> the widespread belief that language <b>rights</b> <b>are</b> collective <b>rights.</b> In order to address this kind of objection, the collective character attributed to language <b>rights</b> must <b>be</b> carefully assessed, distinguishing two different views of what a collective <b>right</b> <b>is...</b>|$|R

5|$|The French army {{formed on}} the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the <b>right</b> <b>was</b> I Corps under d'Erlon with 16,000 {{infantry}} and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under Reille with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn La Belle Alliance were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the Imperial Guard, and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial line formed up on {{a similar}} ridge facing the French position. On the far left, facing Des Thermes, were 300 Florentine light cavalry under Rodolfo Baglioni; {{flanking}} them to the right were 6,000 Italian infantry under Ferrante Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno. In the center were the 7,000 landsknechte {{under the command of}} Eriprando Madruzzo. To their <b>right</b> <b>was</b> d'Avalos himself, together with the small force of about 200 heavy cavalry under Carlo Gonzaga. The Imperial right wing was composed of around 5,000 German and Spanish infantry under Ramón de Cardona; they were flanked, on the far right, by 300 Italian light cavalry under Philip de Lannoy, Prince of Sulmona.|$|E
5|$|The Maratha {{army was}} {{a mix of}} Rohillas, Rajputs, and Marathas. It also {{included}} a small force of the Portuguese under their officer, de Pinto. The left flank of the Maratha army, commanded by Moropant Dixit and Raste, was stationed on the flat ground on which the University of Pune stands today. The centre was commanded by Bapu Gokhale and the <b>right</b> <b>was</b> under Vinchurkar. British troop movements began on 1 November 1817 when Colonel Burr moved his forces towards what is now Bund Garden via the Holkar Bridge. The Maratha were successful initially in creating and exploiting {{a gap in the}} British left and centre. These successes were nullified by the Maratha horses being thrown into disarray by a hidden canal and the temporary loss of command by Gokhale, whose horse was shot. The Marathas were rendered leaderless when Moropant Dixit on the <b>right</b> <b>was</b> shot dead. The British infantry advanced steadily, firing volley after volley, causing the Maratha cavalry to retreat in a matter of four hours. The British soon claimed victory. The British lost 86 men and the Maratha about 500.|$|E
