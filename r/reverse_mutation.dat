25|$|Finding a {{cure for}} the {{diseases}} caused by frameshift mutations is rare. Research into this is evident. One example is a primary immunodeficiency (PID), an inherited condition {{which can lead to}} an increase in infections. There are 120 genes and 150 mutations that play a role in primary immunodeficiencies. The standard treatment is currently gene therapy, but this is a highly risky treatment and can often lead to other diseases, such as leukemia. Gene therapy procedures include modifying the zinc fringer nuclease fustion protein, cleaving both ends of the mutation, which in turn removes it from the sequence. Antisense-oligonucleotide mediated exon skipping is another possibility for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This process allows for passing over the mutation so {{that the rest of the}} sequence remains in frame and the function of the protein stays intact. This, however, does not cure the disease, just treats symptoms, and is only practical in structural proteins or other repetitive genes. A third form of repair is revertant mosaicism, which is naturally occurring by creating a <b>reverse</b> <b>mutation</b> or a mutation at a second site that corrects the reading frame. This reversion may happen by intragenic recombination, mitotic gene conversion, second site DNA slipping or site-specific reversion. This is possible in several diseases, such as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome, and Bloom syndrome. There are no drugs or other pharmacogenomic methods that help with PIDs.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Aiming {{to answer}} the broad {{question}} "When does mutation occur?" {{this study examined the}} time of appearance, dominance, and completeness of in vivo Gag mutations in primary HIV- 1 subtype C infection. METHODS: A primary HIV- 1 C infection cohort comprised of 8 acutely and 34 recently infected subjects were followed frequently up to 500 days post-seroconversion (p/s). Gag mutations were analyzed by employing single-genome amplification and direct sequencing. Gag mutations were determined in relation to the estimated time of seroconversion. Time of appearance, dominance, and completeness was compared for different types of in vivo Gag <b>mutations.</b> RESULTS: <b>Reverse</b> <b>mutations</b> to the wild type appeared at a median (IQR) of 62 (44; 139) days p/s, while escape mutations from the wild type appeared at 234 (169; 326) days p/s (p< 0. 001). Within the subset of mutations that became dominant, <b>reverse</b> and escape <b>mutations</b> appeared at 54 (30; 78) days p/s and 104 (47; 198) days p/s, respectively (p< 0. 001). Among the mutations that reached completeness, <b>reverse</b> and escape <b>mutations</b> appeared at 54 (30; 78) days p/s and 90 (44; 196) days p/s, respectively (p= 0. 006). Time of dominance for <b>reverse</b> <b>mutations</b> to and escape mutations from the wild type was 58 (44; 105) days p/s and 219 (90; 326) days p/s, respectively (p< 0. 001). Time of completeness for <b>reverse</b> and escape <b>mutations</b> was 152 (100; 176) days p/s and 243 (101; 370) days p/s, respectively (p= 0. 001). Fitting a Cox proportional hazards model with frailties confirmed a significantly earlier time of appearance (hazard ratio (HR) : 2. 6; 95 % CI: 2. 3 - 3. 0), dominance (4. 8 (3. 4 - 6. 8)), and completeness (3. 6 (2. 3 - 5. 5)) of <b>reverse</b> <b>mutations</b> to the wild type Gag than escape mutations from the wild type. Some complex mutational pathways in Gag included sequential series of reversions and escapes. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified the timing of different types of in vivo Gag mutations in primary HIV- 1 subtype C infection in relation to the estimated time of seroconversion. Overall, the in vivo <b>reverse</b> <b>mutations</b> to the wild type occurred significantly earlier than escape mutations from the wild type. This shorter time to incidence of <b>reverse</b> <b>mutations</b> remained in the subsets of in vivo Gag mutations that reached dominance or completeness...|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} {{biological}} processes {{that help to}} prevent frameshift <b>mutations.</b> <b>Reverse</b> <b>mutations</b> occur which change the mutated sequence {{back to the original}} wild type sequence. Another possibility for mutation correction is the use of a suppressor mutation. This offsets the effect of the original mutation by creating a secondary mutation, shifting the sequence to allow for the correct amino acids to be read.

5000|$|The Ames {{test was}} {{initially}} developed using agar plates (the plate incorporation technique), as described above. Since that time, a popular alternative to performing the Ames test has been developed, {{which is known}} as the [...] "fluctuation method". This technique is the same in concept as the agar-based method, with bacteria being added to a reaction mixture {{with a small amount of}} histidine, which allows the bacteria to grow and mutate, returning to synthesize their own histidine. By including a pH indicator, the frequency of mutation is counted in microplates as the number of wells which have changed color (caused by a drop in pH due to metabolic processes of reproducing bacteria). As with the traditional Ames test, the sample is compared to the natural background rate of <b>reverse</b> <b>mutation</b> in order to establish the genotoxicity of a substance.The fluctuation method is performed entirely in liquid culture and is scored by counting the number of wells that turn yellow from purple in 96-well or 384-well microplates. [...] In the 96-well plate method the frequency of mutation is counted as the number of wells out of 96 which have changed color. The plates are incubated for up to five days, with mutated (yellow) colonies being counted each day and compared to the background rate of <b>reverse</b> <b>mutation</b> using established tables of significance to determine the significant differences between the background rate of mutation and that for the tested samples.|$|E
50|$|Toxicology {{studies were}} {{conducted}} by use of animal models, utilizing a variety of species, including mice, rats, and monkeys. Singles doses in rats and monkeys were given up to 30,000 and 50,000 micrograms/kg, respectively. Daily doses of 1,000 and 300 micrograms/kg, respectively, were given to rats and monkeys for 28 consecutive days. Toxic effects noted included exaggerated pharmacological effects of the drug, such as hyperkeratosis of skin and tongue and goblet cell hyperplasia in the GI tract. It was noted that the rats were more sensitive to these effects than the monkeys. Induced genetic abnormality assays including microchromosome <b>reverse</b> <b>mutation</b> and E. coli mutagenicity assays were completed using mice.

5000|$|Certain {{mutations}} {{occur with}} measurable and consistent frequencies. Deleterious and neutral alleles can increase in frequency if the mutation rate to this phenotype is sufficiently {{higher than the}} <b>reverse</b> <b>mutation</b> rate, however {{this appears to be}} rare. Beyond creating new variation for selection to act upon mutations plays a primary role in evolution when mutations in one direction are [...] "weeded out by natural selection" [...] and mutations in the other direction are neutral. This is purify selection when it acts to maintain functionally important characters but also results in the loss or diminished size of useless organs as the functional constraint is lifted. An example of this is the diminished size of the Y chromosome in mammals and this can be attributed to recurrent mutations and recurrent evolution.|$|E

By <b>reversing</b> <b>mutations</b> that accumulated in an α-proteobacterial PhoR, we demonstrate that these substitutions were adaptive, enabling PhoR to avoid crosstalk with a paralogous pathway that arose specifically in α-proteobacteria. Our findings demonstrate that duplication and the subsequent need to avoid crosstalk strongly influence signaling protein evolution. These results provide a concrete example of how system-wide insulation can be achieved postduplication through a surprisingly limited number of mutations.

The platinum co-ordination complex cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) ] is a highly effective anticancer drug whose activity derives from its ability to form adducts crosslinking neighbouring purine bases in DNA. Under in vitro conditions, cisplatin induced cellular inactivation, forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>mutations,</b> reciprocal and nonreciprocal mitotic recombinations and phenotypic switching in the opportunistically pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. Mutant and recombinant yields were higher with post-treatment growth at 25 degrees C rather than 37 degrees C: the reverse was true for cell death or phenotypic switches. These responses comport with prior evidence that, generally, the higher recovery temperature discourages DNA repair processes in C. albicans. Thiosulphate, an agent used therapeutically to reduce nephrotoxic side effects of cisplatin in humans, greatly decreased both the lethality and recombinagenicity of cisplatin for C. albicans. Implications of these observations for possible genetic destabilization of C. albicans populations born naturally by cancer patients undergoing treatments with cisplatin are discussed. peer reviewe...|$|R
