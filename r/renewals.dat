5|$|Soon after Cleveland's {{return to}} office, hard times struck {{the nation with}} the Panic of 1893. A {{businessman}} in Youngstown, Robert Walker, had lent money to McKinley in their younger days; in gratitude, McKinley had often guaranteed Walker's borrowings for his business. The governor had never kept track {{of what he was}} signing; he believed Walker a sound businessman. In fact, Walker had deceived McKinley, telling him that new notes were actually <b>renewals</b> of matured ones. Walker was ruined by the recession; McKinley was called upon for repayment in February 1893. The total owed was over $100,000 and a despairing McKinley initially proposed to resign as governor and earn the money as an attorney. Instead, McKinley's wealthy supporters, including Hanna and Chicago publisher H. H. Kohlsaat, became trustees of a fund from which the notes would be paid. Both William and Ida McKinley placed their property {{in the hands of the}} fund's trustees (who included Hanna and Kohlsaat), and the supporters raised and contributed a substantial sum of money. All of the couple's property was returned to them by the end of 1893, and when McKinley, who had promised eventual repayment, asked for the list of contributors, it was refused him. Many people who had suffered in the hard times sympathized with McKinley, whose popularity grew. He was easily re-elected in November 1893, receiving the largest percentage of the vote of any Ohio governor since the Civil War.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis of}} this study is that <b>renewal</b> efforts {{characterized}} by a partnership between empowering leadership and an engaged grassroots will, over time, experience a greater degree of <b>renewal</b> than organizations whose <b>renewal</b> efforts are initiated and driven exclusively at the executive level. Further conclusions are that <b>renewal</b> efforts must be a custom job, expansion probably works best when preceded by <b>renewal,</b> and organizations must confront and deal with the problem of escalating commitments. The thesis examines the dimensions of organizational <b>renewal</b> in religious organizations with respect to regional jurisdictions and establishes the criteria for measuring <b>renewal.</b> <b>Renewal</b> is defined as a change in structure, culture, standards or norms without altering the fundamental purpose and identity of an organization. <b>Renewal</b> can also mean whatever it takes to preserve or regain the health and vitality of an organization as opposed to allowing the organization to grow stagnant, unproductive, and die of entropy. Changes that are made by an organization to allow it to return to its raison d'être demonstrate the qualities of organizational <b>renewal</b> as defined in this project. The literature for both management and religious organizations reveals an absence of material addressing <b>renewal</b> in terms of initiating a planned change. Further, religious organizations are bereft of material focused on <b>renewal</b> at the level of regional jurisdictions. The two notable exceptions to the above are Hurst (1995) and Payne and Beazley (2000) whose material is reviewed at length. Three case studies provide the laboratory in which the model of <b>renewal</b> is tested. A series of interviews and examination of documents from two North American districts in the Church of the Nazarene give examples of <b>renewal</b> efforts. These case studies are compared and contrasted with an analysis of the secondary literature on the Dutch Catholic <b>renewal</b> in the 1960 's...|$|R
