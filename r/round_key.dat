25|$|In {{the most}} basic form of key {{recovery}} through differential cryptanalysis, an attacker requests the ciphertexts for {{a large number of}} plaintext pairs, then assumes that the differential holds for at least r − 1 rounds, where r is the total number of rounds. The attacker then deduces which round keys (for the final round) are possible, assuming the difference between the blocks before the final round is fixed. When round keys are short, this can be achieved by simply exhaustively decrypting the ciphertext pairs one round with each possible <b>round</b> <b>key.</b> When one <b>round</b> <b>key</b> has been deemed a potential <b>round</b> <b>key</b> considerably more often than any other key, it is assumed to be the correct <b>round</b> <b>key.</b>|$|E

[...] After studying this waahoo there were boatmen and fishermen at Long Key who believed they had seen schools of them. Mr. Schutt had observed schools of them on the reef, low down near the coral--fish that would run from forty to one hundred pounds. It made me thrill just to think of hooking a waahoo weighing anywhere near a hundred pounds. Mr. Shannon testified that he had once observed a school of waahoo leaping in the Gulf Stream--all very large fish. And once, on a clear, still day, I drifted over a bunch of big, sharp-nosed, game-looking fish that I am sure belonged to this species.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{implementation}} of code based cryptography (Cryptocoding) technique for multi-layer key distribution scheme is presented. VLSI chip {{is designed for}} storing information on generation of <b>round</b> <b>keys.</b> New algorithm is developed for reduced key size with optimal performance. Error Control Algorithm is employed for both generation of <b>round</b> <b>keys</b> and diffusion of non-linearity among them. Two new functions for bit inversion and its reversal are developed for cryptocoding. Probability of retrieving original key from any other <b>round</b> <b>keys</b> is reduced by diffusing nonlinear selective bit inversions on <b>round</b> <b>keys.</b> Randomized selective bit inversions are done on equal length of <b>key</b> bits by <b>Round</b> Constant Feedback Shift Register within the error correction limits of chosen code. Complexity of retrieving the original key from any other <b>round</b> <b>keys</b> is increased by optimal hardware usage. Proposed design is simulated and synthesized using VHDL coding for Spartan 3 E FPGA and results are shown. Comparative analysis is done between 128 bit Advanced Encryption Standard <b>round</b> <b>keys</b> and proposed <b>round</b> <b>keys</b> for showing security strength of proposed algorithm. This paper concludes that chip based multi-layer key distribution of proposed algorithm is an enhanced solution to the existing threats on cryptography algorithms...|$|R
