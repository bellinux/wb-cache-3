40|$|Allocation of {{environmental}} cleanup costs among <b>responsible</b> <b>parties</b> {{is a key}} component of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as Superfund. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has expressly acknowledged its importance and twice within the past three terms has grappled with how <b>responsible</b> <b>parties</b> may bring CERCLA claims, for contribution or otherwise, to force other <b>responsible</b> <b>parties</b> to share responsibility for cleanup costs at contaminated sites. While some questions remain to be answered around the edges, it is once again fairly clear that a <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> who is subject to joint and several liability for cleanup costs has a statutory claim under CERCLA by which he can require other <b>responsible</b> <b>parties</b> to bear their equitable shares of the cleanup burden. Thus, because a CERCLA defendant can bring actions for contribution or cost recovery, he may not have to shoulder the entire cleanup burden himself, while other <b>responsible</b> <b>parties</b> avoid liability entirely, just because he had the misfortune of being the one <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> sued. In addition to providing a whiff of fairness in the Superfund program, the availability of contribution and cost recovery claims by <b>responsible</b> <b>parties</b> is widely credited with promoting settlements and encouraging cleanups of contaminated sites by private parties while preserving governmental resources. The 2 ̆ 2 imminent hazard 2 ̆ 2 provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), like CERCLA, are used to force <b>responsible</b> <b>parties</b> to bear the costs of cleaning up contaminated sites. Sections 7003 and 7002 (a) (1) (B) authorize the United States and citizens, respectively, to require <b>responsible</b> <b>parties</b> to clean up wastes which may present an 2 ̆ 2 imminent and substantial endangerment 2 ̆ 2 to health or the environment. Defendants in RCRA imminent hazard cases, like CERCLA defendants, generally are subject to strict, retroactive and joint and several liability. But unlike in CERCLA cases, virtually without exception courts have ruled that defendants in RCRA imminent hazard cases do not have a claim under RCRA, for contribution or otherwise, by which they can seek to force other <b>responsible</b> <b>parties</b> to share the cleanup responsibility...|$|R

50|$|Under the Oil Pollution Act, federal, tribal, state, and {{any other}} person can recover removal costs from a <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> so long as such entity has {{incurred}} costs from carrying out oil removal activities {{in accordance with the}} Clean Water Act National Contingency Plan. Reimbursement claims must first be made to the <b>responsible</b> <b>party.</b> If the potentially <b>responsible</b> <b>party</b> refutes liability or fails to distribute the reimbursement within 90 days of the claim, the claimant may file suit in court or bring the claim to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund described below. In some instances, claims for removal cost reimbursement can be initially brought to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund thus sidestepping the <b>responsible</b> <b>party.</b> For example, claimants advised by the EPA, governors of affected states, and American claimants for incidents involving foreign vessels or facilities may initially present their claims to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. When claims for removal cost reimbursement are brought to the fund, the claimant must prove that removal costs were sustained from activities required to avoid or alleviate effects of the incident and that such actions were approved or directed by the federal on-scene coordinator.|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} liabilities is a {{noise factor}} of perception in accounting earnings information. This study examines {{the effect of}} environmental liabilirties for earnings reponse coefficients by using the approach of event study. This study was conducted in. Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX). Among 155 firms of manufactures from some kinds of industries that listed in,ISX, were taken 93 firms purposively to become sample. The sample {{were divided into two}} groups, 41 firms are classified as the group of Potentially <b>Responsible</b> <b>Party</b> (PRP) and 52 firms as the group of Non Potentially <b>Responsible</b> <b>Party</b> (non-PRP). Documentation technique was employed together data. Multiple regression and independent sample t-test were used to analyzed data after fidfilling classical and assumptions and test requeirement. The results provide some support for the hypothesis that the earnings response coefficients for Potentially <b>Responsible</b> <b>Party</b> (PRP) firms are lower than the earnings response coefficients for non-Potentially <b>Responsible</b> <b>Party</b> (non-PRP) firms. It is hoped from this research will be able to add our understanding about one of implication offinns environmental liabilities. First, evidence for the relationship between of environmental liabilities information and earnings response coefficients should be useful for investors in taking decision. Second, it also has contribution to enlarge the development of accountancy literature especially study about the factors that influence Earnings Response Coefficients. ...|$|R
