40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{multistage}} 20 m shuttle <b>run</b> <b>test</b> with 1 min stages (Léger et al. 1988) is {{a popular}} field test to predict maximal oxygen uptake (Tomkinson et al. 2000). In this <b>test,</b> subjects <b>run</b> {{back and forth between}} 2 parallel lines, marked 20 m apart, in time to sounds from a compact disc (20 m shuttle <b>run</b> <b>test,</b> Australian Sports Commission). It has been suggested, however, that the changes of speed and direction at each line may negatively influence the out-come of the test (O´Gorman et al. 2000). PURPOSE: We examined the prediction of maximal oxygen uptake by the 20 m shuttle <b>run</b> <b>test</b> by comparing the line to line 20 m shuttle <b>run</b> <b>test</b> (20 MST-LL) with running the 20 m shuttle <b>run</b> <b>test</b> in a figure of 8 (20 MST-Fo 8).

Direct estimation of cardiorespiratory endurance (VO 2 max) comprised treadmill exercise followed by expired gas analysis by scholander micro-gas analyzer whereas VO 2 max was indirectly predicted by the 20 -meter multistage shuttle <b>run</b> <b>test.</b> The difference between the mean (SD) VO 2 max values of direct measurement (VO 2 max = 39. 29 +/- 1. 98 ml/kg/min) and 20 -meter multi stage shuttle <b>run</b> <b>test</b> (SPVO 2 max = 39. 20 +/- 2. 27 ml/kg/min) was statistically insignificant (p > 0. 10). Limits of agreement analysis also suggest that the 20 -m multistage shuttle <b>run</b> <b>test</b> can be applied for use with the studied population. The results suggest that the application of the present form of 20 - meter multistage shuttle <b>run</b> <b>test</b> be justified in the studied population.

40|$|Twelve-minute <b>run</b> <b>test</b> {{developed}} by Cooper in 1968 {{is a popular}} field test to evaluate an individual 2 ̆ 7 s cardiorespiratory fitness. However, the test requires high subject motivation and {{is accompanied by a}} high cardiovascular risk because of its maximal nature. In an attempt to avoid this flaw, this study sought to develop a 12 -min submaximal <b>run</b> <b>test</b> and to validate it as a field test of cardiorespiratory fitness. Twenty-eight men, aged 19 - 34 years (22. 3 ± 3. 6), served as subjects. Individual 2 ̆ 7 s cardiorespiratory fitness was evaluated by the distance covered in 12 minutes at the intensity corresponding to 13 on the Borg 2 ̆ 7 s ratings of perceived exertion (RPE 13). All of the subjects performed a maximal stress test, the 12 -min submaximal <b>run</b> <b>test</b> and the 12 -min maximal <b>run</b> <b>test.</b> VO_ and VO_ of the subjects averaged 57. 9 ± 7. 5 ml/kg/min and 45. 4 ± 8. 0 ml/kg/min, respectively. The distance covered in 12 -min submaximal <b>run</b> <b>test</b> (2758 ± 306 m) was significantly shorter than that covered in 12 -min maximal <b>run</b> <b>test</b> (3105 ± 394 m). Analyses of data indicated that aerobic capacity (VO_ and VO_) significantly correlated with the 12 -min submaximal run (r=O. 85 and O. 86, respectively) and with the 12 -min maximal run (r= 0. 77 and 0. 81, respectively). Although the intensity of the 12 -min submaximal <b>run</b> <b>test</b> was lower, their relationships were higher than that of the 12 -min maximal <b>run</b> <b>test.</b> Our findings suggest that 12 -min submaximal <b>run</b> <b>test</b> is a better cardiorespiratory fitness test than 12 -min maximal <b>run</b> <b>test.</b> Furthermore, we attemped to develop equations to predict VO_ and VO_ using the distance covered in 12 -min submaximal run and age. Multipule regression analyses to predict VO_ and VO_ yielded the following equations: the distance in the 12 -min submaximal run (m) X_ 1 and age (yr) X_ 2. VO_= 0. 0021 X_ 1 (m) - 0. 52 X_ 2 (yr) + 0. 75 (R= 0. 89, SEE= 3. 81 ml/kg/min) VO_= 0. 0019 X_ 1 (m) - 0. 56 X_ 2 (yr) + 17. 93 (R= 0. 89, SEE= 3. 64 ml/kg/min) It was concluded that the distance covered during the 12 -min submaximal run was a highly valid indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness...|$|R

Objective of this research is to determine the association between Body Mass Index (BMI) with cardiovascular fitness in obese children measured by Harvard step test and 20 m Shuttle <b>run</b> <b>test.</b> Method: Cross sectional study was conducted to 31 students of Bernadus Elementary School Semarang in August 2010.

Twenty-one soccer players (21 ± 2 years; 76. 8 ± 7. 0 kg; 179. 8 ± 6. 7 cm) from a first division team of the São Paulo Soccer Federation participated in the study. In the first session, the players were submitted to the Wingate test for the determination of relative peak power output, relative mean power output and fatigue index. In the second session, the players underwent a shuttle <b>run</b> <b>test</b> which consisted of a maximum sprint of 20 m at the highest speed possible until completing a distance of 300 m. The total run time and mean velocity over the 20 m (V 20 m) were recorded.

Pearson’s correlation between the Wingate and 300 -m shuttle <b>run</b> <b>test</b> variables showed that only relative mean power output was significantly correlated with total run time (r = - 0. 75) and V 20 m (r = 0. 72).
