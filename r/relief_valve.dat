25|$|The {{compressor}} {{should be}} provided with an accumulator and a <b>relief</b> <b>valve.</b> The accumulator functions as an additional water trap, but the main purpose {{is to provide a}} reserve volume of pressurised air. The <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> allows any excess air to be released back to the atmosphere while retaining the appropriate supply pressure in the accumulator.|$|E
25|$|With the {{pilot-operated}} <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> still open, the pressurizer {{relief tank}} that collected the {{discharge from the}} pilot-operated <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> overfilled, causing the containment building sump to fill and sound an alarm at 4:11am. This alarm, along with higher than normal temperatures on the pilot-operated <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> discharge line and unusually high containment building temperatures and pressures, were clear indications {{that there was an}} ongoing loss-of-coolant accident, but these indications were initially ignored by operators. At 4:15am, the relief diaphragm of the pressurizer relief tank ruptured, and radioactive coolant began to leak out into the general containment building. This radioactive coolant was pumped from the containment building sump to an auxiliary building, outside the main containment, until the sump pumps were stopped at 4:39am.|$|E
25|$|The release {{occurred}} when the cladding was damaged while the pilot-operated <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> was still stuck open. Fission products were released into the reactor coolant. Since the pilot-operated <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> was stuck open {{and the loss of}} coolant accident was still in progress, primary coolant with fission products and/or fuel was released, and ultimately ended up in the auxiliary building. The auxiliary building was outside the containment boundary.|$|E

At 1:13 p.m., the three pressure <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> were forcibly opened as the hydrostatic head pressure of the raffinate built to over [...] above atmospheric pressure.

25|$|The {{design of}} the {{pilot-operated}} <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> indicator light was fundamentally flawed. The bulb was simply connected in parallel with the valve solenoid, thus implying that the pilot-operated <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> was shut when it went dark, without actually verifying the real position of the valve. When everything was operating correctly, the indication was true and the operators became habituated to rely on it. However, when things went wrong and the main <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> stuck open, the unlighted lamp was actually misleading the operators by implying that the valve was shut. This caused the operators considerable confusion, because the pressure, temperature and coolant levels in the primary circuit, so far as they could observe them via their instruments, were not behaving {{as they would have}} if the pilot-operated <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> were shut. This confusion contributed to the severity of the accident because the operators were unable to break out of a cycle of assumptions that conflicted with what their instruments were telling them. The problem was not correctly diagnosed until a fresh shift came in who did not have the mindset of the first shift of operators. By this time major damage had occurred.|$|E

If the regulator pressure is set to a lower pressure than the over-pressure <b>relief</b> <b>valve,</b> a closed bag will automatically stop filling before the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> opens, but will be topped up if it leaks after reaching the surface. The regulator pressure must take into account the hydrostatic pressure difference between {{the top and bottom of}} the bag so that the bag will be completely filled.|$|E

25|$|A Stirling engine uses a {{single-phase}} {{working fluid}} that maintains an internal pressure {{close to the}} design pressure, and thus for a properly designed system the risk of explosion is low. In comparison, a steam engine uses a two-phase gas/liquid working fluid, so a faulty overpressure <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> can cause an explosion.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent this}} from happening, a valve is fitted between the {{turbocharger}} and inlet, which vents off the excess air pressure. These {{are known as}} an anti-surge, diverter, bypass, turbo-relief valve, blow-off valve (BOV), or dump valve. It is a pressure <b>relief</b> <b>valve,</b> and is normally operated by the vacuum from the intake manifold.|$|E

The shock also either partially ruptured {{a line from the}} number 1 oxygen tank, or caused its check or <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> to leak, causing its contents to leak out into space over the next 130 minutes, entirely depleting the SM's oxygen supply.|$|E
25|$|In another design, {{a rubber}} housing is {{fitted with a}} {{pressure}} <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> that determines {{the speed of a}} vehicle. If the vehicle is traveling below the set speed, the valve opens allowing the bump to deflate as the vehicle drives over it, but it remains closed if the vehicle is traveling too fast. The valve can also be set to allow heavy vehicles, such as fire trucks, ambulances, and buses to cross at higher speeds.|$|E
25|$|The two first stages {{are mounted}} on {{independently}} closable valves, {{as a first}} stage freeze free-flow can only be stopped by shutting off the air supply from the cylinder until the valve has thawed out. The second regulator is there to supply the remaining gas when the first regulator is shut off. A second-stage isolation valve {{used in conjunction with}} a first-stage overpressure <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> may be effective as a quick method to manage demand valve free-flow.|$|E

40|$|<b>Relief</b> <b>valves</b> are {{integral}} part of almost any hydraulic power system; therefore special attention is given to ensure stable operation of these elements. The purpose of this work is to study internal dynamic processes in hydraulic pilot-operated <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> and define key parameters affecting dynamic performance and operational stability of the examined valves. Modeling involves creating a design scheme and a mathematical model for the specific valve. Flow balance equations for the selected model nodes and motion equations of valve's moving elements were formulated. The study revealed that internal dynamic processes in hydraulic pilot-operated <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> {{are influenced by the}} following parameters: size of the poppet valve orifice, value of the valve's enclosed volume and pump capacity. Moreover, analysis results showed that developed model is most sensitive to changes {{in the size of the}} poppet valve orifice. Developed mathematical model can be used as an effective tool for selecting rational dimensions for hydraulic pilot-operated <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> in order to provide specific dynamic properties. ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ????????, ???????????? ? ????????????????? ????????????? ????????? ????????. ??? ????????????? ???????????? ????????? ? ??????????? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ????? ? ??????????? ?????????????? ??????. ?????????? ????????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ???????? ? ????? ????????? ????? ? ????????? ???????? ????????? ????????? ?????????????????? ???????. ??????????? ??????? ??????????, ? ????????? ???????? ??????????????? ??????, ?????? ??????, ??????? ???????????? ????????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ?? ???????? ?????????? ?????????, ???????????? ? ????????????????? ??????? ????????? ????????. ????????????? ?????????????? ?????? ????? ??????? ??????????? ???????????? ??? ?????? ???????????? ???????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????????????????? ??????? ? ????? ??????????? ???????? ???????????? ???????...|$|R

25|$|Manual and {{electronically}} controlled addition valves {{are used}} on manual and electronically controlled {{closed circuit rebreathers}} (mCCR, eCCR) to add oxygen to the loop to maintain set-point. A manually or electronically controlled valve is used to release oxygen from the outlet of a standard scuba regulator first stage into the breathing loop. An over-pressure <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> on the first stage is necessary to protect the hose. Strictly speaking, these are not pressure regulators, they are flow control valves.|$|E
25|$|On 8 June 2016, Boeing's defense unit CEO, Leanne Caret, {{reported}} that a modified boom would be flown the following month. A hydraulic <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> system would be installed so that if loads build up on the boom, the valves open to relieve the pressure. The system is similar to equipment used on the booms of the KC-10 and KC-767 tankers. On 10 July 2016, Caret reported 'positive' early results after flight tests with the revised boom commenced the previous week.|$|E
25|$|If a {{shut-off}} valve is fitted {{between the first}} and second stages, as is found on scuba bailout systems used for commercial diving and in some technical diving configurations, the demand valve will normally be isolated and unable to function as a <b>relief</b> <b>valve.</b> In this case an overpressure valve must be fitted to the first stage if it does not already have one. As very few contemporary (2016) scuba regulator first stages are factory fitted with overpressure relief valves, they are available as aftermarket accessories which can be screwed into any low pressure port available on the first stage.|$|E

25|$|It {{was still}} not clear to the control room staff that the primary loop water levels were low and that {{over half of the}} core was exposed. A group of workers took manual {{readings}} from the thermocouples and obtained a sample of primary loop water. Seven hours into the emergency, new water was pumped into the primary loop and the backup <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> was opened to reduce pressure so that the loop could be filled with water. After 16hours the primary loop pumps were turned on once again, and the core temperature began to fall. A large part of the core had melted, and the system was still dangerously radioactive.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} {{began with}} {{failures in the}} non-nuclear secondary system, followed by a stuck-open pilot-operated <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> in the primary system, which allowed large amounts of nuclear reactor coolant to escape. The mechanical failures were compounded by the initial failure of plant operators to recognize the situation as a loss-of-coolant accident due to inadequate training and human factors, such as human-computer interaction design oversights relating to ambiguous control room indicators in the power plant's user interface. In particular, a hidden indicator light led to an operator manually overriding the automatic emergency cooling system of the reactor because the operator mistakenly believed that {{there was too much}} coolant water present in the reactor and causing the steam pressure release.|$|E
25|$|The Kemeny Commission {{noted that}} Babcock & Wilcox's {{pilot-operated}} <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> had previously failed on 11occasions, {{nine of them}} in the open position, allowing coolant to escape. More disturbing, however, {{was the fact that the}} initial causal sequence of events at TMI had been duplicated 18months earlier at another Babcock & Wilcox reactor, the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station owned at that time by Toledo Edison. The only difference was that the operators at Davis-Besse identified the valve failure after 20minutes, where at TMI it took 80 minutes, and the Davis-Besse facility was operating at 9% power, against TMI's 97%. Although Babcock engineers recognized the problem, the company failed to clearly notify its customers of the valve issue.|$|E
