25|$|In the 85D, {{the rear}} drive unit is {{replaced}} by a smaller one to save cost and weight, while the second motor of similar size is added to the front wheels. This results in an AWD car with comparable power and acceleration to the RWD version. Additionally, Tesla said the 85D has a 2% (5-mile) <b>range</b> <b>increase</b> and 11% increase in top speed over the 85. In the P85D, the high-power rear drive unit is retained, while a new front drive motor boosts the total power by about 50%. This results in a significant increase in acceleration and top speed. Deliveries of the P85D started in December 2014, with the 85D models starting in February 2015, and the 70D models starting in April 2015.|$|E

In general, {{children and the}} elderly are at highest risk for gastrointestinal disease. In a study investigating the association between drinking water quality and gastrointestinal illness in the elderly of Philadelphia, scientists found water quality 9 to 11 days before the visit was negatively associated with hospital admissions for gastrointestinal illness, with an interquartile <b>range</b> <b>increase</b> in turbidity being associated with a 9% increase). The association was stronger in those over 75 than in the population aged 65–74. This example is a small reflection of residents of the United States remain at risk of waterborne gastrointestinal illness under current water treatment practices.|$|E

500|$|While the 757 {{program had}} been financially successful, declining {{sales in the}} early 2000s {{threatened}} its continued viability. Airlines were again gravitating toward smaller aircraft, now mainly the 737 and A320, because of their reduced financial risk. An airline industry downturn and {{the large number of}} relatively young 757s already in service also reduced customer demand. In 2000, spurred by interest from Air 2000 and Continental Airlines, Boeing reexamined the possibility of building a longer-range [...] The proposed derivative would have featured auxiliary fuel tanks, plus wing and landing gear upgrades from the , resulting in a higher MTOW and a potential <b>range</b> <b>increase</b> to over [...] However, the proposal failed to garner any orders.

500|$|The seven-month 757 {{flight test}} program used {{the first five}} {{aircraft}} built. Tasks included flight systems and propulsion tests, hot and cold weather trials, and route-proving flights. Data from the 767 program helped expedite the process. After design issues were identified, the 757's exit doors received dual-spring mechanisms for easier operation, and the fuselage was strengthened for greater bird strike resistance. The production aircraft was [...] lighter than originally specified, and recorded a three percent better-than-expected rate of fuel burn. This resulted in a <b>range</b> <b>increase</b> of , and prompted Boeing to tout the aircraft's fuel efficiency characteristics. After 1,380 flight test hours, the RB211-powered 757 received U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification on December 21, 1982, followed by UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) certification on January 14, 1983. The first delivery to launch customer Eastern Air Lines occurred on December 22, 1982, about {{four months after the}} first 767 deliveries. The first 757 with PW2037 engines rolled out about one year later, and was delivered to Delta Air Lines on November 5, 1984.|$|E
500|$|On 5 January 2015, the Navy and Marines {{signed a}} {{memorandum}} of understanding (MOU) to buy the V-22 for the COD mission, and was confirmed in the Navy's FY 2016 budget. Initially designated HV-22, four aircraft would be bought each year from 2018–2020. It incorporates an extended-range fuel system for an [...] unrefueled range, a high-frequency radio for over-the-horizon communications, and a public address system to communicate with passengers; the <b>range</b> <b>increase</b> comes from extra fuel bladders through larger external sponsons, the version's only physical difference from other Osprey variants. Its primary mission is long-range aerial logistics, but other conceivable missions include personnel recovery and special warfare. In February 2016, the Navy officially designated it as the CMV-22B. The Navy's program of record originally called for 48 aircraft, but it later determined that only 44 were required. Production of the CMV-22 will begin in FY 2018 and start deliveries in 2020. Bell and Boeing have pitched the V-22 as a Navy platform for various missions, such as communications, electronic warfare, or aerial refueling; the Navy has a known gap in tactical aerial refueling. Other roles include search and rescue and anti-submarine warfare.|$|E
