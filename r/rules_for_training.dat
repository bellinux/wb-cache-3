5000|$|Kortge (1990) {{proposed}} a learning <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> <b>training</b> neural networks, called the 'novelty rule', to help alleviate catastrophic interference. As its name suggests, this rule helps the neural network to learn only {{the components of}} a new input that differ from an old input. Consequently, the novelty rule changes only the weights that were not previously dedicated to storing information, thereby reducing the overlap in representations at the hidden units. Thus, even when inputs are somewhat similar to another, dissimilar representations can be made at the hidden layer. In order to apply the novelty rule, during learning the input pattern {{is replaced by a}} novelty vector that represents the components that differ. The novelty vector for the first layer (input units to hidden units) is determined by taking the target pattern away from the current output of the network (the delta <b>rule).</b> <b>For</b> the second layer (hidden units to output units) the novelty vector is simply the activation of the hidden units that resulted from using the novelty vector as an input through the first layer.

For that reason, newer planes are certified using newer versions of the FARs, and in many aspects may be thus considered safer designs.|$|R
