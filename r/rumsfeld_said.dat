2500|$|Vice President Cheney, {{there have}} been new {{developments}} in Iraq, especially {{having to do with}} the administration's handling. Paul Bremer, the former head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, gave a speech in which he said that we have never had enough troops on the ground, or we've never had enough troops on the ground. Donald <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>said</b> he has not seen any hard evidence of a link between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. Was this approved [...] of a report that you requested that you received a week ago that showed there was no connection between Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and Saddam Hussein? ...|$|E
2500|$|The U-2 {{remains in}} front-line service more than 50 {{years after its}} first flight with the current U-2 {{beginning}} service in 1980. This is due primarily to its ability to change surveillance objectives on short notice, something that surveillance satellites cannot do. In the mid-1990s, it was converted from the U-2R to the U-2S, receiving the GE F118 turbofan engine. [...] The U-2 outlasted its Mach 3 replacement, the SR-71, which was retired in 1998. A classified budget document approved by the Pentagon on 23 December 2005 called for the U-2's termination no earlier than 2012, with some aircraft being retired by 2007. In January 2006, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced the U-2's pending retirement as a cost cutting measure during a larger reorganization and redefinition of the USAF's mission. <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>said</b> that this will not impair the USAF's ability to gather intelligence, which will be done by satellites and a growing supply of unmanned RQ-4 Global Hawk reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Belgian Minister of Defence André Flahaut {{expressed}} his approval of <b>Rumsfeld's</b> resignation. He <b>said</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> was [...] "obstinate", and {{he hoped that}} the elections would bring upon {{a change in the}} United States' foreign policy.|$|R
5000|$|On February 5, Karzai {{noted that}} the attack was [...] "a mistake of sorts", while Secretary of Defense Donald <b>Rumsfeld</b> later <b>said</b> that the {{battlefield}} situation had been [...] "untidy" [...] and the US had acted on [...] "persuasive and compelling" [...] intelligence.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2005, she {{published}} {{an account of}} her experiences, One Woman's Army, in which she claims that the abuses were done by contract employees trained in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, and sent to Abu Ghraib under orders from the Secretary of Defense Donald <b>Rumsfeld.</b> She <b>said</b> her demotion was political retribution.|$|R
2500|$|On August 29, 2006 Sec. Donald <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>said</b> “Over {{the next}} decades , a {{sentiment}} took root that contended that {{if only the}} growing threats that had begun to emerge in Europe and Asia could be accommodated, then the carnage {{and the destruction of}} then-recent memory of World War I could be avoided. It was a time when a certain amount of cynicism and moral confusion set in among Western democracies. When those who warned about a coming crisis, the rise of fascism and nazism, they were ridiculed or ignored. Indeed, in the decades before World War II, a great many argued that the fascist threat was exaggerated or that it was someone else's problem. Some nations tried to negotiate a separate peace, even as the enemy made its deadly ambitions crystal clear. It was, as Winston Churchill observed, a bit like feeding a crocodile, hoping it would eat you last. ...I recount that history because once again we face similar challenges in efforts to confront the rising threat of a new type of fascism. Today -- another enemy, a different kind of enemy -- has made clear its intentions with attacks in places like New York and Washington, D.C., Bali, London, Madrid, Moscow and so many other places. But some seem not to have learned history's lessons. ...With the growing lethality and the increasing availability of weapons, can we truly afford to believe that somehow, some way, vicious extremists can be appeased? Can folks really continue to think that free countries can negotiate a separate peace with terrorists?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld {{appointed}} Evan G. Galbraith as his {{representative in}} Europe {{and the defense}} advisor to the U.S. mission to NATO.

5000|$|Because {{the accused}} are charged as {{unlawful}} combatants (a certain category {{of people who}} are not classified as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions), then Secretary of Defense Donald <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>said</b> in March 2002 that an acquittal on all charges by the commission is no guarantee of a release.|$|E
50|$|Donald <b>Rumsfeld</b> had <b>said</b> that {{army and}} {{government}} {{had only been}} informed in January and not in detail. On January 16, 2004, a press release was issued by the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) stating that an investigation had been initiated in response to allegations of detainee abuse at an unspecified detention facility (now known to be Abu Ghraib prison).|$|R
50|$|Roberta Mary Morgan, {{better known}} by her married name of Roberta Wohlstetter, (August 22, 1912 - January 6, 2007), {{was one of}} America's most {{important}} historians of military intelligence. Her most influential work is Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision. The former Secretary of Defense, Donald <b>Rumsfeld,</b> is <b>said</b> to have required that his aides read it. Indeed, it was brought up during discussions of intelligence failures leading to the successful al-Qaeda attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.|$|R
5000|$|War Secretary Donald <b>Rumsfeld</b> {{may have}} <b>said</b> that invading Iraq {{had nothing to}} do with oil.

He spoke truth to power with one compelling image.It says all at once that this entire war -- its tragic casualties and immense cost -- was all about oil.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of its {{establishment}} in January 2002, Secretary of Defense Donald <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>said</b> the prison camp was established to detain extraordinarily dangerous people, to interrogate detainees in an optimal setting, and to prosecute detainees for war crimes.

5000|$|Assassinations {{of heads}} of state have been against U.S. policy since an {{executive}} order against them was issued in 1976; in response, Defense Secretary Donald <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "our department doesn't {{do that kind of}} thing." [...] Bernardo Álvarez, Venezuela's ambassador to the U.S., demanded a stronger condemnation from the White House and that the United States [...] "respect our country and its president." ...|$|E
50|$|In the debate, Bush did {{not offer}} any {{timetable}} or estimate of troops, either increasing or decreasing, but said only that the commanders of the troops in Iraq {{had the ability to}} ask for whatever force they needed. In general, this is consistent with his earlier remarks. When questioned about troop strength, Bush and then-Secretary of Defense Donald <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>said</b> that they were using the troops asked for by the general staff.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1980s, Rumsfeld {{became a}} member of the National Academy of Public Administration, and was named a member of the boards of {{trustees}} of the Gerald R.

In addition, he was asked to serve the U.S. State Department as a foreign policy consultant from 1990 to 1993. He also sat on European engineering giant Asea Brown Boveri's board from 1990 to 2001, a company which sold two light-water nuclear reactors to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization for installation in North Korea, as part of the 1994 agreed framework reached under President Bill Clinton. <b>Rumsfeld's</b> office <b>said</b> that he did not [...] "recall it being brought before the board at any time" [...] though Fortune magazine reported that [...] "board members were informed about this project." ...|$|R
40|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that as the Bush administration is mulling over plans to bomb Iran, the simmering conflict between the high-ranking military professionals and the militaristic civilian leaders is bursting into open. The conflict, festering ever since the invasion of Iraq, has now been heightened over the administration's policy of an aerial military strike against Iran. While civilian militarists, headed by Vice President Cheney and Secretary of Defense <b>Rumsfeld,</b> are <b>said</b> to have drawn plans to bomb Iran, senior commanders are openly questioning the wisdom of such plans. [1] The administration's recent statements {{that it is now}} willing to negotiate with Iran might appear as a change or modification of its plans to launch a military strike against that country. But a closer reading of those statements indicates otherwise: such pronouncements are premised on the condition that, as President Bush recently put it, "the Iranian regime fully and verifiably suspends its uranium enrichment. " In {{light of the fact that}} suspension of uranium enrichment, which is nothing beyond Iran's legitimate rights under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), is supposed to b...|$|R

[...] The Center for Policy and Research's 2006 report, based on DoD released data, found that most detainees were low-level offenders who were not affiliated with organizations on U.S. terrorist lists.|$|E
5000|$|A {{different}} set of events was portrayed by Bob Woodward in his book State of Denial. According to him, the decision never came back to Washington for input except for a lawyer from the National Security Council, who gave legal opinions {{on the first two}} CPA orders. <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>said</b> he spoke only rarely with Bremer, no NSC meeting had been convened on the matter, and that he [...] "would be surprised" [...] if either Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz or Under Secretary Feith had told Bremer to carry out the two CPA orders.|$|E
5000|$|James Robertson, {{a former}} federal {{district}} judge based in Washington {{who served on the}} secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court for three years between 2002 and 2005 and who ruled against the Bush administration in the landmark Hamdan v. <b>Rumsfeld</b> case, <b>said</b> FISA court is independent but flawed because only the government's side is represented effectively in its deliberations. [...] "Anyone who has been a judge will tell you a judge needs to hear both sides of a case," [...] said James Robertson. Without this judges do not benefit from adversarial debate. He suggested creating an advocate with security clearance who would argue against government filings. Robertson questioned whether the secret FISA court should provide overall legal approval for the surveillance programs, saying the court [...] "has turned into something like an administrative agency." [...] Under the changes brought by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008, which expanded the US government's authority by forcing the court to approve entire surveillance systems and not just surveillance warrants as it previously handled, [...] "the court is now approving programmatic surveillance. I don't think that is a judicial function." [...] Robertson also said he was [...] "frankly stunned" [...] by the New York Times report that FISA court rulings had created a new body of law broadening the ability of the NSA to use its surveillance programs to target not only terrorists but suspects in cases involving espionage, cyberattacks and weapons of mass destruction.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2005, the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times {{alleged that}} the United States {{military}} had manipulated news reported in Iraqi media {{in an effort to}} cast a favourable light on its actions while demoralising the insurgency. Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, a military spokesman in Iraq, said the program is [...] "an important part of countering misinformation in the news by insurgents", while a spokesman for former Defense Secretary Donald H. <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>said</b> the allegations of manipulation were troubling if true. The Department of Defense confirmed the existence of the program.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2004, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld {{conceded that}} Zarqawi's ties to Al Qaeda {{may have been}} much more ambiguous—and that he may have been more of a rival than a {{lieutenant}} to bin Laden. Zarqawi [...] "may very well not have sworn allegiance to Laden", <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>said</b> at a Pentagon briefing.

5000|$|In February 2003, the U.S. Army's top general, Eric Shinseki, {{told the}} Senate Armed Services Committee {{that it would}} take [...] "several hundred {{thousand}} soldiers" [...] to secure Iraq. Two days later, U.S. Defense Secretary Donald <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>said</b> the post-war troop commitment would be less than the number of troops required to win the war, and that [...] "the idea {{that it would take}} several hundred thousand U.S. forces is far from the mark." [...] Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said Shinseki's estimate was [...] "way off the mark," [...] because other countries would take part in an occupying force.|$|E
5000|$|On October 24, 2002, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld {{ordered that}} the {{functional}} and regional commanders {{be referred to}} not as [...] "CINCs" [...] but as [...] "combatant commanders" [...] when applied to [...] "unified" [...] regional organizations (e.g., USCENTCOM), or [...] "commander" [...] when talking about [...] "specified" [...] units such as the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>said</b> the term [...] "CINC" [...] was inappropriate, notwithstanding its employment for many decades, because under the United States Constitution, the President is the Nation's only commander-in-chief.

5000|$|Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated, [...] "Here {{was a man}} who {{was photographed}} {{hundreds}} of times shooting off rifles and showing how tough he was, and in fact, he wasn't very tough, he was cowering in a hole in the ground, and had a pistol and didn't use it, and certainly did not put up any fight at all. In the last analysis, he seemed not terribly brave." [...] <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>said</b> the U.S. has not decided whether to classify Saddam Hussein as a prisoner of war, but that the U.S. would abide the Geneva Conventions.

Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage to Pakistan on 6 June 2002, Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf pledged to end cross-border infiltration from Pakistan into Indian-controlled Kashmir on a permanent basis. India responded with a series of diplomatic and military steps, and acknowledged that the level of cross-border incidents had decreased. Pakistan, however, dismissed the steps taken by India as merely "cosmetic. " During his visit to India on 12 June, U. S.

40|$|What doesn’t {{work and}} how to show it Ineffectiveness is hard to prove and accept Archie Cochrane, the British epidemiologist, posed three key {{questions}} to ask about a healthcare intervention: “Can it work?” “Does it work in practice?” and “Is it worth it?” 1 It {{would be great if}} the answers to these were always positive, but life isn’t like that. The possible answers might be classed as “yes,” “not sure,” and “no. ” The rules for deciding “yes” are relatively clear and well known, but less has been written about deciding that something doesn’t work. This theme issue looks at examples of interventions that don’t appear to work, the dilemmas of trying to decide between an answer of “not sure” and “no,” and what to do when we are not sure. Doust and Del Mar admit (p 474) 2 that “Don’t just do something, stand there!” sounds ludicrous. But this is sometimes good advice, as their round up of commonly used but apparently ineffective interventions shows. This issue also includes new evidence of varying kinds and strengths on other interventions that didn’t seem to have a marked effect: a systematic review of mentoring for children with behavioural problems (p 512); 3 randomised controlled trials of adenoidectomy for children with recurrent otitis media (p 487); 4 rocking exercises in late pregnancy to turn babies from a posterior lie (p 490); 5 low dose ramipril to reduce cardiovascular and renal complications among diabetic people with microalbuminuria (p 495); 6 and an n-of- 1 trial of vitamin B- 6 for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (p 503). 7 In each case the type of evidence, its quality, and the potential benefits and harms might lead us to be more or less convinced that an intervention does more good than harm. This is very much a judgment, and if people want to believe there is an effect it can be very hard to persuade them that any effect is too small to be important. As a school textbook puts it when discussing the dilemma of industries or official bodies trying to convince the public that something poses no risk: “It is very hard to persuade people that a factor has no effect. This involves ‘proving a negative’. ” 8 When it is difficult to judge effectiveness and benefit from new research, we need all the help we can get from existing evidence. Two articles this week develop this point. McPherson and Hemminki argue that if trials done by pharmaceutical companies to obtain drug licences had to include adequate data on harms and ineffectiveness we could learn much more quickly what we need to know about new drugs (p 518). 9 Pound et al propose systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the animal studies that supposedly underpin much human clinical research. 10 Such reviews could assess the validity and generalisability to humans of animal research and could prevent unnecessary treatment trials. Even with all the evidence we can muster, we are often left being uncertain about the right treatment choice. 11 As US defense secretary Donald <b>Rumsfeld</b> <b>said</b> at a press briefing on Iraq: “Reports that say that something hasn’t happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don’t know we don’t know. ” 12 This much ridiculed statement won the Plain English Campaign’s Foot in Mouth award for 2003, but it does make sense when read carefully. Perhaps what we don’t know we don’t know would be a good topic for a BMJ theme issue: let us know if you agree...|$|E
