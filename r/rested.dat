40|$|The {{repressor}} element 1 -silencing {{transcription factor}} (<b>REST)</b> {{functions as a}} master regulator to maintain neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs). <b>REST</b> undergoes proteasomal degradation through β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination during neuronal differentiation. However, reciprocal mechanisms that stabilize <b>REST</b> in NPCs are undefined. Here we show that deubiquitinase HAUSP counterbalances <b>REST</b> ubiquitination and prevents NPC differentiation. HAUSP expression declines concordantly with <b>REST</b> upon neuronal differentiation and reciprocally with β-TrCP levels. HAUSP knockdown in NPCs decreases <b>REST</b> and induces differentiation. In contrast, HAUSP overexpression up-regulates <b>REST</b> by overriding β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination. A consensus site (310 -PYSS- 313) of human <b>REST</b> is required for HAUSP-mediated <b>REST</b> deubiquitination. Furthermore, <b>REST</b> overexpression in NPCs rescues the differentiation phenotype induced by HAUSP knockdown. These data demonstrate that HAUSP stabilizes <b>REST</b> through deubiquitination and antagonizes β-TrCP in regulating <b>REST</b> at post-translational level. Thus, the HAUSP-mediated deubiquitination represents a critical regulatory mechanism involved in the maintenance of NPCs.

Hassett's bowlers then dismissed the hosts for 196 in the second innings, sealing victory by an innings and 51 runs. In the following match against Essex, Bradman returned and Hassett was <b>rested</b> as Australia won the toss and batted first, scoring a world-record of 721 first-class runs in one day. The visitors then proceeded to victory by an innings and 451 runs, their biggest winning margin for the summer.

50|$|A regular weekly <b>rest</b> {{period is}} a period of at least 45 {{consecutive}} hours. An actual working week starts {{at the end of a}} weekly <b>rest</b> period, and finishes when another weekly <b>rest</b> period is commenced, which may mean that weekly <b>rest</b> is taken in the middle of a fixed (Monday-Sunday) week. This is perfectly acceptable - the working week is not required to be aligned with the ‘fixed’ week defined in the rules, provided all the relevant limits are complied with. Alternatively, a driver can take a reduced weekly <b>rest</b> period of a minimum of 24 consecutive hours. If a reduction is taken, it must be compensated for by an equivalent period of <b>rest</b> taken in one block before the end of the third week following the week in question. The compensating <b>rest</b> must be attached to a period of <b>rest</b> of at least 9 hours - in effect either a weekly or a daily <b>rest</b> period.For example, where a driver reduces a weekly <b>rest</b> period to 33 hours in week 1, he must compensate for this by attaching a 12-hour period of <b>rest</b> to another <b>rest</b> period of at least 9 hours before the end of week 4. This compensation cannot be taken in several smaller periods. A weekly <b>rest</b> period that falls in two weeks may be counted in either week but not in both.However, a <b>rest</b> period of at least 69 hours in total may be counted as two back-to-back weekly <b>rests</b> (e.g. a 45-hour weekly <b>rest</b> followed by 24 hours), provided that the driver does not exceed 144 hours’ work either before or after the <b>rest</b> period in question. Where reduced weekly <b>rest</b> periods are taken away from base, these may be taken in a vehicle, provided that it has suitable sleeping facilities and is stationary.|$|R

The home team were put into bat on a drying pitch by vice-captain Lindsay HassettBradman had <b>rested</b> himself for the match. Johnston bowled for almost the whole innings, sending down 38.4 of 85.4 overs. He took wickets at regular intervals to end with 6/74 as Hampshire were bowled out for 195. Johnston was unbeaten on two as Australia lost 8/47 and collapsed to 117 all out, trailing by 78 runs. It was the first time that the tourists had conceded a first innings lead for the season. In the second innings, Johnston bowled unchanged at his end for the entire innings, providing steady breakthroughs to end with 5/43 as Hampshire were bowled out for 103. This left Australia a target of 182, and they batted fluently in their second innings to win by eight wickets. Johnston ended with match figures of 11/117. He was <b>rested</b> in the innings win over Sussex, in the last fixture before the First Test.|$|E

Within each period of 24 hours {{after the end of}} the previous daily <b>rest</b> period or weekly <b>rest</b> period a driver must take a new daily <b>rest</b> period. An 11-hour (or more) daily <b>rest</b> is called a regular daily <b>rest</b> period. Alternatively, a driver can split a regular daily <b>rest</b> period into two periods.
