40|$|This {{paper will}} focus on changes to the {{implementation}} of road safety inspections in Ireland following the requirement, under EU Directive 2008 / 96 /EC on Road Infrastructure Safety Management, for the establishment of periodic <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>inspections</b> (<b>RSI)</b> of existing roads, along with safety impact assessments, high accident concentration ranking and road safety audits (RSA). Ireland, along with fellow EU member states, were required to adopt guidelines ensuring road safety inspections were carried out by a competent entity in order to safeguard adequate safety levels for road infrastructure. By using a case study, this paper will outline the transition Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has made by embracing new technology. This proactive approach to improving road safety contrasts with the reactive ‘black spot’ approach based on historical collision data. Incorporating RSI and the additional requirements (e. g. RSA) of the Directive 2008 / 96 /EC into existing design standards has provided TII complimentary tools to better enable designers’ effect positive change to the road environment in Ireland...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Inspections</b> (<b>RSI)</b> are {{recognized}} as an effective tool for identifying safety deficiencies of road infrastructures. They represent a low cost process {{for the evaluation of}} the network safety performance. Its applicability in rural local roads, where accident data generally do not give enough information for the safety analysis, make the procedure very attractive. However, due to the subjective nature of the process RSI may give rise to disagreements which limit their effectiveness. The paper describes the RSI procedures defined by the IASP research program. The IASP project is funded by European Commission (DG TREN) and Province of Catania (Italy) with the scientific support and collaboration of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of University of Catania. The project is aimed at defining a methodological approach for the safety analysis and the restoration of rural highways specially suited for local rural roads. Various countries adopted RSI procedures but, in the main, they are not operational in nature. As part of the project, safety inspections of 100 km of two lane rural roads have been carried out.

In {{the framework of the}} IASP research program sponsored by European Commission, which is focused on rural two-lane highways, a RSI procedure aimed at improving the effectiveness and the reliability of the methodology has been defined. For this purpose, the research has been pinpointed on the inspection framework, on the inspectors and client roles and, with special emphasis, on the methodologies used for identifying and ranking the safety problems. In order to test the reliability of the methodology, the agreement {{of the results of the}} safety issues ranks produced by different inspectors has been addressed. Specifically, the statistic kappa has been used. Results show that there is a statistically significant level of agreement among inspectors for the majority of the safety issues. The reliability of the procedure is satisfactory, specially if it is considered that the identification of the safety issues is a very complex task based on human evaluations and expertise not supported by instrumental measures...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To reduce traffic {{congestion}} at an at-grade intersection near a big city, one method is construction a flyover bridge {{at the old}} junction in two directions {{on one of the}} main highways. The flyover facilitates the traffic flow in the directions of the bridge, but the infrastructure cannot fully solve all of the problems especially on the secondary road. Under the bridge, although it relieves the {{traffic congestion}} at the intersection; the traffic signal still uses the same control as the “before ” situation, that is the fixed time control plan. With the flyover bridge in place, it was found that about 30 - 35 % of all traffic volumes diverted to the bridges, and time delay reduced by 30 % over the same period. This paper which is one part of the first author’s thesis, presents the issues that still exist at the flyover-improved junction and makes suggestions to increase the benefits of the flyover such as creating a new cycle and phase times and improving the physical area under the bridge. The SIDRA software is used to determine the appropriate fixed time plans, and using the process of <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Inspection</b> (<b>RSI)</b> to audit the safety of the site and presents the improvements to the remaining problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{instruments}} of Road Safety Audits (RSA) and <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Inspections</b> (<b>RSI)</b> {{are part of}} the Road infrastructure safety management. With the official recommendations for Road safety audits this method was introduced in Germany in the year 2002. Following the European Directive 2008 / 96 /EC and taking into account the experiences from more than 13 years of auditing the German recommendations are actualized and upgraded at the moment to a mandatory standard including RSA and RSI requirements. While the first road safety auditors in Germany were trained for motorways and rural roads the author developed together with other institutions the certification course and the RSA process for urban roads and residential roads. Germany might be the only state, where Road Safety Auditors are certified for different road categories and especially are divided into interurban and urban auditors. More than 130 auditors were certified and are now working as auditors for the urban road categories. Certificates are awarded with three years validity. Requirements for extensions are the verification of three audits and the participation in two courses. Yearly the „Symposia for road safety with auditor forums“ take part at the University of Wuppertal where actual research outputs in the field of Urban Road Safety are presented and critical audits like those for complex intersections, cycling and walking infrastructure or great residential zones are discussed...|$|E

The goal of the international project BALTRIS is to elaborate the road and street infrastructure safety management procedures and teaching material consistently explaining the above mentioned infrastructure management procedures. Four Baltic Sea region countries (Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), represented by universities and national road administrations participate in the elaboration of these procedures and teaching material. This article describes the scope of NSR, RSA and RSI procedures prepared in the frame of BALTRIS project, also article provides detailed implementation and execution of procedures for the EU Member States. NSR means a method for identifying, analysing and classifying parts of the existing road network according to their potential for safety development and accident cost savings. Ranking of high accident concentration sections means a method to identify, analyse and rank sections of the road network which have been in operation for 3 divided by 5 years and upon which a large number of fatal/injury accidents in proportion to the traffic flow or compared to respective conditions have occurred. RSI is a strategic comparative analysis of the impact of the new road or a substantial modification to the existing network on the safety performance of the road network.

40|$|AbstractThe general {{objective}} of the ECOROADS project is to overcome the barrier established by the formal interpretation of the two Directives 2008 / 96 /EC (on road infrastructure safety management) and 2004 / 54 /EC (on tunnels), that in practice do not allow the same Road Safety Audits/Inspections to be performed inside tunnels. The main problem is that, while from the user (driver) point of view a road is a unique linear infrastructure generally in open terrain and sometimes in closed environment (tunnels), the strict application of the two Directives leads to a non-uniform approach to the infrastructure safety management outside and inside tunnels. To overcome this barrier, ECOROADS projects aims at {{the establishment of a}} common enhanced approach to road infrastructure and tunnel safety management by using the concepts and criteria of the Directive, 2008 / 96 /CE on road infrastructure safety management and the results of related European Commission (EC) funded projects. Such an objective will be achieved through the following specific activities:Workshops with the stakeholders (European tunnel and road managers); Analysis/review of national practices regarding <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Inspections</b> (<b>RSI)</b> and Road Safety Audits (RSA), starting from the results of the two studies recently launched by the EC's Directorate for Mobility and Transport {{to assess the impact of}} the two Directives 2008 / 96 /EC and 2004 / 54 /EC [...] Exchange of best practices and experiences between European tunnel experts and road safety professionals; [...] Pilot joint safety operations in five European road sections which feature both open roads and tunnels; [...] Recommendations and guidelines for the application of the RSA and RSI concepts within the tunnel safety operations;Thanks to the high transferability of the ECOROADS results, the present formal gap between the Directive, 2008 / 96 /EC and the Directive 2004 / 54 /EC will be bridged, thus leading to “faster, more sustainable and better planned interventions with maximum safety for the workers and other traffic participants”...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the work {{undertaken}} in Ireland on updating and implementing design standards {{in compliance with the}} recent requirements set out in the EU Directive on <b>Road</b> Infrastructure <b>Safety</b> Management (RISM). These improved standards complement the actions in Ireland’s <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> Strategy (RSS) that aim to reduce road deaths and serious injuries on our roads. Issues dealing with the practical problems associated with collecting large volumes of data, during drive through route inspections, are addressed. Solutions described herein and adopted have helped resolve some of the challenges associated with this type of data collection programme. Significant {{progress has been made in}} this area over a relatively short period. The RISM programme in Ireland has moved from data collection through analysis and review. Currently there is a programme underway implementing solutions on the ground. In tandem with the inspection programme, the principles behind forgiving roadsides have been catered for in the design process and new guidelines issued. This philosophy sits well with the move to a safe systems approach, as set out in the <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> Strategy, currently in operation in Ireland. The guidelines and standards developed in recent years are expected to deliver substantial safety benefits. However the priority for now is ensuring these standards are disseminated to designers and programmes like the <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> programme (<b>RSI)</b> put into operation. Beyond the design standards introduced for motorways and major interurban routes, this paper includes a section on Ireland’s new urban street standards. Other notable inclusions within the paper relate to the development of credible speed limits for the older legacy rural road network, in a progressive move away from a blanket speed limit based on road function. Ireland will continue to improve its road design standards and much of this work will be informed from Ireland’s participation with research as administrated by Conference of European Directors of Roads (CEDR TG <b>Road</b> <b>Safety...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the contest}} of the EU program “ Road Safety in EU: the 1997 - 2001 program”, the “IASP” project, {{proposed}} by the Province of Catania with the scientific support of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of University of Catania, was approved and co-funded by European Commission (DG TREN). A methodological approach for the safety evaluation of two-lane rural highway segments that uses both analytical procedures referring to road safety inspection processes and alignment design consistency models is presented. <b>Road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>inspections</b> (<b>RSI)</b> are recognized as an effective tool for identifying safety issues. However, due to the subjective nature of the process, they may give rise to disagreements which limit their effectiveness. A RSI procedure aimed at improving the effectiveness and {{the reliability of the}} methodology was defined. Many studies show that safety evaluations based on the analysis of alignment design consistency can be effective in identifying hazardous road locations. The proposed approach makes use of theoretical-experimental models for the evaluation of alignment design consistency. A safety index (SI) that quantitatively measures the relative safety performance of a road segment is calculated from the procedure. The SI is formulated by combining three components of risk: the exposure of road users to road hazards, the probability of a vehicle being involved in an accident and the resulting consequences should an accident occur. Validation of the procedure was carried out on a sample of roads by a comparison of the risk rank obtained using the SI and accident history. The SI was assessed in 30 segments chosen from a sample of two-lane rural highways in Italy and the actual accident situation was obtained with the EB procedure. Spearman’s rank-correlation was used to determine the level of agreement between the rankings obtained using the two techniques. The results from the Spearman’s rank-correlation analysis validate the SI, indicating that the ranking from the SI scores and the EB estimates agree at the 99. 9 % level of significance with a correlation coefficient equal to 0. 8...|$|E

The IASP project is funded by European Commission (DG TREN) and Province of Catania (Italy) with the scientific support and collaboration of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of University of Catania. The project is aimed at defining a methodological approach for the safety analysis and the restoration of rural highways specially suited for local rural roads. Various countries adopted RSI procedures but, in the main, they are not operational in nature. As part of the project, safety inspections of 100 km of two lane rural roads have been carried out. The IASP safety inspection procedures reflect the scope of the project and give some quantitative safety evaluation, to the best extent compatible with a methodology mainly based on subjective evaluations. The research was aimed at defining a RSI operative procedure able to improve the effectiveness and reliability of the methodology. For this purpose, the research was focused on the review framework, on the reviewers and client roles and, with special emphasis, on the methodologies used for identifying and ranking the safety problems. Phases of the inspection procedures have been defined: preliminary inspection, general inspection, detailed inspection and night time inspection. For each phase, objectives of the inspection, needed equipments, inspection methodology and roles of each team member have been defined and synthetically described in the paper. General inspection checklists, relative to the main safety features which may be present with continuity along two lane rural roads, and detailed inspection modules, differentiated for segments and intersections, have been defined. Moreover, criteria for identifying and ranking safety issues have been briefly reported. Last, the review report contents and format have been described. The procedure has proved to be effective to identify most safety issues. As far as alignment geometric defects and design consistency evaluation is concerned, RSI are not as valuable such as the quantitative methods, that may usefully integrate the inspection results. As a research outcome, a RSI operative manual has been edited. It allows to transfer to other road agencies the acquired knowledge and to obtain a greater objectivity in the inspection process...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe study {{objective}} is to compare three approaches to identification of hazardous road locations: (1) Traditional reactive accident-based approach, resulting in identification of accident black spots; (2) State-of-the-art empirical Bayes method using accident prediction model, which identifies critical locations, i. e. both real and potential black spots; (3) Proactive “preliminary” <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>inspection,</b> identifying the risk factors, which may potentially increase accident occurrence and severity. Regional rural road network (approx. 1000 km) in South Moravia, Czech Republic was used. The methods were applied in identification and ranking of hazardous road locations in the studied network.

To overcome this barrier, the PILOT 4 SAFETY project is applying the Directive's approach to some selected secondary roads in 5 regions of different EU States, in order to share good practices and define a common standardised certification methodology for <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> experts. The pilot project is being developed in 5 different phases: 1) Development of a new Curriculum for the training of <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> personnel, mainly based on <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> Audit and <b>Inspections</b> of secondary roads, foreseeing a specific certification; 2) International agreement between the 5 participating States about the validity of the certification in each State; 3) Training of the future auditors and inspectors; 4) One <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> Audit and <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Inspection</b> in each State, performed by an international team of the trained auditors or inspectors; 5) Evaluation of the results and final recommendations for a European Common Certification Methodology.

40|$|The Information Communication Technology (ICT) {{tools such}} as Geographical Information Systems (GIS) {{technology}} {{have a number of}} applications including <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> analysis. Hence it has provided a powerful tool for developing reliable database which can be used in the analysis of road accident data. This paper presents such a development of road traffic accident hotspots identification technique along a road using a Modified Voronoi Process (MVP) technique developed by the authors. This was facilitated by the development of GISbased road accident database. Three consecutive years’ data on Gadong road were acquired and used in the study. The analysis incorporated the computation of hotspot zone dimension (HZD) that led to the definition of a Road traffic Accident (RTA) hotspot for Brunei. Such ICT applications were nonexistent in Brunei Darussalam and this research has shown the potential of this technique and the consequent tangible benefit that will facilitate the Brunei Road Department in their effort to carry out road maintenance program for the national road network. The application of this technique has already contributed to the work in <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> of the current road network and is being used as a future tool for assessing the <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> level of an individual road with time and between two or more road...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCrashes are {{events that}} involve the {{interaction}} of different components: road, driver, vehicle and environment. Nevertheless, road is an essential component and improvements on road conditions {{are directly related to}} increased traffic safety. From 2008 to 2010 a <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> project was developed, whose aim was to identify and collect information about hazardous points on the Complementary Road Network of Andalusia, Spain, and build a database with this information. These elements were technically called Susceptible Elements of Improvement (ESM), which are defined as elements on the road that show worse road conditions than the ideal <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> standards. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} study the relationship between ESMs, number of crashes and hazardous sections, by analysing the information gathered in this database with advanced data mining techniques. Economically, this project is rather beneficial, since the resources of governments are limited, and therefore, it is necessary to intervene in those sections that have a higher cost-effectiveness ratio. Therefore, these relationships between roads conditions and crashes will be identified by analysing the information available in this data set of the Government of Andalusia, which has not been previously used...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> infrastructure management {{is to ensure}} that when roads are planned, designed, built and used road risks can be systematically identified, assessed, removed and mitigated. There are a number of approaches to <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> management. European Union Directive 2008 / 96 /EC requires EU member states to use four basic tools of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> infrastructure management. An overview of the methods in these countries shows a variety of approaches to how these tools are used in practice. The paper presents a systematics of these tools and a concept of how they could be developed in Poland. It looks at the life cycle of a road structure and the requirements of risk management processes. The paper focuses on elements of scientific support to help build the necessary tools. To help with assessing the impact of a road project on the <b>safety</b> of related <b>roads,</b> a method was developed for long-term forecasts of accidents and accident victims and accident cost estimation as well as a risk classification to identify risks that are not acceptable risks. With regard to <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> audits and <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>inspection,</b> a set of principles was developed to identify risks and the basic classification of errors and omissions. In the case of <b>road</b> network <b>safety</b> management, measures of individual and societal risk were selected. A method for classifying dangerous road sections was developed as well. An estimation is given of the consequences and effects of applying the tools of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> management on the network of national roads in Poland until 2020...|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis {{presents}} {{the process of}} making school routes plan. The researched area has still been developing in Slovenia and it needs clearer legislation and content frames. The {{most important part of the}} content are clear and useful instructions, which would direct schools from the beginning to the end of {{the process of making}} school routes plan. One of the documents is especially for schools adjusted control list as an accessory for assessment of school paths' security and a tool for discovering of problematic spots and situations that children could meet. In the thesis, the influence of the developmental features and mobility of children, conditions, and causes for traffic accidents, where children are involved, are presented. There is also current legislation presented and all the needed steps and roles of the participants who prepare school routes plan. A comparison of the whole process with examples of good practice in our country and abroad has also been done. Based on general approach of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>inspection</b> and sources, which researches safety of children on their way to school, control lists of certain areas have been done. Slovene technical specifications, rulebooks, and laws for the area of traffic safety have been used with that. Clear criteria for control spots have been given for identification of problematic spots and situations on school routes. Control lists have been practically tested on the school routes of the Primary school F. S. Finžgar Lesce. At the end, the results and findings of the field examination with all the perceived imperfections of the chosen school's school routes safety assessment have been presented...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPublished on 19 November 2008, the European Union's Directive 2008 / 96 /EC {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} EU documents setting out a <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> orientation, in particular, <b>road</b> infrastructure <b>safety</b> management. It identifies four main areas of activity: <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> impact assessment, <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> audit, ranking of high accident concentration sections and network <b>safety</b> ranking and <b>road</b> infrastructure <b>safety</b> <b>inspection.</b> The Directive was implemented in Poland under the Act of 13 April 2012 “on amending the Public Roads Act and some other Acts”. The Act implements three of the Directive's four actions: <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> assessment, <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> audit, ranking of sections and network ranking. The Directive is further implemented under documents issued by the Director of the General Directorate for National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA). In 2011 the GDDKiA commissioned the Gdansk University of Technology and Krakow University of Technology to prepare an Instruction for <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> Assessment. The document helps with conducting the procedure for all newly designed national roads. Having implemented these guidelines, the GDDKiA, in an effort to improve design quality, requires designers to prepare such assessments for all planned and newly designed national <b>roads.</b> The <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> assessment uses a generalised model of linear regression to estimate the relations between selected road and traffic factors and selected <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> measures (number of accidents, injuries, fatalities and accident costs). The procedure comprises around twelve steps and differs depending on the type of road (class G, GP, A and S roads) and cross-section (1 × 2, 2 × 2, 2 × 3). It includes a number of variables representing road location, year of analysis and roadside. The authors of this article present a concept of implementing computational procedures previously used for a <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> impact assessment in the PTV Visum application. As a result, it will be possible to include models used for assessing selected <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> measures into the traffic volume forecast tool. Thanks to this it will be possible to calculate the number of accidents, victims and accident costs for all analysed variants of traffic spatial distribution. By automating this process, we will be able to speed up work and reduce analytical errors...|$|R
40|$|This report surveys current {{practice}} {{in a sample of}} European countries with respect to the use of ten different tools for <b>safety</b> management of <b>road</b> systems. The report also proposes steps that can be taken to bring the use of these management tools closer to their state-of-the-art versions. These tools and their intended functions include: 1. <b>Road</b> <b>safety</b> audits, to help incorporating the best knowledge about how to design a safe road into decisions about the design and construction of new roads, thus making new roads safer than existing <b>roads,</b> 2. <b>Safety</b> <b>inspections,</b> which are ordinary periodical verification of the characteristics and defects that require maintenance work for reasons of safety, 3. Network screening, to survey <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> on the entire road system and identify those parts of the system that have a higher expected number of accidents, or a higher severity of accidents, {{than the rest of the}} system, 4. Accident modelling, to help identify and assess the importance of various factors that contribute to accidents and injuries, 5. Road protection scoring, to help identify roads which offer substandard protection from injury in case of an accident, 6. The identification and analysis of hazardous road locations, i. e. road locations that have an abnormally high number of accidents due to deficiencies of road design and/or traffic control, 7. <b>Road</b> <b>safety</b> impact assessment, which estimates the safety benefits expected from various <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> measures before these measures are introduced, 8. Monitoring of road user behaviour, to help detect unwanted changes in behaviour that may have an important effect on <b>road</b> <b>safety,</b> 9. Traffic conflict studies and naturalistic driving behaviour studies, which is the study of events that nearly lead to accidents or of driver behaviour in a natural setting, 10. In-depth accident studies, in order to learn more about the factors that precipitate accidents and the opportunities for controlling or removing these factors. A questionnaire survey was conducted in order to describe current use of these tools and assess the applicability, or ease of use, of the tools. The survey found that all countries use several of the tools listed above, but few countries use all of them. (Author/publisher...|$|R

40|$|Research on {{all aspects}} of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> for older drivers is {{becoming}} increasingly important {{as a result of}} both higher population age and increased crash exposure for older drivers. In this paper we investigate two important, yet largely under-researched issues regarding older drivers; first, we examine perceptions regarding <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> issues and, second, we relate perceptions to driving assessment and self-assessment. Data were collected through a questionnaire that was administered to forty active male drivers between 65 and 74 years old regarding their perceptions of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> issues; the driving performance of the same drivers was later assessed and self-assessed through an on-road experiment along an urban freeway. Results suggest that drivers may be aware of their reduced driving skills and recognize the need to improve their performance. We note that, as expected, drivers more familiar with the freeway perform better yet experience some discomfort during exiting maneuvers. Our findings may be of particular importance in older driver education, assessment, freeway design and <b>safety</b> <b>inspections...</b>|$|R
