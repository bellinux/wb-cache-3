5000|$|The KW-37, code named JASON, was an {{encryption}} system developed In the 1950s by the U.S. National Security Agency to protect fleet broadcasts of the U.S. Navy. Naval doctrine calls for warships at sea to maintain radio silence {{to the maximum}} extent possible to prevent ships from being located by potential adversaries using radio direction finding. To allow ships to receive messages and orders, the navy broadcast a continuous stream of information, originally in Morse code and later using radioteletype. Messages were included in this stream as needed and could be for individual ships, battle groups or the fleet as a whole. Each ship's radio room would monitor the broadcast and decode and forward those messages directed at her to the appropriate officer. The KW-37 was designed to automate this process. It consisted of two major components, the KWR-37 <b>receive</b> <b>unit</b> and the KWT-37 transmit unit. Each ship had a complement of KWR-37 receivers (usually at least two) that decrypted the fleet broadcast and fed the output to teleprinter machines. KWT-37's were typically located at shore facilities, where high power transmitters were located.|$|E

40|$|A {{relatively}} inexpensive instrumentation system that includes units that {{are connected to}} thermocouples and that are parts of a radio-communication network has been developed to enable monitoring of temperatures at multiple locations. Because {{there is no need}} to string wires or cables for communication, the system is well suited for monitoring temperatures at remote locations and for applications in which frequent changes of monitored or monitoring locations are needed. The system can also be adapted to monitoring of slowly varying physical quantities, other than temperature, that can be transduced by solid-state electronic sensors. electronic sensors. The system comprises any number of transmitting units and a single <b>receiving</b> <b>unit.</b> Each transmitting unit includes connections for as many as four external thermocouples, a signal-conditioning module, a control module, and a radio-communication module. The signal-conditioning module acts as an interface between the thermocouples and the rest of the transmitting unit and includes a built-in solid ambient temperature sensor that is in addition to the external thermocouples. The control module is a system-on-chip embedded processor that includes analog-to-digital converters, serial and parallel data ports, and an interface for local connection to an analog meter that is used during installation to verify correct operation. The radio-communication module contains a commercial spread-spectrum transceiver that operates in the 900 -MHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency band. This transceiver transmits data to the <b>receiving</b> <b>unit</b> at a rate of 19, 200 baud. The <b>receiving</b> <b>unit</b> includes a transceiver like that of a transmitting unit, plus a control module that contains a system-on-chip processor that includes serial data port for output to a computer that runs monitoring and/or control software, a parallel data port for output to a printer, and a seven-segment light-emitting-diode display. Each transmitting unit is battery-powered and can operate for at least seven days continuously while reporting temperatures every half hour. The <b>receiving</b> <b>unit</b> is powered by a wall-mounted transformer source. The <b>receiving</b> <b>unit</b> responds to each transmitting unit and reports the readings of each of the four thermocouples and of the ambient-temperature sensor of the transmitting unit. The end-to-end accuracy of the system is plus or minus 0. 2 C over the temperature range from 0 to 100 C.
