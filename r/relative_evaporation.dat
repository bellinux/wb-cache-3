40|$|Based on {{physical}} consideration of land surface energy balance, a theory is proposed for assessing relative soil {{moisture in the}} rooting depth with remote sensing data. The basis of the theory is the derivation of relative soil moisture in the rooting zone which is theoretically shown to be derivable from <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation.</b> The relationship derived between the relative soil moisture and <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> is confirmed with experimental data collected with lysimeter measurements and in intensive field campaigns. Further it is shown that the proposed theory {{can be used to}} define a drought severity index (DSI) for drought monitoring, when the <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> can be determined with remote sensing data. For this purpose, a demonstration in North China is performed. The used remote sensing data are NOAA/AVHRR which is available on a daily basis. the required meteorological data (wind speed. air temperature. humidity and pressure) are obtained from the operational measurement network of the National Meteorological Center of China. Comparisons between the estimated DSI and the actual measurements of soil moisture confirm the validity and robustness of the proposed theory. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Considering the Autocorrelation function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation function (PACF) and trend of data, appropriate models were fitted. The significance of the parameters of the selected models was examined by SE and t statistics, and both stationarity and invertibility conditions of Autoregressive (AR) and Moving average (MA) were also tested.

40|$|Evaporation {{from the}} soil is an {{important}} part of the water balance of a crop, when considering water use efficiency. In this paper, a non-intensive method is tested to estimate relative soil evaporation, which is based upon a linear function of soil surface temperature change between a saturated and drying soil. The <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> (RE) method of Ben-Asher et al. (1983) was calibrated using microlysimeters and thermal imaging. Soil surface temperature in a drip irrigated vineyard was then collected using infrared temperature sensors mounted on a quad bike, on several days of the 2009 – 2010 season. Soil surface temperature in the vineyard ranged from 4. 6 °C to 65. 5 °C undervine and 6. 8 °C to 75. 6 °C in the middle of the row. The difference between daily minima and maxima of soil surface temperature ranged from 20. 2 °C to 59. 7 °C in the inter-row and 13. 6 °C to 36. 4 °C undervine. <b>Relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> averaged 54 % of evaporation from a saturated soil in the inter-row and 97 % undervine. Based upon the calculation of RE, the average daily amount of soil evaporation undervine was between 0. 64 mm and 1. 83 mm, and between 0. 69 mm and 2. 52 mm inter-row.

40|$|Evaporation from nonsaturated {{surfaces}} is investigated. The {{concept of}} potential evaporation is first examined; {{a series of}} definitions are developed and classified, and it is shown {{that the relationship between}} potential and actual evaporation rates depends on the controlling variables in the chosen definition for potential evaporation. Extending the work of Penman (1948) to the unsaturated case, a general equation is derived to describe evaporation from nonsaturated surfaces. Applying Bouchet's (1963) hypothesis with a consistent set of definitions also leads to the same general equation. To account for departures from the saturated condition, the equation makes use of the concept of <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation,</b> the ratio of the actual evaporation rate to the rate which would occur under the prevailing atmospheric conditions if the surface was saturated at the actual surface temperature. A relationship is established between the <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation,</b> G, and a dimensionless parameter called the relative drying power, D, the ratio of the drying power (the evaporation rate which would occur if the surface was saturated at the actual air temperature) to the sum of the drying power and the net available energy. The relationship is non-dimensional and appears to be single-valued. An experimental investigation of evaporation from bare soil and growing wheat is carried out; data from an energy balance installation show that the G-D estimates of evaporation are in close agreement with calculations obtained using the Bowen ratio approach. The data are also used to refine the relationship between <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> and relative drying power. The G-D estimates of evaporation also agree closely with independent estimates obtained from the soil water balance at three sites during the growing season. The combination of this G-D relationship with the derived general evaporation equation constitutes a simple model for obtaining estimates of evaporation from nonsaturated surfaces; no prior estimate of the potential evaporation is required, and the surface conditions of temperature and humidity need not be known. A preliminary relationship is found for the vapour transfer coefficient (used in a Dalton type transfer equation) for daily time periods. Algorithms are presented for the estimation of daily net radiation and for soil heat flux. A new approach is proposed for the application of remotely-sensed surface temperature data to the estimate of regional evaporation. A relationship is derived between the surface temperature and the vapour pressure deficit in the air. The relationship allows for the use of remotely-sensed data in evaporation models such as that presented above. The method is shown to provide superior results to the simplified energy balance approach currently being applied...|$|E
40|$|A {{sediment}} core from Lake Butrint {{in southwestern}} Albania contains an annually-layered sequence coveringthe last ∼ 300 years. It provides thus an exceptionally well-dated time series to study past climate-drivenenvironmental changes, {{as well as}} anthropogenic perturbations {{along the coast of}} the Ionian Sea. The varvesare composed of organic-rich carbonate couplets and detritus-dominated clay layers. The first are depositedduring spring-to-fall, and reflect the chemistry of the lake, which, in turn, is sensitive to 1) the relativeimportance of marine versus freshwater inputs, 2) <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> rates, and 3) the productivity cyclewithin the lake. The detrital laminae are deposited during winter, reflecting precipitation and runoffconditions during the wet season. A 2 – 3 ‰ stable carbon isotope ratio shift in both bulk organics andauthigenic carbonates was attributed to increasing eutrophication {{towards the end of the}} 20 th century, andvalidated by historical and instrumental data. An increase in the δ 18 O of authigenic carbonates by more than 8 ‰ indicates the progressive salinization of the lake, which can primarily be attributed to man-madeperturbations that reduced the freshwater input to the lake and/or enhanced the exchange with seawaterfrom the nearby Ionian Sea. A recent increase in the <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> versus precipitation rates may haveadditionally contributed to the observed 18 O enrichment in the Lake Butrint carbonates. The interdecadalcyclicity in the thickness of the detrital laminae seems to be at least partially controlled by NAO and/orENSO-like phenomena that modulate precipitation patterns in the eastern Mediterranean.

The spontaneous decay profiles were used to extract decay parameters of the large organic anion zink phthalocyanine (ZnPc). Numerical simulations of the decay process show good agreement with measurements, using parameters derived from an analytical approximation also used for fullerenes.

This paper considers data from direct measurements of evaporation from the Pevensey Levels wet grassland using the eddy correlation method. Equations are derived to predict actual evaporation using meteorological data on the site or from standard meteorological station observations. It was found that evaporation could be estimated reliably from meteorological variables, such as wind speed, temperature and humidity and by water availability.

In comparison with the standard MAT, MIT provides a 5 -fold {{reduction in the number}} of effector and target cells without changing the final reaction volume. This avoids the excessive <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> that could occur in microassays employing limited reaction volumes.

The Dalton-type bulk transfer (BT) approach typically applied in land surface schemes considers turbulent transfer along the humidity gradient between the surface and atmosphere as diagnosed from the land surface temperature. In this case, surface temperature was observed radiometrically rather than modelled. The models were evaluated for several temporal scales from 15 min to seasonal, and compared with measured evaporation data obtained by an eddy covariance system. Results suggest that all three approaches have ‘reasonable ’ applicability for estimating evaporation at point-scales for periods longer than daily, but none of the methods provide consistently reliable daily or sub-daily estimates of evaporation.

40|$|Evaporation from {{bare soil}} {{surfaces}} represents an important water loss for agriculture in semi-arid regions, Numerous {{efforts have been}} undertaken to modify the topsoil characteristics (mulching, tillage) {{in order to create}} a thin dry topsoil that reduces evaporation. However, little attention was paid to the role of natural rock fragments in topsoils with respect to evaporation. This paper presents the results of laboratory experiments simulating evaporation from initially wet and air-dry soils containing a range of rock fragment contents, and compares them to field conditions, Evaporation was stimulated by blowing fans at one (high) evaporative demand (E(o) = 7. 7 - 9. 2 mm day(- 1)). Time domain reflectometry (TDR) was used to investigate the relation between the water content of the topsoil and the actual evaporation rate. For soils at field capacity, initial fine earth water content decreases with rock fragment content, and consequently evaporation rates decrease in the same order. For air-dry soils that received a limited amount of rain (10 and 20 mm), an opposite behaviour was observed. Initial fine earth water content and evaporation rates increase with rock fragment content. A strong positive sigmoidal relation between <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> rate (actual over open-pan evaporation rates) and fine earth water content in the centre of the wetted soil section was observed during the laboratory experiments.

The parameters studied were {{the position of the}} atomizer system (top spray or bottom spray), the inlet temperature of the spouting gas (80 and 150 oC) and the feed mass flow rate of concentrated extract <b>relative</b> to the <b>evaporation</b> capacity of the dryer, Ws/Wmax (15 to 100 %). Higher accumulation rate values were obtained with the atomizer placed {{at the bottom of the}} bed. In this configuration, the accumulation rate increases with the increase in the Ws/Wmax ratio.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} weather-related moods and feelings on the Australian stock market over the period 1958 to 2005. Eleven daily weather elements (precipitation, <b>evaporation,</b> <b>relative</b> humidity, maximum and minimum temperature, average daytime temperature, hours of bright sunshine, and the speed {{and direction of the}} maximum wind gust and the average daytime wind) are included in the analysis, along with daily nominal and real market returns. Non-parametric correlation analysis and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models are employed, supplying strong evidence of sustained inertia and overreaction in market returns, and non-normally distributed, highly interrelated, but stationary, weather conditions. But contrary to earlier findings, the results indicate that the weather has no influence on market returns confirming that Australian investors weather the weather, whether they like it or not...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{what we call}} “Hygrothermal Inspection”. It {{consists in}} {{a first step in}} the way to quantify real water flux across constructions. Theoretical aspects are related to the fact that a wall, affected by rising damp, suctions water that will then evaporate from the surface, towards the internal and external air. This flux increases the humidity ratio of the internal air, mainly in the thin air coat in contact with the wall or pavement. This fact allows us to measure the <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> intensity by means of a thermohygrometer and to map evaporation zones. &# 13; &# 13; Measuring method and results analysis are shown. Different evaporation levels from the walls or pavements are established by means of calculating what we call “Evaporation Intensity Factor (Fi) ”. Some results from several years work on Heritage Buildings are presented. En este artículo se presenta lo que hemos denominado “inspección higrotérmica”, que consiste en un primer paso en el diagnóstico de flujos de agua a través de los elementos constructivos. El fundamento se basa en que un muro afectado por un problema de capilaridad está sometido a una succión con un determinado caudal y esta agua evaporará en la superficie del muro o del suelo, incrementando el contenido en humedad (W) de la lámina de aire en contacto con el paramento. &# 13; &# 13; Se describe el método de inspección y de análisis de los resultados. Se utiliza un termohigrómetro de lectura directa, y las lecturas se hacen siguiendo un protocolo que permite el análisis de variables. &# 13; &# 13; Los niveles de intensidad de los focos se establecen a partir de lo que hemos denominado “Factor de Intensidad de evaporación (Fi) ”.

40|$|This thesis {{details the}} study of N~Z~ 28 nuclei {{obtained}} using the fusion evaporation reactions 19 Ne + 40 Ca at a beam energy of 70 MeV and 24 Mg- 40 Ca at a beam energy of 65 MeV. The 19 Ne data constitute the first tests of a neutron-deficient Radioactive Ion Beam (RIB) for high-spin nuclear spectroscopy. The radioactive Ne beam was supplied by the coupled cyclotrons at the Louvain-la-Neuve facility, Belgium. Emitted gamma-rays were detected by an array of 7 TESSA-style Ge-detectors in the backward hemisphere in two rings. A degree of channel selection was also allowed by identifying evaporated charged particles {{with an array of}} 128 silicon-strip detectors (LEDA array). Background subtraction of radiation from the decay of the beam was achieved using the timing properties of the pulsed beam and through particle detection using the LEDA charged particle array Information on the <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> residue cross-sections was obtained and the problems associated with performing such experiments in a high radioactive background environment are addressed. New information on the high spin states of 58 Ni was obtained using the reaction 40 Ca (24 Mg, alpha 2 p), performed at the ATLAS facility at Argonne National Laboratory. Emitted 7 -rays were detected by high efficiency AYEBALL array which consisted of 18 EUROGAM and TESSA-style Compton suppressed Ge-detectors in four annular rings. Channel selection is demonstrated by use of (a) mass selection using the Argonne Fragment Mass Analyser (FMA), (b) a split anode ionization chamber {{at the back of the}} FMA, and (c) an array of 11 neutron detectors in a ring at forward angles. The effectiveness of using recoil-gated gamma coincidence data for {{the study of}} nuclear structure in neutron-deficient nuclei close to the proton drip-line is shown. The excited states of 58 Ni are compared with OXBASH shell model calculations and the problems associated with forming high angular momentum states in the limited valence space are addressed...|$|E
40|$|The rate of {{evaporation}} {{from the}} Great Salt Lake (GSL) water surface {{is a function of}} local meteorological conditions, the temperature, and the salinity of the water surface. Several factors affect evaporation from free water surfaces. One of these factors is the salinity of the evaporating surface. Previous work studied the hydrology of salt flats and established <b>relative</b> <b>evaporation</b> rates, under natural field conditions, for brines from Bonneville (GSL) containing various amounts of dissolved solids. Other approaches used pan evaporation data to evaluate and quantify the effect of salinity and water chemistry on evaporation. The effect of salinity on evaporation is important for water balance computations and other engineering studies related to terminal lakes of which the GSL is one. The molecular activity of water is reduced as its salinity increases because molecules of dissolved solids interfere with the motion of water molecules. This has the effect of reducing the saturation vapor pressure over a saline water surface. This paper examines the role played by this effect on the GSL evaporation. Analysis of the GSL’s salinity and volume revealed that to a reasonable approximation the total salt load (3, 500 M ton) may be taken as constant. We showed that salinity of the GSL reduces the amount of the saturation vapor pressure of the GSL surface by representing the saturation vapor pressure contours of the north and south arms. The results of this study show that salinity has an impact on the evaporation which is controlled by area and affects the GSL level/volume. As the level of the GSL increases, salinity decreases which directly affects the evaporation by increasing the tendency of the water vapor to escape the water surface to the air. This contribution of salinity towards evaporation will be useful in modeling the Great Salt Lake and thereby contributing to understanding of surface hydrology of the whole system that drains to the GSL. Moreover, adding the lake salinity effect in the modeling of the Great Salt Lake system hydrology would improve, and enhance knowledge of interactions between hydrologic processes...|$|E
5000|$|Incubation can {{successfully}} occur artificially in machines {{that provide the}} correct, controlled environment for the developing chick. The average incubation period for chickens is 21 days but may depend on the temperature and humidity in the incubator. Temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch. Variations of more than 1 °C (1.8 °F) from the optimum temperature of [...] will reduce hatch rates. Humidity is also important because {{the rate at which}} eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient <b>relative</b> humidity. <b>Evaporation</b> can be assessed by candling, to view the size of the air sac, or by measuring weight loss. Relative humidity should be increased to around 70% in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell. Lower humidity is usual in the first 18 days to ensure adequate evaporation. The position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates. For best results, eggs should be placed with the pointed ends down and turned regularly (at least three times per day) until one to three days before hatching. If the eggs aren't turned, the embryo inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects. Adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the embryo with oxygen. Older eggs require increased ventilation.|$|R
40|$|The {{behavioural}} finance literature posits {{a link between}} the weather and equity markets via investor moods. This paper examines the impact of weather on the Australian stock market over the period 1958 - 2005. A regression-based approach is employed where daily market returns on the Australian Securities Exchange's All Ordinaries Price Index are regressed against eight daily weather observations (precipitation, <b>evaporation,</b> <b>relative</b> humidity, maximum and minimum temperatures, hours of bright sunshine, and the speed and direction of the maximum wind gust) at Sydney's Observatory Hill and Airport meteorological stations. Consistent with studies elsewhere including the Australian market, the results indicate that the weather has absolutely no influence on market returns. Some directions for future research that may help address some of the deficiencies found in this intriguing body of work are provided. Copyright (c) 2009 The Economic Society of Australia. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{correlation}} and {{regression analysis}} of mustard aphid, Lipaphis erysimi vis-à-vis abiotic {{as well as}} biotic factors on Indian mustard, Brassica juncea were studied with respect to three different sowing dates. The impact of abiotic factors i. e. maximum and minimum temperature and sunshine were acted in reducing L. erysimi population to an extent of 35. 63, 15. 14 and 4. 83 %, respectively on early shown B. juncea (October 25). Whereas, on late (November 10 and 25) seeded cultivars, the maximum temperature, maximum <b>relative</b> humidity and <b>evaporation</b> are the key factors responsible in reducing the population of 3. 06, 5. 00 and 1. 74 %, respectively. On evaluation of biotic factors, L. erysimi population exhibited a positive correlation with C. septempunctata, C. transversalis, M. sexmaculatus and I. scutellaris. The information congregated on correlation and regression analysis could be useful to predict the population of Lipaphis erysimi {{at any given time}} and also to develop effective control measures to avoid the high yield loss Indian mustard...|$|R
