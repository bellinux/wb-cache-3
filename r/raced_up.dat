25|$|There were {{a number}} of driver changes prior to the event, Darryl O'Young left Special Tuning Racing and later {{returned}} to bamboo-engineering. His replacement at STR was German racing driver and former FIA GT1 World Championship team owner René Münnich. Masaki Kano joined Liqui Moly Team Engstler for his home event, driving a naturally aspirated BMW 320si. Fellow Japanese racer Hiroki Yoshimoto joined Tuenti Racing Team for the event, driving the SUNRED SR León 1.6T <b>raced</b> <b>up</b> until the last event by Tiago Monteiro.|$|E
25|$|The old rivalry ran hot as Moore's and Irving's sternwheelers <b>raced</b> <b>up</b> {{and down}} the Fraser, {{competing}} for passengers. To compete with Moore, Irving built a new sternwheeler in 1881, the $80,000 Elizabeth J Irving, which on its second trip to Yale, raced Moore's Western Slope and, midway through the race, caught on fire and was soon reduced to a charred wreck, resulting {{in the deaths of}} four First Nations crewmen, two horses and two cows. The loss was a tremendous blow to John Irving, who had just allowed the vessel's insurance to expire a week earlier.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} meet this Union threat, Longstreet {{developed}} a plan, whereby he would command the gap from the high ground on either side and then outflank the Union position on the eastern ridge. The 9th Georgia from Col. George T. Anderson's brigade was sent to Chapman's Mill {{on the east side}} of the gap to repulse a Federal attack by the 11th Pennsylvania, who ironically, to reach the gap, had to remove the trees felled by Wyndham earlier that morning. The impediment allowed Anderson to send half of his brigade up to the slope to the north of the gap to occupy the high ground while still having sufficient men to repulse the 11th Pennsylvania. To the south of the gap, the 2nd and 20th Georgia regiments from Henry Benning's brigade <b>raced</b> <b>up</b> the slopes on the west against the 13th Massachusetts, climbing up the east side. The Georgians won out and drove the 13th Massachusetts back down the steep slopes.|$|E
25|$|Montoya {{dominated}} the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard in Indianapolis on July 26 after starting from second position. It {{was the first}} time in his NASCAR career that he scored bonus points for leading the most laps in the event, however, he was penalized with a drive-through penalty after his last pit stop for speeding in the pit lane. His healthy 5-second advantage over the rest of the field was gone and he ended up finishing 11th. After a pit lane error Montoya slipped back from his top-10 spot at the Sunoco Red Cross Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono Raceway. However, a good pit call meant Montoya pitted prior to a caution which meant he started the next restart in 4th. After slipping back to 5th he made up good ground to pass Bowyer second. He went after leader Hamlin but could not catch him. The second-place finish was his first top 5 of the year and joint best on an oval. At the Carfax 400 at Michigan, Montoya posted the 3rd quickest qualifying time just 0.087 seconds off of the pole. In the race Montoya gradually slipped back and grew frustrated with crew chief Brian Pattie as the car was getting tighter and tighter, Kasey Kahne and Montoya made contact when the 9 car got loose and its splitter touched the 42's right rear tire. The contact resulted in Montoya's right rear going flat and he lost a lap on pit road fixing the minor body damage. However he shortly got the lucky dog and <b>raced</b> <b>up</b> to 20th before dropping back to 23rd, Montoya gained 4 positions on the last lap as others ran out of fuel, resulting in a 19th-place finish which at least kept Juan 7th in points.|$|E
25|$|He {{started the}} 2016 in February racing in the World Series of Asphalt Stock Car Racing at New Smyrna, a week-long series of racing in the Speedweeks. Majeski {{finished}} second in the first night and won the second night. He won the final night for his third win and the Speedweeks division title. He followed the series by racing in another southern race; he quickly went from a seventh place start to the lead as he dominated to win the Rattler 250 race at South Alabama Speedway. Speed51.com rated Majeski as its #1 Short Track Draft pick in May 2016. That month he won the first race of the ARCA Midwest Tour, the Joe Shear Memorial at Madison International Speedway, over Johnny Sauter. In May, he joined Roush Fenway Racing's driver development program. He was one of eleven drivers named to the NASCAR Next 2016–2017 class on the following day. In June 2016, Majeski made his first ARCA start in the No. 17 Roulo Brothers Racing car. He had the fastest time in practice, started seventh, <b>raced</b> <b>up</b> to second, and finished fourth. For the season, Majeski won 9 of 10 races at LaCrosse plus had several high finishes at Madison. Majeski noticed that he was high in the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series national points in August despite not intentionally racing for any track's points championship. The driver's top 18 finishes determine their standings. He had 17 starts, so he made a late season decision to try for the national title. He started double features at Elko Speedway and climbed to tenth in the standings. On the following weekend he won the another feature at Madison for his 13th NASCAR weekly win of the season to climb to third in the standings. He raced more at Elko and Rockford Speedway but finished third in the final points. Majeski capped off the season by winning the Oktoberfest main event at La Crosse to earn his third consecutive ARCA Midwest Tour championship. He returned to New Smyrna Speedway and qualified on the pole position for the Governor's Cup. He fell nearly two laps down during the race and came back to win the race for the second consecutive year.|$|E

[...] A {{newspaper}} account recalls the play, [...] "There leaped a streak of Gold and Black.

Commodores mowed down a path as he fought his way into the clear. On he <b>raced</b> <b>up</b> the sideline, 50, 60, 70, 80 yards to Virginia's 15, where his injured ankle could no longer outdistance Virginia's defense. A tackler threw him to earth. [...] The official called the play back. [...] Both teams were off-side. The greatest run of the season went for naught. There was time for one more play. [...] Rinehart was stopped short of the goal, at the 4-yard line, by Godchaux, Floyd, Goar, and Baker." [...] Offensive standouts for Vanderbilt were captain Red Floyd and Doc Kuhn.|$|E
