500|$|Self-propelled [...] "steam railmotors" [...] {{were first}} used on 12 October 1903 between [...] and {{within five years}} 100 had been constructed. These trains had special <b>retractable</b> <b>steps</b> {{that could be used}} at {{stations}} with lower platforms than was usual in England. The railmotors proved so successful on many routes that they had to be supplemented by trailer cars with driving controls, the first of which entered service at the end of 1904. From the following year a number of small locomotives were fitted so that they could work with these trailers, the combined sets becoming known as [...] "autotrains" [...] and eventually replacing the steam rail motors. Diesel railcars were introduced in 1934. Some railcars were fully streamlined, some had buffet counters for long-distance services, and others were purely for parcels services.|$|E
50|$|Following the 2009 City Centre Track Upgrade Project, {{all other}} Metrolink street-level {{stops in the}} City Zone were rebuilt to full {{platform}} height. This change was carried out to remove the need for <b>retractable</b> <b>steps,</b> which were proving technically problematic (the new fleet of M5000 trams had been built without <b>retractable</b> <b>steps).</b> The new platforms can also accommodate double-length vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|Sapsan trainsets, {{which need}} to be {{modified}} including <b>retractable</b> <b>steps</b> for low platforms and main transformers for AC overhead lines ...|$|E
5000|$|Some recent vehicle {{designs for}} {{continental}} Europe, {{such as the}} [...] "Lint" [...] and [...] "Talent" [...] vehicles, also feature a tumblehome profile, which in some vehicles leads {{to the need for}} a <b>retractable</b> <b>step</b> {{to bridge the gap between}} vehicle floor and station platforms. The operation time of these steps, which must be fully extended before the sliding doors may be opened, can be observed to increase the train waiting time ("dwell time") at stations, compared to vehicles without such steps.|$|R
50|$|The 190/195 has flat sprung-steel {{landing gear}} legs derived from Cessna's {{purchase}} of the rights to Steve Wittman's Big X. Many have been equipped with swiveling crosswind landing gear which allows landing with up to 15 degrees of crab. While the crosswind gear simplifies the actual landing, it makes the aircraft difficult to handle on the ground. The 195 {{is equipped with a}} <b>retractable</b> <b>step</b> that extends when the cabin door is opened, although some have been modified to make the step a fixed unit.|$|R
5000|$|The Sm6 is {{equipped}} {{to operate on}} both the Finnish and the Russian railway networks. The units have dual-voltage electrical equipment able to use both the Finnish 25 kV 50 Hz alternating current and the Russian 3 kV direct current electrification. The wheelsets are built to run at over 200 km/h speeds on both the Finnish [...] and the nominally slightly narrower Russian [...] gauge, and the doors are equipped with a <b>retractable</b> <b>step</b> to make boarding from both Finnish 550 mm high and Russian 1100 mm high platforms easy. The units are equipped for both the Finnish and Russian railway technical systems, which differ substantially.|$|R
5000|$|The second-batch {{series will}} be a {{bodyshell}} width of 3.2m for both power cars and passenger cars, and track gauge will be 1520mm fixed gauge and 1520mm-1676mm variable gauge. This series will also have 760mm train floor, but have <b>retractable</b> <b>steps</b> for 200mm and 550mm platforms. This series {{will be a}}ble to run in Russia, Belarus, Lithuania, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and India. (the latter 2 will have 1520-1676 variable gauge only) ...|$|E
50|$|On 19 December 2011, a â‚¬600 million {{order for}} an {{additional}} twenty trainsets including eight EVS2 sets was signed {{in order to facilitate}} an increased number of services on existing lines and the expansion of new service elsewhere in the system. The second-batch EVS1 sets (trainsets 9-20) will be same details as the first-batch EVS1 sets, but the second-batch EVS2 sets (trainsets 21 onward) will have <b>retractable</b> <b>steps</b> to suit for low platforms, unlike the first-batch EVS2 sets.|$|E
50|$|Fifteen tenders were received, and a joint tender from Hurst, Nelson & Co. Ltd and R & W Hawthorn, Leslie & Co. Ltd was {{accepted}} and the vehicle was delivered in early 1907. This {{was the largest}} steam rail motor ever {{to run in the}} UK. it was 76ft 10in long, and the bodywork was metal, that covering the engine fashioned to match the carriage. <b>Retractable</b> <b>steps</b> were fitted under each of the four recessed passenger doors, although the steps were later fixed in position.|$|E
50|$|Winfield Scott Stratton ordered streetcars for the Colorado Springs & Suburban Railway in 1901. It was {{the first}} set of cars {{purchased}} by Stratton and they were outfitted with safety features, like the <b>retractable</b> Narragansett <b>steps,</b> <b>retractable</b> windows that could be adjusted in transit, and had separate non-smoking and smoking sections. It was a step in the transition from wood to steel framed cars and used the Brill convertible design. Colorado Springs & Interurban Railway (CS&IR) Streetcar No. 48, the only remaining streetcar from that order, is listed on the Colorado State Register of Historic Properties.|$|R
25|$|The Twin Bonanza is an {{all-metal}} low-wing cantilever cabin monoplane initially {{powered by}} two wing-mounted Lycoming GO-435 piston engines {{each with a}} wooden two-bladed propeller. The cabin has room for six people on bench seats, three {{in the front and}} three in the rear accessed by a side door on the right side. To gain access to the door a <b>retractable</b> three-tread <b>steps</b> is used. The Twin Bonanza has a tricycle landing gear with the nose wheel retracting rearwards and the main landing gears retracting partially into the engine nacelles, this leaves the tire exposed to assist {{in the event of a}} wheels-up landing.|$|R
2500|$|LeRoy LoPresti, {{a former}} Grumman engineer, and {{president}} of the Island Aircraft Corporation, designed the Spectra in 1969 by [...] as a technology demonstrator that aimed at new levels of versatility, performance and safety in a small amphibian aircraft. The two-seat Spectra featured a unique configuration in mounting its piston engine in a nacelle on the vertical T-tail. This engineering decision led to less drag compared to a separate pylon and nacelle as well moving the engine and propellor above the spray generated in water operation. The streamlined fuselage design also incorporated a <b>retractable</b> hull <b>step</b> that dramatically reduced the drag penalties of contemporary amphibian designs.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} opened for {{passengers}} on 3 June 1912 and ceased on 10 September 1951. The passenger service was originally {{operated by a}} Hughes-designed 'railmotor' which was fitted with vacuum-operated <b>retractable</b> <b>steps,</b> thus saving on platform building. At first, trains were operated {{on behalf of the}} DVR by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway; when that company amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922, the combined organisation (also known as the London and North Western Railway) absorbed the DVR on the same day.|$|E
50|$|The last high-floor {{articulated}} trams {{to enter}} the fleet were the Type E2 vehicles, which were built under licence from DUEWAG, together with matching type c5 trailer cars; they entered service on 28 August 1978 on Line 6, and remain in service today. This type {{was the first to}} be fitted with exits featuring <b>retractable</b> <b>steps</b> to improve comfort when entering and alighting. Additionally, the tramcar design was moderized, and the safety features of the technical equipment were considerably improved. A total 98 cars of this type were produced by Simmering-Graz-Pauker, and 24 by Bombardier.|$|E
5000|$|The {{deployment}} of the Class 430 trains was delayed in July 2013 after several failures of the doors and <b>retractable</b> <b>steps.</b> These problems, along with unrelated signal failures, resulted in widespread delays on the S-Bahn system, especially on the S1, S2, and S3 lines. [...] It was decided that the retractable step feature would be disabled and Class 430 trains will be gradually introduced beginning on December 15, 2013. [...] By April 2014, 36 of the 430 train sets were in service with the S1 line completely converted.|$|E

5000|$|In 1926, Cadillac {{began the}} {{development}} of a new, [...] "multi-cylinder" [...] car. A customer requirement was seen for a car powered by an engine simultaneously more powerful and smoother than any other available. Development proceeded in great secrecy over the next few years; a number of prototype cars were built and tested as the new engine was developed, {{while at the same time}} Cadillac chief Larry Fisher and GM's stylist Harley Earl toured Europe in search of inspiration from Europe's finest coachbuilders. Unlike many builders of luxury cars, who sold bare chassis to be clothed by outside coachbuilding firms, General Motors had purchased the coachbuilders Fleetwood Metal Body and Fisher Body to keep all the business in-house. Bare Cadillac chassis could be purchased if a buyer insisted, but the intention was that few would need to do so. One Cadillac dealer in England, namely Lendrum & Hartman, ordered at least two such chassis in even rarer right hand drive (RHD) configuration and had Vanden Plas (Belgium) build first an elegant limousine-landaulet (engine #702297), then a sports sedan with unusual cycle fenders and <b>retractable</b> <b>step</b> plates in lieu of running boards (engine #702298, which was successfully shown in various Concours d'Elegance events in Europe before being bought by the young Nawab of Bahawalpur); both these cars have survived. A third RHD chassis was ordered by the Indian Maharaja of Orccha (Bhopal) and sent to Farina in Italy, in July 1931, for a boat tail body (engine between #703136 and #703152).|$|R
5000|$|For 1965, the van {{remained}} largely unchanged. The grille openings were widened, and received one additional slot {{just above the}} bumper to increase cooling. Seat belts were added.The exciting news for the 1965 model year was {{the introduction of the}} Chevy Sportvan and GMC Handi-Bus. Sportvan was a passenger friendly van with windows molded into the van body. A <b>retractable</b> rear courtesy <b>step</b> for the passenger side doors was used on the Sportvan.The 194 6-cylinder engine was now standard equipment, with an available 'Hi-Torque' 140 hp (100 kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder ...|$|R
5000|$|This system {{encouraged}} {{the thought of}} providing low-cost stopping places without station facilities; <b>retractable</b> <b>steps</b> would be provided on the coaches to enable passengers to climb in and out. The [...] "platform" [...] was simply a short area of levelled clinker at rail level, on the up {{side of the line}} in each case. The idea was considered feasible, and was implemented from 20 November 1922, when Fen Ditton, Exning Road, and Mildenhall Golf Links halts were opened. (The last named was renamed shown Worlington Golf Links Halt from 1 January 1923.) ...|$|E
50|$|An open car, the Lincoln was {{equipped}} {{with an assortment of}} tops, including a snap-together bubble top, a black cover for the bubble, a formal rear top and a stainless steel forward section (none of which were bulletproof). It also featured two-way radio telephones and <b>retractable</b> <b>steps</b> and grab-handles for Secret Service agents. No armor plate was added to the bodywork, but the undercarriage and all suspension components were strengthened. A hydraulically-lifted rear seat was fitted. At the time of the assassination, the Lincoln had been fitted with a 1962-model front clip (fenders, hood, grille and bumper assemblies).|$|E
50|$|The S2 line {{uses the}} NDJ3 DMU train marked Hexie Changcheng Hao in a seven-car {{push-pull}} configuration (L+7T+L). Accommodation comes in 'soft-seat' class {{only with a}} 2+2 (first class) or 3+2 (second class) layout. The seats were reversible, but that feature has been removed. Between Nankou and Badaling stations, the train makes a reversal at a switch-back junction. Although all stations are equipped with high-level platforms, trains are equipped with <b>retractable</b> <b>steps</b> and can also serve low-level platforms. On-board facilities include air-conditioning and heating, toilets, hot-water dispensers and a cafe-bar selling tea, coffee, soft drinks, beer and snacks. Smoking is not permitted on the train.|$|E
40|$|A {{low-speed}} wind-tunnel {{investigation was}} made to determine the lateral control characteristics {{of a series of}} untapered low-aspect-ratio wings. Sealed flap ailerons of various spans and spanwise locations were investigated on unswept wings of aspect ratios 1. 13, 1. 13, 4. 13, and 6. 13; and various projections of 0. 60 -semispan retractable ailerons were investigated on the unsweptback wings of aspect ratios 1. 13, 2. 13, and 4. 13 and on a 45 degree sweptback wing. The retractable ailerons investigated on the unswept wings spanned the outboard stations of each wing; whereas the plain and <b>stepped</b> <b>retractable</b> ailerons investigated on the sweptback wing were located at various spanwise stations. Design charts based on experimental results are presented for estimating the flap aileron effectiveness for low-aspect-ratio, untapered, unswept...|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} opened by the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway in 1933 {{to serve the}} {{increasing}} numbers of holidaymakers who were visiting the Norfolk Broads and coastal beaches within reach of the village of Sutton. This attempt to increase revenue on the line was, however, short-lived as the Halt failed to survive its first summer, possibly due to its location on the northern extremity of the Broads. The single station platform was very basic in design, consisting {{of no more than}} a few sleepers at ground level, with passengers alighting with the aid of a set of <b>retractable</b> <b>steps</b> leading down from the Sentinel Railcar which called at the tourist halts on the line.|$|E
50|$|In 1905 the GWR {{introduced}} its steam railmotors {{as a response}} to the rising threat of motor bus competition. These were single passenger coaches incorporating a small steam locomotive within the body at one end; cheaper than a full locomotive, they saved time at terminals by not needing to run round. They were equipped with <b>retractable</b> <b>steps</b> and were able to make calls at places with no platform, or only a very low one. They were operated between Dorchester and Weymouth, and new halts were opened for them at Upwey Wishing Well Halt, Came Bridge Halt and Radipole Halt. Upwey Wishing Well Halt was opened on 28 May 1905, and the other two on 1 July 1905. Came Bridge was renamed Monkton and Came Bridge (Golf Links) Halt on 1 October 1905.|$|E
50|$|Internally, the {{passenger}} {{section of the}} coach {{is divided into two}} open saloons - originally for 'smoking' and 'non-smoking' - with a lobby in the middle separating the two. There is usually a small guard's and luggage compartment at the 'loco' (non-driving) end of the coach. The seating layout is similar to the lower deck of a modern-day bus, with a mixture of normal seating and inwards-facing bench seats. Passengers access the coach via the lobby. The coach is equipped with <b>retractable</b> <b>steps,</b> which are extended if the train stops at rural 'halts' with either low or non-existent platforms, and which fold-in tight against the coach underframe to keep them clear of lineside obstructions when the train is moving. These steps are controlled by the guard using levers in the lobby.|$|E
5000|$|The first T-68s entered {{service on}} 6 April 1992. Initially 26 (1001-1026) were ordered. Because low-floor tram {{technology}} {{was in its}} infancy at the time Metrolink was in its planning stages, {{and in order to}} be compatible with standard high-floor heavy railway platforms, inherited by Metrolink; the vehicles are high-floor, using the same 900mm platform height as main line trains. In the beginning, several stops in the city centre ( [...] , , [...] and [...] ) had dual height platforms, with one high part and one lower part, because of this, the T-68's were equipped with <b>retractable</b> <b>steps</b> to allow passengers to use the lower section of the platform. The dual height platforms have since been either rebuilt as high level platforms or removed. The T-68's could operate either as single units, or coupled together in pairs.|$|E

5000|$|In 1903 the TVR {{experimented with}} what it {{referred}} to as [...] "motor cars": railmotors, that is single passenger coaches with a small integrated steam engine. Although a crew of three was required, these motor cars enabled a frequent service to be run, calling at low-cost stopping places with minimal facilities. After experimentation on the Penarth branch in 1903, {{it was decided to}} introduce the system more widely: platform level access was decided upon, the alternative of using <b>retractable</b> <b>steps</b> on the motor car to access ground level accommodation having been decided against. On 10 October 1904 a motor car service was introduced on the Nelson line; a new [...] "platform" [...] was opened at Llanfabon Road (Abernant). The platforms were 40 feet long and did not have any shelter. Llanfabon Road platform was extended in 1906, revealing that if there were conventional trains operating, the short motor car platforms were not adequate.|$|E
