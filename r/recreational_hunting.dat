5|$|Hunting {{dolphins}} (at {{the time}} still often incorrectly {{referred to as}} fish or porpoises), primarily using harpoons and firearms, was considered a form of <b>recreational</b> <b>hunting</b> along {{the shores of the}} Gulf of Mexico in Texas in the late 19th and early 20th century. Pleasure dolphin hunting cruises could be booked in Corpus Christi in the 1920s, with a promise to tourists that if no successful dolphin kill was made, the excursion would be free of charge. The brutality of the practice started to spark animal welfare concerns and there is no reference of this practice still occurring in Texas after the Second World War.|$|E

25|$|The two eland {{species are}} now semi-domesticated as their docile dispositions, large {{quantities}} of meat, and resilience in Africa's harsh environments has made them ideal alternatives to cattle in some parts in Africa. In a 2014 comparison between the quality of meat from common eland and cattle, {{it was found that}} the meat from male elands was low-fat and more beneficial for human nutritional health but it lacks the sensory texture and flavor that makes cattle meat so appealing to consumers. In addition to being on farm as exotic lifestock, eland as well as the other species of spiral-horned antelope have also been brought to private game reserves across the planet (in particular parts in North America and Africa) for <b>recreational</b> <b>hunting.</b> Unlike eland however, most of the other species are not as docile or tolerant of humans as they avoid any contact as possible.|$|E

40|$|Predation {{strategies}} {{in response to}} altering prey abundances can dramatically influence the demographic effects of predation. Despite this, predation strategies of humans are rarely incorporated into quantitative assessments of the demographic impacts of humans killing carnivores. This scarcity largely seems {{to be caused by}} a lack of data. In this study, we contrasted predation strategies exhibited by people involved in retaliatory killing and <b>recreational</b> sport <b>hunting</b> of leopards (Panthera pardus) in the Waterberg District Municipality, South Africa. We predicted a specialist predation strategy exemplified by a type II functional response for retaliatory killing, and a generalist strategy exemplified by a type III functional response for <b>recreational</b> sport <b>hunting.</b> We could not distinguish between a type I, a type II, or a type III functional response for retaliatory killing, but the most parsimonious model for <b>recreational</b> sport <b>hunting</b> corresponded to a type I functional response. Kill rates were consistently higher for retaliatory killing than for <b>recreational</b> sport <b>hunting.</b> Our results indicate that retaliatory killing of leopards may have severe demographic consequences for leopard populations, whereas the demographic consequences of <b>recreational</b> sport <b>hunting</b> likely are less dramatic.

2500|$|As an {{isolated}} island, Isle Royale initially had neither wolves nor moose. The moose {{are believed to}} have either swam across Lake Superior from Minnesota in the early 1900s or were stocked on the island by man for the purpose of <b>recreational</b> <b>hunting.</b> [...] In 1949 a pair of wolves crossed an ice bridge from Ontario to the island during a harsh winter. But because only one pair of wolves migrated to the island, they have suffered from severe inbreeding. According to Rolf Peterson, a professor at Michigan Technological University and the lead wolf-moose researcher, [...] "Moose were isolated here 100 years ago. Most of the genes are still here, but they have enough population (to compensate). There are so few wolves that they have lost genetic variability. The scientific dogma suggests that {{they are not going to}} make it." [...] In fact, all of the wolves' DNA on Isle Royale can be traced back to one ancestor. [...] Inbreeding leads to mutations and fitness problems, often accompanied by violent social rejection by other wolves.|$|E

Since 16 sandhill cranes (G. canadensIs) had been mistakenly shot prior to the program, concern was that whooping cranes might also be shot. The Bosque Snow Goose Hunter Training Program was initiated in 1977, consisting of a 1 -hour slide/tape presentatIon and a 10 -minute bird identification test. Modifications to hunt procedures and the requirement of all hunters to attend the hunter training program resulted in zero shooting incidents regarding whooping cranes in a 12 -year period. Only 4 incidents were recorded regarding other non-target species violations in the same period...|$|R
