40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} pertaining to the mechanical properties, solidification and segregation effects in nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> has been made. A series of investigations concerning the influence of microsegregation on mechanical properties of :pearlitic, ferritic and austenitic nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> have then been reported. The influence of section size on the tensile and impact properties of cornmercial purity and <b>refined</b> ferritic nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> has been studied. It has been shown. that an increase in section caused a decrease in impact transition temperature of the commercial purity material without greatly affecting the impact transition temperature of the purer material. This effect has been related to increased amounts of segregation effects such as cell boundary carbides in heavier sections of the commercial purity material. Microsegregation studies on the materials used in this thesis have been carried out using an electron probe microanalyser. This technique has shown that concentrations of chromium and manganese and depletions of nickel and silicon occurred at eutectic cell boundaries in nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> and were often associated with brittle carbides in these areas. These effects {{have been shown to be}} more prevalent in heavier sections. The nature of segregation during the solidification of nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> has been studied by quenching samples of nodular iron during the solidification process. Micro-analysis of such samples has shown that segregation of manganese and chromium occurs by a gradual build-up of these elements at the solid/liquid interface. The microstructures of the quenched specimens revealed carbide filaments connecting graphite nodules and areas of quenched liquid. These filaments have been used as evidence for a revised hypothesis for the solidification of nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> by a liquid diffusion mechanism. A similar series of experiments has been carried out on two high nickel austenitic irons containing 0. 5 per cent manganese and 4 per cent manganese respectively. In both these materials a decrease in elongation was experienced with increasing section. This effect was more drastic in the 4 per cent manganese material which also contained much greater amounts of cell boundary carbide in heavy sections. Micro-analysis of samples of the 4 per cent manganese material quenched during solidification revealed that manganese concentrated in the liquid and that nickel concentrated in the solid during solidification. No segregation of silicon occurred in this material. Carbide filaments appeared in the microstructures of these specimens. A discussion of all the above effects in terms of current concepts is included...|$|R
