40|$|Introduction In molding {{and casting}} {{manufacturing}} processes, molten raw material is shaped in molds {{from which the}} resulting part must be removed after solidification.

We propose the use of programmable graphics hardware to test the castability and facilitate computer aided design of such parts. 2 Determining castability in a direction A part is castable in a given direction if and only if, when projected orthographically on a plane normal to that direction, there is no overlap between faces whose normals subtend an angle less than 90 with the positive casting direction.

40|$|Abstract In {{this chapter}} we review {{the use of}} nanoimprint {{lithography}} and its derivative soft-lithography techniques for the fabrication of functional photonic crystals. Nanoimprint is a viable, scalable, and cost-effective solution for large area patterning.

These advancements generated increasing interest in the use of nanoimprint lithography for the fabrication of photonic structures for light man-agement in optoelectronic devices. After describing standard nanoimprint lithog-raphy and its derivative soft-lithography methods, we briefly discuss nanoimprint capabilities and prospects in photonic applications.

METHODS: We developed a model of peritonitis in rats using cecal ligation (CLP) against a 2 -mm diameter <b>rigid</b> <b>mold</b> and puncture. Two experiments were performed: determination of seven-day lethality; and analysis of white cell counts, blood cultures and cytokines (Interleukin- 1 beta, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha and IL- 6). The animals were divided into four groups: I - Sham surgery; II - CLP; III - CLP + Videolaparoscopy; and IV- CLP + Laparotomy. RESULTS: Seven-day lethality was 0 % in group I, 80 % in the group II (p< 0. 05), 60 % in group III, and 20 % in group IV. There was {{a significant reduction in}} leukocyte counts and higher levels of serum IL- 1 beta, TNF-alpha and IL- 6 in the group II compared to controls.

Holes are {{generally}} obtained through drilling operations; {{this causes a}} property decrease for polymer composites reinforced by fibers, brought about by damage due to fiber continuity interruption, and to delamination between the laminate layers.

40|$|Hot {{embossing}} is a {{compression molding}} technique used for high replication accuracy of small features. One {{of the most}} sensitive phases of the process is the de-embossing stage during which the patterned part has to be demolded. In this paper, the demolding stage is considered as a frictional contact problem between a <b>rigid</b> <b>mold</b> insert and a viscoelastic polymer sheet as it deforms and cools inside a mold under an applied force. The contact is modeled with a modified Coulomb's law of dry friction while a generalized Maxwell model is {{used to describe the}} polymer behavior during embossing, cooling and de-embossing stages. The heat transfer between the mold insert and the patterned polymer sheet is solved through a domain decomposition method. A finite element approximation based on a penalized technique is proposed and analyzed. The purpose of this modeling approach is to predict dimensional stability and residual shape of microcomponenets in the hot embossing process. Such a prediction will allow one to assign appropriate processing conditions that minimize geometrical imperfections and increase replication accuracy. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Rotary {{punching}} is a {{sheet metal}} blanking process which utilizes shearing tools fixed {{to a pair}} of rollers. The polyurethane pad is adopted as the die instead of <b>rigid</b> <b>mold</b> because it has the advantages of wide hardness range and high load-bear capacity. Due to the application of polyurethane pad, the surrounding region adjacent to the pierced hole will occur to plastically deform and deflect, which greatly differs from that in the conventional blanking. In this paper, the effects of blank material and thickness, polyurethane hardness, punch penetration depth on deformation behavior were mathematically analyzed and modeled, and then a series of experiments through varying process parameters were conducted to validate the relationship between process parameters and product quality. The degree of sample deflection was exactly measured by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results show that the deformed area varies with different blank elongations and increases with increasing blank thickness for a given material. When polyurethane pad with low hardness level is employed, it results in large area deformation and quality degradation. Moreover, the deflection degreearound the hole edge becomes more severe along with punch penetration, but the penetration depth along blank thickness is not in proportion to the amount of punch advancement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} computing a parting line for a mold for a complex mesh model, given a parting direction, and the related problem of removing small undercuts, either pre-existing, or resulting from the parting line. Existing parting line algorithms are unsuitable for use with complex meshes: the faceted nature of such models leads to a parting line which zig-zags or wanders across the surface unde-sirably. Our method computes a smooth parting line which runs through a band of triangles whose normals are approximately perpendicular to the parting direction. We generate a skeleton of this triangle band to find its distinct topological cycles, and to decompose it into simple pieces. After selecting paths making a good cycle, we generate a final smooth parting line by iteratively improving the geometry of this cycle. Compliance in the physical material, and / or modifications to eliminate minor undercuts ensure that such a parting line is practically useful. Note to Practitioners — Molding {{is the process of}} manufacturing a part by shaping a pliable raw material, such as molten plastic or metal, using a <b>rigid</b> <b>mold.</b> The material hardens and sets inside the mold, adopting its shape. To remove the part from the mold without destroying the mold, the mold must be made of multiple pieces. In the simplest case, a two-part mold is used, and these parts are separated in opposite directions. The curves {{on the surface of the}} part where the pieces of the mold meet are called ‘parting lines’. For a manufacturing perspective, a smooth parting line is more applicable than a theoretically correct parting line. We give a novel method to compute such a parting line in this paper.

40|$|The {{residual}} stress and the finished {{shape of a}} casting depend upon the thermal history of the solidification process and, hence, on the thermal boundary conditions at the mold/casting interface. However, the contact resistance at this interface will depend upon the local contact pressure, which itself is affected by thermal distortion of the solidified casting. The thermal and mechanical problems are therefore coupled and must be investigated as a system. This coupled process {{has the potential for}} instability, resulting in both surface and internal cracking of the cast product through nonuniform thermal distortions. In this article, the effects of distortivity and the thickness of the mold are investigated under the simplifying assumption that the casting and the mold materials have zero thermal capacity. This extends earlier works that are restricted to the case of <b>rigid</b> <b>mold.</b> The results document the effect of mold distortivity on the growth of a perturbation in a nominally plane solidification front due to thermomechanical coupling associated with a pressure-dependent thermal contact resistance. The perturbation in a solidification front tends to a maximum value and then decays to zero at larger values of time. The magnitude of this perturbation, in general, increases with the distortivity of the mold. The effect on the contact pressure, however, depends on the thickness of the mold. For small thickness, the mold is flexible and not much pressure is needed to straighten it out. For larger thickness, the stiffness is increased, but the perturbation in contact pressure associated with a given perturbation in heat flux at the mold surface is reduced. These two effects counter each other for highly distortive molds. However, the second overcomes the first, and therefore perturbation grows more slowly for less distortive molds as solidification proceeds. King Saud Universit...|$|R

Even at double this price, HoneySiC would beat NASA's goal of $ 100, 000 per square meter. Cost savings are estimated to be 40 to 100 times that of current mirror technologies. The organic, rich prepreg material has a density of 56 kilograms per cubic meter. A charred carbon-carbon panel (volatile organics burnt off) has a density of 270 kilograms per cubic meter. Therefore, it is estimated that a HoneySiC panel would have a density of no more than 900 kilograms per cubic meter, which is about half that of beryllium and about onethird the density of bulk silicon carbide. It is also estimated that larger mirrors could be produced in a matter of weeks. Each cell is completely uniform, maintaining the shape of the inserted mandrel. Furthermore, the layup creates pressure that insures node bond strength. Each node is a composite laminate using only the inherent resin system to form the bond. This contrasts starkly with the other known method of producing composite honeycomb, in which individual corrugations are formed, cured, and then bonded together in a secondary process. By varying the size of the mandrels within the layup, varying degrees of density can be achieved. Typical sizes are 3 / 8 and 3 / 16 in. (approximately 10 and 5 millimeters). Cell sizes up to 1 in. (approximately 25 millimeters) have been manufactured. Similarly, the shape of the core can be altered for a flexible honeycomb structure...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{inevitable}} {{detachment of}} tendons {{and the loss}} of the forefoot in Chopart and Lisfranc amputations result in equinus and varus of the residual foot. In an insensate foot these deformities can lead to keratotic lesions and ulcerations. The currently available prostheses cannot safely counteract the deforming forces and the resulting complications. Methods: A new below-knee prosthesis was developed, combining a soft socket with a <b>rigid</b> shaft. The <b>mold</b> is taken with the foot in the corrected position. After manufacturing the shaft, the lateral third of the circumference of the shaft is cut away and reattached distally with a hinge, creating a lateral flap. By closing this flap the hindfoot is gently levered from the varus position into valgus. Ten patients (seven amputations at the Chopart-level, three amputations at the Lisfranc-level) wit...|$|R
