40|$|Lymphocyte {{membrane}} rafts contain molecules {{critical for}} immunoreceptor signaling. Here, we <b>report</b> <b>identification</b> {{of a new}} raft-associated adaptor protein LIME (Lck-interacting molecule) expressed predominantly in T lymphocytes. LIME becomes tyrosine phosphorylated after cross-linking of the CD 4 or CD 8 coreceptors. Phospho-LIME associates with the Src family kinase Lck and its negative regulator, Csk. Ectopic expression of LIME in Jurkat T cells results in an increase of Csk in lipid rafts, increased phosphorylation of Lck and higher Ca 2 + response to CD 3 stimulation. Thus, LIME appears {{to be involved in}} regulation of T cell activation by coreceptors...|$|E

Few intracellular mediators or modulators of MuSK actions are known. E 3 ubiquitin ligases may serve this role, because activities of several receptor tyrosine kinases, G-protein-coupled receptors and channels are modulated by ubiquitination.

40|$|Protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatase (PTP) receptor T (PTPRT) is {{the most}} frequently mutated PTP in human cancers. However, the cell signaling pathways regulated by PTPRT {{have not yet been}} elucidated. Here, we <b>report</b> <b>identification</b> of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) as a substrate of PTPRT. Phosphorylation of a tyrosine at amino acid Y 705 is essential for the function of STAT 3, and PTPRT specifically dephosphorylated STAT 3 at this position. Accordingly, overexpression of normal PTPRT in colorectal cancer cells reduced the expression of STAT 3 target genes. These studies illuminate a mechanism regulating the STAT 3 pathway and suggest that this signaling pathway {{plays an important role in}} colorectal tumorigenesis...|$|E

40|$|Lysine propionylation and butyrylation are protein modi-fications {{that were}} {{recently}} identified in histones. The molecular components {{involved in the}} two protein modi-fication pathways are unknown, hindering further func-tional studies.

We used mass spectrometry to map lysine propionylation sites within these three proteins. We also identified the first two in vivo eukaryotic lysine propionyl-transferases, p 300 and CREB-binding protein, and the first eukaryotic depropionylase, Sirt 1. p 300 was able to perform autopropionylation on lysine residues in cells.

40|$|AbstractThe {{secreted}} signaling protein Wingless {{acts as a}} morphogen to pattern the {{imaginal discs}} of Drosophila. Here we <b>report</b> <b>identification</b> of a secreted repressor of Wingless activity, which we call Notum. Loss of Notum function leads to increased Wingless activity by altering {{the shape of the}} Wingless protein gradient. When overexpressed, Notum blocks Wingless activity. Notum encodes a member of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily, with similarity to pectin acetylesterases. We present evidence that Notum influences Wingless protein distribution by modifying the heparan sulfate proteoglycans Dally-like and Dally. High levels of Wingless signaling induce Notum expression. Thus, Wingless contributes to shaping its own gradient by regulating expression of a protein that modifies its interaction with cell surface proteoglycans...|$|E
