50|$|<b>Recoated</b> splices {{can usually}} be coiled into a tight radius because the <b>recoated</b> fiber section is just as {{flexible}} as the original polymer coating. <b>Recoats</b> are e.g. employed in the assembly of undersea optical fiber cables where high fusion splice strength is already necessitated by stringent reliability requirements. Another reason optical fiber <b>recoating</b> is attractive in submarine communications cabling is that the cross section of <b>recoated</b> fibers matches that of the original fiber.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Recoating</b> is {{the process}} of {{restoring}} the primary coating to stripped optical fiber sections after fusion splicing. In the <b>recoating</b> process, the spliced fiber is restored to its original shape and strength, using a recoater. The stripped fiber section is <b>recoated</b> by filling a <b>recoating</b> resin, usually acrylate into transparent moulds. The resin is then cured with UV light. It is often desirable to perform a proof-test after <b>recoating,</b> to ensure that the splice is strong enough to survive handling, packaging and extended use.|$|R

40|$|Assembly of the {{rotavirus}} outer capsid is {{the final}} step of a complex pathway. In vivo, the later steps include a maturational membrane penetration that {{is dependent on the}} scaffolding activity of a viral nonstructural protein. In vitro, simply adding the recombinant outer capsid proteins VP 4 and VP 7 to authentic double-layered rotavirus subviral particles (DLPs) in the presence of calcium and acidic pH increases infectivity by a factor of up to 107, yielding particles as infectious as authentic purified virions. VP 4 must be added before VP 7 for high-level infectivity. Steep dependence of infectious <b>recoating</b> on VP 4 concentration suggests that VP 4 -VP 4 interactions, probably oligomerization, precede VP 4 binding to particles. Trypsin sensitivity analysis identifies two populations of VP 4 associated with <b>recoated</b> particles: properly mounted VP 4 that can be specifically primed by trypsin, and nonspecifically associated VP 4 that is degraded by trypsin. A full complement of properly assembled VP 4 is not required for efficient infectivity. Minimal dependence of <b>recoating</b> on VP 7 concentration suggests that VP 7 binds DLPs with high affinity. The parameters for efficient <b>recoating</b> and the characterization of <b>recoated</b> particles suggest a model in which, after a relatively weak interaction between oligomeric VP 4 and DLPs, VP 7 binds the particles and locks VP 4 in place. <b>Recoating</b> will allow the use of infectious modified rotavirus particles to explore rotavirus assembly and cell entry and could lead to practical applications in novel immunization strategies...|$|R

5000|$|There may be {{a maximum}} time frame within which a topcoat should be applied over the primer after the primer dries, {{in order to achieve}} maximum performance. Depending on the primer, the next coat of paint should be applied as quickly as 24 hours or as long as two weeks.

If topcoating is applied after the suggested timeframe, consider using a [...] "self priming" [...] topcoat. For definitive answers on recommended repainting timeframe, check the primer label/website, or contact the manufacturer directly. <b>Recoat</b> timeframe is most likely a more critical factor in exterior application because of the more extreme climatic exposure.|$|E

Multiple laboratory testing methodologies exist to study this hot corrosion, and these can be affected by a range of variables. This paper investigated the impact of varying deposit <b>recoat</b> cycle length when using the ‘deposit recoat’ testing method. CMSX- 4 samples were exposed to simulated type II (pitting) hot corrosion conditions, with the same overall deposit load (averaged across the total exposure run), but different deposit <b>recoat</b> cycles. Post-exposure, samples underwent dimensional metrology analysis to compare metal loss resulting from different deposit <b>recoat</b> cycle lengths. Results for CMSX- 4 suggest very small differences in corrosion losses, indicating CMSX- 4 hot corrosion datasets obtained from deposit <b>recoat</b> experiments with different deposit <b>recoat</b> cycle lengths can be compared with confidence...|$|E

40|$|Experiments in {{cell-free}} {{systems have}} demonstrated that the VP 5 * cleavage fragment of the rotavirus spike protein, VP 4, undergoes a foldback rearrangement that translocates three clustered hydrophobic loops {{from one end of}} the molecule to the other. This conformational change resembles the foldback rearrangements of enveloped virus fusion proteins. By <b>recoating</b> rotavirus subviral particles with recombinant VP 4 and VP 7, we tested the effects on cell entry of substituting hydrophilic for hydrophobic residues in the clustered VP 5 * loops. Several of these mutations decreased the infectivity of <b>recoated</b> particles without preventing either <b>recoating</b> or folding back. In particular, the V 391 D mutant had a diminished capacity to interact with liposomes when triggered to fold back by serial protease digestion in solution, and particles <b>recoated</b> with this mutant VP 4 were 10, 000 -fold less infectious than particles <b>recoated</b> with wild-type VP 4. Particles with V 391 D mutant VP 4 attached normally to cells and internalized efficiently, but they failed in the permeabilization step that allows coentry of the toxin -sarcin. These findings indicate that the hydrophobicity of the VP 5 * apex is required for membrane disruption during rotavirus cell entry. Cell entry by nonenveloped viruses requires disruption or perforation of a membrane and translocation of a modified virion or an infectious genome into the cytosol (30). A variet...|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} approach for the thermal design of high-power-fiber laser components is presented. The modular {{structure of the}} model allows adaption to different fiber designs and gives insight into the governing parameters of the heat transport. Furthermore the analysis and analytic optimization of interacting effects of groups of layers is possible with this method and is presented in this work. A previously suggested cooling scheme for a heat load of 120 W/m is analyzed. Applying the analysis to air-clad-fibers is leading to results differing up 40 % from previous works. The FEM-analysis of the cooling of splices shows that the cooling scheme suggested for the active fiber is not sufficient for splices for a fiber resonator in the kW-range.

40|$|A {{sintered}} part’s {{mechanical properties}} are often variable {{dependent on the}} temperature at which it was sintered. Prior research has investigated how predefined process conditions (such as scan speed and laser power) in the ‘Sinter’ software affect built parts, however, little work focuses on other process conditions that can directly affect the temperature distribution in the bed relative to these parts. These conditions are not always controllable in the ‘Sinter’ software. By replacing the scanner {{at the top of}} the Sinterstation 2000 with a thermal imaging camera, an insight into the temperature distribution on the part bed was obtained. A temperature variance of up to 7 °C was found across the bed, as well as a large temperature drop and recovery period on powder layer <b>recoat.</b> This paper explores the possible causes of this variation in the processing of DuraForm™ Polyamide- 12 powder by monitoring and assessing build operations, enabled by replacing the front viewing window with a retro-fitted thermal imaging camera. The part bed was observed and various process conditions analysed including powder <b>recoat,</b> part and feed heaters, and swing gate configuration. On powder <b>recoat,</b> the part bed exhibited a drop in temperature because the fresh layer of powder is at a lower temperature than the powder already present in the part bed. The part bed temperature drop lessens with raised feed bed temperatures however there are limitations. Thermal analysis of the part heater proved that the uneven part bed heat distribution was not linked to the temperature gradient of the part heater. Swing gates were found to minimise hot and cold spots but spend a substantial time oscillating on roller passing...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of high strength and toughness, excellent wear resistance and moderate density makes zirconia-toughened alumina (ZTA) a favorable ceramic, and the foam {{version of it}} may also exhibit excellent properties. Here, ZTA foams were prepared by the polymer sponge replication method. We developed an immersion infiltration approach with simple equipment and operations to fill the hollow struts in as-prepared ZTA foams, and also adopted a multiple <b>recoating</b> method (up to four cycles) to strengthen them. The solid load of the slurry imposed a significant influence on {{the properties of the}} ZTA foams. Immersion infiltration gave ZTA foams an improvement of 1. 5 MPa in compressive strength to 2. 6 MPa at 87 % porosity, only resulting in a moderate reduction of porosity (2 – 3 %). The Weibull modulus of the infiltrated foams was in the range of 6 – 9. The <b>recoating</b> method generated an increase in compression strength to 3. 3 – 11. 4 MPa with the reduced porosity of 58 – 83 %. The <b>recoating</b> cycle dependency of porosity and compression strength is nearly linear.

This membrane is being studied for use in degassing chambers of analytical instruments such as a High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) degassing modules. The level of impregnation of the Teflon® in the carbon matrix affects the diffusion properties which are crucial {{for the performance of}} the membrane. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) characterization techniques were used to measure the outer Teflon® and the inner carbon matrix layer thickness. The outer Teflon® and inner carbon matrix layer thicknesses ranged from 1. 92 to 28. 17 microns and 5. 07 to 41. 70 microns, respectively. Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (EDS) was used to measure the Teflon® fluorine concentration gradient across the composite membrane.

40|$|Mammalian reoviruses, {{prototype}} {{members of}} the Reoviridae family of nonenveloped double-stranded RNA viruses, use at least three proteins—s 1, m 1, and s 3 —to enter host cells. s 1, {{a major determinant of}} cell tropism, mediates viral attachment to cellular receptors. Studies of s 1 functions in reovirus entry have been restricted by the lack of methodologies to produce infectious virions containing engineered mutations in viral proteins. To mitigate this problem, we produced virion-like particles by “recoating ” genome-containing core particles that lacked s 1, m 1, and s 3 with recombinant forms of these proteins in vitro. Image reconstructions from cryoelectron micrographs of the <b>recoated</b> particles revealed that they closely resembled native virions in three-dimensional structure, including features attributable to s 1.

Oxidation {{damage has been}} characterised via mass change data from thermogravimetric analyses at temperatures from 700 to 800 ºC and cyclic oxidation testing at 700 and 750 ºC. Thin oxide scales rich in Cr and Ti {{have been found to}} grow in a parabolic dependence with time. Oxidation rate constants have been correlated with temperature using an Arrhenius equation. Through the use of simplifying assumptions, mass change data have been converted to oxide thickness values. These values have been compared with observed values of oxide scale and the depth of near-surface damage, which have been measured using focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy.
