50|$|The NLIS RFID {{system was}} {{introduced}} in New South Wales on 1 July 2004 and replaced the previous tail tag system for cattle. The approved devices used are the commonly used ear tags or alternatively a <b>rumen</b> <b>bolus.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An ear tag usually {{carries an}} Animal Identification Number (AIN) or code for the animal, or for its herd or flock. Non {{electronic}} ear tags may be simply handwritten {{for the convenience}} of the farmer (these are known as [...] "management tags"). Alternatively this identification number (ID) may be assigned by an organisation, such as the Meat and Livestock Association (MLA), which is a not-for-profit organisation owned by cattle, sheep and goat producers; funded by a levy on livestock sales with Federal Government input. Electronic tags may also show other information about the animal, including other related identification numbers; such as the Property Identiﬁcation Code (PIC) for the properties the animals have been located. In the case of MLA's NLIS the movement of certain species of livestock (primarily cattle, goats and sheep) must be recorded in the online database within 24 hours of the movement; and include the PICs of the properties the animals are travelling between. The National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) of Australia regulations require that all cattle be fitted with a RFID device {{in the form of an}} ear tag or <b>rumen</b> <b>bolus</b> (a cylindrical object placed in the rumen) before movement from the property and that the movement be reported to the NLIS. However, if animals are tagged for internal purposes in a herd or farm, IDs need not be unique in larger scales. The NLIS now also requires sheep and goats to use an ear tag that has the Property Identiﬁcation Code inscribed on it. These ear tags and boluses are complemented by transport documents supplied by vendors that are used for identification and tracking. A similar system is used for cattle in the European Union (EU), each bovine animal having a passport document and tag in each ear carrying the same number (see British Cattle Movement Service). Sheep and goats in the EU have a tag in one or both ears carrying the official number of their flock and also for breeding stock an individual number for each animal; one of these tags (usually the left) must have a RFID chip (or the chip may instead be carried in a <b>rumen</b> <b>bolus</b> or on an anklet).|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} was objected {{to study the}} in vitro rumen fermentability on the processed vegetable waste. The study was accomplished by two experiments. The first {{experiment was}} aimed to select the best processing for vegetable waste. The vegetable wastes from a traditional market in Semarang City were fermented using Lactobacillus bulgaricus and <b>rumen</b> <b>bolus</b> with cassava waste, rice bran, and maize grain as additives. In each combined treatment of innoculant and additive was fermented in anaerob conditon for 0, 1, 2, and 3 weeks, respectively. In each combined treatment of innoculant, additive, and fermentation time was analyzed for its moisture, crude protein, crude fiber, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber content. Among the combined treatments were then selected the best processing for vegetable waste ac-cording {{to the use of}} L. bulgaricus and <b>rumen</b> <b>bolus,</b> respectively. The selection was determined {{on the basis of a}} numerical score for each parameter observed. The results showed that the combination of rice bran of additive and one week of fermentation was the best for fermentation using L. bulgaricus (SSLB). Likewise, the the combination of rice bran of additive and two weeks of fermentation was the best for fermentation using <b>rumen</b> <b>bolus</b> (SSBR). In the second experiment, the processed vegetable wastes from the result of first experiment (SSLB and SSBR) were compared to Pennisetum purpureum (RG), unprocessed vegetable waste from the garbage collecting terminal in Semarang City (SSTPA), and unprocessed vegetable waste from traditional market (SSPT) on the basis of their in vitro rumen fermentability. Parameters of the in vitro rumen fermentability were dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) digestibility, rumen production of VFA and N-NH 3. The test of in vitro rumen fermentability was conducted using cattle rumen liquid and artificial saliva. The results showed that the DM and OM digestibility of RG was lower (P< 0, 05) than that of SSPT, but there was no siginificant different among SSTPA, SSLB, and RG in their DM and OM digestibility. The in vitro rumen VFA production among RG, SSTPA, SSLB, and SSBR were not different significantly. The in vitro rumen VFA production of SSPT was higher (P< 0, 05) than that of RG, SSTPA, SSLB, and SSBR. The in vitro rumen NH 3 production among SSPT, SSLB, and SSBR were not different significantly. The in vitro rumen NH 3 production of RG and SSTPA were lower (P< 0, 05) than that of SSPT, SSLB, and SSBR. The fermen-tation using L. bulgaricus with rice bran for one week was appropriate in processing the vegetable waste. The results could be utilized for further study focusing on the substitution of Pennisetum purpureum with the processed vegetable waste in a ruminant ration.

40|$|The {{readability}} of {{two different}} types of electronic identifiers (EID) were evaluated under pastoral production system in North-Eastern Kenya. Physical verification and reading was done at day 0, and 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 months respectively on a total of 1943 beef cattle of which 934 were tagged using ear button tags and 1009 with <b>rumen</b> <b>boluses.</b> The retention rates were recorded and readability determined using a hand-held reader and subsequently compared using a non parametric survival analysis. The results showed that, <b>rumen</b> <b>boluses</b> were more effective with retention and readability of 100 % after the one-year period. The retention rate for ear button tags deteriorated after day 120 to 94. 6 %. This implied that <b>rumen</b> <b>boluses</b> are safe and tamper-proof and are thus recommended for use in pastoral production systems. When tested within the model Livestock Identification and Traceability System (LITS), the use of RFID identifiers were able to substantially contribute to better record keeping, and proof of credible livestock certification.

40|$|The {{technology}} for electronic identification (ID) of bovines is currently available {{with the advent}} of passive electronic transponders. At issue is the most appropriate method to attach the electronic ID to the animals. The options include an electronic button tag in the ear, an implantable electronic chip in the ear base or an electronic bolus placed in the rumen/reticular via the oesophageal route. • Aseries of experiments which compared different implantation sites for electronic chips found that the most suitable site for implantation was under the scutellar cartridge of the ear. This site gave very good retention values and was also a secure site, however, {{it was not possible to}} palpate the transponder. • The recovery of injectable transponders post slaughter was problematic and as a result due to potential risk of implantable transponder entering the food chain it was not possible to recommend the injectable (implantable route). • Electronic <b>rumen</b> <b>boluses</b> with a specific density less than 2 were rapidly expelled from the rumen, with 100 % expulsion by day 56 following placement in the reticulo-rumen. • <b>Rumen</b> <b>boluses</b> with a specific density of 2. 75 and greater had an annual non reading rate of less than 1 %, however, the loss rate in adult beef cows was greater than in growing and finishing cattle. The reason for this difference was unclear and may be diet related. • Recovery of boluses at slaughter was undertaken in the offal hall and generally the bolus was present in the reticulum and was easily detected by palpating the reticulum. One hundred percent recovery was not achieved in practice, various unforseen events including accidental dislodgment and cutting techniques prevented recovery. • Abolus dispenser with a long connection will facilitate delivery of the bolus directly to the calf’s reticulum. • Electronic failure of transponders in the reticulo-rumen was not a problem and read-failure rate was associated with boluses expelled from the reticulo-rumen. • There was no differences in read-failure rate (or loss rate) between two commercial boluses which were compared in different catgories of cattle. • Electronic button tags from two commercial companies were compared and it was found that any difference between the electronic button ear tags was associated with a defective applicator taggers. • Overall, the animal loss rate for electronic button tags was somewhat higher than that reported for electronic <b>rumen</b> <b>boluses.</b> End of Project Repor...|$|R

40|$|This {{doctorate}} thesis {{provides a}} general background and new research {{findings on the}} electronic identification of ruminants. The first chapter is a literature review on electronic devices used for livestock identification. The other chapters describe experimental work on electronic identification devices, mostly in dairy sheep but also in goats. Chapter 2 deals with {{the effect of the}} presence and permanence time (from few days to 9 years) of four types of ceramic boluses (differing in capsule size, weight and material) used for electronic identification of Sarda sheep in six farms on the reticulum and chemical-physical characteristics of the interface surface. The boluses showed the presence of calcium, manganese, and zinc salts. The long-term permanence of the bolus in situ caused little changes in the mucosa which did not seem to impair the organ function. Chapter 3 comparing traditional and electronic animal identification in dairy sheep farms showed that the electronic identification device was more realiable, effective and efficient than the ear tag and ear tattoo. Chapter 4 studied possible correlations between the presence of <b>rumen</b> <b>bolus</b> and calcium content in blood, during pregnancy and lactation, and in milk in early, mid and late lactation in Sarda sheep.

It was used a double 4 × 4 Latin square experimental design. Intakes of dry matter (DM), organic matter, crude protein, mineral matter, non-fibrous carbohydrates and total digestible nutrients were not influenced {{by the addition of}} CNM, however, intake of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber and total carbohydrates presented a quadratic behavior with the increase of content of lipids in the ration. Apparent digestibility of DM, organic matter, crude protein, NDF, acid detergent fiber and non-fibrous carbohydrates was not influenced by the addition of CNM in the rations; however digestibility of ether extract and total carbohydrates presented quadratic and linear behavior, respectively. It was not observed any significant differences in time spent with feeding and rumination, however, total chewing time was influenced, presenting increasing linear behavior with the levels of CNM. Concerning to intakes of dry matter and NDF per hour, feed efficiency and rumination were not affected by increase on lipid content in the rations.

40|$|The European and {{national}} laws concerning {{the identification and}} registration of livestock are meant to make possible their traceability and facilitate food safety and animal health, especially {{in case of a}} disease outbreak; such rules have also become prerequisites that farmers must meet to obtain single farm payments under the common agricultural policy. Failure to comply with these obligations entails the reduction or exclusion from direct payments.   Act A 7, reports the obligations imposed by the EC Regulation 1760 / 2000 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products;  Act A 8, report the obligations established by the EC Reg. 21 / 2004 establishing a system for the identification and registration of sheep and goats. The project MO. NA. CO. monitored the application of rules for identification and registration of cattle, sheep and goats and their costs. The system of identification and registration of dairy cows resulted well organized with a good level of coordination between the involved actors in both farms. The activities necessary for compliance with rules of identification and registration of cattle are distributed throughout the year, but vary from day to day. The average total cost for annual obligations amounted to € 533. 34 year - 1 while the average cost for individual fulfilment in the monitoring period amounted to € 4. 10.

40|$|Current feeding {{strategies}} for dairy cows focus on meeting the energy requirements for {{high levels of}} milk production. However a major concern is the effect that these feeding regimes might have on rumen pH, which can have harmful effects on the cow and rumen microbial population. Several interventions {{have been used to}} counteract the effects of low rumen pH {{such as the use of}} probiotics e. g. yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). However benefits have been inconclusive due to large individual animal variation in responses to treatment observed. The use of novel monitoring technologies can help assess the effect that different dietary interventions have on performance, rumen pH and rumen health. Data from three on-farm dairy cow trials (Trial 1 standard diet plus yeast; Trial 2 standard diet plus acidotic challenge plus yeast; Trial 3 cows grazing grass plus yeast) was used to evaluate the use of rumination collars (RC), <b>rumen</b> pH <b>boluses,</b> a whole cow dynamic mechanistic simulation model (SM) and the effect that different feeding strategies have on performance rumen pH dynamics and rumination time. No statistically significant differences between Control (no yeast) and Treatment (addition of yeast) diets were observed on any of the parameters measured. The lack of animal response to yeast supplementation observed in the three feeding Trials could be attributed to the stage of lactation, as the cows were passed peak lactation. Comparison of rumination time obtained with the RC and visual observations (obtained directly and from video recordings) suggest that the RC can be used to determine rumination time in housed cows. However its poor performance in grazing environments makes its use not advisable in cows outside at grass. The <b>rumen</b> pH <b>boluses</b> provided detailed and accurate data on circadian rumen pH. Highly varied individual responses to the feeding strategies were observed. This resulted in a diverse degree of risk of individual cows which experienced sub-acute rumen acidosis. The SM was able to accurately predict circadian pH, compared against the data obtained from Trials 1 and 2. The model provided pH values that were in agreement with those obtained with the <b>rumen</b> <b>boluses.</b> The use of new technologies to monitor cows individually could aid in whole-herd management, for example by setting thresholds for rumen pH and rumination time related to individual cow status, and then trigger appropriate interventions...|$|R

Journal of Dairy Science, 88, (9), pp. 3220 - 3230 Key words: rumen, odd-chain fatty acid, microbial colonization, polyester bag technique Sponsorship: DEFRATwo in situ studies {{were conducted to}} examine the use of odd-chain fatty acid profiles to study microbial colonization of freshly ingested herbage in the rumen as well as fatty acid biohydrogenation. In the first study, fresh perennial ryegrass was subjected {{to a range of}} sample preparation methods before incubation in the rumen for 2 or 7 h. In the second study, fresh perennial ryegrass was chopped into 1 -cm lengths and incubated in polyester bags in the rumen for 2, 8, and 24 h. After removal of bags from the rumen, 4 different washing methods, ranging from manual squeezing to machine washing, were applied. Fatty acids were extracted from washed residues and determined, as methyl esters, by gas chromatography. The main oddchain fatty acids (with the exception of anteiso C 15 : 0) were not found in fresh grass and were useful markers of the effects of incubation time, sample preparation method, and washing method on microbial colonization/ contamination. The concentration of these and other odd-chain fatty acids increased with incubation time in both studies. The results indicate rapid and continued microbial colonization of freshly ingested forages, although patterns of odd-chain fatty acids did not reveal any further information about the types of bacteria-colonizing herbage. Principal component, biplot analysis provided a useful overall description of the processes of microbial colonization and degradation of plant fatty acids on fresh herbage incubated in the <b>rumen.</b> <b>Bolus</b> formation during mastication and ingestion results in extensive damage to herbage; none of the techniques (cutting, crushing, and drying/grinding) investigated in this work was able to replicate the effects of bolus formation in the animal. The study provided further evidence of loss of unfermented feed particles through polyester bag pores, especially when feeds are dried and ground. Biohydrogenation of the polyunsaturated fatty acids of fresh herbage was used principally by solid-associated bacteria to enable them to take up high levels of trans- 11 C 18 : 1 and C 18 : 0 fatty acids. Although trans- 11 C 18 : 1 was strongly associated with bacterial markers (odd- and branched-chain fatty acids), its precursor (cis- 9, trans- 11 C 18 : 2) was not associated with bacterial variation, suggesting that its production in the rumen under these conditions was mainly extracellular.

40|$|The Kahne <b>rumen</b> sensor (<b>bolus)</b> is {{a device}} {{developed}} to measure temperature, pressure and pH in non-fistulated animals. This bolus allows real-time {{monitoring of the}} rumen environment, which could help preventing health problems such as rumen acidosis in cows. It is less invasive to use boluses compared to other technologies that measure the ruminal pH (e. g. rumenocentesis). Kahne boluses and transceivers are commercially available in the market. Several studies on the relationships between data recorded by the bolus and actual data recorded by independent devices were conducted. The bolus temperature and pressure were compared with actual temperature and pressure under controlled conditions. The pH drift was studied by comparing the difference between bolus and direct measurement over time. The capture of the data was calculated for each bolus in various experiments to examine the factors affecting the data capture rate of the boluses. Animal to animal variation was studied using boluses {{in a group of}} cows fed and managed under uniform conditions. An animal experiment involving fistulated cows eating two different diets was performed using boluses to monitor the changes of ruminal pH. There was no apparent interruption to normal animal behaviour as a result of using boluses. Regression relationships between bolus measurements and actual data for both temperature and pressure were developed and used for calibration of bolus data. The pH drift was a problem, as the regression relation between the pH difference and the time for one bolus from one experiment could not represent this bolus on other experiment. The data capture rate on the hourly basis ranged from 0 to 100 %, but was usually between 30 to 70 %. The data capture rate was affected by many factors and further studies to identify these factors are needed. A study of animal to animal variation suggests that in a comparison of 2 treatments, a minimum 3 cows per group would be required to detect the standard deviation of 0. 11 for a pH difference of 5 % of the mean (approximately 0. 35 pH units). Seventeen cows per group would be required to detect the standard deviation of 0. 33 for the same difference. The boluses effectively monitored the ruminal pH change in cows easting two different diets and the profile of change of pH was successfully analysed. Feeding 7. 6 kg baleage twice a day cause pH to decrease at 0. 009 pH units per minute during feeding, while offering a similar quantity of grass and hay once a day resulted in a decrease of 0. 0009 pH units per minute during feeding. The beginning of pH increase was about 1 hour following feeding and continuous during resting and rumination. The level of pH increase did not differ significantly for two diets [...] The Kahne devices appear to have advantages compared to other technologies for the measurement of parameters of the rumen environment on a real-time basis. Boluses are especially good at intensively monitoring the temperature, pressure, and pH in the rumen. The major limitations of this technology to be used are the data capture rate and the pH drift. By improving the limitations found in the experiment, the Kahne rumen sensor could become very useful for both scientific research and under commercial conditions for monitoring animal health...|$|R
40|$|ICTs can now {{be found}} in the most {{unlikely}} places. In Botswana´s southern Kweneng and Kgatleng districts, they are even to {{be found in the}} stomachs of more than 135, 000 cattle. The cattle are participants in an initiative of the Ministry of Agriculture called the Livestock Identification Trace-back System (LITS), which aims to ensure that cattle in Botswana can be individually identified and traced throughout their lives. The system has been introduced to enable Botswana to comply with new regulatory procedures required by the European Union, which accounts for 80 to 90 % of Botswana´s beef exports. The regulations, imposed following the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Europe, stipulate that all imports of deboned beef must be traceable from the packing plant back to the individual farms in the country of origin. Thus, exporting countries must set up and maintain a database on the production, distribution, processing and sale of meat products. LITS employs radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to capture data on individual cattle, which is transmitted directly, error-free, to a central database. The database enables Botswana´s meat export agency to obtain EU certification for its beef exports (see elsewhere in this issue), and is a key repository of information for livestock farmers, as well as for state veterinary services and health authorities. LITS is being implemented by AST Botswana and Inala Identification and Control (South Africa). The first phase, completed in 2001, involved the development of the database and the identification of all cattle in two pilot districts. In the second phase the system is being extended, and will eventually be the world´s largest livestock tracking, monitoring and management system using RFID technology, involving an estimated 3 million head of cattle. RFID technology At the core of the system is a bolus containing a transponder that is, with the aid of an applicator, inserted into each animal´s <b>rumen.</b> Each <b>bolus</b> carries a unique ID number and other data that can be read by fixed or portable readers and relayed to the database. Fixed readers, placed at over 300 strategic locations, scan the ID numbers and relay information on, for example, new registrations and disease treatments to 46 district offices. Extension officers are equipped with hand-held readers that allow them to collect data on cattle in their ´crushes´ or kraals. The convenience, speed and accuracy of the LITS system have brought many benefits for Botswana´s livestock farmers, veterinary officers and health authorities. It can be used to locate lost or stolen cattle, and to monitor and manage disease outbreaks. The stomach bolus is safe for the animals, there are few field losses, criminal tampering is not possible, and it is easy to read because it is always in the same place. Also, the bolus is retrieved at the slaughterhouse and can be recycled, keeping costs low. It is a vast improvement on passive livestock identification systems such as ear tags, which require animals to be checked manually until the correct one is found. Locating a dozen cattle that require treatment from a herd of 200 used to be very time consuming. Now, all the animals simply file between two RFID readers, and a control gate automatically guides the required cattle into an isolation pen. New ways of working LITS has encouraged everyone involved in livestock management to be more thorough and to be creative in finding new ways of working and monitoring performance. Veterinary officers, for example, can now: rapidly isolate animals for treatment; update health records at the point of treatment; track weight gain in selected animals; correlate feeding programmes with yield; select specific bulls for breeding programmes; and track animal family trees. Livestock are not only valuable assets, they are also the start of a food supply chain with serious consequences in terms of health and profitability if the risks are not properly managed. RFID technology can make a significant contribution to the auditing of livestock lifecycles for many purposes, ranging from improving yield and optimizing feeding regimes, to ensuring conformance with EU regulations. The LITS initiative has demonstrated the direct and immediate benefits that can be achieved through the application of established and emerging technologies. In Botswana the system is helping to ensure the long-term security of its beef export market and offers an additional marketing edge, enabling the country to compete worldwide for new export orders.
