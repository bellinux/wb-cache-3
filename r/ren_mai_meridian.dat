40|$|Abstract Background A {{conceptual}} model of lateral muscular tension in patients presenting thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) has been recently described. Clinical improvement {{has been achieved}} by using acupuncture on points belonging to the so-called extraordinary meridians. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the anatomical structures related to these acupuncture points by means of 3 D MRI image rendering relying on external markers. Methods The investigation was carried out the index case patient of the lateral tension model. A licensed medical acupuncture practitioner located the following acupuncture points: 1) Yin qiao <b>mai</b> <b>meridian</b> (medial ankle) : Kidney 3, Kidney 6, the plantar Kidney 6 (Nan jing description); 2) Yang qiao <b>mai</b> <b>meridian</b> (lateral ankle) : Bladder 62, Bladder 59, Bladder 61, and the plantar Bladder 62 (Nan jing description); 3) Dai <b>mai</b> <b>meridian</b> (wait) : Liver 13, Gall bladder 26, Gall bladder 27, Gall bladder 28, and Gall bladder 29. The points were marked by taping a nitro-glycerin capsule on the skin. Imaging was done on a Siemens Magnetom Avanto MR scanner using an array head and body coil. Mainly T 1 -weighted imaging sequences, as routinely used for patient exams, were used to obtain multi-slice images. The image data were rendered in 3 D modus using dedicated software (Leonardo, Siemens). Results Points of the Dai <b>mai</b> <b>meridian</b> – at the level of the waist – corresponded to the obliquus externus abdominis and the obliquus internus abdominis. Points of the Yin qiao <b>mai</b> <b>meridian</b> – at the medial side of the ankle – corresponded to tendinous structures of the flexor digitorum longus as well as to muscular structures of the abductor hallucis on the foot sole. Points of the Yang qiao <b>mai</b> <b>meridian</b> – at the lateral side of the ankle – corresponded to tendinous structures of the peroneus brevis, the peroneous longus, and the lateral surface of the calcaneus and close to the foot sole to the abductor digiti minimi. Conclusion This non-invasive MRI investigation has revealed the anatomical relations of acupuncture points belonging to 3 of the so-called extraordinary meridians. We conclude that the clinically developed "WOMED concept of lateral tension" is related to tendino-muscular structures. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Dantian {{is often}} {{translated}} as [...] "elixir field", {{indicating that the}} needling points called [...] "Sea of Qi", [...] "Gate of Origin" [...] and [...] "Stone Gate" [...] are not really sitting on the <b>Ren</b> <b>Mai</b> like dots on a line. Rather they represent a place from which the [...] "Sea of Qi" [...] etc. can be reached and influenced - either via the energy flow along the <b>Ren</b> <b>Mai</b> (Conception Vessel) or by penetrating deeper into the abdomen (the level {{to be determined by}} the length of the needle and the depth of its insertion, in the case of palpation, by the depth of penetration and Qi projection, in the case of breathing or movement exercises by the use of muscle tonus and combination, direction of connective tissue engagement etc.). Hence, as the point names indicate, the lower Dantian, which ever point it is associated with, ought {{to be seen as a}} three dimensional area of varying size inside the abdomen, not as a point on the abdomen. In that sense it is identical with the [...] "small hara" [...] or the [...] "small abdomen", terms used in some Chinese classical texts and commentaries that discuss the origin and location of the Qi Jing Ba Mai (Eight Extraordinary Vessels) to which the <b>Ren</b> <b>Mai</b> belongs and is connected. Modern commentators believe that the terms refer to [...] "the kidney reflex area below the umbilicus".|$|R
5000|$|A {{closer look}} at the {{discourse}} on location and function of the Extraordinary Vessels reveals that not only the <b>Ren</b> <b>Mai</b> (Conception Vessel) is involved with the function of the Hara or Dantian, but that the Chong Mai (Penetrating Vessel, the Du Mai (Governing Vessel) and the Dai Mai (Girdle Vessel) also play a part in defining the What and Wherewithal of the [...] "Sea of Qi", as all of them take part {{in one way or another}} in strengthening the lower Dantian and maintaining its connection and interaction with those energy fields of the body expressed in the form of meridians and organs.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the martial}} arts, Hara is {{sometimes}} considered as equivalent to, the lower {{of the three}} dantian (tanden in Japanese). Various styles of martial arts describe this as being just below or directly behind the umbilicus. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) the by-name Dantian is given alternatively to three acupuncture points: the [...] "Gate of Origin" [...] (Ren 4), and the [...] "Sea of Qi" [...] (Ren 6), and, by some, also to the [...] "Stone Gate" [...] (Ren 5). All three points are situated on the midline (centre of the linea alba) of the lower abdomen (i.e. below the navel). They constitute part of the <b>Ren</b> <b>Mai,</b> usually translated as Conception Vessel (CV), {{which is one of}} the Qi Jing Ba Mai, the Eight Extraordinary Vessels or eminent energy pathways of the body.|$|R
40|$|Infertility is {{not just}} a woman’s problem. Every third case of {{infertility}} appears to be due to men’s problems. Male infertility can be caused by some problems with the semen concentration or formation or semen quality of quantity. Our treated patient is 32 year old male, diagnoses with infertility due to highly viscous semen and sperm agglutination and agglomeration. Seven treatments were made with acupuncture, one treatment weekly. Treatments were made in a clinic for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and acupuncture by a doctor specialist in acupuncture. Treatments were made indoor, on a room temperature with duration of 35 - 40 minutes. After the treatments, the semen analysis showed that all analyzed parameters are with normal reference values, with no presence of sperm agglutination and agglomeration. The aim of the treatment was to correct the Yin defect. For that purpose acupuncture was performed on the meridians of Liver, Kidney, Spleen, Du <b>Mai</b> and <b>Ren</b> <b>Mai.</b> Acupuncture as part of the 5000 years old Traditional Chinese Medicine is a very effective treatment in male infertility, effectively stimulating the production of healthy semen and significantly improving the semen quality and quantity. With correct diagnosis and eradication of the root cause, the positive results are inevitable. ...|$|R
40|$|Psoriasis is {{a chronic}} {{autoimmune}} skin disorder. Psoriasis manifests as itchy and sore plaques on the skin, mostly {{located on the}} knees, elbows, scalp, palms or soles. Psoriasis affect people in all age groups, equally male and female. It {{is controlled by the}} type of white blood cells - T cells, which protect the body against infections and disease. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) psoriasis is considered as a Blood heat disorder. The treated patient is a 43 years old woman with psoriasis manifested on the both feet (soles). The psoriasis was present more than 20 years, but the last year patient’s soles were in the worst condition. The patient was treated with acupuncture treatment, in our clinic for TCM and acupuncture. The positive outcome was achieved after 13 treatments. Treatments were done once weekly, indoor, with duration of 35 - 40 minutes. The aim of the treatment was to correct the Yin defect, therefore were treated points located on the meridians of Spleen, Liver, Kidney, <b>Ren</b> <b>Mai</b> and Ashi (trigger) points on the soles. Acupuncture as part of the TCM is very helpful treatment in treating psoriasis as it can reduce the inflammation, itching and pain and improve the overall health of the patient. ...|$|R
40|$|Aim – The aim of {{this study}} is to show a case of a hypothyroidism, the results from the {{acupuncture}} treatment and the way it functions. Methods – Treated patient is a 29 year old woman diagnosed with hypothyroidism. She has done 6 treatments with acupuncture, one treatment every week, except the third treatment was made after two weeks because of flu and high body temperature. Treatments were done in a clinic for Traditional Chinese Medicine and acupuncture in Skopje, by a doctor specialist in acupuncture. The treated points are located on the <b>meridians</b> of Du <b>mai,</b> <b>Ren</b> <b>mai,</b> Liver, Large Intestine, Stomach, Spleen and Gall Bladder. Results – Before coming to the clinic the patients TSH level was 5, 9 and after finishing the treatment the TSH level was returned to 4, 6. The patient was experiencing extreme tiredness and low energy levels and after finishing the treatments her health was restored and all the associated symptoms were gone. We succeeded to get these positive results with only 6 treatments. Conclusion – The acupuncture treatment as part of the 5000 year old Traditional Chinese Medicine in this case of hypothyroidism is very successful treatment and gives very satisfying and positive results for a very short time...|$|R
50|$|The first {{animal is}} Tiger. It {{relates to the}} wood element, the season of spring and {{therefore}} the liver and gall bladder. The liver's emotion is anger and has many important functions including storing blood (xue), ensuring the smooth movement of qi {{in the body and}} housing the ethereal soul (hun). Liver xue nourishes the sinews therefore allowing physical exercise. The liver is often compared to an army general because it is 'responsible' for the smooth flow of qi, essential to all physiological processes of every organ and part of the body. The hun provides the mind (shen) with inspiration, creativity and a sense of direction in life. The emphasis of this exercise is grasping and stretching. By reaching up to bring down Heaven and reaching down to draw up Earth grasping is encouraged; which relates to sinews and therefore the liver. Rolling through the spine stimulates both yin and yang of <b>ren</b> <b>mai</b> and du mai channels activating the microcosmic orbit. This is then completed with a slow 'stalking' forward bend and sudden shout (release of anger) as the Tiger catches its prey with vigor while standing on one leg, to stretch the sinews while activating the jing well points at the tips of the fingers, opening PC-8 and incorporating another important Wood trait - balance.|$|R
40|$|Antimüllerian hormone (AMH) is {{produced}} in the ovarian follicles. The levels of the hormone on a blood test show woman’s ovarian reserves which determine {{the capacity of the}} egg cells in the ovaries needed for conception. We report a case of a 33 -year-old female diagnosed with the primary infertility for 3 years due to unsuccessful natural conceiving. The patient had regular menstrual cycle with duration of only 1 day. The patient’s blood test indicated an insufficiently grown follicles needed for conception, low AMH levels (0. 94 ng/mL), and high androstenedione (458 ng/mL) levels. The patient underwent 32 treatment cycles, one treatment every week, over a period of 1 year. After the treatment with acupuncture and infrared lamp, her menstrual cycle was lengthened to 4 days, and the blood analysis showed normally grown ovarian follicles up to 20 mm with good quality and normal hormone levels. According to the theories of the traditional Chinese medicine, this state of the health arises from obstructed energy Qi flow in the liver meridian. This obstruction is created due to some lifestyle changes, which in turn, interrupts the blood flow in the uterus and ovaries and contributes to an imbalance of the hormones. During this treatment, acupuncture points located on the Spleen, Bladder, Heart, Liver, Large Intestine, Gall Bladder, and Du <b>Mai</b> <b>meridians</b> were used...|$|R
25|$|In January 1994, Mary Archer, then a {{director}} of Anglia Television, attended {{a director}}s' meeting at which an impending takeover of Anglia Television by <b>MAI,</b> which owned <b>Meridian</b> Broadcasting, was discussed. The following day, Jeffrey Archer bought 50,000 shares in Anglia Television, {{acting on behalf of}} a friend, Broosk Saib. Shortly after this, it was announced publicly that Anglia Television would be taken over by MAI. As a result, the shares jumped in value, whereupon Archer sold them on behalf of his friend for a profit of £77,219. The arrangements he made with the stockbrokers meant {{he did not have to}} pay at the time of buying the shares.|$|R
50|$|Dinenage has {{appeared}} as presenter of many British television programmes (most of them produced by Southern Television and its successors TVS and Meridian Broadcasting), such as Tell The Truth, How and its successor How 2, {{as well as}} the BBC quiz show Pass The Buck and Gambit (produced by Anglia). He is also a newsreader, for many years presenting Meridian Tonight for ITV Meridian, alongside Debbie Thrower. He joined Meridian in 1993, though he was inherited as chief male news anchor of Meridian Tonight's predecessor programme Coast To Coast, on the TVS franchise which preceded Meridian. He co-hosted Coast To Coast alongside Fern Britton and <b>Mai</b> Davies, and <b>Meridian</b> Tonight alongside Natasha Kaplinsky, Debbie Thrower and Jane Wyatt.|$|R
50|$|The {{first wave}} of mergers began with Yorkshire Television {{acquiring}} Tyne Tees Television in 1992, forming a parent group called Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television Holdings. In 1994, Carlton Communications - which had owned a 20% stake in Central Independent Television - acquired {{the remainder of the}} company and, because of Central's shareholdings, inherited a 20% stake in Meridian Broadcasting. Later that year, Granada acquired London Weekend Television through a hostile takeover worth in the region of £750 million. <b>MAI,</b> which controlled <b>Meridian</b> Broadcasting, acquired Anglia Television; MAI became United News & Media after merging with United Newspapers - owners of The Daily Express in 1996. Ownership rules, that previously restricted ownership of ITV licences by one company to two outright, plus 20% in a third, were relaxed, and so Carlton went on to acquire Westcountry Television (later re-branding it Carlton, along with Central), Granada acquired Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Holdings (with the parent group becoming Granada Media, later simply Granada) and United acquired HTV.|$|R
5000|$|In early 1994, Anglia Television {{was bought}} by <b>MAI</b> (owners of <b>Meridian</b> Broadcasting), who merged with United Newspapers to form United News and Media. They were joined by HTV in 1996. In 2000, {{following}} United's aborted merger attempt with Carlton Communications, Granada plc bought the TV assets of United (but sold the broadcasting arm of HTV). In 2004, Granada finally merged with Carlton to form ITV plc, which ended Anglia Television's existence as a separate brand. During its period of UBM ownership, a 'youth' channel was launched to cable and satellite from Anglia Television's facilities, Rapture TV; some productions for the ITV network were also shared with Rapture, which was retained by UBM after the sale to Granada, but later closed down and its assets sold. Many early programmes for the newly launched Channel 5 were made at Anglia Television, as UBM also owned {{a stake in the}} channel (later sold to RTL Group).|$|R
50|$|In 1992, Yorkshire Television and Tyne Tees Television merged again, {{creating}} Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc. The {{two companies}} {{were permitted to}} merge before their existing arrangements expired in June 1992, due to the marginal nature of both companies' finances, and a need to rationalise the two companies before the franchise handover date. Takeovers began in earnest in 1994, as Carlton Television took over Central Independent Television having held {{a stake in the}} company since 1987, Granada Television bought LWT in a hostile bid and <b>MAI,</b> owners of <b>Meridian</b> Broadcasting, took over Anglia Television. As a result of the latter, Anglia Television's presentation and playout facilities were moved to Meridian Broadcasting's base in Southampton. In 1996 Carlton Television bought Westcountry Television and increased its stake in Central Independent Television to 81%. Then, in 1997, Granada Television acquired Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television and moved the presentation and playout of Granada Television, Yorkshire Television and Tyne Tees Television to The Leeds Studios, while Scottish Media Group (SMG), which owned Scottish Television, acquired Grampian Television and began to consolidate staff at its studio base in Glasgow. Also in 1997, United News and Media, the evolution of MAI and owner of Meridian Broadcasting and Anglia Television, purchased HTV; however, few departments were consolidated.|$|R
