25|$|The angle {{between two}} spheres at a <b>real</b> <b>point</b> of {{intersection}} is the dihedral angle {{determined by the}} tangent planes to the spheres at that point. Two spheres intersect at the same angle at all points of their circle of intersection.

25|$|By {{examining}} the common solutions of the equations of two spheres, {{it can be}} seen that two spheres intersect in a circle and the plane containing that circle is called the radical plane of the intersecting spheres. Although the radical plane is a real plane, the circle may be imaginary (the spheres have no <b>real</b> <b>point</b> in common) or consist of a single point (the spheres are tangent at that point).|$|E
25|$|The Fallschirmjägers' {{greatest}} {{victory and}} greatest losses {{occurred during the}} Battle of Crete. Signals intelligence, {{in the form of}} Ultra, enabled the British to wait on each German drop zone, yet despite compromised secrecy, surviving German paratroops and airlanded mountain troops pushed the Commonwealth forces off the island in part by unexpected fire support from their light 75 mm guns, though seaborne reinforcements were destroyed by the Royal Navy. However, the losses were so great that Adolf Hitler forbade their use in such operations in the future. He felt that the main strength of the paratroopers was novelty, and now that the British had clearly figured out how to defend against them, there was no <b>real</b> <b>point</b> to using them any more.|$|E

If the set of <b>real</b> <b>points</b> realizes the same homology class as the complexification of a real curve on the surface, then the complement of the curve in set of <b>real</b> <b>points</b> is equipped a pair of opposite orientations, which do not extend across the curve, and the whole set of <b>real</b> <b>points</b> is equipped with a Pin^- structure. These constructions are similar to the complex orientations of real algebraic curves dividing their complexifications and generalize to high dimensions...|$|R

500|$|On February 14, 1992, Scientology leader David Miscavige gave Ted Koppel {{his first}} {{interview}} on Scientology on the ABC News program Nightline. The program noted that Scientology has vocal critics and cited Behar's 1991 article. Behar {{appeared on the}} program and gave his opinion of why individuals join Scientology, stating that the organization's [...] "ulterior motive" [...] is really {{to get people to}} take high-priced audit counseling. Behar stated on the program that he had evidence that members of the Church of Scientology had obtained his personal phone records. Later in the program, Koppel questioned Miscavige on the Church of Scientology's response to the Time magazine article, particularly the $3 million the church spent advertising in USA Today. Miscavige explained that the first three weeks of the advertising campaign was meant to correct falsehoods from the Time article, {{and the rest of the}} twelve-week campaign was dedicated to informing the public about Scientology. Koppel asked Miscavige what specifically had upset him about the Time article, and Miscavige called Behar [...] "a hater". Miscavige noted that Behar had written an article on Scientology and the Internal Revenue Service three years before he began work on the Time piece, and made allegations that Behar had attempted to get two Scientologists kidnapped. When Koppel questioned Miscavige further on this, Miscavige said that individuals had contacted Behar after an earlier article, and Behar had told them to [...] "kidnap Scientologists out". Koppel pressed further, noting that this was a serious charge to make, and asked Miscavige if his allegations were accurate, why he had not pressed charges for attempted kidnapping. Miscavige said Koppel was [...] "missing the issue", and said that his <b>real</b> <b>point</b> was that he thought the article was not an objective piece.|$|E

Socrates is the impresario who sings off key, the boxer who throws the match not for money, but because he can. The dialogue does not establish Socrates' absurd thesis, that the deliberate liar is better than the witless one, but it does prove that Plato is as clever as Homer. Socrates, who pretends to be a lover of good reasoning, is widely thought to be what he says he is, a rational man.

2500|$|In {{non-standard}} analysis, a real-valued function f {{of a real}} {{variable is}} microcontinuous at a point a precisely if the difference f*(a+δ)−f*(a) is infinitesimal whenever δ is infinitesimal. [...] Thus f is continuous on a set A in R precisely if f* is microcontinuous at every <b>real</b> <b>point</b> a∈A. [...] Uniform continuity can be expressed as the condition that (the natural extension of) f is microcontinuous not only at real points in A, but at all points in its non-standard counterpart (natural extension) *A in *R. Note that there exist hyperreal-valued functions which meet this criterion but are not uniformly continuous, as well as uniformly continuous hyperreal-valued functions which do not meet this criterion, however, such functions cannot be expressed in the form f* for any real-valued function f.

2500|$|Montgomery {{showed that}} (assuming the Riemann hypothesis) at least 2/3 of all zeros are simple, and a related {{conjecture}} {{is that all}} zeros of the zeta function are simple (or more generally have no non-trivial integer linear relations between their imaginary parts). Dedekind zeta functions of algebraic number fields, which generalize the Riemann zeta function, often do have multiple complex zeros [...] This is because the Dedekind zeta functions factorize {{as a product of}} powers of Artin L-functions, so zeros of Artin L-functions sometimes give rise to multiple zeros of Dedekind zeta functions. Other examples of zeta functions with multiple zeros are the L-functions of some elliptic curves: these can have multiple zeros at the <b>real</b> <b>point</b> of their critical line; the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture predicts that the multiplicity of this zero is the rank of the elliptic curve.|$|E

[...] Thus they rely on the old-fashioned ritual ceremony. [...] The {{elements of}} the ceremony are made deliberately specific, bizarre, and painful so that the event is both memorable and unambiguous, and the ceremony is witnessed by a number of senior mafiosi.

Central to the plan was the destruction of the Axis armour by 7th Armoured Division to allow the relatively lightly armoured XIII Corps to advance north to Bardia on the coast whilst XXX Corps continued north-west to Tobruk and link with a break-out by 70th Division. There was also a deception plan to persuade the Axis that the main Allied attack would not be ready until early December and would be a sweeping outflanking move through Jarabub, an oasis {{on the edge of the}} Great Sand Sea, more than [...] to the south of the <b>real</b> <b>point</b> of attack.
