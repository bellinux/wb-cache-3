25|$|There {{are three}} main {{mechanisms}} of achieving dosage compensation which are widely {{documented in the}} literature and which are common to most species. These include random inactivation of one female X chromosome (as observed in Mus musculus), a two-fold increase in the transcription of a single male X chromosome (as observed in Drosophila melanogaster), and decreased transcription by half in both of the X chromosomes of a hermaphroditic organism (as observed in Caenorhabditis elegans). These mechanisms have been widely studied and manipulated in model organisms commonly used in the laboratory <b>research</b> <b>setting.</b> A summary of these forms of dosage compensation is illustrated below. However, there are also other less common forms of dosage compensation, which are not as widely researched and are sometimes specific to only one species (as observed in certain bird and monotreme species).|$|E
500|$|In November 1813, the College {{agreed to}} {{incorporate}} its medical school with The College of Physicians and Surgeons, {{a new school}} created by the Regents of New York, forming Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. The college's enrollment, structure, and academics stagnated {{for the majority of}} the 19th century, with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the college functioned. In 1857, the college moved from the King's College campus at Park Place to a primarily Gothic Revival campus on 49thStreet and Madison Avenue, where it remained for the next forty years. During the last half of the 19th century, under the leadership of President F.A.P. Barnard, the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a modern university. By this time, the college's investments in New York real estate became a primary source of steady income for the school, mainly owing to the city's expanding population. University president Seth Low moved the campus from 49thStreet to its present location, a more spacious campus in the developing neighborhood of Morningside Heights. Under the leadership of Low's successor, Nicholas Murray Butler, who served for over four decades, Columbia rapidly became the nation's major institution for <b>research,</b> <b>setting</b> the [...] "multiversity" [...] model that later universities would adopt. Prior to becoming the president of Columbia University, Butler founded Teachers College, as a school to prepare home economists and manual art teachers for the children of the poor, with philanthropist Grace Hoadley Dodge. Teachers College came under the aegis of Columbia University in 1893 and became the University's Graduate School of Education.|$|E

40|$|The goal of diploma {{work is to}} {{describe}} current state of volunteering within social rehabilitation in the facilities providing social services {{in the town of}} Benešov and the surrounding area. Partial aim of diploma work is to find out the positive effects of the project Patron which was included in the work as an example of application of volunteering within social. With regards of the above mentioned goals, two <b>research</b> questions were <b>set.</b> 1. How is volunteering within social rehabilitation being used in organisations providing social services? 2. What are the positive effects of project Patron? Quantitative strategy, questioning method, the technique of managed and semi managed interview were used for <b>research.</b> <b>Set</b> <b>research</b> questions were answered by means of three <b>research</b> <b>sets,</b> where the technique of semi managed interview was used and one research subject, where the technique of managed interview was used. To ascertain the first research question a <b>research</b> <b>set</b> comprising of 10 social workers employed in facilities providing social services in the town of Benešov or the surrounding area was determined. Given criteria for taking part in the research was the length of employment of social workers being more than on year in their profession. The range of questions for the first <b>research</b> <b>set</b> was prepared for the case when the facility was using the help of volunteers and not. After gaining the necessary data, interviews were rewritten and evaluated with the help of open coding process when all the data was clearly organized into each category. Results arising from data gained in the first <b>research</b> <b>set</b> show that all facilities, where the informants work, providing social services apply social rehabilitation. The research further shows that 7 out of 10 facilities for social services use volunteers who participate on social rehabilitation of their clients and they are in the direct contact with clients. Volunteers, according to gained results, work with clients individually and in groups. 5 of the facilities using the help of volunteers are considering the expansion of volunteering and thinking about other areas where they could include the work of volunteers. One of the facilities which does not use volunteers is preparing for including volunteers in their work. Second research question of diploma work was researched by the means of third <b>research</b> <b>sets</b> and one <b>research</b> subject. The second set comprised of 5 boys who live in children's home near the town of Benešov and who are the clients of project Patron. The third <b>research</b> <b>sets</b> comprised of 5 men who volunteer for the project Patron. To complete information about project Patron and interview with a research subject representing the manager of project Patron was made. To gain necessary data the interviews were rewritten and then evaluated. Data gained from the second and third <b>research</b> <b>sets</b> were evaluated with the help of open coding process when all the data was clearly organized into each category Information gained from research subject was based on the research technique interpreted with the help of interview transcription. Data obtained from <b>research</b> <b>sets</b> show that clients and volunteers of project Patron {{get to know each other}} during common weekends. Volunteers meet the clients approximately once or twice a month to take part in their favourite activities and to talk. The research further shows volunteers and clients have good relationships based on trust. Based on answers from all informants we can without doubt claim that project Patron has very big positive effect. Clients of the project state they are glad they gained a new adult friend because in the children's home they lack male role models. Volunteers see the positive effect of project Patron in the possibility to help boys from children's home to get to know the world with the help of adult male...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays Czech {{young people}} {{have more and more}} {{experience}} with addictive substances, particularly with alcohol, nicotine and marihuana. Therefore the author has decided to find out the most frequent motives leading to drugs taking at high schools students. Due to the lack of relevant information for this area the author maps out the situation in the district of Jindřichův Hradec. Statistics concerning the issue of drugs taking are always related to the regions or the whole Czech Republic. The author has carried out quantitative research using the method of questioning and the technique of the anonymous questionnaire. The set was determined by the quote random sample and the quote was the age, sex and type of school. The basic <b>research</b> <b>set</b> consisted of three subsets. <b>Research</b> <b>set</b> A involved students from Gymnasium schools, <b>research</b> <b>set</b> B involved students from other secondary schools and <b>research</b> <b>set</b> C involved students from apprentice training centres. The research showed that the motives for drugs taking are not much different with respect to students from individual schools. According to the secondary school students in Jindřichův Hradec there belong among the most frequent motives longing for unusual experience and the inability to solve their problem or life crisis in a different way than by using the addictive substance. Further there was proved that students of apprentice training centres have more frequent experience with drugs taking than students from secondary school and Gymnasium schools. Contribution of the Bachelor thesis lies in the mapping out secondary schools of the Jindřichův Hradec area with respect to the drug taking issue which was according to the opinions of schools headmasters missing for generating a complex conception of the drug taking issue in the area. The author assumes that making a research particularly in smaller regions could help to solve the drug taking issue generally.
