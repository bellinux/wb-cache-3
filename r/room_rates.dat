5|$|In {{keeping with}} Frank Case's long-standing {{tradition}} of sending popovers and celery {{to the more}} impoverished members of the Round Table, the Algonquin offers lunch discounts to struggling writers. Formerly, writers on tour could stay one night at the hotel free in exchange for an autographed copy of their book, although the practice has been amended to include a discount on standard <b>room</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{conference and}} meeting sector is also growing. In 2012, the city hosted 780 {{international}} gatherings, up from 754 in 2011. The high supply of hotel rooms has kept <b>room</b> <b>rates</b> lower than expected, {{with the average}} room rate for four- and five-star hotels in 2012 at just RMB950 (US$153).|$|E
50|$|Members of {{the hotel}} are given {{discounted}} <b>rooms</b> <b>rates</b> {{for themselves and their}} guests and receive member-only promotions.|$|R

30|$|Principal Reese {{agrees to}} act as a {{reseller}} of hotel rooms offered by Harry and Mike. When reselling a room, Reese decides a <b>room</b> resell <b>rate</b> that is based on her business contract with the hotel and issues customers with an unforgable <b>room</b> resell <b>rate</b> agreement to be presented on arrival to the hotel. Customers pay the hotel directly for their room according to the amount specified in the resell rate. The arrangement is that, in reselling a room, Reese provides the hotel with a guaranteed <b>room</b> <b>rate.</b> Any surplus between the <b>room</b> resell <b>rate</b> and the guaranteed rate is passed on to Reese, while Reese is liable for any deficit.|$|R
25|$|Suites {{include a}} {{separate}} bedroom with king size {{bed and a}} full bath, living area with two queen size sofa beds, and an additional full bath. <b>Room</b> <b>rates</b> are based on pay grade. The maximum amount of rooms that can be reserved by one person is three. Rooms are {{comparable to those of}} Deluxe Disney resorts.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after World War II the US {{military}} {{took over}} the Schneefernerhaus (as the hotel at the top was then called) for the exclusive use of US military and civilian employees. <b>Room</b> <b>rates,</b> including meals, were US $1 per day. Ski lessons were available, taught by Austrians and Germans, {{at a cost of}} US $0.25 per hour.|$|E
25|$|The city's TIF {{financing}} proposal was controversial. Critics such as Charles W. McMillion (chief {{economist at the}} business consulting firm MBG Information Services) argued that the convention headquarters hotel would lead to lower sales tax revenue by reducing pressure on hotel <b>room</b> <b>rates</b> throughout the city and by keeping attendees away from local restaurants and retail businesses. The convention headquarters hotel, critics also noted, would not have enough attendance {{to make up the}} lost sales tax revenue. Executives at other hotel chains said the city's financing deal projected sales tax revenue of $40 million to $48 million a year, but a more reasonable estimate was $25 million to $30 million a year. City officials countered by pointing to the two studies conducted in 2000 which came to different conclusions, and by noting that the convention center had promised those booking large meetings at the site that a headquarters hotel would be open by 2007. Without the hotel, these groups could cancel completely, they said.|$|E
50|$|A resort fee is {{collected}} {{separately from the}} advertised <b>room</b> <b>rate.</b> A guest may pay in advance {{with a credit card}} for a room online. There he is paying the advertised <b>room</b> <b>rate</b> and all necessary taxes. This guest may assume that is the final price of the hotel. When the guest arrives at a hotel with a resort fee, he will be forced to pay the additional resort fee for his entire stay at the front desk when he checks in.|$|R

50|$|A resort fee {{is a daily}} {{mandatory}} {{additional charge}} that the hotel separates out from the advertised price. Consumer advocates equate this to paying a second <b>room</b> <b>rate.</b> The average resort fee costs $24.93 per day.|$|R
25|$|There {{were many}} {{concerns}} expressed by local residents and historic preservationists by the successful Trump bid. Preservationists believed Trump would not respect the historic {{nature of the}} building and had almost no experience renovating historic properties but government officials said any redesign would need to be approved by the Commission of Fine Arts (whose secretary signaled heavy scrutiny for any changes). Trump dismissed concerns that he lacked experience with historic buildings, pointing to his redevelopment of Grand Central Terminal in New York City and the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. Some city residents worried that Trump would block access to the clock tower. However, the National Park Service said it will retain control over the clock tower and observation deck and it will keep them open for tours. Washington Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein questioned the financial wisdom of selecting Trump/Colony Capital, given Trump's extensive problems with bankruptcy and Colony Capital's current problems keeping its hotel properties out of receivership. Pearlstein and local hoteliers argued that the market would not support the <b>room</b> <b>rates</b> Trump wished to charge, and therefore {{would not be able to}} support the excessive amount of redevelopment money and rent Trump was paying for the property. Robert Peck, Commissioner of the General Services Administration, defended the selection, arguing that the Trump/Colony Capital bid was by far the best in terms of financial commitment, experience in renovating and managing properties, and quality of design. Peck dismissed criticism about Trump's numerous past bankruptcies, noting that these mostly concerned casinos rather than hotels.|$|E
500|$|In April 1904, Harvey {{organized}} the Monte Ne Club House Hotel and Cottage Company with capital stock of $250,000. A. O. Clarke, from St. Louis, served as architect and {{superintendent of the}} company. Harvey wanted to build five large hotels: a three-story main building called the Club House Hotel and four 300 to 450 foot (91 to 137m) long [...] "cottage rows", each to be named for a state bordering on Arkansas. Stock holders in the company received stock certificates that listed privileges such as transportation on the Monte Ne Railroad with 150lb (68kg) of baggage and a 25% discount for the stockholder and his family at the Hotel Monte Ne. Missouri Row, begun in August 1904, was the first hotel constructed. This Clarke-designed building was [...] wide and [...] long and built of 8,000 logs with a concrete floor and red tile roof. Fourteen thousand cubic feet (396mÂ³) of concrete were used. The tiles were shipped from Chicago. The center and two ends of the hotel rose to two stories, the remainder being a single story. Hotel Monte Ne and Missouri Row both featured porches [...] long. The hotel had forty 16 feet square (4.9 metres square) rooms, each with a fireplace. Harvey employed area carpenters and stonemasons to build Missouri Row. In April 1905, to save time and money, the work schedule was changed from 9 to 10 hours per day and some wages were cut. Many workers went on strike, and when their demands were not met, they quit. The men formed a union, and although Harvey {{thought of himself as}} a friend to the working man, he viewed unions as another kind of monopoly or trust. The strike delayed construction, {{but by the end of}} May 1905, a full workforce was in place. In July, carpet, washstands and furniture, including iron-and-brass bedsteads, were installed in the rooms. Cannonballs and shells from the Pea Ridge battlefield were sunk into the concrete porch on either side of the main entrance. The hotel opened in September 1905 with <b>room</b> <b>rates</b> of $1 a day and $6 a week.|$|E
2500|$|At most venues, {{participants}} and accompanying persons {{were obliged to}} accommodate at the [...] "official hotel", appointed by the local organizers. The <b>room</b> <b>rates,</b> however, would be significantly higher than for other hotel guests. This in fact triggered {{the founding of the}} ACP. Also the standard of the hotels {{as well as of the}} food has been a focus of complaints by players and journalists.|$|E

2500|$|The airport {{has both}} {{short and long}} term parking lots, with a {{combined}} capacity of 1,500 parking spaces. [...] There is a 15-minute grace period in the short term parking lot. [...] The short term lot is closer to the terminal building, though the long term lot generally provides lower rates. Several area hotels participate in the airport's [...] "Park and Fly" [...] program, in that they offer special <b>room</b> <b>rates</b> and free shuttle service for airport patrons.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1999, the Ritz-Carlton {{announced}} {{it would not be}} renewing its lease at its Liberty Place location and would be relocating to Two Mellon Center. St. Regis hotel took its place later that year. The St. Regis wasn't able to maintain the same <b>room</b> <b>rates</b> as Philadelphia's other luxury hotels and was re-branded as the Westin in February 2000, now focusing on business travelers. In June 2002, Two Liberty Place was sold to the Shorenstein Company of San Francisco. The sale was reported to be for $US200 million and included Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association continuing as first-mortgage lender. On April 26, 2004, Cigna {{announced it}} would remain in Two Liberty Place after getting millions of dollars in incentives from the city and state, though would be leasing less space. Now with [...] vacant, Shorenstein Co. and Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association sold their interests in Two Liberty Place to private equity firm America's Capital Partners and its partner residential developer Falcone Group for US$151 million.|$|E

5000|$|Motel 6 {{was founded}} in Santa Barbara, California, in 1962, by two local {{building}} contractors, William Becker and Paul Greene. The partners developed a plan to build motels with <b>rooms</b> at bargain <b>rates.</b> They decided on a $6.00 <b>room</b> <b>rate</b> per night (equivalent to $ in [...] ) that would cover building costs, land leases, and janitorial supplies; hence the company name [...] "Motel 6".|$|R

5000|$|In March 2013, the Las Vegas City Council {{unanimously}} {{approved a}} one-year extension {{for the start}} of construction on the project, as Kaufman said <b>room</b> <b>rates</b> had not increased enough for the hotel to operate: [...] "The problem is <b>room</b> <b>rates</b> are low so we need to spend less money because we can't charge more. How do we make it more affordable to build?" [...] Kaufman said a potential solution would be the construction of a 100-room hotel with a restaurant, with the possibility of expanding the project as part of a later second phase.|$|E

50|$|Since resort {{fees are}} a {{mandatory}} fee {{that is not}} included in the advertised <b>room</b> <b>rate</b> of the hotel the fee is often priced differently. Since a portion of the <b>room</b> <b>rate</b> is separated out, that portion is not considered for taxes. This is lost revenue for the city and state. A hotel in New York City that charges resort fees only has the Javits Center Tax and the New York City occupancy tax apply to the advertised rate of the hotel. If the resort fee is $50, that is $50 that is not being used in the calculation of those taxes. Resort fees in New York City are only being charged the sales tax for the state and city and not the occupancy tax.|$|R
