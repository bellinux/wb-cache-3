25|$|In 1799 William Murdoch, {{who worked}} for the firm of Boulton and Watt, invented a new type of steam valve, called the D slide valve. This, in effect, slid {{backwards}} and forwards admitting steam to one end of the cylinder then the other. Matthew Murray improved the working of these valves by driving them with an eccentric gear attached to the <b>rotating</b> <b>shaft</b> of the engine.|$|E
25|$|A commutated DC motor has {{a set of}} {{rotating}} windings {{wound on}} an armature mounted on a <b>rotating</b> <b>shaft.</b> The shaft also carries the commutator, a long-lasting rotary electrical switch that periodically reverses the flow of current in the rotor windings as the shaft rotates. Thus, every brushed DC motor has AC flowing through its rotating windings. Current flows through one or more pairs of brushes that bear on the commutator; the brushes connect an external source of electric power to the rotating armature.|$|E
2500|$|A {{disc brake}} {{is a type}} of brake that uses {{calipers}} to squeeze pairs of pads against a rotor (or [...] "disc") in order to create friction that retards the rotation of a shaft, such as a vehicle axle, either to reduce its rotational speed or to hold it stationary. The energy of motion is converted into waste heat which must be dispersed. Hydraulic disc brakes are the most commonly used form of brake for motor vehicles but the principles of a disc brake are applicable to almost any <b>rotating</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of September 10, 1913, George Overst, then aged 20, who was serving as a fireman on the Rainbow was seriously injured when his {{clothing}} caught around a <b>rotating</b> <b>shaft</b> in the vessel's machinery. [...] He could have been killed except that at just that moment the sternwheeler was coming in to the dock at Marshfield, and the engines were reversed, unwinding Overst's clothing and permitting him to free himself. [...] Overst had only been in Coos Bay a few months and was originally from Sherwood, Oregon.|$|E
2500|$|A crank is an arm {{attached}} at a {{right angle}} to a <b>rotating</b> <b>shaft</b> [...] by which reciprocating motion is imparted to or received from the shaft. It is used to convert circular motion into reciprocating motion, or vice versa. The arm may be a bent portion of the shaft, or a separate arm or disk attached to it. [...] Attached {{to the end of}} the crank by a pivot is a rod, usually called a connecting rod (conrod). [...] The end of the rod attached to the crank moves in a circular motion, while the other end is usually constrained to move in a linear sliding motion.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the Schneider patent design, Saulnier's {{device was}} {{actually}} built, {{and may be}} considered the first practical [...] synchronization gear to be tested. For {{the first time the}} cam producing the to-and-fro movement conveying firing impulses to the gun is situated at the engine, (driven in this case by the same spindle that operated the oil pump and the tachometer) and the impulses themselves are transmitted by a reciprocating rod rather than Schneider's <b>rotating</b> <b>shaft.</b> The idea of literally [...] "interrupting" [...] the firing of the gun gives way (probably as the result of experience) to the principle of pulling the trigger for each successive shot, like the action of a semi-automatic weapon.|$|E
40|$|Fault {{diagnosis}} of incipient crack failure in <b>rotating</b> <b>shafts</b> allows the detection and identiﬁcation of performance degradation {{as early as}} possible in industrial plants, such as downtime and potential injury to personnel. The present work studies the performance and effectiveness of crack fault detection by means of applying wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) on fault {{diagnosis of}} <b>rotating</b> <b>shafts</b> using multiscale entropy (MSE). After WPD and EMD, the most sensitive reconstruction vectors and intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are selected using Shannon entropy. Then, these feature vectors are fed into support vector machine (SVM) for fault classiﬁcation, where the entropy features represent the complexity of vibration signals with different scales. Experimental results have demonstrated that WPD combined with MSE can achieve an accuracy of 97. 3 % for crack fault detection in <b>rotating</b> <b>shafts,</b> whilst EMD combined with MSE has shown a higher detection rate of 98. 5 %...|$|R
25|$|Most {{practical}} mechanical analog computers of {{any significant}} complexity used <b>rotating</b> <b>shafts</b> to carry variables from one mechanism to another. Cables and pulleys {{were used in}} a Fourier synthesizer, a tide-predicting machine, which summed the individual harmonic components. Another category, not nearly as well known, used <b>rotating</b> <b>shafts</b> only for input and output, with precision racks and pinions. The racks were connected to linkages that performed the computation. At least one US Naval sonar fire control computer of the later 1950s, made by Librascope, was of this type, as was the principal computer in the Mk. 56 Gun Fire Control System.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the passive control of lateral critical speeds in high-speed <b>rotating</b> <b>shafts</b> through application of eccentric balancing sleeves. Equations of motion for a <b>rotating</b> flexible <b>shaft</b> with eccentric sleeves at the free ends are derived using the extended Hamilton Principle, considering inertial, non-constant rotating speed, Coriolis and centrifugal effects. A {{detailed analysis of}} the passive control characteristics of the eccentric sleeve mechanism {{and its impact on the}} shaft dynamics, is presented. Results of the analysis are compared with those from three-dimensional finite element simulations for 3 practical case studies. Through a comparison and evaluation of the relative differences in critical speeds from both approaches it is shown that consideration of eccentric sleeve flexibility becomes progressively more important with increasing sleeve length. The study shows that the critical speed of high-speed <b>rotating</b> <b>shafts</b> can be effectively controlled through implementation of variable mass/stiffness eccentric sleeve systems...|$|R
50|$|Commonly, {{torque sensors}} or torque {{transducers}} use strain gauges {{applied to a}} <b>rotating</b> <b>shaft</b> or axle. With this method, a means to power the strain gauge bridge is necessary, {{as well as a}} means to receive the signal from the <b>rotating</b> <b>shaft.</b> This can be accomplished using slip rings, wireless telemetry, or rotary transformers. Newer types of torque transducers add conditioning electronics and an A/D converter to the <b>rotating</b> <b>shaft.</b> Stator electronics then read the digital signals and convert those signals to a high-level analog output signal, such as +/-10VDC.|$|E

40|$|The {{pursuit of}} high Mach number flight {{presents}} several {{challenges to the}} airframe and engine design engineers. Most obvious is the resulting high temperatures encountered as the aircraft approaches Mach 3 and above. The encountered high temperatures and shaft speeds of engines require rethinking {{in the areas of}} material selections, component design and component operating life. In the area of sump compartment sealing, {{one of the most difficult}} sealing applications is the sealing of an engine s rear sump. Normally this sump will need some method of sealing between two <b>rotating</b> <b>shafts.</b> This sealing operation is done with an intershaft seal. The aft sump region also presents an additional design requirement for the intershaft seal. This region has to absorb the engine s thermal growth, which means that in the seal area, axial movement, on the order of 0. 30 in., between the <b>rotating</b> <b>shafts</b> must be tolerated. A new concept or new technology of sealing an intershaft sump configuration is being developed. This concept, called a rotating intershaft brush seal has key attributes that will allow this seal to perform better, in the demanding environment of sealing an aft sump with two <b>rotating</b> <b>shafts,</b> when compared to today s sealing technology of labyrinth and carbon se...|$|R

The mechanical seal assembly generally includes a rotating sealing ring fixed to the shaft, a non-rotating sealing ring adjacent to and in close contact with the rotating sealing ring for forming an annular seal about the shaft, and a mechanical diode element that applies a biasing force to the non-rotating sealing ring by means of hemispherical joint.

This simple model has then been used for analysing non-linear dynamic behaviour of cracked <b>rotating</b> <b>shafts,</b> which occurs when breathing is governed by the vibration itself. Finally, also the effects of cracks which have developed according a helix, instead of developing on a cross section, due to the combined action of bending and torsion, are investigated. The breathing behaviour and still more the deflections are then influenced by the torsion. The aim of these investigations is mainly to present behaviours of full size industrial machinery, computed numerically with finite element models of the shaft...|$|R
