5|$|The {{role that}} gender plays {{in health care}} access can be {{determined}} by examining <b>resource</b> <b>allocation</b> within the household and public sphere. Gender discrimination begins before birth; females are the most commonly aborted sex in India. If a female fetus is not aborted, the mother’s pregnancy can be a stressful experience, due to her family’s preference for a son. Once born, daughters are prone to being fed less than sons, especially when there are multiple girls already in the household. As women mature into adulthood, many of the barriers preventing them from achieving equitable levels of health stem from the low status of women and girls in Indian society, particularly in the rural and poverty-affected areas.|$|E

This {{study investigated}} the characteristics of various water resources in Tianjin, explored the needs {{for the study of}} water <b>resources</b> <b>allocation,</b> and identified the current issues of water <b>resources</b> <b>allocation</b> in Tianjin. The water <b>resources</b> <b>allocation</b> framework was established by adopting the cultural algorithm approach.

Simulation results show that adaptive <b>resources</b> <b>allocation</b> for multiuser OFDM system can be done by normal PSO and modified PSO in these three scenarios. Comparing the allocation scheme of both algorithms, this modified PSO (PSO and GA) can greatly improve performance of adaptive <b>resources</b> <b>allocations...</b>|$|R

25|$|Economics is {{a social}} science which studies the production, distribution, trade, and {{consumption}} of goods and services. Economics focuses on measurable variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: microeconomics, which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers {{the economy as a}} whole, in which case it considers aggregate supply and demand for money, capital and commodities. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are <b>resource</b> <b>allocation,</b> production, distribution, trade, and competition. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that involves choice under scarcity or determining economic value.|$|E
25|$|Many {{invasive}} ants display unicoloniality. The {{adaptive value}} of this nonaggression among colonies {{has to do with}} avoiding unnecessary injury and allowing proper <b>resource</b> <b>allocation,</b> ensuring success for all the colonies. Low nestmate recognition, caused in part by polygyny, also has a biochemical basis in M. pharaonis. Cuticular hydrocarbons are compounds, often found on antennae, that allow for communication in many social insects. In ant species, these compounds play an especially key role in nestmate recognition. Differences in cuticular hydrocarbons are detected by other ant species, who respond accordingly. However, all pharaoh ant colonies have the same hydrocarbons on their antennae. This leads to ineffective nestmate recognition, and nonaggression between colonies.|$|E

Emphasis {{has been placed on}} maintaining strict fiscal discipline, greater openness to trade and financial flows, market liberalisation and reduction in the size of government. During this period, a large share of the economy was returned to private sector ownership through divestment and privatisation programmes.|$|E
