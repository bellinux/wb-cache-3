5|$|While {{studying}} in Germany, Sutcliffe began experiencing severe headaches and acute sensitivity to light. In April 1962, he {{collapsed in the}} middle of an art class after complaining of head pains. German doctors performed various checks, but were unable to determine the exact cause of his headaches. On 10 April 1962, he was taken to the hospital, but died in the ambulance on the way. The cause of death was later revealed to have been an aneurysm in his brain's <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{left and}} right sides of the brain appear symmetrical, but they {{function}} asymmetrically. For example, the counterpart of the left-hemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the right-hemisphere area controlling the left hand. There are, however, several important exceptions, involving language and spatial cognition. The left frontal lobe is dominant for language. If a key language area in the left hemisphere is damaged, it can leave the victim unable to speak or understand, whereas equivalent damage to the <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> would cause only minor impairment to language skills.|$|E
25|$|<b>Right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> {{brain damage}} (RHD) {{is the result}} of injury to the right brain hemisphere.

25|$|Treatment for <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> {{damage is}} given by speech-language pathologists. There is not much {{research}} {{that has been done}} regarding the efficacy of treatments for <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> damage. The research that has been done has shown that persons with <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> damage benefit from therapy at both the chronic and acute stages of recovery for language. Research has also shown that treatment given by speech-language pathologists to persons with <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> damage results in improvement in the areas of problem solving, attention, memory, and pragmatics.|$|E
25|$|Most {{language}} {{production and}} processing {{occur in the}} left hemisphere {{while the majority of}} the emotional processing and production of emotion in speech occurs in the <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> Schizophrenic patients usually have difficulty processing prosody. These patients also show a remarkable increase in lateralization towards the <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> of both emotionally and non-emotional prosody rich speech. Also, a decrease in right-handedness led to an increase in the <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> lateralization. This <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> lateralization extends beyond prosody to many of aspects of language and speech processing in schizophrenic patients.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{performance}} on these tests led the scientists {{to believe that}} her brain had lateralized, and that her <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> had undergone specialization. Because Genie's performance was so high on such {{a wide variety of}} tasks predominantly utilizing the <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> of her brain, they concluded her exceptional abilities extended to typical right-hemisphere functions in general and were not specific to any individual task. They attributed her extreme <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> dominance to the fact that what very little cognitive stimulation she did receive was almost entirely visual and tactile. While even this had been extremely minimal it had been enough to commence lateralization in her <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> and the severe imbalance in stimulation caused her <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> to become extraordinarily developed.|$|E

25|$|Damage to {{the left}} {{hemisphere}} in patients results in a marked increase in depression. Valence asymmetry {{may be due to}} more cholinergic and dopaminergic on the left hemisphere and the <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> being more noradrenergic. Patients with <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> damage had reduced arousal response to painful stimuli.|$|E

25|$|Although hemispatial neglect {{has been}} {{identified}} following left hemisphere damage (resulting in the neglect of {{the right side of}} space), it is most common after damage to the <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> This disparity is thought to reflect the fact that the <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> of the brain is specialized for spatial perception and memory, whereas the left hemisphere is specialized for language - there is redundant processing of the right visual fields by both hemispheres. Hence the <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> is able to compensate for the loss of left hemisphere function, but not vice versa.|$|E

While 'Creator' proved to be a valuable tool for Enterprise customers it was never actively marketed as a standalone product for creative media solutions or the visual computing market that lie outside of <b>Right</b> <b>Hemisphereâ€™s</b> core business areas.

25|$|Research has {{indicated}} {{that women are more}} likely to be left hemisphere dominant, and men are more likely to be <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> dominant. Because of this, women recover faster from left hemisphere damage, and men are more likely to recover faster from <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> damage. Men who have suffered a <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> stroke also have significantly better rehabilitation outcomes than men who suffer a left hemisphere stroke. Recovery of functional abilities is often greater in male stroke survivors than females, especially in the area of activities of daily living.|$|E

25|$|While {{this theory}} seems to hold true for some emotions, this theory is {{generally}} considered outdated; however a few examples exist. For example, a study found that when subjects were primed with positive stimuli before hearing a consonant, the left hemisphere was more active than the <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> In contrast, when subjects were primed with a negative stimulus, the <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> was more active than the left hemisphere.|$|E
5000|$|The {{temporal}} lobes are {{a region}} of the cerebral cortex that is located beneath the Sylvian fissure on {{both the left and}} <b>right</b> <b>hemispheres</b> of the brain. [...] Lobes in this cortex are more closely associated with memory and in particular autobiographical memory.|$|R
40|$|In {{the human}} brain, {{the left and}} <b>right</b> <b>hemispheres</b> are anatomically {{asymmetric}} and have distinctive cognitive function, although the molecular basis for this asymmetry {{has not yet been}} characterized. We compared gene expression levels in the perisylvian regions of human left [...] right cortex at fetal weeks 12, 14, and 19 using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). We identified dozens of genes with evidence of differential expression by SAGE and confirmed these by quantitative reverse transcriptase [...] polymerase chain reaction. Most genes with differential levels of expression in the left and <b>right</b> <b>hemispheres</b> function in signal transduction and gene expression regulation during early cortical development. By com-paring genes differentially expressed in left and right fetal brains with those previously reported to be differently expressed in human versus chimpanzee adult brains, we identified a subset of genes that shows evidence of asymmetric expression in humans and altered expression levels between chimps and humans. We also compared the coding sequences of genes differentially expressed between left and <b>right</b> <b>hemispheres</b> and found genes that show both asymmetric expression and evidence of positive evolutionary selection in the primate lineage leading to humans. Our results identify candidate genes involved in the evolution of human cerebral cortical asymmetry...|$|R

25|$|Based {{on these}} results, Bellugi and Klima {{believed}} that Genie had been developing {{as a typical}} right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her. They attributed the imbalance between Genie's hemispheres {{to the fact that}} Genie's sensory input as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile, stimulating functions which are predominantly controlled in the <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> of a right-handed person, and although this input had been extremely minimal it was sufficient to cause their lateralization to the <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> They therefore believed that because Genie had no linguistic input during her childhood, it underwent no specialization whatsoever and as a result her language functions never lateralized to it. Since Genie accurately distinguished speech sounds with her <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> they thought her language functions had lateralized there instead.|$|E

50|$|In {{performing}} the initial experiments, Gazzaniga {{and his colleagues}} observed what happened when the left and <b>right</b> <b>hemispheres</b> in the split brains of patients were unable {{to communicate with each}} other. In these experiments when patients were shown an image within the right visual field (which maps to the left brain hemisphere), an explanation of what was seen could be provided. However, when the image was only presented to the left visual field (which maps to the <b>right</b> brain <b>hemisphere)</b> the patients stated that they didnâ€™t see anything.|$|R
25|$|In one {{series of}} tests, {{it was shown}} that when {{children}} were given verbal fluency tests, a larger portion of their cortex activated compared to adults, as well as activation of {{both the left and}} <b>right</b> <b>hemispheres.</b> This is most likely due to the high plasticity of newly developing brains.|$|R

25|$|Anosognosia {{is a lack}} of {{awareness}} or understanding of the loss of function caused by the brain injury and is common in individuals who have suffered a <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> stroke. Because patients with anosognosia may be unaware of their deficits, they may be less likely to seek treatment once they are released from the hospital. The lack of proper treatment could lead to higher levels of dependency later on. In order to make functional recovery gains, <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> stroke survivors should receive rehabilitation services, so patients with anosognosia should be encouraged to seek out additional treatment. However, due to the anosognosia, these patients often report a higher perceived quality of life than other <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> stroke survivors because of the unawareness of the resulting deficits (Daia et al., 2014). Patients with smaller lesions often recover faster from anosognosia than patients with larger lesions resulting in anosognosia (Hier et al., 1983).|$|E

25|$|Rossi (1977) {{suggests}} that the function and characteristic between left and right cerebral hemispheres may enable us to locate the archetypes in the right cerebral hemisphere. He cites research indicating that left hemispherical functioning is primarily verbal and associational, {{and that of the}} right primarily visuospatial and apperceptive. Thus the left hemisphere is equipped as a critical, analytical, information processor while the <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> operates in a 'gestalt' mode. This means that the <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere</b> is better at getting a picture of a whole from a fragment, is better at working with confused material, is more irrational than the left, and more closely connected to bodily processes. Once expressed in the form of words, concepts and language of the ego's left hemispheric realm, however, they become only representations that 'take their colour' from the individual consciousness. Inner figures such as shadow, anima and animus would be archetypal processes having source in the <b>right</b> <b>hemisphere.</b>|$|E
