25|$|Although not {{designated}} a stealth fighter, measures {{were taken to}} reduce the Typhoon's <b>radar</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> (RCS), especially from the frontal aspect.

Many important potential radar targets, such as the wing, canard and fin leading edges, are highly swept, so will reflect radar energy well away from the front sector. Some external weapons are mounted semi-recessed into the aircraft, partially shielding these missiles from incoming radar waves. In addition radar-absorbent materials (RAM), developed primarily by EADS/DASA, coat many of the most significant reflectors, such as the wing leading edges, the intake edges and interior, the rudder surrounds, and strakes.|$|E
