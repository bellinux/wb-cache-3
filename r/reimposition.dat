Duterte signed Executive Order 26 imposing a smoking ban in public places on May 16, 2017. In the same month, the Duterte administration began to implement the Anti-Distracted Driving Act.

Michael, as Geanaklopos emphasizes, [...] "from 1266 until shortly before his death in 1282 ... was constrained to devote almost complete attention to the defeat of Charles, the fulfillment of whose ambition would have brought about the destruction of the Byzantine Empire and <b>reimposition</b> of Latin rule in Constantinople."

2500|$|Duterte has {{referred}} to the Catholic Church as [...] "the most hypocritical institution", after the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines president Socrates Villegas released a pastoral letter indirectly referring to Duterte as a [...] "morally reprehensible" [...] candidate who has shown [...] "scant regard" [...] {{for the rights of}} others and the teachings of the Church, urging Filipino Catholics to not vote for him. Unlike many prominent conservative politicians, Duterte has spoken in favor of birth control, LGBT rights, and <b>reimposition</b> of the death penalty which was abolished by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, a devout Catholic, during her second term in 2006. Upon being elected, Duterte called local bishops [...] "sons of whores", and said he would expand family planning, which the Church had been opposed to. The Catholic Church in the Philippines had lost much of its popularity and political power since being active in overthrowing the Marcos regime in 1986. Antonio Contreras, {{a political science professor at}} De La Salle University in Manila, said that Duterte's attacks on the Church were likely to prove popular.|$|E
2500|$|Because the ILOs {{enforcement}} and sanction mechanisms are weak, {{there has been}} significant discussion about incorporating labour standards in the World Trade Organisation's operation, since its formation in 1994. The WTO oversees, primarily, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which is a treaty aimed at reducing customs, tariffs and other barriers to free import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157 member countries. Unlike for the ILO, if the WTO rules on trade are contravened, member states who secure a judgment by the Dispute Settlement procedures (effectively a judicial process) may retaliate through trade sanctions. This could include <b>reimposition</b> of targeted tariffs against the non-compliant country. Proponents of an integrated approach {{have called for a}} [...] "social clause" [...] to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example by amending article XX, which gives an exception to the general trade barrier reduction rules allowing imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow action where a WTO member state is found to be in breach of ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could backfire and undermine labour rights, as a country's industries, and therefore its workforce, are necessarily harmed but without any guarantee that labour reform would take place. Furthermore, it was argued in the Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that [...] "the comparative advantage of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question." [...] On this view, countries {{ought to be able to}} take advantage of low wages and poor conditions at work as a comparative advantage in order to boost their exports. It is disputed that business will relocate production to low wage countries from higher wage countries such as the UK, because that choice is said to depend on productivity of workers. However, the view of many labour lawyers and economists remains that more trade, when workers have weaker bargaining power and less mobility, still allows business to opportunistically take advantage of workers by moving production, and that a coordinated multilateral approach with targeted measures against specific exports is preferable. While the WTO has yet to incorporate labour rights into its procedures for dispute settlements, many countries began to make bilateral agreements that protected core labour standards instead. Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations not yet touched by the WTO agreements, countries have given preference to other countries who do respect core labour rights, for example under the EU Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.|$|E

50|$|As the Catholic bishops {{during the}} reign of Queen Mary were dead, imprisoned or in exile, and those priests they had ordained were dying out or {{converting}} to Protestantism, William Allen conceived the idea for a seminary for English Catholic priests at Douai, where several of the chief posts were held by professors who had fled Oxford upon the <b>reimposition</b> of Protestantism in England. The English College at Douai was founded as a Catholic seminary in 1569. Similar colleges also came about at Douai for Scottish and Irish Catholic clergy, and also Benedictine, Franciscan and Jesuit houses.

5000|$|Whilst Haraldr {{was still}} in Norway, the saga states that two leading members of Clann Somhairle arrived at Hákon's court, with each seeking the kingship of the Isles: Eóghan Mac Dubhghaill, Lord of Argyll (died 1268×) and Dubhghall mac Ruaidhrí (died 1268). Although 1247 was also the year of Hákon's royal coronation, and it is {{possible}} that the arrival of the Clann Somhairle dynasts was a result of the <b>reimposition</b> of Norwegian overlordship (as appears to have been the case with Haraldr), there may have been other reasons for the arrival of Eóghan and Dubhghall. For example, 1247 was also the year that a prominent member of Clann Somhairle, called [...] "Mac Somhairle" [...] in Irish sources, was slain in Ireland battling the English. The knighting of Haraldr the year previous may well have entailed some act of submission to the Henry, {{and it is possible}} that Hákon had consequently recognised Mac Somhairle's kingship in the Isles in response to Haraldr's acceptance of English overtures. An alliance with a ruler of the Isles would have certainly benefited Henry's ongoing military operations in Ireland, and it is possible that it was such a pact that had prompted Mac Somhairle's involvement against the English. Haraldr's subsequent marriage to Cecilía, therefore, may have been a successful attempt by Hákon to lure Haraldr back to his side.|$|E
