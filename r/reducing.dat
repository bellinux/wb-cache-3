5|$|As shown above, E. coli {{can grow}} with <b>reducing</b> agents such as formate, hydrogen, or lactate as {{electron}} donors, and nitrate, DMSO, or oxygen as acceptors. The larger {{the difference in}} midpoint potential between an oxidizing and <b>reducing</b> agent, the more energy is released when they react. Out of these compounds, the succinate/fumarate pair is unusual, as its midpoint potential is close to zero. Succinate can therefore be oxidized to fumarate if a strong oxidizing agent such as oxygen is available, or fumarate {{can be reduced to}} succinate using a strong <b>reducing</b> agent such as formate. These alternative reactions are catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Since {{both the}} {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} are used in these linked sets of reactions, the cell maintains significant concentrations of both NAD and NADH, with the high NAD/NADH ratio allowing this coenzyme to act as both an oxidizing and a <b>reducing</b> agent. In contrast, the main function of NADPH is as a <b>reducing</b> agent in anabolism, with this coenzyme being involved in pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and photosynthesis. Since NADPH is needed to drive redox reactions as a strong <b>reducing</b> agent, the NADP/NADPH ratio is kept very low.|$|E
