5|$|Adding to Tony's {{complicated}} life is {{his relationship}} with his wife Carmela (Edie Falco), which is strained by his constant infidelity and her struggle to <b>reconcile</b> <b>the</b> reality of Tony's business (which she is often in denial of), with the affluent lifestyle and higher social status it brings her. Both have up-and-down relationships with their two children: the intelligent-but-rebellious Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler), and underachiever A.J.

At this time Boyce's first wife, Mary, exchanged some of her Chicago property for the home in Ottawa, which sparked speculation that she and Boyce might <b>reconcile.</b> <b>The</b> next year they remarried on June 14, 1913, in Ottawa.

5|$|By the mid 1950s, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of economists had ceased debating Keynesianism and accepted the synthesis view; however, room for disagreement remained.

David nearly drowns (since he cannot swim), but the children rescue him. He then attacks the janitor from behind and strangles him to death while once more remaining uninjured. That night, he and Audrey <b>reconcile.</b> <b>The</b> following morning, he secretly shows a newspaper article on the anonymous heroic act, featuring a sketch of David in his hooded rain poncho, to his son, who recognizes the hero as his father.|$|E
5|$|Déby {{attempted}} to <b>reconcile</b> <b>the</b> rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics. Chadians approved {{a new constitution}} by referendum, and in 1996, Déby easily won a competitive presidential election. He won a second term five years later. Oil exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it hopes that Chad would at last have some chances of peace and prosperity. Instead, internal dissent worsened, and a new civil war broke out. Déby unilaterally modified the constitution to remove the two-term limit on the presidency; this caused an uproar among the civil society and opposition parties.|$|E

It was believed that, with Lumumba dead, it might be possible to create a federal constitution that could <b>reconcile</b> <b>the</b> three parties. The agreements instead led to more uncertainty.

5|$|John Sigismund, {{originally}} Roman Catholic, {{converted to}} Lutheranism {{before the end}} of 1562. However, debates between Lutheran and Calvinist theologians continued. John Sigismund appointed his court physician, Giorgio Biandrata (who as an Anti-Trinitarian did not share either the Lutheran or the Calvinist view) to head a synod to <b>reconcile</b> <b>the</b> Lutheran and the Calvinist clergymen, but their differences proved insuperable in April 1564. The Diet acknowledged the existence of a separate Calvinist denomination in June. John Sigismund also adopted Calvinism and made Ferenc Dávid his court preacher.|$|E

In 1313 he followed Edward II on a state visit to France, and thereafter generally remained a trusted subject. In 1318 he witnessed the Treaty of Leake, which restored Edward to full power.|$|E
