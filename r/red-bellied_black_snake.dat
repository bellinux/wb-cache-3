5|$|Natural predators include wading birds, such as reef egrets, white-faced herons, white ibises and swamp harriers. Other predators include snakes, skinks, red foxes, tortoises, and eels {{and other}} fish, such as redfin perch and European carp, several {{varieties}} of gudgeon, {{and a range}} of invertebrate predators, such as the large brown mantis. Predation on adult frogs has been recorded for the <b>red-bellied</b> <b>black</b> <b>snake,</b> tiger snake, laughing kookaburra, and sacred kingfisher; wading birds and other snakes, such as the green tree snake and the copperhead snake, are also believed to be predators of the frog. The relative magnitude of the various predatorial threats to the frog and its tadpoles is not known. Before the frog became rare, and when subsistence lifestyles were more common, it was hunted and eaten by Australian Aborigines. It was also used in dissection demonstrations in biology classes, and caught by humans for feeding pet reptiles.|$|E

50|$|The venom of <b>red-bellied</b> <b>black</b> <b>snake</b> {{consists}} of neurotoxins, mycotoxins, coagulants {{and also has}} haemolytic properties. Bites from <b>red-bellied</b> <b>black</b> <b>snake</b> are rarely life-threatening, but need of immediate medical attention. Symptoms of systemic envenomation—including nausea, vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea or diaphoresis—were thought to be rare, but a 2010 review found they occurred in most bite victims. Most people also go on to develop an anticoagulant coagulopathy in a few hours. This is characterised by a raised aPTT, and subsides over 24 hours. It resolves quickly with antivenom. A few people go on to develop a myotoxicity and associated generalised muscle pain and occasionally weakness, which may last for up to 7 days.|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a literature review {{to address the}} potential for using a native, vertebrate predator of brown tree snakes (Boiga irregularis) as a biological control method on Guam. Both actual and potential predators were included in our review. We located two actual predators (<b>red-bellied</b> <b>black</b> <b>snakes</b> (Pseudechis porphyriacus) and cane toads (Bufo marinus)) and 55 potential predators of brown tree snakes. However, none of the native predators of brown tree snakes appear likely candidates as a biological control method on Guam due to their lack of selectivity in their feeding habits and unknown aspects of their natural history.

5000|$|Pseudechis guttatus (the blue-bellied <b>black</b> <b>snake</b> or spotted <b>black</b> <b>snake)</b> is {{a species}} of <b>black</b> <b>snake</b> that is only found in the inland areas of {{south-eastern}} Queensland and northern New South Wales. On average, their measurement is 1.25 m, but some snakes {{have been found to}} measure as long as 2 m. Their diet consists of frogs, lizards, and small mammals, therefore making them carnivorous. [...] They, like most other snakes, are oviparous, laying 7-12 eggs during their breeding season. It is unknown what their average venom ejection is. When mice are bitten, the snake's venom is the most toxic of all the <b>black</b> <b>snakes.</b> They are naturally very shy, and will not bite unless provoked (by being stepped on by a boot, prodded by a stick, etc.). If a human is bitten, they may suffer severe pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, diaphoresis and regional lymphadenopathy at the location of the bite, similar to a <b>red-bellied</b> <b>black</b> <b>snake's</b> bite symptoms. Bites are infrequent. If bitten, tiger snake antivenom is the preferred treatment.|$|R

50|$|The suburb is {{surrounded}} by farmland and includes the forested Greenbank Military Range, {{which is on the}} Commonwealth Heritage List. A strip of parkland and a watercourse originally named The Platypus Pools and Bracken Way is a natural habitat for a number of species of flora and fauna including platypus, the rare black cockatoo, kookaburra, the blue wren, kingfisher, honeyeaters, owls, kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, possums, bearded dragons, legless lizards and water monitors up to 2.5 metres in length. Many more species have been sighted living in this natural habitat. The watercourse and natural forest are fed by torrential rains and natural springs dotted throughout the Spring Mountain area, continuing through to Greenbank, Browns Plains and finishing at Karrawatha National Park. Snakes, mostly consisting of python, whip <b>snakes</b> and <b>red-bellied</b> <b>black</b> <b>snakes,</b> and to a much lesser degree brown snakes. Bird-eating spiders, huntsman spiders, redback spiders and the orb-weaver spider also share the watercourse and forest area.|$|R
50|$|Water may be scarce {{away from}} the Nattai River and its {{tributary}} creeks. The area is fairly remote, and few people hike here, so make sure plans are left with a responsible person, and consider taking an EPIRB. Mobile phones may work on the highest parts of the plateau surrounding the valley, but won't work in the valley. Make sure your navigation skills are adequate to route find properly, as fires in the park often clear out undergrowth, which makes finding an indistinct trail nearly impossible (although {{it also means that}} walking is much easier). Beware of snakes, especially sunning themselves on fire roads or trails and near creeks - they won't always move away when you come near, so you may end up getting uncomfortably close to one. <b>Red-bellied</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Snakes</b> are the most common type seen. Make sure you carry snake bandage(s) and know how to use them. Treat all water taken from rivers/creeks - there are towns (e.g. Mittagong) upstream, so there is possible that water is infected with Giardia. Be aware that when there has been recent and/or substantial rainfall there are lots of thorny vines, spiky plants and stinging nettles nearby the river. It is best to have attire that will protect your legs and hands under these circumstances. There are lots of wombat burrows and soil that has been disturbed by wombats.|$|R

40|$|Background: Snakebites in snake {{handlers}} are {{an important}} clinical problem that may differ to bites in the general population. Aim: To investigate the epidemiology and clinical presentation of bites in snake handlers. Design: Prospective observational study. Methods: Bites in snake handlers recruited {{as part of the}} Australian Snakebite Project (ASP) from 2004 to 2011 were included in the study. Data were extracted from the ASP database, which included demographic and clinical information, laboratory tests and antivenom treatment. Results: From 1089 snake bites recruited to ASP, there were 106 (9. 7 %) bites in snake handlers. The median age was 40 years (range: 16 – 81 years) and 104 (98 %) were males. The commonest circumstances of the bites were handling snakes (47), catching snakes (22), feeding snakes (18) and cleaning cages (11). Bites were to the upper limb in 103 cases. Bites were most commonly by <b>Red-bellied</b> <b>black</b> <b>snakes</b> (20), Brown snakes (17), Taipan (15), Tiger snakes (14) and Death adders (14). Envenoming occurred in 77 patients: venom-induced consumption coagulopathy in 45 patients (58 %), neurotoxicity in 10 (13 %) and myotoxicity in 13 (17 %). Systemic hypersensitivity reactions (SHSRs) to venom occurred in eight, satisfying clinical criteria for anaphylaxis in five, of which three were hypotensive. Antivenom was administered in 60 envenomed patients. SHSRs to antivenom occurred in 15 (25 %; 95 % CI: 15 – 38 %), including 2 (3 %: 1 – 13 %) with severe (hypotensive) reactions. Conclusion: Bites in snake handlers remain a common, important problem involving a broad range of snakes. Neurotoxicity and myotoxicity are relatively common, consistent with the snakes involved. Venom anaphylaxis occured, despite previously being a poorly recognized problem in snake handlers. The incidence of SHSRs to antivenoms, including anaphylaxis, was not higher than that observed in non-snake handlers...|$|R
40|$|As a child I {{lived in}} the Blue Mountains of NSW. My house stood a stone’s throw from the Great Western Highway and railway line: noise and bustle, the Indian Pacific, Mack trucks. From our front veranda I gazed up that highway, west, {{all the way to}} Perth, while outside our back fence was a gully. I mucked up, the artful dodger {{escaping}} jobs, turning to outside-the-back-gate. Once in my gully, I was an adventurer or an explorer, maybe even an escaped convict. At the head of the gully was a series of small rock pools surrounded by thick native bush and blackberry and filled with tadpoles, insect larvae and dragonflies. From the rock pools, the creek flowed a few hundred metres before reaching a small waterfall. At the base of this sandstone cliff line there was a cave hidden in the shady bottom of the gully. Here I kept a tarp, billy, matches and a knife. I never got permission to stay in my cave overnight, but from it such bravery was planned. If you struggled down the creek line for about an hour, over slippery and mossy rocks, you came to the Glenbrook Gorge. Here there was much more water: fish and yabbies, sometimes turtles. Big boys told stories of how the trees around these swimming holes were filled with snakes. Snakes so big that they swung from tree to tree and {{from one side of the}} gully to the other. But the truth is that in all the time I spent down there, snakes were a rare spotting: a death adder, a diamond python, a few <b>red-bellied</b> <b>black</b> <b>snakes,</b> that was all. I once saw a wallaby, sometimes echidnas and lyrebirds, lots of blue-tongues and kookaburras. But the bush for me was a place of solitary wanderings. I studied moss, lichens and fungus, carved sandstone, threw rocks, made spears and sucked the honey from Mountain Devils...|$|R
