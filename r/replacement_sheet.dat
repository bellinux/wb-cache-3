40|$|Retinal {{diseases}} such as age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) affect millions of people. Replacing lost cells with new cells that connect with the still functional part of the host retina might repair a degenerating retina and restore eyesight to an unknown extent. A unique model, subretinal transplantation of freshly dissected sheets of fetal-derived retinal progenitor cells, combined with its retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), has demonstrated successful results in both animals and humans. Most other approaches are restricted to rescue endogenous retinal cells of the recipient in earlier disease stages by a 'nursing' role of the implanted cells and are not aimed at neural retinal cell <b>replacement.</b> <b>Sheet</b> transplants restore lost visual responses in several retinal degeneration models in the superior colliculus (SC) corresponding {{to the location of}} the transplant in the retina. They do not simply preserve visual performance - they increase visual responsiveness to light. Restoration of visual responses in the SC can be directly traced to neural cells in the transplant, demonstrating that synaptic connections between transplant and host contribute to the visual improvement. Transplant processes invade the inner plexiform layer of the host retina and form synapses with presumable host cells. In a Phase II trial of RP and ARMD patients, transplants of retina together with its RPE improved visual acuity. In summary, retinal progenitor sheet transplantation provides an excellent model to answer questions about how to repair and restore function of a degenerating retina. Supply of fetal donor tissue will always be limited but the model can set a standard and provide an informative base for optimal cell replacement therapies such as embryonic stem cell (ESC) -derived therapy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The Komshecheh barite-fluorite deposit is {{the product}} of {{epigenetic}} hydrothermal mineralization in dolomitized limestone of Middle Triassic age. The deposit is structurally and lithologically controlled and occurs predominantly as bedded stratabound <b>replacement</b> <b>sheets,</b> although the veins and solution-collapse breccias constitute important modes of occurrence. Brecciation, dolomitization, silicification and mineralization are interrelated. Post-Eocene intrusions and NW-SE and NE-SW trending faults are important ore controls. The ore mineralogy is simple and consists of barite and fluorite with very minor galena, pyrite, chalcopyrite, malachite and azurite. Sulfides are extremely rare in the deposit. At least two episodes of deposition have been identified: an early stage of fluorite precipitation and a later barite-fluorite mineralization event with spatial and temporal variations in salinity and temperature. Thermometric investigations indicate that homogenization temperatures (TH) for primary and pseudosecondary fluid inclusions in the fluorite range from 89 to 244 °C with a mode at 150 °C, whereas those for primary fluid inclusions in barite range from 119 to 323 °C with two modes at 150 and 250 °C. Evidence for boiling is seen during barite deposition. The mean salinities measured are 12 and 10 equivalent weight percent NaCl for fluids in fluorite and barite, respectively. Hydrocarbons in the inclusions hosted by fluorite samples were also detected. Chemical analyses of fluids extracted from inclusions in fluorite and barite show composition...|$|R

40|$|Over 250, 000 {{people in}} the United States {{currently}} live with a spinal cord injury and approximately 11, 000 new cases occur every year. People with spinal cord injuries experience {{a significant reduction in}} quality of life due to the many problems that arise from damage to the spinal cord including paralysis and loss of sensation below the location of injury, loss of bowel and bladder function, loss of sexual function, and impaired respiration. Despite considerable ongoing {{research in the area of}} nerve regeneration by various institutions, satisfactory treatment for spinal cord injury has not yet been discovered. Previous studies have had considerable success in facilitating the regeneration of severed peripheral nerves through the use of collagen based implants used to bridge the resulting gap between the severed nerve stumps. The current study aims to apply this same regenerative approach to a defect created in the spinal cord of adult rats. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy of three different collagen implants toward the regeneration of the spinal cord. The experimental spinal cord injury was a complete transection at T 7 and T 9 and the removal of the spinal cord segment between the two transections, creating a 5 mm gap. (cont.) This study contained four experimental groups. Group I was the control group. The animals in this group had a complete spinal cord transection as described above but received no implantation. Group II received a resorbable dura <b>replacement</b> <b>sheet</b> of collagen, 1 mm thick, cut from the BioGide(® membrane which was placed extradurally over the dorsal aspect of the wound site. Group III used the BioGide® membrane as a wrap which bridged the gap between the two cord stumps. Group IV used a collagen tube, fabricated using a freeze-drying process, to bridge the gap. Histological analysis at 6 weeks after implantation showed Groups III and IV to have more longitudinally oriented reparative tissue filling the defect area as well as fewer fluid-filled cysts. Quantitative analysis of axonal regeneration showed the collagen implants to be supportive of the regeneration of axons into the center of the defect. by Rahmatullah H. Cholas. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|M. Sc. The Pering Pb-Zn deposit is hosted in the stromatolitic dolomites of the Campbellrand Subgroup of the Ghaap Group, Transvaal Supergroup. The deposit is {{situated}} 20 km {{northeast of the}} town Reivilo in the semi-arid region of the Northwest Province, South Africa. It has been classified as a Mississippi Valley type deposit and is, together with the Bushy Park Pb-Zn deposit and F-Pb-Zn deposits near Zeerust, the only known MVT deposit of Paleoproterozoic age. The Pering open cast mine has been operational since 1986, yielding 18 Mt at an average ore grade of 3. 6 wt. % Zn and 0. 6 wt. % Pb. The {{aim of this study}} is to devise a metallogenetic model by integrating core logging, petrography, fluid inclusion and stable C- 0 -S isotope studies. The mineralogy includes sphalerite, galena and minor chalcopyrite as ore minerals, with diagenetic pyrite, hydrothermal dolomite, quartz and calcite as gangue minerals. Sphalerite predominates over galena. Mineralisation occurs as (a) disseminated stratabound <b>replacements</b> <b>sheets</b> restricted mainly to stromatolitic zones of the Steekdorings Member of the Reivilo Formation, and as (b) open space infill in breccia bodies that cross-cut the stratigraphy. Three events of hydrothermal brecciation, resultant of prolonged pulses of fluid infiltration, and mineralisation are recognised. The first brecciation event is marked by the cementation of the dolomite host rock by sparry dolomite, closely associated with finegrained disseminated sphalerite and galena. The second brecciation event is of minor importance, and is marked by the formation of small amounts of the second sphalerite generation, while the third, and final, brecciation event is marked by the formation of euhedral sphalerite, galena, quartz, sparry dolomite, and calcite as open space fill...|$|R
40|$|Background: Histiocytic or xanthogranulomatous endometritis, {{characterized}} by disappearance of endometrial mucosa and its <b>replacement</b> by <b>sheets</b> of lipid containing histiocytic cells, is very rare. Extensive internet and PubMed search-es revealed only 19 cases reported to date. The pathogenesis of histiocytic endometritis {{seems to be}} inflam-mation due to post-menopausal cervical stenosis or {{as the result of}} cervical carcinoma. Histiocytic endometri-tis can infiltrate the myometrium and can mimic a malignancy. Case Report: We report the case of a 78 -year-old post-menopausal female with symptoms of vaginal discharge, fever, and weakness. Radiological investigation showed a mass lesion in the cervix, extending into the myometrium, sug-gestive of cervical carcinoma. The lesion was biopsied and histopathological examination led to the diagnosis of histiocytic endometritis with no evidence of malignancy. Conclusions: Histiocytic endometritis, an inflammatory pathology, can mimic malignancy clinically as well as radiologically. Histopathological examination with extensive sampling of tissue is essential because presence of endometri-tis does not rule out malignancy.

40|$|Xanthogranulomatous {{pyelonephritis}} (XGP) is {{an uncommon}} form of granulomatous inflammation characterized by {{destruction of the}} renal parenchyma and <b>replacement</b> by solid <b>sheets</b> of lipid-laden macrophages.

50|$|A {{quarter panel}} (British English: rear wing) {{is the body}} panel (exterior surface) of an {{automobile}} between a rear door (or only door on each side for two-door models) and the trunk (boot) and typically wraps around the wheel well. The similar front section between {{the door and the}} hood (bonnet), is called a fender, but is sometimes incorrectly also referred to as a quarter panel. Quarter panels are typically made of sheet metal, but are sometimes made of fiberglass, carbon fiber, or fiber-reinforced plastic. A quarter panel is typically a welded-on component of the unibody structure. <b>Replacement</b> of a <b>sheet</b> metal quarter panel typically requires it to be cut off the vehicle and a replacement part to be welded (or sometimes bonded) to the vehicle. Due to the high amount of specialized labor, a quarter panel may often be repaired rather than replaced by hammering the damaged area to a relatively flat surface and then applying a body filler to smooth out the damaged area to match the original surface. The panel is then usually painted and often clear coated.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Replacement {{dolomite}} in the Latemar carbonate buildup, northern Italy, {{formed when}} limestone was infiltrated by and reacted with Mg-rich fluid. It occurs in discrete bodies in sharp contact with unreacted limestone. The dolomite {{developed in a}} nearly orthogonal lattice of vertical columns (replacement of limestone breccia pipes) and <b>sheets</b> (<b>replacement</b> along fractures and limestone-dike contacts) and of nearly horizontal bedding-parallel sheets and tubes. Mapped patterns of replacement dolomite directly image {{that part of the}} plumbing system in which the amount of fluid flow was sufficient to form dolomite. Decreases in the proportion of dolomite relative to limestone and in the proportion of vertical relative to horizontal dolomite-limestone contacts with increasing elevation indicate that the overall direction of fluid flow was upward and then outward along more permeable bedding horizons. Dolomite is significantly enriched in Fe, Mn, and Zn, as well as in Mg, relative to calcite in precursor limestone but not in Cu, Ni, Co, Cr, Ba, or Pb. The Fe, Mn, and Zn content of dolomite varies spatially within outcrops from the scale of meters down to the micron scale of oscillatory growth zoning in individual dolomite crystals. Th...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the need for fossil fuels for transport, {{alternative}} ways of meeting the energy demand for transport are required. The Province of Friesland in The Netherlands has developed into a niche sector for Photovoltaic (PV) boats among others to also reduce CO 2 emissions in transport. Examples of the design of PV boats show different configurations considering installed PV power in the range of 1 kilowatt to several tens of kilowatts and as such differences in performance. This situation has led to the starting point of my research that the development and design of PV boats has not matured well enough yet and for that reason designers may need support to create better performing PV boats. As a result from this research, a model has been developed to determine specific values for these performance indicators of PV boats, which has been implemented in a tool for Rhinoceros. The model is composed of a linear sequence of irradiation models, PV module models and battery models, and a hull resistance model. These models are integrated in a tool which is a plug-in for Rhinoceros. Autonomous electric propulsion in boats by PV power sets specific requirements to the integration of Crystalline Silicon (c-Si) cells in boat surfaces. Light weight and flexibility of shape as well as endurance are required for successful PV-powered boat design. The weight of conventional PV modules was identified as a bottleneck for good performing PV boats. Therefore, 15 polymers have been evaluated, to embed PV cells in polymers which might be suitable as <b>replacement</b> of glass <b>sheets</b> while still providing the protection PV cells require...|$|R
