40|$|Groundwater is {{the only}} fresh water {{resource}} in the semi-arid to hyper-arid Western Dead Sea catchment. Due to exploitation of groundwater the water level is decreasing in the surrounding Cretaceous aquifer system and sustainable water management is {{needed in order to}} prevent the progressive yields and contamination of those water resources. In addition, the water level of the Dead Sea decreases dramatically by at least one meter per year. This is connected to channel off the water from the Jordan River to supply intensive agriculture in the semi-arid to hyper-arid region. Hydrological and hydro-geological analysis and modelling in arid regions, like the study area, frequently suffer from data scarcity and uncertainties regarding rainfall and discharge measurements. The study showed that spatial and temporal interpolations as well as additional methods (e. g. empirical relationships and simultaneous numerical approaches) were suitable tools to overcome data shortage for modelling. Water balances are the result of a calibrated model and are the basis for sustainable management of surface and subsurface water resources. The present study investigates beside the hydrological characterisation of selected sub-catchments (wadis) also the hydro-geology of the Judean limestone aquifer and calculates a comprehensive water balance of the entire western flank of the Dead Sea by the application of two numerical open source codes: OpenGeoSys (OGS) and J 2000 g. The calibrated two-dimensional hydrological model J 2000 g provides a 33 years time series of temporal and spatial distributed groundwater recharge for the numerical groundwater flow model of OGS.

40|$|Groundwater {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of fresh water in the Middle East, with {{millions}} of cubic meters of water pumped from aquifers each year. The annual abstraction rates are increasing constantly in order to meet the rising demand, driven by an increasing population and climate change. As a result of these variables, over-pumping may occur, leading to unsustainable resource use. In order to inform management approaches, we quantified such effects for trans-boundary groundwater, namely the Western Aquifer Basin (WAB), using the Water Evaluation and Planning tool (WEAP) coupled to the groundwater model MODFLOW. The keyfindings were that the aquifer’s inflow is dominated by rainfall over the <b>replenishment</b> <b>areas</b> with an annual average of 373 MCM/yr during the period 1951 - 2007. The annual recharge is directly correlated with monthly rainfall, where the largest recharge occurred whenever the most annual rainfall is received between November and February.

Under climate change and reduced recharge conditions, two actions could be taken: a) Immediate Action: reducing the average pumping rate to 221 MCM/yr and b) Stepwise Action: limiting the pumping rate to the 7 -year moving average (average pumping rate: 254 MCM/yr) ...|$|R

40|$|For {{the years}} 1999 - 2003, we {{estimate}} the time-varying perennial ice zone (PIZ) coverage and construct the annual cycles of multiyear (MY, including second year) ice {{coverage of the}} Arctic Ocean using QuikSCAT backscatter, MY fractions from RADARSAT, and the record of ice export from satellite passive microwave observations. An area balance approach extends the winter MY coverage from QuikSCAT to {{the remainder of the}} year. From these estimates, the coverage of MY ice {{at the beginning of each}} year is 3774 x 10 (exp 3) sq km (2000), 3896 x 10 (exp 3) sq km (2001), 4475 x 10 (exp 3) sq km (2002), and 4122 x 10 (exp 3) sq km (2003). Uncertainties in coverage are approx. 150 x 10 (exp 3) sq km. In the mean, on 1 January, MY ice covers approx. 60 % of the Arctic Ocean. Ice export reduces this coverage to approx. 55 % by 1 May. From the multiple annual cycles, the area of first-year (FY) ice that survives the intervening summers are 1192 x 10 (exp 3) sq km (2000), 1509 x 10 (exp 3) sq km (2001), and 582 x 10 (exp 3) sq km (2002). In order for the MY coverage to remain constant from year to year, these <b>replenishment</b> <b>areas</b> must balance the overall area export and melt during the summer. The effect of the record minimum in Arctic sea ice area during the summer of 2002 is seen in the lowest area of surviving FY ice of the three summers. In addition to the spatial coverage, the location of the PIZ is important. One consequence of the unusual location of the PIZ at the end of the summer of 2002 is the preconditioning for enhanced export of MY ice into the Barents and Kara seas. Differences between the minimums in summer sea ice coverage from our estimates and passive microwave observations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2007. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 73 - 79). vii, 79 leaves, bound 29 cmZebrasoma flavescens {{is one of}} 80 species {{within the}} surgeonfish family Acanthuridae (Nelson, 2006). Acanthurids are gonochoristic and primarily herbivorous, and are found in coral reef habitats in tropical and subtropical seas, although they are absent in the Mediterranean (Nelson, 2006). Zebrasoma flavescens (the yellow tang) and several other surgeonfish species are common on most reefs in the Hawai'ian islands, including an exceptionally large population along the Kona coast of the Big Island of Hawai'i. In fact, local mythology suggests that the nickname 'Gold Coast' is {{in reference to the}} many golden-colored fishes visible in the shallow waters of Kona, thanks to the prevalence of yellow tangs. Yellow tang provide 70. 5 % of the total catch for the aquarium trade in the state of Hawai'i, and the majority of these fish are taken from the Kona (west) side of Hawai'i island (Hawai'i Division of Aquatic Resources, unpublished data, FY 2006). At the urging of local interests, whose intentions were to protect coral reef fish targeted for the aquarium trade, the state legislature established a network of nine separate Fish <b>Replenishment</b> <b>Areas</b> (FRAs) on the Kona coast of Hawai'i in 2000. Currently, these protected areas, where aquarium fishing is prohibited, encompass over 30 % of the total western coastline. Since the inception of the FRA network, the Hawai'i Division of Aquatic Resources (HOAR) has been charged with maintaining populations of popular reef species, including the yellow tang, at levels that satisfy fishing interests, the burgeoning snorkel/scuba diving industry, and local conservationists. Information regarding the basic reproductive biology of a species can contribute to developing appropriate fishing regulations in terms of both location and season. The purpose of this research was to elucidate the timing and seasonality of yellow tang spawning along the Kona coast, and to use this information to estimate the reproductive potential of adult females within the population...|$|R

40|$|In {{recognition}} of the scenic, ecological, and scientific values of the marine environment, attempts at conservation are increasingly recognized. In a world progressively modified by human activities, the conservation of biodiversity is essential as insurance to maintain resilient ecosystems and ensure a sustainable flow of ecosystems goods and services to society. Unfamiliarity with large disturbances that rarely occur {{has resulted in the}} neglect of this kind of event in reserve management. Cyclones are extremely powerful events that can damage coastal and marine environments like coral reefs by generating large wave forces, sediment resuspension and subsequent smothering, influx of large volumes of freshwater and terrestrial sediment due to heavy rains, and winds and storm surge. For example, in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), a lack of knowledge about large natural disturbances like cyclones and their effect on the marine environment has prevented managers of the Marine Park from explicitly considering such perturbations in planning. The goal {{of this study was to}} place what is known about widespread natural disturbances (tropical cyclones) into the context of marine reserve design requirements and management decision for the conservation of the GBR, Australia. To do so, the newly implemented Representative Area Program (RAP) of the GBR Marine Park (GBRMP) was evaluated against the recently characterised tropical cyclone disturbance regime across the region (Puotinen, 2005 a). Recruitment to reefs by settlement of distant larvae via a series of short steps within and between reefs is a key process towards reef recovery. It was then assumed that the reefs that are highly protected (HPR) from human activities should also be relatively cyclone-free, to allow them to act as ‘sources’ of larvae to enable recovery of less protected adjacent reefs after disturbances. The level of cyclone disturbances at HPR was characterised based on its frequency and timing, and its influence on connectivity between HPR (source) and non-HPR (sink) reefs across the GBR. Even though most HPRs have had time to recover fully between tropical cyclone events at least once over the last 35 years, they typically had a short time to recover between subsequent cyclone events (short recovery periods). Thus, they may not always be available as ‘sources’ of larvae in a given year, which reduces the effective connectivity between sources and sink reefs in that cyclone disturbance regime. Under such scenario, the RAP may not adequately protect the GBR. This is the case because HPR (potentially representing the best source for support and <b>replenishment</b> of adjacent <b>areas)</b> have not been placed to ensure infrequent exposure to cyclone damage. Because reserves are usually meant to be permanent, their design must be effective even under conditions that may be very different from current conditions. In this context, it is important to consider the history of disturbance in a region as it may determine the level of complexity or fragility that this region can develop between disturbance events. The RAP was developed with the best information available at the time, but the characterisation of the GBR cyclone disturbance regime now available (Poutinen, 2005 a) suggests that the timing of the most recent cyclone event is not typical of the 1969 - 2003 time series. Thus, an ‘insurance’ factor based on Allison et al. (2003) was complied to identify how much additional reef area would need to be set aside to allow for the creation of a new framework accommodating the reality of cyclone disturbance in marine reserve planning. Overall, only for short recovery times (5 - 10 years) and ecosystem level connectivity between source and sink reefs can a sufficient additional insurance reserve be realistically set aside to provide a buffer against cyclone disturbance. One solution to this may be to create temporary dynamic reserves as needed after severe cyclones. The effectiveness of such measures over the long-term will depend not only on the occurrence and magnitude of other disturbances that may develop synergistically to create more dramatic effects on reefs but also on global climate change. Predicting effects of directional climate change will facilitate the evaluation of the long-term success of a reserve...|$|R
40|$|Many Italian beaches {{are today}} {{subjected}} to erosion and several techniques {{can be suggested}} for their defence and reconstruction. In general, approaches producing minimal environmental degradation are presently favoured, such as artificial nourishment of the beach using sandy sediments. The {{purpose of this study}} is to demonstrate how to locate potential deposits along the continental shelf and how to articulate the chances of a successful beach <b>replenishment</b> program. The <b>area</b> where potentially extractive sandy bodies were searched, is located in the central Tyrrhenian continental shelf, between the rocky headland of Ansedonia and the coastal lake of Lago di Burano (Southern Tuscany). The beaches selected for possible artificial nourishments are those of Tombolo di Feniglia, Marina di Tarquinia, Ladispoli and Ostia (Central Italy). In the above-mentioned shelf area, high resolution seismic and sedimentological data highlight a Holocene depositional sequence, which is bounded by the present bathymetric surface and by the unconformity of the last-glacial lowstand. This sequence comprehends highstand (HST) and transgressive (TST) systems tracts. The HST is relatively thin and in the study area consists of a lateral succession of three sedimentary facies: (1) distal part of the modern coastal prism, (2) Posidonia mats, and (3) recent drape deposit (sandy and muddy). The underlying TST is bounded at the bottom by the lowstand unconformity and is abundantly made up of mineable sandy deposits. These deposits are organized in three vertical sequence of facies, each located on a specific shelf zone parallel to the coast. (1) Facies Sequence A, on the external shelf zone, is 1 - 3 m thick and consists of a sand sheet, deriving from the destruction of an ancient beach complex via shoreface retreat processes. (2) Facies Sequence B, on the middle shelf zone, is 3 - 5 m thick and comprises three facies. The lower facies (above the unconformity) is a 1 m thick muddy coastal-marsh deposit, the middle one consists of a 2 - 4 m thick sandy body deriving from the coalescence of several washover fans, and the upper facies is the same sand sheet belonging to the Sequence A. (3) Facies Sequence C, on the inner shelf zone, refers only to the lack of transgressive deposits. Where present, they consist of very sporadic and scattered palimpsest sands (belonging to the sand sheet facies). Further TST evidence, not linked to the above facies sequences, is a partially eroded beach lithosome, which is present close to the Formiche di Burano island. The Sand extraction from the TST deposit was evaluated calculating the volume of material required (a) for 50 m enlargement of all the selected beaches and (b) for their decennial maintenance by minor nourishments. These estimes were obtained respectively by using the surface/volume ratio (one square foot of the beach surface corresponds to one cubic yard of material) and the deficit in the sedimentary budgets (previously deduced by the recent shoreline variations). As TST and beach sediments were different in grain size, the resulting values were then corrected by the James fill factor (estime of point a) and the nourishment factor (point b). This additional procedure is based on mean grain size and sorting statistics of composite samples, representative of the TST and each beach sediment. The final volumes for both reconstruction and decennial maintenance of Tombolo di Feniglia (SW and SE sectors), Marina di Tarquinia, Ladispoli and Ostia beaches were estimated at 1, 461, 951 m 3, 1, 745, 303 m 3, 899, 000 m 3, 2, 411, 014 m 3 and 6, 249, 111 m 3 respectively. Geometry and facies distribution of the TST suggest that the best zone for mining is located past the external limit of the Posidonia oceanica colony. Five possibilities are proposed for material extraction: (1) an extensive excavation over the entire TST, obtaining an amount of 106, 000, 000 m 3; (2) a superficial excavation approximately 2 m in depth over the sand sheet facies, for an amount of 84, 600, 000 m 3; (3) mining on the entire TST, between the external limit of the Posidonia area and the 35 m isobath (zone 1), to obtain 52, 200, 000 m 3; (4) a surface drag in the area previously described, but only 2 m in depth, producing 30, 900, 000 m 3 of sediment from the sand sheet facies, and (5) mining, 2 m in depth and seaward the 35 m isobath (zone 2), creating 53, 800, 000 m 3 from the sand sheet facies. Any of the above mentioned scenarios could satisfy the sediment quantities required for the reconstruction of all the selected beaches. In any case, potential damage to the nearby Posidonia oceanica colony strongly requires an environmental impact investigation...|$|R
