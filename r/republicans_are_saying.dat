5000|$|It's a punt. I mean, it's {{one more}} {{occasion}} where Congress has basically punted, kicked the can down the road, use what metaphor you want. It cuts $21 {{billion out of}} the 2012 budget, {{which is the only}} budget over which this Congress actually has any authority ... The Democrats are saying no cuts to entitlements. The <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> no taxes. That's great except we all know the only solution to our long-term debt problem is cuts in entitlements and new taxes.|$|E
5000|$|On {{domestic}} issues, Thornberry has {{pressed for}} {{repeal of the}} estate tax and also tax credits to encourage production of oil in marginal wells. In 2010, he got a bill into law expanding access to state veterans’ homes to parents whose children died while serving in the military. He introduced a bill in January 2011 to help states set up special health care courts staffed by judges with expertise in the subject. The judges would serve {{as an alternative to}} juries that <b>Republicans</b> <b>say</b> <b>are</b> inclined to award unnecessarily large damage amounts in malpractice cases." ...|$|R
500|$|Soon, {{newspapers}} {{across the}} country picked up the story. Reactions varied widely. In Massachusetts, the Lowell Courier published its opinion that, with women's equality, [...] "the lords must wash the dishes, scour up, {{be put to the}} tub, handle the broom, darn stockings." [...] In St. Louis, Missouri, the Daily Reveille trumpeted that [...] "the flag of independence has been hoisted for the second time {{on this side of the}} Atlantic." [...] Horace Greeley in the New York Tribune wrote [...] "When a sincere <b>republican</b> <b>is</b> asked to <b>say</b> in sober earnest what adequate reason he can give, for refusing the demand of women to an equal participation with men in political rights, he must answer, None at all. However unwise and mistaken the demand, it is but the assertion of a natural right, and such must be conceded." ...|$|R
5000|$|Democrats and The Daily Shows Jon Stewart {{have criticized}} the {{proposals}} as recycled ideas from the Bush administration. Economist Paul Krugman criticized the document for denouncing deficits but calling for tax cuts (which he notes would add $3.7 trillion over the first ten years after its enactment) without specific spending cuts: [...] "In essence, what <b>Republicans</b> <b>say</b> <b>is,</b> Deficits are a terrible thing. Lets make them much bigger." [...] Other commentators agreed that [...] "the numbers dont remotely add up" [...] and that the Pledge [...] "should {{be read as a}} plan to explode debt through the ceiling." [...] Keith Boykin cited a lack of ethnic diversity in the photographs accompanying the Pledge to America, calling it a pledge [...] "to White America." ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the recent}} feud between Treffinger and Kevin J. O’Toole, {{published}} reports say that Pappas {{had agreed to}} deliver Union County Republican delegates to Treffinger in a special election for the Senate. In exchange, the same sources say, Treffinger had agreed to back Pappas for the State Assembly in a primary against O’Toole. A Republican close to O’Toole said that Pappas has worn out his welcome in Essex {{and that he is}} not a factor in the race to succeed O’Toole in the Assembly. His campaign, one Essex County <b>Republican</b> insider <b>says,</b> <b>is</b> simply posturing for a patronage job, and that Pappas feels that the longer he stays in the race, the higher his price will become.|$|R
5000|$|After the 2012 election, {{there was}} {{speculation}} about Schock's ambitions for higher political office, including a Roll Call article noting that Schock's new district in central Illinois had been drawn, during redistricting after the 2010 census, {{to be very}} safe, leading to suggestions that Democrats were trying to keep him happy in the House and away from any statewide bid. An Illinois <b>Republican</b> <b>was</b> quoted as <b>saying,</b> [...] "I {{think he would be}} the top candidate on the Republican side if Dick Durbin retired or if he wanted to run for governor ... His ability to fundraise and be popular with conservatives without coming across as an ideologue would suit him well if he chooses to run." [...] In November 2012, it was reported that Schock had met with officials at the Republican Governors Association to explore the possibility of running for Governor of Illinois in 2014. However, in April 2013, Schock announced {{that he would not be}} running for governor, and would instead be seeking election to a fourth term in Congress.|$|R
5000|$|As of November 30, 2012, Obama {{was calling}} for an {{undeclared}} amount of spending cuts, $1.6 trillion in higher taxes over ten years, and cuts of $400 billion from Medicare and other benefit programs over a decade. Obama also wanted [...] "an extension of the 2 percentage point payroll tax cut" [...] and spending of [...] "at least $50 billion" [...] in 2013 [...] "to boost the economy." [...] Although Democratic Congresspersons have in general supported President Obama's proposal, its November version {{was based on the}} President's 2013 budget proposal, which <b>Republicans</b> <b>say</b> <b>was</b> rejected unanimously in both the House and the Senate earlier in 2012. In March, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that the bill proposed by House Republicans for a vote [...] "was a caricature of the President's budget, so we voted against it." ...|$|R

The Earth Day people utilize a jedi mind trick to make the townspeople not only believe that all they <b>say</b> <b>is</b> correct, while that which conservatives <b>say</b> <b>is</b> slander, but to also build for them a massive Earth Day celebration. When Stan says [...] "My dad is a {{geologist}} and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming", they answer [...] "That's not true, global warming {{is going to kill}} us all.
