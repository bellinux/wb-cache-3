5000|$|Giacinto Scoles {{moved to}} Princeton University in 1986. One of the {{experiments}} that Scoles brought to Princeton was the study of IR spectroscopy of molecules attached to inert gas clusters, particularly Ar and Xe clusters. In this work, he developed the now widely used “pickup technique” 6 {{and set the stage}} for his later pioneering work on superfluid helium nanodroplets, for which he recently shared the Benjamin Franklin Award in Physics. The helium experiments, started with students S. Goyal and D. Schutt, provided the first molecular spectra of solutes in liquid helium, a unique superfluid solvent 7. Frank Stienkemeier joined the group as a postdoc and together with graduate students John Higgins and Carlo Callegari (and sabbatical visitor Wolfgang Ernst) established the “Alkali age” of the group which provided a rich vein to explore chemical dynamics in this fascinating state of mater 8. Graduate student James <b>Reho</b> brought time resolved spectroscopy techniques into the mix 9. Erik Kerstel did a thesis on subdoppler spectroscopy of hydrogen bonded complexes, including the first such spectra in the vibrational overtone region 10. Brooks Pate brought Scoles and Kevin K. Lehmann together for what proved to be a long series of experiments (and many Ph.D. theses) that characterized Intramolecular Vibrational energy Redistribution. They first studied the hydrogen stretching fundamental and first overtone spectral regions and observed Lorentzian lineshapes due to irreversible relaxation for large molecules with a very high density of states 11. They developed IR-microwave and later IR-IR double resonance methods to provide unambiguous quantum assignments of even highly congested spectra and to reach higher in energy 12. The work by Andrea Callegari on benzene, long a model system for such studies is noted among many such studies. After this work, Carlo Callegari converted the apparatus into a helium droplet machine, which was used for the first study of overtone vibrational transitions in helium nanodroplets. Also, the pure rotational spectra of HCCCN and HCN in helium were observed 13. This established that a single droplet could absorb several thousand photons without [...] "optically pumping" [...] out of resonance.|$|E

Recently, surface-based <b>ReHo</b> {{was developed to}} reduce the intersubject variability and to increase statistical power. The present study used this novel surface-based <b>ReHo</b> approach to explore the brain functional activity differences between first-episode, drug-naive MDD patients and healthy controls. Methods. Thirty-three first-episode, drug-naive MDD patients and 32 healthy controls participated in structural and resting-state fMRI scans. MDD patients were rated with a 17 -item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression prior to the scan. Results. In comparison with the healthy controls, MDD patients showed reduced surface-based <b>ReHo</b> in the left insula. There was no increase in surface-based <b>ReHo</b> in MDD patients. The surface-based <b>ReHo</b> value in the left insula was not significantly correlated with the clinical information or the depressive scores in the MDD group. Conclusions. The decreased surface-based <b>ReHo</b> in the left insula in MDD {{may lead to the}} abnormal top-down cortical-limbic regulation of emotional and cognitive information.

40|$|Previous work {{exhibited}} different brain {{grey matter}} volume (GMV) changes between patients with early adult onset depression (EOD, age 18 - 29) and later adult onset depression (LOD, age 30 - 44) by using 30 -year-old as the cut-off age. To identify whether regional homogeneity (<b>ReHo)</b> changes are also different between EOD and LOD by using same cut-off age, we used resting-state functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to detect the abnormal <b>ReHo</b> between patients with EOD and LOD in the present study. Resting-state fMRI scans of 58 patients with EOD, 62 patients with LOD, 60 young healthy controls (HC), and 52 old HC were obtained. The <b>ReHo</b> approach was used to analyze the images. The ANOVA analysis revealed that the <b>ReHo</b> values in the frontoparietal, occipital, and cerebellar regions were significantly different among the four groups. Relative to patients with LOD, patients with EOD displayed significantly increased <b>ReHo</b> in the left precuneus, and decreased <b>ReHo</b> in the right fusiform. The <b>ReHo</b> values in the left precuneus and the right fusiform had no significant correlation with the score of the depression rating scale or illness duration in both patient subgroups. Compared to young HC, patients with EOD showed significantly increased <b>ReHo</b> in the right frontoparietal regions and the right calcarine. Furthermore, the increased <b>ReHo</b> in the right frontoparietal regions, right insula and left hippocampus, and decreased <b>ReHo</b> in the left inferior occipital gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus, left calcarine, and left supplementary motor area were observed in patients with LOD when compared to old HC. The <b>ReHo</b> of brain areas that were related to mood regulation was changed in the first-episode, drug-naive adult patients with MDD. Adult patients with EOD and LOD exhibited different <b>ReHo</b> abnormalities relative to each age-matched comparison group, suggesting that depressed adult patients with different age-onset might have different pathological mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Resting state-fMRI {{studies have}} found that the inter-areal {{correlations}} in cortical networks concentrate within ultra-low frequencies (0. 01 – 0. 04 Hz) while long-distance connections within subcortical networks distribute over a wider frequency range (0. 01 – 0. 14 Hz). However, the frequency characteristics of regional homogeneity (<b>ReHo)</b> in different areas are still unclear. To examine the <b>ReHo</b> properties in different frequency bands, a data-driven method, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), was adopted to decompose the time series of each voxel into several components with distinct frequency bands. <b>ReHo</b> values in each of the components were then calculated. Our results showed that <b>ReHo</b> in cortical areas were higher and more frequency-dependent than those in the subcortical regions. BOLD oscillations of 0. 02 – 0. 04 Hz mainly contributed to the cortical <b>ReHo,</b> whereas the <b>ReHo</b> in limbic areas involved a wider frequency range and were dominated by higher-frequency BOLD oscillations (. 0. 08 Hz). The frequency characteristics of <b>ReHo</b> are distinct between different parts of the striatum, with the frequency band of 0. 04 – 0. 1 Hz contributing the most to <b>ReHo</b> in caudate nucleus, and oscillations lower than 0. 02 Hz contributing more to <b>ReHo</b> in putamen. The distinct frequency-specific <b>ReHo</b> properties of different brain areas may arise from the assorted cytoarchitecture or synaptic types in these areas.

However, the brain regional homogeneity (<b>ReHo)</b> alterations specific to AVHs of schizophrenia remain unclear. In the current study, we aimed to investigate <b>ReHo</b> alterations specific to schizophrenic AVHs. Methods: Thirty-five schizophrenic patients with AVH, 41 schizophrenic patients without AVHs, and fifty healthy subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. <b>ReHo</b> differences across the three groups were tested using a voxel-wise analysis. Results: Compared with the healthy control group, the two schizophrenia groups showed significantly increased <b>ReHo</b> in the right caudate and inferior temporal gyrus and decreased <b>ReHo</b> in the bilateral postcentral gyrus and thalamus and the right inferior occipital gyrus (false discovery rate corrected, P < 0. 05). More importantly, the AVH group exhibited significantly increased <b>ReHo</b> in the left precuneus compared with the non-AVH group. However, using correlation analysis, we did not find any correlation between the auditory hallucination rating scale score and the <b>ReHo</b> of brain regions.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Early-onset Parkinson’s disease (EOPD) is {{distinct}} from late-onset PD (LOPD) {{as it relates to}} the clinical profile and response to medication. The objective is to investigate whether characteristics of spontaneous brain activity in the resting state are associated with the age of disease onset. Methods: We assessed the correlation between neural activity and age-at-onset in a sample of 39 PD patients (18 EOPD and 21 LOPD) and 37 age-matched normal control subjects. Regional homogeneity (<b>ReHo)</b> approaches were employed using ANOVA with two factors: PD and age. Results: In the comparisons between LOPD and EOPD, EOPD revealed lower <b>ReHo</b> values in the right putamen gyrus and higher <b>ReHo</b> values in the left superior frontal gyrus. Compared with age-matched control subjects, EOPD exhibited lower <b>ReHo</b> values in the right putamen and higher <b>ReHo</b> values in the left inferior temporal gyrus; however, LOPD showed lower <b>ReHo</b> values in the right putamen and left insula. The <b>ReHo</b> values were negatively correlated with the UPDRS total scores in the right putamen in LOPD, but a correlation between the <b>ReHo</b> value and UPDRS score was not detected in EOPD. Conclusions: Our findings support the notion that age at onset is associated with the distribution of cerebral regional homogeneity in the resting state and suggest that disproportionate putamen alterations are more prominent in patients with a younger age of onset...|$|E
40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about how {{spontaneous}} brain activity progresses from non-hepatic encephalopathy (non-HE) to minimal HE (MHE). The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the evolution pattern of spontaneous brain activities in cirrhotic patients using resting-state fMRI with a regional homogeneity (<b>ReHo)</b> method. Methodology/Principal Findings: Resting-state fMRI data were acquired in 47 cirrhotic patients (minimal HE [MHE], n = 20, and non-HE, n = 27) and 25 age-and sex-matched healthy controls. The Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (KCC) was used to measure the regional homogeneity. The regional homogeneity maps were compared with ANOVA tests among MHE, non-HE, and healthy control groups and t-tests between each pair in a voxel-wise way.

40|$|While {{researchers}} have extensively characterized functional connectivity between brain regions, {{the characterization of}} functional homogeneity within a region of the brain connectome is in early stages of development. Several functional homogeneity measures were proposed previously, among which regional homogeneity (<b>ReHo)</b> was most widely used as a measure to characterize functional homogeneity of resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) signals within a small region (Zang et al., 2004). Despite a burgeoning literature on <b>ReHo</b> {{in the field of}} neuroimaging brain disorders, its test-retest (TRT) reliability remains unestablished. Using two sets of public R-fMRI TRT data, we systematically evaluated the ReHo's TRT reliability and further investigated the various factors influencing its reliability and found: 1) nuisance (head motion, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid) correction of R-fMRI time series can significantly improve the TRT reliability of <b>ReHo</b> while additional removal of global brain signal reduces its reliability, 2) spatial smoothing of R-fMRI time series artificially enhances <b>ReHo</b> intensity and influences its reliability, 3) surface-based R-fMRI computation largely improves the TRT reliability of <b>ReHo,</b> 4) a scan duration of 5 min can achieve reliable estimates of <b>ReHo,</b> and 5) fast sampling rates of R-fMRI dramatically increase the reliability of <b>ReHo.</b> Inspired by these findings and seeking a highly reliable approach to exploratory analysis of the human functional connectome, we established an R-fMRI pipeline to conduct <b>ReHo</b> computations in both 3 -dimensions (volume) and 2 -dimensions (surface).

To characterize brain dysfunction in TRD, we performed resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) on 22 TRD patients, along with 26 matched healthy subjects and 22 patients who were depressed but not treatment-refractory (NDD) as comparison groups. Results were analyzed using a data-driven approach known as Regional Homogeneity (<b>ReHo)</b> analysis which measures the synchronization of spontaneous fMRI signal oscillations within spatially neighboring voxels. Relative to healthy controls, both depressed groups showed high <b>ReHo</b> primarily within temporo-limbic structures, and more widespread low <b>ReHo</b> in frontal, parietal, posterior fusiform cortices, and caudate.

We aimed to clarify the regional alterations in ALFF, fALFF, and <b>ReHo</b> in schizophrenia using a meta-analysis and a large-sample validation. A meta-analysis of activation likelihood estimation was conducted based on the abnormal foci of ten studies. A large sample of 86 schizophrenia patients and 89 healthy controls was compared to verify the results of the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis demonstrated that the alternations in ALFF and <b>ReHo</b> had similar distribution in schizophrenia patients. The foci with decreased ALFF/fALFF and <b>ReHo</b> in schizophrenia were mainly located in the somatosensory cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and occipital cortex; however, foci with increased ALFF/fALFF and <b>ReHo</b> were mainly located in the bilateral striatum, medial temporal cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex. The large-sample study showed consistent findings with the meta-analysis. These findings may expound the pathophysiological hypothesis and guide future research...|$|E
40|$|Resting-state {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (RS-fMRI) has been widely used to investigate temporally correlated fluctuations between distributed brain areas, as well as to characterize local synchronization of low frequency (, 0. 1 Hz) spontaneous fMRI signal. Regional homogeneity (<b>ReHo)</b> was proposed as a voxel-wise measure of the synchronization of the timecourses of neighboring voxels and has been used in many studies of brain disorders. However, the interpretation of <b>ReHo</b> remains challenging because the effect of high frequency task on <b>ReHo</b> is still not clear. In order to investigate the effect of a high-frequency task on the modulation of local synchronization of resting-state activity, we employed three right-finger movement scanning sessions: slow-event related (‘Slow’), fast-event related (‘Fast’), and continuous finger pressure (‘Tonic’), from 21 healthy participants and compared the <b>ReHo</b> of the three task states with that of resting-state (‘Rest’). In the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, ‘Slow ’ task state showed greater <b>ReHo</b> than ‘Rest ’ in low frequency band (0 – 0. 08 Hz) fMRI signal, but lower <b>ReHo</b> in high frequency band (0. 08 – 1. 67 Hz); ‘Fast ’ task state showed lower <b>ReHo</b> than ‘Rest ’ in both the low and high frequency band; ‘Tonic ’ state did not show any significant difference compared to ‘Rest’. The results in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex suggest that local synchronization of BOLD signal varies with different finger tapping speed. In the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex, all the three task states had lower <b>ReHo</b> than the ‘Rest ’ state both in the low and high frequency, suggesting a similar effect of fast and slow finger tapping frequencies on local synchronization of BOL...|$|E

Design: The <b>ReHo</b> method and Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 software were used to evaluate whether resting-state localized brain activity was modulated between PCPIs and good sleepers (GSs), and correlation analysis between altered regional brain areas and clinical features was calculated. Patients and participants: Twenty-four PCPIs (17 females, seven males) and 24 (12 females, 12 males) age-, sex-, and education-matched GSs. Measurements and results: PCPIs disturbed subjective sleep quality, split positive mood, and exacerbated negative moods. Compared with GSs, PCPIs showed higher <b>ReHo</b> in left fusiform gyrus, and lower <b>ReHo</b> in bilateral cingulate gyrus and right cerebellum anterior lobe. Compared with female GSs, female PCPIs showed higher <b>ReHo</b> in the left fusiform gyrus and right posterior cingulate, and lower <b>ReHo</b> in the left cerebellum anterior lobe and left superior frontal gyrus. Compared with male GSs, male PCPIs showed higher <b>ReHo</b> in the right temporal lobe and lower <b>ReHo</b> in the bilateral frontal lobe. The fusiform gyrus showed strong positive correlations and the frontal lobe showed negative correlations with the clinical measurements. Conclusion: The <b>ReHo</b> analysis is a useful noninvasive imaging tool {{for the detection of}} cerebral changes and the indexing of clinical features. The abnormal spontaneous activity areas provided important information on the neural mechanisms underlying emotion and sleep-quality impairment in PCPIs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To prospectively {{investigate}} and detect early cerebral regional homogeneity (<b>ReHo)</b> changes in neurologically asymptomatic patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) using in vivo resting-state functional MR imaging (Rs-fMRI). METHODS: We enrolled 20 patients (15 men, 5 women; meanage, 37. 1 years; range, 19 - 49 years) with ESRD and 20 healthy controls (15 men, 5 women; mean age, 38. 3 years; range, 28 - 49 years). The mean duration of hemodialysis {{for the patient}} group was 10. 7 ± 6. 4 monthes. There was no significant sex or age difference between the ESRD and control groups. Rs-fMRI was performed using a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence. <b>ReHo</b> was calculated using software (DPARSF). Voxel-based analysis of the <b>ReHo</b> maps between ESRD and control groups was performed with a two-samples t test. Statistical maps were set at P value less than 0. 05 and were corrected for multiple comparisons. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered to all participants at imaging. RESULTS: <b>ReHo</b> values were increased in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus and left medial frontal gyrus in the ERSD group compared with controls, but a significantly decreased <b>ReHo</b> value {{was found in the}} right middle temporal gyrus. There was no significant correlation between <b>ReHo</b> values and the duration of hemodialysis in the ESRD group. Both the patients and control subjects had normal MMSE scores (≥ 28). CONCLUSIONS: Our finding revealed that abnormal brain activity was distributed mainly in the memory and cognition related cotices in patients with ESRD. The abnormal spontaneous neuronal activity in those areas provide information on the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in patients with ESRD, and demonstrate that Rs-fMRI with <b>ReHo</b> analysis is a useful non-invasive imaging tool for the detection of early cerebral <b>ReHo</b> changes in hemodialysis patients with ESRD...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{demonstrated}} that primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) {{is associated with}} abnormal brain structure; however, {{little is known about}} the changes in the local synchronization of spontaneous activity. The main objective of this study was to investigate spontaneous brain activity in patients with POAG using regional homogeneity (<b>ReHo)</b> analysis based on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Thirty-nine POAG patients and forty-one age- and gender- matched healthy controls were finally included in the study. <b>ReHo</b> values were used to evaluate spontaneous brain activity and whole brain voxel-wise analysis of <b>ReHo</b> was carried out to detect differences by region in spontaneous brain activity between groups. Compared to controls, POAG patients showed increased <b>ReHo</b> in the right dorsal anterior cingulated cortex, the bilateral medial frontal gyrus and the right cerebellar anterior lobe, and decreased <b>ReHo</b> in the bilateral calcarine, bilateral precuneus gryus, bilateral pre/postcentral gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule and left cerebellum posterior lobe. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore the relationships between clinical measures and <b>ReHo</b> by region showed significant group differences in the POAG group. Negative correlations were found between age and the <b>ReHo</b> values of the superior frontal gyrus (r = - 0. 323, p =  0. 045), left calcarine (r = - 0. 357, p =  0. 026) and inferior parietal lobule (r = - 0. 362, p =  0. 024). A negative correlation was found between the <b>ReHo</b> values of the left precuneus and the cumulative mean defect (r = - 0. 400, p =  0. 012). POAG was associated with abnormal brain spontaneous activity in some brain regions and such changed regional activity may be associated with clinical parameters. Spontaneous brain activity may play a role in POAG initiation and progression...|$|E
40|$|Persistent somatoform pain {{disorder}} (PSPD) is {{a mental}} disorder un-associated with any somatic injury {{and can cause}} severe somatosensory and emotional impairments in patients. However, so far, the neuro-pathophysiological mechanism of the functional impairments in PSPD is still unclear. The present study assesses the difference in regional spontaneous activity between PSPD and healthy controls (HC) during a resting state, in order to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying PSPD. Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data were obtained from 13 PSPD patients and 23 age- and gender-matched HC subjects in this study. Kendall's coefficient of concordance {{was used to measure}} regional homogeneity (<b>ReHo),</b> and a two-sample t-test was subsequently performed to investigate the <b>ReHo</b> difference between PSPD and HC. Additionally, the correlations between the mean <b>ReHo</b> of each survived area and the clinical assessments were further analyzed. Compared with the HC group, patients with PSPD exhibited decreased <b>ReHo</b> in the bilateral primary somatosensory cortex, posterior cerebellum, and occipital lobe, while increased <b>ReHo</b> in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and default mode network (including the medial PFC, right inferior parietal lobe (IPL), and left supramarginal gyrus). In addition, significant positive correlations were found between the mean <b>ReHo</b> of both right IPL and left supramarginal gyrus and participants' Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) scores, and between the mean <b>ReHo</b> of the left middle frontal gyrus and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores. Our results suggest that abnormal spontaneous brain activity in specific brain regions during a resting state may be associated with the dysfunctions in pain, memory and emotional processing commonly observed in patients with PSPD. These findings help us to understand the neural mechanisms underlying PSPD and suggest that the <b>ReHo</b> metric {{could be used as a}} clinical marker for PSPD...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the different responses to acupuncture in MCI patients and age-matched healthy subjects {{reflected by the}} Regional Homogeneity (<b>ReHo)</b> indices. The experiment was performed at the acupoint KI 3 in 12 MCI patients and 12 healthy controls, respectively. A novel non-repeated event-related (NRER) fMRI design paradigm was applied to separately detect neural activities related to different stages of acupuncture (pre-acupuncture resting state, needling manipulation and post-acupuncture resting state). <b>ReHo</b> values were calculated for MCI patients and healthy controls in pre- and post-acupuncture resting state. Then, a two-way ANCOVA with repeated measures with post-hoc two sample t-tests was performed to explore the different responses to acupuncture in the two groups. The ANCOVA revealed {{a significant main effect}} of group, but no significant main effect of acupuncture and interactions between group and acupuncture. During the pre-acupuncture resting state, <b>ReHo</b> values increased in the precentral gyrus (PCG), superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and insula (INS) and decreased mainly in middle temporal gyrus (MTG), parahippocampal (PHIP) and cingulate cortex in MCI patients compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, we found that the regions including precuneus (PCUN), and cingulate cortex showed increased <b>ReHo</b> values for MCI patients following acupuncture. For healthy controls, the medial frontal gyrus, PCG, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and INS showed enhanced <b>ReHo</b> values following acupuncture. During the post-acupuncture resting state, MCI patients showed increased <b>ReHo</b> values mainly in the MTG, superior parietal lobule (SPL), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), supramarginal (SMG), and PCG, and decreased <b>ReHo</b> values mainly in the frontal regions, PHIP, and posterior cingulated cortex (PCC) compared to healthy controls. Though we found some <b>ReHo</b> changes between MCI patients and healthy controls, the two-way ANCOVA results showed no significant effects after multiple corrections.

40|$|Background To {{investigate}} {{the relationships among}} regional activity abnormalities, clinical disease se-verity, and prognosis in cirrhotic patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) using resting-state {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (rs-fMRI). Methods Regional homogeneity (<b>ReHo)</b> values of 12 cirrhotic patients with OHE and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were calculated from rs-fMRI. Two-sample t-test was per-formed on individual <b>ReHo</b> maps between the two groups. The relationships between <b>ReHo</b> variation, disease severity, and prognosis were analyzed. Results Cirrhotic patients with OHE had significantly low <b>ReHo</b> values in the left middle cingulum, bi-lateral superior temporal, left inferior orbito-frontal, right calcarine, left inferior frontal gyrus, left post-central, left inferior temporal, and left lingual areas, and high <b>ReHo</b> in the right su-perior frontal, right inferior temporal, right caudate, and cerebellum. There was significant group difference in the right superior temporal lobe (p= 0. 016) and crus 1 of the left cerebel-lum (p= 0. 015) between survivors and non-survivors in the OHE group.

40|$|AIM: We {{sought to}} use a {{regional}} homogeneity (<b>ReHo)</b> approach as an index in resting-state {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to investigate the features of spontaneous brain activity within the default mode network (DMN) in patients suffering from bipolar depression (BD). METHODS: Twenty-six patients with BD and 26 gender-, age-, and education-matched healthy subjects participated in the resting-state fMRI scans. We compared the differences in <b>ReHo</b> between the two groups within the DMN and investigated the relationships between sex, age, years of education, disease duration, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) total score, and <b>ReHo</b> in regions with significant group differences. RESULTS: Our results revealed that bipolar depressed patients had increased <b>ReHo</b> in the left medial frontal gyrus and left inferior parietal lobe compared to healthy controls. No correlations were found between regional <b>ReHo</b> values and sex, age, and clinical features within the BD group.
