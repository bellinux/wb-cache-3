50|$|A {{revocation}} may be express, {{by virtue}} of a clause known as a <b>revocatory</b> <b>clause,</b> or implied from the fact of provisions in the later will being inconsistent {{with those in the}} former. When certain dispositions in the two wills are inconsistent with each other, those in the earlier will are revoked. It follows that, if the two wills are entirely inconsistent, the earlier will is completely revoked. Where, however, it is possible to reconcile the provisions in both wills, such reconciliation should be made. A revocation is effected the moment the revoking will is duly executed.|$|E
