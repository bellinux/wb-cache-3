40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} the <b>reversibility</b> <b>of</b> airflow limitation, the concentration of nitric oxide (NO) in exhaled air, and the inflammatory cells in the sputum of patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We examined nine normal healthy control subjects and 20 nonatopic patients with COPD. Ten patients had no <b>reversibility</b> <b>of</b> airflow limitation (increase in FEV 1 of 200 ml after 200 µg of inhaled salbutamol). Exhaled NO levels were higher in COPD patients with partial <b>reversibility</b> <b>of</b> airflow limitation than in those with no <b>reversibility</b> <b>of</b> airflow limitation (median 24 [interquartile range 15. 3 to 32] ppb versus 8. 9 [4. 6 to 14. 7] ppb; p < 0. 01). Compared with healthy control subjects, only COPD patients with partial <b>reversibility</b> <b>of</b> airflow limitation had increased concentrations of sputum eosinophils. We conclude that, in patients with stable COPD, even a partial bronchodilator response to inhaled salbutamol is associated with increased exhaled NO and sputum eosinophilia, suggesting that these patients may have a different response to treatment than do those without reversible airflow limitation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{deals with}} <b>reversibility</b> <b>of</b> autoregressive {{processes}} of first order, namely AR(1). <b>Reversibility</b> <b>of</b> Markov chains with general state space was studied by Ōsawa (1985). His results {{are applied to}} AR(1) processes in this paper. Consider a Markov chain with transition densities whose state space is a Euclidian space. For <b>reversibility</b> <b>of</b> a Markov chain two ideas are available. One is reversibility with respect to some density, and the other time-reversibility. A time-reversibility chain has a stationary distribution constructed by the reversible density. On the other hand a reversible chain does not necessarily have one. We first state general theorems which provide criteria for determining whether a Markov chain is reversible with respect to some density, time-reversible or not. These are applied to AR(1) processes on the real line. We shall find some examples of Markov chains which have a reversible density but cannot be time-reversible. Further, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition under which a certain multivariate AR(1) process is reversible...|$|R
40|$|While {{one-dimensional}} cellular automata {{have been}} well studied, there are relatively few results about multidimensional cellular automata; the investigation of cellular automata defined on Cayley trees constitutes an intermediate class. This paper studies the <b>reversibility</b> <b>of</b> linear cellular automata defined on Cayley trees with periodic boundary condition, where the local rule is given by f(x_ 0, x_ 1, [...] ., x_d) = b x_ 0 + c_ 1 x_ 1 + [...] . + c_d x_d m for some integers m, d ≥ 2. The reversibility problem relates to solving a polynomial derived from a recurrence relation, and an explicit formula is revealed; as an example, the complete criteria <b>of</b> the <b>reversibility</b> <b>of</b> linear cellular automata defined on Cayley trees over Z_ 2, Z_ 3, and some other specific case are addressed. Further, this study achieves a possible approach for determining the <b>reversibility</b> <b>of</b> multidimensional cellular automata, which {{is known as a}} undecidable problem...|$|R

This work proposes a criterion for testing the <b>reversibility</b> <b>of</b> a multidimensional linear cellular automaton under null boundary condition and an algorithm for the computation of its reverse, if it exists. The investigation of the dynamical behavior of a multidimensional linear cellular automaton under null boundary condition is equivalent to elucidating the properties of block Toeplitz matrix. The proposed criterion significantly reduce the computational cost whenever the number of cells or the dimension is large; the discussion can also apply to cellular automata under periodic boundary condition with a minor modification...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Before {{the advent}} of {{antituberculous}} chemotherapy, thoracoplasty (TPL) was the definitive form of therapy for cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis. This study aimed to characterize the late functional sequelae of TPL, and to establish the degree <b>of</b> <b>reversibility</b> <b>of</b> any consequent airway obstruction. METHODOLOGY: Pulmonary function was studied in 21 long-term (mean 35 years) survivors of TPL between the years 1990 - 2001. RESULTS: A mixed obstructive/restrictive defect was found in this patient cohort. After inhalation of bronchodilator, marginal increases in FEV(1) and FVC and marginal decreases in FRC, RV and TLC were observed. Maximum mid-expiratory flow rate was severely reduced (28. 8 % <b>of</b> predicted), but <b>reversibility</b> after inhaled beta(2) -agonist was highest for this parameter of pulmonary function (mean 11 %). Smokers had a higher RV (P = 0. 04), suggesting hyperinflation, while non-smokers had a larger increase in FEV(1) /FVC ratio postbronchodilator (P = 0. 004), suggesting more marked <b>reversibility</b> <b>of</b> airways obstruction in this group. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survivors of TPL have an obstructive {{as well as a}} restrictive ventilatory defect. These patients have partial <b>reversibility</b> <b>of</b> the obstructive defect. The degree <b>of</b> <b>reversibility</b> found suggests that bronchodilator therapy may help these patients...|$|R
