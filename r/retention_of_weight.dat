40|$|Abstract Background Pregnancy and {{childbirth}} {{are associated}} with weight gain in women, and <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> gained during pregnancy can lead to obesity in later life. Diet and physical activity are factors that can influence the loss of retained pregnancy weight after birth. Exercise guidelines exist for pregnancy, but recommendations for exercise after childbirth are virtually nonexistent. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of physical activity intervention based on pedometer on physical activity level and anthropometric measures of women after childbirth. Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial in which 66 women who had given birth 6 weeks to 6 months prior were randomly assigned to receive either a 12 week tailored program encouraging increased walking using a pedometer (intervention group, n = 32) or routine postpartum care (control group, n = 34). During the 12 -week study period, each woman in the intervention group wore a pedometer and recorded her daily step count. The women were advised to increase their steps by 500 per week until they achieved the first target of 5000 steps per day and then continued to increase it to minimum of 10, 000 steps per day by the end of 12 th week. Assessed outcomes included anthropometric measures, physical activity level, and energy expenditure per week. Data were analyzed using the paired t-test, independent t-test, Mann-Whitney, chi-square, Wilcoxon, covariance analysis, and the general linear model repeated measures procedure as appropriate. Results After 12 weeks, women in the intervention group had significantly increased their physical activity and energy expenditure per week (4394 vs. 1651 calorie, p P = 0. 001), Body Mass Index (P = 0. 001), waist circumference (P = 0. 001), hip circumference (P = 0. 032) and waist-hip ratio (P = 0. 02) were presented after the intervention.

40|$|Obesity {{and being}} {{overweight}} affect {{almost half of}} all women of childbearing age, with postpartum weight retention (PWR) being a key contributing factor. <b>Retention</b> <b>of</b> postpartum <b>weight</b> has a number of negative health implications for mothers and offspring, including longer-term higher body mass index (BMI). There is increasing evidence that psychological factors are associated with PWR, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, and body dissatisfaction.

40|$|Women {{naturally}} {{gain weight}} during pregnancy and many gradually lose it afterwards. Some women, though, {{find it difficult}} to lose the gained weight in the year or two following the birth of the baby and there is concern that this may be a health risk for them. The <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> gained during pregnancy may contribute to obesity, which can increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. It is suggested that women who return to their pre-pregnancy weight by about six months have a lower risk of being overweight 10 years later. The review looked for randomised studies {{to assess the impact of}} dieting or exercise, or both, on women's weight loss in the months after giving birth. It paid particular attention to breastfeeding women to be sure that breastfeeding was not compromised. The review of trials found 14 studies, with 12 studies involving 910 women carrying excess weight after childbirth that contributed data for analysis. The findings suggest that diet combined with exercise or diet alone compared with usual care seemed to help with weight loss after giving birth. There is potential for these interventions to play a role in preventing future maternal obesity. There was not sufficient evidence to be sure that exercise or diet did not interfere with breastfeeding though it appeared not to in the included studies. It seems preferable to lose weight through a combination of dieting and exercise, compared to dieting alone, because exercise is thought to improve circulation and heart fitness, and to preserve lean body mass.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} three behaviorally based weight loss treatments on long term (6 month) weight maintenance following an 8 week intervention. The main focus {{of this study was}} to evaluate the impact of psychosocial factors (self-efficacy and social support) on the maintenance of weight loss in obese adults following a randomized weight loss trial. Currently, there is a need for more psychological theory-based weight loss interventions to identify the most effective methods for sustained behavior change. Self-efficacy has been identified as a key component of successful weight loss. Social support has been shown in the literature to have a positive impact on weight loss, but the relationship between social support and weight loss maintenance is unclear. Methods: This study was a 6 month follow-up (4 months post-intervention) to an 8 week weight loss intervention. Participants (n = 109) were recruited in two cohorts (Fall and Spring) and randomized into one of three treatments: 1) guided weight loss support, 2) self-monitoring tool, or 3) guided support and self-monitoring tool. Of the 78 participants that completed the 8 week intervention, 53 returned for the 6 month follow-up. Anthropometric measures (height, weight, BMI, body fat, waist circumference) and responses to self-efficacy surveys (diet and physical activity) were collected at baseline, 8 weeks, and 6 months. Participants also completed surveys evaluating perceived social support from family and friends for health behaviors (eating habits and physical activity) at 6 months.

Results Being overweight or obese prepregnancy was strongly associated with socioeconomic status and adverse behavioural factors. Obese women (18 % of the cohort) {{were more likely to}} experience gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, and their children were more likely to experience intensive- or special-care nursery admission, fetal distress, resuscitation, and macrosomia. Women were more likely to retain weight postpartum if they consumed three or fewer serves of fruit/vegetables per day, did not engage in recreational activity with their baby, spent less than once a week on walking for 30 minutes or more or spent time with friends less than once per week. Mothers who breastfed for more than 3 months had reduced likelihood of high postpartum weight retention.

40|$|Background Approximately 1 in 5 {{pregnant}} {{women in the}} United Kingdom are obese. In addition to being associated generally with poor health, obesity {{is known to be}} a contributing factor to pregnancy and birth complications and the <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> gestational <b>weight</b> can lead to long term obesity. This paper describes the protocol for a cluster randomised trial to evaluate whether a weight management intervention for obese {{pregnant women}} is effective in reducing women’s Body Mass Index at 12 months following birth. Methods/design The study is a cluster randomised controlled trial involving 20 maternity units across England and Wales. The units will be randomised, 10 to the intervention group and 10 to the control group. 570 pregnant women aged 18 years or over, with a Body Mass Index of +/= 30 (kg/m 2) and between 12 and 20 weeks gestation will be recruited. Women allocated to the control group will receive usual care and two leaflets giving advice on diet and physical activity. In addition to their usual care and the leaflets, women allocated to the intervention group will be offered to attend a weekly 1. 5 hour weight management group, which combines expertise from Slimming World with clinical advice and supervision from National Health Service midwives, until 6 weeks postpartum. Participants will be followed up at 36 weeks gestation and at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months postpartum. Body Mass Index at 12 months postpartum is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include pregnancy <b>weight</b> gain, quality <b>of</b> life, mental health, waist-hip ratio, child weight centile, admission to neonatal unit, diet, physical activity levels, pregnancy and birth complications, social support, self-regulation and self-efficacy. A cost effectiveness analysis and process evaluation will also be conducted. Discussion This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a theory-based intervention developed for obese pregnant women. If successful the intervention will equip women with the necessary knowledge and skills to enable them to make healthier choices for themselves and their unborn child.

50|$|A space toilet, or {{zero gravity}} toilet, is a toilet {{that can be}} used in a weightless environment. In the absence <b>of</b> <b>weight,</b> the {{collection}} and <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> liquid and solid waste is directed by use of air flow. Since the air used to direct the waste is returned to the cabin, it is filtered beforehand to control odor and cleanse bacteria. In older systems, waste water is vented into space, and any solids are compressed and stored for removal upon landing. More modern systems expose solid waste to vacuum pressures to kill bacteria, which prevents odor problems and kills pathogens.|$|R
30|$|Figure  2 {{shows the}} change in MOR {{retention}} over time. The MOR <b>retentions</b> <b>of</b> the two PBs decreased linearly at all exposure sites. The decrease in MOR <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> PB(PF) was higher than that <b>of</b> PB(MDI). MOR <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> PB(PF) was less than 40  % after 6  years of exposure at all sites except for Noshiro. On the other hand, MOR <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> PB(MDI) remained {{higher than that of}} PB(PF). The MDFs maintained comparatively high MOR retentions at all sites for 7  years. The MOR <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> OSB(aspen) in Shizuoka and Miyakonojo were less than 50  % after only 1  year and were only 10  % after 6  years of exposure. For OSB(aspen), there were two patterns of decreasing MOR retention: retention linearly decreased at sites in northern Japan and exponentially decreased at sites in southern Japan. The MOR <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> OSB(pine) tended to decrease linearly for all regions. The variation among PWs was large, and any characteristic tendencies were unclear.|$|R
