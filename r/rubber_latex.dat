Renewable fuels from plants include firewood, peat and other biofuels. The fossil fuels coal, petroleum and natural gas are derived from the remains of aquatic organisms including phytoplankton in geological time.|$|E

40|$|Background Natural <b>latex</b> <b>rubber</b> {{products}} {{have been known}} to cause severe anaphylactic reactions during surgery. Even 25 years after the first description of anaphylactic reactions in the literature, natural <b>latex</b> <b>rubber</b> products are still used in pediatric surgery. Case presentation The following article describes the case of a healthy 4. 5 -year old Caucasian boy who simultaneously developed severe hypotension, tachycardia and bronchospasm during surgery for congenital strabismus sursoadductorius under uneventful anesthesia. An allergy test conducted afterwards showed natural <b>latex</b> <b>rubber</b> as the trigger for this severe intraoperative anaphylactic reaction. This case was special because of the absence of any previous clinical or anamnestical evidence of natural <b>latex</b> <b>rubber</b> allergy. The fact that the child had been previously exposed to natural <b>latex</b> <b>rubber</b> – because the boy’s mother used disposable gloves for her work as a cosmetician at home – was only discovered later. Such contact may have had a slight sensitizing effect that manifested after the initial contact with the conjunctiva through the surgeon’s natural <b>latex</b> <b>rubber</b> gloves. Conclusion Natural <b>latex</b> <b>rubber</b> {{products have}} caused severe anaphylactic reactions time and again. Diagnosis is impeded by the highly variable clinical symptoms of anaphylaxis, the non-responsivity of patients, anesthesia-induced changes in blood pressure, surgical drapes, and blood loss. Therefore, use of alternative products and implementation of the right course of action in clinical routine seems to be even more important than raising awareness for allergies to natural <b>latex</b> <b>rubber...</b>|$|R

25|$|Natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> is {{shipped from}} {{factories}} in south-west Asia, South America, and West and Center Africa to destinations around the world. As {{the cost of}} natural rubber has risen significantly and rubber products are dense, the shipping methods offer the lowest cost per unit weight are preferred. Depending on destination, warehouse availability, and transportation conditions, some methods are preferred by certain buyers. In international trade, latex rubber is mostly shipped in 20-foot ocean containers. Inside the container, smaller containers are used to store the latex.|$|E
25|$|South America {{remained}} {{the main source}} of the limited amounts of latex rubber used during much of the 19th century. The trade was heavily protected and exporting seeds from Brazil was a capital offense, although no law prohibited it. Nevertheless, in 1876, Henry Wickham smuggled 70,000 Pará rubber tree seeds from Brazil and delivered them to Kew Gardens, England. Only 2,400 of these germinated. Seedlings were then sent to India, British Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), Singapore, and British Malaya. Malaya (now Peninsular Malaysia) was later to become the biggest producer of rubber. In the early 1900s, the Congo Free State in Africa was also a significant source of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex,</b> mostly gathered by forced labor. Liberia and Nigeria started production.|$|E
25|$|The dinosaurs {{were made}} by Delgado {{in the same fashion}} as Kong and based on Charles R. Knight's murals in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. All the {{armatures}} were manufactured in the RKO machine shop. Materials used were cotton, foam <b>rubber,</b> <b>latex</b> sheeting, and liquid latex. Football bladders were placed inside some models to simulate breathing. A scale of one-inch-equals-one-foot was employed and models ranged from 18 inches to 3 feet in length. Several of the models were originally built for Creation and sometimes two or three models were built of individual species. Prolonged exposure to studio lights wreaked havoc with the latex skin so John Cerasoli carved wooden duplicates of each model to be used as stand-ins for test shoots and lineups. He carved wooden models of Ann, Driscoll, and other human characters. Models of the Venture, railway cars, and war planes were built.|$|E

25|$|Seals at {{the wrists}} and neck prevent water {{entering}} the suit by a close contact fit against {{the skin around}} the wrists and neck. The seals are not absolutely watertight, however, and the wearer may experience some seepage during use. The wearer will also get damp due to sweat and condensation. The seals are typically made from latex rubber or foam neoprene, but are also available in silicone <b>rubber.</b> <b>Latex</b> seals are supple but easily damaged and deteriorate with exposure to oils, oxygen, and other materials, so they must be replaced periodically, every two years or more often. Latex also causes an allergic reaction in some users. Neoprene seals last longer and are non-allergenic, but, being less elastic, let more water enter {{because they do not}} seal as effectively as latex seals to the contours of wrist and neck. They are also typically glued and sewn together to form a tube, and may leak along that seam.|$|E
500|$|Two of {{the most}} complex special effects in the film were the corpses of Barrymore's and Walls' characters, Casey Becker and Steve Orth. Their deaths {{involved}} the character being gutted from ribcage to pelvis, essentially hollowing out the torso of internal organs, with the guts [...] "rolling" [...] from the wound. To allow Walls to continue to move and feign death while displaying the wound, KNB designed a chair with no back. The actor would kneel behind it while his upper body, head, and arms were positioned within the chair's seating area. An anatomical model representing the character's torso and legs was positioned in the chair and disguised so that the actor's upper body and the model appeared to be one piece. The fake abdomen was filled with <b>rubber,</b> <b>latex,</b> and gelatin pieces smeared in fake blood—the [...] "internal organs" [...] — which could then fall free. The other effect involved Barrymore's character being gutted and hung by the neck from a tree. The team utilized a similar approach, but replicated Barrymore's entire body, as {{it would be impossible to}} conceal her real body and display the special effect of her character having been gutted.|$|E
