50|$|The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} commercial EIT systems in ICUs will show whether the promising {{body of evidence}} obtained from animal models will apply to humans as well (EIT-guided lung recruitment, selection of optimum PEEP levels, pneumothorax detection, prevention of ventilator associated lung injury (VALI), etc.). This would be highly desirable, given that recent studies suggest that 15% of mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU will develop acute lung injury (ALI) with attendant progressive lung collapse and which {{is associated with a}} reportedly high mortality of 39%. Just recently, the first prospective animal trial on EIT-guided mechanical ventilation and outcome could demonstrate significant benefits in regard to <b>respiratory</b> <b>mechanics,</b> gas exchange, and histological signs of ventilator-associated lung injury.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE:: Selected optimal {{respiratory}} cycles {{should allow}} calculation of <b>respiratory</b> <b>mechanic</b> parameters focusing on patient-ventilator interaction. New computer software automatically selecting optimal breaths and <b>respiratory</b> <b>mechanic</b> derived from those cycles are evaluated. DESIGN:: Retrospective study. SETTING:: University level III {{neonatal intensive care}} unit. SUBJECTS:: Ten mins synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation and assist/control ventilation recordings from ten newborns. INTERVENTION:: The ventilator provided <b>respiratory</b> <b>mechanic</b> data (ventilator <b>respiratory</b> cycles) every 10 secs. Pressure, flow, and volume waves and pressure volume, pressure flow, and ventilator volume flow loops were reconstructed from continuous pressure/volume recordings. Visual assessment determined assisted leak-free optimal respiratory cycles (selected respiratory cycles). New software graded the quality of cycles (automated <b>respiratory</b> cycles). <b>Respiratory</b> <b>mechanic</b> values were derived from both sets of optimal cycles. We evaluated quality selection and compared mean values and their variability according to ventilatory mode and <b>respiratory</b> <b>mechanic</b> provenance. To assess discriminating power, all 45 "t" values obtained from interpatient comparisons were compared for each <b>respiratory</b> <b>mechanic</b> parameter. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: A total of 11, 724 breaths are evaluated. automated respiratory cycle/selected respiratory cycle selections agreement is high: 88 % of maximal kappa with linear weighting. Specificity and positive predictive values are 0. 98 and 0. 96, respectively. Averaged values are similar between automated respiratory cycle and ventilator respiratory cycle. C 20 /C alone is markedly decreased in automated respiratory cycle (1. 27 +/- 0. 37 vs. 1. 81 +/- 0. 67). Tidal volume apparent similarity disappears in assist/control: automated respiratory cycle tidal volume (4. 8 +/- 1. 0 mL/kg) is significantly lower than for ventilator respiratory cycle (5. 6 +/- 1. 8 mL/kg). Coefficients of variation decrease for all automated respiratory cycle parameters in all infants. "t" values from ventilator respiratory cycle data are {{two to three times}} higher than ventilator respiratory cycles. CONCLUSIONS:: Automated selection is highly specific. Automated respiratory cycle reflects most the interaction of both ventilator and patient. Improving discriminating power of ventilator monitoring will likely help in assessing disease status and following trends. Averaged parameters derived from automated respiratory cycles are more precise and could be displayed by ventilators to improve real-time fine tuning of ventilator settings. Peer reviewe...|$|R

5000|$|Type 1 {{and type}} 2 pneumocytes. Type 1 pneumocytes (or {{membranous}} pneumocytes) form {{the structure of}} the alveolus and are responsible for the gas exchange in the alveolus. Type 1 pneumocytes are squamous epithelial cells which are characterized by a superficial layer consisting of large, thin, scale-like cells; they also cover 95% of the alveolar surface, although they are only half as numerous as Type 2 pneumocytes. Type 2 pneumocytes are important in that they can proliferate and differentiate into type 1 pneumocytes, which cannot replicate and are susceptible to a vast numbers of toxic insults. Type 2 pneumocytes are also important because they secrete pulmonary surfactant(PS), which consists 80-90% of phospholipids phosphatidyglycerol(PG), phosphaditylinositol (PI) and 5-10% of surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, AND SP-D). PS is synthesized as lamellar bodies, which are structures consisting of closely packed bilayers that are secreted and then undergo transformation into a morphological form called tubular myelin. PS {{plays an important role in}} maintaining normal <b>respiratory</b> <b>mechanics</b> by reducing alveolar surface tension. By lowering alveolar surface tension, PS reduces the energy required to inflate the lungs, and reduces the likelihood of alveolar collapse during expiration. Loosely attached to these alveoli sacs are the alveolar macrophages that protect the lungs from a broad array of microbes and aerosols by devouring and ingesting them through phagocytosis.|$|E
30|$|Introduction Bench test {{studies are}} {{performed}} to evaluate or compare ventilators.

Consequently, bench studies use different <b>respiratory</b> <b>mechanics</b> variable which have a big impact on results [1].

40|$|ABSTRACT The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to associate the healthy area of the lung (evaluated by radiography) with the data of <b>respiratory</b> <b>mechanics</b> in children with atelectasis after cardiac surgery, under mechanical ventilation in the assisted controlled mode. Altogether, 46 children were selected, but 16 were excluded due to irregular respiratory waves or lack of the data on arterial blood gases. A group of 30 children under assisted controlled mode were analyzed, and 10 from this group developed atelectasis. The data were analyzed before and after the onset of atelectasis, and <b>respiratory</b> <b>mechanics</b> was correlated to radiography. We also analyzed the data related to arterial blood gas of these children - who initially had no pulmonary complication - to verify possible changes due to assisted controlled cycles. Atelectasis may modify some parameters of <b>respiratory</b> <b>mechanics.</b> In the association of the healthy area of the lung with the <b>respiratory</b> <b>mechanics,</b> the Spearman correlation results showed statistical significance of the lung area with airway resistance (&# 961;=&# 8722; 0. 648 and p= 0. 043). Our results show that it is possible to analyze <b>respiratory</b> <b>mechanics</b> waves by selecting controlled cycles in the assisted controlled mode, since we found insignificant changes in potential ionic hydrogen. The analysis of <b>respiratory</b> <b>mechanics</b> allows checking lung function and undesired lung injuries; the analysis of <b>respiratory</b> <b>mechanics</b> can be daily performed in these children to have important information on the pulmonary function.

30|$|Introduction: Simulation in {{intensive}} care is an innovative method for teaching. Respiratory settings are responsible for some morbi-mortality of our patients. For this reason we develop a simulator of artificial ventilation (SimVA) and virtual patients.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} alveolar recruitment based on mean airway pressure (MAP) on pig lungs submitted to thoracotomy through blood gas exchange and hemodynamic parameters. METHODS: Twelve pigs weighting approximately 25 Kg were intubated and ventilated on volume controlled ventilation (tidal volume 10 ml/Kg, respiratory rate 16 min, FiO 2 1. 0, inspiratory:expiratory ratio 1 : 2, PEEP 5 cmH 2 O). The animals were then randomized into two groups: control and left lateral thoracotomy. The PEEP was increased at each 15 -minute intervals to reach a MAP of 15, 20 and 25 cmH 2 O, respectively. Hemodynamic, gas exchange and <b>respiratory</b> <b>mechanic</b> data were measured immediately before each PEEP change. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences}} between both groups in all parameters analyzed (P= 1. 0). The PaO 2, PaCO 2, MAP, PAP and plateau pressure were significantly worse at MAP of 25 cmH 2 O, when compared with the other values of MAP (P= 0. 001, P= 0. 039, P= 0. 001, P= 0. 016 e P= 0. 027, respectively). The best pulmonary performance according to the analyzed parameters was observed at MAP of 20 cmH 2 O. CONCLUSION: PEEP adjusted to MAP of 20 cmH 2 O resulted in best arterial oxygenation, without compromising the venous return, as opposed to MAP of 25 cmH 2 O, which caused deterioration of gas exchange, hemodynamics and <b>respiratory</b> <b>mechanic...</b>|$|R
