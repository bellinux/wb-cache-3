50|$|A special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> {{obtained}} in an auction is not transferable, {{that is to}} say, the number can be used only on vehicles registered {{under the name of}} the buyer. Transferring a special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> from one vehicle to another is permitted provided that they are both owned by the same person. Sale or transfer of vehicles bearing a special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> to someone else would lose that special <b>registration</b> <b>mark.</b> If the buyer is assigned the special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> to a vehicle, and later dies, the special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> cannot be transferred together with the vehicle to his heirs. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} consider in whose name one should buy a special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> in an auction. The use of a limited liability company as the buyer gets around the non-transferrable restriction because of its perpetual succession and the ability to transfer the company shares.|$|R

40|$|The {{registration}} of an aircraft {{is a prerequisite}} for issuance of a U. S. certificate of airworthiness by the FAA. The procedures and requirements for aircraft registration, and the subsequent issuance of registration numbers, are contained in FAR Part 47. However, the process/method(s) for applying the requirements of Parts 45 & 47 to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has not been defined. This task resolved the application of 14 CFR Parts 45 and 47 to UAS. Key Findings: UAS are aircraft systems and as such the recommended approach to registration is to follow the same process for registration as manned aircraft. This will require manufacturers to comply with the requirements for 14 CFR 47, Aircraft Registration and 14 CFR 45, Identification and <b>Registration</b> <b>Marking.</b> In addition, only the UA should be identified with the N number registration markings. There should also be a documentation link showing the applicability of the control station and communication link to the UA. The documentation link can be {{in the form of a}} Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS) entry or a UAS logbook entry. The recommended process for the {{registration of}} UAS is similar to the manned aircraft process and is outlined in a 6 -step process in the paper...|$|E

40|$|At he {{beginning}} of my thesis some basic notions are explained {{and there is a}} brief survey and conditions of the creation of legislation regulating the discussed problems, i. e. emergency laws, laws regarding dangerous substances handling and Nuclear Act above all. In the second part I analyze the readiness of state and community bodies for non-military critical situations (emergency legislation, documents of emergency planning) and for the solution of extraordinary events, I emphasize the task and activities of the integrated emergency system. In the following text I focus in detail on the legislation related to the way of securing and handling dangerous substances and radioactive substances. These are the following acts above all: Act on the Prevention of Serious Accidents (duties of operators handling dangerous substances, participation of public and its informing, state administration), Act on Chemical Substances and Chemical Agents (classification, testing and <b>registration,</b> <b>marking</b> and packaging of chemical substances and agents, transport of dangerous substances), Act on Waste and problems of nuclear energy and ionizing radiation are regulated by the Nuclear Act (nuclear safety and readiness for accidents, measures in the zone of emergency planning). This legislation is completed and detailed by some orders and regulations. The practical part is focused mainly on realizing the level of public knowledge and public awareness, mostly in the surroundings of institutions handling dangerous substances, about the risks connected with the operation of these institutions and about the suitable behaviour of inhabitants {{in case of an emergency}} connected with dangerous substances leakage. In the introduction of the practical part I state the characteristics of the survey as a whole, I define the basic file of respondents (from the point of view of identification marks), I describe methods used. In the next part I briefly state the examined regions from the point of view of the occurance of emergencies of dangerous substances leakage. I used the form of a questionnaire for handling this. The questionnaire was focused on questions about real knowledge (toxic effects of some substances, marking dangerous substances, emergency numbers knowledge, axioms of the behaviour of public in case of en emergency of dangerous substances leakage, nuclear problems). In an enclosure to the questionnaire I ask about the interest of the respondents in these problems and their preferences as for a suitable way to be informed about the risks connected with the operation of these institutions. The results of the survey are detailed in the chapter with this title. At the end of my thesis I state some recommended forms how to improve the know-how of public in emergency of dangerous substances leakage. The end of my thesis and the discussion focus on results summary and comparison of the results of my thesis with the results of other authors...|$|E
