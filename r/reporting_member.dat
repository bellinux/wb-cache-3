40|$|In this article, the {{intersection}} of gender, trafficking for sexual exploitation, and use of digital communication technologies are analyzed {{based on data from}} the European Union (EU). Over the past two decades, an increase in trafficking in human beings in the EU has been accompanied by an increase in the development and availability of digital communication technologies. The first statistical analysis of trafficking in human beings (2008 - 2010) carried out by the European Commission found 23, 632 victims of human trafficking in the <b>reporting</b> <b>member</b> states. Eighty percent of victims were women and girls; 20 % were men and boys. The majority of the victims (62 %) were trafficked for sexual exploitation. Digital communication technologies are widely used for trafficking for sexual exploitation, and more rarely for trafficking for forced labor. This article concludes that the combination of gender, trafficking for sexual exploitation, and use of digital communication technologies has created a nexus of victimization for women and girls. Based on this analysis and other sources of information, the European region is the world’s leading region for trafficking for sexual exploitation...|$|E

S. export promotion activities {{and to develop a}} governmentwide strategic plan. TPCC member agencies' activities include providing training, market information, advocacy, trade finance and other services to U. S. companies, especially small- and medium-sized businesses. These U. S. government agencies together have $ 1. 5 billion in budget authority for export promotion programs and activities for fiscal year 2006. Each year, the TPCC submits to Congress a mandated national export strategy, <b>reporting</b> <b>member</b> agencies' activities and trade promotion budget authority and establishing broad priorities. The TPCC secretariat, which has no budget of its own, is housed in the Commerce Department, which chairs the committee. In this testimony, which updates findings from a 2002 report, GAO (1) reports on trends in TPCC member agencies' budget authority; (2) assesses TPCC's coordination of trade promotion and its national export strategies; and (3) discusses small- and medium-sized businesses' participation in trade promotion activities. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} we propose a {{classification}} of river basin districts (RBDs) {{in terms of}} the consistency between reported significant pressures and pressures expected to be relevant in each RBD on the basis of pan-European indicators. We discuss the results and limitations of the classification obtained at European scale, and we suggest a perspective for its use for improving Water Framework Directive (WFD) implementation and the subsequent in-depth analysis of programmes of measures (PoMs) and their effectiveness. Overall, the analysis highlights that some river basin districts report pressures {{in a way that is}} in line with expectations from European indicators, while some others report either higher or lower pressure intensity than expected. Reasons for these discrepancies may include lack of relevant local information in the assessment of European indicators, and under/overestimation of pressures by the RBD authorities or <b>reporting</b> <b>member</b> states. The analysis presented here is based on data aggregated at RBD level, as allowed by the available information, and should be regarded mainly as a proof of concept. In the future, the same analysis should be updated with reference to individual water bodies, and taking into consideration the updates of river basin management plans and PoMs under development at the time of writing this report.
