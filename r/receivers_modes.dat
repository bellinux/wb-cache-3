The scattering by single and many scatterers was studied experimentally and numerically. The statistical properties of the scattered waves from many scatterers were examined and the corresponding results are presented. Ultrasonic transmission/reflection mode tomography was introduced. The theories of reflection mode computerised tomography were developed, by which reflectivity functions and scattering amplitude functions can be reconstructed. Image restoration and interpretation methods are presented. Computer simulation of ultrasonic measurements were carried out. A ultrasonic tomographic imaging system was developed, in which fan-shaped sound beam insonification was employed. Static physical models were used to simulate two-phase flows.

40|$|Multi-layer {{piezoelectric}} stack is a transducer stacked {{by numerous}} thin piezo layers which can convert an electrical energy into a mechanical energy in transmitter mode (actuators or vibrators) {{and can also}} convert a mechanical energy into an electrical energy in <b>receiver</b> <b>mode</b> (sensors and energy harvesters). Modelling vibrations of multi-layer piezoelectric stack {{plays a key role}} in design, fabrication and optimization of many multi-layer piezoelectric stack–based applications. In this article, a simplified transfer matrix of multi-layer piezoelectric stack, which considers the whole multi-layer piezoelectric stack to be an equivalent homogenous bulk, is proposed and formulated to model multi-layer piezoelectric stack–based vibration. When compared with a direct analytical method, the proposed transfer matrix greatly facilitates derivation of analytical solutions or direct calculations when multi-layer piezoelectric stack is stacked with other structures. Compared with using the transfer matrix proposed in the literature, which is subjected to individual piezo layer in multi-layer piezoelectric stack, the proposed simplified transfer matrix contributes to a much simpler form of analytical solution and greatly reduces the computational effort.

40|$|Since {{radio signals}} carry both energy and {{information}} at the same time, a unified study on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has recently drawn a significant attention for achieving wireless powered communication networks. In this paper, we study a multiple-input single-output (MISO) multicast SWIPT network with one multi-antenna transmitter sending common information to multiple single-antenna receivers simultaneously along with opportunistic wireless energy harvesting at each receiver. From the practical consideration, {{we assume that the}} channel state information (CSI) is only known at each respective receiver but is unavailable at the transmitter. We propose a novel <b>receiver</b> <b>mode</b> switching scheme for SWIPT based on a new application of the conventional random beamforming technique at the multi-antenna transmitter, which generates artificial channel fading to enable more efficient energy harvesting at each receiver when the received power exceeds a certain threshold. For the proposed scheme, we investigate the achievable information rate, harvested average power and/or power outage probability, as well as their various trade-offs in both AWGN and quasi-static fading channels. Compared to a reference scheme of periodic <b>receiver</b> <b>mode</b> switching without random transmit beamforming, the proposed scheme is shown to be able to achieve better rate-energy trade-offs when the harvested energy target is sufficiently large. Particularly, it is revealed that employing one single random beam for the proposed scheme is asymptotically optimal as the transmit power increases to infinity, and also performs the best with finite transmit power for the high harvested energy regime of most practical interests, thus leading to an appealing low-complexity implementation. Finally, we compare the rate-energy performances of the proposed scheme with different random beam designs. Comment: 36 pages, 17 figure...|$|R

The {{presence or absence of}} air inside the cavity has a marked effect upon the system parameters, such as the natural frequency, damping, and the pull-in voltage. The presence of vacuum inside the cavity of the device causes a reduction in the effective gap height which leads to a reduction in the pull-in voltage.

Navigation and positioning performance de-pends, among others, {{on the quality}} of the frequency generator. The first Hydrogen maser is in orbit with GIOVE-B. With further progress of clock technology a future GNSS system could be equipped with optical clocks, thereby making available a network of fre-quency standards of utmost stability in space. Today, epoch-wise synchronisation of satellite and re-ceiver clocks is an integral part of precise carrier phase positioning. As a consequence only relative positions are obtained with high accuracy and reference sites with well-known coordinates are needed to retrieve absolute position. Synchronised space clocks, on the other hand, allow for absolute precise positioning in single <b>receiver</b> <b>mode.</b> Similarly precise orbit determination will profit from the increased stability of the observation system. Simulations for the latter are presented in the paper. Optical clock technology can be divided into two main implementations.

The microsystem, used as emitter and receiver of ultrasonic signal, consists of a bulk micromachined suspended membrane. The membrane is thermally actuated at its resonance frequency (. 40 kHz) during emission. During reception, a piezoresistive bridge placed on the membrane is used for monitoring the membrane deflections. The resonance frequency of the membrane is tuned to the emitted frequency by keeping the membrane at the same temperature, achieving then maximum sensitivity.

In this paper, we investigate {{for the first time}} the JWIET in K-user MIMO IFC, in which receivers either decode the incoming information data (information decoding, ID) or harvest the RF energy (energy harvesting, EH). In the K-user IFC, we consider three different scenarios according to the <b>receiver</b> <b>mode</b> – i) multiple EH receivers and a single ID receiver, ii) multiple IDs and a single EH, and iii) multiple IDs and multiple EHs. For all scenarios, we have found a common necessary condition of the optimal transmission strategy and, accordingly, developed the transmission strategy that satisfies the common necessary condition, in which all the transmitters transferring energy exploit a rank-one energy beamforming. Furthermore, we have also proposed an iterative algorithm to optimize the covariance matrices of the transmitters that transfer information and the powers of the energy beamforming transmitters simultaneously, and identified the corresponding achievable rate-energy tradeoff region. Finally, we have shown that by selecting EH receivers according to their signal-to-leakage-and-harvested energy-ratio (SLER), we can improve the achievable rate-energy region further.
