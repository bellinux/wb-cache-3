25|$|The Silurian {{is a major}} {{division}} of the geologic timescale that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 Ma. During the Silurian, Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes, but {{there is evidence that}} the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation. The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in sea levels, recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an unconformity. Other cratons and continent fragments drifted together near the equator, starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as Euramerica. The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere. Other minor oceans include Proto-Tethys, Paleo-Tethys, <b>Rheic</b> <b>Ocean,</b> a seaway of Iapetus Ocean (now in between Avalonia and Laurentia), and newly formed Ural Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The Cesar-Ranchería Basin is {{underlain}} by Neoproterozoic basement. The Sierra Nevada Metamorphic Belt {{was formed}} during the Grenville orogeny, when the supercontinent Rodinia was formed {{due to the}} collision of Amazonia, Baltica and Laurentia. The granulites and gneisses of the complex have been dated to 1.5 to 1.0 Ga. The phyllites and quartzites of the Perijá Formation were formed during the Early Paleozoic and {{are related to the}} Caledonian orogeny. The shales of the Río Cachirí Group were deposited in the Devonian and contain abundant fossils of brachiopods, bryozoa, corals and crinoids. The formation is time-equivalent with the fossiliferous Floresta and Cuche Formations of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense. The sediments were deposited in an epicontinental sea {{at the edge of the}} Paleo-Tethys Ocean, the last remnant of the <b>Rheic</b> <b>Ocean.</b>|$|E
40|$|Subduction of {{both the}} Iapetus and <b>Rheic</b> <b>oceans</b> began {{relatively}} soon after their opening. Vestiges {{of both the}} Iapetan and Rheic oceanic lithospheres are preserved as supra-subduction ophiolites and related mafic complexes in the Appalachian–Caledonian and Variscan orogens. However, available Sm–Nd isotopic data indicate that the mantle source of these complexes was highly depleted {{as a result of}} an earlier history of magmatism that occurred prior to initiation of the Iapetus and <b>Rheic</b> <b>oceans.</b> We propose two alternative models for this feature: either the highly depleted mantle was preserved in a long-lived oceanic plateau within the Paleopacific realm or the source for the basalt crust was been recycled from a previously depleted mantle and was brought to an ocean spreading centre during return flow, without significant re-enrichment en-route. Data from present-day oceans suggest that such return flow was more likely to have occurred in the Paleopacific than in new mid-ocean ridges produced in the opening of the Iapetus and <b>Rheic</b> <b>oceans.</b> Variation in crustal density produced by Fe partitioning rendered the lithosphere derived from previously depleted mantle more buoyant than the surrounding asthenosphere, facilitating its preservation. The buoyant oceanic lithosphere was captured from the adjacent Paleopacific, in a manner analogous to the Mesozoic–Cenozoic “capture” in the Atlantic realm of the Caribbean plate. This mechanism of “plate capture” may explain the premature closing of the oceans, and the distribution of collisional events and peri-Gondwanan terranes in the Appalachian–Caledonian and Variscan orogens...|$|R
40|$|The eastern fl ank of the Appalachian orogen is {{composed}} of extensive Neoproterozoic–early Paleozoic crustal blocks that originated in a peri-Gondwanan setting. Three of these blocks record the evolution of Neoproterozoic magmatic-arc systems, including Carolinia in the southern Appalachians and Ganderia and Avalonia in the northern Appalachians. Relationships among these three crustal blocks are impor-tant for understanding both the accretionary history of the orogen {{and the evolution of}} the Iapetus and <b>Rheic</b> <b>Oceans,</b> fi rst-order geographic features of the Paleozoic globe. Traditionally, Carolinia and Avalonia have been considered to represent a single microcontinental magmatic arc that accreted to Laurentia in the middle to late Paleo-zoic. The early lithotectonic history (ca. 680 – 570 Ma) of the two blocks is obscure; however, their latest Neoproterozoic-Paleozoic histories are distinct. This disparity is manifest in the fi rst-order features of (1) timing and style of magmatic-arc cessation and (2) the nature of their Paleozoic lithotectonic records. Magmatic arc activity ceased in Avalonia in the late Neoproterozoic (ca. 570 Ma), succeeded by extension-related mag...|$|R
40|$|Before Wintsch’s {{study in}} 2010, the terrane {{boundary}} between the Westminster and Potomac terranes was accepted to be the Pleasant Grove thrust fault (see figure 2). Wintsch found that the white micas in the rocks of these two terranes differed in age by 60 Ma by using the closure temperatures of argon diffusion. Ages of the cleavages in rocks within the Westminster and Potomac terranes were determined using 40 Ar/ 39 Ar analysis of micas. In {{the western part of}} the Westminster terrane, cleavages are Early Silurian in age; and in the eastern part of the Westminster terrane and western Potomac terrane, cleavages are Late Devonian in age (Wintsch, 2010). From these cleavage domains, Wintsch proposed that the Parrs Ridge thrust fault is the terrane {{boundary between the}} Potomac and Westminster terranes.

40|$|Drilling of {{the distal}} Newfoundland margin at Ocean Drilling Program Site 1277 {{recovered}} {{part of the}} transition between exhumed sub-continental mantle lithosphere and normal mid-ocean-ridge basalt (N-MORB) volcanism perhaps related to the initiation of seafloor spreading, which may have occurred near the Aptian/Albian boundary, coincident with the final separation of subcontinental mantle lithosphere. Subcontinental mantle lithosphere was recovered near {{the crest of a}} basement high, the Mauzy Ridge. This ridge lies near magnetic Anomaly M 1 and is inferred to be of Barremian age. The recovered section is dominated by serpentinized spinel harzburgite, with subordinate dunite and minor gabbroic intrusives, and it includes inferred high-temperature ductile shear zones. The serpentinite is capped by foliated gabbro cataclasite that is interpreted as the product of a major seafloor extensional detachment. The serpentinized harzburgite beneath is highly depleted subcontinental mantle lithosphere that was exhumed to create new seafloor within the ocean-continent transition zone. After inferred removal of overlying brittle crust, the detachment was eroded, producing multiple mass flows that were dominated by clasts of serpentinite and gabbro in a lithoclastic and calcareous matrix. Basaltic lavas were erupted spasmodically, mainly as sheet flows, with subordinate lava breccia, hyaloclastite, and possible pillow lava. The sedimentary-volcanic succession and the exhumed mantle lithosphere experienced later high-angle extensional fracturing and probably faulting. Extensional fissures opened incrementally and were filled with silt-sized carbonate, basalt-derived clastic sediment, and hyaloclastite, forming neptunian dykes and geopetal structures. Chemical analysis of representative basalts for major elements and trace elements were made using a high-precision, high-accuracy X-ray fluorescence method (utilizing increased count times) and by whole-rock inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry that yielded additional evidence for rare earth elements. The analyses indicate N-MORB to slightly enriched compositions. The MORB was produced by relatively high degree melting of a fertile mantle source that differed strongly from the cored serpentinized peridotites. The basalts exhibit a distinct negative Nb anomaly on MORB-normalized plots that can be explained by prior extraction of melt from upper mantle that had previously been affected by subduction, possibly during closure of the Iapetus or <b>Rheic</b> <b>oceans.</b> In the proposed interpretation, mantle lithosphere was exhumed to the seafloor and experienced mass wasting to form serpentinite-rich mass flows. The interbedded MORB records the beginning of a transition to "normal" seafloor spreading. This interpretation takes into account drilling results from the Iberia-Galicia margin and the Jurassic Alps-Apennines...|$|R
2500|$|The Ordovician period {{started at}} a major {{extinction}} event called the Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma. [...] During the Ordovician the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana. Gondwana started the period in the equatorial latitudes and, as the period progressed, drifted toward the South Pole. Early in the Ordovician the continents Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica were still independent continents (since the break-up of the supercontinent Pannotia earlier), but Baltica began to move toward Laurentia later in the period, causing the Iapetus Ocean to shrink between them. Also, Avalonia broke free from Gondwana and began to head north toward Laurentia. The <b>Rheic</b> <b>Ocean</b> was formed {{as a result of}} this. By the end of the period, Gondwana had neared or approached the pole and was largely glaciated.|$|E
2500|$|The Devonian spanned roughly from 419 to 359 Ma. [...] The {{period was}} a time of great tectonic activity, as Laurasia and Gondwana drew closer together. The {{continent}} Euramerica (or Laurussia) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of Laurentia and Baltica, which rotated into the natural dry zone along the Tropic of Capricorn. In these near-deserts, the Old Red Sandstone sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidized iron (hematite) characteristic of drought conditions. Near the equator Pangaea began to consolidate from the plates containing North America and Europe, further raising the northern Appalachian Mountains and forming the Caledonian Mountains in Great Britain and Scandinavia. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent of Gondwana. The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere. Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas. The deep, enormous Panthalassa (the [...] "universal ocean") covered the rest of the planet.

40|$|New geochronological {{data from}} the Canigó massif (Eastern Pyrenees) using U–Pb SIMS on zircon provide {{evidence}} {{of the existence of}} a Late Ordovician (456 – 446 Ma) plutonic event that emplaced granitic and dioritic bodies into a Late Neoproterozoic–Early Paleozoic metasedimentary series. These are the first geochronological data documenting this magmatic episode in the Pyrenees, which is coeval with synsedimentary volcanism and normal fault development in rocks of the Upper Ordovician. This Late Ordovician magmatic event postdates a ?Middle Ordovician compressional episode recorded in the pre- Upper Ordovician sequence, and is distinct from an Early Ordovician magmatic event that gave rise to the protoliths of large gneissic bodies cropping out in the Pyrenees.

40|$|Abstract: A {{synthesis}} of the Late Palaeozoic to Cenozoic evolution of the Black Sea region and the southern parts of the East European Platform (EEP) is presented. During Carboniferous to Early Permian times the Cordillera-type Euxinus Orogen evolved along the southern margin of the EEP in response to progressive closure of the <b>Rheic</b> and Palaeotethys <b>oceans</b> and the accretion of Gondwana-derived continental terranes. Permian development of the north-dipping Palaeotethys subduction system along the southern Pontides margin of these terranes was accompanied by important compressional intraplate deformation on the EEP. Th e Mesozoic to Palaeogene evolution of the southern parts of the EEP, was goverened by closure of Palaeotethys, accretion of the Gondwana-derived Cimmerian terrane and gradual closure of the Neotethys, involving repeated opening and closure of back-arc basins. Five discrete tectonic subduction-related cycles are recognized, each commencing with back-arc extension and terminated with back-arc compression. Th e timing of these cycles is: (1) latest Permian to Hettangian, (2) Sinemurian to early Callovian, (3) late Callovian to Berriasian, (4) Valanginian to Paleocene and (5) Eocene to Recent. Th e duration of the individual cycles was {{of the order of}} 30 – 50 My. During back-arc extension, rift ed basins developed along the southern margin of the EEP whilst during back-arc compression compressional stresses were exerted on it, albeit at varying levels during the diff erent tectonic cycles. On the EEP, Late Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic intraplate tectonics are expressed by such phenomena as rift ing, extrusion of plateau basalts, inversion of pre-existing tensional basins, gentle lithospheric folding, regional uplift and subsidence...|$|R

50|$|All of the {{fragments}} {{that make up}} the Armorican terrane are thought to have originally formed part of the northern margin of Gondwana. Rifting initiated in the Cambrian to Ordovician although the terrane was still close enough to Gondwana to be affected by the Andean-Saharan glaciation during the late Ordovician. Complete separation from Gondwana, across the developing Paleotethys Ocean, is thought to have occurred {{towards the end of the}} Silurian. At this time Armorica was separated from Laurussia by the <b>Rheic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> One possible model includes Armorica as part of the Hun superterrane, while other show it moving separately. The <b>Rheic</b> <b>Ocean</b> closed during the Devonian and early Carboniferous, as the oceanic crust was subducted.
