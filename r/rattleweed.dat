50|$|Baptisia arachnifera, {{commonly}} known as hairy <b>rattleweed,</b> cobwebby wild indigo, hairy wild indigo, and hairy false indigo, is an endangered species of flowering plant in the legume family. Its native habitat is limited to sandy soils in pinewoods along the coastal plain of the U.S. state of Georgia.|$|E
5000|$|The name of {{the genus}} {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek word bapto, meaning [...] "to dip" [...] or [...] "immerse", while the {{specific}} name australis is Latin for [...] "southern". Additional common names of this plant exist, such as indigo weed, <b>rattleweed,</b> rattlebush and horsefly weed. The common name [...] "blue false indigo" [...] is derived from it being used as a substitute for the superior dye-producing plant Indigofera tinctoria.|$|E
50|$|Senna covesii (desert senna, Coues' senna, <b>rattleweed,</b> rattlebox, dais, or cove senna) is a {{perennial}} subshrub {{in the family}} Fabaceae, native to the Mojave Desert and Sonoran Desert in southeastern California, southern Nevada, and Arizona in the United States, and northern Baja California in Mexico. It is found on desert plains and in sandy washes between 500 and 600 m above sea level, and is very common in Joshua Tree National Park. The specific epithet honors ornithologist Elliott Coues.|$|E
50|$|The Aliso Canyon {{bottom is}} {{seasonal}} grassland, which flourishes {{in spring and}} diminishes by late summer or fall. The park protects habitat {{for a number of}} sensitive plant species, including many-stemmed dudleya, Pomona <b>rattleweed,</b> Orange County Turkish rugging, Palmer's grapplinghook, aphanisma, Laguna Beach dudleya, scrub oak, western dichondra, hummingbird sage, ocean spray, and crown-beard. Oak and sycamore are found in Wood Canyon, and marshes and grassy wetlands are found along Aliso Creek. Native grassland ecosystems in the less visited south-western portion of the park are considered largely intact.|$|E
50|$|Crotalaria retusa is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the legume family known by various common names including devil-bean, <b>rattleweed,</b> shack shack, and wedge-leaf rattlepod. It is poisonous to livestock, and contaminates human food. Its original native range is unclear, probably including tropical Asia, Africa and Australia. It has been introduced as a crop plant in many tropical areas and has escaped from cultivation to become a troublesome weed; it is listed as a noxious weed in several US states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and is listed as an invasive weed in India, Cuba, and Cocos Island. Unlike some other species of Crotalaria, it is an annual plant.|$|E
5000|$|Pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis {{is caused}} by the {{consumption}} of {{one or more of the}} 200 known plant species containing the toxic pyrrolizine alkaloids found all over the world today. [...] Established as the most common source of this illness are plants such as ragwort (Senecio jacobaea), woolly groundsels (Senecio redellii, Senecio longilobus), <b>rattleweed</b> (Crotalaria retusa), and seeds of yellow tarweed (Amsinckia intermedia). There are 30 known pyrrolizidine alkaloids that are hepatotoxic, meaning they cause injury to the liver. [...] Although animals innately know to give these toxic plants a wide berth while grazing, in extreme drought conditions animals have been known to ingest them as a source of minimal protein. Animals can also be poisoned if the toxic plant material is in pellets, or harvested with grain.|$|E
40|$|Baptisia arachnifera (Hairy <b>Rattleweed)</b> is an {{endangered}} herbaceous legume that only occurs in Wayne and Brantley Counties of Georgia, United States. Many {{of the remaining}} populations exist in areas now managed for timber. This study investigated the effects of Imazapyr, an herbicide commonly used in timber management, on growth and survivorship of B. arachnifera under both field and greenhouse conditions. This study also analyzed leaf and soil samples from six populations of B. arachnifera to determine the nutrient content of the leaves and soil. A recensus of a B. arachnifera population was also conducted in a site without commercial timber management. In the greenhouse, all B. arachnifera that were treated with herbicide died, regardless of herbicide application level within ten weeks. Control treatments survived and grew throughout the study. Field results showed that plants treated with low {{and high levels of}} herbicide died 2 - 4 weeks before the control plants, which also died due to heat stress. The concentrations of micronutrients (Al, B, Cu, Fe, Mn, Na and Zn) in leaf tissue differed across sites. Calcium concentration in the soil was found to be higher in where B...|$|E
