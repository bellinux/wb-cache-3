5|$|At the Simpsons' home, Bart and Ralph {{discover}} that the penitentiary will once again {{be used by the}} town, and <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> forgot to disable the power. Unaware that the power is active, Mayor Quimby straps himself into the electric chair in a publicity attempt. Ralph then tells Bart that Lisa can probably {{figure out a way to}} warn the Mayor. She decides to launch a model rocket with a warning message attached and aims it toward the penitentiary. However, the rocket is blown off-course and crashes through Mr. Burns' office window. Mr. Burns reads the note and disables the penitentiary's power. In the aftermath, the Simpsons congratulate Ralph, for pointing out that Lisa could solve the problem.|$|E
25|$|As {{far back}} as the 1960s, the footballing rivalry between England and Germany has been {{considered}} mainly an English phenomenon; this has been observed by several commentators of both English and German origin. In June 2009, British comedian Stephen Fry stated on the BBC show QI that, unlike the English, German football fans do not care about their team's loss at the 1966 World Cup final and may not even <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had made it that far. Instead, German fans consider their rivalry with the Netherlands to be their traditional footballing rivalry and care more about the matches against them, such as the 1974 FIFA World Cup final.|$|E
25|$|At the North Pole, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} attempt to save their fellow base personnel, who have been taken over by crab-like creatures. Their effort is interrupted as the Doctor and Clara arrive on the scene. While introductions are being made, however, they come under attack from the crabs, only to be rescued by Santa, who also provides a specimen of one of the creatures. The Doctor identifies the creatures as Dream Crabs – aliens that induce pleasant, euphoric dreams on their intended victims as a distraction whilst the crabs devour their brains. During this time, both the Doctor and Clara reveal that they had lied to each other during their last meeting: Clara lied about her dead boyfriend, Danny Pink, having returned from the Nethersphere, while the Doctor falsely claimed to have found Gallifrey. While investigating the Dream Crabs, the Doctor sends Clara to recover Santa's specimen, only for him to <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> use telepathic connections to their intended victims to see their surroundings, but only when they are being thought about. This causes the specimen in the lab to come alive and attack Clara.|$|E

500|$|Christian [...] {{originally}} thought to cast Bligh adrift in Bountys small jolly boat, {{together with his}} clerk John Samuel and the loyalist midshipmen Hayward and Hallett. This boat proved unseaworthy, so Christian ordered the launching of a larger ship's boat, with a capacity of around ten. However, Christian and his allies had overestimated {{the extent of the}} mutiny—at least half on board were determined to leave with Bligh. Thus the ship's largest boat, a [...] launch, was put into the water. During the following hours the loyalists collected their possessions [...] and [...] entered the boat. Among these was Fryer, who with Bligh's approval sought to stay on board—in the hope, he later claimed, that {{he would be able to}} retake the ship—but Christian ordered him into the launch. Soon, the vessel was badly overloaded, with more than 20 persons and others still vying for places. Christian ordered the two carpenter's mates, Norman and McIntosh, and the armourer, Joseph Coleman, to return to the ship, considering their presence essential if he were to navigate Bounty with a reduced crew. Reluctantly they obeyed, beseeching Bligh to <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had remained with the ship against their will. Bligh assured them: [...] "Never fear, lads, I'll do you justice if ever I reach England".|$|E
2500|$|March 31 [...] Approximately 500 people {{attended}} the funeral service for Mixon. The service included family members, friends, singers and poets, {{and it was}} held at Fuller Funerals on International Boulevard in Oakland. A Nation of Islam minister asked everyone to <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were gathered to support Mixon's family, and one family member spoke of how Mixon had strayed from God.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{prosecution}} and defence have announced they will appeal the sentences. Defence counsel Vrinda Grover stated, “We will file appeals against all convictions in the HC. The evidence, as it stands, cannot withstand legal scrutiny. There {{is no evidence}} to link these workers to the murder. The 13 who have been convicted, it’s important to <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were the leaders of the union. Therefore, it is clear that this is targeted framing of these persons. We hope for justice in the superior court.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Newton County John Does, also dubbed Adam and Brad, {{or simply}} as Victims A and [...] B or Victims 3 and 4, are two young {{unidentified}} males whose remains were discovered {{with those of}} two other men on October 18, 1983 in Lake Village, Newton County, Indiana by mushroom foragers. Their nicknames were given by Newton County coroner Scott McCord, elected in 2008, to <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were people. He learned that the [...] "victims had never been identified, returned to any family or buried". He renewed the investigation, recruiting Stephen Nawrocki, a noted forensic anthropologist at the University of Indianapolis, to examine the remains and help develop descriptions of the victims. Nawrocki also gained {{the assistance of the}} National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, whose experts drew portraits of the young men.|$|E
2500|$|I {{think it}} is well also for {{the man in the}} street to realise that there is no power on earth that can protect him from being bombed. Whatever people may tell him, the bomber will always get through, The only defence is in offence, which means that you have to kill more women and {{children}} more quickly than the enemy if you want to save yourselves...If the conscience of the young men should ever come to feel, with regard to this one instrument [...] that it is evil and should go, the thing will be done; but if they do not feel like that – well, as I say, the future is in their hands. But when the next war comes, and European civilisation is wiped out, as it will be, and by no force more than that force, then do not let them lay blame on the old men. Let them <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>they,</b> principally, or they alone, are responsible for the terrors that have fallen upon the earth.|$|E
