5|$|After {{watching}} a dinosaur show at an arena in Springfield, Lisa discovers {{one of her}} favorite authors, T. R. Francis, working there in a dinosaur costume. The woman reveals to a shocked Lisa that she is just an actress the book publishing company used for the jacket photos, and that T. R. Francis is a complete fabrication. She further reveals that all popular young-adult book series were never each written by a single author with any inspiration, they are conceived by book publishing executives through market research and the use of multiple ghostwriters, just to make more money. When Homer finds out about this, he decides to get rich by group-writing a fantasy novel. He recruits a team consisting of Bart, Principal Skinner, Patty Bouvier, Moe Szyslak, and Professor Frink, all of whom have personal attributes or experiences that will help with writing the book: Skinner knows what teens like, Patty is a fantasy fiction fan, Moe has already published some children's books, and Frink has a computer. Lisa is shocked to find that they are group-writing a book, as she knows the only reason one would do that is to gain money. To show that what they are doing is wrong, she decides to write a novel on her own with a personal story that <b>readers</b> <b>will</b> connect with.|$|E

The rev. gentleman‚Äôs name appears in the roll of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament for 1872, so that here we get another peep into the interior economy of those notorious ‚ÄúWoodard Schools‚Äù, of which Lancing College is the headquarters.|$|E
25|$|As {{the story}} proceeds, one can note that many events are perceptual and not certain. By reading both stories some sense {{can be made}} from this poetic styled puzzle. The words written are a vague mix of poetry and stream of {{consciousness}} prose. Both Hailey and Sam depict their feelings as well as ideas and thoughts towards one another. It is truly difficult to summarize the plot as most <b>readers</b> <b>will</b> understand the parts of story in different ways.|$|E
25|$|Brazelton {{admitted}} in a 2003 interview {{that when he}} started the comic and was unsure as to its potential longevity, he fell back on using himself and those close to him to avoid writing backstories for potentially short-lived characters. This shortcut also hamstrings Brazelton's potential for development; he cannot reveal too much back story of the characters {{out of concern for}} their counterparts' privacy, yet he can't make something up because <b>readers</b> <b>will</b> attribute the fiction to the real person. In 2009, Brazelton confessed that if he were to go back with what he knew now, he would begin again with all-original characters, despite the artificial familiarity it breeds in his fans. The main characters which have been based on real people are author Tom, his wife Cami, their beagle Truman, and Tom's friend Jared. Brazelton has gone on record saying his young son, Henry, will not be joining the comic strip because of the limitations it would put on he and his wife's characters to be responsible and parental.|$|E

500|$|Syllabic values do {{not apply}} within words, {{although}} this was formerly the case. In early documents, Watt writes [...] "people" [...] as êêπêêπêëä {{with the expectation that}} <b>readers</b> <b>will</b> interpret the first êêπ as , but the second êêπ as [...] This contextual value switching was soon done away with, so in later documents, while [...] "bee" [...] is written êê∫, [...] "bees" [...] is written êê∫êê®êëÜ.|$|E
500|$|The book {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} Andrew Cayton and Janet Maslin of The New York Times. Both felt that Chernow {{had been able}} to show an intimate side of Washington that had previously been unrecognized in biographies of the man. Maslin stated that Chernow presented Washington as a [...] "more human and accessible" [...] individual, and Cayton wrote that [...] "ost <b>readers</b> <b>will</b> finish this book feeling as if they have actually spent time with human beings." ...|$|E
500|$|In particular, {{the book}} was praised for its originality, intricacy, action and characters. VOYA says that the book [...] "..is well written, action packed, imaginative, and full of quirky memorable characters...", and Children's Literature agrees that [...] "It is a {{readable}} choice..." [...] The School Library Journal also extensively praised the book, saying [...] "Reluctant or 'hard to fit' <b>readers</b> <b>will</b> find this series enjoyable, as Nix is able to create vivid pictures {{in the minds of}} his readers. Fans of the fantasy genre will appreciate these books for their strong continuity, believable characters, and edge-of-your-seat-action.

500|$|Hoshino {{has been}} highly praised for her art, {{which has been}} {{compared}} to the works of Joe Madureira, Kelley Jones, and Chris Bachalo by one reviewer and described as [...] "some of the best artwork in the business" [...] by another. Her character designs received many positive comments ranging from [...] "especially lovely" [...] to [...] "the most visually striking element" [...] of her art and it is said that both male and female <b>readers</b> <b>will</b> enjoy the designs. However, she has been just as highly criticized for her lack of skill in drawing action scenes, which leads one reviewer to believe she will not or cannot draw physical combat.|$|E
500|$|Brubaker {{wanted to}} examine the reality of being a vigilante, and Kill or Be Killed focuses on the ramifications of {{violence}} {{and its effect on}} the Dylan‚Äôs loved ones. The demonic element to the story also allows Brubaker to play with the idea of [...] "If you had to kill a bad person, who would you pick?" [...] Although Dylan becomes a murderer {{at the beginning of the}} story, Brubaker hopes the character's plight is sympathetic enough that <b>readers</b> <b>will</b> root for him. Dylan's arrangement with the demon has been interpreted as commentary on the War on Terror and the racially motivated violence publicised in the US in the two years prior to the book's publication.|$|E
500|$|The {{new edition}} of The Secret River also {{received}} positive reviews. Publishers Weekly gave it a starred review, as did Kirkus Reviews, calling it a [...] "classic tale... Rawlings‚Äô voice is warm and tender, employing lilting syntax and descriptive language that resonates with warmth and humor. Calpurnia is a sweet delight... filled with love and compassion", and the Dillon's illustrations are, [...] "glorious, glowing... nothing short of breathtaking". Monica and Hannah McRae Young, in their article [...] "Books do justice to subjects of civil rights, racism", praise The Secret River as [...] "A rare picture book depicting everyday black life". They believe modern <b>readers</b> <b>will</b> enjoy Calpunia and Buggy-horse {{as much as the}} original audience. Children's Literature agreed that the reissue would renew interest in the book.|$|E

500|$|The {{reviewer}} for Time {{acknowledged the}} critical storm around Fleming and Dr. No, but was broadly welcoming of the book, writing that while [...] "not all <b>readers</b> <b>will</b> agree that Dr. No... is magnificent writing,... pages of it, at least, qualify for Ezra Pound's classic comment on Tropic of Cancer: 'At last, an unprintable {{book that is}} readable'." [...] In The New York Times, Anthony Boucher‚Äîdescribed by Fleming's biographer John Pearson as [...] "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"‚Äîwas again damning of Fleming's work, saying [...] "it's harder than ever to see why an ardent coterie so admires Ian Fleming's tales". Benson described Boucher's critique as [...] "true to form" [...] and [...] "a tirade" [...] as Boucher concluded his review by saying: [...] "it is 80,000 words long, with enough plot for 8,000 and enough originality for 800." ...|$|E
500|$|DC Comics {{co-publisher}} Dan DiDio {{explained the}} decision by stating that [...] "e didn't want to turn our back on the diversity issue, but she'll always be the most recognizable [...] We are working with concerns to diversify the line. We're always looking to re-position to be reflective of today's audience." [...] Gail Simone, who will be writing the series, stated: [...] "For many years, I got to write the character as Oracle, and there is to this day, no character who means more to me. This is classic Barbara as she was originally conceived, with a few big surprises. It‚Äôs {{a bit of a}} shock, to be sure, but we‚Äôre {{doing everything we can to}} be respectful to this character‚Äôs amazing legacy, while presenting something thrilling that a generation of comics <b>readers</b> <b>will</b> be experiencing for the first time... Barbara Gordon leaping, fighting, and swinging over Gotham. Now, when citizens of that city look up, they are going to see BATGIRL. And that is absolutely thrilling." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{book has}} also been praised for {{covering}} political themes, such as war and genocide, while still maintaining an adventurous feeling. Collins herself has stated that [...] "she spent hours... plotting strategic alliances that would make military sense" [...] {{in a way that}} kept such themes accessible for younger audiences. Publishers Weekly's review of the novel was [...] "starred", an honor reserved for books of [...] "exceptional merit". The reviewer stated, [...] "Collins does a grand job of world-building, with a fine economy of words-no unnecessary details bog down either the setting or the invigorating story. In her world, a child singing [...] "Patty-Cake" [...] can change the course of history and a stoic rat can mourn the fact that although he is able to read, he cannot write because he has no thumb. Unlike Gregor who cannot wait to leave, <b>readers</b> <b>will</b> likely find it to be a fantastically engaging place." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{a review}} {{published}} in 1934, R. Zilegman writes: [...] "The book {{is very interesting}} for the educated reader in general, but the Jewish <b>reader</b> <b>will</b> find it of special interest. The fate of this Armenian tribe recalls, in several important details, {{the fate of the}} people of Israel, and not surprisingly the Jewish <b>reader</b> <b>will</b> discover several familiar motifs, so well known to him from the life and history of his people." ...|$|R
500|$|When Cisneros {{addresses}} {{the subject of}} female sexuality, she often portrays negative scenarios in which men exert control over women through control over their sexuality, and explores the gap she perceives between the real sexual experiences of women and their idealized representation in popular culture. However, Cisneros also describes female sexuality in extremely positive terms, especially in her poetry. This is true, for example, of her 1987 volume of poetry My Wicked, Wicked Ways. According to Madsen, Cisneros refers to herself as [...] "wicked" [...] for having [...] "reappropriated, taken control of, her own sexuality and the articulation of it‚Äì a power forbidden to women under patriarchy". Through these poems she aims to represent [...] "the reality of female sexuality" [...] so that women <b>readers</b> <b>will</b> recognize the [...] "divisive effects" [...] of the stereotypes that {{they are expected to}} conform to, and [...] "discover the potential for joy in their bodies that is denied them".|$|E
500|$|In another {{review of}} the first book, Publishers Weekly noted that Smith [...] "create a fantasy world fit for the most discriminating medieval partisan. It cleverly walks just this side of parody, getting away with lines like, 'I wished I could {{personally}} flout him and his busy searchers, and make him look the fool he was.'" [...] In a similar vein, Kirkus Reviews praised the first novel as [...] "Smith's lush descriptions evoke a fantastic yet credible world, where magic spells and enchanted stones are everyday facts of life." [...] M. Jean Greenlaw, contributing to The ALAN Review, lauded Smith for her [...] "language and imagery" [...] as well as [...] "her deft plotting [...] keep the reader glued to the pages." [...] Writing for the School Library Journal, Patricia Lothrop-Green, however, gave a largely negative review to the first part, highlighting [...] "huge logical leaps," [...] an [...] "utterly predictable plot," [...] and a heroine whom [...] "many <b>readers</b> <b>will</b> be thoroughly tired of" [...] {{by the end of}} the story.|$|E
500|$|Publisher's Weekly said, [...] "It is a {{testament}} to the storytelling that the existence of this parallel world and the convergence of Peter and Thea's stories, told in separate chapters, are both credible and absorbing. Young <b>readers</b> <b>will</b> find this a journey worth taking." [...] Kirkus Reviews found the novel to be a [...] "Thoroughly enjoyable arctic adventure", praising how the adventure tests the main characters' courage as they learn the truth of both worlds. Vicky Smith from Horn Book Magazine found the two main characters well written and the city of Gracehope well structured. While, Smith found the city's origin unbelievable, she recognized that few people would care about that and compared the threat in First Light similar to the one in The City of Ember. Jenifer Hubert from Booklist also compared the novel to The City of Ember and to Neal Shusterman's Downsiders. Hubert criticized the slow beginning and flaws in the mythology and structure of the underground world, but still felt that [...] "the icy setting and global-warming theme are well realized".|$|E
