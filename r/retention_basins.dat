5|$|Laguna Canyon and {{its side}} tributaries have {{received}} some flood control modifications. These include debris basins {{at the mouth}} of nearly every major tributary, stretches of lined or unlined flood control channels, and other structures. The debris basins, sometimes called <b>retention</b> <b>basins,</b> are circular depressions constructed by the Orange County Flood Control Division to slow down flash floods. The upper Laguna Canyon area has a few flood control channels and the lower creek is encased entirely in one; this begins as a riprap channel with an unlined bottom, which transitions to a concrete culvert. These improvements help to protect infrastructure in the canyon from storm and landslide damage.|$|E
25|$|Pollution {{prevention}} practices include low-impact development techniques, {{installation of}} green roofs and improved chemical handling (e.g. management of motor fuels & oil, fertilizers and pesticides). Runoff mitigation systems include infiltration basins, bioretention systems, constructed wetlands, <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> and similar devices.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{pollution}} from runoff {{can be controlled}} by storm water management facilities that absorb the runoff or direct it into groundwater, such as bioretention systems and infiltration basins. <b>Retention</b> <b>basins</b> {{tend to be less}} effective at reducing temperature, as the water may be heated by the sun before being discharged to a receiving stream.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> is a {{hydraulic}} structure for flood mitigation by storing river flow over a design flood. In this study, numerical models were adopted {{to simulate the}} flood mitigation effects by a <b>retention</b> <b>basin.</b> The large flood condition was applied as a boundary condition to consider an abnormal flood caused by climate change. Furthermore, the two-dimensional numerical model was adopted to regenerate the complex flow pattern due to the topography and lateral flow near the <b>retention</b> <b>basin.</b> The numerical results of the one- and two-dimensional model were analyzed and compared. The {{results showed that the}} two-dimensional model is more applicable to assessing flood mitigation by the <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> with a complex topography and lateral flow patterns...|$|R
40|$|In the 1950 s, the Savannah River Site {{built an}} open, unlined <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> to {{temporarily}} store potentially radionuclide contaminated cooling {{water from a}} chemical separations process and storm water drainage from a nearby waste management facility that stored large quantities of nuclear fission byproducts in carbon steel tanks. The <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> was retired from service in 1972 when a new, lined basin was completed. In 1978, the old <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> was excavated, backfilled with uncontaminated dirt, and covered with grass. At the same time, much of the underground process pipeline leading to the basin was abandoned. Since {{the closure of the}} <b>retention</b> <b>basin,</b> new environmental regulations require that the basin undergo further assessment to determine whether additional remediation is required. A visual and radiological inspection of the pipeline was necessary to aid in the remediation decision making process for the <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> system. A teleoperated pipe crawler inspection system was developed to survey the abandoned sections of underground pipelines leading to the retired <b>retention</b> <b>basin.</b> This paper will describe the background to this project, the scope of the investigation, the equipment requirements, and the results of the pipeline inspection...|$|R

25|$|Pollution {{prevention}} practices include {{low impact}} development (LID) or green infrastructure techniques - known as Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) in the UK, and Water-Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) in Australia and the Middle East - {{such as the}} installation of green roofs and improved chemical handling (e.g. management of motor fuels & oil, fertilizers and pesticides). Runoff mitigation systems include infiltration basins, bioretention systems, constructed wetlands, <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> and similar devices.|$|E
25|$|As {{rainfall}} travels over {{roofs and}} the ground, it may pick up various contaminants including soil particles and other sediment, heavy metals, organic compounds, animal waste, {{and oil and}} grease. Some jurisdictions require stormwater to receive some level of treatment before being discharged directly into waterways. Examples of treatment processes used for stormwater include <b>retention</b> <b>basins,</b> wetlands, buried vaults with various kinds of media filters, and vortex separators (to remove coarse solids).|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{there are}} three dams located in Malacca {{supplying}} its residents with water, which are Durian Tunggal Dam in Alor Gajah, Jus Dam and Asahan Dam in Jasin. The fourth dam, Jernih Dam, will be constructed in Taboh Naning in Alor Gajah and {{expected to be completed}} by 2018. There are three major <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> in the state, which are Kesang Satu Lake, Kesang Dua Lake and Ayer Keroh Lake. Raw water is supplied from the Malacca River, Kesang River and Gerisik River.|$|E

25|$|Worldwide {{introduction}} of various mosquito species over large distances into regions {{where they are}} not indigenous has occurred through human agencies, primarily on sea routes, in which the eggs, larvae, and pupae inhabiting water-filled used tires and cut flowers are transported. However, apart from sea transport, mosquitoes have been effectively carried by personal vehicles, delivery trucks, trains, and aircraft. Man-made areas such as storm water <b>retention</b> <b>basins,</b> or storm drains also provide sprawling sanctuaries. Sufficient quarantine measures have proven difficult to implement. In addition, outdoor pool areas make a perfect {{place for them to}} grow.|$|E

500|$|A huge {{volume of}} water from the Columbia River was {{required}} to dissipate the heat produced by Hanford's nuclear reactors. From 1944 to 1971, pump systems drew cooling water from the river and, after treating this water for use by the reactors, returned it to the river. Before its release into the river, the used water was held in large tanks known as <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> for up to six hours. Longer-lived isotopes were not affected by this retention, and several terabecquerels entered the river every day. The federal government kept knowledge about these radioactive releases secret. Radiation was later measured [...] downstream as far west as the Washington and Oregon coasts.|$|E

Procedure: Collect water samples from waste water outfall and run chemical analysis according to procedures in Standard Methods for the Examination of Sewage and Industrial Waste. Findings: Sinclair Refinery {{is located on the}} Houston Ship Channel approxi mately 2 § miles above Washburn Tunnel in Pasadena, Texas. Sinclair employs 2, 000 personnel and processes over 150, 000 barrels of crude per day. Five thousand gallons per minute of waste waters from the refinery enters the Houston Ship Channel after being run through old, outdated oil skimmers.

500|$|In southeastern Washington, a [...] {{stretch of}} the river passes through the Hanford Site, {{established}} in 1943 {{as part of the}} Manhattan Project. The site served as a plutonium production complex, with nine nuclear reactors and related facilities {{along the banks of the}} river. From 1944 to 1971, pump systems drew cooling water from the river and, after treating this water for use by the reactors, returned it to the river. Before being released back into the river, the used water was held in large tanks known as <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> for up to six hours. Longer-lived isotopes were not affected by this retention, and several terabecquerels entered the river every day. By 1957, the eight plutonium production reactors at Hanford dumped a daily average of 50,000curies of radioactive material into the Columbia. These releases were kept secret by the federal government until the release of declassified documents in the late 1980s. Radiation was measured downstream as far west as the Washington and Oregon coasts.|$|E

Mayor Lurie toured the site and immediately agreed with Warren. The Mayor then moved and re-configured the water <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> to preserve the Site.
