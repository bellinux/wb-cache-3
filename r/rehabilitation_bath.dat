40|$|A bathing {{facility}} is distinguished by {{a warm and}} a humidity indoor climate, resulting in large internal climate forces on the climate shield and bearing system. These large climate forces {{are a result of}} the combination of warm air and increased air humidity, caused by the evaporation from water areas. This humidity issue results in a "construction risk" due to the increase in stress on the bathing facility. There are two key aims of this report. The primary aim is to increase the understanding of the impact of indoor climates on facilities in relation to temperature and humidity forces. Secondly, it is to clarify why moisture problems easily appear in these kinds of facilities. Five different bath facilities are alalysed in this study. The report presents the climate in two swimming halls, an adventure bath and two rehabilitation baths. By identifying the climate in these facilities, it is possible to estimate the size of the climate forces. Further to this, the influence of the climate on the installation systems and the bearing system are described. The majority of source data for this report come from interviews with consultant. Thereport also consists of a quatitative study of the climate in bath facilities in order to show the variation of temperature and humidity difference. Three different bath facilities are further analysed, which are a swimming hall, an adventure hall and a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>bath.</b> These values are compared with the projected values and are used in a non stationary diffusion calculation on how the air humidity is distributed. Problems often occur in the roof structure and therefore the calculation is over the climate shelf of a roof. According to new norms in the Swedish Building Code from July 2006, new requirements of maximum state of humidity have been applied. A new verification method have been introduced which further strength the requirement on humidity safety...|$|E
