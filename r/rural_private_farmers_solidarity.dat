40|$|There {{is still}} no {{evidence}} that new farming structures created {{in the process of}} land reform have achieved higher productivity than traditional farms. The most striking achievements of reform include a sharp reduction in state owner-ship of land and a substantial increase in the share of individual farming relative to collective agriculture. Among the <b>rural</b> population, independent <b>private</b> <b>farmers</b> appear to be more optimistic and economically better off than members of collective farm enterprises. This provides qualitative evidence of a positive impact of reform, as <b>private</b> <b>farmers</b> are direct participants in the process of reform, while rural residents who choose to remain in collectives largely shirk exposure to reform and continue to work within a traditional framework...|$|R
40|$|We use the Vietnam Living Standard Survey {{conducted}} in 1993 and in 1998 {{to analyze the}} determinants of <b>private</b> transfers among <b>rural</b> <b>farmers.</b> <b>Private</b> transfers are widespread and important relative to pre-transfer income levels of recipients in both years. Conducting parametric and semiparametric analysis of single-index models for transfer status, we find that private transfers help smoothing income across the life cycle and across states of nature. Pre-transfer income is positively related to the net donor status and negatively associated with the net recipients status, especially for low levels of income. These results suggest that crowding-out of public redistributive policies targeted to the rural poor might be an issue {{to take into account}} in Vietnam. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{analysis}} of the determinants of <b>private</b> <b>farmer</b> access to <b>rural</b> finance in Romania has two distinct aspects: (i) a quantitative evaluation of some measurable variables for example factors affecting the amount of loans and the volume of savings; and (ii) a qualitative aspect, concentrating {{on the relationship between}} financial service suppliers and <b>private</b> <b>farmers.</b> We also consider the motivations underlying the participation or non-participation of <b>private</b> <b>farmers</b> {{in the development of the}} rural financial market. We have estimated two regression models: a) to determine the main characteristics of the private farms that have access to formal credit; and b) to estimate how farm income, the source and utilization of credit each impact on the actual loan amounts obtained.

40|$|The study investigates {{determinants}} of {{affiliation with the}} two strongest associations in Czech agriculture. These represent Agricultural Association grouping large-scale enterprises and Association of <b>Private</b> <b>Farmers,</b> respectively. Our objective is to analyze whether associations with different types of members (large-scale enterprises vs. <b>private</b> <b>farmers)</b> experience different motives for joining or lapsing. Moreover, we investigate if there are characteristics of the associations' members which positively correlate to membership. The results imply that political lobbying is the main entry incentive for both large-scale enterprises and individual farmers. Informal information exchange is a more significant motivation for <b>private</b> <b>farmers</b> than for agricultural enterprises. To {{the question of who}} affiliates, we found that the probability of association membership of individual private farms significantly increases with employment of external workers and their commercial orientation, and the probability of association membership of large-scale agricultural enterprises significantly increases with the increasing share of livestock production on the total agricultural revenues and the increasing share of employee ownership.
