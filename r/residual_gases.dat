40|$|The {{topic of}} this report is "Mobility of Residual Gas in Ormen Lange" {{and it has been}} {{prepared}} {{as a part of the}} course TPG 4915 Petroleum Engineering - Reservoir Engineering, Master Thesis at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The work has been performed on Ormen Lange, a natural gas field on the Norwegian continental shelf, operated by A/S Norske Shell. Substantial volumes of <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> are present in the Ormen Lange field as a result of the hydrodynamic aquifer flow 9. Total <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> volume in 2007 is 80 ± 30 Bcm gas depending on the <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> saturation, Sgr. Depending on scenario 15 ± 6 Bcm of the <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> is recovered in 2040, and the recovery factor of <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> is 15 ± 5 %. In general, with increasing <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> saturation, <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> volume increases and the recovery factor of the <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> zones decreases. The main challenge and purpose of this project has been to understand the physics of <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> during depletion, and to assess the potential recovery from the <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> in different parts of the reservoir. A literature study aiming to identify the main driving parameters with respect to <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> mobility has been conducted and used as a basis for subsequent simulation work. The need to understand the charge history of the field became important in 2008 when an appraisal well in the northern part of the field encountered only <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> saturations in the crest of the structure and in the middle of the Direct Hydrocarbon Indicator (DHI). Core analyses, well logs and geological interpretation obtained during drilling and gas production in Ormen Lange so far allows the assessment of <b>residual</b> <b>gas,</b> and gives indications of where it resides in the reservoir. <b>Residual</b> <b>gas</b> saturations (Sgr) in the range of 0. 21 to 0. 41 have been observed in water-flood core measurements. Recovery of <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> depends on the final reservoir pressure. The recovery from the <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> zone in the south, where the reservoir is well depleted, is good compared to the north where the pressure depletion is limited. Applying the base case <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> saturation value of 0. 3 and assuming no mobility threshold above <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> saturation (critical gas saturation is equal to <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> saturation), the total recovery in 2040 of <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> is 19 %, see Figure 1. Future development plans will increase total <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> recovery, as the pressure will be further depleted. In the South where an acting aquifer is present, recovery from <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> highly depends on the strength of the aquifer. Earlier breakthrough of water with a potential stronger aquifer results in earlier shut-in of the wells, hence higher abandonment pressure and lower recovery of <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> in the south. The critical gas saturation is one of the parameters that has been extensively investigated in this project. The critical gas saturation is the saturation at which a continuous gas flow can be first observed, coinciding with a non-zero gas relative-permeability. Most literature indicates that <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> requires approximately 5 % increase of gas saturation units in order to reach critical gas saturation. The implementation of the latter mobility threshold for <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> in Ormen Lange reduces the total <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> recovery by 2 %. The flow rate of the remobilized gas depends on how fast the gas relative permeability increases during secondary drainage. Hence changing the slope of the gas relative permeability curve, Ng, and the endpoint value, krg, also affects the ultimate recovery of <b>residual</b> <b>gas...</b>|$|R

The influence of <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> expulsion is studied by applying results from a large grid of N-body simulations computed by Baumgardt & Kroupa (2007).

The dry layup method has the least amount of resin waste and can achieve lighter constructions than wet layup. Also, because larger amounts of resin are more difficult to bleed out with wet layup methods, pre-preg parts generally have fewer pinholes.

50|$|The vz. 52 is a shoulder-fired {{semi-automatic}} rifle with a tilting-bolt locking mechanism powered by an annular short-stroke gas piston system. The bolt is locked by two lugs that recess into slots machined into the receiver. However, unlike most vertically-locking breech mechanism, the rifle's bolt has the unusual feature of tipping the bolt frontally {{to lock the}} mechanism, whereas other tipping bolt designs tip the bolt to the rear. The piston is actuated by <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> from the bore, vented into a sleeve surrounding the barrel to overcome the inertia of the bolt carrier, bolt and {{the resistance of the}} return spring in order to unlock the chamber, eject the empty cartridge casing and then introduce a new round into the chamber upon return to battery.|$|E
5000|$|From the {{pressure}} graphs, {{it can be}} seen that the residual pressure in the barrel as the bullet exits is quite high, in this case over 16 kpsi / 110 MPa / 1100 bar. While lengthening the barrel or reducing the amount of propellant gas will reduce this pressure, that often is not possible due to issues of firearm size and minimum required energy. Short-range target guns usually are chambered for [...]22 Long Rifle or [...]22 Short, which have very tiny powder capacities and little residual pressure. When higher energies are required for long-range shooting, hunting or anti-personnel use, high muzzle pressures are a necessary evil. With these high muzzle pressures come increased flash and noise from the muzzle blast, and, due to the large powder charges used, higher recoil. Recoil includes the reaction caused not just by the bullet, but also by the powder mass and speed (with the <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> acting as a rocket exhaust). However, for a muzzle brake to be effective there must be significant muzzle pressure.|$|E

5000|$|Ultra {{lean burn}} or {{stratified}} charge mode {{is used for}} light-load running conditions, at constant or reducing road speeds, where no acceleration is required. The fuel is not injected at the intake stroke but rather at the latter stages of the compression stroke. The combustion {{takes place in a}} cavity on the piston's surface which has a toroidal or an ovoidal shape, and is placed either in the center (for central injector), or displaced {{to one side of the}} piston that is closer to the injector. The cavity creates the swirl effect so that the small amount of air-fuel mixture is optimally placed near the spark plug. This stratified charge is surrounded mostly by air and <b>residual</b> <b>gases,</b> which keeps the fuel and the flame away from the cylinder walls. Decreased combustion temperature allows for lowest emissions and heat losses and increases air quantity by reducing dilation, which delivers additional power. This technique enables the use of ultra-lean mixtures that would be impossible with carburetors or conventional fuel injection.|$|E
50|$|The {{quality of}} a vacuum is {{indicated}} {{by the amount of}} matter remaining in the system, so that a high quality vacuum is one with very little matter left in it. Vacuum is primarily measured by its absolute pressure, but a complete characterization requires further parameters, such as temperature and chemical composition. One of the most important parameters is the mean free path (MFP) of <b>residual</b> <b>gases,</b> which indicates the average distance that molecules will travel between collisions with each other. As the gas density decreases, the MFP increases, and when the MFP is longer than the chamber, pump, spacecraft, or other objects present, the continuum assumptions of fluid mechanics do not apply. This vacuum state is called high vacuum, and the study of fluid flows in this regime is called particle gas dynamics. The MFP of air at atmospheric pressure is very short, 70 nm, but at 100 mPa (~) the MFP of room temperature air is roughly 100 mm, which is on the order of everyday objects such as vacuum tubes. The Crookes radiometer turns when the MFP is larger than the size of the vanes.|$|E
50|$|Sometra {{was founded}} {{as a private}} firm in 1939 {{for the purpose of}} zinc smelting. Initially, it had three {{distillation}} furnaces, with five more added in 1948, the year it was nationalized by the new communist regime. Its initial capacity was 3000 tons of zinc per year, expanded to 4000 tons in 1946. Between 1950 and 1960, capacity was gradually expanded to 28,000 tons a year. In 1955, a unit for producing sulfuric acid was inaugurated. The unit was expanded in 1966, a year that also saw the introduction of a system for agglomerating concentrates of zinc and lead. This was the culmination of a four-year program of thorough restructuring and modernization, with the new equipment having a capacity of 30,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of lead bullion per year. The 1967-1970 period saw the introduction of an electrolytic lead refining system (capacity 24,000 tons a year); a unit for extracting metallic bismuth for technical and pharmaceutical use from anode sludge, as well as gold and silver alloys and antimony slag; a unit for zinc sulfate production; a unit for zinc and ammonium chloride production; and an air preheater. Capacity was doubled between 1975 and 1984. A second zinc and lead extraction unit, with annual capacities of 30,000 tons (zinc) and 20,000 tons (lead) went online, as well as two thermal zinc refineries and greater cadmium refining. In 1983, metallic antimony production began by extracting the metal from slag, along with sodium thioantimoniate and stibnite. In 1984, a second blast furnace began operation, so that the old components built from 1939 to 1957 were retired. Between 1985 and 1989, zinc powder production began and a system for collecting <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> was put in place. In 1988, a 250 m high chimney was built. By 1989, the plant was annually generating 43,490 tons of sulfuric acid (against a projected capacity of 126,000 tons), 23,519 tons of electrolytic lead (below the 38,000 tons projected), 29,840 tons of pure zinc, 2,094 tons of zinc powder, 19 tons of cadmium, 29 tons of bismuth and 195 tons of antimony.|$|E
