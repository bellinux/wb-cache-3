40|$|This {{study of}} the {{relationship}} between the City of London and the Crown in the reigns of Edward VI and Mary brings together the results of original research, based principally on the records of the City Corporation, the City livery companies and the central government, and the work of other historians of sixteenth century London, in particular G D <b>Ramsay,</b> <b>S</b> Rappaport, S Brigden, and I Archer. It examines the interaction between the central and civic governments in a number of areas of mutual concern: finance, overseas and internal trade, taxation, war and rebellion, high politics, patronage and pageantry. In the course of the study an attempt is made to trace the development of the City as a financial centre, to explore its role in relation to the royal debt and to analyse the reasons for the withdrawal and the subsequent restoration of Hanseatic privileges in England. Other issues used to illustrate the liaison between the state and the capital in the mid-sixteenth century include the chantry legislation of 1548, the rebellions of 1549 and 1554, the coups d'etat of 1549 and 1553, and the pageantry provided by the City for Edward VI, Mary and Philip II. The conclusion reached is that, although the Crown had particular need of the capital at this period, both financially, in relation to taxation and to the royal debt, and politically, to validate its regime and to enforce its policies, the relationship was not one-sided. The City establishment continued to require central government support to legitimise its rule, to further the trade of its merchants, to ensure adequate supplies of commodities in the capital and, most importantly, to retain its liberties and privileges...|$|R

40|$|The {{first book}} on popular chemistry, Lučba za svakoga ili popularna kemija (Chem for Everybody or Popular Chemistry) {{was written in}} 1881 by Croatian polyhistor of Slovak origin Bogoslav (Bohuslav) Šulek (1816 – 1895). The book was {{intended}} primarily for poorly educated peasants to help them in their trade; at that time chemistry had been taught {{for no more than}} 20 years at high schools and five years at the University of Zagreb. The popularization of science in Croatia was aided by the foundation of Hrvatsko prirodoslovno društvo (Croatian Society for Natural Sciences) in 1885, and its magazine for popularizing science Priroda (Nature) in 1911. However, there were not many articles on chemistry in the magazine; the authors as well as editors were mostly astronomers, biologists, geologists, and paleontologists, thus chemistry was mostly presented in the context of these disciplines. However, the Croatian Society for Natural Sciences published 123 booklets on popular science, but only 18 in chemistry. After World War I, the leading popular chemistry author was Fran Bubanovia (1883 – 1956), former student of Svante Arrhenius and first chemistry professor at the Zagreb School of Medicine. His books primarily intended to explain to the general public, presumably young people, the role of chemistry and chemical technology in the modern industrial world. His books deal mostly with the life and achievements of famous chemists (D. I. Mendeleev, W. <b>Ramsay,</b> <b>S.</b> Arrhenius, L. Pasteur, E. Fischer, M. Bertholet). His books, Slike iz kemije (Sketches from Chemistry, 1917), Kemija ?ivih biaa (Chemistry of Living Beings, 1918) and Iz moderne kemije (From Modern Chemistry, 1927) were very popular in his time. The first author after World War II was Drago Grdenia (b. 1919), professor at Zagreb Faculty of Science and leading Croatian crystallographer, as well as expert in the history of chemistry. His books deal mostly with the new achievements in chemistry (atomic and molecular structure, X-ray analysis, polymers). The most profluent author of popular science, and especially chemistry, nowadays is Nenad Raos (b. 1951), theoretical chemist from Zagreb; he has written six popular books and authored five exhibitions in chemistry, among others books and exhibitions in other fields of science. He wrote about the history of chemistry, Deset kemijskih pokusa koji su promijenili svijet (Ten Chemical Experiments that Changed the World, 2000), alchemy, Zlatni san (The Golden Dream, 1999), water, Što je voda? (kako za koga) (What is Water? (Depends on the individual), 1996), and also wrote a popular chemical lexicon with about 200 cartoons, Kemijski leksikon u stripu (Chemical Lexicon in Strip Fashion, 2010).

Prvi je tip prevladavao početkom 20. stoljeća, za vrijeme industrijalizacije bio je dominantan drugi tip, dok je treći tip popularizacije došao s potrošačkim društvom. U članku se analizira djelo najplodnijih hrvatskih popularizatora kemije (B. Šulek, F. Bubanović, D. Grdenić, N.

40|$|The Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) {{is a new}} {{facility}} instrument for Subaru Telescope which will be installed in around 2017. It is a multi-object spectrograph fed by about 2400 fibers placed at the prime focus covering a hexagonal field-of-view with 1. 35 deg diagonals and capable of simultaneously obtaining data of spectra with wavelengths ranging from 0. 38 um to 1. 26 um. The spectrograph system is composed of four identical modules each receiving the light from 600 fibers. Each module incorporates three channels covering the wavelength ranges 0. 38 - 0. 65 mu ("Blue"), 0. 63 - 0. 97 mu ("Red"), and 0. 94 - 1. 26 mu ("NIR") respectively; with resolving power which progresses fairly smoothly from about 2000 in the blue to about 4000 in the infrared. An additional spectral mode allows reaching a spectral resolution of 5000 at 0. 8 mu (red). The proposed optical design {{is based on a}} Schmidt collimator facing three Schmidt cameras (one per spectral channel). This architecture is very robust, well known and documented. It allows for high image quality with only few simple elements (high throughput) {{at the expense of the}} central obscuration, which leads to larger optics. Each module has to be modular in its design to allow for integration and tests and for its safe transport up to the telescope: this is the main driver for the mechanical design. In particular, each module will be firstly fully integrated and validated at LAM (France) before it is shipped to Hawaii. All sub-assemblies will be indexed on the bench to allow for their accurate repositioning. This paper will give an overview of the spectrograph system which has successfully passed the Critical Design Review (CDR) in 2014 March and which is now in the construction phase.

40|$|The Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) is an optical/near-infrared multi-fiber {{spectrograph}} with 2394 science fibers, {{which are}} distributed in 1. 3 degree diameter {{field of view}} at Subaru 8. 2 -meter telescope. The simultaneous wide wavelength coverage from 0. 38 um to 1. 26 um, with the resolving power of 3000, strengthens its ability to target three main survey programs: cosmology, Galactic archaeology, and galaxy/AGN evolution. A medium resolution mode with resolving power of 5000 for 0. 71 um to 0. 89 um also will be available by simply exchanging dispersers. PFS takes the role for the spectroscopic part of the Subaru Measurement of Images and Redshifts project, while Hyper Suprime-Cam works on the imaging part. To transform the telescope plus WFC focal ratio, a 3 -mm thick broad-band coated glass-molded microlens is glued to each fiber tip. A higher transmission fiber is selected for the longest part of cable system, while one with a better FRD performance is selected for the fiber-positioner and fiber-slit components, given the more frequent fiber movements and tightly curved structure. Each Fiber positioner consists of two stages of piezo-electric rotary motors. Its engineering model has been produced and tested. Fiber positioning will be performed iteratively by taking an image of artificially back-illuminated fibers with the Metrology camera located in the Cassegrain container. The camera is carefully designed so that fiber position measurements are unaffected by small amounts of high special-frequency inaccuracies in WFC lens surface shapes. Target light carried through the fiber system reaches one of four identical fast-Schmidt spectrograph modules, each with three arms. Prototype VPH gratings have been optically tested. CCD production is complete, with standard fully-depleted CCDs for red arms and more-challenging thinner fully-depleted CCDs with blue-optimized coating for blue arms.

40|$|Placental {{morphogenesis}} {{and nutrient}} transfer function are regulated by growth factors at the foeto-maternal interface. Interleukin (IL) - 10, {{expressed in the}} decidua and placenta, is implicated in regulating extravillous cytotrophoblast invasion through inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase expression and influencing {{the quality of the}} maternal immune response. Our laboratory has previously found that IL- 10 deficiency in both the mother and foetus increases foetal weight at day 18 without altering placental weight suggesting that the placenta has a greater functional capacity when IL- 10 is absent. The present study has used IL- 10 null mutant (IL- 10 -/-) mice to investigate the role of IL- 10 in placental development. Placental structure was assessed in adult virgin IL- 10 -/- or wild-type (IL- 10 +/+) mice mated with males of the same genotype and sacrificed at day 18 of gestation. Mid-sagittal cross sections of placental tissue were stained with Masson's trichrome or immuno-labelled with MTS- 12 and pan-cytokeratin reactive antibodies to identify foetal endothelial cells and trophoblasts, respectively, and examined with video image analysis. IL- 10 deficiency increased the total cross sectional area of the placenta by 28 per cent (IL- 10 -/- n= 22 placentae from 8 dams, IL- 10 +/+n = 21 placentae from 9 dams, P= 0. 026), principally through increasing the cross sectional area of placental labyrinth by 37 per cent (P= 0. 025). The proportion of maternal blood space in the labyrinth was increased by 26 per cent (P= 0. 001) and that of trophoblast was decreased by 16 per cent (P= 0. 001) in IL- 10 -/- placentae. The surface area of trophoblast per gram of labyrinth was increased by 41 per cent (P= 0. 0005) in IL- 10 -/- placentae. In the absence of IL- 10, structural correlates of placental function are enhanced consistent with concomitant increases in foetal growth. These data indicate that IL- 10 is a regulator of placental morphogenesis, acting to retard expansion of the placental labyrinth and to modify the architecture of the maternal blood sinuses. Since previous studies have paradoxically shown that postnatal growth is impaired in IL- 10 null mutants, these observations are consistent with a role for IL- 10 in regulating placental development and foetal programming.

40|$|Extent: 10 p. Background: Physical maps {{employing}} libraries {{of bacterial}} artificial chromosome (BAC) clones are essential for comparative genomics and sequencing of large and repetitive genomes {{such as those of}} the hexaploid bread wheat. The diploid ancestor of the D-genome of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum), Aegilops tauschii, is used as a resource for wheat genomics. The barley diploid genome also provides a good model for the Triticeae and T. aestivum since it is only slightly larger than the ancestor wheat D genome. Gene co-linearity between the grasses can be exploited by extrapolating from rice and Brachypodium distachyon to Ae. tauschii or barley, and then to wheat. Results: We report the use of Ae. tauschii for the construction of the physical map of a large distal region of chromosome arm 3 DS. A physical map of 25. 4 Mb was constructed by anchoring BAC clones of Ae. tauschii with 85 EST on the Ae. tauschii and barley genetic maps. The 24 contigs were aligned to the rice and B. distachyon genomic sequences and a high density SNP genetic map of barley. As expected, the mapped region is highly collinear to the orthologous chromosome 1 in rice, chromosome 2 in B. distachyon and chromosome 3 H in barley. However, the chromosome scale of the comparative maps presented provides new insights into grass genome organization. The disruptions of the Ae. tauschii-rice and Ae. tauschii-Brachypodium syntenies were identical. We observed chromosomal rearrangements between Ae. tauschii and barley. The comparison of Ae. tauschii physical and genetic maps showed that the recombination rate across the region dropped from 2. 19 cM/Mb in the distal region to 0. 09 cM/Mb in the proximal region. The size of the gaps between contigs was evaluated by comparing the recombination rate along the map with the local recombination rates calculated on single contigs. Conclusions: The physical map reported here is the first physical map using fingerprinting of a complete Triticeae genome. This study demonstrates that global fingerprinting of the large plant genomes is a viable strategy for generating physical maps. Physical maps allow the description of the co-linearity between wheat and grass genomes and provide a powerful tool for positional cloning of new genes.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is responsible for}} : 1 / 8 of deaths around the world. While the importance of air quality {{has led to a}} boom in inexpensive air sensors, {{studies have shown that the}} status quo of sparse, fixed sensors cannot accurately capture personal exposure levels of nearby populations. Especially in urban landscapes, pollutant concentrations can vary over just a few seconds or a few meters. Unfortunately, the portable monitors that are capable of accurately measuring these pollutants cost thousands of dollars. That hasn't stopped a deluge of cheap, portable consumer devices from entering the market. These solutions frequently claim better accuracy, but universally fail under real-world validation. Instead of competing to build a more accurate sensor, we take the approach of trying to predict when we can trust the cheap sensor we have, based on ambient conditions and measurements. Well-designed, sub-$ 100 sensors have recently started to perform with high precision and accuracy. While their fundamental operation is sound, these affordable sensors cannot incorporate costly, industry standard techniques for mitigating issues like cross-sensitivity, dynamic airflow, or high humidity. Fortunately, if the core principles of the device are robust, machine learning techniques should be able to predict systematic measurement failure based on a handful of related indicators. In this thesis, we test and demonstrate the potential for logistic regression machine learning techniques to predict and classify sensor measurements as 'correct' or 'incorrect' with high reliability. These techniques are also useful for quantifying sensor precision as well as cross-seasonal prediction strength. After demonstrating the value of this approach, we implement a scalable database solution using a semantic web technology know as ChainAPI. The tools developed for this framework allow automatic learning algorithms to crawl through the database, access the most recent data, update their training model, and populate the database with the processed data for other crawling scripts to interact with. This backend has implications for air quality data storage, interaction, and exchange. Finally, we build a portable, Bluetooth enabled air quality device that connects to ChainAPI through a mobile phone app, and takes advantage of the machine learning algorithms running in its backend. This device improves the reliability of sensor data compared with similar-cost systems. The learnAir device empowers individuals to trust their personal air quality data, and provokes a dialog about sensor reliability in the citizen sensing community. Its novel database architecture promotes new ways of interacting with large, dynamic datasets, and new tools to characterize affordable sensors and devices. Finally, applied logistic regression algorithms assure the accuracy of cheap, distributed sensor data- creating a trusted way for researchers to collaborate with citizen scientists from around the world. by David B. <b>Ramsay.</b> Thesis: <b>S.</b> M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Architecture and Planning, Program in Media Arts and Sciences, 2016.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} tlhe {{problem of}} routing {{in a network}} where the travel times along the arcs are modeled as independent random variables. A standard approach to routing in such networks is to select a path with the least expected travel time. One {{of the problems with}} this approach {{is that it does not}} take into consideration factors such as the travel time variance. Additionally. such an approach implicitly assumes each user in the network has the same routing objective. In this thesis we develop an approach to routing in probabilistic networks in which these problems are addressed. The fundamental concept in our approach is that, for a given user with a set of routing options at a given node. we approximate the distributions of travel time for these options. Using these approximate distributions, the options are compared according to a user-specified routing objective, and the best option is selected. The primary benefit of this approach is that one is not limited to a particular routing objective as the computed distributions of travel time allow us to efficiently determine an effective routing option for a arbitrary routing objective that depends on factors of random travel time other than the mean. The distribution of travel time adopted in this thesis is the minimum travel time probability distribution. which is the distribution of travel time over all fastest paths. In a class of networks termed as series-parallel networks. the minimum travel time distribution can be calculated efficiently. (cont.) For general, non-series-parallel networks. the approximation we adopt is the minimum travel time distribution obtained from a related series-parallel network. The performance and the benefits of this approach to routing are illustrated on three networks. The numerical results are obtained using an efficient implementation of the algorithms proposed in this thesis. We also consider the problem of generating an acyclic graph from a cyclic graph, and we propose a data structure that allows for the efficient calculation of the sum and minimum of independent random variables. by Jonathan <b>Ramsay</b> Key.

To the trustees of the Australian Museum and Mr. Ramsay, he said, they were under special compliment for valuable additions to their Museum. Mr. Ramsay had it in his power to be serviceable to them, and he had always exercised it in their favour. It was to the Trustees and him they were indebted for the valuable collection of New Guinea and other birds which were displayed on their table that evening. The Chairman said he had, on the part of the council, to make the gratifying announcement to the Fellows of the society that since their last meeting they had received from the executors of the late Dr. Joseph Milligan a legacy of £ 350, which was to be devoted to furthering the various objects of the society. Although it was nearly 30 years since Dr. Milligan quitted Tasmania for Europe, he had nevertheless taken a vivid interest in the affairs of the society, and this had culminated in his final act of bequeathing such a handsome legacy to the institution he loved so well. Those who had the privilege of enjoying the intimate acquaintance of Dr. Milligan while he was secretary of this society would remember the zeal with which he threw himself into the advocacy of the building of the museum. Lieut. C. E.
