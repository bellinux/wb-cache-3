50|$|Episode 86: Ravan {{goes to the}} swayamvara and {{fails to}} <b>lift</b> the bow. <b>Ram</b> <b>lifts</b> it easily.|$|R
5000|$|A {{standard}} {{dump truck}} is a truck chassis with a dump body mounted to the frame. The bed is {{raised by a}} vertical hydraulic ram mounted under {{the front of the}} body, or a horizontal hydraulic ram and lever arrangement between the frame rails, and the back of the bed is hinged {{at the back of the}} truck. The tailgate can be configured to swing up on top hinges (and sometimes also to fold down on lower hinges) or it can be configured in the [...] "High Lift Tailgate" [...] format wherein pneumatic <b>rams</b> <b>lift</b> the gate open and up above the dump body.|$|R
50|$|The first main club sponsor for the <b>Rams</b> was Easi <b>Lift</b> Loading Systems. Their logo {{appeared}} on the players' on-and-off field clothing. In 2012, Grosvenor Casino Huddersfield became the club's main sponsor.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} round of the grand final, Roadblock faced Cassius; this {{wedge-shaped}} robot was armed with a pneumatic <b>lifting</b> <b>ram</b> which enabled it to not only flip other robots but also right itself to its wheels if inverted. Roadblock's lower ground clearance proved decisive in its early attacks, as Cassius became beached on top of Roadblock's wedge. Cassius escaped, but was turned over by Sir Killalot. It righted itself with the <b>lifting</b> <b>ram,</b> before using its weapon to turn Roadblock onto its side, leaving it immobile. Although out of the running for a second successive title, Roadblock pitted Killertron in a play-off battle to claim third place.|$|R
5000|$|The system {{employs a}} series of {{hydraulic}} <b>rams</b> to hook, <b>lift</b> and hoist the container onto the chassis of the truck. There are several configuration options, and strict guidelines which must be followed {{to ensure that the}} container is secured on the truck in transit.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{authorities}} and army started witch-hunting, {{hundreds of people}} were incarcerated. On getting the news of causality {{in the process of}} snapping telephone lines Ram Prasad Nautiyal and his associates started a search for the dead-body of their companion, <b>Ram</b> Prasad himself <b>lifted</b> the body on his shoulder brought it to a nearby river bank and quietly performed the rituals with changing of Vande Mataram in the night itself.|$|R
6000|$|So the furs were {{restored}} {{and the gold}} and the jewels parcelled out among the owners, and in due course Mr. Yahi-Bahi and Mr. <b>Ram</b> Spudd were <b>lifted</b> up into the patrol wagon where they seated themselves with a composure worthy of the best traditions of Jehumbabah and Bahoolapore. In fact, Mr. Spudd was heard to address the police as [...] "boys," [...] and to remark that they had [...] "got them good" [...] that time.|$|R
5000|$|His grandson, John Miskin, {{writing in}} 2003, {{recalled}} <b>Ram</b> politely <b>lifting</b> his straw boater hat as he greeted his nanny as they met while walking in Kensington Gardens in 1933, adding: ‘I was only five {{at the time}} yet I have a distinct image of an estremely dapper little man, immaculately dressed and carrying a cane or a tightly rolled umbrella. I’ve been told {{that he was no}} more than about 5ft 5in tall. He was debonair, reminding me in postwar days of a smaller Maurice Chevalier. His sporting prowess is entirely consistent with my impressions of a very athletic grandpa joining me, my brother and cousins in a game of catch in the garden at Dymchurch in 1936. He outran all of us and, leaping over a low gate, tripped and fell, breaking his nose!’ ...|$|R
50|$|Between 1988 and 2013, {{the bridge}} carried the {{elevated}} Sydney Monorail, which travelled between Darling Harbour and the Sydney central business district. The monorail track {{rested on a}} pivot that allowed the track to remain stationary while the bridge swung underneath. The pivot allowed the monorail to continue to cross the bridge even when the bridge was opened. Upon {{the closure of the}} Monorail in June 2013 the hydraulic <b>lifting</b> <b>rams</b> and support infrastructure were removed, and the control cab was to be relocated to its original position {{in the middle of the}} bridge.|$|R
50|$|Almost every tractor today {{features}} Ferguson's three-point linkage or {{a derivative}} of it. This hitch allows for easy attachment and detachment of implements while allowing the implement {{to function as}} a part of the tractor, almost as if it were attached by a fixed mount. Previously, when the implement hit an obstacle, the towing link would break or the tractor could flip over. Ferguson's genius was to combine a connection via two lower and one upper lift arms that were connected to a hydraulic <b>lifting</b> <b>ram.</b> The ram was, in turn, connected to the upper of the three links so the increased drag (as when a plough hits a rock) caused the hydraulics to lift the implement until the obstacle was passed.|$|R
2500|$|Basil {{was first}} modeled on Bing Crosby, but the animators {{eventually}} took inspiration from Leslie Howard. Initially, Ratigan {{had been designed}} as thin, weasely, and ratlike. Following the screening of Champagne for Caesar, Glen Keane noted that following the casting of Price, [...] "is expressive voice and attitude inspired us to further redesign the character." [...] Additionally, during one story meeting, Glen Keane decided to base the stature of Ratigan on then-Disney CEO Ron Miller, who was a 6'6" [...] former football player for the Los Angeles <b>Rams.</b> Furthermore, Keane <b>lifted</b> his personality as he was thumbing through these [...] "photographs of people of London in the 1800s, of railroad men, {{and there was this}} one guy smoking a cigar — he had a top hat and there was just something about this guy — this Ratigan...this rat sucking the cigar, completely dressed to the hilt, he was sharp and perfect — he's a sewer rat dressed like a king and he lives as a king!" [...] The following supervising animators included Mark Henn for Basil, Hendel Butoy for Dawson, Rob Minkoff for Olivia, Andreas Deja for Queen Moustoria, Ruben Aquino for Mrs. Judson, and Mike Gabriel for Toby and Felicia.|$|R
50|$|A {{bottle jack}} or whiskey jack is a jack which resembles a bottle in shape, having a {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} neck. Within is a vertical <b>lifting</b> <b>ram</b> with a support pad of some kind fixed to the top. The jack may be hydraulic or work by screw action. In the hydraulic version the hydraulic ram emerges from the body vertically by hydraulic pressure provided by a pump either on the baseplate or at a remote location via a pressure hose. With a single action piston the lift range is somewhat limited, so its use for lifting vehicles is limited to those with a relatively high clearance. For lifting structures such as houses the hydraulic interconnection of multiple vertical jacks through valves enables the even distribution of forces while enabling close control of the lift. The screw version of the bottle jack works by turning a large nut running on the threaded vertical ram at {{the neck of the}} body. The nut has gear teeth and is turned by a bevel gear spigotted to the body, the bevel gear being turned manually by a jack handle fitting into a square socket. The ram may have a second screwed ram within it, which doubles the lifting range telescopically.|$|R
