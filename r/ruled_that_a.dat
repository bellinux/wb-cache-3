5|$|When the {{government}} seeks to burden a person's protected liberty interest or property interest, the Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that, at a minimum, {{the government}} provide the person notice, {{an opportunity to}} be heard at an oral hearing, and a decision by a neutral decision maker. For example, such process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil service employees, expel a student from public school, or cut off a welfare recipient's benefits. The Court has also ruled that the Due Process Clause requires judges to recuse themselves in cases where the judge has a conflict of interest. For example, in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. (2009), the Court <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to that court.|$|E

5|$|Heading into Memorial Day Weekend, United {{wrapped up}} May {{with the opening}} match of their two-game West Coast road trip on 29 May at Jeld-Wen Field {{to take on the}} Portland Timbers. The Timbers, who held a 5–3–2 record prior to the match had won every single match at home during MLS play. United {{successfully}} ended that home streak with a 3–2 victory over the Timbers, thanks to goals from Perry Kitchen, his first professional goal in his career, as well as Chris Pontius and Josh Wolff. In the match, Kitchen opened the scoring for United with a 13th-minute half-volley thanks to a redirected header from Dejan Jakovic. While United were able to hold the 1–0 lead well into the second half of play, a chain of contentious decisions from center official Geoff Gamble, but primarily linesmen Eric Proctor. It was only the second MLS match that Gamble officiated, with his first coming on the previous weekend. In the 67th minute of play, United conceded a penalty kick to the Timbers. United goalkeeper, Bill Hamid initially saved Timbers striker Kenny Cooper's first penalty shot, only for the shot to be retaken. Proctor flagged for a retaking of the kick claiming that Hamid stepping off his line before the kick was taken, an infraction of the rules. The contrasting argument from Hamid, as well as other United players, was that Cooper stutter-stepped before taking the ball, which is illegal in the Laws of the Game. Nevertheless, it was <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> second retake would be taken, again by Cooper. Hamid consecutively saved the shot, only for Proctor to again rule that Hamid repeated the same original infraction. The ruling caused Hamid to storm over to Proctor in disdain for his decision, consequently earning Hamid a yellow card for dissent. For the third shot on the mark, Timbers captain Jack Jewsbury took the shot and buried it in the bottom left-hand post, leveling the score at 1–1. The stalemate was tentative, as Diego Chara of the Timbers conceded a penalty in the box when he mistimed a slide tackle on Pontius, leading to a handball. Pontius scored his second penalty of the season, and his second consecutive in league play to give United the 2–1 advantage. A quarter of an hour later, Wolff notched a goal, extending United's lead in the 85th minute. The Timbers' Jorge Perlaza scored a consolation goal in the 88th minute of play, but it would fail to be enough.|$|E
