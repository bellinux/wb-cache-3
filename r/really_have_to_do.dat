500|$|Following the {{box office}} success of J. J. Abrams' Star Trek reboot and the {{announcement}} that actors Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto had tentatively agreed to appear in two sequels, Internet rumors began circulating about {{the plot of the}} second film. Abrams hinted that because of the alternate timeline created in the first film, reintroducing Khan into Star Trek lore remained a possibility. Abrams told MTV, [...] " [...] exist—and while their history may not be exactly as people are familiar with, I would argue that a person's character is what it is," [...] Abrams said of the notion that his Khan could be just as evil, even if Kirk never stranded him on Ceti Alpha V. [...] "Certain people are destined to cross paths and come together, and Khan is out there... even if he doesn't have the same issues." [...] Writer Damon Lindelof declared that Khan's [...] "intense gravity," [...] particularly regarding the character's delivery of monologues, made him an obligatory character to use, even if its iconic status made the crew afraid of the fan reaction. Lindelof jokingly stated that [...] "it was never really a 'Should we or shouldn't we?' as much as it was 'We <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this but if we don't get it right people are going to kill us.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Of course, it's not {{actually}} necessary {{to exclude the}} entire line segment from z = 0 to ∞ to construct a domain in which Γ(z) is holomorphic. All we <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is puncture the plane at a countably infinite set of points {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. But a closed contour in the punctured plane might encircle {{one or more of}} the poles of Γ(z), giving a contour integral that is not necessarily zero, by the residue theorem. By cutting the complex plane we ensure not only that Γ(z) is holomorphic in this restricted domain– we also ensure that the contour integral of Γ over any closed curve lying in the cut plane is identically equal to zero.|$|E

Gardens, galleries, staircases, statues, paintings, all are interesting, with a mingled air of care and neglect which is peculiarly charming, though perhaps the keener sensibilities, the morbider nerves may suffer from the glare and hardness of the tiling which render the place so wonderful and so exquisite. One must complain of something, and I complain of the tiling; I do not mind the house being supposed like the house of Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem.|$|E

6000|$|Half {{the controversies}} about {{the freedom of}} the will would have had no existence, if this pithy {{paragraph}} had been well pondered by those who oppose the doctrine of necessity. For they rest upon the absurd presumption that the proposition, [...] "I can do as I like," [...] is contradictory to the doctrine of necessity. The answer is; nobody doubts that, at any rate within certain limits, you can do as you like. But what determines your likings and dislikings? Did you make your own constitution? Is it your contrivance that one thing is pleasant and another is painful? And even if it were, why did you prefer to make it after the one fashion rather than the other? The passionate assertion of the consciousness of their freedom, which is the favourite refuge of the opponents of the doctrine of necessity, is mere futility, for nobody denies it. What they <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> if they would upset the necessarian argument, is to prove that they are free to associate any emotion whatever with any idea whatever; to like pain as much as pleasure; vice as much as virtue; in short, to prove, that, whatever may be the fixity of order of the universe of things, that of thought is given over to chance.|$|E
