40|$|We have {{developed}} an intelligent tutor for <b>teaching</b> <b>remedial</b> mathematics to community college students. This domain is fairly narrow in scope and {{is an important component}} of the college curriculum. The target audience often retains fragments of knowledge from previous courses which can aid them in learning; alternately, misconceptions can present conceptual stumbling blocks if students have misremembered what they learned previously. Thus, a system built with a strong student model can greatly benefit the teaching process. The tutor described in this paper tracks student skills along with a general acquisition factor, and uses this information for topic selection, problem generation, problem presentation, and dynamic feedback. 1 Introduction Designing an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) to <b>teach</b> <b>remedial</b> mathematics presents several difficulties.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{exploratory}} {{study was to investigate}} the quality of arithmetic education for children with cerebral palsy. The use of individual educational plans, amount of arithmetic instruction time, arithmetic instructional grouping, and type of arithmetic teaching method were explored in three groups: children with cerebral palsy (CP) in special (CP-special; n = 41) and mainstream schools (CP-mainstream; n = 16) and a control group in mainstream schools (n = 16). The majority of individual educational plans did not include well-formulated arithmetic goals and many were not based on optimal assessment. Special schools scheduled much less arithmetic instruction time. Many CP-mainstream children received individualized instruction, which may help to explain why their arithmetic performance did not differ from controls. <b>Remedial</b> arithmetic <b>teaching</b> methods used in special schools {{did not seem to be}} optimal, but more research is required.

5000|$|In {{elementary}} and high schools, pupils are assessed annually {{by a team of}} teachers who determine whether they advanced enough {{to move on to the}} next grade. Since forcing a pupil to retake the year (blijven zitten; literally, [...] "stay seated") has a profound impact on the pupil's life in terms of social contacts and remaining in the educational system longer, this decision is not taken lightly and mechanisms are in place to avert retaking years, such as <b>remedial</b> <b>teaching</b> and other forms of guidance. As a result, retaking a year is uncommon, but it happens more often in elementary schools than in high schools because there are fewer negative consequences at a younger age. Gifted children are sometimes granted the opportunity to skip an entire year, yet this happens rarely and usually happens in elementary schools.|$|E

In 1987, Sik Sik Yuen’s board of directors granted HK$6,000,000 {{for the construction of a}} new wing in the otherwise car-park area. The construction work started in early November 1989 and was completed in July 1991. The school had the honour to have Mr. Lan Hon-tsung, Regional Secretary, to open the new wing on 26 September 1991. The new wing consists of a number of dedicated facilities: Home Economics Room, Design and Technology Room, Science Laboratory, a computer room as well as two <b>remedial</b> <b>teaching</b> classrooms. The school’s facilities have been further enhanced under the School Improvement Programme (SIP) in 1997. A green plot was redeveloped into a new annex, with the addition of a new staff room, a conference room and four classrooms. A room on the ground floor was also reserved for the Parents Teachers Association Resource Centre, which hugely helps strengthen the relationship between the parents and the school. The annex under SIP was officially opened by Dr. Cheung Wing-ming on 26 November 1999, the school’s 30th anniversary.|$|E
