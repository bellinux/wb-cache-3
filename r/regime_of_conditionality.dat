The Government insists sanctions are not punitive, but critics call this into question. In particular, the regime has been charged with disproportionately affecting vulnerable people. Based on a survey and qualitative interviews with homeless people, this paper shows that they are disproportionately sanctioned, and argues that it is difficult to see the regime as anything but punishment - punishment not for refusing to participate in the labour market, but for being unable to do so through homelessness, poverty, and ill-health...|$|E
40|$|When {{the major}} {{international}} organizations were {{established at the}} close of World War II, it was understood that they were concerned with international relations-political, economic, and social. As was made explicit in the U. N. Charter, but applicable in all the organizations, matters 2 ̆ 2 essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state 2 ̆ 2 were not the concern of the international organizations or the international community. In particular, the International Monetary Fund was to focus on member states 2 ̆ 7 balance of payments, exchange rates, and exchange controls, but not on their domestic policies or priorities. Gradually, {{it became clear that the}} wall between domestic and international policies could not be maintained. As the IMF moved to a <b>regime</b> <b>of</b> <b>conditionality</b> for the use of its resources, and thereafter to performance targets and deadlines, domestic policies of states became subjects of examination in ever increasing detail. Not only national budgets, taxes, and the money supply, but subsidies, wage policies, competition law, corporate governance, even accounting practices and regulatory reform became subject to scrutiny, negotiation and commitment. The Essay does not condemn this erosion of sovereignty, but points out that neither the member states nor the IMF have come up with a new theory to reflect the new reality, or reached agreement on where a new boundary may be set between national and international concerns...|$|E

The article outlines a conceptual framework for comparative study of pre-accession and post-accession conditionality.

40|$|A common {{feature in}} {{programs}} of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is the use <b>of</b> <b>conditionalities,</b> macroeconomic and structural measures that a requesting country should adopt to obtain an assistance package. The objective of this work is to conduct an empirical analysis {{of the economic and}} political determinants <b>of</b> such <b>conditionalities.</b> In particular, our main contribution consists {{in the development of a}} new measure <b>of</b> <b>conditionality,</b> fiscal adjustment, and its comparison with the most used in the literature, the number of conditions. We choose fiscal adjustment because it is an adequate proxy for program austerity, since its implementation carries economic and political costs. In the empirical exercise, we use data from 184 programs in the period of 1999 and 2012, and estimate how our two measures <b>of</b> <b>conditionalities</b> respond to the economic and political factors. Our results suggest that they are quite different. The main determinant of the number of conditions is the political proximity of the borrowing country to the Fund’s major shareholders, the members of G 5. On the other hand, the main determinant of fiscal adjustment is the size of the government fiscal deficit. Finally, we did not find correlation between the size of fiscal adjustment and the number of conditions. These results suggest that the analysis of the content of IMF programs should take into account the different measures <b>of</b> agreed <b>conditionality...</b>|$|R

We specify a dynamic common agency {{model in which}} a government committed to reform faces domestic opposition from interest groups.

40|$|IMF {{conditionality}} is controversial, and assessments reflect {{assumptions about}} the degree of delegation the organization enjoys from its member countries. We use a dataset drawn from the IMF’s records <b>of</b> <b>conditionality</b> to test two models of the design of conditionality: a public-choice and an informal governance model. Public-choice critics argue that the Fund is an out-of-control agency that seeks to maximize its importance by imposing the highest levels <b>of</b> <b>conditionality</b> the market will bear. To the contrary, {{we find that the}} Fund has refrained from exploiting the vulnerability of particular countries to maximize the scope <b>of</b> <b>conditionality.</b> Alternatively, critics <b>of</b> major-power influence in the IMF claim that conditionality reflects the interests of the major shareholders rather than the needs of borrowing countries. We find evidence of U. S. influence, which operates to constrain conditionality, but only in vulnerable countries that are important recipients of U. S. aid. In ordinary countries under ordinary circumstances, broad authority is delegated to the Fund, which adjusts conditionality to accommodate local circumstances and domestic political opposition...|$|R
40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{effectiveness}} of the EU’s use <b>of</b> <b>conditionality,</b> two questions in particular must be answered. Firstly, by using conditionality, does the EU reach its objective of encouraging respect for human rights and democratic principles? Answering this, however, is difficult and will not be attempted here. Some states may have been implementing democratic reforms or improving their human rights performance anyway; others may be impervious to outside influence. The EU’s influence would have to be isolated from that of other international or domestic actors. Before the first question can be fully answered, another question must be addressed. To what extent does the EU actually apply <b>conditionality?</b> The success <b>of</b> the EU’s attempts to encourage countries to respect human rights and democratize will, to a certain extent, depend on how consistently the EU actually follows its own pronouncements. Perceived inconsistency in the EU’s application <b>of</b> <b>conditionality</b> could diminish its influence.

Second, the Fund has refrained from imposing maximum levels <b>of</b> <b>conditionality</b> when countries are vulnerable, instead relaxing conditionality for countries actively seeking Fund support and hence already facing compelling incentives to reform.

40|$|The rapid {{enlargement}} of the European Union (EU) is transforming its borders and responsibilities. In the post-enlargement era, the EU is seeking a policy tool to continue the extension of EU international influence. The European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) was established in 2003 as a tool that would extend EU influence in neighboring regions without precluding further enlargement. The EU designed the ENP as a form on conditionality, to offer incentives to neighboring countries to implement economic and political reforms. This paper aims to address {{the gap in the}} current literature on ENP by analyzing the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>conditionality</b> and questioning whether the policy is in fact conditionality. Due to its decades of experience in implementing political and economic, this paper utilizes IFI (International Financial Institution) lending policies to create a traditional definition <b>of</b> <b>conditionality.</b> Important characteristics <b>of</b> traditional <b>conditionality</b> include the clear definition of incentives and conditions, a limited number of conditions, and a development-focused purpose. A significant blind-spot in the current literature on ENP is the lack of rigorous inspection <b>of</b> the <b>conditionality</b> mechanism. In the great majority <b>of</b> the literature, <b>conditionality</b> is assumed to be the mechanism that drives the ENP.

The Cape Verde-EU relations have been intensifying {{in the last decade}} resulting in the the signing of a Special Partnership between them. Cape Verde keeps counting on the EU’s financial support to face basic challenges such as the struggle against poverty and the consolidation of its young democracy.

Thus this literature posits that there are clear causal relationships in the use <b>of</b> <b>conditionality</b> to ensure policy or institutional outcomes. Existing studies <b>of</b> enlargement <b>conditionality</b> analyse its correlation with macro-level democratization and marketization. This article, however, takes a policy-tracking approach to analyse how conditionality was actually put into operation in policy-making and institution-building in the fields of regional policy and regionalization in the CEECs. The research draws on interviews conducted with officials in the Commission and in CEEC delegations in Brussels to illustrate the views of key actors, and to examine the interactions between the Commission and the candidate countries. By studying the policy process, the article demonstrates the fluid nature <b>of</b> <b>conditionality,</b> the inconsistencies in its application by the Commission over time, and the weakness of a clear-cut causal relationship between conditionality and outcome in this policy area. By charting the changes in the Commission's approach over time, and illustrating the diverse responses of the CEECs, this study confirms the need for a more nuanced approach to the concept <b>of</b> EU <b>conditionality,</b> and argues for a logic of differentiation in the study of its impact on the CEECs.
