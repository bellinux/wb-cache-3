500|$|Wen Qiang, one of {{the most}} {{prominent}} figures implicated in the trials, had been a prominent municipal official since the days of party chiefs He Guoqiang and Wang Yang. [...] Wen, the former executive deputy commissioner of the Chongqing police force Public Security for 16 years, was tried and convicted of a litany of crimes and sentenced to death in a sensational headline-grabbing trial. Contrary to the popular perception at the time that the campaign was part of Bo's perceived penchant for self-promotion, China observer Willy Lam suggested that such a large-scale crackdown will have <b>received</b> approval from <b>central</b> <b>authorities,</b> including Hu Jintao, and that Bo became careful to not let Chongqing appear to be trying to 'set an example' for the rest of the country so he could benefit from the success politically.|$|R
50|$|A {{simple but}} {{constrained}} {{solution is to}} include a time attribute. This solution would require each message to be encrypted with a modiﬁed access tree T0, which is constructed by augmenting the original access tree T with an additional time attribute. The time attribute, ζ represents the current ‘time period’. Formally, the new access structure T0 is as follows: T0 = (T AND ζ). For example, ζ can be the ‘date’ attribute whose value changes once every day. It is assumed that each non-revoked user receives his fresh private keys corresponding to the ‘date’ attribute once everyday directly from the mobile key server MKS (which is the <b>central</b> <b>authority)</b> or via the regional delegates. With a hierarchical access structure, the key delegation property of CP-ABE can be exploited to reduce the dependency on the <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> for issuing the new private keys to all users every time interval. There are signiﬁcant trade-oﬀs between the extra load incurred by the authority for generating and communicating the new keys to the users {{and the amount of}} time that can elapse before a revoked user can be eﬀectively purged. This above solution has the following problems: a) Each user X needs to periodically <b>receive</b> from the <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> the fresh private key corresponding to the time attribute, otherwise X will not be able to decrypt any message.b) It is a lazy revocation technique the revoked user is not purged from the system until the current time period expires.c) This scheme requires an implicit time synchronization (a loose time synchronization may be suﬃcient) among the authority and the users.|$|R

40|$|Since 1923, urban local {{authorities}} in South Africa were legally obliged {{to provide housing}} to urban black workers within their areas of jurisdiction. Urban black workers were “cheap” workers, resulting in {{local authorities}} to be confronted by financial obligations and problems, which completely overwhelmed them. Therefore, many authorities neglected their housing obligations and unhygienic conditions, and slums were a common sight in urban black townships. This was detrimental {{to the health of}} black workers as well as their white co-workers. Furthermore, this situation affected the economy negatively, as well as the relationships between whites and blacks. This article investigates the housing and financial legislation urban local authorities had to comply with in order to provide urban blacks with housing; the assistance, if any, that local <b>authorities</b> <b>received</b> from the <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> (state); the financial implications if local authorities fulfilled their obligations; and the eventual profits and losses this fulfilment held for such local authorities and the black inhabitants in their municipal townships. The actions of the Port Elizabeth local authority will be discussed as a case-study: this authority managed, despite enormous financial losses, to fulfil their obligations, resulting in the realisation that more actually cost less, and that financial losses resulted in lasting social and health gains...|$|R

40|$|Strong <b>central</b> <b>authorities</b> {{are able}} to {{effectively}} manage costly defection, but are unable to adequately address lesser conflicts because of limits {{to their ability to}} monitor and enforce. We argue, counterintuitively, that these limitations build coop-eration and trust among subordinates: the limitations contribute to the production of order. First, limits to authority leave space for locally informed decentralized enforce-ment. Second, <b>central</b> <b>authorities</b> act as powerful but incompetent third parties whose threatened interventions increase incentives to cooperate and, therefore, to trust. We outline the mechanisms by which a strong <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> enforces order and test their utility by considering the secondary literature on rates of conflict in strong, weak, and capricious states. We supplement this evidence, based on association, with a close examination of diverse case studies: baseball umpires, commercial contracts, and domestic disputes. By analyzing these case studies, we isolate and describe the mechanisms by which <b>central</b> <b>authorities</b> produce order in varied settings. We find that <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> may be effective, but the majority of this effectiveness derives from an indirect influence on dyadic relations rather than direct intervention. Th...|$|R
40|$|Cross-border {{cooperation}} (CBC) {{influenced the}} regional {{development of the}} border regions. CBC is very much supported by the European Union and its funding policy. Cooperation between border regions is considered {{as a key to}} the joined Europe. Since 1989 there is a special programme supporting CBC within the member states of EU. A new programme supporting cross-border cooperation between the member states and the candidates' countries "Phare CBC" was developed in 1993. This paper is focused on selected issues of cross border cooperation of Euroregion Šumava, Pilsner region and South Bohemian region. Euroregion Šumava was established in 1993. It is a voluntary association of cities, villages and other joined organizations intent on the cross border cooperation with similar association on Bavarian and Austrian site of border. These three associations established trilateral Euroregion Šumava{ [...] }Bayericher Wald{ [...] }Mühlviertel. Together they implement the principles of European regional policy. Cross border activities of Euroregion Šumava were analyzed on followed issues: 1. Euroregion budget and its development between 1998 { [...] } 2006 2. Projects supported by Small Projects Fund realized by Euroregion 3. Projects realized under the financial support of Small Projects Fund Phare CBC and Interreg IIIA (focusing on the projects´ holders, priority areas and districts) Pilsner and South Bohemian regions were established in 2001 as regional authorities. They provide national and regional service partly financed by their own resources (mainly tax income) and partly by grants <b>received</b> from <b>central</b> <b>authorities.</b> Together they constitute the cohesion region of NUTS 2 "Southwest". Pilsner and South Bohemian regions create joint regional development policy and strategic documents because of implementing Regional operational programme. So far CBC was not part of their common regional policy. Cross border activities are analysed on the projects realised under the Interreg IIIA programme, which was managed by the Secretary of Cohesion region. Special focus is put on the projects´ holders, priority areas and regional aspects. Results of analysis are summarized in graphs, tables and maps...|$|R
