Respectively, the toss-ups are valued at $1,000, $2,000, and $3,000. In addition to these, each game has a minimum of four rounds, with more played if time permits.

5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these visual cues were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade wondered whether the simplified environment was an aesthetic choice or the result of efforts to save on development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was disappointed to see an option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise short game about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may stake out a building at a distance, the experimentation in Deus Ex Go is limited to finding the <b>right</b> <b>answer</b> rather than finding multiple routes to solve the same problem.|$|E

25|$|Planck {{cautiously}} {{insisted that}} this was simply {{an aspect of the}} processes of absorption and emission of radiation and {{had nothing to do with}} the physical reality of the radiation itself. In fact, he considered his quantum hypothesis a mathematical trick to get the <b>right</b> <b>answer</b> rather than a sizable discovery. However, in 1905 Albert Einstein interpreted Planck's quantum hypothesis realistically and used it to explain the photoelectric effect, in which shining light on certain materials can eject electrons from the material. He won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{focus on}} narrow {{debates about the}} true nature of {{mathematical}} truth, or even on practices unique to mathematicians such as the proof, a growing movement from the 1960s to the 1990s began to question the idea of seeking foundations or finding any one <b>right</b> <b>answer</b> to why mathematics works. The starting point for this was Eugene Wigner's famous 1960 paper The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences, in which he argued that the happy coincidence of mathematics and physics being so well matched seemed to be unreasonable and hard to explain.|$|E

This equation defines the EMSRa algorithm which handles the two segment case. EMSRb is smarter and handles multiple segments by comparing the revenue of the lower segment to a demand weighted average of the revenues of the higher segments. Neither of these heuristics produces the exact <b>right</b> <b>answer</b> and increasingly implementations make use of Monte Carlo simulation to find optimal protection levels.|$|E
25|$|An example: Suppose {{there is}} a library {{function}} whose purpose is to parse a single syslog file entry. What should this function do if the entry is malformed? There is no one <b>right</b> <b>answer,</b> because the same library could be deployed in programs for many different purposes. In an interactive log-file browser, {{the right thing to}} do might be to return the entry unparsed, so the user can see it—but in an automated log-summarizing program, {{the right thing to do}} might be to supply null values for the unreadable fields, but abort with an error, if too many entries have been malformed.|$|E
25|$|That is to say, the {{question}} {{can only be}} answered {{in terms of the}} broader goals of the program, which are not known to the general-purpose library function. Nonetheless, exiting with an error message is only rarely the <b>right</b> <b>answer.</b> So instead of simply exiting with an error, the function may establish restarts offering various ways to continue—for instance, to skip the log entry, to supply default or null values for the unreadable fields, to ask the user for the missing values, or to unwind the stack and abort processing with an error message. The restarts offered constitute the mechanisms available for recovering from error; the selection of restart by the condition handler supplies the policy.|$|E

It is an interactive instructional experience in which the student and the teacher are in separate physical locations. We have generated an E-learning engine or template for the teachers to enable the students to learn the lessons through incremental thinking questions chosen by the teachers in their absence. By using our software tool, interfaces will be generated automatically lesson by lesson after getting all required information from the teachers. Each question will be case (background text) based, so that the students can {{be able to get the}} <b>answers</b> <b>right</b> without being taught the topics by the teachers. The students will get feedback immediately through hints and guide to <b>right</b> <b>answers.</b> If they are unable to give the <b>right</b> <b>answers,</b> then they can get to know how to get the <b>answers</b> <b>right</b> through guide to <b>right</b> <b>answers.</b> If they give the wrong answers, then the system will give them the hints through messages for making them able to get the <b>answers</b> <b>right.</b> The students will be able to evaluate themselves through this tool after knowing their scores.

25|$|The {{argument}} of centuries of social injustice through the caste system (see below, {{in the next}} Section) is not accepted by those who {{point out that the}} caste system, although differently known and practised in different societies, is a tribal hangover from the past, which had some merit in that it ensured, or 'reserved', specified jobs to be done castes which had a preference to do so. They have no sanction in the Vedas (the Upanishads Section) in which only speak of four broad 'Varnas' or divisions according to the temperament of people and of inter-Varna switch, or mobility, based on individual efforts when he/she happens to be borne to a man of a particular Varna. This process, called 'Samskara' is, approximately, conscious individual refinement. In a true sense, therefore, the talk of deliberate subjugation of or discrimination of upper castes against lower castes has no basis, even though distortions of the principle has happened historically, without sanction of the Vedas. Hence reservation, the anti-reservationists seem to say, is just a mask for demanding reservations under the cloak of casteism over-riding merit and blissfully ignoring that Vedas do not sanction this. At any rate, after several decades of Varna reservation for the lowest social strata comprising certain classes constitutionally enshrined as 'scheduled castes' and 'scheduled tribes', and otherwise open competition to all people irrespective of any criteria other than merit and aptitude, there is no justification for the political parties to demand extend reservation of educational admission and job opportunities to more classes ('other backward castes'). It is pointed out that more opportunities in keeping with the uncontrolled growth in population, in all spheres of economic activity as well as education, will be the only <b>right</b> <b>answer</b> and not reservation. However, since proportional representation is the basis of modern democracy as it is practised, these anti-reservationists point out, this, in India, has led to its most abominable abuse, resulting in a democracy which is of and by Indians but against their own interests, since a disunited country oblivious of equality of opportunity because of prohibitive reservation levels, can never compete successfully in the global context, nor achieve much in its own management of internal economy.(Already due to politicisation of trade unions, India's labour productivity remains among the lowest in the world, as a UK study had pointed out a few years ago.) The abuse of political power to demand reservation for all other than the so-called 'forward ' communities is, according to the contesters, just a vote bank politics to woo the majority represented by the beneficiary communities to cast their votes in their favour. Since, however, there are no opponents among political parties to educational and job reservations, in view of their universal vote bank politics, such reservation in themselves cannot favour any particular parties at the elections.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the most}} {{frequent}} topics of discussion are the real-life location of Springfield, the sexuality of Waylon Smithers and [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?", a two-episode publicity stunt in which Mr. Burns was shot by an unknown character. The writers inserted many secret clues into the episode and implemented a contest in which whoever first discovered the shooter would be animated on an episode of the show. Although the alt.tv.simpsons community debated this mystery to an extreme degree, no one officially guessed the <b>right</b> <b>answer,</b> and therefore no one was ever animated on the show. Due to contest regulations, a winner had to be selected out of {{a random sample of}} entries. The sample did not contain any correct answers, so the winner who was chosen did not have the <b>right</b> <b>answer</b> and was paid a cash prize in lieu of being animated.|$|E
500|$|Groening {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} an episode in which the character Mr. Burns was shot, which {{could be used as a}} publicity stunt. The writers decided to write the episode [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" [...] in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. Part one was the final episode of the sixth season and originally aired on the Fox network on May 21, 1995. Part two was the premiere of the seventh season and originally aired on September 17, 1995. It was important for the writers to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed the obvious culprit. In the months following the broadcast of the first part, there was widespread debate among fans of the series as to who shot Mr. Burns. Fox offered a contest to tie in with the mystery where the viewers could guess who the culprit was. It ran from August 13 to September 10 and was one of the first contests to tie together elements of television and the internet. Fox launched a new website, www.Springfield.com, devoted to the mystery which got over 500,000 hits during the summer of 1995. The winner would be animated on an episode of the show. No one, however, was ever animated on the show. This was because no one officially guessed the <b>right</b> <b>answer,</b> so the chosen winner did not have the <b>right</b> <b>answer</b> and was paid a cash prize in lieu of being animated.|$|E
