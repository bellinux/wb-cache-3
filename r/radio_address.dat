5|$|In a <b>radio</b> <b>address</b> on May 11, Alley {{announced}} {{that due to}} the nullification, the military would heve {{to stay in power}} beyond June 17. He noted that his administration would require extra time to find a successor who was backed by everyone. Alley suggested that the military should retreat back to the barracks at Camp Ghezo and leave Dahomeyan politics to the career politicians. The view was unpopular, and he was outvoted by his military comrades. Alley eventually became little more than Kouandété's mouthpiece.|$|E
5|$|The {{commanding}} officer of the 5th Military District, Major General Andrija Rašeta, in overall command of the JNA intervention, told the media that his men were not protecting either side and were there only to prevent ethnic confrontations for an indeterminate period. However, the Croatian government reacted furiously to the JNA move. Tuđman's aide, Mario Nobilo, claimed that the JNA had told Croatian officials that it would engage the police {{if they did not}} leave Plitvice. In a <b>radio</b> <b>address,</b> Tuđman said that the JNA would be regarded as a hostile army of occupation if its course of action remained unchanged. On 2 April, the JNA handed the Croatian authorities an ultimatum, requesting the police leave Plitvice. The special police left Plitvice the same day, but the 90 officers staffing the newly established police station remained in place.|$|E

25|$|Herbert Hoover {{had already}} {{considered}} a bank holiday {{to prevent further}} bank runs, but rejected the idea because {{he was afraid to}} trip a panic. Roosevelt, however, gave a <b>radio</b> <b>address,</b> held in the atmosphere of a Fireside Chat, and explained to the public in simple terms the causes of the banking crisis, what the government will do and how the population could help.

25|$|Discouraged by his cabinet's hostile {{reaction}} to a British proposal to unite France and Britain to avoid defeat, and believing that his ministers no longer supported him, Reynaud resigned on 16 June. He was succeeded by Marshal of France Philippe Pétain, who delivered a <b>radio</b> <b>address</b> to the French people announcing his intention to ask for an armistice with Germany.

40|$|The {{social and}} {{political}} role of Black college presidents in the 1930 s and 1940 s via annual <b>radio</b> <b>addresses</b> is a relevant {{example of how the}} medium of the day was used as an apparatus for individual and institutional agency. The nationalist agenda of the United States federal government indirectly led to the opportunity for Black college leadership to address the rhetoric of democracy, patriotism, and unified citizenship. The research focuses on the social positioning of the <b>radio</b> <b>addresses</b> as well as their role in the advancement of Black Americans. The primary question that informs the research is whether the 1930 s and 1940 s was a period of rising consciousness for Black America. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the significance of radio during the pre- to post-war era, its parallel use by the United States federal government and historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and the interrelationship between education, politics, and society. The use of social history allows historical evidence to be viewed from the lens of identifying social trends. The social trends of the period examined include the analysis of economics, politics, and education. An additional benefit of using social history is the way in which it examines the masses and how they help shape history in conjunction with the leaders of a given period of examination. The research method also entails an in-depth analysis of 14 annual <b>radio</b> <b>addresses</b> delivered by three Black college presidents in the South during the 1930 s and 1940 s: Mordecai W. Johnson, James E. Shepard, and Benjamin E. Mays. Common themes found among <b>radio</b> <b>addresses</b> include morality and ethical behavior; economic, political, and social equality; access and inclusion in a democratic society; and a collective commitment to a just society. Black education as a form of racial uplift unveiled the meaning of access and the collective advancement of the race. Agreeing to deliver the <b>radio</b> <b>addresses</b> as a part of government-sponsored programming resulted in an inter-racial alliance between Black college leadership and the federal government. To this end, Black college leadership operationalized their access and education to benefit the needs of their race...|$|R

25|$|While the Roosevelt {{administration}} {{waited for}} the court to return its judgment, contingency plans were made for an unfavorable ruling. Ideas circulated within the White House to narrowly exercise the government's power of sovereign immunity by withdrawing {{the right to sue}} the government to enforce gold clauses. Attorney General Cummings suggested the court should be immediately packed to ensure a favorable ruling. Roosevelt himself ordered the Treasury to manipulate the market to give the impression of turmoil, although Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau refused. Roosevelt also drew up executive orders to close all stock exchanges and prepared a <b>radio</b> <b>address</b> to the public.|$|E
25|$|In {{his efforts}} to help Jews escape the tyranny of Hitler, Arlosoroff would face staunch {{opposition}} from the Revisionist ranks within his own Zionist movement. Though Mapai Labour leaders attempted to prepare the way for an agreement with Germany by mitigating anti-Nazi sentiment within Zionist circles, prominent Revisionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky steadfastly opposed them. In a radio broadcast on April 28, 1933, Jabotinsky strongly condemned any possible pact between Zionism and Hitler. Jabotinsky upheld in his <b>radio</b> <b>address</b> the Revisionist platform for an international economic boycott on German exports, suggesting in addition that the British Mandate of Palestine should assume {{the lead in the}} boycott efforts.|$|E
25|$|Several {{hundred people}} were arrested and General Mejia Víctores {{addressed}} the nation through a television and <b>radio</b> <b>address</b> in which he announced measures to address prevailing social unrest.

Students who graduated by decree in 1985 were received with brutal initiations by the different student bodies through the University.|$|E

25|$|Although not {{experiencing}} clashes {{comparable to}} those in Paris, the city was quickly paralysed. The absence of household waste collection gave the streets a foul odour, and the department was short of petrol from 22 May. Against this movement of left, the extreme right was not absent: While militants had thrown an explosive device in protest at the Communist permanence of the city on 23 December 1967, members of Occident opposed students on 21 May, {{in front of the}} Picardy cinema. During the night of 27–28 May, students tried to take the House of Culture. In the aftermath of President Charles de Gaulle's <b>radio</b> <b>address,</b> his supporters in Amiens demonstrated in the streets on 31 May, while recovery was committed the following week. Faure law promulgated, the University of Amiens was created on 26 October, founded on a campus in the southwestern suburbs of the city.|$|E
25|$|By January 1944, {{the front}} was pushed {{back by the}} Soviet Army almost {{all the way to}} the former Estonian border. Narva was evacuated. Jüri Uluots, the last {{legitimate}} prime minister of the Republic of Estonia (according to the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia) prior to its fall to the Soviet Union in 1940, delivered a <b>radio</b> <b>address</b> that implored all able-bodied men born from 1904 through 1923 to report for military service. (Before this, Uluots had opposed Estonian mobilization.) The call drew support from all across the country: 38,000 volunteers jammed registration centers. Several thousand Estonians who had joined the Finnish army came back across the Gulf of Finland to join the newly formed Territorial Defense Force, assigned to defend Estonia against the Soviet advance. It was hoped that by engaging in such a war Estonia would be able to attract Western support for the cause of Estonia's independence from the USSR and thus ultimately succeed in achieving independence.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle {{landed at}} Heston Airport soon after 12.30pm on 17 June. He visited Churchill at 10 Downing Street at around 3pm and {{discussed}} making a radio broadcast, {{although it was}} agreed to postpone such a speech until after Pétain's imminent broadcast had been made. Pétain’s broadcast later that day stated openly that “the fighting must end” {{and that he had}} approached the Germans for terms; that evening de Gaulle dined with Jean Monnet and denounced Pétain’s “treason”. The next day the British Cabinet (Churchill was not present, as it was the day of his “Finest Hour” speech) were reluctant to agree to de Gaulle giving a <b>radio</b> <b>address</b> via the BBC Radio service, as Britain was still interceding with the Pétain government about the fate of the French fleet. Contrary to de Gaulle’s later claims, several eyewitnesses agree that Duff Cooper (Minister of Information) had an advance copy of the text, to which there were no objections. The Cabinet eventually agreed after individual lobbying, as indicated by a handwritten amendment to the Cabinet minutes.|$|E
