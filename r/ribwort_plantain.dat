50|$|This yellow-footed {{tortoise}} eats {{many kinds}} of foliage. They are too slow to capture any fast animals. In the wild, their diets consist of grasses, fallen fruit, carrion, plants, bones, mushrooms, excrement, and slow-moving invertebrates such as snails, worms, and others {{they are able to}} capture. In captivity, they are fed oranges, apples, melons, endive, collard greens, dandelions, <b>plantain,</b> <b>ribwort,</b> clover, shredded carrots, insects, worms, cuttlebone, tortoise vitamins, edible flowers, and alfalfa pellets. Each yellow-footed tortoise in the wild reaches the age of maturity at about 8-10 years. The fecundity of a female generally depends on her size; the bigger they are, the more eggs they can produce. On average, a female will create about six to 16 eggs per year, although some female individuals may not reproduce each year. The eggs have brittle shells and are elongated to spherical, about 3-6 cm in diameter. The egg size will increase with the body size of the tortoise. The young are self-sufficient from birth. The yellow-footed tortoise can live around 50-60 years.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Lancelot <b>Plantain</b> (<b>Ribwort,</b> narrow-leaf or English plantain) is a deep-rooted, {{short-lived}} perennial herb from Plantaginaceae family {{which has}} been used for various medicinal purposes for centuries, especially in Europe and only more recently has been proposed as a forage plant. The leaf of plantain is highly palatable for grazing animals, providing mineral-rich forage. Recently two productive upright cultivars of plantain have been bred and introduced, Grasslands Lancelot and the more erect winter active Ceres Tonic. Plantain grows moderately in winter but its main growth periods beings in spring and autumn with opportunistic summer growth. Although it reveals suitable winter survival in natural conditions, but there is not a lot of information about cold tolerance of this plant. So {{it is important to recognize}} the freeze tolerance of narrow leaf plantain for successful planting and utilization in cold regions such as Mashhad in Khorasan Razavi Province (Northeast of Iran). Determining LT 50 point or critical temperature for survival of plant is the most reliable and simple method for evaluating cold tolerance of plants.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} improving seedling emergence, stand establishment and yield of late sown <b>ribwort</b> <b>plantain</b> (Plantago lanceolata) by seed priming pot and field experiments were conducted at the Islamic Azad University, Tabriz, Iran during 2013. The <b>ribwort</b> <b>plantain</b> seeds were differently treated by ultrasonication, laser, magnetic field, gamma and beta irradiations all for 3. 5 and 5 min. and were sown on 5 th and 20 th of May. All of the seed priming treatments reduced seedling emergence time, 50 % of seedling emergence and mean emergence time as compared with control. Highest seedling dry weight (0. 49 g. plant- 1) resulted from magnetic field treatment for 5 min. followed by magnetic field for 3. 5 min. and ultrasonic treatments (0. 40 g. plant- 1). A further reduction in exposure time of magnetic field from 5 to 3. 5 min. decreased seedling vigor index. When seeds were sown in 5 th and 20 th May, maturity period of plots treated with magnetic field and ultrasonic happened to range between 112. 2 and 99. 7 days after sowing, respectively. Leaf area index remained statistically unaffected due to a delay of 15 days in sowing date. Under field conditions, there was not significant difference between seed yields from sowing dates, and the yield ranged from 176 kg. ha- 1 in control, gamma and beta irradiations up to 211 kg. ha- 1 in magnetic field and ultrasonic treatments.

40|$|V prvem delu raziskave je bil namen ugotoviti sestavo zeli in njihovo neto energijsko vrednost za laktacijo (NEL) glede na staranje. Na trajnem nižinskem travinju v Blatni Brezovici in Murskih Črncih smo zbrali vzorce sedmih vrst zeli: navadni rman (Achillea millefolium L.), ozkolistni trpotec (Plantago lanceolata L), navadna lakota (Gallium mollugo L.), plazeča zlatica (Ranunculus repens L.), gomoljasta zlatica (Ranunculus bulbosus L), navadni regrat (Taraxacum officinale F. Weber) in topolistna kislica (Rumex obtusifolus L.). Ugotovili smo, da pufrska sposobnost pri navadnem rmanu in ozkolistnem trpotcu narašča s staranjem rastlin ob vseh treh oziroma štirih košnjah. Vsebnost vodotopnih ogljikovih hidratov (VOH) se je ob prvi košnji najmanj spreminjala pri navadnem rmanu (+ 12 g VOH kg- 1 suhe snovi (SS) dnevno v Murskih Črncih) in ozkolistnem trpotcu (– 0, 11 g kg- 1 SS dnevno v Murskih Črncih). Največje zmanjševanje VOH s staranjem smo ugotovili pri topolistni kislici (– 3, 40 g VOH kg- 1 SS dnevno). Vsebnost surovih maščob (SM) se je ob prvi košnji najhitreje zmanjševala pri navadnem regratu (– 0, 54 oziroma – 0, 75 g SM kg- 1 SS dnevno). Najmanj surovih beljakovin (SB) smo ugotovili v rastlinah iz družine zlatičnic (88 do 162 g SB kg- 1 SS). Surova vlaknina (SVl) je najhitreje naraščala pri gomoljasti zlatici (4, 31 g SVl kg- 1 SS dnevno), najpočasneje pa pri navadnem regratu (0, 29 oziroma 0, 50 g SVl kg- 1 SS dnevno). Največjo vsebnost NEL ob prvi košnji smo določili v plazeči zlatici (6, 73 – 7, 38 MJ NEL kg- 1 SS), najmanjšo maja pri navadnem rmanu (4, 36 – 6, 29 MJ NEL kg- 1 SS) in topolistni kislici (4, 50 – 5, 41 MJ NEL kg- 1 SS). Vsebnost NEL se je najhitreje zmanjševala pri navadnem rmanu in gomoljasti zlatici (– 0, 05 MJ NEL kg- 1 SS dnevno), najpočasneje pa pri ozkolistnem trpotcu in plazeči zlatici (– 0, 01 MJ NEL kg- 1 SS dnevno). V drugem delu raziskave nas je zanimala silirna sposobnost navadnega rmana in ozkolistnega trpotca v primerjavi z mnogocvetno ljuljko (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) in travniško bilnico (Festuca pratensis L.), pa tudi vpliv 10 in 30 % deleža omenjenih zeli v mešanici na kakovost fermentacije omenjenih silaž. Hkrati smo proučevali vpliv venenja na kakovost fermentacije in na vsebnost β-karotena v silažah. S podaljševanjem časa venenja in omejeno fermentacijo se je pH-vrednost zelo uvelih silaž razen mnogocvetne ljuljke zmanjšala manj kakor pH-vrednost neuvelih ali uvelih silaž (p < 0, 05). Neuvele in uvele silaže mnogocvetne ljuljke so bile slabše kakovosti od silaž travniške bilnice, navadnega rmana, ozkolistnega trpotca ali mešanice travniške bilnice z 10 - ali 30 -odstotnim deležem zeli. Povezave med vsebnostjo β-karotena in drugimi produkti fermentacije so razen povezave s pH-vrednostjo in BK šibke, vendar statistično značilne (p < 0, 05). Ugotavljamo, da rastlinska vrsta in venenje (p < 0, 001), pa tudi njun interakcija (p < 0, 01) vplivajo na vsebnost β-karotena v silaži. Mnogocvetna ljuljka in travniška bilnica vsebujeta v sveži snovi in tudi v silažah več β-karotena v primerjavi z ozkolistnim trpotcem ali navadnim rmanom. Največje izgube β-karotena smo ugotovili v zelo uvelih silažah navadnega rmana (– 56, 7 %) in ozkolistnega trpotca (51, 1 %), precej manjše pa v silaži mnogocvetne ljuljke (48, 4 %) in travniške bilnice (37, 0 %). Primerjava izgub β-karotena med venenjem in siliranjem trav in zeli kaže, da so izgube med venenjem večje kakor med siliranjem.

On a permanent lowland grasslands in Blatna Brezovica and Murski Črnci we have collected seven forb species: common yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.), <b>ribwort</b> <b>plantain</b> (Plantago lanceolata L), Italian ryegrass (Gallium mollugo L.), creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens L.), bulbous buttercup (Ranunculus bulbosus L), common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale F. Weber) and broad leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolus L.). The results show, that the buffering capacity (BK) in common yarrow and <b>ribwort</b> <b>plantain</b> increased with the aging of plants during all harvests. The concentration of water soluble carbohydrates (VOH) at the first cut changed the least in common yarrow (+ 12 g VOH kg- 1 of dry matter (DM) per day in Murski Črnci) and <b>ribwort</b> <b>plantain</b> (- 0. 11 g VOH kg- 1 of DM per day in Murski Črnci). The largest reduction of VOH with aging was found in broad leaved dock (- 3. 40 g VOH kg- 1 of DM per day). Crude fat (SM) content at the first cut declined the most rapidly in common dandelion (- 0. 54 and - 0. 75 g SM kg- 1 of DM per day). A minimum crude protein (CP) content was found in plants from the buttercup family (88 to 162 g SB kg- 1 of DM). Crude fiber (CF) content has increased the most rapidly in the bulbous buttercup (4. 31 g CF kg- 1 of DM per day) and the slowest in the common dandelion (0. 29 and 0. 50 g CF kg- 1 of DM per day). The highest content of NEL at the first cut was determined in creeping buttercup (6. 73 to 7. 38 MJ NEL kg- 1 of DM), while the lowest content of NEL was found in common yarrow (4. 36 – 6, 29 MJ NEL kg- 1 of DM) and broad leaved dock (4. 50 – 5, 41 MJ NEL kg- 1 of DM). The NEL value declined the fastest in common yarrow and bulbous buttercup (- 0. 05 MJ NEL kg- 1 of DM per day, respectively) and the slowest in <b>ribwort</b> <b>plantain</b> and creeping buttercup (- 0. 01 MJ NEL kg- 1 DM per day). In the second experiment we have studied the ensiling capacity and the quality of silages from common yarrow and <b>ribwort</b> <b>plantain</b> in comparison to Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis L.), as well as the influence of 10 and 30 % addition of the above mentioned herbs on the quality of the silage fermentation. We also studied the influence of wilting on the fermentation quality and the content of β-carotene in silages. With increasing time of wilting and reduced fermentation activity, the pH value in highly-wilted silages, with the exception of Italian ryegrass, decreased to a lesser extent than the pH value in un-wilted or wilted silages (P< 0. 05). The un-wilted and wilted silages of Italian ryegrass were of lower quality than silages made of meadow fescue, common yarrow, <b>ribwort</b> <b>plantain</b> or silages from a mixture of meadow fescue with addition of 10 or 30 % of forbs. The correlations between the content of β-carotene and other fermentation products, with the exception of the correlation of pH value with the BK, were relatively weak but statistically significant (P < 0. 05). We have noted that the plant species and wilting (P < 0. 001), as well as their interaction (P < 0. 01), influenced the content of β-carotene in the silage. Italian ryegrass and meadow fescue contained more β-carotene in the fresh material as well as in silages, in comparison to the <b>ribwort</b> <b>plantain</b> and common yarrow. The largest loss of β-carotene was observed in a highly-wilted silages of common yarrow (- 56. 7 %) and <b>ribwort</b> <b>plantain</b> (- 51. 1 %), whereas the losses were considerably lower in the silage of Italian ryegrass (- 48. 4 %) and meadow fescue (- 37. 0 %). Comparison of losses of β-carotene as a consequence of wilting and ensiling of grasses and herbs shows, that the loss of β-carotene due to wilting is greater than the one caused by ensiling. The results show that, with the exception of meadow fescue, the β-carotene losses are largest during the first 24 hours of wilting...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the studies}} carried out in 2012 - 2013 was to {{evaluate}} the influence of plant density (sowing rate) on the growth, development, and accumulation of biologically active compounds in the leaves of plants representing three populations of <b>ribwort</b> <b>plantain</b> (Plantago lanceolata L.). The experiment {{was established in the}} third decade of April. Seeds were sown at the rate of 3 and 6 kg/ha. Plants were harvested at three stages of development: vegetative growth, blooming, and seed maturity. Plant weight, root length, leaf length and width, number and length of seed stalks were determined. In the air-dry leaves the content of iridoid glycosides, tannins, flavonoids, and phenolic acids were determined. Sowing rate did not significantly affect the yield of leaves. Plants growing at higher density were characterised by higher content of biologically active compounds. Key words: cultivation, populations, sowing rate, time of harvest, morphological traits, iridoid glycosides, tannins, flavonoids, phenolic acids 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{few studies}} {{in the past have}} shown that plant {{diversity}} in terms of species richness and functional composition can modify plant defense chemistry. However, it is not yet clear to what extent genetic differentiation of plant chemotypes or phenotypic plasticity in response to diversity-induced variation in growth conditions or a combination of both is responsible for this pattern. We collected seed families of <b>ribwort</b> <b>plantain</b> (Plantago lanceolata) from six-year old experimental grasslands of varying plant diversity (Jena Experiment). The off-spring of these seed families was grown under standardized conditions with two levels of light and nutrients. The iridoid glycosides, catalpol and aucubin, and verbascoside, a caf-feoyl phenylethanoid glycoside, were measured in roots and shoots. Although offspring of different seed families differed in the tissue concentrations of defensive metabolites, plant diversity in the mothers ' environment did not explain the variation in the measured defensive metabolites of P. lanceolata offspring. However secondary metabolite levels in roots and shoots were strongly affected by light and nutrient availability. Highest concentrations of iri-doid glycosides and verbascoside were found under high light conditions, and nutrient avail...|$|E
40|$|The {{amino acid}} proline {{is known to}} {{accumulate}} in the tissues of several plant species {{as a result of}} environmental stress. High concentrations of certain toxic metals are one form of stress that can induce proline accumulation, and in some cases praline accumulation is considered to be an adaptive response to toxic metals by tolerant ecotypes. The proline accumulation responses of Plantago lanceolata (<b>Ribwort</b> <b>plantain)</b> were assessed in individuals taken from lead tolerant and non-tolerant populations when these plants were stressed with applications of lead nitrate solutions. Results suggested that {{there was no significant difference}} between the proline levels that had accumulated in the leaves and roots of plants taken from both populations, although proline levels in control plants were significantly lower than in lead stressed plants. Fieldwork, investigating the possibility of a proline gradient along roadside verges as a response to the graduated deposition of lead from motor vehicle exhaust fumes, failed to reveal any significant correlations. The effects of water stress during a dry summer period were thought to be more important at the time the investigation was made...|$|E
