40|$|Multiple site damage (MSD) {{is a type}} of {{cracking}} {{that may}} be found in aging airplanes which can adversely affect the damage tolerance of an airframe structure. In this paper the behavior of MSD is studied by examining the interaction of cracks in stiffened and riveted panels. The hybrid finite element method, in conjunction with the complex variable theory of elasticity, is used to provide accurate and efficient solutions to these problems. Typical results include stress intensity factors at the crack tips, stress concentration factors in the stiffeners, and <b>rivet</b> <b>loads</b> for a stiffened structure with multiple cracks.

Optimal chip flow and tool life {{are often in}} competition with burr formation, general hole quality and cycle time. Physics-based modeling of drilling processes can provide insight and information not readily available or easily obtained from experiments, and in a much faster time frame. A three-dimensional finite element-based model of drilling is presented which includes fully adaptive unstructured meshing, tight thermo-mechanical coupling, deformable tool-chip-workpiece contact, interfacial heat transfer across the tool-chip boundary, and constitutive models appropriate for high strain-rate, large strain and high temperature deformation. Explicit modeling of entrance, steady-state and exit modeling of aluminum and titanium materials, as well as metal stack-ups is performed. Drilling through stack-up layers is also shown. The modeling includes both solid twist and indexable drills. Metal cutting tests are performed and comparison with predicted data is provided. ...|$|R

40|$|Fractographic {{observations}} on fatigue tested 2024 T 3 clad aluminium riveted lap-splice joints indicate oblique fronts {{after the initial}} surface or corner crack at a rivet hole has penetrated through the sheet thichness. No stress intensity factor solutions are available for this geometry subjected to remote biaxial tension, remote bending, <b>rivet</b> <b>loading,</b> and <b>rivet</b> interference, which are typical for a pressurized fuselage of a transport aircraft. However, comparisons are made with solutions from the literature for remote tension and bending. To reduce model generation time for each crack geometry, one finite element mesh is used to generate a model for each crack geometry for which a stress intensity factor solution is desired. In using this procedure, the original orthogonal mesh, a mesh where all of the crack plane elements are orthogonal to one another, is modified to accommodate the new crack geometries; therefore, maintaining an orthogonal crack-front mesh is not possible. The validity of the three dimensional Virtual Crack Closure Technique, 30 VCCT, with non orthogonal finite element meshes for calculating mode I stress intensity factors is assessed. Comparisons are made to existing two and three dimensional stress intensity factor solutions obtained using conformal mapping, boundary collocation, and finite element analysis. Given a sufficiently fine mess, the 30 VCCT result is practically invariant to mesh pattern. Using the 30 VCCT with a non orthogonal mesh, a cursory sensitivity study is accomplished to asses {{the effect of the}} crack profile of a through crack on the stress intensity factor. If a through crack with an oblique elliptical shape is approximated as a straight crack, the stress intensity factors are nearly the same for remote tension but not for remote bending.

40|$|Riveted lap joints {{are being}} used {{traditionally}} for long in the aerospace industry. These joints are the crucial zones that are designed under damage tolerance procedures in the civil aircraft industry. Conventional design procedures of riveted lap joints {{are based on the}} assumption that all <b>rivets</b> carry equal <b>load.</b> As this assumption is not entirely valid as found in research literature associated with fatigue and fracture, it is important to investigate this point in terms of the static strength of the riveted joint as well. Hence, in the present study, riveted joint’s static strength experiments and numerical studies are carried out on four different (single and multi-row) riveted lap joints with strain gauges placed at specified locations. The experiments show that all the riveted lap joints sustained the estimated ultimate load and failed only after reaching or exceeding the joint failure <b>load.</b> All these <b>riveted</b> lap joints are analyzed by non-linear finite element method, considering the rivet yielding, plate yielding, geometrical nonlinear and secondary bending effects of the lap joint. The analysis of riveted lap joints shows that though there is unequal load distribution among the rivets in the elastic regime, once the rivets start yielding, significant redistribution of the load takes place among the <b>rivets</b> and the <b>load</b> sharing between the rivets is nearly equal at the failure load of the joint. The agreement between the finite element analysis strains and experimental strains is reasonably good at the failure load and this in conjunction with the aforementioned experimental finding proves that the rivets share nearly equal load at the joint failure load and justifies the conventional design methodology of riveted joints. To the authors’ knowledge no previous research evidence for such correlation was found and this paper confirms conventional design procedures are adequate, though complex interactions between the plate and rivets tend to exist based on non-linear behavior. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper derives a closed-form {{solution}} for the stress distributions in an infinite plane <b>loaded</b> by a <b>rivet</b> of a different material under either plane stress or plane strain condition. A distinctive feature of the present analysis is that the <b>rivet</b> <b>load</b> is modelled by distributed body forces over {{the section of the}} rivet, in contrast to the commonly-used assumption of a concentrated load acting at the centre of the rivet. Two body force potentials are introduced to model the cases of conservative, uniform distributed force (Loading Case I) and non-conservative, non-uniform distributed force (Loading Case II), which is similar to those caused by shear force on a circular section. Our results show that the normal contact stress decreases with both the stiffness ratio ζ = μ 2 /μ 1 (μ 1 and μ 2 are the shear moduli for the plane and rivet, respectively) and the frictional coefficient μ between the plane and rivet; conversely, the shear contact stress increases with both μ and ζ. The normal contact stress for Loading Case I is larger than that for Loading Case II, while the opposite conclusion applies to the shear contact stress; their differences are more apparent for larger ζ. Larger values of ζ and μ result in higher maximum hoop stress and the corresponding location of maximum hoop stress deviates farther from the edge of contact zone; and the maximum hoop stress resulted from Loading Case II is larger than that induced by Loading Case I. The hoop stress at the rivet hole agrees well with experimental results by Coker and Filon [Coker, E. G. and Filon, L. N. G. (1931).

The specimens corresponding to the load deformation curves were comprised of 18 machine countersunk joints, 12 double dimple joints and four sub-countersunk joints. Within each type of joints the specimen varied in series of sheet material and thickness, rivet material and rivet size. It is shown that yield load, defined as load giving four percent of rivet diameter joint set, is dependent on d/t ratios, the yield load lowering at increasing d/t values. Also, there are indications that as softer rivet material is used with a given sheet material, the increasing d/t ratios have less adverse effects. There could be made no particular correlation of yield load as defined by load at. 005 " set with any of the varying parameters. In the case of the double dimple and sub-countersunk joints, no particular conclusions could be reached as the test data was confined to a small range of d/t values. It was concluded from the countersunk rivet data that permanent set based on rivet diameter is a more reasonable yield criterion than permanent set based on an arbitrary constant. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this paper, a new {{analytical}} method for solving stable crack propagation {{problems in a}} ductile panel with a row of cracks, is presented. The main {{purpose of the present}} study is to estimate the maximum load carrying capacity of such panels accurately. The so called Elastic Plastic Finite Element Alternating Method (Pyo et al. (1994)) was extended to account for the propagating cracks. The crack propagation algorithm utilizes the analytic rack solution to release the stresses ahead the crack tip. The T ~ integral is employed as the crack extension criterion. This integral parameter accounts for the near tip stress-strain singularity and its critical values for crack propagation can be extracted from the P-Aa curve of single cracked specimen case. The present method can be applied to the problems of the fuselage skin of aging airplanes, in which a row of cracks develop (MSD; Multiple Site Damage) from <b>rivet</b> holes. The <b>load</b> carrying capacity of such damaged structure reduces by a considerable amount. In order to predict the behavior near the critical oad, one must account for plastic deformation, if the material is ductile. Furthermore, the maximum load carried by the structure is often reached after some amount of crack propagation. In this paper, a series of analyses have been conducted and their results compare with the available xperimental data. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of the self-piercing riveting (SPR) technology {{in recent years has}} broadened the application of the technology in the automobile industry. However, the SPR process currently utilises high-strength steel rivets; and the combination between steel rivets with an aluminium car body makes recycling a challenge. The possibility of replacing a steel self-piercing rivet with an aluminium one has thus been raised as an interesting topic. Within this framework, the objective of the present paper is to provide an experimental database on the riveting process using an aluminium self-piercing rivet. An experimental programme has been carried out, where two similar sheets in aluminium alloy 6060 in three different tempers (temper W, temper T 4, and temper T 6) have been joined by using a self-piercing rivet in three different alloys, i. e. 6082 -T 6, 7108 -T 5, and 7278 -T 6. The influence of the die shape on the SPR of aluminium sheets using aluminium rivets was also considered. Conventional rivets and dies according to the Boellhoff standards were employed. The test results were exploited in terms of the riveting force–displacement curves and cross-sectional geometries of the riveted joints. The test data were also used to validate a 2 D-axisymmetric model, which was originally developed at SIMLab for modelling the riveting process using a steel rivet. Finally, the mechanical behaviour of a riveted connection using an aluminium <b>rivet</b> under quasi-static <b>loading</b> conditions (i. e. combined pure shear and pure opening loads) was experimentally studied and compared with corresponding tests using a steel rivet in terms of force–displacement curves...|$|R
40|$|Hot-driven rivets were {{extensively}} used in {{iron and}} steel structures in the past. Nowadays, these constructions represent {{an important part of}} the architectural and cultural heritage that needs to be preserved and protected. The majority of historic steel structures is still in service and is exposed to loads larger than expected. The reliability of these structures is also affected by deterioration and the poor quality of material (Sustainable bridges 2006). After several decades from their erection, this class of constructions reveals some damages and/or structural inadequacies (Guerrieri et al. 2005). These types of constructions are generally characterized by trussed structural schemes. Hence, the failure of connections can produce the overall failure of the structure, because the riveted connections represent the weaker elements of these structures. These considerations lead to identify the vulnerability of connections as the crucial aspect concerning the structural capacity of ancient metal structures. Hence, the present work is devoted to investigate the structural capacity of lapped <b>riveted</b> connections <b>loaded</b> in shear typically adopted in aged metal structures still in service. The aim is the development of a valid methodology of prevision of the existing riveted connections behaviour. After a preliminary study on the technology of riveted connections and the rivet forming process, and in particular on the effects of hot driven process on the overall behaviour, a review of the actual codes prescriptions is reported, highlighting the approximations in the prescribed verifications and providing to a description of the local phenomena that characterizes the connection behaviour. An overview on the prior research on riveted connections is also presented, in which the experimental studies and the numerical simulations proposed and studied up to today are discussed and described. The literature experimental and numerical studies on riveted connections need to be extended to different materials, geometries and configurations, due to the sensitivity of the connection response to the manufacturing process (Hechtman, 1948; Schenker et al., 1954, Munse, 1970). To this end, a large experimental investigation carried out within the framework of the European project PROHITECH. A detailed description of this campaign is reported: after a detailed illustration of the set-up of experimental tests and of the monitored parameters, the results are presented and discussed. On the basis of a careful revision of results, in the final part of the chapter a theoretical formulation on the failure verifications of these connections is proposed, by revising the EN 1993 1 - 8 2005 formula. On the basis of the experimental results, a highly detailed riveted connections F. E. model is proposed. The geometries and the mechanical characteristics are described, and contact interactions are illustrated. The element type and the mesh sizing are highlighted, and the rivet clamping model is described. The calibration of the F. E. model is also illustrated. At last, the numerical results are reported and discussed. The work ends with a comparison between numerical and proposed theoretical results to verify the reliability of the theoretical equations and F. E. results. In this manner, a useful tool to predict the behaviour of all types of riveted connections is provided. To this end, the magnitude of numerical results was compared with the proposed theoretical formulas, to ensure both the good accuracy of F. E. model and the reliability of the proposed equations. At last, the main conclusions of the work, together with possible further developments for future research, are illustrated...|$|R
