Invitations to Drosso's were restricted to a few regulars and occasional friends. The Drosso's apartment had been converted to an opium den, subdivided into small rooms filled with low couches and decorations befitting an Arabic setting. After that introduction, Harry dropped in at Drosso’s frequently and sometimes stayed {{away from home for}} days at a time.|$|E

Tyutcheva said the children had been taught not to discuss Rasputin with her and were careful to hide his visits from the nursery staff.

The woman refuses to leave her house and her books, choosing instead to light a match and burn herself alive. Montag returns home jarred by the woman's suicide. While getting <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>bed,</b> he hides the stolen book under his pillow. Still shaken by the night's events, he attempts to make conversation with Mildred, starting by asking her {{when they first met}} and where. Mildred goes to answer, but immediately forgets. As she laughs off her ignorance and heads for the bathroom to take more sleeping pills, Montag realizes just how much Mildred's sleeping pill addiction, love of interactive entertainment, and fast driving has ruined her mind and their marriage. Later, as Mildred is sleeping, Montag wakes her up and asks her if she has seen or heard anything about Clarisse McClellan. Mildred initially brushes off the question until she finally reveals what happened: Clarisse's family moved away after Clarisse got hit by a speeding car and died four days ago. Dismayed by her failure to mention this earlier, Montag uneasily tries to fall asleep. Outside he suspects the presence of [...] "The Hound", an eight-legged robotic dog-like creature that resides in the firehouse and aids the firemen.|$|E

But our friend Diogenes {{was not a}} man to be perturbed either by admiring or condemning looks.

50|$|Lost in the wilderness, Bu laments {{that he has}} no {{home since}} he is neither a troll nor a human ("I'm So All Alone"); he finds shelter by a tree and falls asleep. Meanwhile, the murderous trolls are chased back up the {{mountain}} by a fox, the Troll Bridge crumbling behind them and trapping them in the Troll Kingdom. As they flee, they are watched warily by a gnome named Bjørn (voiced by William Christopher) and his wife (voiced by B.J. Ward). Discovering Bu at the base of their treehouse, Bjørn ventures down to see if he is another troll, but proclaims that he must be a traveling gnome. As Bu protests, he catches his reflection in a slab of ice and sees that he is no longer trollish. Bjørn asks Bu to stay in the valley to help out the other gnomes with their work. After Bu learns that he is in the village where Kristi and Sonja live, Bjørn takes him to their cottage. Back in the present, Bu <b>readies</b> himself <b>for</b> <b>bed.</b> He explains that while his story may sound like a fairy tale, the story of Jesus is not. He falls asleep as the Star of Bethlehem shines outside.|$|R

40|$|In 2015, {{there were}} {{approximately}} 17, 000 General Medicine admissions in the Department of Medicine (DOM) at MGH. General Medicine patients regularly experience significant non-clinical delays caused by bed and care team unavailability, with approximately 25 % of patients waiting ten {{hours or more}} <b>for</b> a <b>bed.</b> Delays in bed and care team assignments result in decreased patient satisfaction, congestion in the ED and ICUs, and increased overall hospital length-of-stay. This project studies General Medicine patient flow, develops and evaluates interventions to improve this flow, and provides recommendations to hospital leadership. To this end, we construct a discrete-event simulation based on historical data. Intervention effectiveness is measured primarily based on patient-wait-for-bed, the time from when patient is medically <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> an inpatient <b>bed</b> until the bed is assigned to and <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> the patient. We find that the simulation model accurately represents the wait times of General Medicine patients. We propose a new algorithm, which when implemented could reduce overall average patient-wait-for-bed by 9 % from 7. 36 to 6. 67 hours. Implementation of additional capacity and reorganization of the physician care teams (known as the DOM redesign) is shown {{to result in a}} further 31 % reduction in average wait time (from 6. 67 to 4. 59 hours). Other interventions tested such as early assignment of patients to care teams based on predicted discharges, and increased flexibility of care teams to cover different units are shown to have modest effects on overall patient-wait-for-bed. by Elizabeth Ugarph.
