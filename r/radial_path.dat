30|$|This {{time delay}} (excluding dl) is only due to {{relativistic}} effects, assuming the <b>radial</b> <b>paths</b> {{are the same}} and neglecting all the possible additional effects changing the total path length. These effects are carefully discussed in the paper, and either compensated for in transit or {{taken into account in}} post-processing. Among these effects, the one mentioned at the end of Section  3.3 deserves more attention: we know that the radial motion of the satellite gives a contribution to the time delay. Indeed, the <b>radial</b> <b>paths</b> cannot be the same due to the satellite displacement during the time spent by the photon in the satellite fibre loop. In Section  3.3 we suggest how to compute this additional delay, but only at a classical level. Since we are interested in the relativistic time delay, we must take into account also the relativistic corrections related to this path change. For example, following two different <b>radial</b> <b>paths,</b> two photons would cross two different gravitational fields, being affected by a different Shapiro delay. However, the relativistic corrections related to the difference in the <b>radial</b> <b>paths,</b> are orders of magnitude smaller than the time delay in Eq. (14) and so can be safely neglected.|$|R

5000|$|Specific to {{the term}} coined in {{internal}} combustion engine valve train technology, for automotive, marine, motorcycle and truck engines, where it is being referenced to in this definition, and as set forth originally in the explicative surrounding the Miller mid-lift Patent, #4,365,785 issued to Jim Miller in December 1982, regarding rocker arm geometry: over-arcing (adjective and verb) relates to the <b>radial</b> <b>path</b> which either end of a rocker arm makes as it follows the inherent arc created from a pre-specified distance of measurement from its pivotal axis (the radius), whereby a connection and/or contact is made with respective components: push-rod and valve, both of which operating under linear (in-line) definitions of motion. Although a specific [...] "radius" [...] is designed by this radial length, and {{could be argued that}} it is [...] "only" [...] an arc, not truly parabolic (as it is not), the effect of its motion when measured to a linear reference that is fixed, {{as it relates to the}} stopping and starting points of this arc, is extremely important to the translation of this radial information, to or from the linear components of which the arc's tangent points attach.|$|E
5000|$|... "Over-arcing" [...] in this definition's context {{relates to}} one of two variables, {{dictated}} by which of two halves the rocker arm's pivotal axis resides in relation to the ensuing motion. In the strict definition, over-arcing pertains to the pivotal axis residing too low with regard to its starting point of motion, in providing a 90 degree relationship at exactly the mid-lift point of motion; whereby 90 degrees is reached (if ever) at some point AFTER the exact half way point of motion (mid-lift) occurs. In the opposite example to this definition, the rocker arm's pivotal axis sits too high with regard to the starting point (valve tip) of motion, thus effecting a sweep of its <b>radial</b> <b>path</b> that dominates beneath itself, whereby the 90 degree relationship of the linear component's axis (valve and push-rod, respectively) to the tangent points to the rocker arm's pivotal axis is acquired BEFORE the mid-lift point of movement is attained. In this example, the term used is under-arcing. As with over-arcing, the result in wasted motion is the same, but the consequences to the ever changing velocity delivered to the valve, which is dictated by where this 90 degree tangent point occurs, is opposite (in both symptoms and effect) to the phenomena of its counterpart. Although both terms are simple in principle, their consequences to the efficient design and implementation of high performance push-rod driven (and otherwise) valve trains is decisive.|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{framework for}} the description of structureless clay behaviour is proposed in this paper. It {{is based on the}} observation that there exists a biunique relationship between the <b>radial</b> stress <b>path</b> direction and the compression curve on the specific volume (v = 1 + e) -mean effective stress (σ or p) plane. The projection on the v - σ plane defines the Intrinsic Compression Curve (ICC) of the corresponding <b>radial</b> stress <b>path,</b> which results in infinite possible ICC curves. Following a normalization procedure, a general methodology is presented, which can be applied to any mathematical formulation of the ICC curve.

40|$|Achievement {{of complex}} shapes with high {{dimensional}} {{accuracy and precision}} by forming process is a demanding challenge for scientists and practitioners. Available technologies are numerous, with laser forming being progressively emerging because of limited springback, lack of molds and sophisticated auxiliary equipments. However, laser forming finds limited applications, especially when forming of tridimensional (3 d) complex shapes is required. In this case, cost savings are often counterbalanced by the need for troublesome forming strategies. Therefore, traditional alternatives based on mechanical devices are usually preferred to laser systems.
