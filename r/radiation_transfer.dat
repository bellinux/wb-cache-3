2500|$|The {{secondary}} assembly was {{the actual}} SHRIMP {{component of the}} weapon. The weapon, like most contemporary weapons at that time, bore the same code-name as the secondary. The secondary was situated in the cylindrical end of the device, where its end was locked to the radiation case by a type of mortise and tenon joint. The hohlraum at its cylindrical end had an internal projection, which nested the secondary and had better structural strength to support the secondary's assembly, which had most of the device's mass. A visualisation to {{this is that the}} joint looked much like a cap (the secondary) fitted in a cone (the projection of the radiation case). Any other supporting structure would cause <b>radiation</b> <b>transfer</b> blockade and complex vibrational behavior. With this form of joint, the secondary and the hohlraum behaved as a single mass sharing common eigenvalues (eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes). The other end of the radiation case was shaped like a parabola to focus the radiation emitted by the fission device. The secondary assembly was an elongated truncated cone. From its front part to its aft section it was steeply tapered. Tapering was used for two reasons. First, radiation drops sharply by distance, as a function divided by the square of the distance, and radiation coupling is relatively poor. This made the use of a higher mass of the then scarce fusion fuel in the rear end of the secondary assembly inefficient and the whole device wasteful. This was also the reason why the lower-enriched slugs of fusion fuel were placed far aft of the fuel capsule. Second, as the primary could not illuminate the whole surface of the hohlraum, in part due to the large axial length of the secondary, relatively small solid angles would be effective to compress the secondary, leading to poor radiation focusing. By tapering, the hohlraum acted in a form of a quasi-parabola in its aft section without having to machine the radiation case to a parabola at both ends, amplifying the radiation focusing and enabling a streamlined production line, as it was cheaper, faster and easier to manufacture the radiation case with only one parabolic end. The tapering in this design was much steeper than its cousins, the RUNT, and the ALARM CLOCK devices. SHRIMP's tapering apparently made the whole secondary assembly resemble the body of a shrimp. The secondary's length is defined by the two pairs of dark-colored diagnostic hot spot pipes attached to the middle and left section of the device. These pipe sections [...] in diameter by [...] long were butt-welded end-to-end to the ballistic case leading out {{to the top of the}} shot cab. They would carry the initial reaction's light up to the array of 12 mirror towers built in an arc on the artificial [...] shot island created for the event. From those pipes, mirrors would reflect early bomb light from the bomb casing to a series of remote high-speed cameras, so that Los Alamos could determine both the simultaneity of the design (i.e. the time interval between primary's firing and secondary's ignition) and the thermonuclear burn rate in these two crucial areas of the secondary device.|$|E

The mathematical model, developed for a porous medium, {{is based on a}} set of equations applied to an annular geometry. Previous major works dealing with the subject have considered the forced convection mode and often did {{not take into account the}} <b>radiation</b> heat <b>transfer.</b> In this work, only free convection and <b>radiation</b> heat <b>transfer</b> are considered. This can occur during the removal of residual heat after shutdown or during an emergency situation. In order to derive the governing equations of <b>radiation</b> heat <b>transfer,</b> a steady-state in an isotropic and emissive porous medium (CO 2) is considered. The obtained system of equations is written in a dimensionless form and then solved. In order to evaluate the effect of <b>radiation</b> heat <b>transfer</b> on the total heat removed, an analytical method for solving the system of equations is used. The results allow quantifying both radiation and free convection heat transfer. For the studied situation, they show that, in a pebble bed modular reactor, more than 70 % of heat is removed by <b>radiation</b> heat <b>transfer</b> when CO 2 is used as the coolant gas...|$|R
