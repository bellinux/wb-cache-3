Our purpose was to evaluate an anthraquinone-based repellent (Arkion Life Sciences, New Castle, DE, USA; active ingredient 50 % 9, 10 -anthraquinone; hereafter anthraquinone) and SucraShieldTM (Natural Forces, Davidson, NC, USA; active ingredient 40 % sucrose octanoate esters) <b>repellent</b> <b>for</b> non-lethal protection of specialty crops (i. e., fruit, sweet corn) and grains. Our objectives were to evaluate (1) laboratory efficacy of anthraquinone applied topically to blueberries and sweet corn, (2) laboratory efficacy of anthraquinone applied to two pellet matrices, and (3) laboratory efficacy of SucraShieldTM as a chemical <b>repellent</b> <b>for</b> European starlings. We found that anthraquinone was not an effective <b>repellent</b> <b>for</b> blueberries or sweet corn, although consumption of each matrix varied potentially due to sucrose content. Anthraquinone was an effective repellent on CU Bird Carrier pellets with 6275 ppm needed to achieve 80 % repellency, whereas up to 35, 000 ppm anthraquinone was not effective when the anthraquinone was not topically applied. SucraShield was not an effective <b>repellent</b> <b>for</b> starlings and in fact increased consumption of CU Bird Carrier as concentration increased...|$|R

40|$|Various {{species of}} rodents and {{lagomorphs}} {{were used in}} bioassays to determine the effectiveness of protein hydrolysates (specifically hydrolyzed casein and gelatin) as herbivore repellents. Mixed sex groups of captive rabbits, pocket gophers, voles, and mountain beavers were offered hydrolyzed casein or gelatin test diets in single-choice tests following a training period with a hydrolysate-free diet. The effectiveness of either hydrolyzed casein or gelatin was dependent on the species. Hydrolyzed casein was identified as an effective <b>repellent</b> <b>for</b> mountain beavers and pocket gophers as these species showed a strong avoidance of hydrolyzed casein diets. Rabbits demonstrated slightly higher avoidance of the gelatin diets versus hydrolyzed casein. However, hydrolyzed casein and gelatin displayed little potential as <b>repellents</b> <b>for</b> voles as both products were readily consumed.
