The work focuses on the realization of three <b>reversible</b> fused floating <b>point</b> units: <b>reversible</b> floating <b>point</b> add-sub unit, <b>reversible</b> floating <b>point</b> multiply-add unit and <b>reversible</b> floating <b>point</b> multiply-subtract unit. The proposed work requires the design of a reversible single precision floating <b>point</b> adder, a <b>reversible</b> single precision floating point subtractor and a reversible single precision floating <b>point</b> multiplier.

It has wide applications like low power CMOS design, Nano-technology, Digital signal processing, Communication, DNA computing and Optical computing. Floating-point operations are needed very frequently in nearly all computing disciplines, and studies have shown floating-point addition/subtraction to be the most used floating-point operation.

For normalization, a 24 -bit Reversible Leading Zero Detector and a 24 -bit reversible shift register is implemented to shift the mantissas.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The aim of {{this article}} is to draw {{theoretical}} lessons from the contemporary transformation of Shi’ism by examining the bearing of history, structure and cultural tradition on the causes and consequences of the Islamic Revolution in Iran. It is argued that the Islamic Revolution can be viewed as the traditionalization of a modernizing nation-state, and at the same time the modernization of the Shi’ite tradition. This apparently paradoxical characterization strongly suggests that a Weberian paradigm for culturally specific patterns of social change is more helpful for its comprehension than any alternative model. Few would dispute that the Islamic Revolution in Iran is one of the major events of the twentieth century, or that it is theoretically as significant as any of the great revolutions of modern times.

40|$|While {{there is}} {{vigorous}} debate {{on whether the}} Anthropocene epoch began in 1800, as originally proposed, less {{attention has been paid}} to the transition from Stage 2 of the existing three stage chronology, in which carbon dioxide emissions accelerated after 1945, to Stage 3, in which after 2015 acceleration is expected to reach criticality, and the Earth System is predicted to pass through an irreversible “tipping point” to a warmer state, unless this is averted by a new planetary stewardship. This paper critically evaluates this chronology and finds (a) that there is insufficient evidence for an imminent irreversible tipping point, and (b) that the international community established a new planetary stewardship in 1992 when it agreed on new conventions on climate change and biodiversity in response to three decades of warnings about global environmental problems. The paper proposes an alternative framework for conceptualizing the transition between Stages 2 and 3 of the Anthropocene. This generates the hypothesis that after the actual carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere has exceeded a critical threshold level, some biophysical processes will change at rates proportional to the difference between the carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere and the threshold level, and to the rate of climate change. Evidence is presented which suggests that this new <b>reversible</b> tipping <b>point</b> could have been passed before 1980, when enhanced forest growth was first observed in mature forests in Amazonia.

40|$|Assume that a {{stochastic}} processes can be approximated, {{when some}} scale parameter gets large, by a fluid limit (also called "mean field limit", or "hydrodynamic limit"). A common practice, {{often called the}} "fixed point approximation" consists in approximating the stationary behaviour of the stochastic process by the stationary points of the fluid limit. It is known {{that this may be}} incorrect in general, as the stationary behaviour of the fluid limit may not be described by its stationary points. We show however that, if the stochastic process is <b>reversible,</b> the fixed <b>point</b> approximation is indeed valid. More precisely, we assume that the stochastic process converges to the fluid limit in distribution (hence in probability) at every fixed point in time. This assumption is very weak and holds for a large family of processes, among which many mean field and other interaction models. We show that the reversibility of the stochastic process implies that any limit point of its stationary distribution is concentrated on stationary points of the fluid limit. If the fluid limit has a unique stationary point, it is an approximation of the stationary distribution of the stochastic process. Comment: 7 pages, preprin...|$|R

Rand R.W., Rinfret A.P., von Lode H., Eds. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas, 1968) and by Mazur (1984): ice formation begins in the intercellular spaces.The vapor pressure of the ice {{is lower than the}} vapor pressure of the solute water in the surrounding cells and as heat is removed at the freezing point of the solutions, the ice crystals grow between the cells, extracting water from them. As the ice crystals grow, the volume of the cells shrinks, and the cells are crushed between the ice crystals. Additionally, as the cells shrink, the solutes inside the cells are concentrated in the remaining water, increasing the intracellular ionic strength and interfering with the organization of the proteins and other organized intercellular structures. Eventually, the solute concentration inside the cells reaches the eutectic and freezes. The final state of frozen tissues is pure ice in the former extracellular spaces, and inside the cell membranes a mixture of concentrated cellular components in ice and bound water.

Gene expression data sets typically contain measurements from thousands of genes for a comparatively small number of samples, or time points. Therefore, biclustering models and algorithms need to be robust to imbalanced dimensions {{if they are to}} be effectively applied to gene expression data. In this thesis, we develop biclustering algorithms for application to gene expression data. A novel, agglomerative biclustering algorithm for application to a data matrix containing observations from a far larger number of genes than samples is introduced. Variable selection is included in this algorithm, allowing sample clusters to be based on only the discriminating gene clusters. This algorithm is developed to ensure a fast computation time and the effect of having a far larger number of genes than samples is examined.

We determine circuit implementations for reversible modular arithmetic, including modular addition, multiplication and inversion, as well as <b>reversible</b> elliptic curve <b>point</b> addition.

40|$|Tendons are {{parallel}} arrays of collagenous fibres which are specialised to resist and transmit tensile stresses. The response of tendon fibres to tensile stress is age-dependent and complex. Elastic elongation at low stress {{is accompanied by}} the disappearance of alternate light and dark bands seen in transmitted polarised light. This region of the stress/strain curve is associated with straightening of fibre 'crimps'. At higher stress, elongation is still elastic and <b>reversible</b> until break <b>point</b> is reached.

In addition to the collagen fibrils, there are transverse and longitudinal proteoglycan filaments, many of which bridge and link between the fibrils.

Proteoglycan-collagen fibril interactions in rat and mouse tail and flexor digitorum tendons were visualised by Cupromeronic blue staining, applied to dissected fibres in the resting state and at stresses up to breaking. Proteoglycan filaments were seen to be orthogonally arranged in every D period, probably at the d band in mature tendons. In immature tendons proteoglycan filaments took up more varied orientations, but were mainly orthogonal or axially arranged with respect to the collagen fibrils.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the immunological repertoire in the peritoneal cavity of gastric cancer patients. METHODS: The peritoneal cavity is a compartment in which immunological host-tumor interactions can occur. However, {{the role of}} lymphocytes in the peritoneal cavity of gastric cancer patients is unclear. We observed 64 patients who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer and 11 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones and acted as controls. Lymphocytes isolated from both peripheral blood and peritoneal lavage were analyzed for surface markers of lymphocytes and their cytokine production by flow cytometry. CD 4 +CD 25 high T cells isolated from the patient&#x 2019;s peripheral blood were co-cultivated for 4 d with the intra-peritoneal lymphocytes, and a cytokine assay was performed. RESULTS: At gastrectomy, CCR 7 - CD 45 RA- CD 8 + effector memory T cells were observed in the peritoneal cavity. The frequency of CD 4 + CD 25 high T cells in both the peripheral blood and peritoneal cavity was elevated in patients at advanced stage [control vs stage IV in the peripheral blood: 6. 89 (3. 39 - 10. 4) vs 15. 34 (11. 37 - 19. 31), P < 0. 05, control vs stage IV in the peritoneal cavity: 8. 65 (5. 28 - 12. 0) vs 19. 56 (14. 81 - 24. 32), P < 0. 05].

40|$|In {{this thesis}} novel self-assembling hydrogels, based on {{physical}} interactions between dextran microgels, potentially suitable for controlled drug delivery and tissue engineering, are presented. Two {{different approaches to}} self-assemble the hydrogels were investigated: ionic interactions and hydrophobic interactions combined with stereocomplexation. In the first approach, dextran derivatized with hydroxyethyl methacrylate (dex-HEMA) was copolymerized with methacrylic acid or N,N-dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate resulting in negatively and positively charged microspheres, respectively, at physiological pH. Because 'opposites attract', hydrogel formation occurred through ionic interactions when aqueous dispersions of both types of microspheres were mixed. Importantly for application of these systems, it was demonstrated that the mainly elastic hydrogel has a <b>reversible</b> yield <b>point,</b> meaning that the material starts to flow above a certain applied stress, whereas gel reformation occurred when the stress is removed. The hydrogel strength was tailored by varying the water content {{of the system and}} the zeta-potential and size (distribution) of the microspheres. Injectability tests showed that hydrogels composed of equal amounts of oppositely charged microspheres (average particle size 7 micrometer) could be injected through 25 G needles using a static load of 15 N, an ISO accepted value. Protein-loaded macroscopic gels were obtained by hydration of mixtures of oppositely charged microspheres with a protein solution. A continuous, diffusion-controlled release of model proteins (lysozyme, BSA and IgG) was observed for 25 to 60 days. Importantly, lysozyme was released quantitatively and with full preservation of its enzymatic activity in about 25 days, emphasizing the protein friendly gel-preparation technology. Swelling studies showed that dispersions containing cationic, neutral or anionic microspheres completely degraded within 30, 55 or 120 days, respectively. Combining the oppositely charged microspheres in different ratios makes it possible to tailor the network properties and the degradation behavior of these hydrogels, making these injectable matrices suitable for various applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering. In the second approach, hydrogels were obtained through hydrophobic self-assembly of and stereocomplexation between dex-HEMA microspheres grafted with oligolactates of opposite chirality. Both the number of oligolactate grafts (DS) and the degree of polymerization (DP) of the oligomers were varied. Rheological analysis of aqueous dispersions of oligolactate-grafted microspheres demonstrated that hydrophobic interactions between oligolactate chains {{on the surface of the}} microspheres resulted in the formation of an almost fully elastic gel. A mixture of microspheres substituted with L- or D-oligolactates of opposite chirality resulted in gels with the highest strength, likely due to stereocomplexation between the enantiomers. The network properties could be modulated by varying the solid content of the gel and the DS and the DP of the oligolactate grafts. The biocompatible nature of the material and the possibility to tailor the gel properties also makes this hydrogel system an attractive candidate for pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. In conclusion, these self-assembling microsphere-based hydrogels hold promise as injectable matrix for diffusion-controlled delivery of pharmaceutically active proteins or as cell-supporting scaffold in tissue engineering. Additionally they could offer the possibility to create an 'all-in-one' protein releasing scaffold: growth factors can be entrapped inside the dex-HEMA microspheres, while cells can be embedded in the macroscopic network...|$|R

As part of an investigation of the Koolau Volcano, Oahu, and the short-term behavior of the geomagnetic field, we have sampled a long volcanic section located on the volcano's buttressed flank within Halawa Valley. Prior paleomagnetic and Potassium–Argon (K–Ar) investigations of the Koolau Volcanic Series revealed excursional directions The alkaline composition of lava flows, easy access, and close geographical proximity to K–Ar dated lava flows made this newly studied 120 -m thick sequence of flows an excellent candidate for detailed paleomagnetic analysis. At least eight samples, collected from each of 28 successive flow sites, were stepwise demagnetized by both alternating field (5 mT to 100 mT) and thermal (from 28 °C to 575 – 650 °C) methods. Mean directions were obtained by principal component analysis. All samples yielded a strong and stable ChRM trending towards the origin of vector demagnetization diagrams based on seven or more demagnetization steps, with thermal and AF results differing insignificantly. Low-field susceptibility vs. temperature (k–T) analysis conducted on individual lava flows indicated approximately half with <b>reversible</b> curves. Curie <b>point</b> determinations from these analyses revealed a temperature close to or equal to 580 °C, indicative of almost pure magnetite ranging from single domain (SD) to pseudosingle domain (PSD) grain sizes for most of the flows. The mean directions of magnetization of the entire section sampled indicate a reversed polarity, with not, vert, similar 10 m of the section characterized by excursional directions (5 lava flows). The corresponding VGPs are located off the southeastern part of Africa, close to Madagascar. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar incremental heating experiments on groundmass from nine flow sites at different stratigraphic levels yields isochrons between 2. 64 ± 0. 23 to 2. 37 ± 0. 17 Ma with a weighted mean age of 2. 514 ± 0. 039 Ma, which, combined with the overall reversed polarity and the absence of polarity reversals, strongly suggests that the excursion corresponds to Cryptochron C 2 r. 2 r- 1 [S.

It is then pointed out that the {{problem of the}} entropy of the universe arises in the classical thermodynamics because of the presumption that thermodynamic processes cannot take place both reversibly and at a finite rate, and that the general nature of the contribution to the problem offered by relativistic thermodynamics consists in showing the possibility of thermodynamic changes which could take place at a finite rate and at the same time reversibly without increase in entropy. The principles of relativistic thermodynamics are then reviewed, and this difference between the classical and relativistic thermodynamics is shown by considering the possibilities of carrying out reversible changes at a finite rate in the properties of a thermodynamic fluid. In the classical thermodynamics it is found that no change in the thermodynamic properties could be allowed to take place at a finite rate, the entropy density of the fluid necessarily remaining constant in accordance with the equation dφ 0 /dt= 0. On the other hand, in relativistic thermodynamics it is found possible to allow changes to take place at a finite rate in the proper volume of the fluid, due to changes in the gravitational potentials gμν, and still maintain reversibility provided the changes satisfy the relation ∂/∂x 4 (φ 0 sqrt[-g]dx 4 /ds) = 0. To exhibit the nature of the reversible changes at a finite rate thus permitted in relativistic thermodynamics, consideration is given to the highly idealized model of a non-static universe filled with black-body radiation as a thermodynamic fluid, and it is shown that the radius, total proper volume, and entropy density of such a universe could be changing at a finite rate and yet reversibly without increase in entropy. Furthermore, in the case of an expanding model of the kind considered, it is shown that an ordinary observer, who marks out with rigid meter sticks a small region of this universe in his immediate vicinity for study, would find the energy density, energy content, and the temperature of this region decreasing with the time, and would find the number of quanta leaving the region per second greater than the number entering, and the average frequency of the quanta that leave greater than that of those that return. These phenomena would be interpreted by the observer, from a classical point of view, as due to radiation from his neighborhood into the colder surroundings of space and hence as leading to an increase in entropy, in spite of the fact that all the processes taking place in such a model would actually be <b>reversible</b> from the <b>point</b> of view of the relativistic thermodynamics which should be applied to such a problem. In conclusion remarks are made concerning the disparity between the above model, which was chosen for purposes of illustration because of its mathematical simplicity, and models which would be more suitable to serve as representations of the actual universe. And some indication is given of the further developments that should be undertaken...|$|R
