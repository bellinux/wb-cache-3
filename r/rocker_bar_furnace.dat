25|$|When {{negative}} pressure (pushing {{down on the}} spine) {{is applied to the}} blade all the stress is transferred from the hook on the blade's tang to the hook on <b>rocker</b> <b>bar</b> and thence to the small rocker pin. Excessive stress can shear one or both of these hooks rendering the knife effectively useless. Knife company Cold Steel uses a variant of the lock back called the Tri-Ad Lock which introduces a pin in front of the <b>rocker</b> <b>bar</b> to relieve stress on the rocker pin, has an elongated hole around the rocker pin to allow the mechanism to wear over time without losing strength and angles the hooks so that the faces no longer meet vertically.|$|R

40|$|In The Netherlands, about 50 % of all amputations of {{the lower}} limb are toes and {{forefoot}} amputations. Traumata of toes and mid-foot are rare. Preservation of the foot is the primary goal for treatment. Crush injuries of the foot {{may be associated with}} prolonged morbidity. This case study presents an insole solution for the solitary first phalangeal bone after amputation of the phalangeal bones II-V. The normal adaptation for forefoot amputations is stiffening of the sole of the shoe and a <b>rocker</b> <b>bar</b> to improve the toe off phase with load reduction of the forefoot. Because the patient had to do excessive stair climbing during work another solution was chosen. As a foot orthosis, a metal soleplate was made in order to have free movement during loading and toe-off during walking. The soleplate gives safety and provides self-adjusting properties after toe off. This enables the shoe technician to make a shoe without a <b>rocker</b> <b>bar</b> or an extra stiff insole. The 0. 5 mm custom-made spring-steel plate is also used as a protective in industrial safety shoes. To improve shoe adaptation more research and case reports have to be published in order to inform doctors and shoe technicians about everyday solutions to partial foot amputations...|$|R

50|$|A rocker sole shoe or {{rocker bottom}} shoe is a shoe {{which has a}} thicker-than-normal sole with rounded heel. Such shoes ensure the wearer does not have flat footing along the proximal-distal axis of the foot. The shoes are generically known {{by a variety of}} names {{including}} round bottom shoes, round/ed sole shoes, and toning shoes, but also by various brand names. Tyrell & Carter identified at least six standard variations of the rocker sole shoe and named them: toe-only <b>rocker,</b> <b>rocker</b> <b>bar,</b> mild <b>rocker,</b> heel-to-toe rocker, negative heel rocker and double rocker.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{areas of}} consensus and disagreement among Dutch physiatrists concerning prescription of therapeutic footwear for the neuropathic foot {{and to develop}} a research agenda. Study Design and Setting: Forty participants were physiatrists and experts in the field of orthopedic shoe techniques. Four postal Delphi rounds were followed by a final plenary session. Results: Forty of the 44 invited experts participated in all postal Delphi rounds, with an overall response of 100 %. They achieved consensus on the following. 1. (Dutch) Terminology for two sets of domains and dimensions for the various features of the neuropathic foot and for the shoe characteristics. 2. Application of specific shoe components: insole, shaft, outsole, tongue, and heel. In most features of the neuropathic foot, shaft and outsole domains were linked in the flexibility dimension. 3. Shoe prescriptions for various features of the neuropathic foot in at least four technical domains. Experts disagreed on application of <b>rocker</b> <b>bar</b> and shaft height. In a final conference, 31 experts agreed on a prioritized research agenda. Conclusion: An intensive Delphi process yielded consensus on terminology, and determined areas of consensus and disagreement for future research for the various features of the neuropathic foot and the shoe characteristics. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Chemical analysis, optical {{absorption}} spectroscopy and mathematical modelling of high temperature viscosity {{have been carried}} out on five 1 st– 2 nd century AD Roman blue-green bottle glass fragments from Coppergate, York. Modelled viscosities indicate remarkable consistency within the sample set studied and support the suggestion that temperatures of ∼ 1000 – 1150 °C were required to remelt these glasses and to provide suitable viscosities for forming articles. Iron redox ratios (Fe 2 +/ΣFe), analysed SO 3 contents and the absence of characteristic Fe 3 +–S 2 − amber absorption bands suggest that melting conditions for all studied glasses were mildly, rather than strongly, reducing (estimated pO 2 ≈ 10 − 1 – 10 − 6 <b>bar).</b> These <b>furnace</b> conditions are consistent with the effects of combustion gases and carbonaceous matter contained in the raw materials...|$|R

30|$|Let us briefly {{discuss the}} impact of {{synthesis}} pressure on CNT yield. It was revealed that prolongation of reaction time in our experiments for more than 45 min did not increase significantly {{the mass of the}} CNT product. That fact usually contributed to the diffusion issue of carbon feedstock molecules through the mat of CNTs [31]. However, it was found that increasing the pressure up to 2 <b>bars</b> in the <b>furnace</b> during CNT synthesis, as was described in the experimental part, leads to the CNT-yield increase approximately by 20 wt.% (see Figure 9, red curve). Thus, we attribute the longer catalytic activity and, as a consequence, the higher CNT yield at the realized synthesis conditions to the increasing hydrocarbon molecular diffusivity as the gas pressure increases.|$|R
60|$|Thence to {{the first}} stage, the {{chopping}} up of the iron <b>bars,</b> the <b>furnace,</b> the punching {{out of the first}} shape of the shell; all this is men's work. I had seen this sort of thing before in peace ironworks, but I saw it again with the same astonishment, the absolute precision of movement {{on the part of the}} half-naked sweating men, the calculated efficiency of each worker, the apparent heedlessness, the real certitude, with which the blazing hot cylinder is put here, dropped there, rolls to its next appointed spot, is chopped up and handed on, the swift passage to the cooling crude, pinkish-purple shell shape. Down a long line one sees in perspective a practical symmetry, of furnace and machine group and the shells marching on from this first series of phases to undergo the long succession of operations, machine after machine, across the great width of the shed in which eighty per cent of the workers are women. There is a thick dust of sounds in the air, a rumble of shafting, sudden thuddings, clankings, and M. Citroen has to raise his voice.

40|$|Within {{ilmenite}} smelters, the slag is at {{a temperature}} just above its liquidus (because the furnace operates with a slag freeze lining), and the metal bath is at a temperature which is approximately 150 °C {{lower than the}} slag temperature. As a result, solidification of the slag {{in contact with the}} metal is expected, and was indeed detected with sounding <b>bars</b> in operating <b>furnaces.</b> Samples of the solidified layer were obtained from a DC ilmenite smelter which had cooled with its contents intact. Analysis showed parts of the layer to be close to anosovite (Ti 3 O 5) in composition; in all cases, the solid contained much less FeO than the primary pseudobrookite which forms during bulk slag solidification after tapping. Equilibrium calculations show that these compositions can result from reaction of initially FeO-rich pseudobrookite with dissolved carbon in the metal bath. The presence of this layer of near-anosovite material in the furnace has possible implications for settling of metal and for the furnace energy balance; the latter was explored with thermodynamic calculations.

40|$|Tension {{stiffening}} and - {{more generally}} – bond has attracted scanty {{attention in the}} recent past with reference to fire and high temperature, probably because of scholars’ and designers’ opinion that sectional collapse due to the strength loss in the rebars be more critical than the overall collapse due to bond loss. (As a matter of fact, bond losses involve the length of the reinforcement and not a single section, as bending). However, since many R/C structures survive a fire and require their residual safety level to be assessed, knowing bond properties and having information on tension stiffening in residual conditions is a necessary step to reliably analyze the structural behavior past a fire. In this research project, tension stiffening is investigated by testing a number of reinforced tension members initially exposed to a rather severe fire (750 °C) to investigate concrete spalling. Later, the specimens were kept at 750 °C for a time length sufficient to have a uniform thermal field in excess of 600 °C, in and around the <b>bar.</b> An electric <b>furnace</b> pre-heated to 750 °C was used. After the removal from the furnace, each specimen was tested by applying opposite forces at the end sections, to check the effectiveness of tension stiffening in residual conditions. The total number of specimens in this preliminary experimental campaign was 11. Three self-compacting mixes were used (fc = 50, 80 and 90 MPa). Only 5 specimens showed a non-negligible tension stiffening, and the justification of such weak effect was found in the marked bond sensitivity to high temperature, something that was also checked by means of a rather simple slip-based model...|$|R

40|$|Positive {{europium}} anomalies are {{ubiquitous in}} the plagioclase-rich rocks {{of the lunar}} highlands, and complementary negative Eu anomalies are found in most lunar basalts. This is taken as evidence of a large-scale differentation event, with crystallization of a global-scale lunar magma ocean (LMO) resulting in a plagioclase flotation crust and a mafic lunar interior from which mare basalts were later derived. However, {{the extent of the}} Eu anomaly in lunar rocks is variable. Some plagioclase grains in a lunar impact rock (60635) have been reported to display a negative Eu anomaly, or in some cases single grains display both positive and neagtive anomalies. Cathodoluminescence images reveal that some crystals have a negative anomaly in the core and positive at the rim, or vice versa, and the negative anomalies are not associated with crystal overgrowths. Oxygen fugacity is known to affect Eu partitioning into plagioclase, as under low fO 2 conditions Eu can be divalent, and has an ionic radius similar to Ca 2 + - significant in lunar samples where plagioclase compositions are predominantly anorthitic. However, there are very few experimental studies of rare earth element (REE) partitioning in plagioclase relevant to lunar magmatism, with only two plagioclase DEu measurements from experiments using lunar materials, and little data in low fO 2 conditions relevant to the Moon. We report on REE partitioning experiments on lunar compositions. We investigate two lunar basaltic compositions, high-alumina basalt 14072 and impact melt breccia 60635. These samples span a large range of lunar surface bulk compositions. The experiments are carried out at variable fO 2 in 1 <b>bar</b> gas mixing <b>furnaces,</b> and REE are analysed by and LA-ICP-MS. Our results not only greatly expand the existing plagioclase DREE database for lunar compositions, but also investigate the significance of fO 2 in Eu partitioning, and in the interpretation of Eu anomalies in lunar materials...|$|R
