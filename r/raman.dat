The film premiered at the 2016 Sydney Film Festival and the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, in the Director's Fortnight section to positive response.|$|E
5|$|<b>Raman</b> {{spectroscopy}} {{has good}} spatial resolution (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal sample preparation and is rather informative. Consequently, <b>Raman</b> spectroscopy {{is probably the}} most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. <b>Raman</b> scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those tubes are probed which have one of the bandgaps equal to the exciting laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{photoluminescence}} mapping, {{the energy}} of the excitation light can be scanned in <b>Raman</b> measurements, thus producing <b>Raman</b> maps. Those maps also contain oval-shaped features uniquely identifying (n,m) indices. Contrary to PL, <b>Raman</b> mapping detects not only semiconducting but also metallic tubes, and it is less sensitive to nanotube bundling than PL. However, requirement of a tunable laser and a dedicated spectrometer is a strong technical impediment.|$|E
5|$|After <b>Raman</b> Abdullah, Mahendra took a {{break from}} films during which he made Kathai Neram, a {{television}} series based on different short stories, mostly by Sujatha. It was aired in Sun TV during the early 2000s.|$|E
5|$|All {{the above}} <b>Raman</b> modes can be {{observed}} both as Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering. As mentioned above, <b>Raman</b> scattering from CNTs is resonant in nature, i.e. only tubes whose band gap energy {{is similar to the}} laser energy are excited. The difference between those two energies, and thus the band gap of individual tubes, can be estimated from the intensity ratio of the Stokes/anti-Stokes lines. This estimate however relies on the temperature factor (Boltzmann factor), which is often miscalculated – a focused laser beam is used in the measurement, which can locally heat the nanotubes without changing the overall temperature of the studied sample.|$|E
5|$|In astrobiology, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that discrete vanadium accumulations on Mars could be a potential microbial biosignature, when used in conjunction with <b>Raman</b> spectroscopy and morphology.|$|E
5|$|Interactions between nanotubes, such as {{bundling}}, broaden optical lines. While bundling strongly affects photoluminescence, it {{has much}} weaker effect on optical absorption and <b>Raman</b> scattering. Consequently, sample {{preparation for the}} latter two techniques is relatively simple.|$|E
5|$|Kolkata houses many premier {{research}} institutes like Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Bose Institute, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP), All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute (CGCRI), S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences (SNBNCBS), Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (IISWBM), National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Kolkata, Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC) and Indian Centre for Space Physics. Nobel laureate Sir C. V. <b>Raman</b> did his groundbreaking work in <b>Raman</b> {{effect in}} IACS.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{people who}} were either born or educated at Tiruchirappalli include {{scientists}} C. V. <b>Raman,</b> A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, Sujatha Rangarajan, Vaali, G. N. Ramachandran, and former President of India R. Venkataraman.|$|E
5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by encapsulating organic dyes (carotene, lycopene, etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon nanotube can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, <b>Raman</b> spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing measurement and analysis of their <b>Raman</b> spectra.|$|E
5|$|Other overtones, {{such as a}} {{combination}} of RBM+G mode at ~1750cm−1, are frequently seen in CNT <b>Raman</b> spectra. However, they are less important and are not considered here.|$|E
5|$|Photoluminescence from SWCNT, {{as well as}} optical {{absorption}} and <b>Raman</b> scattering, is linearly polarized along the tube axis. This allows monitoring of the SWCNTs orientation without direct microscopic observation.|$|E
5|$|Solid argon hydride (Ar(H2)2) has {{the same}} crystal {{structure}} as the MgZn2 Laves phase. It forms at pressures between 4.3 and 220 GPa, though <b>Raman</b> measurements suggest that the H2 molecules in Ar(H2)2 dissociate above 175 GPa.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{research}} institutes in Kolkata. The Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science is the first research institute in Asia. C. V. <b>Raman</b> was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery (<b>Raman</b> Effect) done in IACS. The Bose Institute, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, S. N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute, National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBMG), Kalyani, and the Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre are the most prominent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Raman</b> {{spectroscopy}} {{employs the}} <b>Raman</b> effect for substances analysis. The {{spectrum of the}} Raman-scattered light depends on the molecular constituents present and their state, allowing the spectrum {{to be used for}} material identification and analysis. <b>Raman</b> spectroscopy is used to analyze a wide range of materials, including gases, liquids, and solids. Highly complex materials such as biological organisms and human tissue can also be analyzed by <b>Raman</b> spectroscopy.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a number}} of {{challenges}} for <b>Raman</b> amplifiers prevented their earlier adoption. First, compared to the EDFAs, <b>Raman</b> amplifiers have relatively poor pumping efficiency at lower signal powers. Although a disadvantage, this lack of pump efficiency also makes gain clamping easier in <b>Raman</b> amplifiers. Second, <b>Raman</b> amplifiers require a longer gain fiber. However, this disadvantage can be mitigated by combining gain and the dispersion compensation in a single fiber. A third disadvantage of <b>Raman</b> amplifiers is a fast response time, which gives rise to new sources of noise, as further discussed below. Finally, there are concerns of nonlinear penalty in the amplifier for the WDM signal channels.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, stimulated <b>Raman</b> {{scattering}} {{can take place}} when some Stokes photons have previously been generated by spontaneous <b>Raman</b> scattering (and somehow forced {{to remain in the}} material), or when deliberately injecting Stokes photons ("signal light") together with the original light ("pump light"). In that case, the total Raman-scattering rate is increased beyond that of spontaneous <b>Raman</b> scattering: pump photons are converted more rapidly into additional Stokes photons. The more Stokes photons are already present, the faster more of them are added. Effectively, this amplifies the Stokes light {{in the presence of the}} pump light, which is exploited in <b>Raman</b> amplifiers and <b>Raman</b> lasers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Raman</b> optical {{activity}} spectroscopy exploits <b>Raman</b> scattering and {{optical activity}} effects to reveal {{detailed information on}} chiral centers in molecules.|$|E
25|$|Scanning Habitable Environments with <b>Raman</b> and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC), an {{ultraviolet}} <b>Raman</b> spectrometer {{that uses}} fine-scale imaging and an ultraviolet (UV) laser to determine fine-scale mineralogy and detect organic compounds.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Raman</b> {{effect is}} also {{involved}} in producing {{the appearance of the}} blue sky (see Rayleigh Effect: 'Rayleigh scattering of molecular nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere includes elastic scattering as well as the inelastic contribution from rotational <b>Raman</b> scattering in air').|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Linn Mollenauer and {{his team}} {{transmitted}} soliton pulses over 4,000 kilometres using a phenomenon called the <b>Raman</b> effect, named for the Indian scientist Sir C. V. <b>Raman</b> who first described it in the 1920s, to provide optical gain in the fibre.|$|E
25|$|<b>Raman</b> {{amplifiers}} {{have some}} fundamental advantages. First, <b>Raman</b> gain exists in every fiber, {{which provides a}} cost-effective means of upgrading from the terminal ends. Second, the gain is nonresonant, which means that gain is available over the entire transparency region of the fiber ranging from approximately 0.3 to 2µm. A third advantage of <b>Raman</b> amplifiers is that the gain spectrum can be tailored by adjusting the pump wavelengths. For instance, multiple pump lines {{can be used to}} increase the optical bandwidth, and the pump distribution determines the gain flatness. Another advantage of <b>Raman</b> amplification {{is that it is a}} relatively broad-band amplifier with a bandwidth > 5 THz, and the gain is reasonably flat over a wide wavelength range.|$|E
25|$|Suppose that a {{monochromatic}} light is pulsed, then scattered by molecules having a quadrupole (<b>Raman)</b> resonance frequency. If “length of light pulses is shorter than all involved time constants” (Lamb (1971)), an “impulsive stimulated <b>Raman</b> scattering (ISRS) ” (Yan, Gamble & Nelson (1985)) works: While light generated by incoherent <b>Raman</b> at a shifted frequency has a phase independent on phase of exciting light, thus generates a new spectral line, coherence between incident and scattered light allows their interference {{into a single}} frequency, thus shifts incident frequency.|$|E
25|$|<b>Raman</b> Subba Row A ball hit by Ron Archer broke <b>Raman</b> Subba Row's wrist when fielding against Queensland, another injury removed {{him from}} {{contention}} {{after he had}} made three fifties in three games when Richardson and Milton were out of form {{and needed to be}} replaced.|$|E
25|$|<b>Raman</b> {{amplification}} {{is used in}} optical amplifiers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Raman</b> {{scattering}} {{is another}} phenomenon that involves inelastic scattering of light {{caused by the}} vibrational properties of matter. The detected range of frequency shifts and other effects are very different compared to Brillouin scattering. In <b>Raman</b> scattering, photons are scattered by the effect of vibrational and rotational transitions in the bonds between first-order neighboring atoms, while Brillouin scattering results from the scattering of photons caused by large scale, low-frequency phonons. The effects of the two phenomena provide very different information about the sample: <b>Raman</b> spectroscopy {{can be used to}} determine the transmitting medium's chemical composition and molecular structure, while Brillouin scattering can be used to measure the material's properties on a larger scale – such as its elastic behaviour. The frequency shifts from Brillouin scattering, a technique known as Brillouin Spectroscopy, are detected with an interferometer while <b>Raman</b> scattering uses either an interferometer or a dispersive (grating) spectrometer.|$|E
25|$|The leaf extract has {{recently}} been used to produce silver nanoparticles for surface-enhanced <b>Raman</b> spectroscopy.|$|E
25|$|Inelastic neutron {{scattering}} {{is similar to}} <b>Raman</b> spectroscopy, but uses neutrons instead of photons.|$|E
25|$|Many of Pillai's {{letters to}} A. <b>Raman</b> Pillai, then {{a student in}} the University of Göttingen, were kept by <b>Raman</b> Pillai's son Rosscote Krishna Pillai. The letters reveal some aspects of Pillai's life in Germany between 1914 and 1920, as does one of July 1914, calling upon Indian {{soldiers}} in the British Indian Army to rise in revolt and fight against the British.|$|E
25|$|For solid materials, <b>Raman</b> {{scattering}} {{is used as}} a tool {{to detect}} high-frequency phonon and magnon excitations.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the {{inception}} of IISc in 1909, Morris Travers, Sir William Ramsay's co-worker in the discovery of the noble gases, became its first Director. For Travers, this was a natural continuation of his work on the Institute, since he had played a role in its founding. The first Indian Director was the Nobel Laureate Sir C.V. <b>Raman.</b> <b>Raman</b> was the Indian Science-based Nobel Laureate. The current Director is Anurag Kumar.|$|E
25|$|Stimulated <b>Raman</b> {{transitions}} {{are also}} widely used for manipulating a trapped ion's energy levels, and thus basis qubit states.|$|E
25|$|<b>Raman</b> lidar {{is used in}} {{atmospheric}} physics to measure the atmospheric extinction coefficient and the water vapour vertical distribution.|$|E
25|$|For high-intensity {{continuous}} wave (CW) lasers, SRS {{can be used}} to produce broad bandwidth spectra. This process can also be seen as a special case of four-wave mixing, wherein the frequencies of the two incident photons are equal and the emitted spectra are found in two bands separated from the incident light by the phonon energies. The initial <b>Raman</b> spectrum is built up with spontaneous emission and is amplified later on. At high pumping levels in long fibers, higher-order <b>Raman</b> spectra can be generated by using the <b>Raman</b> spectrum as a new starting point, thereby building a chain of new spectra with decreasing amplitude. The disadvantage of intrinsic noise due to the initial spontaneous process can be overcome by seeding a spectrum at the beginning, or even using a feedback loop as in a resonator to stabilize the process. Since this technology easily fits into the fast evolving fiber laser field and there is demand for transversal coherent high-intensity light sources (i.e., broadband telecommunication, imaging applications), <b>Raman</b> amplification and spectrum generation might be widely used in the near-future.|$|E
25|$|Coherent anti-Stokes <b>Raman</b> {{spectroscopy}} (CARS) is {{a recent}} technique that has high sensitivity and powerful applications for in vivo spectroscopy and imaging.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar, {{established}} the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, a national institution for higher learning whose primary {{purpose is to}} foster high quality fundamental research in frontier disciplines of the basic sciences, at 210 Bowbazar Street, in July 1876. It later moved to Jadavpur. It was at the laboratories of this institution that Sir C. V. <b>Raman</b> did his monumental work on Physical Optics {{that lead to the}} discovery of the <b>Raman</b> Effect, for which <b>Raman</b> was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Science won by an Indian.
