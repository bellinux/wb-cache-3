Initially unarmed, he fights using his claws, but can {{alternatively}} use weapons such as rocks, torches, spears and staffs, and the Soul Reaver. Raziel can freely shift to the spectral <b>realm,</b> but can return to the material <b>realm</b> only through special portals when at full health. Raziel automatically shifts to the spectral <b>realm</b> if he runs out of health. As the game progresses, Raziel gains the powers of his clan brothers after defeating them and becomes able to phase through gates in the spectral <b>realm</b> and climb walls in the material <b>realm.</b> Initially vulnerable to water, he overcomes this weakness and learns to swim.|$|E

However, when the series first aired on October 8, 1999, the comics' writers Andrew Paquette and James Hudnall were given no writing credits for the work; the two then filed suit against Fox to be credited for their work. Harsh <b>Realm</b> received disappointing viewing figures, and was cancelled after only three episodes had been broadcast.|$|E

The Forgotten <b>Realms</b> Campaign Guide, released August 2008, is a 288-page book for Dungeon Masters.

An adventure, Scepter Tower of Spellgard, was also released in September 2008 and can be used in combination with the adventure in the Forgotten <b>Realms</b> Campaign Guide to start a Forgotten <b>Realms</b> campaign. In 2008, the Forgotten <b>Realms</b> also became the setting for the RPGA's sole living campaign, Living Forgotten <b>Realms,</b> replacing Living Greyhawk.

5|$|Combat in Soul Reaver is a hack and slash system, {{involving}} {{the use of}} combinations of various different attacks before a finishing move. Raziel's enemies are grouped into humans, spectral creatures, and most commonly, vampires. Human enemies include peasants, vampire hunters and vampire worshippers. In the spectral <b>realm,</b> players fight minor enemies called Sluagh and the souls of dead vampires who have become wraiths. Each brood of vampire enemies has unique powers reminiscent of their clan leader. Human and spectral enemies can be killed with Raziel's claws or any weapon, but vampires must be bludgeoned into a stunned state and then destroyed by impaling them, lighting them on fire, or tossing them into a hazard such as sunlight or water. When killed, enemies leave behind souls that replenish Raziel's health, which automatically decreases in the material <b>realm</b> and increases in the spectral. Possession of the Soul Reaver sword stops automatic degeneration of health in the physical <b>realm,</b> but Raziel loses the sword instantly if he sustains damage and can regain it only by restoring his health to full.|$|E

5|$|In the {{interest}} of strengthening the defenses of the kingdom, Andriamasinavalona divided his <b>realm</b> into four quadrants to be ruled by his four favorite sons. This decision had the opposite effect, however; each was interested in expanding his own <b>realm,</b> prompting one son to kidnap the king and hold him hostage for seven years. After the king's eventual release, he famously committed a mock human sacrifice to re-sanctify his authority. Upon his death, Andriamasinavalona's sons launched military campaigns against one another to seize each other's territories, triggering 77 years of civil war in Imerina. In Madagascar today, Andriamasinavalona's reign is remembered as a golden age of justice, harmony and prosperity.|$|E
