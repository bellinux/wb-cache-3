40|$|In a multi-echelon {{service parts}} supply chain with limited repair resources, {{real-time}} repair decisions have significant impacts on supply chain performance. Inducting into repair the appropriate {{breadth and depth}} of components is essential to meeting short-term and long-term customer service level constraints. Previous research in this area primarily focuses on steady-state supply chains assuming infinite repair capabilities and the repair induction of all non-serviceable parts. This thesis develops a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MIP) which considers {{the current state of the}} entire repair system as well as forecasted part-breakages to produce strategic real-time <b>repair</b> <b>recommendations.</b> Repair inductions are prioritized to maximize stock location service levels over multiple budget periods through comparative fill rates encompassing both issue effectiveness and sub-system availability.

40|$|Diagnosing {{multiple}} faults for a complex system is often very difficult. It requires {{not only a}} model which adequately represents the diagnostic aspect of a complex system, but also an efficient diagnostic algorithm that can generate effective test and <b>repair</b> <b>recommendations.</b> One way of developing such an efficient and effective diagnostic algorithm is to focus the computational resource on disambiguating a set of the most likely potential faults, called focus faults. In this paper, we apply decision theory to analyze strategies for selecting focus faults. We propose a decision-theoretic focusing strategy {{which is based on}} users ’ risk tolerances. The proposed focusing strategy has been applied to a large diagnostic model for locomotives, which has been deployed in the field.

Formerly, the sugar factory was designed to fulfil their energy demand by using an abundance free energy sources, called “baggase”. However, a fossil fuel consumption (i. e. residue) increased sharply to supply boilers due to the baggase availability was not sufficient. It impacted to the increasing of operational costs. Therefore, an energy saving study for the factory had been an interesting subject. The study proposed to assess boilers performance in the factory to reduce residue consumption. A detail energy audit method was conducted to identify the actual energy consumption, energy losses, and energy saving potential. The study results showed that energy saving potential for the boilers was about 11 %. The main energy saving measures was to increase boilers efficiency from 64 % to 75 %.

40|$|Epoxy grouts {{have been}} widely used for {{repairing}} and rehabilitating structure and transportation pipelines because they are resistant to typical aggressive solutions. In recent years, grouts are used as structural infill in defective structures. The appropriateness of using grouts is highly dependent on the required strength of structures in service condition. This paper experimentally studies the mechanical properties of four epoxy grouts as infill components for structural repair. Compressive, tensile, shear, and flexural properties are determined and compared. The compressive and tensile strengths of the grouts are found to be within the range of 60 - 115 MPa and 10 - 30 MPa respectively, while their compressive modulus ranging from 1. 5 to 6. 0 GPa were measured. The overall results suggest the suitability of these grouts for desired structural <b>repair</b> applications. Finally, <b>recommendations</b> are made on the relevance of using these grouts based on their mechanical properties.

40|$|The thesis delves {{into the}} area of {{troubleshooting}} procedures, an interesting areafor industry. Many products in industry tend to be complex, which in turn makestroubleshooting procedures trickier. A fast and efficient repair process is oftendesired, since customers want the product to be repaired as fast as possible. The purpose of a troubleshooting procedure {{is to find a}} fault in a broken product,and to choose proper repair actions in a workshop. Such a procedure can besimplified by diagnosis tools, for example software programs that make faultconclusions based on fault codes. These tools can make such conclusions withthe help of algorithms, i. e. fault tracing algorithms. Before a product release, it is hard to specify all faults and connections in the system. New unknown fault cases are likely to arise after release, and somehow thisneed {{to be taken into account}} in the troubleshooting scenario. The troubleshootingprocedure can be made more robust, if new data could be easily incorporatedin the current structure. This work seek to answer how new data can be incorporatedin trouble shooting procedures. A good and reliable fault tracing algorithm is essential in the process of findingfaults and repair actions, which is the reason behind the focus of this thesis. Thepresented problem asks how a fault can be identified from fault codes and symptoms,in order to recommend suitable repair actions. Therefore, the problem isdivided into two parts, finding the fault and recommending repair actions. Inthe first part, three candidate algorithms for finding the faults are investigated,namely Bayesian networks, neural networks, and a method called matrix correlationinspired from latent semantic indexing. The investigation is done by trainingeach algorithm with data, and evaluating the results. The second part consists ofone method proposal for <b>repair</b> action <b>recommendations</b> and one example. Thetheoretical investigation is based on the Servo unit steering (SUS), which residein the IPS system of Volvo Penta.

In this study Bayesian networks are found to conform well with the desired attributes,which in turn lead to the conclusion that Bayesian networks is well suited for this problem...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop probabilistic procedures to improve present methods of analysis and design for embankment dams. Presently, the safety of an embankment slope is assessed by calculating a factor of safety which relates soil strength and loading conditions. Strengths are represented by single values chosen from scattered test results; both the 2 ̆ 2 strengths 2 ̆ 2 and the factor of safety are uncertain quantities. ^ In the proposed procedure, uncertainty was accommodated by treating strength as a random variable. Procedures were developed to characterize soil strength by a beta distribution fitted to three probabilistic moments. Strength variability for the Clarence Cannon Dam was estimated using a large number of tests obtained during embankment construction. ^ The use of a probabilistic design method necessitates the prediction of the expected mean and variance of embankment strength. Data from Cannon Dam was used to develop a recommended prediction procedure. ^ A review of existing probabilistic slope stability methods revealed several limitations regarding the general analysis and design of dam embankments: these relate to the ability to accommodate embankment zonation, loading conditions, possible failure surface shapes, and the shape of the strength probability distributions. An analysis procedure was developed that accommodates skewed strength distributions, the correlation between the (phi) and c strength parameters, multiple soils, and failure surfaces of a general shape. Results are expressed in terms of a 2 ̆ 2 probability of failure 2 ̆ 2 or reliability index. ^ Using the developed method, a series of parametric studies were performed for Cannon Dam to evaluate the relationship between probability of failure and loading conditions, parameter skewness, parameter correlation, reservoir level, and factor of safety. Different loading conditions having similar factors of safety were found to have greatly different probabilities of failure. The probability of failure was found to be strongly dependent on strength parameter correlation and somewhat dependent on parameter skewness. The method was also used to study Shelbyville Dam, where a slide had occurred, and to evaluate the increase in reliability due to its <b>repair.</b> ^ <b>Recommendations</b> are offered for the implementation of the proposed procedures in design practice. ...|$|R
