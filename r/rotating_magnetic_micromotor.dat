50|$|The {{operation}} of a synchronous motor {{is due to the}} interaction of the magnetic fields of the stator and the rotor. Its stator winding, which consists of a 3 phase winding, is provided with a 3 phase supply, and the rotor is provided with a DC supply. The 3 phase stator winding carrying 3 phase currents produces 3 phase <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> flux (and therefore a <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> field). The rotor locks in with the <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> field and <b>rotates</b> along with it. Once the rotor locks in with the <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> field, the motor is said to be in synchronization.
