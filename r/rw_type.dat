40|$|Observation {{evidence}} {{from a variety}} of sources points to an accelerating universe which is spatially approximately flat and with (ΩM,ΩΛ) 0 ≈ (0. 3, 0. 7). We have shown for low redshifts, z ≤ 0. 2, the metric of this cosmological model is equivalant to the de Sitter metric within one persent error. Commonly two different coordinate systems are being used for describing de Sitter model, one yields a non-static and <b>RW</b> <b>type</b> while the other one gives a static and Schwarzschild type metric. We have obtained the magnitude-redshift relation in the second coordinate system. Our result indicates a slope of 2. 5. This is in disagreement with observation which is close to the slope of 5. This test discards the second and confirms the first coordinate system as a proper comoving frame for describing de Sitter space. We anticipate this test disqualifies any other solution of the field equation which asymptotically approach to static de Sitter metric, e. g. the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric for space-time around a point mass m...|$|E
40|$|An {{infrared}} photometric {{survey of}} 89 <b>RW</b> Aur <b>type</b> variables in both hemispheres has been made. JHKL magnitudes and colors are listed. The RW Aur variables include {{a small number}} of highly reddened late-type stars. All T Tauri and hot Orion population stars show infrared excesses and the infrared properties mark certain field stars as being young. The greatest infrared excesses are found for A and F stars while young variable B stars usually show no excesses. The location of the RW Aur stars in the two-color H-K, K-L diagram favor dust re-radiation over free-free emission as the mechanism responsible for the infrared excess. A weak correlation of H-K with emission class links the occurrence of circumstellar dust and gas shells...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new mode of operation for CD-systems of restarting automata by providing explicit enable and disable conditions {{in the form of}} regular constraints. We show that, for each CD-system M of restarting automata and each mode m of operation considered by Messerschmidt and Otto, there exists a CD-system M' of restarting automata of the same type as M that, working in the new mode ed, accepts the language that M accepts in mode m. Further, we prove that in mode ed, a locally deterministic CD-system of restarting automata of type RR(W) (W) can be simulated by a locally deterministic CD-system of restarting automata of the more restricted <b>type</b> <b>R(W)</b> (W). This {{is the first time that}} a non-monotone type of R-automaton without auxiliary symbols is shown to be as expressive as the corresponding type of RR-automaton...|$|R
50|$|A {{reaction}} wheel (<b>RW)</b> is a <b>type</b> of flywheel used primarily by spacecraft for attitude control without using fuel for rockets or other reaction devices. They are particularly useful when the spacecraft must be rotated by very small amounts, such as keeping a telescope {{pointed at a}} star. They may also reduce the mass fraction needed for fuel. This is accomplished by equipping the spacecraft {{with an electric motor}} attached to a flywheel which, when its rotation speed is changed, causes the spacecraft to begin to counter-rotate proportionately through conservation of angular momentum. Reaction wheels can rotate a spacecraft only around its center of mass (see torque); they are not capable of moving the spacecraft {{from one place to another}} (see translational force). Reaction wheels work around a nominal zero rotation speed. However, external torques on the spacecraft may require a gradual buildup of {{reaction wheel}} rotation speed to maintain the spacecraft in a fixed orientation.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{comparisons}} of benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) sampling protocols {{have shown that}} samples collected from different habitat types generally produce consistent stream classifications and assessments. However, these comparisons usually have not included biological endpoints used by monitoring agencies, such as multimetric indices (e. g., benthic index of biotic integrity [B-IBI]) or observedto-expected (O/E) indices of taxonomic completeness, as target variables, and estimates of method precision are rarely provided. Targeted-riffle (TR) and reach-wide (RW) benthic samples have been collected at thousands of sites across the western USA, but little guidance is available for understanding 1) {{the extent to which}} raw data sets can be combined in regional or large-scale analyses, 2) the degree of precision afforded by each method, or 3) the efficacy of cross-application of biological indicators derived from one sample type to the other. To address these issues, we used data from 193 sites in California where the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) collected the 2 samples side by side. We also conducted a separate study wherein 3 replicates of each sample type were collected from 15 streams to estimate minimum detectable difference (MDD) as a measure of each method’s precision. Metrics calculated from TR and RW samples showed similar dose–response relationships to stressors gradients and similar raw scoring ranges. Biological indices (B-IBI, O/E 0, and O/E 50) derived from RW samples were more precise than those derived from TR samples, but precision differences were not substantial. On average, pairwise differences in any index between TR and <b>RW</b> sample <b>types</b> were much less than the MDD associated with either sampling method. We observed a weak but consistent bias toward higher O/E 50 scores from TR samples than from RW samples at the highest elevations and in the largest watersheds. Broad-scale condition assessments were nearly identical when B-IBI and O/E 0 were used as endpoints, and assessments based on O/E 50 were only slightly less similar. Our analyses indicate that raw data sets and biological indicators derived from TR and RW samples may be generally interchangeable when used in ambient biomonitoring program...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Potential {{importance}} of electron cyclotron (EC) wave emission {{in the local}} electron power balance in the steady-state regimes of ITER operation suggested analyzing in more detail the accuracy of calculating the 1 D distribution, over magnetic flux surfaces, of the net radiated power density, PEC(ρ). Recent comparison of numeric codes SNECTR, CYTRAN, CYNEQ and EXACTEC for different electron temperature profiles and average temperatures of relevance for fusion reactor-grade magnetoplasmas, has shown good agreement of results within two different cases: (A) specular reflection in a circular cylinder (SNECTR, EXACTEC) and (B) diffuse reflection in a circular cylinder (SNECTR), and diffuse reflection in any geometry or any reflection in a noncircular toroid (CYTRAN, CYNEQ). These cases were shown to provide, respectively, the lower and upper bounds for PEC(ρ), including that for the modulus of PEC(ρ), inverted in sign in the plasma column periphery. Here we extend this analysis to show the following approximate scaling laws on the example of calculations with tot CYNEQ: (i) new formula for the volume-integrated EC power loss, PEC, which gives a simplest extension of the Trubnikov’s formula, originally suggested for homogeneous electron density ne and temperature Te, {{to the case of}} ne and Te profiles expected for ITER and DEMO; (ii) the normalized profiles, PEC(ρ) / P, for identical normalized temperature profiles, Te(ρ) /, appear to be very close for substantially different volume-averaged temperatures, ; (iii) in the central plasma, profile PEC(ρ) in the case A may be close enough to that in the case B for larger value of wall reflectivity Rw, thus depending on an effective <b>Rw,</b> incorporating the <b>type</b> of reflection (diffusive or specular) and the geometry of the vacuum chamber. 1...|$|R
40|$|Public green {{open space}} is a green open space owned and managed by local {{government}} at city or village {{that is used}} for the general public interest. Phenomenon occuring at the moment is the presence of public green open space which is often utilized by the community of parents, adults, teenagers and children who must be controlled and considered.
