40|$|We empirically {{examine whether}} a major {{government}} {{intervention in the}} small-firm credit market yields significantly better results in markets that are <b>less</b> financially <b>developed.</b> The government intervention that we investigate is SBA-guaranteed lending. The literature on financing small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) suggests that small firms may be exposed to {{a particular type of}} market failure associated with credit rationing. And SMEs in markets that are <b>less</b> financially <b>developed</b> will likely face a greater degree of this market failure. To test our hypothesis, we use the level of bank deposits per capita as our relative measure of financial market development, and we use local market employment rates as our measure of economic performance. After controlling for the appropriate cross-sectional market characteristics, we find that SBA-guaranteed lending has a significantly more (less) positive impact on the average annual level of employment when the local market is <b>relatively</b> <b>less</b> (more) financially <b>developed.</b> This result has important implications for public policy directives concerning where SBA-guaranteed lending should be directed.

The results suggest that banks in Hong Kong operated in a competitive fashion in the loan market during the period 1991 - 2002 with no significant sign of collusion on pricing. The market conduct was largely maintained in subsequent years, despite {{significant changes in the}} operating conditions. While major bank consolidations in 2001 - 2002 have resulted in fewer banks and thus a market more conducive to develop and maintain collusions, interest rate deregulations implemented around the same time has promoted a more competitive environment. The estimation results show that while banks do not appear to have exercised any collusive pricing in either the retail market or the corporate loan market, it is <b>relatively</b> <b>less</b> likely to <b>develop</b> oligopolistic collusions in the corporate loan market than in the local retail market.

40|$|The current {{teaching}} methods in cross-cultural business communication have paid <b>relatively</b> <b>less</b> attention to <b>developing</b> students’ emotional skills in cross-cultural interactions. Prior research, however, suggests that cross-cultural interactions are inherently emotional processes, since they involve {{a considerable amount}} of uncertainty and a potential for misunderstanding. With an attempt to fill this gap, this study aimed to design an easy-to-implement teaching module that brings emotions and emotional awareness more centrally into analysis of cross-cultural business communication, and to empirically asses the effectiveness of this module based on the data collected from students who participated in the process. To this end, we have initiated a collaboration between the business schools of a Hungarian university in Budapest and an American university in Northern California, by utilizing the videoconferencing and screen-capture technologies. The results of the study suggested that the videoconferencing technology could be a viable tool to create real-time interactions between students in different countries in which they can experience, express, and observe emotions. In our video-conferencing sessions, the dynamics that emerged among the students provoked a wide-range of emotions, which helped them learn more about cross-cultural communication as reflected on why they have felt these emotions. Thus, students who participated in the teaching module not only gained a first-hand experience in cross-cultural communication, but also could build on this experience to gain knowledge by reflecting on their observations and emotions...|$|R
