5000|$|The {{mean and}} {{covariance}} representation only gives {{the first two}} moments of an underlying, but otherwise unknown, probability distribution. In {{the case of a}} moving object, the unknown probability distribution might represent the uncertainty of the object's position at a given time. The mean and covariance representation of uncertainty is mathematically convenient because any linear transformation [...] can be applied to a mean vector [...] and covariance matrix [...] as [...] and [...] This linearity property does not hold for moments beyond the first <b>raw</b> <b>moment</b> (the mean) and the second central moment (the covariance), so it is not generally possible to determine the mean and covariance resulting from a nonlinear transformation because the result depends on all the moments, and only the first two are given.|$|E
5000|$|By re-arranging the formula, one can {{see that}} the second moment is {{essentially}} the infinite integral of a constant (here 1). Higher even-powered raw moments will also evaluate to infinity. Odd-powered raw moments, however, are undefined, which is distinctly different from existing with the value of infinity. The odd-powered raw moments are undefined because their values are essentially equivalent to [...] since the two halves of the integral both diverge and have opposite signs. The first <b>raw</b> <b>moment</b> is the mean, which, being odd, does not exist. (See also the discussion above about this.) This in turn means that all of the central moments and standardized moments are undefined, since they are all based on the mean. The variance—which is the second central moment—is likewise non-existent (despite the fact that the raw second moment exists with the value infinity).|$|E
