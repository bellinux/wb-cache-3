5|$|When the {{spacecraft}} was installed atop the Dnepr, launch {{was scheduled to}} occur on 25 February, at 13:57 UTC. Prior to this, a practice countdown was scheduled for 19 February. Several hours before the practice was scheduled to begin ISC Kosmotras announced that the launch had been delayed, {{and as a result}} the practice did not take place. The delay was caused by a concern that the second stage manoeuvring engines did not have a sufficient quantity of <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E
25|$|The C.205 was a single-seat, all-metal, {{monoplane}} fighter, {{intended primarily}} as an interceptor but with ground attack and escort capabilities. The long nose housed the DB605 engine which drove a three-blade, constant-speed metal propeller, {{with the main}} fuel tank situated between the engine and the cockpit. The radiator was located under the centre section of the fuselage beneath the cockpit while the short rear section housed the radio equipment, oxygen cylinder and an 80L (20US gal) <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> tank. The wings were made of light aluminium alloys and steel, having two spars and three sections, housing two additional fuel tanks, and the fully retractable wide-set main undercarriage gear. Apart from the all-metal flaps in the inner wing, all the other control surfaces were metal-framed and fabric-covered. Veltros had self-sealing fuel tanks, an armoured seat, and armoured windscreen as standard. The cramped cockpit possessed a limited field-of-view, but some examples were fitted with a rear-view mirror.|$|E
500|$|Flight 52 {{departed}} Bogotá at 13:10 Eastern Standard Time, {{five minutes}} ahead of schedule, on January 25, 1990. The flight landed at [...] Medellín at 14:04 {{and prepared to}} fly the leg to JFK. At Medellín, the aircraft landed with [...] of fuel. The flight plan filed for the journey to JFK called for [...] of fuel required {{for the trip to}} JFK, [...] for <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel,</b> [...] for alternate fuel, [...] for holding fuel, and [...] of taxi fuel totaling [...] minimum of block fuel. The dispatcher at Medellín ordered a total fuel load of , including [...] of [...] "top off" [...] fuel to raise the aircraft weight to the maximum allowable for the planned departure runway. At Medellín, the captain and dispatcher decided to use another runway and requested an additional [...] of fuel.|$|E

500|$|The wing {{leading edges}} were swept {{back to a}} point inline with the engine nacelles, while the {{trailing}} edges were angled forward slightly. The wing contained two 700L (190US gal) fuel tanks between the inner wing main spars, while {{at the head of}} the main spar the oil coolers were fitted. Between the outer spars, a second pair of <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks were located, carrying an individual capacity of 910L (240US gal) of fuel. The outer trailing edges were formed by the ailerons and flaps, which were met by smooth wing tips which curved forward into the leading edge. The outer leading edge sections were installed in the shape of a curved [...] "strip nosed" [...] rib, which was positioned ahead of the main spar. Most of the interior ribs were not solid, with the exception of the ribs located between the rear main spar and the flaps and ailerons. These were of solid construction, though even they had lightening holes.|$|E
500|$|The NTSB {{investigators}} {{found that the}} weather data that the flight crew received in Medellín was nine to ten hours old. Additionally, the alternate airport on the flight plan, Logan International Airport in Boston, was forecast to be below the safe minima for landing. The NTSB also stated that the flight crew {{should have been more}} aware of these problems and cited these deficiencies as evidence of inadequacies in the dispatch of the airplane. The NTSB also found no evidence that the flight crew ever requested weather information en route or communicated with Avianca dispatchers about their fuel status and intents as other flights did. Flight 52 did not make contact with FAA flight service stations or flight watch en route, and the NTSB was unable to determine why. The flight did not express any concern to ATC about their fuel situation during the first two holding patterns that the flight made. The first indication of worry came at 20:09 when the flight crew inquired about delays at Boston. The NTSB posited that the flight crew might have become confused about the [...] "expect further clearance" [...] (EFC) times they were given. This confusion may have been the reason that the flight continued to hold, burning up its <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> {{to the point where it}} could no longer divert to Boston.|$|E
2500|$|To {{keep them}} {{clear of the}} spray of take-off, each of the Robbe's two [...] BMW IV {{water-cooled}} six cylinder upright inline engines was mounted in pusher configuration high above the wings on vertical faired steel tube N-form struts, the forward inner one particularly sturdy, and with transverse V-strut bracing with its apex on the central, upper fuselage. The engines were cooled with radiators {{in the front of}} the engine cowling and behind shutters controlled from the cockpit. There was a <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> tank above each engine.|$|E
50|$|The {{final stage}} of the rocket Delta failed to {{separate}} from the spacecraft, which did not achieve its assigned geostationary orbit. Plans were to use {{up some of the}} <b>reserved</b> <b>fuel,</b> which will entail a reduced operational lifetime (4.5 years). Equipped with a Star 30 solid apogee motor. Carries 625 kg of fuel for the apogee motor and 187 kg of hydrazine propellant.|$|R

50|$|On 6 June 2011, a SkyWest Airlines Canadair CRJ-200, flight OO 4443 (code share DL 443) from Cincinnati to Milwaukee couldn't extend right main {{landing gear}}; however, left {{main landing gear}} was {{extended}} and locked. After several failed attempts to extend the right main landing and running low on <b>reserved</b> <b>fuel,</b> airplane landed with right main gear up on runway 19R.

2500|$|May was {{hampered}} by the Jaguar's limited fuel range and an unreliable petrol gauge which caused him to make frequent filling station stops {{out of fear of}} running out of fuel. Hammond had attempted to prolong his fuel stops to the very last possible moment by employing the Vincent's <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> tank. This backfired after his fuel stop [...] south of Doncaster, as Hammond was forced to pull over in the rain after breaking down. Having failed to close the reserve tank tap, sludge from the fuel tank had entered the fuel lines and blocked the left hand carburettor.|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Aircraft Factory {{conducted}} spinning {{tests on}} the type, concluding that the R.E.8 was quite hard to spin and recovered easily; but the fin was redesigned with slightly increased area to improve spin recovery. [...] The modification resulted in the production version being no less stable than the B.E.2e; and while this was an advantage for artillery observation and photography it gave the R.E.8 little chance to out-manoeuvre enemy fighters. A larger fin was fitted to some R.E.8s used as trainers. Some pilots flew the R.E.8 with an empty <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> tank (or even filled the tank with fire extinguisher fluid) to avoid a perceived tendency of R.E.8s to burn on crashing. None of these measures {{would have made the}} aircraft any [...] "safer", if the problem was one of poor stalling characteristics. Several pilots who flew the type mentioned that they had no problems but were careful to keep the airspeed well above stalling point.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{destination}} is positioned so that less <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> {{is needed for}} a flight from the origin to the initial destination than for a flight from the origin to the final destination. Under normal circumstances, little {{if any of the}} <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> is actually used, so when the aircraft reaches the reclear fix it still has (almost) all the original <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> on board, which is enough to cover the flight from the reclear fix to the final destination.|$|E
50|$|A {{launch of}} the Atlas V rocket on March 22, 2016 had a minor first-stage anomaly that led to {{shutdown}} of the first-stage engine approximately five seconds before anticipated. The anomaly forced the Centaur upper stage of the rocket to fire for approximately one minute longer than planned, using <b>reserved</b> <b>fuel</b> margin. The preplanned deorbit burn successfully deorbited the stage, but not precisely within the designated location. The anomaly marks the first Atlas V anomaly in over eight years to be publicly acknowledged by ULA.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to standard fuel needs, some organizations require that a flight plan include <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> if certain conditions are met. For example, an over-water flight of {{longer than a}} specific duration may require the flight plan to include <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel.</b> The <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> may be planned as extra which is left over on the aircraft at the destination, {{or it may be}} assumed to be burned during flight (perhaps due to unaccounted for differences between the actual aircraft and the flight performance data).|$|E
50|$|In July 1988 Walpole was {{grounded}} by British Airways for {{landing a}} transatlantic Concorde at Heathrow with 25 minutes of <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> remaining, instead of 30 minutes of <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel.</b> Walpole {{had the option}} to divert to Shannon airport to refuel, but had not done so.|$|E
50|$|Some {{iteration}} {{is generally}} required {{due to the}} need to calculate interdependent values. For instance, <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> is often calculated as a percentage of trip fuel, but trip fuel cannot be calculated until the total weight of the aircraft is known, and this includes the weight of the <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 23 March 2016 (UTC), Cygnus CRS OA-6 was {{successfully}} {{launched by the}} Atlas V into Low Earth orbit. During the flight, the rocket had a first-stage anomaly that led to shutdown of the first-stage engine approximately five seconds before anticipated. The anomaly forced the Centaur upper stage of the rocket to fire for approximately one minute longer than planned, using <b>reserved</b> <b>fuel</b> margin, but did not significantly impact payload orbital insertion. The preplanned deorbit burn successfully deorbited the stage, but not precisely within the designated location. The issue marked the first Atlas V anomaly in over eight years to be publicly acknowledged by ULA.|$|R

50|$|From an accountant's viewpoint, the {{provision}} of <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> costs money (the fuel needed to carry the hopefully unused <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel).</b> Techniques known variously as reclear, redispatch, or decision point procedure have been developed, which can greatly {{reduce the amount of}} <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> needed while still maintaining all required safety standards. These techniques are based on having some specified intermediate airport to which the flight can divert if necessary; in practice such diversions are rare. The use of such techniques can save several tons of fuel on long flights, or it can increase the payload carried by a similar amount.|$|E
50|$|One factor {{identified}} by Arthur and Rose that helps achieve the maximum possible saving {{is to have}} an initial destination positioned so that descent to the initial destination starts immediately after the reclear fix. This is beneficial because it minimises the <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> needed between reclear fix and initial destination, and hence maximises the amount of <b>reserve</b> <b>fuel</b> available at the reclear fix.|$|E

SpaceX successful recovery of a first stage rocket in December 2015 has not changed the Arianespace outlook. Arianespace CEO Israel stated that the [...] "challenges of reusability ... have not disappeared. ...
