2500|$|Radium, like radon, is a {{radioactive}} element {{and it is}} found in small quantities in nature and may thus be hazardous to life if concentrated. Radium has its origins as a decay product of certain isotopes of uranium and thorium. [...] Radium may also be released to the environment {{as a result of}} human activity, for example, in inproperly discarded products painted with <b>radioluminescent</b> <b>paint.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The beta {{particles}} {{emitted by}} the radioactive decay of {{small amounts of}} tritium cause chemicals called phosphors to glow. [...] This radioluminescence is used in self-powered lighting devices called betalights, which are used for night illumination of firearm sights, watches, exit signs, map lights, knives {{and a variety of}} other devices. [...] Tritium has replaced <b>radioluminescent</b> <b>paint</b> containing radium in this application, which can cause bone cancer and has been banned in most countries for decades. As of the turn of the millennium, commercial demand for tritium is 400grams per year and the cost is approximately US$30,000 per gram.|$|E
2500|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1914 in New York City, by Dr. Sabin Arnold von Sochocky and Dr. George S. Willis, as the Radium Luminous Material Corporation. The company {{produced}} uranium from carnotite ore and eventually moved {{into the business of}} producing <b>radioluminescent</b> <b>paint,</b> and then to the application of that paint. Over the next several years, it opened facilities in Newark, Jersey City, and Orange. In August 1921, von Sochocky was forced from the presidency, and the company was renamed the United States Radium Corporation. In Orange, where radium was extracted from 1917 to 1926, the U.S. Radium facility processed half a ton of ore per day. The ore was obtained from [...] "Undark mines" [...] in Paradox Valley, Colorado and in Utah.|$|E

50|$|Because {{of safety}} {{concerns}} and tighter regulation, consumer {{products such as}} clocks and watches now increasingly use phosphorescent rather than radioluminescent substances. <b>Radioluminescent</b> <b>paint</b> may still be preferred in specialist applications, such as diving watches.|$|E
50|$|Since {{radioactivity}} {{was discovered}} {{around the turn}} of the 20th century, the main application of radioluminescence has been in <b>radioluminescent</b> <b>paint,</b> used on watch and compass dials, gunsights, aircraft flight instrument faces, and other instruments, to allow them to be seen in the dark. <b>Radioluminescent</b> <b>paint</b> consists of a mixture of a chemical containing a radioisotope with a radioluminescent chemical (phosphor). The continuous radioactive decay of the isotope's atoms releases radiation particles which strike the molecules of the phosphor, causing them to give off light. The constant bombardment by radioactive particles causes the chemical breakdown of many types of phosphor, so radioluminescent paints lose some of their luminosity over their working life.|$|E
5000|$|Radium dials are watch, {{clock and}} other {{instrument}} dials painted with <b>radioluminescent</b> <b>paint</b> containing radium-226. Radium dial production peaked {{in the first}} decade of the Twentieth Century as radiation poisoning was then unknown; subsequently, radium dials have largely been replaced by phosphorescent- or occasionally tritium-based light sources.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Radioluminescent</b> <b>paint</b> {{contains}} a radioactive isotope (radionuclide) {{combined with a}} radioluminescent substance. The isotopes selected are typically strong emitters of fast electrons (beta radiation), preferred since this radiation will not penetrate an enclosure. Radioluminescent paints will glow without exposure to light until the radioactive isotope has decayed (or the phosphor degrades), which may be many years. They are therefore {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "self-luminous".|$|E

5000|$|This type {{of paint}} {{has been used}} to mark escape paths in {{aircraft}} and for decorative use such as [...] "stars" [...] applied to walls and ceilings. It is an alternative to <b>radioluminescent</b> <b>paint.</b> Kenner's Lightning Bug Glo-Juice was a popular non-toxic paint product in 1968, marketed at children, alongside other glow-in-the-dark toys and novelties. Phosphorescent paint is typically used as body paint, on childrens' walls and outdoors.|$|E
50|$|Radioluminescence is the {{phenomenon}} by which light {{is produced in}} a material by bombardment with ionizing radiation such as alpha particles, beta particles, or gamma rays. Radioluminescence {{is used as a}} low level light source for night illumination of instruments or signage or other applications where light must be produced for long periods without external energy sources. <b>Radioluminescent</b> <b>paint</b> used to be used for clock hands and instrument dials, enabling them to be read in the dark. Radioluminescence is also sometimes seen around high-power radiation sources, such as nuclear reactors and radioisotopes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Radioluminescent</b> <b>paint</b> {{was invented}} in 1908 and {{originally}} incorporated radium-226. The toxicity of radium was not initially understood, and radium-based paint saw widespread use in, for example, watches and aircraft instruments. During the 1920s and 1930s, {{the harmful effects of}} this paint became increasingly clear. A notorious case involved the [...] "Radium Girls", a group of women who painted watchfaces and later suffered adverse health effects from ingestion. It is now recognised that radium paint requires great care in application, maintenance and disposal to avoid creation of a hazardous condition.|$|E
50|$|The Radium Dial Company, {{was one of}} a few {{now defunct}} United States {{companies}} along with the United States Radium Corporation, involved in the painting of clocks, watches and other instrument dials using <b>radioluminescent</b> <b>paint</b> containing radium. The resulting dials are now collectively known as radium dials. The luminous paint used on the dials contained a mixture of phosphorus and radium, a product that the Radium Dial Company named Luna. However, unlike the US Radium Corporation, Radium Dial Company was specifically set up to only paint dials, no other radium processing took place at the premises.|$|E
