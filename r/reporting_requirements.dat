5|$|As Speaker, Hastert shepherded the USA Patriot Act in October 2001 to {{passage in}} the House on a 357-66 vote. In a 2011 interview, Hastert claimed credit for its passage over the misgivings of many members. Fourteen years later, federal {{prosecutors}} used the Patriot Act's expansion of currency transaction <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements</b> to indict Hastert on federal charges.|$|E
5|$|In May 2015, Hastert {{was indicted}} on federal charges of {{structuring}} bank withdrawals to evade bank <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements</b> and {{making false statements}} to federal investigators. Federal prosecutors said that the money was to compensate for and conceal deliberately unspecified misconduct by Hastert against an unnamed individual years earlier. Soon afterward, public accusations emerged that Hastert had sexually abused three male students (including the aforementioned unnamed individual) {{when he was a}} teacher more than three decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., {{airports}} {{are required to}} obtain stormwater discharge permits and ensure that wastes from deicing operations are properly collected and treated. Large new airports {{may be required to}} collect 60 percent of aircraft deicing fluid after deicing. Airports that discharge the collected aircraft deicing fluid directly to waters of the U.S. must also meet numeric discharge requirements for chemical oxygen demand. A report in 2000 stated that ethylene glycol was becoming less popular for aircraft deicing in the U.S., due to its <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements</b> and adverse environmental impacts (p.213), and noted a shift to the use of propylene glycol (p.I-3).|$|E

5|$|Like Profit making organisations, nonprofits {{and governments}} will produce Consolidated Financial Statements. These are {{generated}} {{in line with}} the <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements</b> in the country they are based or if they are large enough they may produce them under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), an example of this is the UK based charity Oxfam. If the organisation is small it may use a cash basis accounting but larger ones generally use accrual basis accounting for their funds.|$|E
5|$|Nonprofit {{organizations}} {{and government agencies}} have special requirements to show, in financial statements and reports, how money is spent, rather than how much profit was earned. Unlike profit oriented businesses, which use a single set of self-balancing accounts (or general ledger), nonprofits can {{have more than one}} general ledger (or fund), depending on their financial <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements.</b> An accountant for such an entity must be able to produce reports detailing the expenditures and revenues for each of the organization's individual funds, and reports that summarize the organization's financial activities across all of its funds.|$|E
5|$|Patrick Henry College was {{incorporated}} in 1998 by Michael Farris, {{founder and chairman}} of the board of the Home School Legal Defense Association, with which PHC is still closely connected. It officially opened September 20, 2000, with a class of 92 students. The college eschews federal financial aid and is therefore relieved from Department of Education <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements</b> on demographic makeup and other information. The school does not ask for race on applications.|$|E
50|$|The Ethics Commission issues {{advisory}} {{opinions and}} letter rulings to covered individuals or others asking whether a proposed course of conduct would violate Amendment 41 {{or any other}} ethical standard of conduct or <b>reporting</b> <b>requirement.</b> The Ethics Commission is also required to investigate and hold a hearing on all non-frivolous complaints alleging violations of the gift ban, the anti-revolving door provision, or any other standard of conduct or <b>reporting</b> <b>requirement</b> in state law.|$|R

5|$|An example {{may be a}} {{local school}} system in the United States. It {{receives}} {{a grant from the}} its local state government to support a new special education initiative, another grant from the federal government for a school lunch program, and an annuity to award teachers working on research projects. At periodic intervals, the school system needs to generate a report to the state about the special education program, a report to a federal agency about the school lunch program, and a report to another authority about the research program. Each of these programs has its own unique <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements,</b> so the school system needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures. This is done by establishing separate funds, each with its own chart of accounts.|$|E
5|$|Elemental bromine is toxic {{and causes}} {{chemical}} burns on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure {{may lead to}} frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States has set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 0.1ppm and a short-term limit of 0.3ppm. The exposure to bromine immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 3ppm. Bromine is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict <b>reporting</b> <b>requirements</b> by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E

Part VI then considers what the data now publicly reported under the Civil Justice Reform Act does, and does not, tell us about federal judges and the federal district courts...|$|R

30|$|In 2002, {{mainland}} {{changed its}} reporting frequency from semi-annually since inception in 1993 to quarterly. For dual-listed AH shares companies in mainland and Hong Kong, {{even though they}} file financial reports semi-annually to SEHK, investors in Hong Kong would have access to more information as these companies also issue quarterly reports in A share market. We compare two groups of Chinese stocks listed in SEHK, pure H shares of Chinese companies (H share) and the H-tranche of A-H dual-listed Chinese companies (AH share). The former group follows HK <b>reporting</b> <b>requirement</b> to have semi-annual reporting. The latter group is dual-listed both in mainland and Hong Kong. The A-tranche of these AH shares follows Chinese <b>reporting</b> <b>requirement</b> since 2002 to have quarterly reporting. As such, we can avoid the two problems mentioned above.|$|R
