5000|$|LED tubes {{based on}} <b>Retro-Fit</b> design can {{typically}} {{be installed in}} place of former fluorescent tubes in compatible luminaires as they are, with consideration of manufacturer and lamp-specific restrictions. Some models are only compatible with magnetic ballasts, but models that can be installed in any old fluorescent tube luminaire are also available on the market. In some <b>Retro-Fit</b> LED tubes, a special LED starter is used {{in place of the}} fluorescent lamp starter. Re-introduction of fluorescent lamps is still possible merely by lamp and starter replacement. If used in luminaires equipped with compensation capacitors, LED tubes often generate a lot of reactive power. Most LED tubes based on <b>Retro-Fit</b> design are manufactured according to the LED tube standard EN62776.|$|E

5000|$|... 1st {{generation}} of <b>Retro-Fit</b> LED tubesSo-called 1st generation <b>Retro-Fit</b> LED tubes were introduced {{on the market}} between 2005 and 2010, and not much attention was paid on quality or safety. In 2010, European safety authorities, including the Finnish Safety and Chemicals Agency, ruled {{that the risk of}} electricity flowing through a LED tube during the installation stage should be avoided. This refers to a situation where one end of a LED tube is connected to the luminaire and the other, free end becomes energized. The ruling resulted in numerous sales bans and product recalls. Products complying with 1st generation electrical connection are still available on the market.|$|E
50|$|In principle, {{anyone can}} replace a LED tube. In case of {{products}} {{based on the}} <b>Retro-Fit</b> installation approach, LED tubes contain all the electronics required, which means that {{in the event of}} LED tube failure, replacement or even fluorescent tube reinstallation is simple.|$|E

50|$|After the Hartley Colliery Disaster in 1862, mine {{owners were}} {{compelled}} to improve mine ventilation. Ventilation was now required to include separate shafts for down-cast and up-cast airflow, and for ventilation {{to be provided}} by fans rather than the older furnace system. This encouraged sales of ventilation fans, particularly the Waddle. As the fan impeller formed its own shroud, it required little additional installation and so was relatively easy to <b>retro-fit</b> to an existing pithead.|$|E
50|$|In 2009 Rolls-Royce {{introduced}} an upgraded {{version of the}} engine dubbed the Trent 700EP (enhanced performance) which incorporated a package of improvements derived from later members of the Trent engine family (especially the Trent 1000). These included elliptical leading edges and optimised fan and high-pressure turbine tip clearances. Together the improvements provided a 1.2% improvement to the Trent 700's specific fuel consumption. Some of the improvements were also made available as a <b>retro-fit</b> kit to existing airlines.|$|E

50|$|One locomotive, No. 37395, was {{modified}} from being coal to oil-fired in 2002, another has been modified and the Railway {{is looking to}} <b>retro-fit</b> further locomotives to oil-firing. Conversion to an oil-fired system {{has the potential to}} reduce the danger of forest fires that could be caused by ashes flying out from the locomotive. Additionally, the effort involved in the manual lifting of coal and putting it into the boiler is eliminated. The current oil-fired locomotives need only one fireman to accompany the driver, while coal-fired engines need two firemen.|$|E
5000|$|LED tubes {{that are}} only {{available}} {{as part of a}} dedicated lighting fixture. The package may also include control electronics that are external to the LED tube, and the LED tubes do not comply with the LED tube standard EN 62776. <b>Retro-fit</b> LED tubes (installation method 1 above) can also often be installed in fixtures designed for LED tubes. In these cases, the fixture typically only acts as a frame or holder to the tube, and electricity supply to the tubes uses the conductors in the fixture. The LED tube may also be compliant with standard EN 62776.|$|E
5000|$|... 2nd {{generation}} of <b>Retro-Fit</b> LED tubesThe second {{generation of}} LED tubes became commonplace (especially in Nordic countries) immediately after the safety ruling of 2010.In second-generation LED tubes, the risk of installation-related electric shocks that plagued the 1st generation was resolved by {{a new type of}} electrical connection. The connection differs from that of the 1st generation by that it utilises the starter wire present in luminaires for the conveyance of electricity through the luminaire {{to the other end of}} the tube. In most cases, the solution replaces the starter by a special LED starter that short-circuits the starter branch.|$|E

5000|$|... 4th {{generation}} of <b>Retro-Fit</b> LED tubes The 4th {{generation of}} LED tubes focuses on solving well-being related issues of general lighting. Recently, several studies aimed at flickering of electric lights have been conducted. According to these studies, the flickering of traditional fluorescent lamps can cause brain stress and anxiety. The 4th generation of LED tubes offers {{a solution to}} the flickering problem. The flickering is measured using so-called flicker index or flicker percentage value. Elimination of flickering allows high-quality video recording and slow motion capture, as well as certain machine vision applications in premises equipped with flicker-free lights.|$|E
50|$|A {{principal}} {{barrier to}} the adoption of self-service is often technological: it may not always be feasible or economically viable to <b>retro-fit</b> new interfaces onto existing systems. Moreover, organisations may wish to layer a variable and configurable set of process rules on top of the system interfaces which may vary according to market offerings and the type of customer. This only adds to the cost and complexity of the technological implementation. Robotic automation software provides a pragmatic means of deploying new services in this situation, where the robots simply mimick the behaviour of humans to perform the back end transcription or processing. The relative affordability of this approach arises from the fact that no IT new transformation or investment is required; instead the software robots simply leverage greater use out of existing IT assets.|$|E
50|$|LEDs {{were invented}} in 1927 by the Russian {{scientist}} Oleg Losev, and were revived in 1961 {{to be used}} in calculators. The LED market has grown exponentially in different segments of the market. From the automotive to the aviation industry the potential of LED is infinite. This trend has continued to the consumer lighting market in 1993 after several years of research bringing white LED to homes and the professional markets. Peter Shen recognized this opportunity and created Foreverlamp in 2010 to provide energy efficient LED lighting for both the consumer and professional market.In collaboration with Alessi, Foreverlamp introduced its first collection in 2011 of Design Light Bulbs and Luminaires under the name AlessiLux. Simultaneously a range of <b>retro-fit</b> LED lighting products under its own brand name was marketed. In 2012 the AlessiLux portable range was introduced for flexible lighting solutions.|$|E
