5|$|<b>Refined</b> <b>sugar</b> is {{made from}} raw sugar that has {{undergone}} a refining process to remove the molasses. Raw sugar is sucrose which is extracted from sugarcane or sugar beet. While raw sugar can be consumed, the refining process removes unwanted tastes and results in <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> or white sugar.|$|E
5|$|<b>Refined</b> <b>sugar</b> {{is widely}} used for {{industrial}} needs for higher quality. <b>Refined</b> <b>sugar</b> is purer (ICUMSA below 300) than raw sugar (ICUMSA over 1,500). The level of purity associated with the colors of sugar, expressed by standard number ICUMSA, the smaller ICUMSA numbers indicate the higher purity of sugar.|$|E
5|$|The International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis sets {{standards}} for the measurement of the purity of <b>refined</b> <b>sugar,</b> known as ICUMSA numbers; lower numbers indicate {{a higher level of}} purity in the <b>refined</b> <b>sugar.</b>|$|E

25|$|Nosemosis {{can also}} be {{prevented}} or minimized by removing much of the honey from the beehive, then feeding the bees on sugar water in the late fall. Sugar water made from <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> has lower ash content than flower nectar, {{reducing the risk of}} dysentery. <b>Refined</b> <b>sugar,</b> however, contains fewer nutrients than natural honey, which causes some controversy among beekeepers.|$|E
25|$|As the glycemic index {{measures}} {{the speed at}} which glucose is released into the bloodstream a <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> containing glucose is considered high-glycemic. As with other sugars, over-consumption may cause an increase in blood sugar levels from a normal 90mg/dL to up over 150mg/dL. (5mmol/l to over 8.3mmol/l).|$|E
25|$|<b>Refined</b> <b>sugar</b> was {{a luxury}} before the 18th century. It became widely {{popular in the}} 18th century, then {{graduated}} to becoming a necessary food in the 19th century. This evolution of taste and demand for sugar as an essential food ingredient unleashed major economic and social changes. Eventually, table sugar became sufficiently cheap and common enough to influence standard cuisine and flavored drinks.|$|E

40|$|The high {{intake of}} <b>refined</b> <b>sugars,</b> mainly {{fructose}} has {{been implicated in}} the epidemiology of metabolic diseases in adults and children. With an aim to determine whether honey can substitute <b>refined</b> <b>sugars</b> without adverse effect, {{the long-term effects of}} natural honey and cane syrup have been compared on visceral morphology in growing rats fed from neonatal age. Honey increased the caecum and pancreas weights in male rats, which could enhance enzymatic activities of pancreas and digestive functions by intestinal microflora of caecum. Unlike honey, cane syrup caused fatty degenerations in the liver of both male and female rats. Honey enhanced intestinal villi growth, and did not cause pathology in the rodents’ abdominal viscera, suggesting potential nutritional benefit as substitution for <b>refined</b> <b>sugars</b> in animal feed. Part of work was accepted for oral presentation as an abstract titled "Comarative effects of honey and sugar on the morphometry of viscera in growing Sprague-Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus) " at the 31 Scientific Conference, Physiological Society of Nigeria (PSN) held at Usmanu Dan Fodiyo University Teaching Hospital (UDUTH), Sokoto, Nigeria during 7 - 9 September, 2011.

25|$|Water {{was always}} a serious concern for {{plantation}} managers and owners. In the early 20th century, it took one ton of water to produce one pound of <b>refined</b> <b>sugar.</b> This inefficient use of water and the relative lack of fresh water in the island environment were fiercely compounding environmental degradation. Sugar processing places significant demands on resources including irrigation, coal, iron, wood, steam, and railroads for transportation.|$|E
25|$|Brown sugar comes {{either from}} the late stages of cane sugar refining, when sugar forms fine {{crystals}} with significant molasses content, or from coating white <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> with a cane molasses syrup (blackstrap molasses). Brown sugar's color and taste becomes stronger with increasing molasses content, as do its moisture-retaining properties. Brown sugars also tend to harden if exposed to the atmosphere, although proper handling can reverse this.|$|E
25|$|Further, {{either a}} change in pH balance or {{introduction}} of foreign bacteria in the vagina can lead to infectious vaginitis. Physical factors that have been claimed {{to contribute to the}} development of infections include the following: constantly wet vulva due to tight clothing, chemicals coming in contact with the vagina via scented tampons, antibiotics, birth control pills, or a diet favoring <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> and yeast.|$|E
50|$|His {{connection}} with the sugar industry dates back to 1891, when he met the engineer Luis Torrosella, which had obtained the concession to <b>refine</b> <b>sugar</b> in Uruguay, and French Félix Giraud, who settled in Montevideo's first sugar refinery, called Eastern Refinery.|$|R
50|$|Payen also {{developed}} processes for <b>refining</b> <b>sugar,</b> {{along with a}} way to refine starch and alcohol from potatoes, and a method for determination of nitrogen. Payen invented a decolorimeter, which dealt with the analysis, decolorization, bleaching, and crystallization of sugar.|$|R
50|$|It {{was home}} of James Gardner, whose {{experience}} <b>sugar</b> <b>refining</b> from <b>sugar</b> cane in Hawaii, who first successfully boiled sugar from sugar beets in Utah in 1891, {{working for the}} Utah Sugar Company.|$|R
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to distinguish between fully <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> produced from beet and cane. One way is by isotope analysis of carbon. Cane uses C4 carbon fixation, and beet uses C3 carbon fixation, resulting in a different ratio of 13C and 12C isotopes in the sucrose. Tests are used to detect fraudulent abuse of European Union subsidies or {{to aid in the}} detection of adulterated fruit juice.|$|E
25|$|Tooth decay {{has been}} present {{throughout}} human history, from early hominids {{millions of years}} ago, to modern humans. The prevalence of caries increased dramatically in the 19th century, as the Industrial Revolution made certain items, such as <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> and flour, readily available. The diet of the “newly industrialized English working class” then became centered on bread, jam, and sweetened tea, greatly increasing both sugar consumption and caries.|$|E
25|$|Another {{significant}} {{change to the}} oral environment occurred during the Industrial Revolution. More efficient refinement and manufacturing of foodstuffs increased the availability and amount of sucrose consumed by humans. This provided S. mutans with more energy resources, and thus exacerbated an already rising rate of dental caries. <b>Refined</b> <b>sugar</b> is pure sucrose, the only sugar that {{can be converted to}} sticky glucans, allowing bacteria to form a thick, strongly adhering plaque.|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} {{specific}} factors {{that should be}} considered in foods that can indicate their glycemic index. Low glycemic foods contain fat, protein, fiber, whole grains, raw starches, legumes, vegetables, fruits and dairy products. High glycemic foods contain <b>refined</b> grains, <b>refined</b> <b>sugars,</b> and increased amylopectin/amylose ratio.|$|R

25|$|White refined is {{the most}} common form of sugar in North America and Europe. <b>Refined</b> <b>sugar</b> is made by {{dissolving}} and purifying raw sugar using phosphoric acid similar to the method used for blanco directo, a carbonatation process involving calcium hydroxide and carbon dioxide, or by various filtration strategies. It is then further purified by filtration through a bed of activated carbon or bone char. Beet sugar refineries produce refined white sugar directly without an intermediate raw stage.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{substances}} {{are often}} called 'pure' {{to set them}} apart from mixtures. A common example of a chemical substance is pure water; {{it has the same}} properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated from a river or made in a laboratory. Other chemical substances commonly encountered in pure form are diamond (carbon), gold, table salt (sodium chloride) and <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> (sucrose). However, in practice, no substance is entirely pure, and chemical purity is specified according to the intended use of the chemical.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally {{prepared}} {{soul food}} is often high in fat, sodium, and starch. Highly {{suited to the}} physically demanding lives of laborers, farmhands and rural lifestyles generally, {{it is now a}} contributing factor to obesity, heart disease, and diabetes in a population that has become increasingly more urban and sedentary. As a result, more health-conscious African Americans are using alternative methods of preparation, eschewing trans fats in favor of natural vegetable oils and substituting smoked turkey for fatback and other, cured pork products; limiting the amount of <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> in desserts; and emphasizing the consumption of more fruits and vegetables than animal protein. There is some resistance to such changes, however, as they involve deviating from long culinary tradition.|$|E
