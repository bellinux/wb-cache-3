40|$|Little {{verification}} of hydrologic forecasts {{has been conducted}} to date, and therefore {{little is known about}} the skill of hydrologic forecasts. This dissertation presents a verification study of river <b>stage</b> <b>forecasts</b> with lead-times up to three days for sixteen locations in the United States for a period spanning the past decade. The verification metrics from this limited sample indicate that the below flood <b>stage</b> <b>forecasts</b> are skillful, and so are the day 1 above flood <b>stage</b> <b>forecasts.</b> However, by day 3, the longer lead-time, above flood <b>stage</b> <b>forecasts</b> appear to have little skill (when compared with simple persistence). Further, they have not improved during the period of record despite a number of forecast process improvements. A path to improving the forecasts is suggested, via a new approach to selecting enhancements to the hydrologic forecast process. In support of this method, two fundamental building blocks of a robust verification program are presented: a method to pinpoint sources of skill in forecasts, and a standardized process for verifying forecasts. One element of a complete verification system is a process to determine why forecasts behave as they do. Forecasters need to be able to determine what causes a forecast to be good and what causes it to be bad. Therefore, an operationally implementable method for conducting this type of verification analysis is described and demonstrated. The method is used to evaluate the influence of model calibration, model initial conditions, and precipitation forecasts on the skill of single-valued (deterministic) river forecasts. A second important element of any forecast process, is a well defined, standard verification methodology. This dissertation proposes a standard verification system for deterministic river forecasts as a foundation for future discussions and for development of a well accepted set of verification practices for hydrologic forecasts. The proposed standards account for the needs of users, forecasters, scientists and administrators and are designed to be easily implemented within the constraints of an operational system...|$|R

40|$|A new {{software}} system {{for assessing the}} uncertainty in short term river <b>stage</b> <b>forecasts</b> has been developed at the Office of Hydrologic Development (OHD) of the National Weather Service (NWS). This method explicitly accounts for the uncertainty in the future precipitation and temperature conditions, {{a major portion of}} the uncertainty in the river <b>stage</b> <b>forecasts.</b> The method requires deriving a forecast distribution from a given deterministic forecast using the joint distribution of historical forecasts and observations. Once the forecast distribution is known, the climatological distribution is mapped into the new forecast distribution to create ensembles of precipitation and ensembles of temperature. The existing Ensemble Streamflow Prediction technique within the NWS River Forecast System (NWSRFS) is used to generate stream flow ensembles from the precipitation and temperature ensembles.

40|$|Analysis of {{forecasts}} {{obtained by}} a forecasting {{model of the}} Muskingum type for real-time application, called STAFOM, shows that the model provides accurate <b>forecast</b> <b>stage</b> estimates {{for most of the}} selected case studies and flood events in the Upper-Middle Tiber River basin in Central Italy. However, three main issues affected STAFOM and in particular a) its kinematic nature, b) the lateral inflows representation and, finally, c) the occurrence of sudden fluctuations in water levels observed at the ends of the equipped river reach. Therefore, this simple <b>stage</b> <b>forecasting</b> model is here improved by incorporating a methodology relating local stage and remote discharge along river channels. This latter procedure, based on the Rating Curve Model (RCM), is capable of reconstructing discharge hydrograph at a river site where only stage is monitored, while the discharge is recorded at another section located far away and for which a significant lateral inflow contribution is expected. Application of the new model, named STAFOM-RCM, to several flood events that occurred along four equipped river reaches of the Upper Tiber River basin, shows that it improves the <b>stage</b> <b>forecast</b> accuracy both in terms of peak and stage hydrograph mainly for long river reaches, thus allowing to consider a longer forecast lead-time and hence avoiding the use of the old two-connecting river branch scheme which amplified the fluctuations in observed water levels...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the application of}} the multi-temporal approach of the Model Conditional Processor (MCP-MT) for predictive uncertainty (PU) estimation in the Godavari River basin, India. MCP-MT is developed for making probabilistic Bayesian decision. It is the most appropriate approach if the uncertainty of future outcomes is to be considered. It yields the best predictive density of future events and allows determining the probability that a critical warning threshold may be exceeded within a given forecast time. In Bayesian decision-making, the predictive density re{{presents the}} best available knowledge on a future event to address a rational decision-making process. MCP-MT has already been tested for case studies selected in Italian river basins, showing evidence of improvement of the effectiveness of operative real-time flood forecasting systems. The application of MCP-MT for two river reaches selected in the Godavari River basin, India, is here presented and discussed by considering the <b>stage</b> <b>forecasts</b> provided by a deterministic model, STAFOM-RCM, and hourly dataset based on seven monsoon seasons in the period 2001 – 2010. The results show that the PU estimate is useful for finding the exceedance probability for a given hydrometric threshold as function of the forecast time up to 24 h, demonstrating the potential usefulness for supporting real-time decision-making. Moreover, the expected value provided by MCP-MT yields better results than the deterministic model predictions, with higher Nash–Sutcliffe coefficients and lower error on <b>stage</b> <b>forecasts,</b> both in term of mean error and standard deviation and root mean square error...|$|R

The hybrid models are wavelet packet-based {{artificial neural network}} (WPANN) and wavelet packet-based adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (WPANFIS). Wavelet packet decomposition splits an input time series into approximation and detail components, and the decomposed time series are used as inputs to artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for WPANN and WPANFIS models, respectively.

The inputs used include clear sky irradiation and forecasting weather type for the forecast days. In [31] the historical power output is classified into several weather types using forecast irradiation, total cloud and low cloud cover as parameters selection; the authors uses RBFNN as a technique to produce PV Power forecasts with 24 -h ahead horizon. In [12] forecasts of high, medium and low temperatures are used to classify historical PV power output into three weather types. After that, three feed forward neural networks (FFNN) were employed to generate 24 -h ahead forecasts. In [35], the authors present a hybrid method to forecast 1 -day ahead PV power output; the proposed method comprises three stages: data classification stage, training <b>stage</b> and <b>forecasting</b> <b>stage.</b> The classification stage is developed using self organizing map (SOM) and learning vector quantization (LVQ); {{the objective is to}} classify the historical PV power data into five weather types according to the verbal weather forecast of the TCWB (Taiwan Center Weather Bureau).

Considering {{the fact that the}} quantitative rainfall forecasting has not been fully developed in all catchment areas in China, the emphasis is given to the hydrologic uncertainty for Bayesian probabilistic forecasting.

These pose severe limitation to its practical application to real-life situations. In this paper, a new prior density and likelihood function model is developed with BP artificial neural network (ANN) to study the hydrologic uncertainty of short-term reservoir <b>stage</b> <b>forecasts</b> based on the BFS framework.
