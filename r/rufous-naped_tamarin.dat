It is {{predominantly}} black and white, with a reddish nape. Diurnal, Geoffroy's tamarin spends most of its time in trees, but does come down to the ground occasionally. It lives in groups that most often number between three and five individuals, and generally include one or more adults of each sex. It eats a variety of foods, including insects, exudates, fruits and other plant parts. Insects and fruits account for the majority of its diet, but exudates are also important. But since its teeth are not adapted for gouging trees to get to the sap, it can only eat exudates when they are easily available.|$|E

However, few experimental field {{studies have been}} conducted to determine causal influences of one primate species on another. In this paper, we describe an experimental field study focused on the effects of mantled howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata) on <b>rufous-naped</b> <b>tamarins</b> (Saguinus geoffroyi). Two juvenile howler monkeys were placed on a small island with 5 tamarins in an A-B- A 2 -B 2 experimental design: A-baseline with no howlers present, B-experimental condition with howlers present, A 2 -second baseline with no howlers, and B 2 -second experimental condition with howlers present. Systematic focal sample data were collected on the tamarins' feeding patterns, their height in the forest, their distance from the nearest howler, the height of the howlers, and agonistic interactions between the two species. The presence of the howlers appeared to slightly decrease the tamarins' rate of feeding on provisioned and natural food. This effect diminished during the second experimental condition. There were few agonistic interactions between the species and no wounding or deterioration in the condition of either species was observed. The tamarins shifted early morning and mid-day feeding patterns later when the howlers were present. There was a faint tendency for the tamarins to be higher in the trees when the howlers were present. Analyses of the relationships between the variables suggest the tamarins and the howlers were simultaneously attracted to the same provisioned and natural food items. This led to synchrony in their use of vertical space. Early in the day, when provisioned food was more freq [...] ...|$|R
