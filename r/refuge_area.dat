2500|$|La Pintada is {{an archaeological}} zone located [...] {{south of the}} city and was a <b>refuge</b> <b>area</b> for the Seri and Pima Indians. The site is {{important}} because of its caves, which were used as dwellings, burial spaces and religious centers. The caves shelter paintings that contain numerous animals such as deer, birds and lizards as well as human figures. The human figures are stylized and some appear to be adorned with skins and/or horns, other are throwing spears and some appear to be dancing, wearing body paint. In addition there are geometric figures such as squares, triangles, circles, straight and wavy lines, all of which combine {{in one way or another}} to form complicated designs. In some areas of the caves there is evidence of paintings on top of paintings, testifying to the length of time the area was inhabited. The paintings have been attributed to the Comca'ac or Seri culture.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Natural {{biological}} control {{is one of}} the major causes responsible for reduction of pest population in agricultural ecosystem. However, natural {{biological control}} importance is usually minimized by not being estimated. This study reports the occurrence of Campoletis sonorensis (Cameron, 1886) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), Archytas marmoratus (Townsend, 1915) and Archytas incertus (Macquart, 1851) (Diptera: Tachinidae) associated with Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner, 1809) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The rate of larval parasitism was up to 41 % in structured <b>refuge</b> <b>areas</b> of cotton, without chemical control with insecticides. This study strengthens our knowledge relating to parasitoids associated with natural control of H. armigera in the American continent. In addition, it documents the rule that structured <b>refuge</b> <b>areas</b> could play as a source of natural enemies, besides their contribution to production of non-selective populations to Bt technology...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{past and}} current climatic changes, range contractions and range shifts are {{essential}} {{stages in the}} history of a species. However, unlike range expansions, the molecular consequences of these processes have been little investigated. In order to fill this gap, we simulated patterns of molecular diversity within and between populations for various types of range contractions and range shifts. We show that range contractions tend to decrease genetic diversity as compared with population with stable ranges but quite counterintuitively fast range contractions preserve higher levels of diversity and induce lower levels of genetic differentiation among <b>refuge</b> <b>areas</b> than slow contractions. Contrastingly, fast range shifts lead to lower levels of diversity than slow range shifts. At odds with our expectations, we find that species actively migrating toward <b>refuge</b> <b>areas</b> can only preserve higher levels of diversity in refugia if the contraction is rapid. Under slow range contraction or slow range shift, active migration toward refugia lead to a larger loss of diversity as compared with scenarios with isotropic migration and may thus not be a good evolutionary strategy. These results suggest that the levels of diversity preserved after a climate change both within and between <b>refuge</b> <b>areas</b> will not only depend on the dispersal abilities of a species but also on the speed of the change. It also implies that a given episode of climatic change will impact differently species with different generation times...|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{resistance}} resources {{represent an}} emerging class of environmental resources. These resources {{are the subject}} of increasing public interest, especially for resistance in agriculture and antibiotic use. This paper models genetic resistance resources as common-pool resources. The static model applies directly to the case of Bt corn, whose seeds are bioengineered to contain a pesticide. Firms produce an agricultural output, corn, using two inputs: Bt corn seeds and <b>refuge</b> <b>areas.</b> Production also depends on the common stock of environmental resistance. Seed use contributes to greater resistance, while <b>refuge</b> <b>areas</b> abate resistance. This costly form of abatement represents another (positive) externality, which allows for the optimal seed use to be greater than the competitive level. The use of seeds and <b>refuge</b> <b>areas</b> by other firms can be shown to be substitutes and compliments in production, respectively, for each firm. This simple model of externalities is complicated by introducing another important feature common to genetic resistance resources: monopoly supply in the biotechnology factor market. Monopoly provision of seeds, with imperfect price discrimination, leads the monopoly to act as a gatekeeper of the commons who tries to maximize its own rents rather than the rents from the resource. This divergence in interests leads to a deadweight loss as seed use is curtailed through higher monopoly prices. This equilibrium is compared to the competitive and the optimal cases. The way in which the resistance externality operates, through damaging others’ output or through affecting their marginal productivities, suggests whether the monopoly improves the efficiency of the seed market. Further consideration is given to the possibility that the monopoly determines the firms’ level of abatement. Assuming some enforcement mechanism, the monopoly chooses higher abatement levels to increase factor demand for seeds and increase its rents. The Under some plausible conditions, a monopoly supplier of the input that accesses the genetic resistance commons can be shown to actually improve welfare by mandating a higher level of care that also maximizes its profits. The distributional consequences of the different market structures are shown, noting how gains for the monopoly {{come at the expense of}} firms. In 2000, the EPA and Monsanto required purchasers of Bt corn to plant specific <b>refuge</b> <b>areas</b> in order to forestall resistance. This approach is readily extended to other cases, such as pesticides more generally or antibiotic use in the production of health services by households...|$|R
