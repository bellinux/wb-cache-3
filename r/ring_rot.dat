25|$|The {{causal agent}} of <b>Ring</b> <b>Rot</b> of Potato does not overwinter in the soil. The {{bacteria}} survives inside infected tubers or as dried slime on machinery or containers. For instance, if a knife cuts into an infected tuber, the next 20 tubers that the knife cuts {{have a high}} risk of becoming infected. The bacteria enters the host through wounds and invades the xylem where it multiplies via binary fission. If colonization is successful, the bacteria may plug the xylem vessels. In advanced stages of infection, the bacteria will move out of the vessels and break down the surrounding parenchyma tissue before moving into new vessels. The bacteria may also invade the roots and cause them to deteriorate.|$|E
40|$|The biggest {{difference}} between organic and conventional seed potato production {{is that the}} use of fungicides against potato late blight and seed borne diseases are forbidden in organic farming. The quarantine diseases such as bacterial <b>ring</b> <b>rots</b> and diseases limited in certified seed, like Erwinia soft rots are a serious threat to organic seed potato production. However the management strategies against these diseases are similar in both organic and conventional production. At the present only one producer in Finland is growing certified organic seed potato. Due to problems in plant protection there has not been enough courage among farmers to specialise organic seed potato production. The aim of current study is to develop crop management strategies for organic seed potato production with a special emphasise to potato late blight and Rhizoctonia diseases to provide sustainable certified seed potato production to fulfil the demand by organic potato growers. The most important research areas and tasks are: 1. The effect of cropping history and crop rotations to late blight epidemics and occurrence of Rhizoctonia black scurf 2. The importance of seed potato as primary inoculum source for potato late blight 3. The relative importance of composts, waste piles and volunteer plants as a source of primary inoculum for potato late blight 4. The possibilities to reduce disease pressure and tuber infection by increasing air flow in crop by decreasing crop density and row distance 5. Also the efficacy of defoliation to reduce tuber blight is studied. 6. Possible alternatives for synthetic chemicals to control late blight and black scurf...|$|R
40|$|The vasorelaxing {{activity}} of rotundifolone (ROT), a major constituent (63. 5 %) {{of the essential}} oil of Mentha x villosa, was tested in male Wistar rats (300 - 350 g). In isolated rat aortic <b>rings,</b> increasing <b>ROT</b> concentrations (0. 3, 1, 10, 100, 300, and 500 µg/ml) inhibited the contractile effects of 1 µM phenylephrine and of 80 or 30 mM KCl (IC 50 values, reported as means ± SEM = 184 ± 6, 185 ± 3 and 188 ± 19 µg/ml, N = 6, respectively). In aortic rings pre-contracted with 1 µM phenylephrine, the smooth muscle-relaxant {{activity of}} ROT was inhibited by removal of the vascular endothelium (IC 50 value = 235 ± 7 µg/ml, N = 6). Furthermore, ROT inhibited (pD 2 = 6. 04, N = 6) the CaCl 2 -induced contraction in depolarizing medium in a concentration-dependent manner. In Ca 2 +-free solution, ROT inhibited 1 µM phenylephrine-induced contraction in a concentration-dependent manner and did not modify the phasic contractile response evoked by caffeine (20 mM). In conclusion, {{in the present study}} we have shown that ROT produces an endothelium-independent vasorelaxing effect in the rat aorta. The results further indicated that in the rat aorta ROT is able to induce vasorelaxation, at least in part, by inhibiting both: a) voltage-dependent Ca² channels, and b) intracellular Ca 2 + release selectively due to inositol 1, 4, 5 -triphosphate activation. Additional studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying ROT-induced relaxation...|$|R

It {{was as if a}} storm swelled in the night and gradually died away in a grey morning; but there are perpetual mutterings of that storm. My point for the moment is that the exasperations come chiefly from the two extremes of the two great Semitic traditions of monotheism; and certainly not primarily from those poor Eastern Christians of whose fanaticism we have been taught to make fun. From time to time there are gleams of the extremities of Eastern fanaticism which are almost ghastly to Western feeling. They seem to crack the polish of the dignified leaders of the Arab aristocracy and the Zionist school of culture, and reveal a volcanic substance of which only oriental creeds have been made. One day a wild Jewish proclamation is passed from hand to hand, denouncing disloyal Jews who refuse the teaching Hebrew; telling doctors to let them die and hospitals to let them <b>rot,</b> <b>ringing</b> with the old unmistakable and awful accent that bade men dash their children against the stones. Another day the city would be placarded with posters printed in Damascus, telling the Jews who looked to Palestine for a national home that they should find it a national cemetery. And when these cries clash it is like the clash of those two crooked Eastern swords, that crossed and recrossed and revolved like blazing wheels, in the vanguard of the marching mob.|$|R

50|$|Red <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and {{destructive}} heart rot pathogens in the Western United States. In Engelmann spruce it is the most common type of fungal decay and causes the largest decay columns of all the fungal heart rots, rendering the tree useless for harvesting. It is a particularly important disease in lodgepole pine and subalpine fir as well. Studies have shown that 64% of all defects in these three species were caused by Phellinus pini. It has been estimated that over three-fourths of the total 17% of decayed, overmature Douglas-fir is the Pacific Northwest were in decline due to red <b>ring</b> <b>rot.</b> Apart from the economic impacts of this disease, red <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> decay may lead to mechanical failure of live trees, which may cause a potential hazard in recreational or public areas.|$|E
50|$|In most cases, {{complete}} {{elimination of}} red <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> {{is not an}} objective, and some control is achieved by cultural practices. Since red <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> is generally only a significant loss factor in very old stands, damage can be limited by managing stands to younger ages. Younger trees, if infected, are usually able to add new growth {{at a faster rate}} than that of decay. If a marketable tree is infected, it should be salvaged before disease progression significantly influences its value. Infected trees in public areas should be checked and removed if red <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> disease has rendered them potentially dangerous (trees weakened due to heart rot are more likely to fall). Where timber management is the focus, infected trees should be removed. A reduction in rotation age should be considered if decay is frequent to minimize losses. Injuries to healthy trees should be avoided during logging to prevent new infections.|$|E

In 1931 she was called upon by the Ministry of Agriculture in Lisbon to establish Portugal's Plant Quarantine Services (Servicos de Inspeccao Fitopatologica). Bensaude’s expertise in pests and pathogens of economically important crops such as pineapple, potato, garlic, wheat and onion led to many significant publications for the control, prevention, and treatment of plant diseases in Portugal. Notable pathogens studied by Bensaude include Sychytrium endobacterium (potato wart), Clavibacter sependonicum (potato <b>ring</b> <b>rot),</b> and a species of Phytophthora on citrus (Mota, 2008; Ainsworth, 1976; Jones, 1972).|$|E

5000|$|Phellinus pini (current name: Porodaedalea pini (Brot.) Murrill 1905) is a fungal plant {{pathogen}} that causes tree disease {{commonly known as}} [...] "red ring rot" [...] or [...] "white speck." [...] This disease, extremely common in the conifers of North America, decays tree trunks, rendering them useless for lumber. [...] It is a rot of the heartwood. Signs of the fungus include shelf-shaped conks protruding from the trunks of trees. Spores produced on these conks are blown by the wind {{and go on to}} infect other trees. [...] Formal management of this disease is limited, and the disease is controlled primarily by cultural practices. Red <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> is an important forest disturbance agent and {{plays a key role in}} habitat formation for several forest animals.|$|E
5000|$|As other Polypores, basidiospores are {{produced}} {{on the underside}} of the conks and are spread by wind. These wind-blown spores are the initial inoculums of the red <b>ring</b> <b>rot.</b> Once they land on a suitable small wound or twig stub, the spores may germinate and the mycelia grow into the inner wood and cause infection. P. pini produces only one type of spores, basidiospores, which is also a type of sexual spores and the fungus overwinters as mycelium in diseased trees or dead trees. When decay is sufficient to provide enough resources, a new conk may be produced. Time from infection to conk production may be 10-20 years or more. These conks are perennial and the disease cycle can be repeated with spores produced by the new conks.|$|E

5000|$|Spruce broom rust is an {{interesting}} pathogen {{in terms of its}} importance in forest management programs. Many spruce trees do not exhibit any symptoms of disease upon infection by Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli, and still many others display effects of a merely cosmetic nature. Besides obviously impacting visual quality, spruce broom rust can also have major, more economically important impacts on timber productivity. Nutrients that were originally sequestered for growth in spruce are redirected to the brooms, which can lead to a reduction in height and radial tree growth. [...] For example, a 1963 US Forest Service study found that trees infected by Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli showed a 30 percent reduction in growth over the course of ten years as compared to healthy trees. [...] The extent of this damage depends on the number and size of brooms, as well as their location. [...] When brooms occur upon the primary bole of the spruce, this can lead to a phenomenon known as top kill, in which the portion of the spruce above the brooms dies. [...] As the infection continues to grow and more sections of the tree die, new entrance ways open up for wood decaying fungi, such as red <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> (Phellinus pini). [...] These fungi are capable of devastating the volume of usable wood obtained from spruce trees, and in turn greatly reducing the trees’ marketable value, because they are highly specialized in removing the wood’s structural compounds. [...] Additionally, this internal wood decay causes spruce trees to become structurally unstable, posing relevant hazards in residential and recreational areas. [...] Finally, although tree death is not common in infected trees, Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli may weaken the spruce and cause it to become highly vulnerable to other potential killers such as other fungi, bark beetles, or simply by increasing the tree’s susceptibility to intense wind, water, and snow. [...] The same 1963 US Forest Service study found that infected trees had a three times greater mortality rate over a ten-year period than healthy trees. Nevertheless, Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli may indeed play an ecologically vital role in the Yukon. Oftentimes squirrels, fishers, and other forest animals utilize cavities within brooms, especially those carved out by other wood decaying fungi, as sources of shelter and dens.|$|E

Strain 9001 showed obvious antagonistic activity to B. dothidea YL- 1 when plated on potato dextrose agar. Soaking healthy apples in the bacterial suspensions of strain 9001 prior to artificial inoculation of fungal pathogen resulted in a dramatic decrease in disease incidence when compared to the control. Moreover, either field application in the growth season or postharvest treatment of apples from infected orchards with bacterial suspensions of strain 9001 resulted in significantly reduced disease incidence within the storage period for 4 months at room temperature. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of 16 S rRNA and the gyrA gene, strain 9001 was identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. These results indicated that B. amyloliquefaciens 9001 could be a promising agent in biocontrol of apple <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> on fruit, which might help to minimize the yield loss of apple fruit during the long postharvest period...|$|E
