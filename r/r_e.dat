40|$|The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud product {{provides}} {{three separate}} 1 km resolution retrievals of cloud particle effective radii (<b>r</b> (sub <b>e)),</b> derived from 1. 6, 2. 1 and 3. 7 micron band observations. In this study, {{differences among the}} three size retrievals for maritime water clouds (designated as <b>r</b> (sub <b>e),</b> 1. 6 <b>r</b> (sub <b>e),</b> 2. 1 and <b>r</b> (sub <b>e),</b> 3. 7) were systematically investigated {{through a series of}} case studies and global analyses. Substantial differences are found between <b>r</b> (sub <b>e),</b> 3. 7 and <b>r</b> (sub <b>e),</b> 2. 1 retrievals (delta <b>r</b> (sub <b>e),</b> 3. 7 - 2. l), with a strong dependence on cloud regime. The differences are typically small, within +/- 2 micron, over relatively spatially homogeneous coastal stratocumulus cloud regions. However, for trade wind cumulus regimes, <b>r</b> (sub <b>e),</b> 3. 7 was found to be substantially smaller than <b>r</b> (sub <b>e),</b> 2. 1, sometimes by more than 10 micron. The correlation of delta r(sub e), 3. 7 - 2. 1 with key cloud parameters, including the cloud optical thickness (tau), <b>r</b> (sub <b>e)</b> and a cloud horizontal heterogeneity index (H-sigma) derived from 250 m resolution MODIS 0. 86 micron band observations, were investigated using one month of MODIS Terra data. It was found that differences among the three <b>r</b> (sub <b>e)</b> retrievals for optically thin clouds (tau 0. 3, both <b>r</b> (sub <b>e),</b> 1. 6 and <b>r</b> (sub <b>e),</b> 2. 1 were seen to increase quickly with H-sigma. On the other hand, <b>r</b> (sub <b>e),</b> 3. 7 statistics showed little dependence on H-sigma and remained relatively stable over the whole range of H-sigma values. Potential contributing causes to the substantial <b>r</b> (sub <b>e),</b> 3. 7 and <b>r</b> (sub <b>e),</b> 2. 1 differences are discussed. In particular, based on both 1 -D and 3 -D radiative transfer simulations, we have elucidated mechanisms by which cloud heterogeneity and 3 -D radiative effects can cause large differences between <b>r</b> (sub <b>e),</b> 3. 7 and <b>r</b> (sub <b>e),</b> 2. l retrievals for highly inhomogeneous clouds. Our results suggest that the contrast in observed delta <b>r</b> (sub <b>e)</b> 3. 7 - 2. 1 between cloud regimes is correlated with increases in both cloud <b>r</b> (sub <b>e)</b> and H-sigma. We also speculate that in some highly inhomogeneous drizzling clouds, vertical structure induced by drizzle and 3 -D radiative effects might operate together to cause dramatic differences between <b>r</b> (sub <b>e),</b> 3. 7 and <b>r</b> (sub <b>e),</b> 2. 1 retrievals...|$|R

5|$|Historian <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> Smith {{notes that}} there was a need to raise {{additional}} legions in an emergency to repel specific strategic threats. He argues that this may have resulted in two types of legion. Long-standing legions deployed overseas were probably professional troops forming a standing army. Quickly-formed new legions, in contrast, consisted of younger men, perhaps with little or no military experience, who hoped for adventure and plunder. However, no distinction in basic pay, discipline or armour is known of between the two types of legion. The practice of veteran troops signing up again voluntarily into newly raised legions must have meant that no one army conformed exactly to one or other of these theoretical archetypes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Test match played, between Australia and England in March 1877, Charles Bannerman {{became the first}} player to score a century in Test cricket. In a match in which no other player scored more than 20 runs in either innings for Australia, Bannerman scored 165 not out. That score {{remained}} the highest on debut until <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> Foster scored 287 for England against Australia in 1903. Foster's innings was the highest score in Test cricket until 1930, and remains the highest score amongst Test debutants. His double-century is one of five made on Test debut, the other four were scored by Rowe, Brendon Kuruppu, Mathew Sinclair and Jacques Rudolph. Eight players (Bill Ponsford, Doug Walters, Alvin Kallicharran, Mohammad Azharuddin, Greg Blewett, Sourav Ganguly, Rohit Sharma, and James Neesham) went on to make centuries in the second test as well; Azharuddin is the only player to score centuries in his first three tests.|$|E

The scientists occupied a house at 3470 Simpson Street in downtown Montreal that belonged to McGill University. This soon became so crowded that bathrooms were used for offices, with the bath tubs used to store papers and books. They were relieved to move to the more spacious accommodation at the Université de Montréal in March. The laboratory grew to over 300 staff, about half of whom were Canadians recruited by Laurence.|$|E
5|$|There was {{resistance}} from the air, though. As the fifth wave of seven LCIs was coming in to Red Beach, they were attacked by six Zeke fighters and three Betty bombers that dropped twelve bombs. One hit the deck of USS LCI-339 forward of the conning tower; another two were near misses. Badly damaged and riddled by bullets and fragments, the ship caught fire. LCI-339 remained on the beach, where she served as a landmark for Japanese aircraft. She was eventually towed off the beach, but then drifted onto a reef and became a total loss. USS LCI-341 suffered a near miss that tore a huge hole in its side. Eight Australians were killed, including Lieutenant Colonel <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> Wall, the commanding officer of the 2/23rd Infantry Battalion, and 45 were wounded.|$|E

5|$|In 1986 Charig and Milner first {{suggested}} that its elongated snout with many finely serrated teeth indicated that Baryonyx was piscivorous (a fish-eater), speculating that it crouched on a riverbank and used its claw to gaff {{fish out of}} the water (similar to the modern grizzly bear). In 1984, Taquet pointed out that the spinosaurid snouts from Niger were {{similar to those of the}} modern gharial and suggested a behaviour similar to herons or storks. In 1997 Charig and Milner rejected their initial proposal that the articulation between the premaxilla and maxilla was mobile. In 1987 Andrew Kitchener disputed the piscivorous behaviour of Baryonyx and {{suggested that}} it would have been a scavenger, using its long neck to feed on the ground, its claws to break into a carcass, and its long snout (with nostrils far back for breathing) for investigating the body cavity. Kitchener argued that Baryonyx jaws and teeth were too weak to kill other dinosaurs and too heavy to catch fish, with too many adaptations for piscivory. According to <b>R.</b> <b>E.</b> H. Reid, a scavenged carcass would have been broken up by its predator and large animals capable of doing so—such as grizzly bears—are also capable of catching fish (at least in shallow water).|$|E

40|$|Fibroblast growth factor- 1 (FGF 1) and FGF 2 play a {{critical}} role in angiogenesis, a formation of new blood vessels from existing blood vessels. Integrins are critically involved in FGF signaling through crosstalk. We previously reported that FGF 1 directly binds to integrin avb 3 and induces FGF receptor- 1 (FGFR 1) -FGF 1 -integrin avb 3 ternary complex. We previously generated an integrin binding defective FGF 1 mutant (Arg- 50 to Glu, <b>R</b> 50 <b>E).</b> <b>R</b> 50 <b>E</b> is defective in inducing ternary complex formation, cell proliferation, and cell migration, and suppresses FGF signaling induced by WT FGF 1 (a dominant-negative effect) in vitro. These findings suggest that FGFR and avb 3 crosstalk through direct integrin binding to FGF, and that <b>R</b> 50 <b>E</b> acts as an antagonist to FGFR. We studied if <b>R</b> 50 <b>E</b> suppresses tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. Here we describe that <b>R</b> 50 <b>E</b> suppressed tumor growth in vivo while WT FGF 1 enhanced it using cancer cells that stably express WT FGF 1 or <b>R</b> 50 <b>E.</b> Since <b>R</b> 50 <b>E</b> did not affect proliferation of cancer cells in vitro, we hypothesized that <b>R</b> 50 <b>E</b> suppressed tumorigenesis indirectly through suppressing angiogenesis. We thus studied the effect of <b>R</b> 50 <b>E</b> on angiogenesis in several angiogenesis models. We found that excess <b>R</b> 50 <b>E</b> suppressed FGF 1 -induced migration and tube formation of endothelial cells, FGF 1 -induced angiogenesis in matrigel plug assays, and the outgrowth of cells in aorta ring assays. Excess <b>R</b> 50 <b>E</b> suppressed FGF 1 -induced angiogenesis in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays. Interestingly, excess <b>R</b> 50 <b>E</b> suppressed FGF 2 -induced angiogenesis in CAM assays as well, suggesting that <b>R</b> 50 <b>E</b> may uniquely suppress signaling from other members of the FG...|$|R
