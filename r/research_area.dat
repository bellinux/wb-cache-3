5|$|Henry finds a {{backpack}} and disposable camera {{belonging to a}} boy named Brian Goodwin, who Delilah explains {{was the son of}} Ned (Mac Brandt), a fellow lookout. Brian had illicitly stayed with his father, though Delilah had kept this from her superiors, and both Brian and Ned had disappeared without a trace. The teenage girls are reported missing. Henry later discovers a radio and clipboard with transcripts of his conversations with Delilah. He is knocked out and finds the clipboard and radio gone. Henry proceeds to break into a government <b>research</b> <b>area,</b> discovering surveillance equipment and typewritten reports detailing his and Delilah's lives and conversations. After taking a tracking device, he leaves the compound. As Henry hikes back, he witnesses it set afire by an unknown individual. Using the tracking device, Henry finds {{a backpack}} with the keys to the cave. Delilah reports someone in Henry's tower. Henry finds a Walkman with incriminating conversations of him and Delilah plotting to destroy the compound.|$|E
30|$|This section {{provides}} the <b>research</b> <b>areas</b> between all and highly cited papers, which were sorted {{by the number}} of records based on the total publications. Overall, there were 54 <b>research</b> <b>areas</b> for the all papers group and 11 <b>research</b> <b>areas</b> for the highly cited group. As shown in (Additional file 1), the top two <b>research</b> <b>areas</b> for both groups were Computer Science and Engineering, with the highest number of records and the respective number of publications in other <b>research</b> <b>areas</b> showing that there are slightly different <b>research</b> <b>areas</b> compared to each group. The result shows that the most relevant <b>research</b> <b>areas</b> were in Computer Science with the highest number of publications. However, there were other important <b>research</b> <b>areas</b> with a lower number of records. For instance, in the <b>research</b> <b>areas</b> for the all papers group, this was followed by “Telecommunications” (527), “Operations Research Management Science” (194), “Medical Informatics” (184) and for the highly cited group it was followed by “Mathematics” (4), “Biochemistry Molecular Biology” (3), and “Biotechnology Applied Microbiology” (3).|$|R

5|$|Much {{research}} {{has been devoted to}} applications of photons in the field of quantum optics. Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an extremely fast quantum computer, and the quantum entanglement of photons is a focus of research. Nonlinear optical processes are another active <b>research</b> <b>area,</b> with topics such as two-photon absorption, self-phase modulation, modulational instability and optical parametric oscillators. However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons per se; they may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear oscillators. The nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down conversion is often used to produce single-photon states. Finally, photons are essential in some aspects of optical communication, especially for quantum cryptography.|$|E
5|$|The primary rooms {{include the}} Lair, Hatchery, Training Room, Library, and the Treasury. These {{have the same}} purpose as the first game: they {{function}} as a resting place, feeding place, training area, <b>research</b> <b>area,</b> and gold storage area respectively. The only major {{difference is that the}} Training Room can only train creatures up to experience level four. Further experience can only be gained through real combat, such as fighting in the new Combat Pit, where creatures fight to the death. The higher a creature's experience level, the stronger and more powerful they become. The highest experience level is level ten, and creatures cannot achieve levels nine or ten via the Training Room or Combat Pit.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the viewer}} {{backlash}} Animal Planet received for allowing meerkats from the Meerkat Manor series to die, the producers of the film debated including the filmed death of a young meerkat who was bitten by a snake. They questioned whether viewers would understand that the meerkats were wild animals and that human interference would disrupt the animals' natural life cycles. In addition, to avoid disrupting the research, crews are only allowed to film within the <b>research</b> <b>area</b> under a strictly enforced agreement not {{to interfere with the}} meerkats' lives. The producers ultimately included the scene, but the meerkat's cries for help as it lay dying were edited out. Other meerkat deaths depicted were reenactments. For Viale's death scene, the crew rigged a camera mounted on a platform {{on the side of a}} truck. Robin Smith, the film and series main cinematographer, hung partially out of the truck to hold the camera steady, giving the visual impression of a truck bearing down on a meerkat. To provide bird and snake footage, professional handlers were employed, ensuring the meerkats were not deliberately put in danger.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we studied}} the <b>{{research}}</b> <b>areas</b> of Chinese natural science basic research {{from a point}} view of complex network.

The analysis of the real data shows that the degree distribution of the bf <b>research</b> <b>areas</b> network (RAN) may be better fitted by the exponential distribution. It displays small world effect in which randomly chosen pairs of <b>research</b> <b>areas</b> are typically separated by only a short path of intermediate <b>research</b> <b>areas.</b> The average distance of RAN decreases with time, while the average clustering coefficient increases with time, which indicates that the scientific study would like to be integrated together in terms of the studied areas.
