5000|$|The {{pressure}} tank {{made possible the}} development of the Chicago meat industry in the US, with its concentration in one geographic area, because it allowed the economic disposal of byproducts which would otherwise overwhelm the environment in that area. At first, small companies that sprang up near the packers did the rendering. Later the packers entered the <b>rendering</b> <b>industry.</b> Gustavus Swift, Nelson Morris, and Lucius Darling were among the early pioneers of the US <b>rendering</b> <b>industry</b> with their personal backing and/or direct participation in the <b>rendering</b> <b>industry.</b> [...] Innovations came rapidly in the 20th century. Some of these were the uses for rendered products, and others were the rendering methods. In the 1920s, a batch dry rendering process was invented; the material was cooked in horizontal steam-jacketed cylinders (similar to the fertilizer dryers of the day). Advantages claimed for the dry process were economy of energy, better protein yield, faster processing, and fewer obnoxious odors. Over the years, the wet [...] "tanking" [...] process was replaced with the dry process. By the end of World War II, most rendering installations used the dry process. In the 1960s, continuous dry processes were introduced, one using a variation of the conventional dry cooker and the other making use of a mincing and evaporation process to dry the material and yield the fat. In the 1980s, high energy costs popularized the various [...] "wet" [...] continuous processes. These processes were more energy efficient and allowed the re-use of process vapours to pre-heat or dry the materials during the process.|$|E

50|$|The <b>rendering</b> <b>industry</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{recycling}} industries, and made possible the development of a large food industry. The industry takes what would otherwise be waste materials and makes useful products such as fuels, soaps, rubber, plastics, etc. At the same time, rendering solves what would otherwise be a major disposal problem. As an example, the USA recycles more than 21 million metric tons annually of highly perishable and noxious organic matter. In 2004, the U.S. industry produced over 8 million metric tons of products, of which 1.6 million metric tons were exported.|$|E

It is primarily used in the formulation of animal feed to improve the amino acid profile of the feed. Feeding of MBM to cattle is thought to have been responsible for the spread of BSE (mad cow disease). In most parts of the world, MBM is no longer allowed in feed for ruminant animals. However, MBM is still used to feed monogastric animals. It is widely used in the United States as a low-cost meat in dog food and cat food.|$|E

50|$|The use {{of poultry}} litter as food for beef cattle is legal in the United States. Prior to 1967, {{the use of}} poultry litter as cattle feed was {{unregulated}} but that year the FDA issued a policy statement that poultry litter offered in interstate commerce as animal feed was adulterated, effectively banning the practice. In 1980, FDA reversed this policy and passed regulation of litter to the states. In December 2003, {{in response to the}} detection of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) in a cow in the state of Washington, the FDA announced plans to put in place a poultry litter ban. Because poultry litter can contain recycled cattle proteins as either spilled feed or feed that has passed through the avian gut, the FDA was concerned that feeding litter would be a pathway for spreading mad cow disease. In 2004, FDA decided to take a more comprehensive approach to BSE that would remove the most infectious proteins from all animal feeds. The FDA decided at this point that a litter ban was unnecessary in part based on comments by the North American <b>Rendering</b> <b>Industry.</b> In 2005, the FDA published a proposed rule that did not include a litter ban and in 2008 the final rule did not include the ban either.|$|E

40|$|One {{third to}} {{one half of}} each animal {{produced}} for meat, milk, eggs, and fiber is not consumed by humans. These raw materials are subjected to rendering processes resulting in many useful products. Meat and bone meal, meat meal, poultry meal, hydrolyzed feather meal, blood meal, fish meal, and animal fats are the primary products resulting from the rendering process. The most important and valuable use for these animal by-products is as feed ingredients for livestock, poultry, aquaculture, and companion animals. There are volumes of scientific references validating the nutritional qualities of these products, {{and there are no}} scientific reasons for altering the practice of feeding rendered products to animals. Government agencies regulate the processing of food and feed, and the <b>rendering</b> <b>industry</b> is scrutinized often. In addition, industry programs include good manufacturing practices, HACCP, Codes of Practice, and third-party certification. The <b>rendering</b> <b>industry</b> clearly understands its role in the safe and nutritious production of animal feed ingredients and has done it very effectively for over 100 years. The availability of rendered products for animal feeds in the future depends on regulation and the market. Regulatory agencies will determine whether certain raw materials can be used for animal feed. The National Renderers Association (NRA) supports the use of science as the basis for regulation while aesthetics, product specifications, and quality differences should be left to the market place.

40|$|The {{first book}} {{written about the}} <b>rendering</b> <b>industry</b> was {{produced}} by the National Renderers Association in 1978 and was titled The Invisible Industry. In 1996, a second book entitled The Original Recyclers was published to tell everyone in government, academia, and the public what renderers are—environmentally aware producers of safe products—the original recyclers. That book was to move us into the twenty-first century, but with the pace of change, we find ourselves already {{in need of a}} new book on the <b>rendering</b> <b>industry.</b> So much has happened in the past decade that it has become necessary to publish this book, Essential Rendering.

Two cases of indigenous bovine spongiform encephalopathy discovered in the United States and eight in Canada, as well as high pathogenic avian influenza around the world, challenge renderers today. Thus, society needs to know how renderers handle, in a biosecure manner, over 59 billion pounds of the by-products from animal food production every year in the United States and Canada. Government, which promulgates rules to answer today’s diverse challenges, academia, which influences users of rendered products, and the public, which uses the products of the industry’s operations, all need to know about rendering in today’s world.

40|$|Meat {{is a major}} {{component}} of the diet of an American. However, humans do not consume one-third to one-half of each animal raised for their needs. The leftover materials are subjected to processing in the meat <b>rendering</b> <b>industry.</b> The <b>rendering</b> <b>industry</b> turns the waste material into value added ingredients. During the rendering process, air pollutants are released. These air pollutants are odor nuisances in residential areas around rendering plants. These pollutants can be controlled by the use of multistage packed towers. The packed columns used by the <b>rendering</b> <b>industry</b> are distinctive because of the addition of animal fat in the air stream. The fat can agglomerate on the packing and clog the towers. To prevent this, operates introduce a surfactant into the liquid stream for the system. The surfactant serves two roles: suspend the fat in the packed tower so that it does not stick to the packing and clog the system and coat the packing to enhance mass transfer by allowing for the creation of an even water film over the packing. HydroSolution is located in Louisville, KY and specializes in serving the rendering industries. The company makes a treatment that is added to the air scrubber, which removes air pollutants from the airstream. The air scrubber system consists of a venturi connected to two packed towers in series. The company is interested in increasing the efficiency of the packed towers and reducing the amount of fat accumulation in the system. In addition, they would like to switch to an ecofriendly surfactant. To achieve their goals, a “green” surfactant was found that has the ability to replace the current one and the concentration needed to coat adequately the packing been determined. A contact angle analyzer was used to determine extent of water coating by the calculation of the contact angle between the water droplet and the packing. A result of this test showed the soak time for the polyethylene (PE) packing was critical for a hydrophilic layer to form whereas multiple alternating layers cab apparently form on polypropylene (PP). Better performance can be obtained using PE since the ultimate contact angle is lower than the PP packing which leads to a greater degree of wetting. A sonic dismembrator was utilized to suspend animal fat of the correct size in a surfactant solution; and a particle size analyzer calculated the diameter of the particles in the solution. A force balance on the particle diameter entering the packed tower at 500 - 600 nm determined the size. Any particles larger than 600 nm would fall out of suspension while smaller ones would remain and be transferred through the system. Once the equipment settings able to produce the proper size particles were found, the surfactant concentration needed to suspend fat was estimated. These results showed that more surfactant is needed to sufficiently coat the packing than to suspend fat. To increase the efficiency of the packed towers and reduce the probability of clogging, it is recommended that HydroSolutions switch to 70 ppm Bio-Soft GSB- 9. This concentration is able to coat packing as well as 60 ppm Triton X- 100 and suspend 3 % animal fat...|$|E

30|$|Entrepreneurship is {{the process}} of seizing an {{opportunity}} to introduce new products or services in an effort to transform inventions and innovations into monetary value (Szycher, 2014). Schumpeter viewed entrepreneurship as a force of “creative destruction.” The entrepreneur carries out “new combinations,” thereby helping <b>render</b> old <b>industries</b> obsolete. Established ways of doing business are destroyed by the creation of new and better ways to do them. Drucker (1985) took this idea further, describing the entrepreneur as someone who actually searches for change, responds to it, and exploits change as an opportunity. Players of entrepreneurship are classified as social and business oriented. Business entrepreneurs typically measure performance in profit and return, but social entrepreneurs also take into account a positive return to society. Social entrepreneurs typically furthers broad social, cultural, and environmental goals and commonly is associated with the voluntary and nonprofit sectors (Thompson, 2002). At times, profit may also be a consideration for certain companies or other social enterprises.|$|R
40|$|Among the {{industrial}} activities that may cause odour nuisance problems, rendering plants represent {{one of the}} most critical sources of smelly gaseous emissions and consequently of odour complaint. In this work, the odour emission factors (OEFs) for the <b>rendering</b> <b>industry</b> are determined based on experimental data obtained by means of dynamic olfactometry. An OEF is a representative value that relates the quantity of odour released to the atmosphere to a given associated activity. The odour emission factors were calculated to be equal to 4. 52 × 108 ouE t− 1 for process air, to 8. 02 × 107 ouE t− 1 for a mixture of process air and ambient air, and to 3. 53 × 103 ouE t− 1 for wastewater treatment tanks. Furthermore, the efficiencies of different odour abatement systems used for the treatment of different gaseous emissions from this kind of facility are evaluated and compared. The abatement efficiencies of the monitored odour reduction systems decrease passing from combustors (efficiencies over 99 %) to biofilters (efficiencies between 73 and 80 %) and scrubbers (efficiencies between 41 and 60 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Several {{samples of}} feather meal {{evaluated}} at this laboratory {{during the past}} several years [I] were found to have metabolizable energy values far in excess of the 2360 kcal/kg (1073 kcalflb) reported by the National Re-search Council [2]. Values obtained were in reasonable agreement with the higher values for feather meal determined in both Europe [3] and Canada [4]. Because of the magnitude of difference between our initial results and NRC values, a broader investigation of the metabolizable energy of U. S. feather meals was initiated. The need for accurate information on the energy content of feather meals is of import-ance to both the renderer and the nutritionist.

40|$|There is an {{on-going}} {{trend for}} developing more sustainable salmon feed in which traditionally applied marine feed ingredients are replaced with alternatives. Processed animal products (PAPs) have been re-authorized as novel high quality protein ingredients in 2013. These PAPs may harbor undesirable substances such as pharmaceuticals and metabolites {{which are not}} previously associated with salmon farming, but might cause a potential risk for feed and food safety. To control these contaminants, an analytical strategy based on a generic extraction followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) using quadrupole time-of-flight mass analyzer (QTOF MS) was applied for wide scope screening. Quality control samples, consisting of PAP commodities spiked at 0. 02, 0. 1 and 0. 2 mg/kg with 150 analytes, were injected in every sample batch to verify the overall method performance. The methodology was applied to 19 commercially available PAP samples from six different types of matrices from the EU animal <b>rendering</b> <b>industry.</b> This strategy allows assessing possible emergent risk exposition of the salmon farming industry to 1005 undesirables, including pharmaceuticals, several dyes and relevant metabolites.
