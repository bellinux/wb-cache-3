ActiveAnime's reviewers commented on complex character {{design and the}} [...] "spirit" [...] that the series has, indicating that fans of serialized mystery shows would rather enjoy it. The series is also said to better suit the more matured audience. In the United States, the dubbed series faced several negative reactions toward its changes to localize the content for North American audiences. Jeffrey Harris of IGN found it pointless to change {{the names of the}} characters, and Anime News Network's Carl Kimlinger said that the changes of certain Japanese cultural references rendered several parts of the mysteries and their investigation illogical. The voice-overs proved to be a mixed bag for Carlo Santos, who reviewed the first DVD release of Case Closed for Anime News Network; he said that while the main characters sounded like [...] "real people", the secondary ones [...] " [...] off as caricatures". Lori Lancaster of Mania.com described Case Closed as [...] "a clever series that had mysteries at every corner", noting the [...] "bizarre" [...] and [...] "interesting" [...] nature of each case. IGN's Chris Wyatt was positive to the manner the cases were set up, relating them to Agatha Christie's [...] "closed room" [...] mysteries. He described the series as [...] "Inspector Gadget meets Law & Order but in an anime style." [...] His colleague, Harris, however, expressed annoyance with <b>repetitive</b> <b>elements</b> in the show and the contrived methods the series uses to keep Conan's identity a secret from certain characters.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Brosius became {{interested}} in a small brain-specific RNA that {{was thought to be}} a waste product of a mechanism orchestrating the expression of genes by RNA polymerase III transcription of identifier sequence (ID) <b>repetitive</b> <b>elements,</b> classified as SINEs, short interspersed repeats, located in the introns of brain-specific genes by making chromatin [...] accessible to RNA polymerase II. This attractive hypothesis was not tenable. Instead, the Brosius laboratory focused on this brain cytoplasmic BC1 RNA, cloned it as cDNA by developing a method for generating cDNA libraries based on non-polyadenylated RNAs, and isolated its single gene, which evolved from a retroposed copy of a transfer RNA (tRNAAla). It was shown that BC1 RNA is the source gene for ID <b>repetitive</b> <b>elements</b> in rodents, and his laboratory established that the dendritic localization of BC1 RNA in neurons co-localizes with numerous components of the translation machinery. Based on these findings, Brosius concluded as early as the eighties that: ...|$|E
2500|$|A public genome {{sequencing}} effort of cotton was initiated in 2007 by {{a consortium of}} public researchers. They agreed on a strategy to sequence the genome of cultivated, tetraploid cotton. [...] "Tetraploid" [...] means that cultivated cotton actually has two separate genomes within its nucleus, {{referred to as the}} A and D genomes. The sequencing consortium first agreed to sequence the D-genome relative of cultivated cotton (G. raimondii, a wild Central American cotton species) because of its small size and limited number of <b>repetitive</b> <b>elements.</b> It is nearly one-third the number of bases of tetraploid cotton (AD), and each chromosome is only present once. The A genome of G. arboreum would be sequenced next. Its genome is roughly twice the size of G. raimondiis. Part of the difference in size between the two genomes is the amplification of retrotransposons (GORGE). Once both diploid genomes are assembled, then research could begin sequencing the actual genomes of cultivated cotton varieties. This strategy is out of necessity; if one were to sequence the tetraploid genome without model diploid genomes, the euchromatic DNA sequences of the AD genomes would co-assemble and the <b>repetitive</b> <b>elements</b> of AD genomes would assembly independently into A and D sequences respectively. Then there would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts.|$|E

40|$|The {{transposable element}} Tdd- 3 from D. discoideum has been {{described}} originally in 1984 (Poole and Firtel, 1984).

Five out of 24 independently isolated tRNA genes proved to be associated with Tdd- 3 elements. The surprising observation that all the elements always occurred within the 3 '-flanking sequences of the Dictyostelium tRNA genes suggested the possibility of a general position specific integration of Tdd- 3 elements upon transposition. Therefore we isolated additional Tdd- 3 elements from various genomic D. discoideum libraries in order to test this hypothesis.
