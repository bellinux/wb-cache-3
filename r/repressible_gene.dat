40|$|We {{consider}} {{the design of}} a type of <b>repressible</b> <b>gene</b> circuit that is common in bacteria. In this type of circuit, a regulator protein acts to coordinately repress the expression of effector genes when a signal molecule with which it interacts is present. The regulator protein can also independently influence the expression of its own gene, such that regulator gene expression is repressible (like effector genes), constitutive, or inducible. Thus, a signal-directed change in the activity of the regulator protein can result in one of three patterns of coupled regulator and effector gene expression: direct coupling, in which regulator and effector gene expression change in the same direction; uncoupling, in which regulator gene expression remains constant while effector gene expression changes; or inverse coupling, in which regulator and effector gene expression change in opposite directions. We have investigated the functional consequences of each form of coupling using a mathematical model to compare alternative circuits on the basis of engineering-inspired criteria for functional effectiveness. The results depend on whether the regulator protein acts as a repressor or activator of transcription at the promoters of effector genes. In the case of repressor control of effector gene expression, direct coupling is optimal among the three forms of coupling, whereas in the case of activator control, inverse coupling is optimal. Results also depend on th...|$|E
40|$|We have {{reported}} previously that multiple copies of MRG 19 suppress GAL genes in a wild-type {{but not in}} a gal 80 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this report we how that disruption of MRG 19 leads to a decrease in GAL induction when S. cerevisiae is induced with 0. 02 % but not with 2. 0 % galacto e. Disruption of MRG 19 in a gal 3 background (this train shows long-term adaptation phenotype) further delays the GAL induction, supporting the notion that its function is important only under low inducing signals. As a corollary, disruption of MRG 19 in a gal 80 strain did not decrease the constitutive expression of GAL genes. These results suggest that MRG 19 has a role in GAL regulation only when the induction signal is weak. Unlike the effect on GAL gene expression, disruption of MRG 19 leads to de-repression of CYC 1 -driven beta-galactosidase activity. MRG 19 disruptant also showed a twofold increase in the rate of oxygen uptake as compared with the wild-type train. ADH 2, CTA 1, DLD 1, and CYC 7 promoters that are active during nonfermentative growth did not show any de-repression of beta-galactosidase activity in the MRG 19 disruptant. Western blot analysis indicated that MRG 19 is a glucose <b>repressible</b> <b>gene</b> and is expressed in galactose and glycerol plus lactate. Experiments using green fluorescent protein fusion constructs indicate that Mrg 19 p is localized in the nucleus consistent with the presence of a consensus nuclear localization signal sequence. Based on the above results, we propose that Mrg 19 p is a regulator of galactose and nonfermentable carbon utilization...|$|E
40|$|The {{unicellular}} red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae {{is a model}} organism {{for studying}} the basic biology of photosynthetic organisms. The C. merolae cell is composed of an extremely simple set of organelles. The genome is completely sequenced. Gene targeting and a heat-shock inducible gene expression system has been recently established. However, a conditional gene knockdown system has not been established, which {{is required for the}} examination of function of genes that are essential to cell viability and primary mutant defects. In the current study, we first evaluated the expression of a transgene from two chromosomal neutral loci located in the intergenic region between CMD 184 C and CMD 185 C, and a region upstream of the URA 5. 3 gene. There {{was no significant difference in}} expression between them and this result suggests that both may be used as neutral loci. We then designed an inducible and <b>repressible</b> <b>gene</b> expression by using promoters of nitrate-assimilation genes. The expression of nitrate-assimilation genes such as NR (nitrate reductase), NIR (nitrite reductase) and NRT (the nitrate/nitrite transporter) are reversibly regulated by their dependence on nitrogen sources. We constructed stable strains in which a cassette containing the NR, NIR or NRT promoter and sfGFP gene was inserted in a region upstream of URA 5. 3 and examined the efficacy of the promoters. The NR, NIR, and NRT promoters were constitutively activated in the nitrate medium, whereas their activities were extremely low in presence of ammonium. The activation of each promoter was immediately inhibited within a period of 1 hour by the addition of ammonium. Thus, a conditional knockdown system in C. merolae was successfully established. The activity varies among the promoters, and each is selectable according to the expression level of a target gene estimated by RNA-sequencing. This method is applicable to defects in genes of interest in photosynthetic organism...|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{cultivation}} media, such as molasses, wort, agricultural {{waste and}} lignocellulose hydrolysates, con-tain {{a mixture of}} metabolizable carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are taken up by cells in a certain order with intermittent lag phases due {{to a set of}} mechanisms controlled by glucose, referred to hereafter as glucose control. Thus, the presence or uptake of glucose has a negative impact upon the metabolism of other sugars. Glucose repression reduces the transcription rate of <b>repressible</b> <b>genes,</b> and is the most thoroughly investi-gated mechanism of glucose control (Fig. 1). In this review the different mechanisms of glucose control in Saccharomyces cereuisiae are first discussed, focusing on the mechanism of glucose repression.

40|$|Using whole genome arrays, we {{systematically}} investigated nitrogen {{regulation in}} the plant symbiotic bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti. The use of glutamate instead of ammonium as a nitrogen source induced nitrogen catabolic genes independently of the carbon source, including two glutamine synthetase genes, various aminoacid transporters and the glnKamtB operon. These responses depended on both the ntrC and glnB nitrogen regulators. Glutamate <b>repressible</b> <b>genes</b> included glutamate synthase and a H+-translocating pyrophosphate synthase. The smc 01041 -ntrBC operon was negatively autoregulated in a glnB-dependent fashion, indicating an involvement of phosphorylated NtrC. In addition to the nitrogen response, glutamate remodelled expression of carbon metabolism by inhibiting expression of the Entner-Doudoroff and pentose phosphate pathways, and by stimulating gluconeogenetic genes independently of ntrC...|$|R
40|$|Sin 4 p is a {{component}} of a mediator complex associated with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and SIN 4 is required for proper regulation of several genes in yeast, including the HO endonuclease <b>gene,</b> glucose <b>repressible</b> <b>genes</b> and MATa cell-specific genes. Previous studies indicated that SIN 4 may influence transcription through changes {{in the organization of}} chromatin. We have examined a specific chromatin structure associated with MATa cell-specific repression in sin 4 MATalpha cells to determine if SIN 4 is required for nucleosome positioning. Although the loss of SIN 4 has no effect on nucleosome location, we find that the sensitivity of bulk chromatin from sin 4 cells to micrococcal nuclease digestion is strikingly increased relative to chromatin from isogenic wild-type cells. The nuclease hypersensitivity of chromatin from sin 4 cells is not related to gross alterations in histone gene expression or to bulk increases in histone modification. Our experiments suggest that SIN 4 directly or indirectly regulates a global aspect of chromatin accessibility, providing a molecular basis for phenotypic similarities between sin 4 mutations and mutations in histones...|$|R
40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SNF 2, SNF 5 and SNF 6 genes were {{initially}} identified as genes required for expression of SUC 2 and other glucose <b>repressible</b> <b>genes.</b> The Suc(-) defect {{in all three}} of these classes of mutants is suppressed by mutations in the SPT 6 gene. Since mutations in SPT 6 had also been identified as suppressors of Ty and solo Î´ insertion mutations at the HIS 4 and LYS 2 loci, we have examined Ty transcription in snf 2, snf 5 and snf 6 mutants and have found that Ty transcription is abolished or greatly reduced. The snf 2, snf 5 and snf 6 defect for Ty transcription, like the defect for SUC 2 transcription, is suppressed by spt 6 mutations. In contrast to other mutations that abolish or greatly reduce Ty transcription (in the SPT 3, SPT 7 and SPT 8 genes), mutations in these SNF genes do not cause suppression of insertion mutations. This result suggests that the SNF 2, SNF 5 and SNF 6 gene products act by a distinct mechanism from the SPT 3, SPT 7 and SPT 8 gene products to promote transcription of Ty elements. This result also suggests that a reduction of Ty transcription is not always sufficient for activation of adjacent gene expression...|$|R

40|$|In the {{filamentous}} fungus Neurospora crassa, several {{events in the}} process of conidiation are influenced by light. Two genes, con- 6 and con- 10, which were previously shown to be transcriptionally activated during conidiation and by exposure to light, were found to be unexpressed in mycelium maintained in constant darkness or in constant light. However, when mycelium was shifted from darkness to light, transcripts of both genes appeared and were abundant. Upon further illumination both transcripts disappeared [...] i. e., their continued production was light repressed. When dark-grown mycelium was exposed to a light pulse and reincubated in the dark, expression of con- 6 and con- 10 exhibited a 20 -hr circadian periodicity. Both genes were photoinducible throughout the stages of the circadian cycle. In the mutant strains bd and bd;frq 9, con- 6 and con- 10 were light inducible but were not normally light <b>repressible.</b> Mutant <b>genes</b> such as acon- 2, acon- 3, and fl that block developmental expression of con- 6 and/or con- 10 did not prevent their photoinduction...|$|R

Expression of a recombinant fungal xylanase gene (xylp) and the cDNA for the human tear lipocalin (LCNI) was achieved by placing the encoding sequences {{under the control of}} the <b>repressible</b> acid phosphatase <b>gene</b> (phoA) promoter of P. chrysogenum. Secreted recombinant proteins were detected in the growth media of transformed P. chrysogenum cells by means of bioassays, zymogramography, and Western blotting.

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of a <b>repressible</b> chloroplast <b>gene</b> expression system in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has {{opened the door for}} studying the role of essential chloroplast genes. This approach has been used to analyze three chloroplast genes of this sort coding for the Î± subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoA), a ribosomal protein (rps 12) and the catalytic subunit of the ATP-dependent ClpP protease (clpP 1). Depletion of the three corresponding proteins leads to growth arrest and cell death. Shutdown of chloroplast transcription and translation increases the abundance of a set of plastid transcripts that includes mainly those involved in transcription, translation and proteolysis and reveals multiple regulatory feedback loops in the chloroplast gene circuitry. Depletion of ClpP profoundly affects plastid protein homeostasis and elicits an autophagy-like response with extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization of cells. It also triggers changes in chloroplast and nuclear gene expression resulting in increased abundance of chaperones, proteases, ubiquitin-related proteins and proteins involved in lipid trafficking and thylakoid biogenesis. These features are hallmarks of an unfolded protein response in the chloroplast and raise new questions on plastid protein homeostasis and plastid signaling.

40|$|OX 513 A is a {{transgenic}} {{strain of}} Aedes aegypti engineered {{to carry a}} dominant, non-sex-specific, late-acting lethal genetic system that is repressed {{in the presence of}} tetracycline. It was designed for use in a sterile-insect (SIT) pest control system called RIDLÂ® (Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal gene) by which transgenic males are released in the field to mate with wild females; in the absence of tetracycline, the progeny from such matings will not survive. We investigated the mating fitness of OX 513 A in the laboratory. Male OX 513 A were as effective as Rockefeller (ROCK) males at inducing refractoriness to further mating in wild type females and there was no reduction in their ability to inseminate multiple females. They had a lower mating success but yielded more progeny than the wild-type comparator strain (ROCK) when one male of each strain was caged with a ROCK female. Mating success and fertility of groups of 10 males-with different ratios of RIDL to ROCK-competing for five ROCK females was similar, but the median longevity of RIDL males was somewhat (18 %) lower. We conclude that the fitness under laboratory conditions of OX 513 A males carrying a tetracycline <b>repressible</b> lethal <b>gene</b> is comparable to that of males of the wild-type comparator strain...|$|R
40|$|Plastid protein {{homeostasis}} {{is critical}} during chloroplast biogenesis {{and responses to}} changes in environmental conditions. Proteases and molecular chaperones involved in plastid protein quality control are encoded by the nucleus except for the catalytic subunit of ClpP, an evolutionarily conserved serine protease. Unlike its Escherichia coli ortholog, this chloroplast protease is essential for cell viability. To study its function, we used a recently developed system of <b>repressible</b> chloroplast <b>gene</b> expression in the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Using this repressible system, we have shown that a selective gradual depletion of ClpP leads to alteration of chloroplast morphology, causes formation of vesicles, and induces extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization that is reminiscent of autophagy. Analysis of the transcriptome and proteome during ClpP depletion revealed a set of proteins that are more abundant at the protein level, {{but not at the}} RNA level. These proteins may comprise some of the ClpP substrates. Moreover, the specific increase in accumulation, both at the RNA and protein level, of small heat shock proteins, chaperones, proteases, and proteins involved in thylakoid maintenance upon perturbation of plastid protein homeostasis suggests the existence of a chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling pathway involved in organelle quality control. We suggest that this represents a chloroplast unfolded protein response that is conceptually similar to that observed in the endoplasmic reticulum and in mitochondria.

40|$|Lichen-forming fungi {{employ a}} {{successful}} mode of nutrition as symbiotic partners with green algae and/or cyanobacteria (the photobiont). Nearly one fifth of all known fungi are obligate lichen formers, yet we know little {{of how they}} find compatible partners and establish long-lived symbiotic relationships. The combined growth of these symbionts forms a body (thallus) with emergent properties unlike either of the symbionts individually grown. Based on other well-studied eukaryotic systems, {{the development of a}} lichen thallus must rely upon the successful identification and collaboration of these two very different organisms. Identifying the molecular basis of microbe recognition and interactions remains one of the greatest challenges in studying symbiotic systems. In this thesis, I determine the stage in which to begin looking for lichen symbiosis specific genes, and then examine mycobiont and photobiont genes that, when compared to the aposymbiotic state, are upregulated in the symbiotic state. Using the symbiosis between the mycobiont Cladonia grayi and the photobiont Asterochloris sp., as well as scanning electron microscopy observations of the earliest stages of contact between C. grayi and Asterochloris sp., I determined that the mycobiont undergoes a specific change in phenotypic growth in response to Asterochloris sp. This change is particular to the lichen symbiosis, and is not observed with algal shaped inanimate objects or algae other than Asterochloris. I then used this phenotypically defined stage that is exclusive to lichen symbiosis to begin studying the the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the development of a stratified lichen thallus. Using suppression subtractive hybridization to determine differential gene expression, fungal and algal libraries were made of upregulated genes in the first 2 stages of lichen symbiosis. The symbiotic expression levels of select genes were then verified using quantitative PCR. Lastly, a candidate gene for involvement in lichen symbiosis was transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae to test for protein function. Further results of this study show that the fungal protein products of genes upregulated in lichen symbiosis show significant matches to proteins putatively involved in fungal self and non-self recognition, lipid metabolism, negative regulation of glucose <b>repressible</b> <b>genes,</b> an oxidoreductase, a dioxygenase, and a conserved hypothetical protein. Algal genes that are upregulated in lichen symbiosis include a chitinase-like protein, an amino acid metabolism protein, a dynein related protein, and a protein arginine methyltransferase. Furthermore, genes that are expressed {{in the early stages of}} lichen symbiosis are common varying metabolic pathways. Furthermore stages 1 and 2 of development are marked not by a drastic change in transcriptional products, but instead by an overall change in genes that are already expressed. Finally, the Cladonia grayi Lip 3 was cloned in its entirety from genomic DNA and cDNA, was predicted to be secreted using signal peptide prediction software, and shown to be a functioning secreted extracellular lipase in yeast. I conclude that many genes are involved in the interactions of symbionts and the development of a stratified lichen thallus, and that many more genes remain to be discovered. Furthermore, the possibility that genes exist in either symbiont that are specific to lichen symbiosis remains, and that their discovery awaits the creation of better genomic tools for Cladonia grayi and Asterochloris.

This pathogenic bacterium can obtain the essential nutrient iron using its native alcaligin siderophore and by utilizing xeno-siderophores such as desferrioxamine B, ferrichrome, and enterobactin. Previous genome-wide expression profiling identified an iron <b>repressible</b> B. pertussis <b>gene</b> encoding a periplasmic protein (FbpABp). A previously reported crystal structure shows significant similarity between FbpABp and previously characterized bacterial iron binding proteins, and established its iron-binding ability.

In eukaryotes this regulation occurs {{in the context of}} chromatin which creates an inherent barrier for the binding of trans-acting factors, such as transcription factors and RNA polymerase. This dissertation focuses on the role of transcriptional activators and chromatin remodeling coactivators in the regulation of the <b>repressible</b> acid phosphatase <b>gene</b> PHO 5. Our studies show that histone methylation at lysine 4 of histone H 3 is required for the full repression of PHO 5 and GAL 1 - 10. We show that bromodomains, a domain conserved in chromatin remodeling coactivators, may function to stabilize binding.

Yeast transformants containing these plasmids expressed phaseolin at levels up to 3 % of the total soluble cellular protein. Phaseolin polypeptides in S. cerevisiae were glycosylated, and their molecular weights suggested that the signal peptide had been processed. We also constructed a series of plasmids in which the phaseolin signal-peptide-coding region was either removed or replaced with increasing amounts of the amino-terminal coding region for acid phosphatase. Phaseolin polypeptides with no signal peptide were not posttranslationally modified in S. cerevisiae. Partial or complete substitution of the phaseolin signal peptide with that from acid phosphatase dramatically inhibited both signal peptide processing and glycosylation, suggesting that some specific feature of the phaseolin signal amino acid sequence was required for these modifications to occur. Larger hybrid proteins that included approximately one-half of the acid phosphatase sequence linked to the amino terminus of the mature phaseolin polypeptide did undergo proteolytic processing and glycosylation. However, these polypeptides were cleaved at several sites that are not normally used in the unaltered acid phosphatase protein...|$|R
40|$|Transcription of the <b>repressible</b> acid {{phosphatase}} <b>gene</b> (KIPH 05) in Kluyveromyces lactis is strongly regulated {{in response to}} the level of inorganic phosphate (P(i)) present in the growth medium. We have begun a study of the promoter region of this gene in order to identify sequences involved in the phosphate control of KIPH 05 expression and to design new expression-secretion systems in K. lactis. Deletion analysis and directed mutagenesis revealed two major identical upstream activating sequences (UAS) CACGTG at positions - 430 (UAS 1) and - 192 (UAS 2) relative to the ATG initiation codon. These sequences are identical to those described for Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the binding of Pho 4 p. Deletion or directed mutagenesis of either one or both UAS reduce KIPH 05 expression by the same amount (approximately 80 %). When fused to the coding region of trout growth hormone cDNA (tGH-II), the promoter and signal peptide-encoding region of the phosphate-repressible KIPH 05 gene drives the expression of this gene and the secretion of the tGHH protein. Synthesis of tGHIIp in K. lactis transformants carrying this construct was found to be regulated by the P(i) present in the medium; derepression of heterologous protein expression can therefore be achieved by lowering the P(i) concentration.

One of these mutants (ino 1 - 5) fails to make any material that is crossreactive with antibody to the wild-type inositol- 1 -phosphate synthase. The cloned DNA restored not only inositol prototrophy to this mutant but also its ability to make material crossreactive with anti-inositol- 1 -phosphate synthase antibody. The sequence on an integrative plasmid was also shown to recombine with the INO 1 locus, thereby confirming its genetic identity.
