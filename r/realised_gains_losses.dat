We find that the main determinants are underpricing (consistent with the disposition effect, i. e., a tendency to <b>realise</b> <b>gains</b> before <b>losses),</b> whether the IPO market is “hot ” (a proxy for the representativeness heuristic) and ex ante risk characteristics. We also relate flipping activity to the firm’s long-run return, and find that the flipping behaviour of large (informed) investors is unrelated to long-run returns, while uninformed investors consistently flip more of the IPOs that have better long-run returns...|$|R

This tendency was denominated the disposition effect by Shefrin and Statman (1985). This research provides evidence of the disposition effect on the Portuguese stock market, by studying a unique database that consists on trading records of 1496 individual investors. The preference for <b>realising</b> <b>gains</b> to <b>losses</b> was observed every {{month of the year}} and for all individual investors. Even {{at the end of the}} fiscal year, the disposition effect still holds (in spite of the existence of fiscal incentives for the so-called fiscal effect), as opposed to the evidence found in other markets. We also found that more sophisticated investors (classified on the basis of frequency of transaction, volume and portfolio value), are less prone to the disposition effect than less sophisticated ones. We also identified differences as to the disposition effect in terms of its intensity, when considering different market trends. In bull market periods, the disposition effect is even more evident than in bear markets and significant in both markets...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the main}} drivers of the ECB 2 ̆ 019 s balance sheet and {{profit and loss}} account over the first 11 years of the ECB 2 ̆ 019 s existence. Furthermore, the paper assesses the financial strength of the ECB. As monetary policy operations are normally conducted by national central banks under the impulse and instructions from the ECB, the Eurosystem balance sheet is the primary reference for the analysis of Eurosystem monetary policy operations. Three main drivers of the balance sheet and {{profit and loss account}} are identified. Firstly, financial market developments and portfolio management decisions imply changes {{in the value of the}} foreign reserve and own funds portfolios, which represent a substantial part of the balance sheet (with the share of own funds becoming increasingly larger over the period under review). At the same time, the profit and loss account depends to an important degree on interest income and expenses, <b>realised</b> <b>gains</b> and <b>losses,</b> and write-downs on these portfolios. Secondly, strong banknote demand has gradually increased the size of the balance sheet since the euro changeover in 2002. Banknotes in circulation also provide a strong base for seigniorage income, which is an important item of the profit and loss account. Thirdly, the liquidity-providing operations in foreign currency, which the Eurosystem has undertaken since 2007 in response to the fi nancial crisis, increased significantly the size of the ECB 2 ̆ 019 s (and the Eurosystem 2 ̆ 019 s) balance sheet. In terms of income and expenses, these operations were rather immaterial at the level of the ECB, although the income generated was substantial at the Eurosystem level. The ECB has remained financially strong over the 11 -year period. Factors that support the financial position are strong legislative provisions on e. g. independence and income, the use of financial buffers, seigniorage as a reliable income source and an effective loss-coverage mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The “disposition effect” {{describes}} the propensity for investors to <b>realise</b> <b>gains</b> sooner than <b>losses</b> through selling profit making investments {{more readily than}} loss making investments. This behaviour has been observed in financial markets across the world and across all investor classes, albeit to varying degrees. Such trading behaviour has been found not to be profit or utility maximising. I n the absence of rational motives for the disposition effect, it is concluded as being an irrational feature of investor trading behaviour. In search of the reason behind this behaviour, behavioural finance is turned to. No concrete justification for the disposition effect has been isolated as being the sole cause for this apparently irrational trading behaviour. This study tests for the disposition effect in a South African context across two classes of non-professional investors: those acting in their own capacity, and those acting {{with the assistance of}} professional investment advisors. The trade history of a sample of 4 840 investor accounts from a South African stockbroker was analysed over the five year period from October 2008 to October 2013. Three primary issues were addressed: (i) whether South African investors exhibit the disposition effect, (ii) if this behaviour is reduced by non-professional investors through the employment of professional advice, and (iii) if this trading behaviour can be justified based on rational g rounds in a South African context. The results showed, consistent with studies elsewhere in the world, that individual investors in South Africa do exhibit the disposition effect both when acting in their own capacity and when acting with the assistance of professionals. Investors acting with the assistance of professional advisors are found, however, to show the effect to a lesser extent. Further, trading consistent with the disposition effect by investors acting with the assistance of professional advisors is found to be rationally justifiable on the grounds of portfolio rebalancing. It is therefore concluded that professional advice reduces the extent to which this irrational trading behaviour is exhibited, thereby increasing investor profits and utility...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an in depth analysis of investors’ reluctance to crystallise losses and propensity to <b>realise</b> <b>gains,</b> a behavioural bias dubbed the disposition effect. We examine a comprehensive data set comprised of trading records for individual and institutional investors within the Finnish Stock Market over an extensive ten year period. Consistent with previous studies, {{we find that}} the disposition effect exists for not only individuals, but also for institutions. We conclude that despite significantly attenuating, ‘professionalism’ (i. e. investor sophistication) is unable to provide total immunity from the disposition bias. Moreover, this study confirms the existence of an apparent asymmetric relationship between trading experience and the disposition effect. Both individuals and institutions exhibit learning effects over time, with the accumulation of trading experience inversely related to the bias. However, while investors are capable of completely eliminating their tendency to ride losses, we found that no amount of trading experience is capable of eradicating an investor’s propensity to <b>realise</b> <b>gains...</b>|$|R

40|$|It is {{important}} to have an understanding of the population genetics and validity of the pertinent underlying assumptions of a species in order to design an effective breeding strategy. In a South African breeding population of Eucalyptus nitens, various scenarios investigating a range of assumptions were developed and used to predict genetic gain in the F 2. These were compared with <b>realised</b> <b>gains</b> achieved in a series of genetic gain trials. In the two scenarios using firstly, actual flowering for family (provenance) and, secondly, estimated flowering after 30 % roguing of poor families, a coefficient of relationship of 0. 33 resulted in predictions closest to <b>realised</b> <b>gain,</b> on average. The statistical information suggested that outcrossing in the seed orchards was[80 %. Indications were that the effects were additive, and that very little or no heterosis had occurred, due to the still significant provenance effects and the lack of provenance rank changes in the F 2. The custom of assuming a degree of inbreeding (and using a coefficient of relationship of 0. 33) and of including provenance effects in the models, on average resulted in genetic gain predictions which were very similar to the <b>realised</b> genetic <b>gains</b> in this population of E. nitens.

40|$|The modules of the LHCb Outer Tracker {{have shown}} {{to suffer from}} <b>gain</b> <b>loss</b> under {{irradiation}} at moderate intensities, {{a process known as}} ageing. The plastifier in the glue with which the detector modules were constructed, Araldite AY 103 - 1, {{has been shown to be}} the culprit. In this thesis this is confirmed by irradiating a module constructed with Araldite AY 105 - 1, which does not contain the harmful plastifier. Several methods to prevent and repair the <b>gain</b> <b>loss</b> exist. One preventive measure is the addition of oxygen. However, because of its electronegative nature, oxygen can capture some of the drifting electrons, thereby lowering the gain of the OT. Simulations have been done to investigate the effect of oxygen on the gain and efficiency. One method to remove the ageing is HV training. In this procedure the applied voltage is increased such, that the OT enters the discharge regime. These discharges mostly remove the ageing, but can take place anywhere in the straw tube, not necessarily at the location of the ageing. Curing the module while putting a source near the location of the ageing is shown to always cure the <b>gain</b> <b>loss.</b> Finally, a method has been devised to quantify the amount of <b>gain</b> <b>loss</b> in the OT with the standard OT readout electronics. By performing a threshold scan it is possible to accurately determine the average <b>gain</b> <b>loss</b> of the straws...|$|R
