5000|$|In {{the course}} of {{preparation}} of the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan) of 2003, the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing examined plans for duplicating the Brunswick-Hamelin-Löhne axis as a southern freight bypass of the Hanover rail node. As {{a result of this}} project was included as No. 7 in the list of first priority needs in the 2003 plan. [...] In the assessment of the needs in the federal railway plans that were published on 11 November 2010, the southern bypass of the node of Hanover via the Weser Railway was found to have a benefit-cost ratio of 2.5. Duplication and electrification of the line are proposed as a second phase of the construction of this project. There have been objections to these plans, for example in Bad Oeynhausen, where noise pollution is feared in the town. Due to the expected significant increase in <b>railway</b> <b>noise,</b> further resistance has developed in affected cities and communities.|$|E

40|$|Directivity is an {{important}} parameter to describe a sound source. For <b>railway</b> rolling <b>noise</b> this becomes a complicated issue because its vertical and horizontal directivities depend on many factors. In this paper a complete procedure to determine the vertical and horizontal directivities of <b>railway</b> rolling <b>noise</b> in one-third octave bands has been proposed. The procedure consists of two parts: (1) to define the vertical and horizontal directivities both for track and wheel radiations; (2) to determine the effective vertical and horizontal directivities for the total <b>railway</b> rolling <b>noise.</b> For practical reasons {{it is better to}} include the shielding effect of the car-body, also the low barriers when they are present alongside a track. Since this shielding effect dominates, the inclusive vertical directivity of <b>railway</b> rolling <b>noise</b> can vary with train types, and will also be different when influenced by low barriers (such as viaducts). The horizontal directivity of <b>railway</b> rolling <b>noise</b> is determined by the horizontal directivities of the track and wheel radiations, and weighted by the relative importance of the two sub-sources which is described by the track and vehicle transfer functions. In general, the horizontal directivity of <b>railway</b> rolling <b>noise</b> varies with different vehicle-track combinations...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Surveys {{suggest that}} - {{at the same}} noise level - <b>railway</b> <b>noise</b> is less {{annoying}} than aircraft or road traffic noise. Thus, <b>railway</b> <b>noise</b> is less strongly regulated in some European countries. However, in a laboratory study performed at the DLR-Institute of Aerospace Medicine <b>railway</b> <b>noise</b> lead to higher degrees of sleep fragmentation than aircraft noise.

Methods: In a field study on <b>railway</b> <b>noise,</b> 33 healthy participants (mean age 36. 2 years ± 10. 3 (SD); 22 females) were examined during nine consecutive nights. Polysomnography and noise events were recorded during every night. In total, 8866 <b>railway</b> <b>noise</b> events were used for analysis of noise-induced awakenings. In a field study on aircraft noise, data from 64 subjects and 10658 noise events were recorded. The datasets from rail and aircraft noise were pooled to facilitate a direct comparison.

40|$|Noise {{in housing}} environments may {{increase}} the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); however, the most significant sources of noise among elderly individuals remain poorly understood. A nationwide cross-sectional study comprised of 6, 181 elderly people (age ≥ 65 years) was conducted using a web-based self-reported questionnaire in 2014. Questions pertaining to CVD-related subjective symptoms within the past year addressed symptoms of chest pain, disturbances in pulse, acute impaired tongue movement, limb paralysis, and foot pain or numbness during walking. Questions concerning noise included awakening during the night due to noise, automobile, neighborhood, construction, <b>railway,</b> and aircraft <b>noise.</b> The multivariable analyses revealed that all symptoms were significantly associated with awakening during the night due to <b>noise.</b> Automobile, construction, <b>railway,</b> and aircraft <b>noise</b> were significantly associated with more CVD-related symptoms at nighttime than at daytime. Our results suggest that noise at nighttime is an important risk factor for CVDs. Although several different sources of environmental noise, including automobile, neighborhood, construction, <b>railway,</b> and aircraft <b>noise</b> were found to be significantly associated with CVD-related symptoms, the strongest association was observed for construction noise, followed by neighborhood and automobile noise. The adjusted odds ratios (95 % confidence intervals) for construction noise at nighttime were 1. 12 (1. 06 - 1. 19) with disturbances in pulse, 1. 21 (1. 08 - 1. 35) in acute impaired tongue movement, 1. 25 (1. 15 - 1. 36) in limb paralysis, and 1. 19 (1. 12 - 1. 28) in foot pain or numbness during walking.

The main {{objective of this}} paper was to establish exposure-response relationships between nocturnal <b>railway</b> <b>noise</b> exposure and annoyance and to examine self-reported sleep disturbances as short-term reactions to noise. In a field study 33 residents living close to railway tracks in the Cologne/Bonn area (Germany) were investigated. <b>Railway</b> <b>noise</b> was measured indoors during nine consecutive nights at each site. Questionnaires referring to annoyance and non-acoustical factors were performed. Annoyance ratings increased significantly with the total number of trains and freight trains per night, and non-significantly with rising number of passenger trains and energy equivalent sound pressure level (LAeq), when adjusting the model for non-acoustical variables.

40|$|In {{some regions}} the {{exposure}} to <b>railway</b> <b>noise</b> is extremely concentrated, which may lead to high residential annoyance. Nonacoustical factors contribute to these reactions, but there is limited evidence on the interrelations between the nonacoustical factors that influence <b>railway</b> <b>noise</b> annoyance. The aims {{of the present study}} were (1) to examine exposure-response relationships between long-term <b>railway</b> <b>noise</b> exposure and annoyance in a region severely affected by <b>railway</b> <b>noise</b> and (2) to determine a priori proposed interrelations between nonacoustical factors by structural equation analysis. Residents (n = 320) living close to railway tracks in the Middle Rhine Valley completed a socioacoustic survey. Individual noise exposure levels were calculated by an acoustical simulation model for this area. The derived exposure-response relationships indicated considerably higher annoyance at the same noise exposure level than would have been predicted by the European Union standard curve, particularly for the night-time period. In the structural equation analysis, 72 % of the variance in noise annoyance was explained by the noise exposure (Lden) and nonacoustical variables. The model provides insights into several causal mechanisms underlying the formation of <b>railway</b> <b>noise</b> annoyance considering indirect and reciprocal effects. The concern about harmful effects of <b>railway</b> <b>noise</b> and railway traffic, the perceived control and coping capacity, and the individual noise sensitivity were the most important factors that influence noise annoyance.

40|$|For a sound source, {{directivity}} is {{an important}} parameter to specify. This parameter also reflects the physical feature of the sound generation mechanism. For example, turbulence sound is of quadrupole directivity whilst fluid-structure interaction often induces a sound of dipole characteristic. Therefore, to reach a proper directivity description {{is in fact a}} process of understanding the sound source in a better way. However, in practice, this is often not a simple procedure. As for <b>railway</b> <b>noise</b> engineering, several noise types of different directivity characteristics are often mixed together, such as wheel and rail radiation, engine and cooling fan noise, scattered fluid sound around the bogie areas and turbulent boundary layer noise along the train side surfaces. Moreover, it is a question if the horizontal directivity of a line source can be measured directly. All these factors increase difficulties in reaching a proper directivity description that may explain why modelling directivities of <b>railway</b> <b>noise</b> sources is so far behind modelling their sound powers. This thesis work aims at working out an applicable directivity description of <b>railway</b> <b>noise</b> sources. The study focuses on the two most important <b>railway</b> <b>noise</b> types, i. e. rolling noise and aerodynamic noise. Directivities of these two noise types are studied based on measurement investigation, theoretical problem solution and model analysis. As for wheel/rail radiation, a model of a perpendicular dipole pair (PDP) was proposed to interpret those measurement specified directivity characteristics. This model naturally explains why rail radiation is of different horizontal and vertical directivities and why a vibrating railway wheel does not present dipole directivity. As for aerodynamic noise, it has been found that pantograph noise is also of perpendicular dipole components. Moreover, for aerodynamic noise around bogie areas, scattering of the air flow was proposed to be the dominant mechanism of the noise generation. This understanding leads to a different directivity description for this noise component. And, once again, scattered fluid sound around the bogie areas and turbulent boundary layer noise along the train side surfaces can be treated as a PDP source. Finally, to complete directivity description of <b>railway</b> <b>noise,</b> directivities of other important noise types have been studied as well; the directivity characteristics of these noise types become understood although lack the relevant directivity data. With all these outputs integrated, a survey of the directivities of all important <b>railway</b> <b>noise</b> sources has been achieved and applicable directivity functions have been worked out.
