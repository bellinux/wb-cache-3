Currently, risky levels {{of private and}} public debts coexist with vast amounts of savings that "do not know where to go. " Long-term climate-oriented financial products could enhance investors' confidence in low-carbon projects (LCP) and channel to them large amounts of private savings. The paper outlines a financial architecture, the cornerstone of which is an agreement on the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) integrated into a project's appraisal and acting as a surrogate for a carbon price. This SCC would be the value of carbon certificates issued {{by the government and}} delivered to banks to issue credit facilities reducing the risk-adjusted costs of LCPs. These carbon certificates could be gradually transformed into legal <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> of the banks after verification of the reality of the projects. Finally, the paper considers whether such certificates would be recognized as genuine international <b>reserve</b> <b>assets,</b> backed by the rising value of carbon over time. It shows how emerging countries could then diversify their foreign exchange <b>reserves</b> through an <b>asset</b> based on the international recognition of climate as a global public good...|$|R
