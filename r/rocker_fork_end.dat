5000|$|Some {{rear track}} <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> have {{threaded}} devices ("chaintugs") {{to aid in}} setting the proper chain tension. These may be integral to the <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> or separate items. They work by holding the rear axle in an eye {{at the end of}} a threaded bolt. The bolt passes through a cap which fits over the open <b>fork</b> <b>end.</b> Tightening the bolts on each side causes the axle to be pulled backwards towards the open <b>fork</b> <b>end,</b> tensing the chain. Chaintugs can also solve the problem of [...] "axle creep" [...] on hard-ridden fixed-gear bicycles, especially those with hard chromed <b>fork</b> <b>ends,</b> which may not offer adequate grip for the serrated track nuts.|$|R
25|$|The rear {{triangle}} {{connects to}} the rear <b>fork</b> <b>ends,</b> where the rear wheel is attached. It consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run connecting the bottom bracket to the rear <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b> The seat stays connect {{the top of the}} seat tube (often at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>fork</b> <b>end,</b> [...] fork-end, or forkend is a slot in {{a bicycle}} frame or bicycle fork where the axle of a bicycle wheel is attached. A dropout {{is a type}} of <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> that allows the rear wheel to be removed without first derailing the chain.|$|R

50|$|Track bicycle frames have track <b>fork</b> <b>ends,</b> {{on which}} the opening faces rearwards. Because {{they do not have}} dropouts, the chain must be derailed from the {{sprocket}} before the rear wheel can be removed from a typical track bike. Some single-speed bicycles intended for street or trail use are also equipped with track <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> instead of dropouts.|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} failure in a Turn buckle is investigated. It {{was found that}} the {{fracture}} had occured at the rivet hole close to the <b>fork</b> <b>end.</b> Electron microscope study of the fracture surface showed that the <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> of the turn buckle had failed by a fatigue initiated fracture and that the fatigue could have originated due to excessive clearance in this region...|$|R
60|$|The real {{object of}} these {{preliminary}} feats, however performed, is, probably, to inspire faith, which Dr. Charcot {{might have done}} by swallowing a cradle. The Indians explain that the barrel staves apparently swallowed are merely dematerialised by 'spirits,' leaving only the <b>forked</b> <b>end</b> {{sticking out of the}} conjurer's mouth. In fact, Hearne caught the conjurer in the act of making a separate <b>forked</b> <b>end.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... {{the maximum}} {{internal}} {{distance between the}} front <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> is 10.5 cm, and of the rear stays 13.5 cm ...|$|R
50|$|The final regular {{passenger}} {{service to}} Ash <b>Fork</b> <b>ended</b> in April 1969, when train number 42, nicknamed the Hassayampa Flyer, was discontinued.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fork</b> <b>ends</b> and {{dropouts}} may {{support one}} or more eyelets, small protruding tabs with holes, often threaded, to facilitate the mounting of racks and fenders.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A single-speed {{mountain}} bike. The {{frame was}} modified by replacing the rear drop-outs with track <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> {{to allow the}} chain to be tensioned.|$|R
50|$|The TZR125R SP {{is based}} on the 4DL Series 1 but is {{recognised}} by the black Deltabox frame, swing-arm, rims, <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> and a long expansion chamber stinger.|$|R
50|$|Bicycle forks {{usually have}} an offset, or rake (not to be {{confused}} with a different use of the word rake in the motorcycle world), that places the <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> forward of the steering axis. This is achieved by curving the blades forward, angling straight blades forward, or by placing the <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> forward of the centerline of the blades. The latter is used in suspension forks that must have straight blades in order for the suspension mechanism to work. Curved fork blades can also provide some shock absorption.|$|R
50|$|The {{source is}} near Penkun, {{from which the}} river flows both to the North and to the South. The {{southern}} <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> with its confluence to the Welse river, the northern <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> with the confluence with the Uecker only a few kilometers before reaching the Oder Lagoon. The swampy Randow valley is known as Randowbruch, the historical crossing of the Randowbruch swamps are at its narrowest point in LÃ¶cknitz. The river lent {{its name to the}} former district of Uecker-Randow in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, also to the historical Landkreis Randow of the Province of Pomerania.|$|R
50|$|In general, {{a modern}} bicycle frame {{intended}} for derailleur gears {{will have a}} vertical dropout, while one designed for singlespeed or hub gears will have horizontal dropouts or track <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R
50|$|Forks {{have been}} made from steel, {{aluminum}}, carbon fiber, titanium, magnesium, and various combinations. For example, a fork may have carbon fiber blades with an aluminum crown, steer tube, or <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{wheel axle}} fits into <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> {{in the frame}} and fork. A pair of wheels may be called a wheelset, {{especially}} {{in the context of}} ready-built [...] "off the shelf", performance-oriented wheels.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{terminus}} of the Viedma Glacier {{where it}} enters Lake Viedma. Glacial calving is visible {{at the bottom}} where the glacier forks to the left. The right <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> in a cliff. (NASA) ...|$|R
50|$|SR 80 and the Russell Fork {{continue}} past Davenport and Council. The <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> as {{the road}} approaches Sandy Ridge and the Tennessee Valley Divide, which it climbs Big A Mountain via a series of hairpin curves.|$|R
50|$|Forks {{may have}} {{attachment}} points for brakes, racks, and fenders. These may {{be located in}} the crown, along the blades, and near the <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b> These are often holes, threaded or not, and may be located on tabs that protrude.|$|R
5000|$|The was (Egyptian w3s [...] "power, dominion") sceptre is {{a symbol}} that {{appeared}} often in relics, art, and hieroglyphics associated with the ancient Egyptian religion. It appears as a stylized animal head {{at the top of}} a long, straight staff with a <b>forked</b> <b>end.</b>|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the dangers}} {{inherent}} in slingshots is the high probability that the bands will fail. Most bands are made from latex, which degrades with time and use, causing the bands to eventually fail under load. [...] Failures at the pouch end are safest, as they result in the band rebounding away from the user. Failures at the <b>fork</b> <b>end,</b> however, send the band back towards the shooter's face, which can cause eye and facial injuries. [...] One method to minimize {{the chance of a}} <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> failure is to utilize a tapered band, thinner at the pouch end, and thicker and stronger at the <b>fork</b> <b>end.</b> [...] Designs that use loose parts at the fork are the most dangerous, as they can result in those parts being propelled back towards the shooter's face, such as the ball attachment used in the recalled Daisy [...] "Natural" [...] line of slingshots (see image). The band could slip out of the slot in which it rested, and the hard ball in the tube resulted in cases of blindness and broken teeth. Daisy models using plain tubular bands were not covered in the recall, because the elastic tubing does not cause severe injuries upon failure.|$|R
50|$|The {{width of}} the fork, also called spacing, is {{measured}} colinear with the front wheel axle between the inside edges of the two <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b> Most modern adult sized forks have 100 mm spacing. Downhill mountain bike forks designed for through axles have 110 mm spacing.|$|R
50|$|This trail {{begins at}} Amram's Pillars and leads up Mount Amir, where it forks in two toward either the Israel National Trail {{or through a}} canyon with copper mines. Both <b>forks</b> <b>end</b> near Black Canyon. The trail does not loop, and takes {{approximately}} 4 hours to complete.|$|R
25|$|Track frames {{have much}} in common with road and time trial frames, but come with rear-facing, {{horizontal}} <b>fork</b> <b>ends,</b> rather than dropouts, to allow one to adjust the position of the rear wheel horizontally to set the proper chain tension. Also the seat tube angle is steeper than on road racing bikes.|$|R
5000|$|The North and South forks of the Payette River meet at Banks, {{which makes}} it a popular {{destination}} for people rafting or kayaking on the Payette River. The [...] "Main" [...] run of the Payette River begins at Banks, while the [...] "Staircase" [...] run on the South <b>Fork</b> <b>ends</b> at Banks.|$|R
50|$|The Western Branch Starts between Bar Point and West Point. The branch points northwest. There is the Merry Point cable ferry {{near the}} start of the branch that runs between Ottoman Wharf and Merry Point. In order they are {{encountered}} going up the branch, the creeks are: John Creek, Lowrey Creek, Senior Creek, and Davis Creek. From there, the branch forks into two, the eastern <b>fork</b> <b>ending</b> at Belwood Swamp, approximately one mile west of Lancaster Courthouse, and the western <b>fork,</b> Little Branch, <b>ends</b> at Griffins Landing.|$|R
50|$|The first bicycle wheels {{followed}} {{the traditions of}} carriage building: a wooden hub, a fixed steel axle (the bearings were located in the <b>fork</b> <b>ends),</b> wooden spokes and a shrink fitted iron tire. A typical modern wheel has a metal hub, wire tension spokes and a metal or carbon fiber rim which holds a pneumatic rubber tire.|$|R
60|$|Not {{far from}} the mouth of the cave the ravine forked into two branches, the smaller <b>fork</b> <b>ending</b> at the {{distance}} of quarter of a mile in a cul de sac, or blind pocket. Not knowing she was making any mistake, she entered this fork and kept on running, expecting each instant to find Pawnee Brown coming up behind her.|$|R
25|$|If the tubing label {{has been}} lost, a {{high-quality}} (chromoly or manganese) steel frame can {{be recognized by}} tapping it sharply {{with a flick of}} the fingernail. A high-quality frame will produce a bell-like ring where a regular-quality steel frame will produce a dull thunk. They can also be recognized by their weight (around 2.5kg for frame and forks) and the type of lugs and <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> used.|$|R
5000|$|The Glavers' primary {{organ of}} {{manipulation}} is their prehensile tail, using its <b>forked</b> <b>end</b> to tackle more subtle tasks. However, the tail is weak in musculature, {{and so a}} use remains for the strong forelegs function as rudimentary hands for gripping and manipulation. These are clumsy and unsuited for any task more complicated than grasping a stick or handle and are used to tackle any heavy task the Glaver requires done.|$|R
50|$|In the {{traditional}} form, the hollow {{body of the}} instrument is carved from {{a single piece of}} wood (fir or cedar) around 100 cm long. One end is pointed and the other is forked into two arms which carry a crossbar to hold the tuning mechanism. The soundboard is around 0.5 cm in thickness and covers the whole of the body except the <b>forked</b> <b>end.</b> A bridge is fitted, towards the pointed end of the body. A soundpost is fitted inside the instrument, between the back of the body and the soundboard, to provide support at the position of the bridge. There are typically five strings of tendon or gut. Wood or bone tuning levers are used to tension the strings by pulling them around the crossbar. The strings are tuned diatonically, to a major or minor pentachord. These lyres are also distinguished by the placing of pebbles within the resonating body, causing a rattle. Modern examples may have metal strings, an increased number of strings, tuning pegs or pins, and a body which lacks the <b>forked</b> <b>end.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{aircraft}} {{met with}} an accident on December 24, 2007. The control linkage and the bolt {{recovered from the}} wreckage were forwarded to the laboratory for investigation. From the evidences, it appears most probable that the bolt at the <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> of the lever connecting the tail plane link had come out in air, resulting in loss of control of the aircraft leading to the accident. A detailed analysis is presented in this repor...|$|R
50|$|The ripe fruits are {{harvested}} by climbing {{the tree and}} plucking by hand, alternatively a long stick with a <b>forked</b> <b>end</b> {{may be used to}} twist the fruits off. The pulp is eaten raw and plain or with spices added. It is also cooked and candied or made into marmalade. Grated rind is cooked in coconut milk (with bits of pork and hot pepper) and served as a dish in Bicol, Philippines.|$|R
25|$|The chain stays run {{parallel}} to the chain, connecting the bottom bracket shell to the rear <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> or dropouts. When the rear derailleur cable is routed partially along the down tube, it is also routed along the chain stay. Occasionally (principally on frames made since the late 1990s) mountings for disc brakes will {{be attached to the}} chain stays. There may be a small brace that connects the chain stays in front of the rear wheel and behind the bottom bracket shell.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the valve design for these motors was the double valve guides, and the {{attachment}} of the <b>forked</b> <b>rocker</b> arm to a shoulder between the guides, to eliminate side forces on the valve stem and ensure maximum valve life under racing conditions.|$|R
