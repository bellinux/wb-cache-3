40|$|The present work {{aimed to}} obtain precise {{data on the}} catch of the purse seine net {{operating}} at daytime from sunrise till noon in Abu Qir Bay during 1997 and 1998. Sardine, anchovy, mullet and rabbitfish were <b>recorded</b> <b>as</b> the main <b>target</b> fish groups. Twenty-seven species were <b>recorded</b> <b>as</b> by-catch species. Catch per unit effort {{was estimated to be}} 93 kg/day/boat. The percentage of each target species in the catch and its length frequency distribution were presented. The length range of by-catch species and the season of catch were recorded. Daytime purse seine in Abu Qir Bay is an effective method but should regulated by directing the fishing to deeper waters outside the bay rather than the inshore coastal area to conserve many economic species of this important fishery...|$|R

50|$|Action on {{locating}} hostile artillery {{depends on}} policy and circumstances. In some armies, radars may have authority to send target details to counter-battery fire units and order them to fire, in others they may merely report data to an HQ that then takes action. Modern radars usually <b>record</b> the <b>target</b> <b>as</b> {{well as the}} firing position of hostile artillery. However, this is usually for intelligence purposes because there is seldom time to alert the target with sufficient warning time in a battlefield environment, even with data communications. However, there are exceptions. The new Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR - AN/TPQ 48) is crewed by two soldiers and designed to be deployed inside forward positions, in these circumstances it can immediately alert adjacent troops as well <b>as</b> pass <b>target</b> data to mortars close by for counter-fire. Similar situation for the new GA10 (Ground Alerter 10) radar qualified and successfully deployed by the French land forces in several different FOBs worldwide.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This study {{concerned}} conebeam travel-time tomography. The {{focus was}} on a sparse distribution of signal sources that can be necessary in a challenging in situ environment such as in asteroid tomography. The goal was to approximate the minimum number of source positions needed for robust detection of refractive anomalies, e. g., voids within an asteroid or a casting defects in concrete. Experimental ultrasonic data were <b>recorded</b> utilizing <b>as</b> a <b>target</b> a 150 mm plastic cast cube containing three stones with diameter between 22 and 41 mm. A signal frequency of 55 kHz (35 mm wavelength) was used. Source counts from one to six were tested for different placements. Based on our statistical inversion approach {{and analysis of the}} results, three or four sources were found to lead to reliable inversion. The source configurations investigated were also ranked according to their performance. Our results can be used, for example, in the planning of planetary missions as well as in material testing...|$|R
25|$|At 01:45, Patterson {{detected}} Mikawa's {{ships and}} alerted the Allied force. The Japanese scout planes dropped flares to silhouette Canberra and Chicago. The Australian cruiser {{was able to}} avoid the Japanese torpedoes fired {{at the start of}} the engagement, but was on the receiving end of the Japanese cruisers' gunfire. The first two salvos killed or wounded several senior officers, disabled both engine rooms, damaged the bridge and 4-inch gun platform and forced the flooding of her 8-inch magazines. Within two minutes, the cruiser had been hit 24 times; she was immobilised, without power, and listing to starboard, with multiple internal fires and at least a fifth of her personnel dead or wounded. At least one torpedo strike was reported during the Japanese attack, although none of the 19 torpedoes fired at Canberra by the Japanese cruisers were <b>recorded</b> <b>as</b> hitting their <b>target.</b> Several personnel from Canberra believe that USS Bagley inadvertently torpedoed the cruiser. From the 819-strong ship's company, 84 were killed (74 during the battle, 10 dying later from wounds), and another 109 were wounded.|$|R
40|$|Trypanosoma cruzi, a {{protozoan}} parasite, is the causative {{agent for}} Chagas' disease, which poses serious {{public health problem}} in Latin America. The two drugs available {{for the treatment of}} this disease are effective only against recent infections and are toxic. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) has a proven track <b>record</b> <b>as</b> a drug <b>target.</b> The lipophilic antifolate trimetrexate (TMQ), which is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii infection in AIDS patients, is a potent inhibitor of T. cruzi DHFR activity, with an inhibitory constant of 6. 6 nM. The compound is also highly effective in killing T. cruzi parasites. The 50 and 90 % lethal dose values against the trypomastigote are 19 and 36 nM, and the corresponding values for the amastigote form are 26 and 72 nM, respectively. However, as TMQ is also a good inhibitor of human DHFR, further improvement of the selectivity of this drug would be preferable. Identification of a novel antifolate selective against T. cruzi would open up new therapeutic avenues for treatment of Chagas' disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{fish and}} {{invertebrate}} {{behavior of the}} Ubol Ratana Reservoir, Thailand, were monitored using up- and downlooking split beam sonar located at a fixed location. In the same area and period, ichthyoplankton nets and multimesh gillnets were used. The bulk of targets, recorded by acoustics and direct capture, consisted both of fish 3 – 4 cm long and insect larvae 0. 2 – 1 cm long. Diurnal patterns of behavior were very distinct: during the daytime, invertebrates were hidden in the bottom and most fish stayed in compact shoals. Time course of acoustic fish biomass and abundance was very variable due to shoaling. Only the largest fish were <b>recorded</b> <b>as</b> solitary <b>targets.</b> At night, the whole acoustic range was filled with targets and {{the time course of}} fish biomass (5 – 15 kg ha– 1) and abundance (20 – 45 thousand individuals ha– 1) were more constant. The biomass increased mostly at surface layers. Fish appeared in the evening in the water column 1 h earlier and stayed there in the morning 1 h longer than invertebrates. Dawn and dusk are good periods for studying fish before invertebrates outnumber them. Apart from fish, according to the target strength, swimming speed and depth distribution, at least four groups of water invertebrates were distinguished acoustically, some with extremely fast vertical movement (7 – 9 cm s– 1 vertical speed). Comparison of up- and downlooking observations gave comparable results in midwater layer outside the near-field of the transducer. The uplooking approach can be more suitable for night records; downlooking for the day [KEYWORDS: Acoustics; Echospecies; Target strength; Acoustic tracking and identification; Behavioral pattern...|$|R
5|$|The French ships took shelter at {{the heavily}} {{fortified}} Iles Saint-Marcouf, sailing {{the following morning}} for the anchorage at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue. For two days the British frigates kept watch, until two ships of the line from the blockade of Cherbourg, HMS Donegal and HMS Revenge, arrived. On 15 November, the British squadron attacked the anchored French ships, which were defended by shore batteries at La Hougue and Tatihou. After four attempts to close with the French the British squadron, under heavy fire, withdrew. During the night, the British commander, Captain Pulteney Malcolm, sent his ship's boats close inshore to attack the French ships with Congreve rockets, a newly issued weapon. None are <b>recorded</b> <b>as</b> landing on <b>target,</b> but by morning both frigates {{had been forced to}} change position, becoming grounded on the shore. The French ships were later refloated, and Malcolm's squadron maintained the blockade until 27 November when Amazone successfully escaped back to Le Havre. The damaged Elisa remained at anchor until 6 December, when an attack by a British bomb vessel forced the frigate to move further inshore, becoming grounded once more. Elisa remained in this position until 23 December, when the boats of Diana entered the anchorage at night and set the beached ship on fire, destroying her.|$|R
50|$|While {{poaching}} {{generally is}} not a huge problem for the Sumatrans, occasional local hunting does decrease the population size. They have been hunted in the Northern Sumatra in the past <b>as</b> <b>targets</b> for food; although deliberate attempts to hunt the Sumatrans are rare nowadays, locals such as the Batak people are known to eat almost all vertebrates in their area. Additionally, the Sumatrans are treated as pests by Sumatran farmers, becoming targets of elimination if they are seen damaging or stealing crops.

40|$|This paper evaluates Peter Klein’s {{objection}} to foundationalism.

I then clarify Klein’s concept of arbitrariness. An assertion or belief {{is assumed to be}} arbitrary if and only if it lacks a reason that is “objectively and subjectively available. ” Drawing on this notion, I evaluate Klein’s objection. I first argue that his objection construed <b>as</b> <b>targeting</b> dialectical foundationalism fails, since nothing prevents dialectical foundationalism from ruling out arbitrary assertions. I then argue that the objection seen <b>as</b> <b>targeting</b> epistemic foundationalism cannot be disqualified in the way some foundationalists believe. However, I show that also the objection so construed does not succeed, since epistemic foundationalism need not countenance arbitrary beliefs...|$|R
