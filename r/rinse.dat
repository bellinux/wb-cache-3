40|$|Bone {{defects in}} {{revision}} hip surgery can be reconstructed with impacted morselized bone grafts. <b>Rinsing</b> these trabecular allografts may enhance graft incorporation by washing out immunogenic factors present in blood, marrow, and fat. However, {{it has been}} proposed that impaction of the graft releases biologically active factors, which can provide sufficient activity to stimulate new bone formation. <b>Rinsing</b> before impaction could enhance bone allograft incorporation, but <b>rinsing</b> after impaction could diminish the incorporation process of impacted bone graft. To study the effect of <b>rinsing</b> and impaction of morselized bone grafts on bone ingrowth, a bone chamber study was done in goats. Autografts and allografts were divided into three treatment groups: (A) impacted; (B) <b>rinsed</b> and impacted; and (C) <b>rinsed,</b> impacted, <b>rinsed,</b> and impacted again. Ten goats received three bone chambers in each proximal tibia. The chambers were filled with either allograft or autograft, yielding six different implants per goat. After 6 weeks, histologic analyses were done and bone and tissue ingrowth were measured. New bone and total tissue ingrowth were higher in autografts than in allografts, especially in the nonrinsed group. With <b>rinsing,</b> total tissue ingrowth increased in the allograft group to approach that of autografts. <b>Rinsing</b> after impaction did not additionally alter bone ingrowth.

40|$|Background. Significant {{increases}} in intracranial pressure (ICP) may occur during neuroendoscopic procedures. To detect and prevent serious and sustained increases, ICP should be monitored. At present, controversy {{exists on the}} optimal location of the monitoring sensor. Therefore, we conducted an in vitro study to estimate the pressure gradients between the ventricle, the 'gold standard' site, and the <b>rinsing</b> inlet and outlet. Methods. A head model and a standard endoscope were used. <b>Rinsing</b> was enforced by using a pressurized infusion bag. Using clinically relevant flow rates, pressure was measured at the <b>rinsing</b> inlet and outlet, in the ventricle, and at the distal end of the <b>rinsing</b> channel using a tip sensor or a capillary tube. Results. At a flow of 61 ml min(- 1), the steady-state pressures measured at the <b>rinsing</b> inlet, in the ventricle, and at the <b>rinsing</b> outlet were 38, 26, and 12 mm Hg, respectively. At 135 ml min(- 1), these increased to 136, 89, and 42 mm Hg. Transendoscopic pressure measurements were always within 1 mm Hg of the ventricular pressure. Conclusions. During endoscopy, measurements at the <b>rinsing</b> inlet overestimated the ventricular pressure by similar to 50 mm Hg during heavy <b>rinsing,</b> whereas measurements at the <b>rinsing</b> outlet underestimated the pressure by similar to 50 mm Hg. An electronic tip sensor or a pressure capillary tube placed at the distal end of the lumen of the <b>rinsing</b> channel of the endoscope did not interfere with <b>rinsing</b> flow and produced measurements that were equal to ventricular pressures...|$|R
40|$|While oral <b>rinses</b> {{used for}} {{cosmetic}} purposes only {{do not necessarily}} have to be antiseptic, antimicrobial activity is required for medical indications, including oral and periodontal surgery. So the question arises—is the antimicrobial activity of oral <b>rinses</b> associated with any destructive changes in cell viability in vitro? To answer this question, we examined twelve oral <b>rinses</b> {{with respect to their}} antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity. Antimicrobial activity was screened against five bacterial strains using disc diffusion. Cytotoxicity was determined by mitochondrial reductase activity with primary gingival fibroblasts, L 929 cells, and HSC- 2 epithelial cells. Phase contrast microscopy and trypan blue staining were then performed to reveal cell morphology. Cells remained vital after exposure to oral <b>rinses</b> that were only used for cosmetic purposes. Moderate cytotoxic effects were observed for oral <b>rinses</b> containing 0. 05 % chlorhexidine, ethanol, or pegylated hydrogenated castor oil and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Other oral <b>rinses</b> containing 0. 2 % chlorhexidine and cocamidopropyl betaine exhibited strong cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity. Strong cytotoxic but moderate antimicrobial activity was observed in oral <b>rinses</b> containing cetylpyridinium chloride. The in vitro data show that oral <b>rinses</b> are heterogeneous with respect to their cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects. Based on their respective properties, oral <b>rinses</b> can be selected either to reduce the microbial load or for cosmetic purposes...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: High {{doses of}} inhaled {{corticosteroids}} are absorbed systemically and may cause long term side effects. As <b>rinsing</b> the mouth out after use and inhaling through a spacing device may reduce systemic absorption {{this has been}} further investigated. METHODS: Three crossover {{studies were carried out}} to assess the effect of budesonide given by dry powder inhaler (Turbuhaler) with and without mouth <b>rinsing</b> and beclomethasone dipropionate given by metered dose inhaler with or without a spacing device (Volumatic) on serum cortisol concentrations and urinary cortisol excretion in patients with asthma taking an inhaled corticosteroid. Each treatment period was two weeks with in a two week washout period. Serum cortisol concentrations at 0800 hours on day 14 and the 24 hour urinary excretion of cortisol were measured. In study 1 24 patients taking beclomethasone dipropionate 500 micrograms twice a day inhaled with (n = 10) or without (n = 14) a Volumatic spacing device were switched to a budesonide dry powder inhaler, 600 micrograms to be taken twice a day without mouth <b>rinsing.</b> In study 2 10 patients took budesonide 800 micrograms twice a day with and without mouth <b>rinsing</b> and without swallowing the <b>rinsing</b> water. In study 3 17 patients took budesonide 800 micrograms twice daily with mouth <b>rinsing</b> and beclomethasone dipropionate 500 micrograms twice daily with the spacing device and mouth <b>rinsing.</b> RESULTS: In study 1 no difference was seen between budesonide without mouth <b>rinsing</b> and beclomethasone dipropionate without a spacer: beclomethasone with spacer caused less suppression of cortisol (mean (SD) serum cortisol concentration: beclomethasone and spacer 487 (148), budesonide 368 (145) nmol/l). In study 2 mouth <b>rinsing</b> caused less suppression of morning serum cortisol concentrations (<b>rinsing</b> 440 (63), no <b>rinsing</b> 375 (56) nmol/ 1). In study 3 {{there was no difference in}} serum or urinary cortisol concentrations between twice daily beclomethasone dipropionate 500 micrograms inhaled by Volumatic spacer or budesonide by Turbuhaler 800 micrograms twice daily, both with mouth <b>rinsing.</b> Individual serum cortisol values were within the normal range in all patients except one in study 1.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Gamma {{irradiation}} {{has been}} widely used for sterilization of bone allografts. However, gamma irradiation alters proteins. This is favorable when it reduces immunogenicity, but is undesirable when osteoinductive proteins are damaged. Although the effect of gamma irradiation on BMPs has been studied, the effect of irradiation {{on the process of}} incorporation of morselized bone chips remains unclear. We studied the effects of sterilization by gamma irradiation on the incorporation of impacted morselized allografts. METHODS: Bone chambers with impacted allografts, <b>rinsed</b> impacted allografts, allografts that were <b>rinsed</b> and subsequently irradiated, and an empty control were implanted in proximal medial tibiae of goats. Incorporation was evaluated using histology and histomorphometry. RESULTS: Histology revealed evidence of bone graft incorporation, which proceeded in a similar way in unprocessed, <b>rinsed,</b> and both <b>rinsed</b> and irradiated bone grafts. After 12 weeks, no difference in bone and tissue ingrowth was found between the unprocessed, the <b>rinsed,</b> and the <b>rinsed</b> and subsequently irradiated allografts. The amount of unresorbed graft remnant was highest in the unprocessed bone grafts. INTERPRETATION: We conclude that sterilization with gamma irradiation does not influence the incorporation of impacted <b>rinsed</b> bone allografts...|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE Stable isotope ratios {{are widely}} used to infer trophic relationships, {{although}} {{a growing number of}} studies show that sample pre-treatments (such as acidification to remove carbonates) can cause changes in isotope ratios. Samples are often <b>rinsed</b> in distilled water after acidification, and we examine the effects of this step in particular on the isotope ratios of marine invertebrate samples. METHODS Samples of whole hermit crabs (Paguridae) were subjected to one of three treatments: acidification using dilute hydrochloric acid without subsequent distilled water rinsing; acidification with rinsing; and <b>rinsing</b> with no acidification. Continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry was used to compare the mean carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of treated and untreated material. RESULTS Acidification (both with and without subsequent distilled water <b>rinsing)</b> resulted in reductions in mean ? 13 C values (1. 939 and 3. 146 ‰, respectively), while <b>rinsing</b> without prior acidification led to a smaller (but still significant) increase. Nitrogen isotope ratios were not affected by acidification, but subsequent <b>rinsing</b> with distilled water caused a decrease of approximately 1 ‰. CONCLUSIONS Acidification of samples is clearly necessary in the presence of carbonates to obtain useful carbon isotope ratio data. However, post-acidification <b>rinsing</b> can result in further (potentially undesirable) changes to both carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. Ideally, <b>rinsing</b> should be avoided, but the impacts are small enough to be of little concern in many studies. <b>Rinsing</b> (or not) should be considered carefully {{on the basis of the}} aims of a study...|$|R
