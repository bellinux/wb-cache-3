40|$|Thesis (MEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2007. ENGLISH: The design, {{construction}} {{and testing of}} a passive thermal system, a roof solar chimney, for a loft is considered. Unlike conventional solar chimneys the solar collector is constructed from corrugated iron roof sheets with the aim {{that it can be}} integrated into existing buildings at a lower cost or used in low cost housing developments. The main objective {{of the study was to}} determine the feasibility of such low-cost design to regulate thermal conditions in a loft, that is heating the loft during winter and enhancing natural ventilation during summer, by carrying out an experimental and analytical study. The results obtained from the experimental study showed that for winter the solar chimney, having a channel width, depth and length of 0. 7 m, 0. 1 m and 1. 8 m respectively and with a peal solar radiation of 850 W/m², heated the room air 5 °C higher than the ambient temperature during the hottest periods of the day, which is only marginally better than a loft with conventional roof insulation. At night, it was found that reverse airflow occurred through the chimney, cooling the loft down to ambient temperature, due to radiation heat loss from the <b>roof</b> <b>collector</b> to the night sky. For summer operation, the experimental data showed that the chimney was able to maintain the loft at ambient temperature and the analytical study found that the chimney was able to enhance natural ventilation effectively, reaching air exchange rate of 6. 6 per hour for the 4. 6 m³ volume space. It was also found that the chimney’s performance dropped rapidly and significantly during periods of low solar radiation and at night. A sensitivity analysis illustrated that for both summer and winter operation, the size, tilt angle and absorptivity of the <b>roof</b> <b>collector</b> greatly effected the efficiency and mass flow rates of the system, agreeing well with other literature. These results prove that this low cost solar chimney cooling design was feasible to enhance natural ventilation mainly during hot summer conditions with high solar radiation. Compared to a loft with only conventional roof insulation, the chimney did not perform effectively during the winter to heat the loft up, meaning that winter operation for this specific design is not feasible. Possible improvements to the design include using construction materials with higher thermal capacities to retain heat energy and ensure continued operation during periods of low solar radiation, as well as using selective absorber coatings on the collector surface. It is recommended that further work on the project include the integration of these improvements into the present design and to use the findings obtained from the sensitivity analysis to improve system efficiencies. CFD analysis of the test-rig will be insightful as an additional means to validate and compare with the analytical and experimental data obtained in this report. With the continuation of these studies, this low-cost solar chimney design can be optimised, validated on a commercial scale and built into existing and new housing developments. Incorporating such a passive thermal device will aid homeowners in air regulation and thermal comfort of their living space as well as saving on energy requirements.

40|$|The flows {{induced by}} natural {{convection}} appear in many engineering problems. Configurations formed by heated plates where these processes occur, were {{the topic of}} intense study in past years. However, new systems with a different constructive disposition and applications in several fields (bioclimatic architecture, electronic cooling, nuclear energy cooling systems) are {{at the moment of}} great interest. Since typical applications of buoyancy-driven airflows in smooth vertical channels are usually in small-scale devices (i. e. in electronic cooling equipment), most investigations were carried out for laminar flows. As a consequence of the great scale of certain passive ventilation systems, as solar chimneys, Trombe walls, or <b>roof</b> <b>collectors,</b> the flow established becomes transitional or even fully turbulent. The regarded geometries frequently involve structures based on converging and sloped channels formed by heated plates, where buoyancy-driven flows take place. Therefore, the study of problems such as the transition to turbulent regime or flows with walled-channel geometries including sloped and converging walls are key to assertively find out the real heating transmission existing in these new systems in a more realistic manner. Nowadays, the need to achieve human comfort by passive heating and ventilation techniques is greater as is the requirement for energy saving. Passive solar systems are the basic elements of bioclimatic design and they do not involve the use of mechanical or electrical devices. The Trombe Wall is the primary example of the technique called indirect gain, whose typical configuration is usually formed by a thick, darkened, masonry wall and a glazed wall. In ventilation applications, other passive systems, called thermosyphons, heat syphons or solar chimneys, can yield natural motions of air due to the induced temperature differences by solar heating. Although several reported works provided useful results for the analysis and design of passive solar devices in buildings, these works cannot determine the necessary details of convection for numerical simulations. Furthermore, as an important lack of design correlations is detected, it is necessary to carry out a systematic study that supplied the heat transfer coefficient and the mass-flow rate as a function of relevant parameters, for several configurations...|$|R
