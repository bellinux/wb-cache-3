25|$|Quality {{life jackets}} always provide more {{buoyancy}} than {{offered by the}} buoyancy aids alone. The positioning of the buoyancy on the wearer's torso is such that a <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> (rotational force) results that will eventually turn most persons who are floating {{face down in the}} water (for example, because they are unconscious) into a face up orientation with their bodies inclined backward, unlike more simply designed common foam buoyancy vests.|$|E
25|$|Other proa {{designers}} {{blur the}} lines between Atlantic and Pacific style proas. The Harryproa from Australia uses a long, thin hull to lee, and a short, fat hull, containing the cabin, to windward. This would normally be more like an Atlantic proa, but the rig is on the lee hull, leaving it technically a Pacific design. This and other similar proas place {{the bulk of the}} passenger accommodations on the ama, in an attempt to make the vaka as streamlined as possible, and put much of the mass in the lee side to provide a greater <b>righting</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
25|$|In geometry, a {{body with}} a single stable resting {{position}} is called monostatic, and the term mono-monostatic has been coined to describe a body which additionally has only one unstable point of balance. (The previously known monostatic polyhedron does not qualify, as it has three unstable equilibria.) A sphere weighted so that its center of mass is shifted from the geometrical center is a mono-monostatic body. A more common example is the Comeback Kid, Weeble or roly-poly toy (see left figure). Not only {{does it have a}} low center of mass, but it also has a specific shape. At equilibrium, the center of mass and the contact point are on the line perpendicular to the ground. When the toy is pushed, its center of mass rises and also shifts away from that line. This produces a <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> which returns the toy to the equilibrium position.|$|E

2500|$|After sailing for 31 years, she {{was deemed}} superannuated. [...] The ship {{would no longer}} {{transport}} iron ore, and instead was retrofitted as a carrier of stone aggregate. [...] This 1923–1924 refit included the installation of topside self-unloading gear, which affected her center of gravity and <b>righting</b> <b>moment.</b> [...] As wreck discoverer David Trotter stated: [...] "We found that the self-unloading mechanism was still in position, and that was an interesting discovery because we now realize that the unloading mechanism didn’t break free, causing the Clifton to have instability, resulting in her sinking." [...] The self-unloading machinery [...] "was added the same year she disappeared," [...] responded maritime expert Valerie Van Heest. She said the discovery has many levels of significance. She said, [...] "All of it was additional weight above the center line of the vessel", {{and that it was}} not coincidental that three other ships outfitted with an identical self-unloading system all sank.. [...] Four of the refitted ships were lost in relatively quick progression.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the design}} {{elements}} which Brown used, {{and a number of}} other designers have copied, is the lee pod. [...] The akas extend past the main hull and out to the lee side, and provide support for a cabin extending to the lee of the main hull. [...] This is similar to the platform extending to the lee on some Micronesian proas. [...] The lee pod serves two purposes—it can be used for bunk space or storage, and it provides additional buoyancy on the lee side to prevent a capsize should the boat heel too far. [...] Crew can also be moved onto the lee pod to provide additional heeling force in light winds, allowing the ama to lift under circumstances when it would not otherwise. The Jzero also used water ballast in the ama to allow the <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> to be significantly increased if needed. While Brown's proa was designed to be a cruising yacht, not a speed-sailing boat, the newer [...] Jzero is capable of speeds of up to [...]|$|E
2500|$|Most small monohull sailboats can {{normally}} be righted by standing or pulling {{down on the}} centreboard, daggerboard (or bilgeboard in a [...] ) to lift the mast clear of the water. Depending {{on the design of}} the hull, the boat's <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> will normally take effect once the mast is around 30 degrees from horizontal and help pull the boat vertical. Righting a catamaran that is lying on its side involves using a righting line fed over the upper hull. The crew stands on the lower hull and pulls back on the righting line. In small catamarans such as the Hobie 16 it is imperative that at least one crew member assumes this task as soon as possible as there is a chance that the boat will turtle and then become extremely difficult to recover without assistance. Some monohulls and catamarans [...] use a small flotation device mounted {{at the tip of the}} mast or mainsail to ensure that the craft cannot assume an inverted position, or at least that a fully inverted position is not stable (i.e. it would come to a position where the mast is lying on the surface of the water, which would be preferable to fully inverted).|$|E

5000|$|The {{weight of}} the entire boat is 1180 kilograms, {{including}} the hull and standing rigging.

50|$|The {{traditional}} fin keel, pointing {{straight down}} from the boat, provides no <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> when the boat is level. The heeling force of the wind on the sails is therefore not counteracted until the boat has heeled over by a certain amount, moving the fixed keel to windward of the centerline. The purpose of the canting keel is to allow the boat to sail closer to level which generates maximum speed, by swinging the keel to windward and developing an adequate <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> to keep the boat's angle of heel closer to level.|$|E
50|$|The {{subsequent}} {{investigation on}} {{the loss of}} Captain, {{in the form of}} a court-martial, under Sir James Hope, took place on board HMS Duke of Wellington, in Portsmouth Harbour. It was somewhat of a departure for the Admiralty to seek scientific advice, but eminent engineers William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) and William John Macquorn Rankine were appointed to the enquiry. It concluded that the ship was insufficiently stable: at 14 degrees heel (when the edge of the deck touched the sea) the <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> (torque) due to the buoyancy pushing the ship upright again was just 410-foot-tons (1.2 MN·m). HMS Monarch, the masted turret ship proposed by the 1865 committee and designed by Reed, and which was in the area at the time of the sinking, had a <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> of 6,500-foot-tons (20 MN·m) at the same angle. Maximum <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> occurred at a heel of 21 degrees, and thereafter declined to zero at 54.5 degrees. Monarch's <b>righting</b> <b>moment</b> increased to a maximum at 40 degrees. Survivors testified that the Captain floated upside down for between three and ten minutes, which proved that the ship had capsized. An inclining test had been carried out at Portsmouth on 29 July 1870 to allow the ship's stability characteristics to be calculated. Captain set sail on the ship's final voyage before the results of the trial were published.|$|E
