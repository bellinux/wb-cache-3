40|$|In {{the present}} study we have {{examined}} how the European chemicals regulation Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation <b>and</b> Restriction of Chemicals (<b>REACH)</b> has influenced occupational risk management of chemicals at Swedish downstream user companies. The data were collected through interviews with {{occupational health and safety}} professionals, safety representatives and authority employees. The results show that most of the informants had scarce knowledge about <b>REACH</b> <b>and</b> that <b>REACH</b> <b>implementation</b> has not had any major impacts on downstream users’ occupational risk management, but the impacts the regulation has had were perceived as positive. For instance, clear substance identification and increased hazard information were appreciated improvements of safety data sheets (SDS). However, with regards to identifying how to safely use a substance or product neither the SDSs nor the attached exposure scenarios were perceived as sufficient. REACH was not perceived as a major driver for substitution but has had some impact on substitution, either by requiring it for certain substances as through the authorisation procedure or facilitating the identification of relevant substances to substitute as more information on hazards has become available. The obstacles to <b>REACH</b> <b>implementation</b> {{are similar to those of}} occupational health and safety legislation; lack of awareness, understanding and/or incentives to take action. Especially smaller companies with their limited resources lag behind. Reaching the full potential of REACH requires more work on motivating and supporting downstream users to fulfil their REACH obligations. QC 20150901 </p...|$|R

We find that in addition to the initial setup costs for compliance, EU RoHS <b>and</b> <b>REACH</b> <b>implementation</b> causes firms to incur additional variable production costs by requiring additional labor and capital expenditures of around 12 % of the variable costs, respectively. We also find that compliance with RoHS <b>and</b> <b>REACH</b> significantly increases the probability of export.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{examine the}} impact of the new Canadian tobacco package warning labels with a quitline {{toll-free}} phone number for seven provincial quitlines, focusing on treatment <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> <b>reach</b> equity in selected vulnerable groups. MethodsA quasi-experimental design assessed changes in new incoming caller characteristics, treatment reach for selected vulnerable sub-populations {{and the extent to which}} this <b>reach</b> is equitable, before <b>and</b> after the introduction of the labels in June, 2012. Administrative call data on smokers were collected at intake. Pre- <b>and</b> post-label treatment <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> <b>reach</b> equity differences were analysed by comparing the natural logarithms of the <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> <b>reach</b> equity statistics. ResultsDuring the six months following the introduction of the new warning labels, 86. 4 % of incoming new callers indicated seeing the quitline number on the labels. Treatment reach for the six-month period significantly improved compared to the same six-month period the year before from. 042 % to. 114 % (p<. 0001) <b>and</b> <b>reach</b> equity significantly improved for young males (p<. 0001) and those with high school education or less (p=. 004). ConclusionsThe introduction of the new tobacco warning labels with a quitline toll-free number in Canada was associated with an increase in treatment reach. The toll-free number on tobacco warning labels aided in reducing tobacco related inequalities, such as improved reach equity for young males and those with high school or less education...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2014. Major: Rehabilitation Science. Advisor: Paula M. Ludewig, PhD. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xv, 247 pages, appendices 1 - 25. The elderly population {{are at risk}} of having shoulder pain and dysfunction. One possible contributor to shoulder impairment is abnormal scapulothoracic and glenohumeral motion. Comparing the elderly and young age groups based on changes in kinematics and thoracic posture during completion of day-to-day functional tasks is not well understood. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare three-dimensional shoulder kinematics, thoracic posture and shoulder strength between asymptomatic elderly and young individuals. Subjects included 50 asymptomatic right dominant, gender and BMI matched individuals equally divided into young (20 to 40 years) and elderly (above 65 years) groups. A 3 D electromagnetic motion capture system was used to record scapulothoracic and glenohumeral angular positions during scapular plane abduction, forward reach, reaching the back, <b>reaching</b> the wallet <b>and</b> touching the head tasks. Kinematics were computed at 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % of the humeral angular motions. A 3 D CT based reconstructed anatomical model was animated based on group mean motion data to compute the minimum linear distance from rotator cuff footprints to potential impinging structures. Thoracic posture in static and dynamic conditions was measured for flexion-extension. Isometric shoulder strength was measured in four directions with a portable dynamometer and strength ratios were computed. Significant kinematic differences between groups were present for humerothoracic elevation range of motion, scapular internal rotation during scapular plane abduction, scapular upward rotation during forward reach, glenohumeral external rotation during forward reach, scapular internal rotation during reaching the back, scapular posterior tilt during <b>reaching</b> the back <b>and</b> scapular internal rotation during reaching the wallet. The mean differences between groups were less than 8 ° with the exception of glenohumeral external rotation (< 19 °) during the forward reach task. Overall, relative to the number of comparisons, few group differences existed for the tested conditions and those that were different had small magnitude. It was believed that these differences represent natural consequences of aging even in the absence of shoulder pain or dysfunction. Minimum linear distance was reduced in the elderly for forward <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> <b>reaching</b> the wallet tasks. It was believed, however, that position was the issue during reaching the wallet task since both groups had submillimeter minimum distances for that task. Significant dynamic thoracic flexion-extension differences between groups existed for <b>reaching</b> the back <b>and</b> <b>reaching</b> the wallet tasks. However, the magnitudes of the differences between groups were less than 2 °, so it was thought that these differences were not clinically meaningful. Significant reduction in shoulder strength for the elderly group was evident in flexion, abduction, external rotation and internal rotation directions, but strength ratios were similar for both the groups. Based on the findings it was assumed that forward <b>reach</b> <b>and</b> possibly <b>reaching</b> the wallet tasks may benefit from further investigation due to the possibility of higher potential for rotator cuff compression in the elderly group. Maintaining strength ratios may be protective for developing rotator cuff disease. Modification of the forward <b>reaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>reaching</b> the wallet tasks may be considered while planning shoulder intervention strategies for the elderly...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to study the ranges in height, weight, age, spike <b>reach,</b> <b>and</b> block <b>reach</b> of volleyball players in {{relation}} to the player position and the level of their respective teams in peak performance. The analysed sample included 1454 male and 1452 female players who participated in the volleyball competitions of the Olympic Games and World Championships in the 2000 - 2012 period. A descriptive, correlational, and longitudinal design was used. The variables studied were: the player position, body height, weight, body mass index, spike <b>reach,</b> block <b>reach,</b> age, <b>and</b> team level. The results show differences between body height, spike <b>and</b> block <b>reaches,</b> <b>and</b> the age of the players by their position. These differences are related {{to the needs of the}} different positions with regard to the actions they execute. Middle-blockers, outside-hitters, and opposites have the characteristics that are most suitable for blocking and spiking, and the setters and liberos appear to have characteristics conducive to setting and receiving as well as digging, respectively. The differences found in the studied variables with regard to the playing position are related to players' needs regarding the actions they perform. Player´s age was a variable that differentiated first teams at this level of competition for males, and physical capacities (body height, weight, spike <b>reach,</b> <b>and</b> block <b>reach)</b> were variables that differentiated first teams at this level of competition for females...|$|R
