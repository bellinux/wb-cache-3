5|$|Argentina {{fell into}} a deep {{recession}} {{in the second half of}} 1998, triggered and then compounded by a series of adverse external shocks, which included low prices for agricultural commodities, the appreciation of the US dollar, to which the peso was pegged at par, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the LTCM crisis and the devaluation of the Brazilian <b>real</b> <b>in</b> January 1999. Argentina did not enjoy a rapid recovery, and the sluggishness of GDP growth fuelled concerns about the sustainability of public debt.|$|E

5|$|Flashback is {{the fifth}} studio album by Puerto Rican reggaetón {{recording}} artist Ivy Queen, released on October 4, 2005 through Univision and on September 15, 2007 as Greatest Hits in Germany and Spain. It is often considered as a studio-compilation release due {{to the amount of}} the album being previously released material. Queen began working on Flashback after the moderate success of <b>Real</b> <b>in</b> early 2005. Featuring content dating back to 1995, when she was still a part of the all-male group The Noise, the album includes four new pieces of work all produced by Rafi Mercenario, the genre's most requested record producer at the time.|$|E
5|$|From I-5 to I-15, SR76 {{is part of}} the California Freeway and Expressway System, but is {{not part}} of the National Highway System, a network of {{highways}} that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR76 is legally eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. The part of the highway from the western terminus to Douglas Drive is also named for Tony Zeppetella, an Oceanside police officer killed while on duty performing a traffic stop in 2003. In 2014, SR76 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 1,400 between East Palomar Road and the eastern terminus at SR79, and 55,000 between Airport Road and El Camino <b>Real</b> <b>in</b> Oceanside, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.|$|E

In December 1187, an Ayyubid army consisting of the garrisons of Saladin and his brothers from Aleppo, Hama, and Egypt besieged Tyre. Half of the Muslim naval fleet was seized by Conrad's forces on 29 December, {{followed by}} an Ayyubid defeat on the shoreline of the city. On 1 January 1188, Saladin held a war council where a withdrawal from Tripoli was agreed.|$|E

Impact from the storm was thus limited to intermittent downpours and 8ft (2.4m) waves along the southern coast. The rough seas caused some minor erosion to beach facilities. According to {{a report from the}} United States Geological Survey (USGS), a maximum of 5.54in (141mm) of rain fell near Río Cerrillos in Ponce, though the highest measurement from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) was 4.60in (117mm) at Puerto <b>Real</b> <b>in</b> Cabo Rojo.

5|$|The {{population}} of Auxois is very low, {{and it is}} one of the rarest of the nine French draft horse breeds. In 2001, it had the eighth-smallest {{population of}} the nine breeds, making the threats of inbreeding and extinction very <b>real.</b> <b>In</b> 2006, 250 active breeding mares and 32 stallions were reported, with 125 breeders (the term breeder applying to any person owning at least one active breeding mare). The Auxois represented 1 percent of total French draft horse registrations in 2007. Burgundy is by far the main breeding area, with a few horses in the Rhône-Alpes and Auvergne regions. There are no known registered Auxois living outside France and it is almost unknown outside of its home region, even within the rest of France. Of the nine French draft horse breeds, the Auxois is the only one that is not exported. Between 1992 and 2011, between 80 and 146 foals were born each year, with numbers ranging from 105 to 128 between 2007 and 2011.|$|E

5|$|As per Tulsidas, Rama is the {{efficient}} and material cause (Nimitta and Upadana) of the world, which is real since Rama is <b>real.</b> <b>In</b> several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas {{says that the}} animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses to mean {{that the world is}} real according to Tulsidas, in keeping with the Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja. However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is Mithya (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses to mean that in Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the Vivartavada doctrine of Adi Shankara, while some others interpret them to mean that the world is transient yet real as per the Satkhyativada doctrine of Ramananda. Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to Maya. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by Mithya.|$|E
5|$|In 1542, the New Laws {{were issued}} {{with the aim}} of {{protecting}} the indigenous peoples of the Spanish colonies from their overexploitation by the encomenderos. Friar Bartolomé de las Casas and his followers left Spain in July 1544 to enforce the New Laws. Las Casas arrived in Ciudad Real with 16 fellow Dominicans on 12 March 1545. The Dominicans were the first religious order to attempt the evangelisation of the native population. Their arrival meant that the colonists were no longer free to treat the natives as they saw fit without the risk of intervention by the religious authorities. The Dominicans soon came into conflict with the established colonists. Colonial opposition to the Dominicans was such that the Dominicans were forced to flee Ciudad <b>Real</b> <b>in</b> fear of their lives. They established themselves nearby in two indigenous villages, the old site of Villa Real de Chiapa and Cinacantlán. From Villa Real, Bartolomé de las Casas and his companions prepared for the evangelisation of all the territory that fell within the Bishopric of Chiapa. The Dominicans promoted the veneration of Santiago Matamoros (St. James the Moor-slayer) as a readily identifiable image of Spanish military superiority. The Dominicans soon saw the need to reestablish themselves in Ciudad Real, and the hostilities with the colonists were calmed. In 1547, the first stone for the new Dominican convent in Ciudad Real was placed.|$|E
5|$|The Dominicans {{soon came}} into {{conflict}} with the established colonists. They refused to take confessions or give sacraments to Spaniards who mistreated Indians, and {{even went so far}} as to imprison a dean and excommunicate the president of the Audiencia Real. Colonial opposition to the actions of the Dominicans reached such dangerous levels that the Dominicans were forced to flee Ciudad <b>Real</b> <b>in</b> fear of their lives. They established themselves nearby in two indigenous villages, the old site of Villa Real de Chiapa and Cinacantlán. Las Casas based himself in the former, and friar Tomás Casillas took charge of Cinacantlán. From Villa Real, Bartolomé de las Casas and his companions prepared for the evangelisation of all the territory that fell within the Bishopric of Chiapa. The territory of Chiapas was subdivided into a number of regions based on prehispanic divisions; these were the Chiapaneca, Lakandon, Mokaya, Tojolabal, Tzeltal, and Zoque. The Dominicans promoted the veneration of Santiago Matamoros (St. James the Moor-slayer) as a readily identifiable image of Spanish military superiority.|$|E
