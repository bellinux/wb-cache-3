The combination tool was created in 1905 by Malcolm McLeod, a US Forest Service ranger at the Sierra National Forest, with a large sharpened hoe-like blade {{on one side and}} a tined <b>rake</b> <b>blade</b> on the other.|$|E
500|$|In 1783, two of Evans's {{brothers}} {{began building}} a mill in Newport {{on part of}} the family's farm estate which they purchased from their father, and Evans was recruited to oversee its construction on the Red Clay Creek. When the mill opened in 1785 it was of a conventional design, {{but over the next}} five years Evans began to experiment with inventions to reduce the reliance upon labor for milling. Moving wheat from the bottom to the top of the mill to begin the process was the most onerous task of all in contemporary mills. Evans's first innovation was a bucket elevator to facilitate this process. Chains of buckets to raise water was a Roman technology had been used in various guises since antiquity. Evans had seen diagrams of their use for marine applications and realized with some modification and careful engineering they could be used to raise grain, so a series of bucket elevators around a mill could move grain and flour from one process to the next. Another labor-intensive task was that of spreading meal. This came out of the grinding process warm and moist, needing cooling and drying before it could be sifted and packed. Traditionally the task was done by manually shoveling meal across large floors. In response, Evans developed the [...] "hopper boy", a device which gathered meal from a bucket elevator and spread it evenly over the drying floor—a mechanical rake would revolve around the floorspace. [...] This would even out newly deposited meal for cooling and drying, while a gentle incline in the design of the <b>rake</b> <b>blades</b> would slowly move the flour towards central chutes, from which the material would be sifted. Used in conjunction, the two innovations saved many hours of labor and greatly reduced the risk of contamination.|$|R
50|$|According to J. Hall (1970), in Ontario at least, {{the most}} widely used site {{preparation}} technique was post-harvest mechanical scarification by equipment front-mounted on a bulldozer (<b>blade,</b> <b>rake,</b> V-plow, or teeth), or dragged behind a tractor (Imsett or S.F.I. scarifier, or rolling chopper). Drag type units designed and constructed by Ontario's Department of Lands and Forests used anchor chain or tractor pads separately or in combination, or were finned steel drums or barrels of various sizes and used in sets alone or combined with tractor pad or anchor chain units.|$|R
60|$|The old wizard took up {{the little}} assegai which he had offered to me and with its <b>blade</b> <b>raked</b> our ashes from the fire that always burnt in front of him. While he did so, he talked to me, as I thought in a random fashion, perhaps to {{distract}} my attention, of a certain white man whom he said I should meet upon my journey and of his affairs, also of other matters, none of which interested me much at the time. These ashes he patted down flat and then on them drew a map with the point of his spear, making grooves for streams, certain marks for bush and forest, wavy lines for water and swamps and little heaps for hills.|$|R
50|$|A {{good quality}} lauter tun has {{rotating}} rake arms {{with a central}} drive unit. Depending {{on the size of}} the lauter tun, there can be between two and six <b>rake</b> arms. Cutting <b>blades</b> hang from these arms. The blade is usually wavy and has a plough-like foot. Each blade has its own path around the tun and the whole rake assembly can be raised and lowered. Attached to each of these arms is a flap which can be raised and lowered for pushing the spent grains out of the tun. The brewer, or better yet an automated system, can raise and lower the rake arms depending on the turbidity (cloudiness) of the run-off, and the tightness of the grain bed, as measured by the pressure difference between the top and bottom of the grain bed.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThis paper {{presents}} a numerical optimization method {{to improve the}} performance of the propeller with Turbo-Ring using real-coded genetic algorithm. In the presented method, Unimodal Normal Distribution Crossover (UNDX) and Minimal Generation Gap (MGG) model are used as crossover operator and generation-alternation model, respectively. Propeller characteristics are evaluated by a simple surface panel method “SQCM” in the optimization process. Blade sections of the original Turbo-Ring and propeller are replaced by the NACA 66 a = 0. 8 section. However, original chord, skew, <b>rake</b> and maximum <b>blade</b> thickness distributions in the radial direction are unchanged. Pitch and maximum camber distributions in the radial direction are selected as the design variables. Optimization is conducted to maximize the efficiency of the propeller with Turbo-Ring. The experimental result shows that the efficiency of the optimized propeller with Turbo-Ring is higher than that of the original propeller with Turbo-Ring...|$|R
5000|$|The machine used {{is called}} a {{squaring}} shear, power shear, or guillotine. The machine may be foot powered, less commonly hand powered, or mechanically or hydraulically powered. It works by first clamping the material with a ram. A moving blade then comes down across a fixed blade to shear the material. For larger shears the moving blade may be set on an angle or [...] "rocked" [...] in order to shear the material progressively {{from one side to}} the other; this angle is referred to as the shear angle. Setting the blade on an angle decreases the amount of force required, but increases the stroke. A 5 degree shear angle decreases the force by about 20%. The amount of energy used is still the same. The moving blade may also be inclined 0.5 to 2.5°, called the rake angle, to keep the material from becoming wedged between the <b>blades.</b> However, <b>raking</b> the <b>blade</b> compromises the squareness of the edge. The machine consists of a shear table, work-holding device, upper and lower blades, and a gauging device. The shear table is the part of the machinery that the workpiece rests on while being sheared. The work-holding device is used to hold the workpiece in place and keep it from moving or buckling while under stress. The upper and lower blades are the piece of machinery that actually do the cutting, while the gauging device is used to ensure that the workpiece is being cut where it is supposed to be.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWith the {{development}} of dry high vacuum pump, researches of pumping mechanism of vortex-stage are greatly concerned. This paper presents a horizontal dry high vacuum pump and establishes a numerical model of vortex stage. And then numerical simulation of flow is carried out with FLUENT software. Moreover, it studies how flow regions work on the internal flow and work performance of the vortex stage under various conditions, such as different number of blades and impeller with different <b>blade</b> <b>rake.</b> As a result, numerical simulation shows {{that there is a}} large impact on the pumping for different numbers of blades distributed on the impeller, the number of blades of single impeller should be obtained by combining with practical design sizes. In fact, this paper selects the best number of blades as forty-three by calculating and optimizing. In the mean time, there are three cases for the blade rake: pitched vanes, radial vanes and retroverted vanes. For each case, there are both longitudinal vortex and radial vortex existing in the impeller. Considering comprehensively, impeller with radial vanes is selected in the design after simulation and comparisons...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Legal and {{political}} requirements expect all sectors in society to take river ecosystem health and biodiversity into consideration. Statkraft, international leader in hydropower and Europe’s largest generator {{of renewable energy}} has implemented an early-warning system in combination with a fish-friendly turbine management for all its run-of-river hydropower plants located along the Weser river system. The European eel (A. anguilla) stock is highly endangered and faces multiple stressors such as pollution, overfishing, lack of habitat as well ecological discontinuity through run-of-river hydropower stations and weirs, especially during migrating season (Aug-Feb). When migrating, {{there is a risk}} for silver eel getting injured by intake <b>rakes</b> and turbine <b>blades.</b> The eel-friendly turbine passage is currently considered to be the best practice in protecting migrating silver eel by reducing injuries during turbine passage and by significantly increasing the total survival rate. The eel-protective power plant management addresses one critical life phase for the endangered silver eel and is a sustainable, economic as well ecologic long term solution significantly increasing the number of eel leaving European freshwaters, which is, from a management perspective, likely to be the most effective route to improving eel stock. Experiences and results of 3 years operation mode will be presented...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research work {{is to develop a}} simulation procedure for modeling the soil-tool interaction for a blade of arbitrary shape. The primary motivation for this study is developing agricultural robots with limited power and pulling force to help farmers in crop production. In this thesis, a finite element (FE) investigation of soil-blade interaction is presented. The soil is considered as an elastic-plastic material with the non-associated Drucker-Prager constitutive law. A separation procedure to model the cutting of soil and a method of calculating the forces acting on the blade are proposed and discussed in detail. The procedure uses a separation criterion that becomes active at consecutive nodes on the predefined separation surfaces. In order to mimic soil-blade sliding and soil-soil cutting phenomena contact elements with different properties are applied. To verify correctness of the FE model developed and the procedures used, the FE results are first compared with analytical results available for straight rectangular blades from classical soil mechanics theories; and then the FE results are compared with the experimental ones. Also the effects of blade width, depth and <b>rake</b> angle on <b>blade’s</b> draft force were studied by simulating soil-blade interaction with different blade’s dimensions. After the analytical and experimental validation of the results for straight rectangular blade, the rectangular curved shape blade was modeled in order to investigate the effects of changing the blade’s radius of curvature on the blade’s draft force. The soil interaction with straight triangular <b>blade</b> in different <b>rake</b> angles was simulated next. Since the analytical solutions are limited to rectangular blades, calculated draft forces for triangular blade were verified only experimentally. The triangular and rectangular blades with the same width and depth of interaction were also investigated. The results showed that triangular blade draft force is around half of the amount of force acting on the rectangular blade with the same rake angle. Also the effect of triangular blade’s sharpness and changing the blade’s radius of curvature on draft force was discussed. By changing the blade’s sharpness, the draft forces of triangular blade were calculated in two conditions of constant blade’s width and constant blade’s contact length. The approach presented in this thesis can be used to investigate the soil-tool interactions for real and more complex blade geometries and soil conditions, and ultimately for improving design of blades to be used in tillage operations...|$|R
40|$|Particle mixing is a unit {{operation}} in many industrial {{applications such as}} pharmaceutical and chemical engineering processes. However, {{there is a lack}} of fundamental understanding of these operations due to difficulties in describing particle behaviour by governing equations. Thus, most manufacturers depend on trial-and-error efforts to design mixers that suite a certain operation. Here, a vertically-shafted cylindrical mixer is chosen as the subject of study. The method to be used for analysing particle behaviour in the mixer is the numerical simulations of particles, and is based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM). Previously, results obtained by simulations have been validated to some degree against the experimental results obtained by Positron-Emitting-Particle-Tracking (PEPT) method. Therefore, an extended version of the same software code is used here to further investigate mixing behaviour of spherical particles in the vertically-shafted cylindrical mixer. Mixing behaviour of such a mixer is generally known to be affected by many variables. The variables considered here are of three types: operational variables, design variables and properties of mixtures. The operational variables considered are blade speed and loading pattern; design variables are <b>rake</b> angle and <b>blade</b> clearance; and properties of the mixtures are volume fraction, size ratio and density ratio. In the first stage of the study, mixture quality is assessed by a conventional mixing index known as Lacey&# 146;s index to quantify effects of blade speed, <b>blade</b> clearance and <b>rake</b> angle. Such indexes are obtained by statistical analysis based on sampling methods, which suffer from uncertainties in the size and number of samples. Although, such issues are known for many decades, little has been done to address the issue. To address this issue, in the second stage of the study, a novel method is developed and used to evaluate the quality of mixtures at the particle-scale. In this method, mixture quality is defined as the variance of the particle fraction at the particle scale, and is obtained by using coordination number information, thus linking the mixture quality to the particle structure. It now depends on the particle contact condition, which is handled by specifying a maximum clearance between two particles. This particle-scale index is compared against two more methods of assessments: conventional mixing index and coordination number. In the third stage, a simple blade-particle system is considered, where a blade is dragged horizontally through a particle bed. Here, the possibility of creating dynamically similar systems is investigated. In addition, the simple system is used to model the mixing behaviour in the vertically-shafted cylindrical mixer. If proven effective, the simple system offers an easy solution for analysis of complex blade-particle systems. Both these methods are import to address scale-up issues. In the final stage, mixing of fine particles in a cylindrical mixer is considered by introducing a cohesive force on pairs of contacting particles. Cohesive force is implemented by van der Waals force, which depends on the material-dependent Hamaker constant Ha. The cohesive force is artificially varied by varying Ha to investigate effect of particle size on mixing. A higher Ha value indicates a larger cohesive force or a smaller particle diameter, and vice versa. Results show that small rake angles are suitable for mixing of cohesive particles...|$|R
