40|$|A 117. 8 L {{three-dimensional}} {{pressure vessel}} {{is used to}} study the methane hydrate dissociation with the steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) method. It is called the Pilot-Scale Hydrate Simulator (PHS). This study proposes the evaluation and the comparisons of the gas production performance by SAGD method from the methane hydrate reservoir with different steam injection rates. It indicates that the experiment could be divided into three main stages: the original gas releasing stage, the original and the hydrate-originating gas releasing stage, and the hydrate-originating gas releasing stage (the SAGD process). Furthermore, the temperature change consists of the four periods: decreasing dramatically, keeping stable, rising gradually, and keeping steady. With the injected steam flowing downwards and sideways, the steam chamber is expanding. The gas production rate increases with the steam injection <b>rate,</b> while the <b>Energy</b> <b>Efficiency</b> <b>Ratio</b> (EER) and gas-to-water ratios are improved by the decrease of the steam injection rate.

40|$|The Pilot-Scale Hydrate Simulator (PHS, 117. 8 L {{pressure}} vessel) is used {{to study}} the methane hydrate dissociation with dual horizontal wells using both the steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) and the steam assisted anti-gravity drainage (SAAD) methods. This study {{is the first time}} to propose the evaluation and the comparisons of the methane hydrate dissociation using these two methods. Both SAGD and SAAD technique are suitable for recovering gas from the unconsolidated hydrate reservoirs with high permeability. The experimental results indicate that in SAGD, the steam chamber expands and the fluid (gas and water) production process can be divided into three stages: (1) the original water and gas in the vessel are driven towards the well, and only gas is produced, (2) the gas and the original water are produced simultaneously, and (3) the steam chamber expands to the production well, and the hot water is produced. The area with limited temperature increase during the steam injection process corresponds to the hydrate undissociated zone in the reservoir. The hydrate dissociation rate, the gas production <b>rate</b> and the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> (EER) in both the cases of SAGD and SAAD decrease over time. Comparing with that in SAGD, gas is easier to be produced from the upper production well in SAAD, and the long-term EER in SAAD is also larger. In a word, as a gas-producing method, SAAD seems to be more suitable for recovering gas from the hydrate reservoir than SAGD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the office}} buildings, large energy is {{consumed}} due to poor thermal performance and low efficiencies of HVAC systems. A cooling load calculation is {{a basis for}} the design of building cooling systems. The current design methods are usually based on deterministic cooling loads, which are obtained by using design parameters. However, these parameters contain uncertainties, and they will be different from that used in the design calculation when the cooling system is put in use. The actual cooling load profile will deviate from that predicted in design. A modified bin method was used in this paper to optimize the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> (EER). A design optimization method is proposed by considering uncertainties related to the cooling load calculation. Impacts caused by the uncertainties of seven factors are considered, including the outdoor weather conditions and internal heat sources. The cooling load distribution is analyzed. Comparison between the modified bin method and CLTD/SCL/CLF method is also conducted. With the distributions of their energy consumption, decision makers can select the optimal configuration based on quantified confidence.

Most energy consumed by equipment inside the spacecraft is converted into waste heat. Current thermal control and management technology research for international aerospace has made considerable progress. Vapor compression heat pump is an important aerospace thermal control means to lunar probe program and deep space exploration. Compressors are the most important components in vapor compression heat pump systems. How to improve the performance of aerospace refrigeration compressors is a key technology. Micro-gravity environment has a great impact on system performance. For the study of the performance of compressor and heat pump system under micro-gravity environment, a test bed for the gravity independence of space-borne vapor compression heat pump system is designed and built. The test system of gravity independence mainly consists of three parts: refrigerant cycle system, water cycle system and data acquisition system. The paper tests the gravity independence of rotary compressor performance, and evaluates the performance of compressor and heat pump system in micro-gravity environment. The results show that when the control voltage of compressor speed is 2 V, the maximum tilt angle is about 60 ° under the condition of low speed operation. The inclination angle of compressor has little effect on evaporation and condensation pressure. Evaporation and condensation pressure is 4. 3 bar and 12 bar, respectively, and the pressure <b>ratio</b> is steady. <b>Energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> and coefficient of performance are about 3. 3 and 4. 2, respectively. Under the condition of the maximum tilt angle of 60 °, the system could run in the compressor speed control range of 1 - 3. 5 V. There’s a balance point when the control voltage is 1 - 2 V, and the maximum of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> and coefficient of performance are 3. 1 and 4. 0, respectively. When the voltage is 2. 5 - 3. 5 V, the compressor suction and exhaust temperature is difficult to stabilize, showing a periodical rise and fall. If the voltage is more than 3. 5 V, the compressor stops to run for self-protection. Under the condition that the compressor works in full, the maximum tilt angle is 20 °. When the tilt angle is less than 20 °, the compressor is under normal operation; when the tilt angle is more than 20 °, the compressor can not continue to maintain the operation, resulting in downtime. When the tilt angel is less than 20 °, the performance parameters do not change with the increase of the inclination angle. Evaporation and condensation pressure stabilize at 4. 2 and 13 bar, respectively. <b>Energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> and coefficient of performance are about 2. 7 and 3. 6, respectively.
