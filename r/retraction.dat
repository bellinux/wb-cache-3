5|$|In 2002, Bure {{sued the}} Russian {{newspaper}} the eXile for publishing an article stating he {{broke up with}} Kournikova because she had two vaginas. Although the newspapers' editorial staff claimed the story was a mere joke, the court ruled in favour of Bure {{in the amount of}} 500,000 rubles (US$17,770), and ordered a <b>retraction</b> to be printed. Two years later, on December 27, 2004, the Russian cosmetics chain Arbat Prestige published a story in their free promotional paper that Bure had bragged about Kournikova losing her virginity to him. Shortly thereafter, on January 31, 2005, Bure sued Arbat Prestige for 300million rubles (US$10.65million) in a court in Moscow. He also demanded the company print a <b>retraction</b> and apology in a future paper. The court ruled in favour of Bure in November 2005. However, the amount was reduced from 300million to approximately 320,000 rubles.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} <b>retractions</b> {{existing}} in all models of simply typed-calculus are studied, relating {{them to other}} relations among types as isomorphisms, surjections and injections.

50|$|<b>Retractions</b> always {{negate the}} author's {{previous}} {{public support for}} the original statement.

5|$|Plateosaurus shows {{a number}} of cursorial adaptations, {{including}} an erect hind limb posture, a relatively long lower leg, an elongated metatarsus and a digitigrade foot posture. However, in contrast to mammalian cursors, the moment arms of the limb extending muscles are short, especially in the ankle, where a distinct, moment arm-increasing tuber on the calcaneum is missing. This means that in contrast to running mammals, Plateosaurus probably did not use gaits with aerial, unsupported phases. Instead, Plateosaurus must have increased speed by using higher stride frequencies, created by rapid and powerful limb <b>retraction.</b> Reliance on limb <b>retraction</b> instead of extension is typical for non-avian dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Sex-specific {{responses}} to stress {{have also been}} demonstrated in the rat, {{to have an effect}} on the hippocampus. Chronic stress in the male rat showed dendritic <b>retraction</b> and cell loss in the CA3 region but this was not shown in the female. This was thought to be due to neuroprotective ovarian hormones.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSuppose that F:(Rn×Rd, 0) →(Rp×Rd, 0) is a {{smoothly}} stable, Rd-level preserving germ which unfolds f:(Rn, 0) →(Rp, 0); then f is smoothly stable if {{and only}} if we can find a pair of smooth <b>retractions</b> r:(Rn+d, 0) →(Rn, 0) and s:(Rp+d, 0) →(Rp, 0) such that f∘r=s∘F.

5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a contact line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or <b>retraction</b> of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight {{simulator}} {{tests were conducted}} to help to understand the trajectory of the aircraft after the engine detached and the left wing slats retracted. Those tests established that {{the damage to the}} wing's leading edge and <b>retraction</b> of the slats increased the stall speed of the left wing from 124 knots (143mph) to 159 knots (183mph). The DC-10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement warning light, which should have illuminated after the uncommanded <b>retraction</b> of the slats, and the stick shaker on the captain's control column, which activates close to the stall speed. Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine. The first officer's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.|$|E
5|$|Burrowing behaviour, {{in which}} an {{individual}} sinks itself entirely (or partially) into the substrate, is frequent among strombid gastropods. The burrowing behaviour of L.canarium consists {{of a series of}} movements characteristic of the species. There are three consecutive movements: first is probing, where the animal pushes the anterior portion of the foot into the substrate to gain a hold; next is shovelling, where it pushes the substrate with its long, extensible proboscis. <b>Retraction</b> is the final movement, where it moves the shell along an anterior-posterior axis to settle the substrate around it. Once burrowed, part of the dorsal shell is usually still visible (although the ventral surface and the animal's soft parts are buried).|$|E
5|$|In early 2008, Rosetta {{was used}} to {{computationally}} design a protein with a function never before observed in nature.

The 2008 research paper from David Baker's group describing how the protein was made, which cited Rosetta@home for the computing resources it made available, represented an important proof of concept for this protein design method. This type of protein design could have future applications in drug discovery, green chemistry, and bioremediation.|$|E
