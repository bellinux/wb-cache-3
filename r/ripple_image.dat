As the camera begins to pan right and up, it is discernable as a wall; we are outside a building (an old factory situated in Lower Manhattan). It is summer, though {{it is hard to}} tell. The camera’s movement is not smooth. It is as if it is looking for something. Eventually, it loses interest and pans left and down back to the wall.|$|R

40|$|Uniform keV ion {{irradiation}} {{causes a}} morphological instability known {{to result in}} the spontaneous formation of topographic ripple and dot patterns. The degree of order of these patterns, which {{has important implications for}} non-lithographic patterning applications, varies markedly with fabrication conditions. We investigate the influence of systematic variations of fabrication conditions, including current density, ion fluence and ion energy, on the degree of order of argon ion bombarded Si(111) surfaces. For quantifying order in sputter <b>rippled</b> topographic <b>images,</b> we develop an algorithm that evaluates the density of topological defects, such as ripple bifurcations and terminations, and suitably normalizes the result in order to present a scalar figure of merit: the normalized defect density.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel {{extension of the}} photon mapping algorithm, capable of handling both volume multiple inelastic scattering and curved light paths simultaneously. The extension {{is based on the}} Full Radiative Transfer Equation (FRTE) and Fermat’s law, and yields physically accurate, high-dynamic data than can be used for image generation or for other simulation purposes, such as driving simulators, underwater vision or lighting studies in architecture. Photons are traced into the participating medium with a varying index of refraction, and their curved trajectories followed (curved paths are the cause of certain atmospheric effects such as mirages or <b>rippling</b> desert <b>images).</b> Every time a photon is absorbed, a Russian roulette algorithm based on the quantum efficiency of the medium determines whether the inelastic scattering event takes place (causing volume fluorescence). The simulation of both underwater and atmospheric effects is shown, providing a global illumination solution without the restrictions of previous approaches.

5000|$|Thornton's first widely-recognized {{and perhaps}} still best-known {{work is the}} epic serial Peggy and Fred in Hell. The project began as she was moving into a new {{apartment}} in San Francisco and the two children who lived upstairs, Janis and Donald Reading, came to offer help. While carrying her things, they saw the film equipment {{and wanted to be}} recorded (the resulting material would eventually become part of the serial's first episode, Peggy and Fred in Hell: The Prologue). Thornton immediately fell in love with their performance and chose them as the protagonists for her then-upcoming Peggy and Fred in Hell. In a 1990 essay that acts as a descriptive companion to the serial, [...] "We Ground Things, Now, On a Moving Earth", Thornton describes the premise where a camera tracks two children [...] "raised by television" [...] who live in a [...] "post-apocalyptic splendor," [...] "adrift in the detritus of prior cultures." [...] These children, Peggy and Fred, wander through Hell (filmed primarily in California, but also across the United States) and fill their time learning [...] "how to make avocado dip, getting lost in their own house, receiving imaginary phone calls and death threats, deciding what things are for," [...] and monitoring the television sets that fill their homes. Though the Readings' performances before the camera are unscripted, Thornton provides them with [...] "a fictional construct…having been told only their names, that they are adults, that this is their house, that they are hungry.” The conditions result in improvisations that Thornton calls [...] "a true interaction in a fictionalized environment." [...] Recorded between 1981 and 1988, the footage of the children was then taken to the editing room where Thornton spliced their improvisations with archival materials, including but not limited to creation myths recorded by Franz Boas, excerpts from the Bible, outtakes from Universal newsreels, B-roll of factories from the Industrial Revolution, Thomas Edison’s archive, raw footage from the moon landing, and weather radar tapes. The resulting works were released between 1984 and 2013 in a series of 17 episodes, which range in time from two to 20 minutes each, in format from 16 mm film to analog video to digital video, and are almost entirely in black and white {{with the exception of a}} short clip in from the 1996 episode Whirling. Later episodes introduced a variety of digital effects, including text crawls, graphic overlays, and <b>rippling</b> <b>images.</b> Thornton emphasizes the serial's [...] "modular format," [...] and encourages that the episodes be played in any order or simultaneously. The themes in the serial as a whole include science fiction, ethnography, language acquisition, narrative form, the convergence of technology and the human consciousness, and the history of American cinema. She referred to the project as [...] "ongoing and open-ended" [...] until the release of The Fold in 2013.|$|R

40|$|Superlattice {{structures}} and <b>rippling</b> fringes were <b>imaged</b> on two separate pieces of graphite (HOPG) by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). We observed the corrugation conservation phenomenon {{on one of}} the superlattice structures where an overlayer does not attenuate the corrugation amplitude of the superlattice. Such a phenomenon may illustrate an implication that nanoscale defects a few layers underneath the surface may propagate through many layers without decay and form the superlattice structure on the topmost surface. Some rippling fringes with periodicities of 20 nm and 30 nm and corrugations of 0. 1 nm and 0. 15 nm were observed in the superlattice area and in nearby regions. Such fringes are believed to be due to physical buckling of the surface. The stress required to generate such structures is estimated, and a possible cause is discussed. An equation relating the attenuation factor to the number of overlayers is proposed. © 2005 The Japan Society of Applied Physics. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{an ongoing}} {{response}} to the 1992 reform of the CAP and the 1993 GATT agreement, the European Commission (EC) provided support for research on the development of new markets, products and processes for agricultural and related resources in the lagging regions of the Union. In the late 1990 s, the research reported here was funded to explore Regional Images and the Promotion of Quality Products and Services in the Lagging Regions of the European Union (RIPPLE).

40|$|CLEAN, an {{iterative}} point-deconvolution algorithm developed originally for use {{in radio}} astronomy, was investigated {{as a means of}} restoring optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of biological tissue. The CLEAN deconvolution kernel was derived from the theoretical point-spread function of an OCT scanner, which depends on the properties of the imaging system as well as the characteristics of the scattering properties of the medium. The kernel incorporates a modification based on an inverse Wiener filter that is designed to reduce <b>ripple</b> artifacts in <b>images</b> of densely packed scatterers. Evaluation of the performance of the CLEAN algorithm was carried out on a set of images acquired with a prototype scanner with built-in speckle-reduction hardware. The results show the ability of the algorithm to improve the resolution of features in coherence images of scattering phantoms and living tissue. In many cases, the restored images reveal tissue morphology not evident in the unprocessed images. CLEAN tolerates speckle noise well and its performance degrades gracefully as the number of unresolvable scatterers causing mutual interference increases. Ways of coping with the long processing time required for the restorations are outlined, along with possible improvements that would permit CLEAN to take advantage of both amplitude and phase information in partially coherent interference signals. © 1998 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers...|$|R

In section 1, we begin with a discussion of dark matter and how the wave dark matter model compares with observations related to dark matter, particularly on the galactic scale. In section 2, we show explicitly how wave dark matter shells may occur in the wave dark matter model via approximate solutions to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations. How much these wave dark matter shells (as in Figure 2) might contribute to visible shells in elliptical galaxies (as in Figure 1) is an important open question. ...|$|R

Falling in love with and marrying Los Angeles native Mary Agnes Gray, he soon moved to {{the area in the}} late 1880s and started the Kern River Company, a power company which delivered electricity from generators at the Kern River to Los Angeles. He also bought a large parcel of rich farm land, which included much of modern-day Toluca Lake and at least the western portion of the [...] "ancient and historical" [...] marshy pond now called Toluca Lake.

40|$|A new {{technique}} utilising underwater stereo-video was tested {{for its ability}} to measure nearshore bed morphology at high-frequency and high-resolution. A stereo-video system was used to monitor small-scale ripple morphology (wavelengths 0. 05 - 0. 10 m, heights ~ 5 mm) in the nearshore of a low energy beach in southwestern Australia. Waves, currents and suspended sediment concentrations were also monitored. Bed morphology could be measured with a mean accuracy of 2 mm with the stereo-video system. Measurements in the field were limited to ripple crest positions since targets over the entire ripple profiles could not be identified in both the left and right stereo images. This limitation could be overcome in the future by use of laser stripes to illuminate the profiles and the generation of epipolar lines within the analysis software to match corresponding targets in each of the <b>images.</b> <b>Ripple</b> crest positions were measured at 1 Hz and the relationship between ripple movement and near-bed hydrodynamics was investigated to test the applicability of the stereo-video system to make high-frequency bedform observations. Ripple crests were found to oscillate at the same frequency as the swell waves. The magnitude of the ripple movement at swell wave frequencies was an order of magnitude greater than ripple movement at wind wave frequencies. Net onshore migration of the ripples corresponded to onshore wave asymmetry, very weak mean cross-shore currents and net onshore suspended sediment flux measured at an elevation of 0. 05 m...|$|R
