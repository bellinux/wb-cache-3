40|$|Abstract—A sensor {{management}} {{system based on}} soft computing techniques has been developed and implemented in the flight control system of a small commercial aircraft. Unlike in the conventional sensor {{management system}}, the signals from sensors are assigned weights based on fuzzy membership functions and the consolidated signal is computed as a weighted average. This approach improves {{the quality of the}} consolidated signal and reduces transients due to sensor failures. This soft voting is extended to soft flight control law reconfiguration. In addition, a virtual sensor has been introduced as an arbitrator which enables the isolation of the failed sensor in the duplex operation and the detection of a sensor failure in the <b>simplex</b> <b>operation.</b> The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated by using an extensive simulation model of a small commercial aircraft, developed by airframe and control system manufacturers on the basis of an existing business jet. Furthermore, the system has been successfully evaluated and compared to standard techniques by means of pilot-in-the-loop simulations on the Research Flight Simulator of the National Aerospace Laboratory in The Netherlands. This application, developed within a Brite/EuRam research project, is characterized by the effective combination of novel soft computing techniques with standard, well proven methods of the aircraft industry. The properties of the conventional sensor management system have been retained, with the additional advantage that the quality of the consolidated signal is improved, the failure-induced transients are reduced, and the consolidated signal remains available up to the last valid sensor.

40|$|Unlike the {{traditionally}} fixed recipes in batch process operation, flexible recipes allow the adjustment {{of some of}} its relevant recipe items. These adjustments can either be predefined in cases of planned experimentation, or suggested by a formal process optimization or control algorithm on the basis of actual information. In both the response surface methodology and the <b>simplex</b> evolutionary <b>operation</b> (EVOP), some well-known methods for empirical model building and process optimization, flexible recipes are involved. Another application of flexible recipes arises in a feedforward quality control strategy of batch processes when variations in market or process conditions are known a priori. The experimental results of these strategies are presented for the batchwise production of benzylalcohol on a pilotplant scale. Experiments have been performed to obtain a reliable model of the yield. On the basis of this model, better process conditions have been suggested, which substantially deviate from the final simplex resulted from experiments within simplex EVOP.

40|$|Most {{optimization}} algorithms use empirically-chosen fixed parameters {{as a part}} {{of their}} search strategy. This paper proposes to replace these fixed parameters by adaptive ones to make the search more responsive to changes in the problem by incorporating fuzzy logic in optimization algorithms. The proposed ideas are used to develop a new adaptive form of the simplex search algorithm whose objective is to minimize a function of n variables. The new algorithm is labeled Fuzzy Simplex. The search starts by generating a simplex with n + 1 vertices. The algorithm then repeatedly replaces the point with the highest function value by a new point. This process has three components: reflecting the point with the highest function value, expanding, and contracting the <b>simplex.</b> These <b>operations</b> use fuzzy logic controllers whose inputs incorporate the relative weights of the function values at the simplex points. Standard minimization test problems are used to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm. The Fuzzy Simplex algorithm generally results in a faster convergence. Robustness and sensitivity of the algorithm are also considered. The Fuzzy Simplex algorithm is also applied successfully to several engineering design problems. The results of the Fuzzy Simplex algorithm compare favorably with other available minimization algorithms...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade the New Zealand dairy {{industry}} has greatly increased its spray drying capacity {{in response to the}} world market demand for spray dried milk products. Powder specifications are becoming increasingly complex and smaller quantities of each product are required as the number of different products grows. These factors have made it necessary {{to learn more about the}} way processing variables influence the product quality in order to improve product quality control. A computer simulation model providing a complete description of the drier behaviour was developed from a series of experiments on a pilot scale spray drier. This took the form of regression equations relating the quality parameters of skim milk powder to the drier operating variables and the composition and physical properties of the skim milk. The model was then used in the development of a quality control system and also to simulate and evaluate a variety of commercial operating practices. The characteristics of the spray drying process were investigated using the pilot plant evaporator and spray drier at the New Zealand Dairy Research Institute, which had been fully instrumented and interfaced to a process control computer. The drier studies confirmed the importance of low concentrate viscosity in the production of good quality milk powder. This could be achieved by keeping concentrate holding times to a minimum and by using high temperature, short time preheat treatments. The protein content of the skim milk was found to be the major determinant in the seasonal changes observed in concentrate viscosity, high protein contents giving high viscosities. The study of the hydrodynamics of centrifugal pressure nozzle atomisers revealed that the nozzles used in milk powder drying fall into two distinct categories, each with characteristic behaviour in response to variations in fluid viscosity. The magnitude of the viscosity effect depends on the ratio of the swirl chamber and orifice diameters. The large capacity nozzles used in tall-form driers exhibit a marked decrease in pressure drop at constant flowrate as the viscosity of the concentrate fed to them is increased. This was found to play a very important part in determining the overall behaviour of the drier. Five operating variables; the inlet air temperature and the concentrate total solids, feedrate, atomising pressure and temperature, proved to be necessary and sufficient to describe the drier performance and to predict the properties of the powder. Simulation studies of two outlet air temperature control strategies clearly demonstrated the superiority of inlet air temperature manipulation over that of concentrate feedrate, for driers employing large capacity nozzles. The drier model was used in the selection, tuning and evaluation of a quality control system based on the <b>SIMPLEX</b> Evolutionary <b>Operation</b> scheme of Spendley et al. The process of spray drying milk powders presents several control problems. There are a number of quality parameters assessed by laboratory analysis, which means that feedback is multivariable, delayed and subject to error. Furthermore, the processing characteristics of milk change with time. A single measure of the powder quality was obtained from penalty functions based on economic considerations. After selection of the SIMPLEX step sizes with the help of simulation model, a pilot plant trial of the scheme was conducted. The <b>Simplex</b> evolutionary <b>operation</b> method was found to be a simple robust procedure which rapidly improved the product quality and maintained it in the face of disturbances typical of those likely to occur in commercial operation. The method provides two sets of plant conditions in advance, a feature which permits a substantial increase in the speed of attainment of optimum conditions for processes with setpoint response times similar to the time required to analyse the product quality. The Simplex method is therefore particularly suited to the manufacture of spray dried milk powders...|$|R

It presents four tools to help with process improvement projects.

40|$|The {{need to move}} data {{securely}} {{from one}} domain to another, while protecting the security levels of both environments, {{is central to the}} operation of sharing information between government entities. Whether distributing information from centralized, highly secure IT centers or bringing in information from unsecured sources, IT managers require absolute assurance that the cross border communication path is free from security compromise. A formal means to provide information sharing while protecting your domain is through the deployment of a one-way information transfer or “data diode”. This paper describes the use of physical one-way data transfer systems to secure cross border information sharing systems. This paper first describes the need and usefulness of a true physical one-way, data diode information transfer for security. Unfortunately, traditional data diodes are unreliable, low bandwidth implementations that in many cases openly expose their one-way functionality to the point of requiring additional safeguards. We show how these limitations can be overcome with the use of solid engineering design methods. This includes the use of link level protocols designed to transfer information reliably in <b>simplex</b> or asynchronous <b>operation.</b> The paper provides a taxonomy of one-way designs and goes on to explain how hardware can complement operating system drivers and application proxy software to create a reliable, scalable, physical one-way “protocol break ” between standard IP communication networks...|$|R
5000|$|One {{approach}} to cross-department netting is {{the capability of}} some modern trunked systems to provide a function called dynamic regrouping; a feature that Motorola doesn't support in <b>simplex</b> (e.g. 'fireground') <b>operations.</b> It is therefore necessary for a disaster to be near enough the infrastructure to allow for repeater access/operation. Many agencies with Motorola trunked systems already have this capability but it's hardly ever used; even in a crisis. The difficulty of operating such a system is often too great for poorly educated dispatchers who often have no college - much less any particular training in computers or communications systems - other than the 'cursory' training they receive in a 3 or 5 day class the vendors offer. The feature allows the dispatch center personnel to send units from different agencies who are responding to the same incident to a common talk group or virtual channel. This assumes the agencies all share a capability to operate over the same trunked radio system, which is rare. In an informal survey of three agencies with trunked systems that included this feature, users at two sites reported they did not think their system included the feature. A representative from a third site said he [...] "...thought they had the feature but never used it." [...] Of the three agencies with the feature, {{no one knew how}} to use it. This would suggest, (in at least the three agencies contacted,) that dynamic regrouping was not valuable. Like other disaster readiness processes, users would have to practice using the feature in order for it to be useful during an incident.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{industrialization}} and the breakthrough of modern industrial processes {{comes as a}} result of implementation and utilization of information technology, advances in programming and software engineering, and all available tools that support the optimization and automation of all processes. Applied computer programs for calculation of technological indicators in mineral technology, economic and technical efficiency – show modest results in the process of optimization of all processes. The need for optimization comes from the aspect of business and economic trends, management, industrial and other processes. The need for continuous improvement is a key aspect in management; whether {{there is a need for}} increase in production of raw materials, or increasing profits when investing in particular endeavor. Since there is only one answer to the problem, we need to choose the “best” solution (or more possible solutions to the problem). So, first the purpose of the problem has to be determined: is it economic or technical. Economic purposes can include: maximizing profit, minimizing costs etc. Technical purposes can include the following: higher annual production, minimal losses during the operation of a certain machine, greater productivity etc. It’s understandable that in industrial optimization prevails the economic form of the goal. If the goal isn’t previously determined, an improvement cannot be executed, because there is no basis for comparison of multiple solutions. The problem must be defined so that all its information can be in a quantitative form, and that is the function of the goal, which is used to select decisions in the system’s changeables. Information on most cycles in the real environment, as well as in mineral technology, such as technological, ie the size of parameters in models from processing units in the cycle - require information on input or output parameters in the closed cycle. The size of the remaining parameters are calculated or derived from other measured characteristics. The full calculation of the data actually is far more complex and requires full study of the techniques that can be applied, including their advantages or disadvantages, which would be a subject of further study or elaboration. Systems engineering can be defined as a conception, planning, designing and engineering of influential elements of each system which still exists in the moment of processing. System analyzes represent a scientific method for bringing decisions which are based on quantitative and other objective evaluations of all alternatives that exist in systems and which are upgraded during their processing. Operational research is defined as an application of mathematical models in the problem of optimization of the goal of every system that is previously defined. These three disciplines are very similar in their aims, but only operational research by nature and form are more mathematical, hence an important and often obligatory part of the other two disciplines. For this purpose, an attempt is made in this doctoral dissertation to program simple or complex cycles of a real environment, in order to avoid arduous calculations and to solve problems, defined by the given tasks. The optimal solution does not always represent the best solution; equipment and facilities have been changing, the components are changed periodically, and many other factors make small changes that affect the variable solution. One of the most popular EVOP methods is sequence simplex optimization. Simplex EVOP was proposed as the alternative to the original Box EVOP – evolutionary <b>operation.</b> <b>Simplex</b> requires less experimentation and achieves the optimum in the process much faster. Instead of factorial experiments, Simplex EVOP uses threading of experimental designs in the form of a regular Simplex. Programs for simple closed grinding-classification cycles - MINTEH - 3, MINTEH - 2 and MINTEH - 1 are created in Visual Studio 2008 and provide quick and efficient resolution of problems, where the operator enters the appropriate program input or modifies it, programs show results on application windows, with real choices of input data that will contribute to the optimal and improved results. MULTISIMPLEX ® is used to display optimal operation of process from the real environment, using various tools, simulators and graphic-display spreadsheet for optimization. The effectiveness from the implementation of this program provides fast and efficient optimization of existing industrial processes through a modern approach. This technique can be used for automatic optimization of almost all processes where control variables and measurable goals exist. Microsoft Excel 2010 provides an opportunity for a genuine and real display of technological and industrial processes in a real environment or economic and comparative analyzes in the same kind of environment, through descriptive statistic and other features.
