40|$|Accurate, {{cost-efficient}} {{monitoring instrumentation}} {{has long been}} considered essential to the operation of power plants. Nonetheless, for the monitoring of coal flow, such instrumentation has been sorely lacking and technically difficult to achieve. With {{more than half of}} the electrical power in the United States currently supplied by coal, energy generated by this resource is critical to the US economy. The demand for improvement in this area has only increased as a result of the following two situations: First, deregulation has produced a heightened demand for both reduced electrical cost and improved grid connectivity. Second, environmental concerns have simultaneously resulted in a need for both increased efficiency and reduced carbon and NOx emissions. A potential approach to addressing both these needs would be improvement in the area of combustion control. This would result in a better heat rate, reduced unburned carbon in ash, and reduced NOx emissions. However, before feedback control can be implemented, the ability to monitor coal flow to the burners in real-time must be established. While there are several ''commercially available'' products for real-time coal flow measurement, power plant personnel are highly skeptical about the accuracy and longevity of these systems in their current state of development. In fact, following several demonstration projects of in-situ coal flow measurement systems in full scale utility boilers, it became obvious that there were still many unknown influences on these instruments during field applications. Due to the operational environment of the power plant, it has been difficult if not impossible to sort out what parameters could be influencing the various probe technologies. Additionally, it has been recognized for some time that little is known regarding the performance of coal flow splitters, even where <b>rifflers</b> are employed. Often the coal flow distribution from these splitters remains mal-distributed. There have been mixed results in the field using variable orifices in coal pipes. Development of other coal flow control devices has been limited. An underlying difficulty that, to date, has hindered the development of an accurate instrument for coal flow measurements is the fact that coal flow is characterized by irregular temporal and spatial variation. However, despite the inherent complexity of the dynamic system, the system is in fact deterministic. Therefore, in principle, the coal flow can be deduced from the dynamics it exhibits. Nonetheless, the interactions are highly nonlinear, rendering standard signal processing approaches, which rely on techniques such as frequency decomposition, to be of little value. Foster-Miller, Inc. has developed a methodology that relates the complex variation in such systems to the information of interest. This technology will be described in detail in Section 2. A second concern regarding the current measurement systems is installation, which can be labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive. A process that does not require the pulverizer to be taken off line would be highly desirable. Most microwave and electrostatic methods require drilling up to 20 holes in the pipe, all with a high degree of precision so as to produce a proper alignment of the probes. At least one electrostatic method requires a special spool piece to be fitted into each existing coal pipe. Overall, these procedures are both difficult and very expensive. An alternative approach is pursued here, namely the development of an instrument that relies on an acoustic signal captured by way of a commercial accelerometer. The installation of this type of sensor is both simpler and less invasive than other techniques. An accelerometer installed in a pipe wall need not penetrate through the wall, which means that the system may be able to remain on line during the installation. Further, due to the fact that the Dynamical Instruments technology, unlike other systems, does not rely on uniformity of the air or coal profile, the installation location need not be on a long, straight run of pipe. In fact, an optimal signal is obtained near a pipe elbow. This is fortuitous, as bends are often more accessible on pipes in a power plant than straight sections. In contrast to measurement systems that rely on the uniformity of the air and coal profile, the accuracy of the system under development will not compromised by varying levels of flow uniformity...|$|R

50|$|The Zillertal <b>Riffler</b> (Zillertaler <b>Riffler)</b> is only {{enclosed}} by glaciers {{to the north}} and west. To the north the Federbettkees starts just below the summit whilst, to the west, is the much smaller Schwarzbrunnerkees. To the southeast are the remnants of the Rifflerkees, which has largely retreated due to global warming. Amongst the neighbouring peaks are the twin summits of the Gefrorene-Wand-Spitzen (3,288 m) along the southwest ridge (Südwestgrat) {{on the other side of}} the 2,904 m high wind gap of the Friesenbergscharte. On the other side of the Federbettkees, along the north ridge (Nordgrat) which swings northeast, lie the Griererkarspitze (2,968 m), Napfspitze (2,925 m) and die 3,038 metre high Realspitze, separated by the col of Obere Rifflerscharte (2,968 m), Along the southeast ridge (Südostgrat), above the Wesendlekarsees glacier (surface at 2,375 m) and separated by the 2,774 m high col of Untere Rifflerscharte, is the Kleine <b>Riffler</b> (2,835 m).

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{undertaken}} using a lubricated iron alloy powder to analyse rolling segregation using a novel bench size segregation tester. Bulk particulates charcaterised by small particle sizes, narrow size distributions, free-flowing natures, high particle densities and high inter-particle forces of attraction; necessitate {{the use of}} a very careful experimental procedure to obtain repeatable results. A 16 cup spinning <b>riffler</b> has been used to obtain representative samples and dry sieving has been used to obtain particle size distributions. The effect of height of discharge on surface effect segregation within the heap has also been analysed for an iron alloy powder. Close tolerances in powder quality are necessary for efficient production, and control of these tolerances can only be achieved by detailed analysis of materials and processes. The quantification and identification of segregation effects has been a challenge, especially in the field of powder metallurgy. This study attempts to quantify segregation and is considered as a first step towards the prediction of segregation behaviour for general powders...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates binder {{distribution}} in wet granulation {{and focuses on}} the nucleation zone, which is {{the area where the}} liquid binder and powder surface come into contact and form the initial nuclei. An equipment independent parameter, dimensionless spray flux Psi (a), is defined to characterise the most important process parameters in the nucleation process: solution flowrate, powder flux, and binder drop size. Ex-granulator experiments are used to study the relationship between dimensionless spray flux, process variables and the coverage of binder fluid on the powder surface. Lactose monohydrate powder on a variable speed <b>riffler</b> passed under a flat spray once only. Water and 7 % HPC solution at two spray pressures were used as binders. Experiments with red dye and image analysis demonstrate that changes in dimensionless spray flux correlate with a measurable difference in powder surface coverage. Nucleation experiments show that spray flux controls {{the size and shape of}} the nuclei size distribution. At low Psi (a), the system operates in the drop controlled regime, where one drop forms one nucleus and the nuclei size distribution is narrow. At higher Psi (a), the powder surface cakes creating a broader size distribution. For controlled nucleation with the narrowest possible size distribution, it is recommended that the dimensionless spray flux be less than 0. 1 to be in the drop-controlled regime.

40|$|Online process {{analytics}} {{has been}} a topic of interest by pharmaceutical companies {{as a method of}} determining how operating parameters affect the final quality of their products. One form of online process analytics that {{has been found to be}} effective is microwave sensing. While it has been found that microwave resonance sensing can be used to measure parameters such as moisture content and density, it has yet to be discovered if such sensors have the ability to measure changes in content uniformity of raw materials pharmaceutical companies use. Data was collected using a spin <b>riffler</b> fitted with a microwave sensor and a near infrared probe (NIR) (more commonly used method of monitoring) that is to be tested against. Various known compositions mixtures of acetaminophen (APAP) and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) powders were created and tested for content uniformity and moisture content by passing it over the sensor. The raw data was passed through MATLAB’s neural networks software and a calibration model was created for content uniformity that can be used to predict values. Upon analyzing the data, it was found that an accurate reading of composition uniformity could be determined using a microwave sensor. The model created aided in determining the composition of unknown blends of powder and proved to be accurate. This calibration model will serve as a contribution to the ongoing research being performed in online process analytics. By utilizing these techniques, pharmaceutical companies have the ability to more efficiently analyze their products in an online real-time process...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. At {{the very}} roots of this {{dissertation}} lies a commercial process with many as yet unexplored characteristics {{that will be}} thoroughly examined, using a rich variety of statistical methods and techniques. Broadly speaking, the main objective of this study involves the development of techniques to control the quality of advanced explosives detonators used in commercial mining operations. To accomplish this task, various statistical characteristics of this detonation process are described and examined {{in order to obtain}} a holistic understanding of the underlying process. The parameters of the process are introduced and estimates for unknowns are derived. Real-time quality control techniques based on these results are suggested. 1. 2. The role of blasting in mining A major part of South Africa's economy is based on the mining of the rich mineral deposits that {{are to be found in}} the country. These mining operations are carried out both above ground (open-pit iron ore mines, for example) and below ground (gold, uranium and others). Open-pit mining, in particular, requires significant amounts of commercial blasting to dislodge the high volumes of material that have to be moved and processed. An average blasting block at Iscor's Sishen mine, for example, contains about 250 000 tons of material, although a world record was established in April 1981 when 7, 2 million tons of rock was broken during a single blast. The chemical quality of the final products is partly controlled by supplying the primary crusher at the mine with a suitable mixture of so-called run-of-mine ore. To determine which material from a specific blasting block may be sent to the plant, and to which waste dump the remaining material should be assigned, factors such as beneficiation properties of the raw material and the content of various by-products are considered. Samples are typically taken from alternate blast holes for every metre drilled. Each drill sample is divided into two parts by means of a <b>riffler</b> for a washed and unwashed sample. The washed samples are examined and the rock types noted. Subsequently, all the samples are grouped and analysed chemically and the densities of the different rock types are determined. The results are processed and those for the washed and unwashed samples correlated. The blasting blocks in the pit are demarcated by means of whitewash lines, according to the divisions on the blasting-block plans, and they are marked with signs to guide shovel operators. Primary drilling is performed by means of electrically-driven rotary drills. At the Sishen mine, 310 mm diameter blast holes are drilled in all rock types. The following table depicts typical drilling 2 patterns for various rock types: Rock type Pattern (m) Drill depth (m) Hard iron ore 2 x 8, 3 3, 0 Medium-hard iron ore 1 x 9, 3 2, 7 Quartzite 8, 2 x 9, 4 2, 5 Flagstone 8, 2 x 9, 4 5 Calcrete 8, 1 x 9, 3 0 Primary blasting is done at Sishen with Heavy Anfo, an explosive that is manufactured by mine personnel at the emulsion plant on site. The ingredients for the explosive blends are transported by pump trucks to the blasting blocks, where it is mixed and pumped down the blast holes. Good fragmentation of the blasted material is a prerequisite for high loading rates by the loading equipment. At Sishen and other similar mines, a blasting efficiency of 3, 2 tons of rock per kilogram of explosives used, is considered to be acceptable...|$|E
40|$|Silo or Bin is used very {{widely in}} Mining, Processing, Pharmaceutical, Cement, Ceramics and Packaging industries. The {{purpose of the}} silo is to hold {{material}} until it is ready to use in subsequent processes such as processing, chemical, physical or transport. According to the Oxford Dictionary (DK illustrated), a Silo is a pit or airtight structure in which green crops are kept for fodder {{or it can be}} a pit or a tower for the storage of grains,cement etc, or it is an underground storage chamber for guided missiles. The capacity of a silo may vary from Kgs. to Tons. In this research, a silo is used as a conical shaped container with an orifice through which mineral sands of varying sizes were allowed to pass and their flow behavior were examined with respect to their material physical properties and silo parameters. In the first stage of the project, the flow behavior was studied using beach mineral sands with glass funnels with orifice diameters 3. 5, 4. 8 and 8. 0 mm and heights 8, 10 and 24 cm respectively to simulate silos of varying orifice. The capillary part of the funnels were cut uniformly at the neck regions to prepare them for the tests. It was decided to use naturally occurring geo-materials of different mineralogical, chemical, and physical characteristics for the investigation. For this purpose, samples of beach sand from several locations along the western coast of Sri Lanka were collected and sampled using the sampler <b>riffler,</b> thereafter sieved through 2 mm sieve to remove sea shells and other extraneous impurities followed by spiral separation and tabling. Subsequently, magnetic separation and high tension separation were carried out to separate magnetic and non magnetic fractions according to the standard procedure. The fractions separated consisted of ilmenite, rutile, garnet and zircon. A sample of silica was also obtained from the glass sand deposit at Naththandiya. Each sand sample was sifted using the standard test sieves. Before conducting the flow properties of these minerals they were dried at 110 °C for 2 hours and the test was conducted 3 times and the average flow rate obtained thus was plotted against the particle size and the diD ratio for each material. Where, d = average particle size diameter and, D = funnel orifice diameter. Interpretation of flow rate measurements and analysis of data indicate that all beach mineral sands used in the study had the same flow rate pattern. The mass flow rate vs diD curves consisted of three significant zones representing bridging effect, constant gradient zone with a negative gradient and the no-flow zone, which spilled over to the fine particle fractions. The effects of charge particle nature, moisture contained, repose angle, surface morphology of mineral and the orifice diameter of the funnel on the flow properties were also investigated. As the particles studied were naturally occurring, they were sub-angular having rounded edges. Another series of experiments were conducted using spherically shaped silica gel particles having diameters 1. 2, 2. 2, and 3. 3 mm respectively. In the second stage, a pilot plant {{in the form of a}} conical silo was fabricated in the workshop and the experiments were conducted using mineral samples each sample weighed approximately 3 to 6 kg. The samples for the second stage was obtained from two sources, Lanka Mineral Sands Ltd and the river sand pits at lngiriya. After a tedious process of size separation mostly involving sorting of particles of different size fractions by hand picking and sieving. The results obtained agree very closely with those obtained using the glass funnels. It is evident that there are three zones in the performance curve -flow rate vs particle size with the bridging effect region corresponding to diD ratios of 1 / 4 to 115 for relatively larger size particles and the region exhibiting the 'floc effect' resulting from residual charges in the fine sizes and air trapped within the floes. The mineral particles used were pre-dried (dried at 110 °C for two hours). However, the presence of moisture in the powder seems to have a significant contribution on the flow rate. - The importance of the performance curve and its characteristic features have been discussed and also the relevance of the performance curve in designing silos...|$|E
