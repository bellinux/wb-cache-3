Similarly, most classroom teachers include this relationship between reading and meaning in their definitions of reading (Green, Macaui, & Wood 1978). Little research. however, has been done on children’s perceptions of reading (Tovey 1976). How do children view reading?

From his Goldeneye home on Jamaica's northern shore, Fleming had visited Port Royal on {{the south of the}} island, which was once the home port of Sir Henry Morgan, all of which stimulated Fleming's interest. For the background to Mr Big's treasure island, Fleming appropriated the details of Cabritta Island in Port Maria Bay, which was the true location of Morgan's hoard.|$|E
5|$|Gaddafi {{was ready}} now for an {{offensive}}. The decisive offensive began in June, when a 3,000-strong GUNT force invested Faya-Largeau, the main government stronghold in the North, which fell on 25 June. The GUNT force rapidly proceeded towards Koro Toro, Oum Chalouba and Abéché, assuming {{control of the}} main routes towards N'Djamena. Libya, while helping with recruiting, training, and providing the GUNT with heavy artillery, only committed a few thousand regular troops to the offensive, {{and most of these}} were artillery and logistic units. This may have been due to Gaddafi's desire that the conflict be <b>read</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Chadian internal affair.|$|E

He continually revised the manuscript, and it remained in an unfinished state on his death.

The document itself, destined to be <b>read</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> proclamation, was most likely drafted by Heliade Rădulescu, and Bălcescu himself was possibly {{responsible for most of}} its ideas. It called for, among other issues, national independence, civil rights and equality, universal taxation, a larger Assembly, responsible government, a five-year term of office for Princes and their election by the Assembly, freedom of the press, and decentralization.|$|E

He took exception to several of the arguments in The Times: young women of the 1860s, he wrote, were not unaware of the existence of prostitution; and attempting to keep them in ignorance would not conduce to virtue. Rather than promoting vice, an accurate depiction of the squalid and miserable life of a woman of the streets would arm young people to resist temptation.|$|E

5|$|Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine (Wadzek's Struggle {{with the}} Steam Turbine) is a 1918 comic novel by the German author Alfred Döblin. Set in Berlin, it narrates the futile and often {{delusional}} {{struggle of the}} eponymous industrialist Wadzek against Rommel, his more powerful competitor. In its narrative technique and its refusal to psychologize its characters, {{as well as in}} its vivid evocations of Berlin as a modern metropolis, Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine has been <b>read</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> precursor to Döblin's better-known 1929 novel Berlin Alexanderplatz.|$|E
5|$|Creangă {{eventually}} {{moved out}} of the monastery, but refused to relinquish his key to the church basement, and, in what was probably a modernizing intent, chopped off his long hair, one of the traditional marks of an Orthodox priest. The latter gesture scandalized his superiors, particularly since Creangă explained himself using an ancient provision of canon law, which stipulated that priests were not supposed to grow their hair long. After some assessment, his superiors agreed not to regard this action as more than a minor disobedience. He was temporarily suspended in practice but, citing an ambiguity in the decision (which could be <b>read</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> banishment in perpetuity), Creangă considered himself defrocked. He relinquished his clerical clothing altogether and began wearing lay clothes everywhere, a matter which caused public outrage.|$|E
5|$|Eddie Izzard as {{the voice}} of Reepicheep, a swashbuckling mouse. Over 100 actors auditioned to voice the character. Izzard {{approached}} Reepicheep as less camp and more of a bloodthirsty assassin with a sense of honour (a cross between Mad Max and a Stormtrooper from Star Wars): Izzard interpreted Reepicheep as someone whose family was killed by the Telmarines. The Narnia series were some of the few books Izzard <b>read</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> child, and he cherished them. When discussing Reepicheep to the animators, Adamson told them to rent as many Errol Flynn films as possible. Adamson credits Izzard for making the role his own; beforehand, the director was approaching the character similarly to Puss in Boots in Shrek 2.|$|E

He is also <b>read</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ironist in the postmodern vein, an ironist whose writing shatters reader and author alike. The essay thus runs two processes simultaneously: Firstly it is a quasi-theoretical attempt at establishing Kundera’s idea of being. Secondly it will be an attempt at showing how Kundera’s ironising function is manifested in the novels themselves...|$|R

5|$|Writer Vince Gilligan was {{inspired}} to write the episode based on Time-Life mail order books he <b>read</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> child discussing the lives of serial killers. One of the books featured mass murderer Howard Unruh. The episode was also inspired by Ted Serios, whose thought-photographs were mentioned by Fox Mulder in the episode. The use of the dentist chair where Schnauz sat his victims was included considering people's common fear of the dentist. Gilligan had written the role of Schnauz with Taylor Vince {{in mind when he}} saw him in the Adrian Lyne film Jacob's Ladder. Vince had been approached to be a guest star on the show in the first season but declined the role due to it being too small.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century the move away from figurative {{painting}} to impressionism and abstraction, continued the decline of portrait painting. The first significant group of Scottish artists to emerge in {{the twentieth century}} were the four members of the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s. They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post-impressionism reached Scotland. Of their number Francis Cadell (1883–1937), emerged as a significant painter of still lives and single figure compositions, particularly with interior backdrops, before moving closer to abstraction. Of the next significant movement, known as The Edinburgh School, Cecile Walton (1891–1956) referenced classical forms, particularly in her ironic self-portrait Romance (1920), which draws on Titian's Venus of Urbino and Manet's Olympia. Her close friend Dorothy Johnstone's portraits, such as the young girl in September Sunlight (1916), made use of interior natural light. The work of James Cowie (1886–1956), who painted a number of girls in interior settings, is similar in theme to that of Johnstone, but had a more distant and elegiac feel that can be seen in Falling Leaves (1934), which has been <b>read</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> commentary as a commentary on the transition from childhood to adolescence.|$|E
5|$|Latin American {{novels that}} explore {{political}} themes, but {{that do not}} centre upon the rule of a particular dictator, are informally classified as “not quite dictator novels”. For example, Libro de Manuel (A Manual for Manuel, 1973), by Julio Cortázar, is a postmodern novel about urban guerrillas and their revolutionary struggle, which asks the reader to examine the broader societal matters of language, sexuality, and the modes of interpretation. In the Time of the Butterflies (1994), by Julia Álvarez, {{tells the story of}} the Mirabal sisters, whom patriotism transformed from well-behaved Catholic débutantes to political dissenters against the thirty-year dictatorship of the Trujillo régime in the Dominican Republic. The novel sought to illuminate the officially-obscured-history of the deaths of the Mirabal sisters, not to determine what happened to them, but to determine how the Mirabal sisters happened to the national politics of the Dominican Republic. In the mock-diary “Intimate Diary of Solitude” (third part of El imperio de los sueños 1988; Empire of Dreams, 1994), by Giannina Braschi, the protagonist is Mariquita Samper, the diarist who shoots the narrator of the Latin American Boom in revolt against his dictatorial control of the fictional narration. Moreover, in Braschi’s most recent work “United States of Banana” (2011), the Puerto Rican prisoner Segismundo overthrows his father, the King of the United States of Banana, who had imprisoned him for more than a hundred years in the dungeon of the Statue of Liberty, for the crime of having been born. The story of Distant Star (1996), by Roberto Bolaño, begins on 11 September 1973, with the coup d’état by General Augusto Pinochet against Salvador Allende, the President of Chile. The writer and professor of literature Raymond Leslie Williams describes the aforementioned novels as not-quite-dictator-novels, which are reminiscent of the genre for being “acutely and subtly political fiction” that addresses themes different from those of the dictator novel, which cannot be divorced from the politics of the stories, and so each “can be <b>read</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> meditation on the horror of absolute power”.|$|E
