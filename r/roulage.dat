50|$|Napoleon {{presented}} the last battle of revolutionary terror against the bourgeois society {{which had been}} proclaimed by this same Revolution, and against its policy. Napoleon, of course, already discerned {{the essence of the}} modern state; he understood that {{it is based on the}} unhampered development of bourgeois society, on the free movement of private interest, etc. He decided to recognise and protect this basis. He was no terrorist with his head in the clouds. Yet at the same time he still regarded the state as an end in itself and civil life only as a treasurer and his subordinate which must have no will of its own. He perfected the terror by substituting permanent war for permanent revolution added. He fed the egoism of the French nation to complete satiety but demanded also the sacrifice of bourgeois business, enjoyments, wealth, etc., whenever this was required by the political aim of conquest. If he despotically suppressed the liberalism of bourgeois society — the political idealism of its daily practice — he showed no more consideration for its essential material interests, trade and industry, whenever they conflicted with his political interests. His scorn of industrial hommes d'affaires was the complement to his scorn of ideologists. In his home policy, too, he combated bourgeois society as the opponent of the state which in his own person he still held to be an absolute aim in itself. Thus he declared in the State Council that he would not suffer the owner of extensive estates to cultivate them or not as he pleased. Thus, too, he conceived the plan of subordinating trade to the state by appropriation of <b>roulage</b> haulage. French businessmen took steps to anticipate the event that first shook Napoleon's power. Paris exchange-brokers forced him by means of an artificially created famine to delay the opening of the Russian campaign by nearly two months and thus to launch it too late in the year.|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 1) Objectives : During {{a typical}} day a person's time is mostly divided between their home, workplace and either public or private transport. The dose received over the timescale of a day {{is the sum of}} doses received in these different micro-environments, which supposes knowledge of the time spent in each of them as well as the quality and variability of pollutant concentrations. The aim of the project presented here is to study the levels and dynamics of pollutants entering a particularly important micro-environment, that of the passenger compartment. This is done by considering: - nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, particle number and size; - monitoring exposure during various trips (highway, beltways); - taking into account factors that influence exposure, such as the distance between the source vehicle and the target vehicle. 2) Method : A vehicle was equipped with two NOx analysers (TEI), a CO analyser (Maihak), a granulometer (ELPI J DEKATI) and particle counter (P-Track / TSI). The measurements focused on the air expelled at the outlet of the passenger compartment ventilator. Trips were made in different environments such as a highway and the Paris beltway, as well as in a tunnel at night behind a known type of vehicle for a known distance. 3) Results and conclusions : Orders of magnitude of concentration were determined for the pollutants considered for different exposure conditions (open and closed environments, and light and heavy traffic). During tunnel driving tests, a clear link was established between exposure characteristics on the one hand and, on the other, factors such as the nature of the vehicle followed, its engine rating and the distance separating the target and the source. Au cours de sa journée, un citadin répartit essentiellement son temps entre son domicile, son lieu de travail et les transports individuels ou collectifs. La dose reçue à l'échelle d'une journée, est la somme des doses reçues dans ces différents micro-environnements. Le projet présenté ici a pour objectif l'étude des niveaux et de la dynamique de polluants entrant dans un micro-environnement particulièrement important, l'habitacle automobile. Pour ce faire, un véhicule a été équipé de deux analyseurs de NOx (TEI), d'un analyseur de CO (Maihak), d'un granulomètre (ELPI /DEKATI) et d'un compteur de particules (P-Track / TSI). Les mesures ont porté sur l'air fourni en sortie de l'aérateur de l'habitacle. Des " <b>roulages</b> " ont été effectués, dans différents milieux tels qu'une autoroute, ou le périphérique parisien, ainsi qu'au niveau d'un tunnel donné, de nuit, à la suite d'un véhicule de nature connue pour une distance connue...|$|R
