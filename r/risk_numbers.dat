40|$|An {{important}} question in clonal forestry concerns {{the number of}} clones needed in plantations to protect against catastrophic failure {{while at the same}} time achieving the uniform stands, high yields, and ease of management associated with this management system. This paper looks at how the required number of clones needed to achieve a predetermined maximum acceptable level of risk changes as underlying system parameters- level of loss acceptable to the plantation manager; number or severity of pest attacks; level of clonal resistance to attack; and gene frequencies associated with ‘susceptible ’ alleles- increase or decrease. In general, the number of clones needed decreases as the intensity of pest attack increases, and increases if any of the other quantities increases. An explanation of these trends is offered in terms of risk-prone vs. risk-averse behavior, and implications for governmental regulations and forest management are discussed.

It is well known that a child's IQ {{is one of the}} best predictors for later school achievement. Levels of individual intelligence achievements are affected decisively by biological and psychosocial risks. It is as yet not sufficiently documented, whether variance in risk factors affects IQ level and stability of intelligence achievements. This study analyses the effect total number and variability of psychosocial risk factors exert on level and stability of intelligence from a developmental psychology perspective. Furthermore it examines the effects of risk factors and IQ on completion of school and social developmental tasks in first class. The sample consisted of N= 120 children (66 girls, 54 boys) aged M= 6. 1 years (SD=. 41), who were tested twice for IQ and risks over a period of one year. Results show a significant inverse effect of <b>risk</b> <b>number</b> on children's intelligence achievements. In sum, stability of IQ was demonstrated.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{statistical}} tools {{have been developed}} over the years for assessing the risk of reentering object to human populations.

This information, combined with information on the expected ground path of the reentry, is used to compute the probability that {{one or more of the}} surviving debris might hit a person on the ground and cause one or more casualties. The statistical portion of this analysis relies on a number of assumptions about how the debris footprint and the human population are distributed in latitude and longitude, and how to use that information to arrive at realistic <b>risk</b> <b>numbers.</b> This inevitably involves assumptions that simplify the problem and make it tractable, but it is often difficult to test the accuracy and applicability of these assumptions.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the role of}} time and affect in intentions to purchase a risk-protective measure (Studies 1 and 2) and explored participant abilities to factor time into the likelihood judgments that presumably underlie such intentions (Study 3). Participants worried more about losing their possessions {{and were more likely}} to purchase a protective measure given a longer term lease than a short-term lease, but only if their belongings were described in affect-poor terms. If described instead as being particularly special and affect-rich, participants neglected time and were about equally likely to purchase a risk-protective measure for shorter and longer term leases. However, and consistent with prior literature, the cognitive mechanism underlying this time-neglect-with-affect-richness effect seemed to be the greater use of the affect heuristic in the shorter term than the longer term. Study 2 results demonstrated that prior experience with having been burglarized amplified the interactive effect of time and affect. Greater deliberation did not attenuate this effect as hypothesized whether deliberation was measured through numeracy or manipulated through instructions. The results of Study 3 indicated that few participants are able to calculate correctly the <b>risk</b> <b>numbers</b> necessary to take time into account.

40|$|Butterfly valves {{are mostly}} used in various {{industries}} such as oil and gas plant. This valve operates with rotating motion using pneumatic system. Rotating actuator turns the disc either parallel or perpendicular to the flow. When the valve is fully open, the disc is rotated a quarter turn so that it allows free passage of the fluid and when fully closed, the disc rotated a quarter turns to block the fluid. The primary failure modes for valves are the valve leaks to environment through flanges, seals on the valve body, valve stem packing not properly protected, over tightened packing nuts, the valve cracks and leaks over the seat. To identify the failure of valve Failure Mode and Effects Analysis has been chosen. FMEA is the one of technique to perform failure analysis.

40|$|Failure {{mode and}} effects {{analysis}} {{is an important}} methodology, which has been extensively {{used to evaluate the}} potential failures, errors, or risks in a system, design, or process. The traditional method utilizes the <b>risk</b> priority <b>number</b> ranking system. This method determines the <b>risk</b> priority <b>number</b> by multiplying failure factor values.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease {{prevention}} {{is guided by}} so-called risk tables for calculating individual's <b>risk</b> <b>numbers.</b> However, they are not widely used in routine practice {{and it is important}} to understand the conditions for their use. OBJECTIVES: Systematic review of the literature on professionals' performance regarding cardiovascular risk tables, in order to develop effective implementation strategies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported quantitative empirical data on the effect of professional, financial, organizational or regulatory strategies on the implementation of cardiovascular risk tables. Participants were physicians or nurses. OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary: professionals' self-reported performance related to actual use of cardiovascular risk tables. Secondary: patients' cardiovascular risk reduction. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: An extensive strategy was used to search MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PSYCHINFO from database inception to February 2007. MAIN RESULTS: The review included 9 studies, covering 3 types of implementation strategies (or combinations). Reported effects were moderate, sometimes conflicting and contradictory. Although no clear relation was observed between a particular type of strategy and success or failure of the implementation, promising strategies for patient selection and risk assessment seem to be teamwork, nurse led-clinics and integrated IT support. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation strategies for cardiovascular risk tables have been sparsely studied. Future research on implementation of cardiovascular risk tables needs better embedding in the systematic and problem-based approaches developed in implementation science...|$|E

When compared with the target numbers of road deaths for 2010, the prognoses show that these target numbers appear achievable. This is on condition that the effectiveness of the road safety policy does, during the coming years, result in a greater annual decrease in fatal risk than was achieved during 1991 - 1998.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} expert treatment {{selection for}} early rheumatoid arthritis and to validate a prediction model for rapid radiographic progression (RRP) in daily practice. METHODS: Patients received initial combination therapy with steroids (ICTS) or disease-modifying antirheumatic drug monotherapy (IMT) after informal evaluation of prognostic factors, {{followed by a}} tight control strategy. Changes in Sharp/van der Heijde score (total Sharp score (TSS)) of > 5 units over 1 year (=RRP) were documented. The mean change in TSS and proportion with RRP were compared between groups. Based on the 28 swollen joint count, rheumatoid factor titre and C reactive protein/erythrocyte sedimentation rate, patients {{were placed in the}} ASPIRE prediction matrix, yielding a RRP <b>risk.</b> <b>Numbers</b> needed to treat (NNT) intensively to avoid one RRP after 1 year were calculated. RESULTS: The mean change in TSS after 1 year and the proportion with RRP was lower in the ICTS group (n= 37) than in the IMT group (n= 43). The mean calculated risk of RRP was higher in patients with radiographic progression. The mean NNT intensively to prevent RRP was lower in the ICTS group than in the IMT group. The positive predictive value of NNT for RRP prevention was 12. 6 %, but the negative predictive value reached 100 %. CONCLUSION: ICTS seems more effective in preventing RRP than IMT.
