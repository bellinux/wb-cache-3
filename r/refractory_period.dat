5|$|Purkinje cells {{form the}} heart of the {{cerebellar}} circuit, and their large size and distinctive activity patterns have made it relatively easy to study their response patterns in behaving animals using extracellular recording techniques. Purkinje cells normally emit action potentials at a high rate {{even in the absence of}} the synaptic input. In awake, behaving animals, mean rates averaging around 40Hz are typical. The spike trains show a mixture of what are called simple and complex spikes. A simple spike is a single action potential followed by a <b>refractory</b> <b>period</b> of about 10ms; a complex spike is a stereotyped sequence of action potentials with very short inter-spike intervals and declining amplitudes. Physiological studies have shown that complex spikes (which occur at baseline rates around 1Hz and never at rates much higher than 10Hz) are reliably associated with climbing fiber activation, while simple spikes are produced by a combination of baseline activity and parallel fiber input. Complex spikes are often followed by a pause of several hundred milliseconds during which simple spike activity is suppressed.|$|E
25|$|Masters and Johnson {{described}} the two-stage detumescence of the penis: In the first stage, the penis decreases from its erect state to about 50 percent larger than its flaccid state. This occurs during the <b>refractory</b> <b>period.</b> In {{the second stage}} (and after the <b>refractory</b> <b>period</b> is finished), the penis decreases in size and returns to being flaccid. It is generally impossible for men to achieve orgasm during the <b>refractory</b> <b>period.</b> Masters and Johnson argue that this period must end before men can become aroused again.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{reason for the}} lack or absence of a <b>refractory</b> <b>period</b> in men may be an increased infusion of the hormone oxytocin. It is believed that the amount by which oxytocin is increased may affect the length of each <b>refractory</b> <b>period.</b> A scientific study to successfully document natural, fully ejaculatory, multiple orgasms in an adult man was conducted at Rutgers University in 1995. During the study, six fully ejaculatory orgasms were experienced in 36 minutes, with no apparent <b>refractory</b> <b>period.</b> Later, P. Haake et al. observed a single male individual producing multiple orgasms without elevated prolactin response.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} effects of {{testosterone}} and its metabolites on the electrical activity of single corticomedial amygdala neurones in the male rat. Experiments concentrate, in particular, on those corticomedial amygdala neurones which project directly to the medial preoptic/anterior hypothalamic junction. An attempt to relate the observed neuronal effects of testosterone to sexual behaviour has also been made. The first Chapter reviews the electrophysiological experiments on {{the effects of}} sex steroids on single neurones in the central and peripheral nervous system. The second Chapter describes experiments which show that long term castration lengthens the absolute <b>refractory</b> <b>periods</b> of corticomedial amygdala neurones which project to the medial preoptlc/anterlor hypothalamic junction. Adjacent corticomedial amygdala neurones which project to the capsule of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus did not show this effect. Chapter 3 describes an experiment which shows that long term testosterone treatment reduces the absolute <b>refractory</b> <b>periods</b> of corticomedial amygdala neurones which project to the medial preoptlc/anterlor hypothalamic junction, In castrated rats. Results show a direct effect of testosterone In the central nervous system. Chapter k Investigates the effects of two major metabolites of testosterone, oestradlol and dihydrotestosterone, on the absolute <b>refractory</b> <b>periods</b> of these corticomedial amygdala neurones. Oestradlol, but not dihydrotestosterone produces the same reduction effect as testosterone. Results provide direct evidence that oestradlol has the same effect as testosterone In the central nervous system. Chapter 5 describes two similar experiments which show that the testosterone reduction of the absolute <b>refractory</b> <b>periods</b> of these corticomedial amygdala neurones Is correlated with the time at which the hormone stimulates full sexual behaviour. Chapter 6 discusses the significance of the testosterone effect on corticomedial amygdala neurone absolute <b>refractory</b> <b>periods...</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{source of}} {{nonlinearity}} in the fMRI response {{is from the}} <b>refractory</b> <b>period,</b> where brain activity from a presented stimulus suppresses further activity on a subsequent, similar, stimulus. As stimuli become shorter, the <b>refractory</b> <b>period</b> becomes more noticeable. The <b>refractory</b> <b>period</b> does not change with age, nor do the amplitudes of HDRs. The period differs across brain regions. In both the primary motor cortex and the visual cortex, the HDR amplitude scales linearly with duration of a stimulus or response. In the corresponding secondary regions, the supplementary motor cortex, which is involved in planning motor behavior, and the motion-sensitive V5 region, a strong <b>refractory</b> <b>period</b> is seen and the HDR amplitude stays steady {{across a range of}} stimulus or response durations. The refractory effect {{can be used in a}} way similar to habituation to see what features of a stimulus a person discriminates as new.|$|E
25|$|The {{resolution}} phase occurs after orgasm {{and allows}} the muscles to relax, blood pressure to drop and the body to slow down from its excited state.

40|$|SUMMARY We {{studied the}} {{difference}} between myocardial vulnerability to arrhythmias caused by cathodal, anodal, and bipolar stimulation in 29 dogs with partial right coronary artery ocdusion. We used 2 -msec duration stimuli of up to 8 mA to determine the ventricular vulnerable periods, {{their relationship to the}} <b>refractory</b> <b>periods,</b> and the fibrillation or multiple response thresholds for unipolar anodal and cathodal stimulation after two premature ventricular contractions. The vulnerable period for arrhythmias began {{at the end of the}} respective <b>refractory</b> <b>periods</b> and terminated at a specific time within the cardiac cycle. Within this period the arrhythmia and excitation thresholds were equal. Because shorter <b>refractory</b> <b>periods</b> were obtained with anodal stimulation than cathodal, the vulnerable periods for anodal stimulation were longer. This indicated that the vulnerable periods for bipolar stimulation also would be longer than for unipolar cathodal stimulation since bipolar and anodal <b>refractory</b> <b>periods</b> are equal when the cathode and anode are of similar surface area. Results from seven of the experiments showed that a dual focus of excitation, which can only occur with bipolar stimulation, did not make the ventricle more vulnerable to arrhythmias than did unifocal stimulation. These results indicate that {{the difference between}} the arrhythmia vulnerability to unipolar cathodal, anodal, and bipolar stimulation is dependent on the relationship between their excitability characteristics, i. e., their strength-interval curves.

25|$|During the {{resolution}} phase, muscles relax, blood pressure drops, {{and the body}} returns to its resting state. Though generally reported that women do not experience a <b>refractory</b> <b>period</b> and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms soon after the first, some sources state that {{both men and women}} experience a <b>refractory</b> <b>period</b> because women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement. This period may last from minutes to days and is typically longer for men than women.|$|E
25|$|In a {{heart with}} AF, the {{increased}} calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum and increased calcium sensitivity {{can lead to}} accumulation of intra-cellular calcium and causes down regulation of L-type calcium channels. This reduces the duration of action potential and <b>refractory</b> <b>period,</b> thus favourable for the conduction of re-entrant waves. Increased expression of inward-rectifier potassium ion channels can cause a reduced atrial <b>refractory</b> <b>period</b> and wavelength. The abnormal distribution of gap junction proteins such as GJA1 (also known as Connexin 43), and GJA5 (Connexin 40) causes non-uniformity of electrical conduction, thus causing arrhythmia.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} {{to think of the}} advancing wave of depolarisation as a dipole with a head and a tail. The length of the <b>refractory</b> <b>period</b> and the time taken for the dipole to travel a certain distanceâ€”the propagation velocityâ€”will determine whether such a circumstance will arise for re-entry to occur. Factors that promote re-entry would include a slow-propagation velocity, a short <b>refractory</b> <b>period</b> with a sufficient size of ring of conduction tissue. These would enable a dipole to reach an area that had been refractory and is now able to be depolarised with continuation of the wavefront.|$|E
40|$|Atenolol, a {{cardioselective}} beta-blocking agent, at {{dose levels}} of 0. 03, 0. 06, and 0. 12 mg/kg intravenously, produced prolongation of atrioventricular nodal conduction in 22 patients with suspected coronary artery disease. In {{a dose of}} 0. 12 mg/kg body weight atenolol produced significant prolongation of sinus cycle length, sinus node recovery time, atrioventricular node conduction, and the effective and functional <b>refractory</b> <b>periods</b> of the atrium and the atrioventricular node. No significant effects were observed on the His Purkinje system or the effective <b>refractory</b> <b>periods</b> of the ventricle. In these actions atenolol closely resembles propranolol.

25|$|According to Masters and Johnson, {{women have}} the ability to orgasm again very quickly, {{as long as they have}} {{effective}} stimulation. As a result, they are able to have multiple orgasms in a relatively short period of time. Though generally reported that women do not experience a <b>refractory</b> <b>period</b> and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms, soon after the first, some sources state that men and women experience a <b>refractory</b> <b>period</b> because women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement. For some women, the clitoris is very sensitive after climax, making additional stimulation initially painful. After the initial orgasm, subsequent orgasms for women may also be stronger or more pleasurable as the stimulation accumulates.|$|E
25|$|The {{course of}} the action {{potential}} {{can be divided into}} five parts: the rising phase, the peak phase, the falling phase, the undershoot phase, and the <b>refractory</b> <b>period.</b> During the rising phase the membrane potential depolarizes (becomes more positive). The point at which depolarization stops is called the peak phase. At this stage, the membrane potential reaches a maximum. Subsequent to this, there is a falling phase. During this stage the membrane potential becomes more negative, returning towards resting potential. The undershoot, or afterhyperpolarization, phase is the period during which the membrane potential temporarily becomes more negatively charged than when at rest (hyperpolarized). Finally, the time during which a subsequent action potential is impossible or difficult to fire is called the <b>refractory</b> <b>period,</b> which may overlap with the other phases.|$|E
25|$|The {{absolute}} <b>refractory</b> <b>period</b> {{is largely}} responsible for the unidirectional propagation of action potentials along axons.

Spike count variability was {{lower than that of}} a Poisson process at all three stages but increased at each stage. Absolute and relative <b>refractory</b> <b>periods</b> largely accounted for the reliability at all three stages.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the site used for atrial pacing on atrial and {{atrioventricular}} nodal conduction were assesed in 16 patients. In 13 patients, three atrial pacing sites were used: high right atrium, low lateral right atrium, and midcoronary sinus. Two recording sites were used: low septal right atrium, including His electrogram, and high right atrium. Stimulus (S) to high right atrium interval was longest with coronary sinus pacing (76 plus or minus 7 ms) (P less than 0. 001), and shortes with high right atrial pacing (41 plus or minus 3 ms) (P less than 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract. The space-lumped two {{variable}} neuron {{model is}} studied. The {{extension of the}} neural model by adding a simple synaptic current allows to demonstrate neural interactions. The production of synchronous burst activity in this simple two neuron excitatory loop is modeled, including the influence of random background excitatory input. The ability of the neuron model to spatially and temporally integrate inputs is shown. Two <b>refractory</b> <b>periods</b> after stimuli were identified and their role in burst cessation is shown. Our findings show that simple neural units without long-lasting membrane processes are capable of generating long lasting patterns of activity. The results of simulation of simple background activity suggest that an increase in background activity tends to cause decreased activity of the network. This phenomenon as well as existence of two <b>refractory</b> <b>periods</b> allows for burst cessation without inhibition in this simple model. ...|$|R
