Chen Tai ordered Yong’s Inspector, Wang Jing, to garrison Didao and wait there for reinforcements. However, Wang Jing wanted to win glory for himself, so he marched {{out of the city}} and met Jiang Wei in battle at Gu Pass. Jiang Wei defeated Wang Jing, who fled back to Didao with only 10,000 men.He then focused on defending the city as he had been ordered to and held Jiang Wei off. On hearing this news Chen Tai moved to aid Wang Jing as fast as he could. He feared that Jiang Wei would seize a major supply depot at Liyang, to the east, and thus have the necessary provisions for his army. He further feared that Jiang Wei would recruit from the surrendered and defeated soldiers as well as rally the Qiang and amass a considerable force. This would have made him a serious threat. However, Jiang Wei advanced and besieged Didao instead. Deng Ai, Wang Bi, and Hu Fen moved to join Chen Tai's force while Jiang Wei was aware that Wei reinforcements would come, so he stationed soldiers in ambush to attack them upon arrival, but because of the route he took, moving through the mountains and arriving at a mountain southeast of Didao, Chen Tai avoided these troops entirely. Jiang Wei attacked Chen Tai’s forces on the mountain, but because the terrain was to Chen Tai’s advantage, Jiang Wei’s army was easily driven off.

The thesis {{is focused on the}} Office building with vertical load-bearing structure made as a frame structure, consisting of columns and beams, which are interconnect with the solid reinforced concrete slabs. Load-bearing construction has been designed under the old Yugoslav regulations. For the analysis of vertical load-bearing elements has been made an idealized 3 D mathematical model with program ETABS, and an independent idealized 2 D mathematical model for the analysis of horizontal structure with programe SAP 2000. Both programs are based on finite element method. In the analysis different effects were taken into consideration, such as permanent impacts, impacts of imposed loads, snow and wind loads and also seismic.

40|$|Graduation thesis {{consists}} of three parts. The first part is theoretical. General facts about shallow and deep foundations are presented {{with an emphasis on}} shallow foundations. Pocket foundations are explained in detail. The calculation of stresses below footing slab under different types of loads is given. In the second part the procedure for design of pocket foundation is explained. Two examples of design of pocket foundations are presented: pocket foundation with flat inner surface of footing wall and pocket foundation with ribbed inner surface of footing wall. The first step in designing pocket foundations is to determine the stresses under footing slab. Stresses depend on the size of footing slab, type of loading and type of ground soil The calculated stresses must be within allowable stresses in grounds. Stresses define the dimensions of footing slab or actions needed to implement the soil. Next step is to determine the bending and shear reinforcement in footing slab. The type of inner surface on footing wall has a great influence on the amount of reinforcement. Example shows that the needed shear reinforcement in a pocket foundation with flat inner wall surface is bigger than in foundation with ribbed surface. Next step is to determine the horizontal and vertical reinforcement in footing wall. As an example a <b>reinforcement</b> <b>drawing</b> of pocket footing is presented. The drawing was made in a computer program for drawing reinforcement drawings Armcad 2000. In the last part a computer program for designing pocket footings is explained. The program was written in a computer software C Sharp and Microsoft Visual Studio 2008. The program designs the pocket foundation and calculates needed reinforcement...|$|E
40|$|Steel, mild or high strength, {{has been}} the {{traditional}} material for the reinforcement of concrete in Ghana. The high cost of steel {{and the need to}} use reinforced concrete in areas of low applied loads have necessitated the look at using materials other than steel for <b>reinforcement.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on that, this study investigates the use of plastic in the form of ebonite strips as reinforcement in concrete beams. Tests were conducted to determine the tensile and bonding strength of ebonite strip and the flexural strength of ebonite strip-reinforced concrete beams, {{on the assumption that the}} flexural strength of the beam is derived primarily from the concrete/ebonite strip bonding action. The tests revealed that the failure strengths of ebonite strip-reinforced beam is much lower than that of comparable steel-reinforced concrete beam; the reason being the low bond between ebonite strips and concrete. It is therefore inferred that ebonite strips cannot be used as a complete substitute for steel reinforcement. However, the flexural failure loads obtained revealed that for lightly loaded concrete elements such as lintels over small openings of up to 1000 mm, ebonite strip can be used in place of steel reinforcement. The tests also revealed that the top threshold of ebonite strip input was about 5 % of the cross-sectional area of the lintel beam. It was observed that ebonite strip would be beneficial for use in flexural members if they could be anchored to the concrete by a suitable mechanical means at their ends, in a manner similar to anchor blocks in steel pre-stressed tendons and, additionally, have their surfaces roughened or ribbed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the designing {{of the administrative}} building of CGP according to the current Eurocode standards {{in the field of}} constructions. Reinforced concrete construction consists of two parts which are separated with dilatation. The focus is {{on the part of the}} building that was built in 2007 and consists of the basement, the ground floor, two floors and the attic. The load-bearing construction of this five-storey building consists of monolith reinforced concrete plates and walls of reinforced concrete which are connected with beams. The analysis of vertical load-bearing elements was made with the use of the ETABS program, while the analysis of ceiling plates was performed with the SAFE program. In the analysis, permanent impacts, impacts of imposed loads, snow and wind loads, but also seismic effects were taken into consideration. Presented in detail is the designing of characteristic ceiling construction, the most loaded cantilever wall, and the wall and the beam from the system of connected walls. The presented vertical load-bearing elements are designed by the method of capacity design. The purpose of analysing an already built structure is to compare the quantity of reinforcement required by Eurocode standards with the actual reinforcement, established in accordance with the requirements of the Yugoslav regulations (JUS). The comparison indicated that a more accurate model used in this thesis has a greater effect on the quantity of reinforcement in ceiling construction than the difference in regulations. Nevertheless, the Eurocode standard requires longer boundary elements and significantly less reinforcement in the web of the wall. In beams that connect the walls, there are small differences between the quantities of built-in reinforcement and the reinforcement required by the Eurocode standard. Shear reinforcement is sufficient, only the distance between the bars is too big. The amounts and locations of reinforcement in analysed elements are shown in the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>drawing.</b> ...|$|E
