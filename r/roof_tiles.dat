5|$|In {{the first}} stratum, a {{courtyard}} surrounded by several rooms, {{which is part}} of a large courtyard building, was discovered. The remains of the structure included the foundations and fragments of <b>roof</b> <b>tiles,</b> which most likely, covered the rooms and were found on the surface. The source of the <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> is the port of Marseilles, France, and most were stamped with the heart-shaped emblem of the Roux Frères roof-tile factory. The <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> indicate that the building was erected {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century CE. Several other <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> were stamped with a swan symbol, these were probably imported in a later phase of the building’s existence, at the beginning of the twentieth century, for the purpose of repair. According to Micah Linn of Mishmar HaEmek, the building was no longer standing at the time when the kibbuz was founded and therefore, it is estimated to have been in use for only several decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtyard}} {{house is}} {{the most common type of}} home portrayed in Han artwork. Ceramic architectural models of buildings, like houses and towers, were found in Han tombs, perhaps to provide lodging for the dead in the afterlife. These provide valuable clues about lost wooden architecture. The artistic designs found on ceramic <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> of tower models are in some cases exact matches to Han <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> found at archaeological sites.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship of}} certain red ceramic <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> properties to <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> biodeterioration. The following properties were studied: apparent porosity, roughness, and {{the presence or absence}} of two types of coatings. The effect of apparent porosity was studied by varying the peak firing temperature of a standard industrial red ceramic <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> composition and by preparing several clay mixtures, of different chemical and mineralogical composition, that were fired at various peak temperatures. The effect of <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> roughness was determined by either polishing or sanding fired standard red <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles.</b> A waterproof ceramic glaze coating and a photocatalytic coating were formulated to analyse the effect of the presence of different types of coatings. <b>Roofing</b> <b>tile</b> bioreceptivity was evaluated with a method developed in a previous study using the cyanobacteria Oscillatoria sp, which enabled <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> resistance to microbial colonization to be determined. As expected, bioreceptivity rose as apparent porosity (measured as water absorption) increased, enabling possible water retention, which favours biological growth. Similarly, greater roughness encouraged micro-organism adhesion and 2 raised bioreceptivity. It was found that, after prolonged exposure periods (several months) under very favourable conditions for biological colonization, <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> coated with the waterproof ceramic glaze were colonized. However, glazed standard red <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> covered with a TiO 2 photocatalytic coating exhibited practically no biological growth under the test conditions used, even after long exposure times, owing to the chemical-physical effect of the TiO 2 -based coating...|$|R

40|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{estimating}} the wind resisting property of a new type <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> which has peculiar overlaping corners, loading tests of <b>roofing</b> <b>tiles</b> were made assuming that the wind force acting on a <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> is perpendicular to the roofing surface. The test results showed {{that this kind of}} <b>roofing</b> <b>tile</b> is able to withstand strong gusts having velocities up to 60 m/s if all tiles are nailed on battens tightly. However, it was also found that the advantage gained by using this tile is almost lost if the tiles are nailed on battens at intervals of several rows following the conventional roofing method. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Traditional {{industry}} remaining as much traditional is justifiable, if {{the industry}} is maintaining its finest outputs and consistent qualities with a sizable market share. Such industry may not be coming under criticisms for technology stagnations. The traditional industry of <b>roof</b> <b>tile</b> manufacturing {{is a kind of}} technologically stagnant industry, but not coming under the above mentioned acceptable type of traditional industry, especially because of the low productivity. As a measure of rescuing the traditional <b>roof</b> <b>tile</b> industry, the “step by step technological transformation” of the industry would be the exact need. This seems phenomenally justifiable with the <b>roof</b> <b>tile</b> traditional manufacturers’ desire to have a technologically enhanced and affordable replacement for the traditional drying process. As a critically important step, development of a feasible <b>roof</b> <b>tile</b> drier solution to enhance productivity in traditional <b>roof</b> <b>tile</b> industry was performed. The structural design of drier module and its setup, as well as the air flow, heat-source and heat-input quantity, and RH management were carried out. Mathematical model based drying and energy analysis also carried out, in parallel with the experimentations. As the final result, the complete dryer solution was derived with necessary parametric figures for realization...|$|R

5|$|The 17th-century room, S2, {{used the}} south {{wall of the}} {{existing}} structure as its own north wall, and was largely built using materials salvaged from S1, although the standard of the work was poorer. The new room had a double fireplace, {{but there was no}} evidence of a dividing wall between the two hearths. Limestone blocks, identical to the quoins in S1, were used as structural and decorative features in the fireplace. In addition to the pantiles taken from S1, there were Cornish slate <b>roof</b> <b>tiles.</b> Whether they formed part of the roof of S2 or were associated with the possible wooden extension is unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{new owners}} of Santa María de Óvila were well-to-do farmers who cared little for the {{buildings}}. For a brief time, the former monastery {{was used as}} a hostel, but mainly, the buildings were subjected to hard agricultural use as barns sheltering livestock. The chapter house served as a manure pit. Other buildings were used as storage. In the early 20th century small trees were seen to be growing in the dirt packed atop the monastery roofs—the protective <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> had long since been taken down and sold.|$|E
5|$|The straight, {{symmetrical}} stone columns {{found in}} the Polonnaruwa Vatadage are quite similar to those seen in buildings of the Anuradhapura period.

This is widely accepted, and nails and <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> found in excavations seem to support this. However, another theory is that the Vatadage did not have a roof, and the stone columns were used to hang lamps, curtains or Buddhist symbols.|$|E

5|$|Timber was {{the chief}} {{building}} material during the Han dynasty; {{it was used to}} build palace halls, multi-story residential towers and halls and single-story houses. Because wood decays rapidly, the only remaining evidence of Han wooden architecture is a collection of scattered ceramic <b>roof</b> <b>tiles.</b> The oldest surviving wooden halls in China date to the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). Architectural historian Robert L. Thorp points out the scarcity of Han-era archaeological remains, and claims that often unreliable Han-era literary and artistic sources are used by historians for clues about lost Han architecture.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{relatively}} strong ground motions, {{damage to}} the area was very limited; structures around the epicenter were a mix of fairly vulnerable and resistant to earthquake shaking. Buildings swayed with the tremor in Mexico City, causing panic among many citizens and prompting some to evacuate. Several schools in Guerrero were evacuated as a safety precaution. The earthquake and its aftershock sequence contributed to intermittent power outages in Acapulco; more than 40,000 residences in some 40 districts remained without power by the next day. There were no reports of major losses or fatalities {{in the wake of}} the tremor, though two police stations located in Acapulco and Marquelia suffered light damage. Elsewhere, some fallen <b>roof</b> <b>tiles</b> and small landslides occurred east of the epicenter in Cuautepec.|$|E
