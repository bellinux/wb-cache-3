5|$|In June 1970, Vikrant was docked at the Naval Dockyard, Bombay, due to many {{internal}} fatigue {{cracks and}} fissures {{in the water}} drums of her boilers {{that could not be}} repaired by welding. As replacement drums were not available locally, four new ones were ordered from Britain, and Naval Headquarters issued orders not to use the boilers until further notice. On 26 February 1971 the ship was moved from Ballard Pier Extension to the anchorage, without replacement drums. The main objective behind this move was to light up the boilers at reduced pressure, and work up the main and flight deck machinery that had been idle for almost seven months. On 1 March, the boilers were ignited, and basin trials up to 40 <b>revolutions</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPM)</b> were conducted. Catapult trials were conducted on the same day.|$|E

Our initial approach considered the present operating methods (both fixed and variable displacement stations) of each system's arrangements and the potential rearrangement concept towards improving daily serviceability and energy efficiency. Earlier research suggested that some test procedures could be duty cycled on demand load rather than continuous full load cycle. Other test procedures suggested additional adjustment of fixed pressure setting while still controlling the same volume flow from a multi-test station system.

2500|$|The power a Formula One engine {{produces}} {{is generated}} by operating {{at a very high}} rotational speed, up to 15,000 <b>revolutions</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>rpm).</b> This contrasts with road car engines of a similar size which typically operate at less than 6,000 rpm. The basic configuration of a naturally aspirated Formula One engine had not been greatly modified since the 1967 Cosworth DFV and the mean effective pressure had stayed at around 14 bar MEP. Until the mid-1980s Formula One engines were limited to around 12,000 rpm due to the traditional metal valve springs used to close the valves. The speed required to operate the engine valves at a higher rpm called for ever stiffer springs, which increased the power loss to drive the camshaft and the valves {{to the point where the}} loss nearly offset the power gain through the increase in rpm. [...] They were replaced by pneumatic valve springs introduced by Renault, which inherently have a rising rate (progressive rate) that allowed them to have extremely high spring rate at larger valve strokes without much increasing the driving power requirements at smaller strokes, thus lowering the overall power loss. [...] Since the 1990s, all Formula One engine manufacturers used pneumatic valve springs with the pressurised air allowing engines to reach speeds of over 20,000rpm.|$|E

As {{the new generation of}} helicopters includes variable engine <b>revolutions</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>RPMs)</b> during flight, it becomes relevant to add active control to their suspension systems. Most active system performance derives directly from the controller construction, its optimization to the system controlled, and the disturbances expected.

In this paper, we demonstrate the efficiency of a new hybrid active suspension by combining the advantages of two different approaches in vibration control: resonant absorbers and active suspensions.

Step-drawdown tests known so far are performed strictly keeping the value of the pumping rates constant through all the steps of the test.

Our approach, in this peculiar case, has made possible to understand how actually the discharge Q varies in function of the drawdown s_w. It has also made possible to monitor the approaching of the equilibrium between Q and s_w, using both the variation of Q and that of s_w with time.

This study explored the effect of various parameters in drilling operations and how they affect the flow rate required for effective cutting transport. Three models, developed following an empirical approach, were employed: Rudi-Shindu 2 ̆ 7 s model, Hopkins 2 ̆ 7, and Tobenna 2 ̆ 7 s model. Rudi-Shindu 2 ̆ 7 s model needs iteration in the calculation. Firstly, the three models were compared using a sensitivity analysis of drilling parameters affecting cutting transport.

Petrol fuelled vehicles are fitted with natural gas vehicle (NGV) conversion kit to enable bi-fuel operation between CNG and petrol. This experimental approach {{is focused on the}} fuel consumption, exhaust emission and fuel cost between natural gas and petrol operations. The specially constructed test rig comprises of the bi-fuel fuel system employed in the 1500 cc 12 valves carburettor engine NGV taxis. The inherent fuel consumption and corresponding exhaust emission are acquired at different engine <b>revolution</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (<b>rpm)</b> during petrol and CNG operation separately. The engine rpm operating without load is varied from idle to more than 5000 rpm to acquire the fuel consumption and exhaust emission profile. These two acquired data are then used to calculate the engine’s air fuel ratio. All three parameters acquired are used to conduct comparisons between petrol and natural gas operation. It is seen that the bi-fuel system operates with air fuel ratio ranging from 19 to 16. 3 for petrol operation and ranges from 40 to 18. 7 for natural gas operations. The emission during CNG operation clearly shows significant decrease in hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) over the use of petrol. In terms of cost, the use of CNG provides savings exceeding 50 % through all engine rpm compared to petrol non-loaded operations...|$|R
