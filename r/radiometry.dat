25|$|In 1979, {{because of}} the {{difficulties}} in realizing a Planck radiator at high temperatures and the new possibilities offered by <b>radiometry,</b> the 16thCGPM adopted the modern definition of the candela. The arbitrary (1/683) term was chosen so that the new definition would exactly match the old definition. Although the candela is now {{defined in terms of}} the second (an SI base unit) and the watt (a derived SI unit), the candela remains a base unit of the SI system, by definition.|$|E
25|$|In optical <b>radiometry,</b> {{sheets of}} PTFE {{are used as}} {{measuring}} heads in spectroradiometers and broadband radiometers (e.g., illuminance meters and UV radiometers) due to PTFE's capability to diffuse a transmitting light nearly perfectly. Moreover, optical properties of PTFE stay constant {{over a wide range}} of wavelengths, from UV down to near infrared. In this region, the relation of its regular transmittance to diffuse transmittance is negligibly small, so light transmitted through a diffuser (PTFE sheet) radiates like Lambert's cosine law. Thus PTFE enables cosinusoidal angular response for a detector measuring the power of optical radiation at a surface, e.g. in solar irradiance measurements.|$|E

2500|$|Light is {{measured}} with two main alternative sets of units: <b>radiometry</b> consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths, while photometry measures light with wavelength weighted {{with respect to}} a standardised model of human brightness perception.

2500|$|The PPR {{had seven}} <b>radiometry</b> bands. One of these used no filters and {{observed}} all incoming radiation, both solar and thermal. Another band allowed only solar radiation through. The {{difference between the}} solar-plus-thermal and the solar-only channels gave the total thermal radiation emitted. The PPR also measured in five broadband channels that spanned the spectral range from 17 to 110 micrometres. The radiometer provided data on the temperatures of Jupiter's atmosphere and satellites. The design of the instrument was based on that of an instrument flown on the Pioneer Venus spacecraft. A [...] aperture reflecting telescope collected light and directed it {{to a series of}} filters, and, from there, measurements were performed by the detectors of the PPR. The PPR weighed [...] and consumed about 5 watts of power.|$|E
