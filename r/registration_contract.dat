40|$|A {{range of}} {{alternative}} empirical definitions of informal activity have been {{employed in the}} literature. Choice of definition is often dictated by data availability. Different definitions may imply very different conceptual understandings of informality. In this paper the authors investigate the degree of congruence between three definitions of informality based on employment <b>contract</b> <b>registration,</b> social security protection, and {{the characteristics of the}} employer and employment using Brazilian household survey data for the period 1992 to 2001. The authors present evidence showing that 64 percent of the economically active population are informal according to at least one definition, but only 40 percent are informal according to all three. Steady compositional changes have been taking place among informal workers, conditional on definition. The econometric analysis reveals that the conditional impact of particular factors (demographic, educational attainment, and family circumstances) on the likelihood of informality varies considerably from one definition to another. The results suggest growing heterogeneity within the informal sector. Therefore, the authors argue that informal activity may be as much associated with entrepreneurial dynamism as with any desire to avoid costly <b>contract</b> <b>registration</b> and social protection. However, the authors confirm there is no a priori reason for entrepreneurial activity to be unprotected. Consequently definitions of informality based on occupation and employer size seem the most arbitrary in practice even if conceptually well-founded.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine how athlete agents are regulated in the United States. The research determined that athlete agents are regulated by state statute, and these state statutes are not uniform among the states. Twenty-seven states have enacted statutes that govern athlete agents while twenty-three states have not deemed it necessary to control this profession. To determine which states have athlete agent statutes, the statutes of all fifty states were researched. Following this research, the five major requirements of athlete agents were extracted from the statutes and compared among the different states. These requirements included: <b>registration,</b> bonding, <b>contracts,</b> record keeping, and advertising. In addition to researching statutes, case law was examined to determine if there was any court decisions which set out laws or guidelines as to the practice of athlete agents. Finally the criminal penalties for violating an athlete agent statute were examined to determine what the possible penalties are that might be imposed. Law review articles, magazine articles, newspaper articles, and internet cites were also explored to find any instances in which athlete agents have violated state laws. The research determined that there is no uniform method in the regulation of athlete agents. Every statute that has been enacted is different. To effectively regulate the profession of athlete agents, a uniform standard was recommended- whether that is uniformity among state statutes, or federal legislation.

40|$|Abstract: The {{participation}} of an e-notary, acting as an on-line Trusted Third Party {{is required in}} some scenarios, such as Business to Business, Intellectual Property Rights contracting, or even as a legal requirement, in contract signing is frequently necessary. This e-notary gives validity to the contract or performs some tasks related to the contract, e. g. <b>contract</b> <b>registration.</b> In the abovementioned contracting scenarios, two important additional features are needed: the negotiation of the e-contract and confidentiality. However, until now, e-contract signing protocols have not considered these issues as {{an essential part of}} the protocol. In this paper, we present a new protocol which is designed to make negotiation and contract signing processes secure and confidential. Moreover, compared to other previous proposals based on an on-line Trusted Third Party, this protocol reduces the e-notary’s workload. Finally, we describe how the protocol is being used to achieve agreements on the rights of copyrighted works...|$|R

Strategic opportunities and ways to facilitate investment activities of enterprises in the light of such basic factors as the use of leasing, size and availability of tax credits are identified. Particularly the procedure of tax arrest and sale of tax property is suggested to be canceled, companies are encouraged to increase the declared income and number of employees in order to use company rules of the Tax Code and apply the 0 % rate for income tax. Realizing the shortage of funds in businesses the authors suggest to change the amount of fees for notarial <b>registration</b> of <b>contracts</b> and state dues of 5 % of a contract value to a constant amount. The authors consider it inappropriate and suggest to review the bank demands for companies that receive foreign currency loans, are engaged in export activities, provide information about the environmental and social standards compliance. The circumstances under which businesses can credit each other and the amount of loan can rise unilaterally are singled out. A number of recommendations to be used in leasing contracts are made. Since these steps should have a comprehensive approach to the regulation of company conditions the authors offer to show them as the basic policy and target blocks and the overall system activities to promote the investments...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: While two {{laboratory}} {{techniques are}} commonly {{used to assess the}} tensile properties of muscle tissue, emerging evidence suggests that the fascial components of these tissues also serve an active role in force generation. Hence, we investigated whether these techniques are sensitive for assessment of fascial micromechanics. Methods: Force measurements on dissected fascial tissue were performed either using the classical immersion organ bath or using an improved superfusion approach simulating pulsed pharmacological triggers. Rat deep dorsal fascial strips as well as rat testicular capsule were pharmacologically challenged either with mepyramine or oxytocin. Results: The classical immersion technique yielded a lower force response to mepyramine than the superfusion method (median: 367. 4 vs. 555. 4 µN/mm(2)). Pause in irrigation before application reduced irregularities during bolus application. The superfusion approach was improved further by the following points: The high sensitivity of the superfusion method to bolus addition was voided by deviation of fluid supply during bolus addition. Conclusion: Although both methods demonstrated pharmacologically induced contractile responses in lumbar fascia samples, the modified superfusion method may improve force <b>registrations</b> of slow <b>contracting</b> fascial tissue and minimize artefacts of fluid application...|$|R
30|$|Bitcoin is {{the first}} and most {{established}} DAO implemented to date. Since Bitcoin, there have been over 800 other DAOs created based on similar designs, most of which are considered to be “cryptocurrencies” (i.e., like Bitcoin, they allow for value exchange). At the time of writing, cryptocurrencies form an economy of $ 110 billion and make a real impact on the world. Some cryptocurrencies are developed based on the Bitcoin source code (e.g., Litecoin, Namecoin, Dash), while others started from scratch with their own protocol (e.g., Monero, Ethereum). Variations have also emerged to embrace a wider range of applications other than just payments, such as decentralized domain <b>registration</b> (Namecoin), smart <b>contracts</b> (Ethereum), and privacy (Monero). Proof-of-work mining is not anymore the only way to achieve machine consensus, as alternative or complementary schemes such as proof-of-stake (whereby the security proof is based on the amount of cryptocurrencies payment validators hold) or proof-of-burn (whereby the network is secured by validators allocating coins to an unspendable address) have been developed and implemented in recent years. Preliminary research suggests that DAO performance varies with the extent of governance decentralization (Hsieh et al. 2018), so understanding how various forms of machine and social consensus contribute to the success and failure of DAOs represents an exciting avenue for future organizational research.|$|R
40|$|The {{principles}} of “certainty” and “autonomy” {{are central to}} the Torrens system and contract law respectively. Courts seek to resolve conflict between these principles. Systemic incoherence is especially apparent when courts consider the all-obligations mortgage. The mortgage document does not only place a charge on title. It secures personal obligations also. Registration may or may not extend to these obligations. According to the laws of contract, these personal obligations are established by the substance {{of the relationship between the}} parties, illustrated by a structure of legal forms via the <b>contract.</b> <b>Registration</b> then purports to "animate” the contract through the legal form of "title/interest by registration”. Hence the title of this paper: the "Frankenstein Mortgage". The Torrens system requires jurisdictions to engage in a perpetual search for coherence. An awareness of the ideological disunion underlying the law of real property enables judges to subduct concepts in a congruent manner and achieve a semblance of a unified legal form. Rather than etiolating the Torrens principle of certainty through policy-based rationales, reforms require an examination of residuary common law principles and conceptual sources of law, combined with a consciousness of the illogical nature of lawmaking that must, to maximize practical efficacy, provide a compromise between the two systems...|$|R

40|$|Half {{a decade}} after Bitcoin became the first widely used cryptocurrency, blockchains are {{receiving}} considerable interest from industry and the research community. Modern blockchains feature services such as name <b>registration</b> and smart <b>contracts.</b> Some employ new forms of consensus, such as proof-of-stake instead of proof-of-work. However, these blockchains are so far relatively poorly investigated, {{despite the fact that}} they move considerable assets. In this paper, we explore three representative, modern blockchains [...] -Ethereum, Namecoin, and Peercoin. Our focus is on the features that set them apart from the pure currency use case of Bitcoin. We investigate the blockchains' activity in terms of transactions and usage patterns, identifying some curiosities in the process. For Ethereum, we are mostly interested in the smart contract functionality it offers. We also carry out a brief analysis of issues that are introduced by negligent design of smart contracts. In the case of Namecoin, our focus is how the name registration is used and has developed over time. For Peercoin, we are interested in the use of proof-of-stake, as this consensus algorithm is poorly understood yet used to move considerable value. Finally, we relate the above to the fundamental characteristics of the underlying peer-to-peer networks. We present a crawler for Ethereum and give statistics on the network size. For Peercoin and Namecoin, we identify the relatively small size of the networks and the weak bootstrapping process...|$|R
