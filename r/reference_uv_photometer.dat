The National Bureau of Standards provided a 'standard' ozone source for intercomparing the in situ instruments and ground pressure. Preliminary {{findings indicate that}} the standard deviation of the sensitivities among 17 instruments against the NBS reference was about 11 percent. These differences appear in flight at the lower levels and change at higher altitudes, indicating height-dependent errors. The difference among five in-situ <b>UV</b> <b>photometers</b> flown together ranged by plus or minus 8 percent during ascent to about 41 km. During float at 42 km, the difference nearly doubled.

Past measurements of ozone on Mars are highly uncertain, perhaps a factor of 3 or so uncertain, due primarily to interference and masking by cloud and dust. In-situ balloon measurements would avoid these problems, and would provide 'ground truth' which remote sensing techniques cannot.

40|$|Results of the NASA-JSC <b>UV</b> <b>photometer</b> from flights {{on large}} {{balloons}} during the MAP/GLOBUS campaing of September 1983 are reported. Profiles obtained on September 14 and 24 agree within uncertainties above {{a height of}} 36 mb (about 22. 5 km) indicating a degree of stability in the upper stratosphere. Measurements were made during ascent and descent of the first flight, and ascent of the second flight. Because the vertical descent rate of the first flight was five times lower than the ascent rate, more structure was obtained. Float altitudes of 32 km (8. 1 mb) for the first flight and 39 km (3. 1 mb) for the second flight were attained. Results from the photometer are compared with Nimbus 7 SBUV observations made at the same time. The profiles agree within 10 percent above the partial pressure peak. Above the ozone mixing ratio peak, the UV photometry values are about 1 ppmV lower for the second flight.

40|$|Following {{the amazing}} {{progresses}} in miniaturizing essential components of spacecraft, {{the last decade}} has witnessed an important development of nano- and micro-satellites. Beyond the mere technological experiment, these small satellites are now considered as important complements of much larger and more sophisticated probes to do scientific research. In this context we are conducting a feasibility study of a <b>UV</b> <b>photometer</b> on-board a 3 U CubeSat. The scientific purpose of this payload will be to collect time series of photometric measurements of bright massive stars. These massive stars are very hot and luminous objects emitting copious amounts of UV radiation. The properties of these stars during their life and their death in gigantic supernova explosions make them key players for the evolution of the Universe. The <b>UV</b> <b>photometer</b> will be used for imaging photometric observations of massive stars in the spectral range from 250 to 350 nm. The strength of space photometry is the absence of signal perturbation by the Earth’s atmosphere and the continuity of the time-series. Precisely measuring photometric variations allows studying radial and non-radial pulsations of stars. This discipline, called asteroseismology, is currently the most powerful technique for probing the physical conditions in the interiors of stars. An important problem in asteroseismology of massive stars is the mode identification. Simultaneous observations in the near UV (250 - 350 nm) and in the visible (600 nm) provide the best combination for precise and accurate mode identification based on amplitude ratios in massive stars. Data in the latter pass-band are currently covered by the satellites of the BRITE constellation. Combining the observations of our instrument with those of BRITE will hence result in unprecedented results for pulsating massive stars. The baseline for the <b>UV</b> <b>photometer</b> is a Ritchey-Chrétien telescope composed of two reflective hyperbolic mirrors that focalize the light coming from space onto a focal plane protected by an optical filter. We will present the optimized optical design of the payload and its associated optical sensor. A photometric budget taking into account the characteristics of the target’s stars and the payload performances will also be presented. We will further discuss the observation strategy. Finally, the accommodation of the payload in the spacecraft and its sub-units will be shown as well as mission and preliminary thermal analyses of the whole system obtained after accommodation...|$|R

They are prescribed UV protective sunglasses by dermatologists but their exact protecting effects are not known. Aim: To study the ultraviolet protective properties of branded and unbranded UV protective sunglasses available in the Indian market, in UV phototherapy chambers. Methods: Sixteen different branded and unbranded UV protective sunglasses were collected from two opticians in Mumbai. Baseline irradiance of the UV chamber was calculated by exposing the photosensitive probe of <b>UV</b> <b>photometer</b> in the chamber. Then, the photosensitive probe of the <b>UV</b> <b>photometer</b> was covered with the UV protective glass to be studied and irradiance was noted. Such readings were taken for each of the UV protective sunglasses. The percentage reduction in the UV rays&#x 2032; penetration of different UV protective sunglasses was calculated. Results: Thirteen sunglasses provided > 80 &#x 0025; reduction in UVA rays penetration, of which four were branded (out of the four branded studied) and nine were unbranded (out of the 12 unbranded studied). More than 70 &#x 0025; reduction in UVB penetration was provided by 12 sunglasses, which included 10 unbranded and two branded sunglasses. Conclusion: All branded sunglasses provided good protection against UVA penetration, but UVB protection provided by both branded and unbranded sunglasses was not satisfactory. A few unbranded sunglasses had poor efficacy for UVA and UVB spectra; one branded glass had poor efficacy for protection against the UVB spectrum. The efficacy of sunglasses used for phototherapy should be assessed before use...|$|R

Besides starch, crude fibre, amino acids (AAS), vitamins and minerals, the tubers contain diverse phenolic compounds. These phenolics and AAS confer anti-oxidant protection against reactiveoxygen species, tissue damage, and diseases like atherosclerosis, renal failure, diabetes mellitus,and cancer. Climate change and drought stress may become a major risk for crop production worldwide, resulting in reduced access for those who depend on the nutritional value of this staple crop. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the effect of drought stress on water, lipid soluble antioxidants, anthocyanins (Ac), soluble phenols, proteins, free AAS, peroxidase (POD) and lipid acyl hydrolase activity (LAH) in tuber tissue. Methods: The study was carried out on three potato genotypes comprising one yellow-fleshed cultivar and two purple breeding clones.

40|$|Ozone, an {{important}} greenhouse gas, {{has the largest}} climate forcing in the tropopause region, meaning that knowledge of long-term ozone changes in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) is particularly important. Here, we perform a 16 yr comparison (1994 – 2009) of UTLS ozone measurements from balloon-borne ozonesondes and MOZAIC (measurements of ozone, water vapor, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides by in-service Airbus aircraft). The analysis uses trajectories computed from ERA-Interim wind fields to find matches between the two measurement platforms. Ozonesonde data quality is most critical in the UTLS, where natural variability is high, particularly close to the tropopause. On average, at the 28 launch sites considered, ozone mixing ratios measured by the sondes exceed MOZAIC data by 5 – 15 %, with differences being smaller in the LS than in the UT at many launch sites. For most sites, sondes and MOZAIC data are in close agreement after 1998. Before 1998 ozone mixing ratios measured by the Brewer–Mast (BM) sondes and Electrochemical Concentration Cell (ECC) sondes are systematically (up to 20 %) higher than the MOZAIC <b>UV</b> <b>photometers.</b> The reason for this large difference remains unclear. Results also show that after 1998 large background current signals may affect ozonesonde performance, limiting the determination of reliable ozone trends in the UTLS. Sonde measurements appear to be insensitive to changing the type of ECC ozonesonde, provided the cathode sensing solution strength remains unchanged. Only Scoresbysund (Greenland) showed systematically higher readings after changing from Science Pump Corporation sondes to ENSCI Corporation sondes, while keeping a 1. 0 % KI cathode electrolyte.

The Harvard ozone passive sampler was used to monitor cohorts of 22 and 18 subjects for 8 weeks during the spring and fall of 1994, respectively. Ozone exposure variables included 12 -hr personal O 3 measurements, stationary outdoor O 3 measurements from a continuous <b>UV</b> <b>photometer</b> and from 12 -hr Harvard active monitors, and time-activity information. Results showed that personal O 3 exposure levels averaged one-fourth of outdoor stationary O 3 levels, attributable to high percentages of time spent indoors. Personal O 3 levels were not predicted well by outdoor measurements. A random-effect general linear model analysis indicated that variance in personal exposure measurements was largely accounted for by random error (59 - 82 %), followed by inter-subject (9 - 18 %) and between-day (9 - 23 %) random effects. The microenvironmental model performs differently by season, with the regression model for spring cohorts exhibiting two times the R 2 of the fall cohorts (R 2 = 0. 21 vs. 0. 09). When distance from the stationary monitoring site, elevation, and traffic are taken into account in the microenvironmental models, the adjusted R 2 increased almost twofold for the fall personal exposure data. The low predictive power is due primarily to the apparent spatial variation of outdoor O 3 and errors in O 3 measurements and in time-activity records (particularly in recording the use of air conditioning). This study highlights the magnitude of O 3 exposure misclassification in epidemiological settings and proposes an approach to reduce exposure uncertainties in assessing air pollution health effects.

Long-term measurements of tropospheric ozone have been performed globally for more than 30 years with <b>UV</b> <b>photometers,</b> all relying on the absorption of ozone at the 253. 65 nm line of mercury. We have re-determined this cross-section and report a value of 11. 27 x 10 − 18 cm 2 molecule − 1 with an expanded relative uncertainty of 0. 86 % (coverage factor k = 2). This is lower than the conventional value currently in use and measured by Hearn (1961) with a relative difference of 1. 8 %, with the consequence that historically reported ozone concentrations should be increased by 1. 8 %. In order to perform the new measurements of cross-sections with reduced uncertainties, a system was set up to generate pure ozone in the gas phase together with an optical system based on a UV laser with lines in the Hartley band, including accurate path length measurement of the absorption cell and a careful evaluation of possible impurities in the ozone sample by mass spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This resulted in new measurements of absolute values of ozone absorption cross-sections of 9. 48 x 10 − 18, 10. 44 x 10 − 18 and 11. 07 x 10 − 18 cm 2 molecule − 1, with relative expanded uncertainties better than 0. 7 %, for the wavelengths (in vacuum) of 244. 06, 248. 32, and 257. 34 nm respectively.

40|$|Scientific {{discovery}} {{is limited by}} finite experimental resources. Therefore, careful strategic planning is required when committing resources to an experiment. Often the decision to commit resources is based upon observations made from previous experiments. However real-world data is inherently noisy and often follows an underlying nonlinear trend. In such circumstances the decision to commit resources is unclear. Autonomous experimentation, where machine learning algorithms control an experimentation platform, is one approach {{that has the potential}} to deal with these issues and consequently could help drive scientific discoveries. In the context of applying autonomous experimentation to identify new behaviours from chemical or biological systems, the machine learning algorithms are limited by the capability of the hardware technology to generate on demand, complex mixtures {{from a wide range of}} chemicals. This limitation forms the basis for the work described in this thesis. Specifically this thesis documents the development of a hardware system which is designed to support scalability, is capable of automating processes, and is built from technology readily accessible to other researchers. The hardware system is derived from droplet microfluidic technology and allows for microscale biochemical samples of varying composition to be automatically created. During the development of the hardware system, technical challenges in fabrication, sensor system development, microfluidic design and mixing were encountered. Solutions to address these challenges were found and are presented as, fabrication techniques that enable integrated valve microfluidic devices to be created in a standard chemistry laboratory environment without need for sophisticated equipment, a compact <b>UV</b> <b>photometer</b> system built using optical semiconductor components, and a novel mixing strategy that increased the mixing efficiency of large droplets. Having addressed these technical challenges and in fulfilling the aims set out above, the work in this thesis has sufficiently improved hardware technology to free the machine learning algorithms from the constraint of working with just a few experimental variables.

40|$|Radical {{chemistry}} {{is a very}} convenient way to produce polymer materials. Here, an application of a particular photoinduced radical {{chemistry is}} illustrated. Seven new carbazole derivatives Cd 1 –Cd 7 are incorporated and proposed as high performance near-UV photoinitiators for both the free radical polymerization (FRP) of (meth) acrylates and the cationic polymerization (CP) of epoxides utilizing Light Emitting Diodes LEDs @ 405 nm. Excellent polymerization-initiating abilities are found and high final reactive function conversions are obtained. Interestingly, these new derivatives display much better near-UV polymerization-initiating abilities compared to a <b>reference</b> <b>UV</b> absorbing carbazole (CARET 9 H-carbazole- 9 -ethanol) demonstrating that the new substituents have good ability to red shift the absorption of the proposed photoinitiators. All the more strikingly, in combination with iodonium salt, Cd 1 –Cd 7 are likewise preferred as cationic photoinitiators over the notable photoinitiator bis(2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzoyl) phenylphosphine oxide (BAPO) for mild irradiation conditions featuring their remarkable reactivity. In particular their utilization {{in the preparation of}} new cationic resins for LED projector 3 D printing is envisioned. A full picture of the included photochemical mechanisms is given...|$|R
40|$|Fingerprints of self-shaded and sunlight-exposed {{leaves of}} the same Coffea arabica plant were {{obtained}} to determine metabolic concentration changes owing to different light environments and phenological stages. Leaf extract yields of the ethanol, acetone, dichloromethane and hexane solvents, {{as well as their}} statistical design mixtures, are reported. Highest yields are obtained with binary 1 : 1 ethanol-acetone mixtures for all sun-exposed and self-shaded leaves. Principal component analysis (PCA) of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of leaf extracts indicate spectral differences between 2962 - 2828, 1759 - 1543 and below 1543 cm- 1 that can be attributed to higher concentrations of fatty acid esters or the ester group in triglycerides, caffeine, chlorogenic acids and carbohydrates that are more prevalent in leaves of flowering plants. Highperformance liquid chromatography with UV diode array detector (HPLC-UV-DAD) spectra of the chromatographic peaks for the extracts showed that sun-exposed samples contain stronger absorptions for caffeine, chlorogenic acid and theobromine. Confirmatory experiments carried out with <b>reference</b> <b>UV</b> calibration curves determined caffeine contents for sun-exposed leaves that are about double those for self-shaded leaves of flowering plants. Knowledge of leaf caffeine content in Coffea arabica is of ecological importance since sun-exposed conditions seem more stressful than self-shading ones for this species. Lipid concentrations in self-shaded leaves are almost double those that were sun-exposed...|$|R
50|$|The {{deuterium}} lamp emits radiation extending from 112 nm to 900 nm, although its continuous spectrum is only from 180 nm to 370 nm. The spectrum intensity does not actually decrease from 250 nm to 300 nm {{as shown in}} the spectrum plot above. The decrease in the plot is due to decreased efficiency at low wavelengths of the photo detector used to measure the lamp intensity. The {{deuterium lamp}}'s continuous spectrum is useful as both a <b>reference</b> in <b>UV</b> radiometric work and to generate a signal in various photometric devices.|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical Concentration Cell (ECC) ozone {{instruments}} {{depend on}} the quality of care exercised in their pre-flight preparation. The ozone-measuring project conducted at Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility uses a number of mechanisms designed to inspect the ECC for anomalies that may interfere with the reception of valid ozone profiles. Complete electronic testing of the instrument, individually and when coupled to its radiosonde has led to exceptional monitoring of ozone for detecting long-term atmospheric changes. A number of factors are considered when preparing an ECC instrument for flight. These basically are specific calibrations of pump efficiency, volumetric flow rate, temperature of the air entering the pump, and background current. The concentration of the potassium iodide solution is also important. Wallops is the only site using a <b>UV</b> <b>photometer</b> (Dasibi) to compare ECC ozone output at various concentrations of ozone that allows adjustment to be made to offsets that may appear in the balloon-borne instrument prior to release. All of the above procedures allow identification of potential problems before release of the ECC instrument. Procedures followed at Wallops also are employed in Brazil, and Ascension Island where NASA has cooperative agreements in place to obtain ozonesondes data. All ECC instruments are prepared 3 - 4 weeks prior to the day of observation. We will briefly describe the instrumental tests employed. These tests have included simultaneous dual observations to compare the effect of different solution concentrations, comparison of sensors of different manufacturers, and comparisons with surface- and space-based instrumentation such as the Dobson Spectrophotometer and satellites. Vertical profiles of ozone from Arctic, mid-latitudes, and Antarctica will be discussed. Although not unusual, the data reveals ozone structure that correlate well with typical atmospheric temperatures and possibly relative humidity. Finally, vertical ozone distribution, compared with remotely measured ozone from lidar and satellite, will be discussed. Specific comparisons between ECC and HALOE measurements, integrated ECC total ozone overburden with the EP-TOMS and the Dobson, as well as comparisons with lidar are discussed. Results show agreement and some disagreement between the in situ measurements of the ECC and the remote instruments. We postulate reasons for the differences, or biases, which in spite of the excellent ECC quality control during pre-flight preparation and data analysis processes, may be due to uncertainties in both measuring systems...|$|R
40|$|Understanding of the tropospheric {{mid-latitude}} ozone {{trends in}} the free troposphere depends on several forcing mechanisms varying in different directions: change of continental emissions, Sratosphere-Troposphere Exchange (STE), upward ozone flux from the boundary layer (BL) and long range transport. The western Mediterranean is a well suited region to study the change of European emission but also the role of long range transport of other continental emissions (Ravetta et al., 2007). Moreover, Wilson et al., 2012, show a difference of ozone trend in south Europe compared to north and central Europe but south Europe is much less represented. In this work, the tropospheric ozone variability is derived from regular vertical profiles obtained using two types of instruments during the time period 1990 - 2010 at Observatoire de Haute Provence in Southern France (44 N, 6 E) which {{is included in the}} NDACC network: ECC balloon borne ozonesondes and a UV DIAL lidar. The latter provides data in the altitude range 3 - 14 km. A ground based <b>UV</b> <b>photometer</b> is also used since 1998. Seasonal variations in 2 -km layers in the troposphere (2 - 8 km) for four five years periods were analysed with 3 -days three dimensional backward trajectories calculated for each vertical profile during twenty years. Four source regions are identified: [Europe (lat> 45 N) ], [Eastern Mediterranean], [Spain/Africa/North America (lat 40 N) ]. Considering lidar and ozonesondes data seperatly we cannot identify a clear bias due to the measurement method while differences are related to the sampling conditions. Using lidar and ECC observation together, we have shown that there is a good correlation between ozone variability and changes of the transport pattern in the free troposphere, but no significant trends are observed above 3 km. In the lower troposphere, there is, however, a significant downward trend which is linked to the evolution of the planetary boundary layer height and changes in continental emissions. We will show also a joint analysis of ozone layers and the climatology of aerosol and water vapor layers. Water vapor profiles are obtained from the VAÏSALA sondes flown with the ECC sonde since 1990. The aerosol profiles are provided by the CALIPSO mission since 2006 using a trajectory approach to get a better matching between OHP observations and satellite data...|$|R
40|$|We report {{measurements}} of CH 4 (measured in situ by the Harvard University Picarro Cavity Ringdown Spectrometer (HUPCRS) and NOAA Unmanned Aircraft System Chromatograph for Atmospheric Trace Species (UCATS) instruments), O 3 (measured in situ by the NOAA dual-beam ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> <b>photometer),</b> NO 2, BrO (remotely detected by spectroscopic UV–visible (UV–vis) limb observations; see the companion paper of Stutz et al., 2016), and of some key brominated source gases in whole-air {{samples of the}} Global Hawk Whole Air Sampler (GWAS) instrument within the subtropical lowermost stratosphere (LS) and the tropical upper troposphere (UT) and tropopause layer (TTL). The measurements were performed {{within the framework of}} the NASA-ATTREX (National Aeronautics and Space Administration – Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment) project from aboard the Global Hawk (GH) during six deployments over the eastern Pacific in early 2013. These measurements are compared with TOMCAT/SLIMCAT (Toulouse Off-line Model of Chemistry And Transport/Single Layer Isentropic Model of Chemistry And Transport) 3 -D model simulations, aiming at improvements of our understanding of the bromine budget and photochemistry in the LS, UT, and TTL. Changes in local O 3 (and NO 2 and BrO) due to transport processes are separated from photochemical processes in intercomparisons of measured and modeled CH 4 and O 3. After excellent agreement is achieved among measured and simulated CH 4 and O 3, measured and modeled [NO 2] are found to closely agree with [*]≤[*]  15  ppt in the TTL (which is the detection limit) and within a typical range of 70 to 170  ppt in the subtropical LS during the daytime. Measured [BrO] ranges between 3 and 9  ppt in the subtropical LS. In the TTL, [BrO] reaches 0. 5  ±  0. 5  ppt at the bottom (150  hPa∕ 355  K∕ 14  km) and up to about 5  ppt at the top (70  hPa∕ 425  K∕ 18. 5  km; see Fueglistaler et al., 2009 for the definition of the TTL used), in overall good agreement with the model simulations. Depending on the photochemical regime, the TOMCAT∕SLIMCAT simulations tend to slightly underpredict measured BrO for large BrO concentrations, i. e., in the upper TTL and LS. The measured BrO and modeled BrO ∕ Bryinorg ratio is further used to calculate inorganic bromine, Bryinorg. For the TTL (i. e., when [CH 4] [*]≥[*]  1790  ppb), [Bryinorg] is found to increase from a mean of 2. 63  ±  1. 04  ppt for potential temperatures (θ) in the range of 350 – 360  K to 5. 11  ±  1. 57  ppt for θ [*]=[*] 390 [*]−[*] 400  K, whereas in the subtropical LS (i. e., when [CH 4] [*]≤[*]  1790  ppb), it reaches 7. 66  ±  2. 95  ppt for θ in the range of 390 – 400  K. Finally, for the eastern Pacific (170 – 90 ° W), the TOMCAT/SLIMCAT simulations indicate a net loss of ozone of − 0. 3  ppbv day− 1 at the base of the TTL (θ [*]=[*]  355  K) and a net production of + 1. 8  ppbv day− 1 in the upper part (θ [*]=[*]  383  K) ...|$|R
40|$|Nesta tese, dois projetos distintos que usaram a técnica do Espalhamento de Luz foram desenvolvidos. Estudou-se a influência de soluções concentradas de uréia sobre agregados supra{{molecular}}es de anfifilicos (ASAś), através de condutimetria, supressão de fluorescência e espalhamento de luz. A uréia causou aumento da concentração micelar crítica (CMC) em todos os sistemas micelares estudados. A uréia diminuiu a seletividade da ligação iônica entre cloreto e brometo em micelas de haleto de cetil-trimetil-amônio, estudada através de supressão de fluorescência. Este aditivo causou também aumento na segunda CMC de brometo de tetradeciltrimetil- amônio (TTAB) e diminuição do peso molecular das micelas em bastão formadas. Concluiu-se, desta primeira parte, que a uréia tende a interferir nas transições de fase apresentadas em sistemas micelares, provavelmente através da combinação dos mecanismos direto e indireto. A uréia apresenta potencial para uso como aditivo para modulação das propriedades estruturais de sistemas micelares. Na segunda parte da tese desenvolveu-se um sistema, baseado em espalhamento de luz, capaz de monitorar o peso molecular de polímeros durante a polimerização. O sistema foi eficiente no monitoramento da polimerização da N-vinil-pirrolidinona, mostrando que o peso molecular do polímero formado é constante durante a maior parte da reação. As teorias atuais de cinética de polimerização não foram capazes de explicar esse comportamento. Light scattering techniques (static and dynamic) {{were used}} to detenninate the effect of urea on supramolecular aggregates and to monitor on-line molar mass ofpolymerization reactions. For {{the first set of}} investigation it was already established that urea increases the CMC and the dissociation degree (&# 945;) of ionic micelles (CTABr, TTABr, and SDS). From fluorescence suppression studies it was found that urea diminishes the ionic binding in zwitterionic and cationic micelles as well as in cationic vesicles. Bromide and chloride ionic selectivity in cationic micelles was found to nearly disappear in the presence of urea. Light scattering (static) detenninations showed that the weight averaged molecular weight (Mw) ofboth SDS and CTABr are invariant by the presence of the denaturant. A slight increase in the excluded volume tenn (A 2) was detected for CTABr in the presence of 3 M urea. In parallel both A 2 and the radius of gyration (&# 947;) of two polyelectrolytes (PAA and Hyaluronic acid) were not affected by the presence of urea. Sphere-to-rod concentration transitions (2 nd CMC) of TIABr micelles increased in the presence of urea and the MW of rod particles were observed to decrease. For the insoluble mixture of CTABr/Polystyrenesulfonate solubilization was achieved in the presence of 3 M urea. These set of results were explained {{as a result of the}} dual effect of urea, that is, the indirect effect by changing the properties of the solvent and the direct effect by solvating the hydrophilic domain of the aggregates and contributing with a stronger dipole moment. The second set of experiments was directed towards the real-time, on-line monitoring of Mw of polymerization reactions. This new approach could be succeeded by the coupling a light scattering detector, an <b>UV</b> <b>photometer</b> and a differential refractometer on line with a HPLC system. Mw growth formed in the polymerization of N-vynil-pirrolidone was accomplished with a small inherent error. Within the studied conditions Mw reached a plateau at early polymerization stages, after that only an increase in the number of polymer kinetic chains was observed. Current kinetic models were unable to predict the observed Mw growth pattern. This system is of great importance in basic and technological applications by virtue of its on-line capability...|$|R
40|$|Ozone (O 3) {{measurements}} are {{a critical component}} of air quality management and many atmospheric chemistry laboratory experiments. Conventional ozone monitoring devices based on UV absorption are relatively cumbersome and expensive, and have a relative high power consumption that limits their use to fixed sites. In this study electrochemical O 3 sensors (OXB 421, Alphasense) were used in a miniaturised O 3 measurement device combined with LabJack and Labview data acquisition (DAQ). The device required a power supply of 5  V direct current (VDC) with a total power consumption of approximately 5  W. Total weight was less than 0. 5  kg, low enough for portable in situ field deployment. The electrochemical O 3 sensors produced a voltage signal positively proportional to O 3 concentrations over the range of 5  ppb– 10  ppm. There was excellent agreement between the performances of two O 3 sensors with a good linear coefficient (R 2  =  0. 9995). The influences of relative humidity (RH) and gas sample flow rate on sensor calibrations and sensitivities have been investigated separately. Coincident calibration curves indicate that sensor performances were almost identical even at different RHs and flow rates after a re-zeroing process to offset the sensor baseline drifts. Rapid RH changes (∼ 20 %/min) generate significant and instant changes in sensor signal, and the sensors consistently take up to 40  min to recover their original values after such a rapid RH change. In contrast, slow RH changes (∼ 0. 1 %/min) had little effect on sensor response. To test the performance of the miniaturised O 3 device for real-world applications, the O 3 sensors were employed for (i) laboratory experiments to measure O 3 loss by seawater uptake and (ii) air quality monitoring over an 18 -day period. It was found that ozone uptake by seawater was linear to the volume of linoleic acid on a sea surface microlayer and the calculated uptake coefficients based on sensor measurements were close to those from previous studies. For the 18 -day period of air quality monitoring the corrected data from the O 3 sensor was in a good agreement with those obtained by <b>reference</b> <b>UV</b> O 3 analyser with an r 2 of 0. 83 (n =  8502). The novelty {{of this study is that}} the electrochemical O 3 sensor was comprehensively investigated in O 3 measurements in both laboratory and ambient air quality monitoring and it can to be a miniaturised alternative for conventional O 3 monitoring devices due to its low cost, low power-consumption, portable and simple-conduction properties...|$|R
