40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{elucidate}} the behavior of <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> in penetrating human skin without the presence of enhancers by using confocal Raman spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation. Methods In this study, in vivo confocal Raman spectroscopy was combined with molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the transdermal permeation of the aqueous suspension of <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> Results Permeation was measured after 30  min, and <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> was found up to 20  m deep inside the stratum corneum. The delivery of <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> inside a skin membrane model was studied by molecular dynamics. The membrane model that was used represented normal young skin containing a lipid bilayer with 25 % ceramide, 36 % fatty acid, 30 % cholesterol, and 6 % cholesterol sulfate. Conclusion Spectroscopy data indicate that <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> permeates into the stratum corneum. Molecular dynamics data showed that <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> permeates in the membrane model and that their final location is deep inside the lipid bilayer. We showed, for the first time, a correlation between Raman permeation data and computational data. C. A.

40|$|Present {{project was}} planned to {{alleviate}} the vitamin A deficiency in pregnant and lactating women by providing vitamin A fortified cookies. For the purpose, cookies were prepared by adding two vitamin A fortificants i. e. <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and retinyl palmitate separately @ 30, 40 and 50 % RDA of pregnant (750 µg) and lactating (1200 µg) women. During storage studies, moisture content and TBA no. of the cookies were increased from 2. 51 to 2. 84 % and 0. 40 to 0. 69 mg malenaldehyde/Kg, respectively. Vitamin A losses during baking and storage ranged from 7. 95 to 15. 79 % and 8. 02 to 9. 69 %, respectively, among the treatments. On the basis of physico-chemical analysis, baking & storage stability and sensoric attributes, T 4 (50 % of RDA; <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> and T 7 (50 % of RDA; retinyl palmitate) were selected for efficacy purposes. Selected treatments (Five cookies; 50 g per day) along with placebo were provided to the respective groups of vitamin A deficient pregnant women in third trimester. <b>Retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and retinyl palmitate fortified cookies significantly enhanced the level of serum retinol 18. 51 % and 21. 56 % in pregnant women and 9. 43 and 12. 84 % in lactating mothers, respectively. In placebo group, the serum retinol level was significantly decreased up to 9. 32 % during pregnancy with a non-significant increase 1. 81 % during lactation. Collectively, the serum retinol level showed a significant increase of 29. 69 % and 37. 16 % in <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and retinyl palmitate groups, respectively during six months whereas, a significant decrease (7. 68 %) was found in placebo group. Moreover, significant decrease was observed in retinyl esters level during pregnancy and lactation period; 35. 90 and 32. 00 % in <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and retinyl palmitate groups, respectively. Similarly, the placebo group also showed significant decrease in retinyl esters (64. 84 %). The level of β-carotene showed significant decrease in all treatments during pregnancy and lactation. Overall, T 1 (placebo) differed entirely from other groups with 36. 45 % decrease as compared to groups receiving <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (8. 18 %) and retinyl palmitate (6. 98 %) fortified cookies. Red blood cells (RBC) indices like, hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) significantly decreased in experimental groups during pregnancy, however, RBC indices depicted {{a significant increase in}} all groups during lactation.

40|$|Involucrin {{accumulation}} and ionophore-assisted envelope for mation, {{markers of}} keratinocyte differentiation, {{were found to}} be highly dependent on culture conditions in the malignant epidermal keratinocyte line, SCC- 13, derived from a human squamous cell carcinoma. In confluent cultures, approximately one-half of the cells were competent to form envelopes when grown in medium without hydrocortisone or <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> supplementation. Ad dition of hydrocortisone to the medium during growth resulted in up to 90 % competence, while addition of <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> instead resulted in as low as 10 % competence. Hydrocortisone partially antagonized the effect of <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> when both agents were added together. Involucrin levels, measured by radioimmunoassay, were modulated essentially in parallel with envelope com petence under the various conditions tested. When the cells were grown in medium supplemented with hydrocortisone, the levels shortly after confluence were over 50 -fold higher than in sparse cultures. Regardless of hydrocortisone or <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> addition, less than 1 % of the cells were competent in sparse cultures of growing cells, but up to 90 % exhibited this property after growth arrest in serum-free medium containing hydrocortisone. High levels of competence were correlated with cessation of cell division but not with loss of colony-forming efficiency; under optimal conditions, two-thirds of the cells were capable of both envelope formation and colony initiation. Normal human epidermal cells showed a 4 - to 5 -fold increase in envelope competence from sparse to confluent culture but were insensitive to the suppressive effect of <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> The results suggest that some potential differentiated character of malignant keratinocytes may be suppressed in vivo by physiological agents such as vitamin A...|$|E
40|$|Cells from mouse epidermis, a keratinizing tissue, when cultured in the {{presence}} of <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> display the phenotype of a secreting epithelium. Retinyl acetate- treated cultures incorporated labeled galactose, mannose, and glucosamine into glycopeptides to a higher extent than their solvent-treated controls; the stimulation of mannose and galactose incorporation was apparent within 2 to 3 h from the addition of <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> to the culture medium. <b>Retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> treatment did not significantly alter the level of [Wlglucose in the culture medium, over a 24 -h period, nor did it affect the incorporation of labeled uridine into RNA. Epidermal cells in culture synthesized retinyl phosphate and doubly labeled mannosylretinyl phosphate in {{the presence}} of [15 - 3 H]retinol and [Wlmannose. Both products yielded [3 H]anhydroretinol by mild alkaline hydrolysis in the lipid phase. [W]Mannosyl phosphate was released in the water phase and yielded [‘TImannose after strong acid hydrolysis. Microsomes from mouse epidermal cells synthesized rC]mannosylretinyl phosphate from GDP-[“Clmannose. The synthesis of this compound in vitro was stimulated by exogenous retinyl phosphate. Epidermal cells actively incorporated radioactively labeled galactose into galactolipids. A minor compound with chromatographic characteristics of a galactosyl derivative of retinyl phosphate was isolated. However, this product was stable to hydrolysis with mild alkali, thus excluding the possibility that it is a derivative of retinyl phosphate. These results demonstrate that <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> markedly alters glycoprotein synthesis in epidermal cells. It is further suggested that this alteration is mediated via the synthesis of retinyl phosphate and mannosylretinyl phosphate.

40|$|Genetically {{enhanced}} high-carotene Beta III hybrid carrot {{was compared}} to a commercial carrot cultivar, Nantes Careless, for carotene content and macronutrient composition. Beta III contained {{more than twice the}} total carotene content of Nantes Careless, with α-carotene/β-carotene ratios higher in Beta III. Total solids from protein, lipids, and carbohydrate were greater in Beta III than in Nantes Careless. Beta III contained about five times the amount of sucrose and one-fifth the amount of glucose and fructose than Nantes Careless or reported literature values. Comparison of the bioavailability of carotenes in Beta III and Nantes Careless to purified β-carotene and <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> standards was made using two bioassays: the liver storage, slope-ratio assay and a curative growth study. Beta III provided liver retinol stores equivalent to stores provided by Nantes Careless, β-carotene, and <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> at dosage 300 RE. At 600 RE, only <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> increased liver retinol storage with dose. Carotene sources did not increase liver retinol storage, presumably owing to the mechanisms that prevent carotene vitamin A toxicity. Growth study results indicated vitamin A potency of Beta III was not equivalent to that provided by <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> Slopes of the growth response curves for Nantes Careless and β-carotene were not significantly different from retinyl acetate; the slope of the Beta III growth response curve was significantly different. All carotene sources were similar to <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> in the curvilinear response of the growth curves. The appropriate fit of the quadratic function to the growth response curves suggested 12 RE/d was greater than requirement. The differences in results of the two bioassays used to determine bioavailability of carotenes in Beta III may be explained by a number of factors. The utilization of β-carotene from Beta III may be affected by a-carotene or other carrot constituents for absorption or conversion to vitamin A, or both. Stored liver retinol may be a combination of retinol and a-retinol with reduced vitamin A activity. The growth assay may be more sensitive to external variables that cannot be controlled...|$|E

While radiation strongly affected the expression of stress response, immune/inflammation and nucleic acid metabolism genes, the retinoid most strongly affected proliferation-related genes, including some significant reversals, such as, keratin 14, retinol binding protein, and calcium binding proteins. These results point to reversal of proliferation-relevant genes as a likely basis for the anti-radiogenic effects of dietary <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of ornithine decarboxylase (OD-Case:L-ornithine carboxy-lyase, EC 4. 1. 1. 17) in rabbit costal chondrocytes in culture increased markedly after addition of parathyroid hormone (PTH), reaching a maximum 4 to 5 hr after PTH addition. The increase in ODCase activity {{was followed by}} increase in the intracellular concentrations of polyamines, especially putrescine, which increased in 6 hr to about 3 -fold that of untreated cultures. The induction of ODCase by PTH was not observed in L, 3 T 3, HeLa, buffalo rat liver, or BHK cells. <b>Retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and retinoic acid both inhibited expression of the differentiated phenotype of chondrocytes by rabbit costal chondrocytes in culture within 3 days after their addition, as judged by morphological change and decrease in sulfate incorporation into glycosaminoglycans but did not inhibit cell proliferation. PTH could not induce an increase in ODCase in de-differentiated cells that had been pretreated with <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> or retinoic acid for 3 days. but 4 days after removal of the retinoids, these de-differentiated cells regained the ability to synthesize ODCase in response to PTH. These facts suggest that the induction of ODCase {{and the formation of}} putrescine by PTH are good markers of the differentiated phenotype of cultured chondrocytes...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY-The {{influence}} of {{high levels of}} vitamin A on the susceptibility of respiratory-tract epithelium to the metaplastogenic and tumorigenic effects of 3 -methylcholanthrene (MCA) was tested in rats. Fischer- 344 rats were maintained on a vitamin A-Free diet and were given either 1740 J. Lg or 2 X 87 J. Lg <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> twice a week intragastrically. At 9 weeks of age each rat received 2 intratracheal injections of 5 mg MCA. Groups of 4 - 5 rats were killed 2, 3, 5, 8, and 12 weeks after carcinogen administration. Vitamin A storage in the liver, assessed at 3 different times, corresponded to the vitamin A dose. The number of microscopic hyperplastic and metaplastic lesions and grossly visible tumor nodules per rat lung was determined. The development of squamous metaplasias and squamous cell tumors was significantly reduced in rats receiving a high dose of <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> Our experiments confirm earlier findings suggesting an inhibitory effect of vitamin A {{on the development of}} respiratory-tract tumors in hamsters. -J Natl Cancer Inst 50 : 1599 - 1606, 1973.

40|$|Serially {{propagated}} SCC- 13 keratinocytes, {{derived from}} a human squamous cell carcinoma, are greatly influenced by culture conditions {{in their ability to}} form ionophore-inducible cross-linked envelopes. Supplementation of the growth medium with fetal bovine serum at concentrations ranging from 0. 5 to 20 percent had little effect on competence to form envelopes in confluent cultures. At each serum concentration, however, addition of hydrocortisone to the medium led to an increase in competence of almost fourfold, from approximately 20 to nearly 80 percents With the serum supplementation held at 5 percent, addition of <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> to the medium suppressed competence in a concentration-dependent manner over the range of 1 to 100 ng/ml, At the highest concentration employed, competence was reduced over fourfold in the presence of hydrocortisone and virtually eliminated in its absence. When the cells were grown using serum depleted of endogenous vitamin A, a majority were competent in the absence of hydrocortisone. Under this condition, <b>retinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> suppressed competence over fivefold in the absence of hydrocortisone, but not at all in its presence. We conclude that hydrocortisone stimulates envelope competence primarily by antagonizing the suppressive effect of vitamin A, The SCC- 13 cell line may prove valuable in studying mechanisms of retinoid and corticosteroid therapeutic action on diseased human keratinocytes...|$|E
