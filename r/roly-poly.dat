25|$|An early running gag {{involved}} Gaston {{coming up}} with elaborate and extremely impractical costumes for fancy dress parties at the facetious suggestions of his colleagues: <b>Roly-poly</b> toy, octopus, Greek urn, petrol pump, Eiffel Tower etc. He was invariably worried about whether {{he would be able}} to dance with the outfit on. Once, he dressed as the Marsupilami.|$|E
25|$|In geometry, a {{body with}} a single stable resting {{position}} is called monostatic, and the term mono-monostatic has been coined to describe a body which additionally has only one unstable point of balance. (The previously known monostatic polyhedron does not qualify, as it has three unstable equilibria.) A sphere weighted so that its center of mass is shifted from the geometrical center is a mono-monostatic body. A more common example is the Comeback Kid, Weeble or <b>roly-poly</b> toy (see left figure). Not only {{does it have a}} low center of mass, but it also has a specific shape. At equilibrium, the center of mass and the contact point are on the line perpendicular to the ground. When the toy is pushed, its center of mass rises and also shifts away from that line. This produces a righting moment which returns the toy to the equilibrium position.|$|E
500|$|Potter was at Hill Top in July 1906 {{during the}} {{development}} of Miss Moppet, and the kitten she borrowed as a model from a mason from Windermere was a difficult subject. [...] "n exasperating model," [...] Potter wrote, [...] "I have borrowed a Kitten and I am rather glad of the opportunity of working at the drawings. It is very young and pretty and a most fearful pickle." [...] Biographer Linda Lear explains that [...] "pickle" [...] was a word Potter used to describe [...] "free-thinking exuberant people, like her cousin Caroline, or mischievous kittens and small children." [...] Potter used the same drawings of the kitten {{as a model for}} her next book, The Tale of Tom Kitten, which she dedicated in 1907 [...] "to all Pickles—especially those that get upon my garden wall". Miss Moppet is one of Tom Kitten's sisters, and appears as a character in both books featuring him: The Tale of Tom Kitten and The Tale of Samuel Whiskers or The <b>Roly-Poly</b> Pudding (1908).|$|E
2500|$|The group {{released}} a limited edition re-issue of John Travolta Wannabe, titled <b>Roly-Poly</b> in Copacabana, on August 2, 2011. The title track, [...] "Roly-Poly in Copacabana", is a eurodance remix of [...] "Roly-Poly", {{named after the}} song [...] "Copacabana" [...] which was popularized in the 80's in Jongno disco clubs. The album peaked at number three, while the single peaked at number forty and forty-five on the Gaon and Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100 charts. The group began follow up promotions for the remixed single on Music Bank.|$|E
2500|$|Its overall {{shape is}} of a roundish profile, soon nicknamed [...] "Daruma" [...] for a Japanese <b>roly-poly</b> doll - {{this is the}} {{smallest}} (and arguably the only Kei Jidosha) car to use the [...] "coke bottle styling" [...] which became popular in the United States for the 1965 model year. The wheelbase was , the suspension independent with coil springs and the engine was an all new 356cc three-cylinder air-cooled two-cycle unit which was also called the LC10. The transmission was a four-speed manual, originally with synchromesh on the top three gears only. In a break with Fronte's front-wheel drive traditions, the powertrain was placed transversely in the rear, as was becoming the norm for kei cars of the period. The LC10 Fronte was dubbed the [...] "Queen of the keis" [...] by Suzuki's marketing department - a claim which may have influenced Subaru to name their 360 replacement the [...] "Rex".|$|E
2500|$|Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post {{gave the}} film 3.5/4 stars, writing that [...] "The real appeal of Big Hero 6 isn't its action. It's the central character's heart." [...] Maricar Estrella of Fort Worth Star-Telegram gave the film 5 stars, saying it [...] "offers {{something}} for everyone: action, camaraderie, superheroes and villains. But mostly, Baymax offers a compassionate and healing voice for those suffering, and a hug {{that can be}} felt through the screen." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, stating, [...] "The breakthrough star of the season is here. His name is Baymax and he's impossible not to love. The 3-D animated Big Hero 6 would be a ton less fun without this irresistible blob of <b>roly-poly,</b> robot charisma." [...] Kofi Outlaw of Screen Rant gave the film 4 out of 5 stars or [...] "excellent," [...] explaining that [...] "Big Hero 6 combines Disney wonder and charm with Marvel awe and action to deliver a film that exhibits {{the best of both}} studios." [...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap gave the film a positive review, calling it [...] "sweet and sharp and exciting and hilarious" [...] and says that the film [...] "comes to the rescue of what's become a dreaded movie trope—the origin story—and launches the superhero tale to pleasurable new heights." [...] Calvin Wilson of St. Louis Post-Dispatch gave the film 3.5 of 4 stars, writing that [...] "the storytelling is solid, propelled by characters that you come to care about. And that should make Big Hero 6 a big hit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gwynn's {{physical}} appearance defied his athleticism. He stood , thick {{around the middle}} and thighs. Even at his athletic prime when he could really run, he weighed around [...] and was considered pudgy. His <b>roly-poly</b> frame was a self-described [...] "body by Betty Crocker", {{a reference to the}} food product brand. Towards the end of his breakout season in 1984, he conceded that his [...] "extra weight hasn't helped me. My bat's slower than it has been all year." [...] At the time, he attributed his weight gain to soft drinks: [...] "It's killing me. It's always been a weakness. I've gotta cut down on the soda pop." [...] Jim Murray of the Los Angeles Times opined in 1993 that Gwynn's [...] "deceptive" [...] looks and not [...] "look the part" [...] contributed to his regularly being overlooked in the voting for league MVP. Gwynn was sensitive about his weight. His knee injuries over his career prompted the Padres organization, media, and fans to question his weight, conditioning, and eating habits. However, he rejected the notion that his weight led to his injuries. Gwynn contended that his weight was only a topic when he was struggling, and not when he was performing. He also believed that the criticism stemmed mainly from his not fitting people's profile of what an athlete should look like. He said he had [...] "a football player's body", with his father, grandfather and brothers also being big. Gwynn said his hitting style put a lot of torque on his knees. He started experiencing problems with his legs in 1986, when he suffered from shin splints. In his career, he had 13 operations, including eight involving his knees. Limited by injuries, he played over 135 games just once in his final 11 seasons. Gwynn used to run a great deal to keep in shape, but his last five years were mostly limited to working out in the gym. His actual weight is generally thought to have been under-reported during the latter part of his career, when it was officially listed between [...]|$|E
