50|$|The <b>rufous-bellied</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus rufiventris) is a {{songbird}} of the thrush family (Turdidae). It {{occurs in}} most of east and southeast Brazil from Maranhão south to Rio Grande do Sul states, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and northern regions of Argentina. In Brazil it {{is known as the}} robin.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} named after its {{distinctive}} reddish-orange underparts. <b>Rufous-bellied</b> <b>thrushes</b> can reach a length of 25 cm and weigh up to 68 g (male) or 78 g (female), though weights of about 59 g for males and 64 g for females are more usual. Contrary to what one might expect from the rather marked weight difference, the females are not larger, only plumper; their tarsus is actually a bit shorter than that of males on average.|$|R

50|$|Alejo Castex is {{the only}} paved street and it is lined with tall trees and weekend-houses; only can be heard the bird songs of {{thousands}} of <b>rufous-bellied</b> <b>thrushes,</b> chalk-browed mockingbirds, rufous horneros and the far-away roar of tractors working on the farms.Veinte de Junio only counts with a general store, a kindergarten, and a primary and secondary public school; for almost everything the town depends from the nearby city of Pontevedra, in Merlo Partido.For many residents the isolation {{is the cause of}} the lack of development of the town; for many others it’s a blessing because the remoteness makes Veinte de Junio a safe place to live, a place where crime and delinquency are very rare.The town grew around a railway station built {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century by the French-owned company Compagnie Générale de Chemins de Fer dans la Province de Buenos Aires, 4 km from Pontevedra. In fact, by those days the station was known as Estación Pontevedra.The land around the station was urbanized forty years later, in 1947, and it was known as Parque Ibáñez-Estación Pontevedra, but its name changed in 1949 when the partidos boundaries of Merlo and La Matanza were established. The railway station was left within the jurisdiction of La Matanza, while Pontevedra then came within the jurisdiction of Merlo.|$|R

In this study we investigated the influence of the degree of urbanization and environmental heterogeneity on helminth richness, abundance and community structure of <b>rufous-bellied</b> <b>thrushes</b> (Turdus rufiventris) along a rural-urban gradient in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. This common native bird species of southern Brazil hosts 15 endoparasite species at the study region. A total of 144 thrushes were collected with mist nets at 11 sites. The degree of urbanization and environmental heterogeneity were estimated by quantifying five landscape elements: buildings, woodlands, fields, bare lands, and water. Landscape analyses were performed at two spatial scales (10 and 100 ha) taking into account home range size and the potential dispersal distance of thrushes and their prey (intermediate hosts). Mean parasite richness showed an inverse relationship with the degree of urbanization, but a positive relationship with environmental heterogeneity. Changes in the structure of component communities along the rural-urban gradient resulted from responses to the availability of particular landscape elements that are compatible with the parasites' life cycles. We found that the replacement of natural environments with buildings breaks up host-parasite interactions, whereas a higher environmental (substrate) diversity allows the survival of a wider range of intermediate hosts and vectors and their associated parasites...|$|R

40|$|We {{applied the}} {{information}} theory concepts to notes repertoire characteristics combined with temporal {{parameters of the}} <b>Rufous-bellied</b> <b>thrush</b> „urdus ru,ventris song, using this particular case to test a new method of analysing quantitatively complex animal communication systems. Like most „urdus thrushes, Rufous-bellied thrushes are remarkable for their long, varied and melodious songs. For {{the analysis of the}} species repertoire, we used recordings of 44 indi-viduals from 24 localities covering its full geographical range. We measured the repertoire size, note duration and rhythm (frequency of note utterance), and combined these parameters with the Shannon entropy values calculated for each individual. Although individuals maintain species-speci"c recognition capacity, we "nd a large variation between their song parameters and show that the information theory can be useful to analyse large and varied animal vocal repertoires.

Little is known of epidemiology of toxoplasmosis in wild birds. In the present study, antibodies to T. gondii were determined in 202 wild birds of 37 species captured in seven small areas of the Atlantic Forest, {{in the state of}} São Paulo, Brazil, and provided information on possible associated risk factors. Antibodies to T. gondii were assayed by the modified agglutination test (MAT) and found in 73 (36. 1 %) of 202 birds with titers of 1 : 5 in 16 samples, 1 : 10 in 26 samples, 1 : 20 in 17 samples, 1 : 40 in 10 samples, 1 : 80 in three samples, and 1 : 160 in one sample. No association was observed between T. gondii seropositivity and the local where the birds were collected. Seropositivity was higher in birds that lived on the forest floor (p < 0. 001; U = 1230. 0), and in omnivorous birds (p = 0. 007; U = 3939. 0). T. gondii antibodies were reported {{for the first time in}} 23 species of birds enlarging the host range of this parasite. Notably, T. gondii antibodies were found in 83. 3 % (15 / 18) of the <b>Rufous-bellied</b> <b>Thrush</b> (Turdus rufiventris) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{data set}} {{provided}} here includes 8, 320 frugivory interactions (records of pairwise interactions between plant and frugivore species) {{reported for the}} Atlantic Forest. The data set includes interactions between 331 vertebrate species (232 birds, 90 mammals, 5 fishes, 1 amphibian, and 3 reptiles) and 788 plant species. We also present information on traits {{directly related to the}} frugivory process (endozoochory), such as the size of fruits and seeds and the body mass and gape size of frugivores. Data were extracted from 166 published and unpublished sources spanning from 1961 to 2016. While this is probably the most comprehensive data set available for a tropical ecosystem, it is arguably taxonomically and geographically biased. The plant families better represented are Melastomataceae, Myrtaceae, Moraceae, Urticaceae, and Solanaceae. Myrsine coriacea, Alchornea glandulosa, Cecropia pachystachya, and Trema micrantha are the plant species with the most animal dispersers (83, 76, 76, and 74 species, respectively). Among the animal taxa, the highest number of interactions is reported for birds (3, 883) followed by mammals (1, 315). The woolly spider monkey or muriqui, Brachyteles arachnoides, and <b>Rufous-bellied</b> <b>Thrush,</b> Turdus rufiventris, are the frugivores with the most diverse fruit diets (137 and 121 plants species, respectively). The most important general patterns that we note are that larger seeded plant species (> 12 mm) are mainly eaten by terrestrial mammals (rodents, ungulates, primates, and carnivores) and that birds are the main consumers of fruits with a high concentration of lipids. Our data set is geographically biased, with most interactions recorded for the southeast Atlantic Forest. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{wild and}} {{domestic}} birds, cryptosporidiosis is {{often associated with}} infections by Cryptosporidium galli, Cryptosporidium baileyi and Cryptosporidium meleagridis. In addition to these species, a number of avian Cryptosporidium species yet to be fully characterized are commonly found among exotic and wild avian isolates. The present study aimed to detect and identify samples of Cryptosporidium spp. from free-living wild birds, in order to contribute to the knowledge of the variability of this parasite in the free-living population of Brazil. Stool samples were collected from 242 birds, with the following proportions of individuals: 50 Emberizidae (20. 7 %), 112 Psittacidae (46. 3 %), 44 Cardinalidae (18. 2 %), 12 Turdidae (5. 0 %), eight Ramphastidae (3. 3 %), seven Icteridae (2. 9 %), three Estrilididae (1. 2 %), two Contigidae (0. 8 %), two Thraupidae (0. 8 %) and two Fringilidae (0. 8 %). Among the 242 fecal samples from wild birds, 16 (6. 6 %) were positive for the presence of oocysts of Cryptosporidium. Molecular characterization of the 16 samples of Cryptosporidium, were performed with phylogenetic reconstructions employing 292 positions of 18 S rDNA. None of the samples of birds was characterized as C. meleagridis. C. galli was identified in one <b>rufous-bellied</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus rufiventris), five green-winged saltators (Saltator similis), one slate-coloured seedeater (Sporophila schistacea), one goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) and three saffron finches (Sicalis flaveola). One goldfinch isolate, one buffy-fronted seedeater (Sporophila frontalis), one red-cowled cardinal (Paroaria dominicana) and one other saffron finch (S. flaveola) were identified as C. baileyi. Avian genotype II was found in an isolate from a white-eyed parakeet (Aratinga leucophthalma). Clinical symptoms of cryptosporidiosis in birds have already been described and the number of wild birds which were shedding parasites was high.
