50|$|In March 1993 an {{inspection}} noticed seepage {{on the north}} wall and it was agreed to stop deposition into compartment 4A. According to the contractor the freeboard at this time was an acceptable 1.0+ m. The division of compartments 4A and 4B was breached some time before the disaster, resulting in drainage from 4B to 4A. The extra drainage led to a freeboard of 300 mm. Despite the termination of daywall construction, deposition of excess plant water containing tailings continued, with the water decanted by the penstock and the remaining tailings using up the <b>remaining</b> <b>freeboard.</b>|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic model {{tests at}} {{a scale of}} 1 : 10 are carried out in a 40 m x 25 m wave basin with a {{state-of-the-art}} 3 D wave generator in order to collect wave overtopping data at vertical walls and dykes with topped vertical walls. Wave conditions in the near field of the structures, velocities under waves and the mean overtopping discharge are measured. The experiments have been commissioned by the Lower Saxony Water Management, Coastal Defense and Nature Conservation Agency (NLWKN) with the purpose to deliver essential overtopping data for validation of numerical models. Two main geometries are analyzed – each for two specific wave spectra. Overtopping rates are investigated {{with respect to the}} <b>remaining</b> <b>freeboard</b> height Rc and the influence of oblique wave attack β{ 0 °, 10 °, 30 °, 40 °, 50 °, 60 °}. Results are compared with existing analytical approaches. As expected for this special geometrical coastal protection structure, it is examined that overtopping discharges increase with decreasing <b>remaining</b> <b>freeboard.</b> Intensity of the reduction is more dependent on the wave spectra than on the dyke geometry. Mean wave overtopping rate increases with decreasing relative water depth Hm 0 /d {{directly in front of the}} vertical wall. Furthermore, the mean wave overtopping rates decrease with an increasing angle of wave attack β. The correlation between mean wave overtopping rate and freeboard height is given in four newly adapted design formulas, describing the overtopping performance of the two discussed dyke geometries with topped vertical walls...|$|E
50|$|On 17 February 1783, the two-decker HMS Argo {{found herself}} unable {{to use her}} lower battery when two French frigates intercepted her. Similarly, during the Action of 13 January 1797, the French 74-gun ship of the line Droits de l'Homme fought the British frigates Indefatigable and Amazon in a sea so heavy {{that she had to}} seal her lower battery, leaving her with only 30 18-pounder guns, which {{effectively}} reduced her to the fighting qualities of a frigate; the British frigates, with their higher <b>freeboard,</b> <b>remained</b> free to use their full potential, and eventually forced the 74-gun to beach herself, even though they would not have been a match for a ship of the line in normal conditions.|$|R
40|$|International audienceShort-term and decadal sea-ice {{prediction}} systems need {{a realistic}} initial state, generally obtained using ice-ocean model simulations with data assimilation. However, only sea-ice concentration and velocity data are currently assimilated. In this work, an ensemble Kalman filter system {{is used to}} assimilate observed ice concentration and freeboard (i. e. thickness of emerged) data into a global coupled ocean-sea-ice model. The impact and effectiveness of our data assimilation system is assessed in two steps: firstly, {{through the use of}} synthetic data (i. e. model-generated data), and secondly, through the assimilation of real satellite data. While ice concentrations are available daily, freeboard data used in this study are only available during six one-month periods spread over 2005 - 2007. Our results show that the simulated Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice extents are improved by the assimilation of synthetic ice concentration data. Assimilation of synthetic ice freeboard data improves the simulated sea-ice thickness field. Using real ice concentration data enhances the model realism in both hemispheres. Assimilation of ice concentration data significantly improves the total hemispheric sea-ice extent all year long, especially in summer. Combining the assimilation of ice freeboard and concentration data leads to better ice thickness, but does not further improve the ice extent. Moreover, the improvements in sea-ice thickness due to the assimilation of ice <b>freeboard</b> <b>remain</b> visible well beyond the assimilation periods...|$|R
5000|$|Vitse-admiral Popov was not {{perfectly}} circular {{like the}} earlier ship; {{she had a}} overall length of 126 ft and a beam of 117 ft. Her hull had a draught of 14 ft, but her propellers stuck out well below {{the bottom of the}} hull to a depth of 19 ft. The ship displaced 3600 LT nearly 50% more at full load than did Novgorod although her <b>freeboard</b> <b>remained</b> 18 in. Like the earlier ship the deck curved upwards to the gun barbette in the center, but the barbette was entirely enclosed by a large unarmoured superstructure that included accommodations for an admiral and his staff. She had a crew of 19 officers and 187 ratings. Her bluff hull form meant that she lost speed in heavy weather and, in some conditions, the ship could pitch enough to place her propellers out of the water. The biggest drawback to her hull shape was that it greatly reduced the rudder's ability to turn the ship by masking much of the flow of water. So much so that it took 40-45 minutes to make a full circle and the ship was almost unsteerable in a severe storm. The solution adopted was to use the engines for steering and leave the rudder fixed, even though this reduced the ship's speed. During a Force 7 storm, Vitse-admiral Popovs captain wrote that: [...] "the vessel took on a lot of water through the hatches in front of the ventilators... The steering wheel was torn out of [...] hands, and the vessel did not answer the helm; it was necessary to steer by means of the engines, and to make fast the rudder." ...|$|R
