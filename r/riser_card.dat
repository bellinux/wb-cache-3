25|$|Apple {{encouraged}} hardware {{developers to}} produce PCI compatible peripherals {{that could be}} added to the Pippin. The only official method of producing add-ons for the Pippin was by developing PCI-compatible devices, and then placed in a docking station cabinet. A proprietary <b>riser</b> <b>card</b> interface (referred to by Apple as an X-PCI slot) is located on the bottom of a Pippin system, and is used by docking stations. A docking station for a Pippin can contain a variety of hardware, such as SCSI or floppy disk drive controllers, video interfaces, codecs, or network interfaces such as Ethernet. The logic board passes PCI signals through the X-PCI docking interface, and then to the docking station. Docking stations within the Pippin line do not provide pass-through support, thereby limiting a Pippin system to use only one docking station at one time. For example, a docking station for a floppy disk drive would need to be removed in order to attach a docking station for the magneto optical drive. Katz Media produced a generic docking station, containing a PCI slot, allowing a user to install PCI cards. No PCI-based peripherals were ever developed specifically for the Pippin.|$|E

50|$|The {{design has}} {{provision}} for one expansion slot. Earlier motherboards conventionally have a standard 33 MHz 5V 32-bit PCI slot. Many older case designs use <b>riser</b> <b>cards</b> {{and some even}} have two-slot <b>riser</b> <b>cards,</b> although the two-slot <b>riser</b> <b>cards</b> are not compatible with all boards. Some boards based around non-x86 processors have a 3.3V PCI slot, and the Mini-ITX 2.0 (2008) boards have a PCI-Express ×16 slot; these boards are not compatible with the standard PCI <b>riser</b> <b>cards</b> supplied with older ITX cases.|$|R
50|$|Integrated audio is {{implemented}} with the AC'97 Codec on the motherboard, a Communications and Networking <b>Riser</b> (CNR) <b>card,</b> or an audio/modem <b>riser</b> (AMR) <b>card.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Riser</b> <b>cards</b> {{are often}} used to allow adding {{expansion}} cards to a system enclosed in a low-profile case where {{the height of the}} case does not allow for a perpendicular placement of the full-height expansion card.|$|R
50|$|The IMPACT boards {{draw more}} power than the GIO-64 bus can deliver, so IMPACT-ready systems have {{additional}} power connectors on the expansion <b>riser</b> <b>card,</b> with a separate connection to the power supply. An IMPACT-ready Indigo² must have an IMPACT-ready <b>riser</b> <b>card,</b> an IMPACT-ready power supply, and a sufficiently recent PROM revision. The Indigo2's replacement, the SGI Octane, offered an upgraded XIO bus but featured the same graphics options, albeit in repackaged form.|$|E

While blue SATA cables to hard drives are installed (top edge), hard drives themselves are not included. The available PCI-Express slot (<b>riser</b> <b>card</b> in the middle) is also empty. Includes motherboard, CD-ROM and power supply (bottom). Old PCI slot is still present on the motherboard but requires separately sold <b>riser</b> <b>card</b> to be reachable.|$|E
5000|$|Riser {{cards are}} used in rack-mount server and {{industrial}} computer applications. In 1U and 2U rack-mount computer systems, riser cards are integrated into the system to allow the addition of feature cards in a horizontal position (instead of a standard vertical position). This {{is due to the}} height limitations of a 1U and 2U system which are 1.75" [...] and 3.5" [...] respectively. Typically, a 1U system uses a 1U single slot <b>riser</b> <b>card</b> whereas a 2U system uses a 2U 3 slot <b>riser</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E
50|$|The ACR {{specification}} {{provides a}} lower cost method to connect certain expansion cards to a computer, {{with an emphasis on}} audio and communications devices. Sound cards and modems are the most common devices to use the specification. ACR and other <b>riser</b> <b>cards</b> lower hardware costs by offloading much of the computing tasks of the peripheral to the CPU.|$|R
5000|$|The {{specification}} {{was very}} popular in the early-mid 90's, and briefly displaced the AT form factor as the most commonly used. However, {{the release of the}} Pentium II in 1997 highlighted the flaws of the format, as a good airflow was important in Pentium II systems, owing to the relatively high heat dispersal requirements of the processor. LPX systems suffered a restricted airflow due to the centrally placed <b>riser</b> <b>cards.</b> The introduction of the AGP format further complicated matters, as the design not only increased the pin count on <b>riser</b> <b>cards,</b> but it limited most cards to one AGP, one PCI and one ISA slot, which was too restrictive for most users. Some lower-quality LPX boards didn't even feature a real AGP slot, but simply used a physical AGP slot and connected it to the PCI bus. This was seldom noticed however, as many [...] "AGP" [...] graphics cards of the time were in fact PCI cards internally, and did not take advantage of the features offered by AGP.|$|R
50|$|The Cray XT4 (codenamed Hood during development) is {{an updated}} version of the Cray XT3 supercomputer. It was {{released}} on November 18, 2006. It includes {{an updated version}} of the SeaStar interconnect router called SeaStar2, processor sockets for Socket AM2 Opteron processors, and 240-pin unbuffered DDR2 memory. The XT4 also includes support for FPGA coprocessors that plug into <b>riser</b> <b>cards</b> in the Service and IO blades. The interconnect, cabinet, system software and programming environment remain unchanged from the Cray XT3. It was superseded in 2007 by the Cray XT5.|$|R
50|$|A <b>riser</b> <b>card</b> is {{a printed}} circuit board that picks up a {{multitude}} of signal lines (often bused) via a single connector (usually an edge connector) on a motherboard and distributes them via dedicated connectors on the card.|$|E
5000|$|STS 07 Information Overload is back up {{and running}} {{currently}} 8 lines until we find a 486 without a <b>riser</b> <b>card</b> to support 16 lines if anyone would like to donate one they have that would be greatly appreciated! ...|$|E
50|$|In computing, the {{expansion}} card, expansion board, adapter card or accessory card, is {{a printed circuit}} board that can be inserted into an electrical connector, or expansion slot on a computer motherboard, backplane or <b>riser</b> <b>card</b> to add functionality to a computer system via {{the expansion}} bus.|$|E
5000|$|Daughterboards are {{sometimes}} used in computers {{in order to}} allow for expansion cards to fit parallel to the motherboard, usually to maintain a small form factor. This form are also called <b>riser</b> <b>cards,</b> or <b>risers.</b> Daughterboards are also sometimes used to expand the basic functionality of an electronic device, such as when a certain model has features added to it and is released as a new or separate model. Rather than redesign the first model completely, a daughterboard may be added to a special connector on the main board. These usually fit on top of and parallel to the board, separated by spacers or standoffs, and are therefore sometimes called mezzanine cards due to being stacked like the mezzanine of a theatre. Wavetable cards (sample-based synthesis cards) are often [...] on sound cards in this manner.|$|R
40|$|Multicore {{processors}} {{have been}} effective in scaling application performance by dividing computation among multiple threads running in parallel. However, application performance does not necessarily improve as more cores are added. Application performance can be limited due to multiple bottlenecks including contention for shared resources such as caches and memory. In this paper, we perform a scalability analysis of parallel applications on a 64 -threaded Intel Nehalem-EX based system. We find that applications which scale well on small number of cores, exhibit poor scalability on large number of cores. Using hardware performance counters, we show that many performance limited applications are limited by memory bandwidth on manycore platforms and exhibit improved scalability when provisioned with higher memory bandwidth by varying the number of memory <b>riser</b> <b>cards</b> used. Results show significant energy savings for these memory bandwidth limited applications by regulating the number of threads used and applying dynamic voltage and frequency scaling...|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} Mac Pro's {{main memory}} uses 667MHz DDR2 ECC FB-DIMMs; the early 2008 model uses 800MHz ECC DDR2 FB-DIMMS, the 2009 and onward Mac Pro use 1066MHz DDR3 ECC DIMMs {{for the standard}} models, and 1333MHz DDR3 ECC DIMMs for systems configured with 2.66GHz or faster CPUs. In the original and 2008 models, these modules are installed in pairs, one each on two <b>riser</b> <b>cards.</b> The cards have 4 DIMM slots each, allowing a total of 32GB of memory (8 × 4GB) to be installed. Notably, due to its FB-DIMM architecture, installing more RAM in the Mac Pro will improve its memory bandwidth, but may also increase its memory latency. With a simple installation of a single FB-DIMM, the peak bandwidth is 8GB/s, but this can increase to 16GB/s by installing two FB-DIMMs, one {{on each of the}} two buses, which is the default configuration from Apple. While electrically the FB-DIMMs are standard, for pre-2009 Mac Pro models Apple specifies larger-than-normal heatsinks on the memory modules. Problems have been reported by users who have used third party RAM with normal size FB-DIMM heatsinks. (see notes below). 2009 and later Mac Pro computers do not require memory modules with heatsinks.|$|R
50|$|A <b>riser</b> <b>card</b> is a {{board that}} plugs {{into the system}} board and {{provides}} additional slots for adapter cards. Because it rises above the system board, it enables you to connect additional adapters to the system in an orientation that {{is parallel to the}} system board and save space within the system case.|$|E
5000|$|The Indigo², code named Fullhouse, was {{a desktop}} workstation. The Challenge M was a server which {{differed}} from the Indigo² only by a slightly differently colored and badged case, {{and the absence of}} graphics and sound hardware. Both systems were based on the MIPS processors. Both systems supported EISA bus and SGI proprietary GIO64 expansion bus via a <b>riser</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Pico BTX is a {{motherboard}} {{form factor}} that {{is meant to}} miniaturize the 12.8 xx 10.5 in BTX standard. Pico BTX motherboards measure 8 xx 10.5 in. This is smaller than many current [...] "micro"-sized motherboards, hence the name [...] "pico". These motherboards share a common top half with the other sizes in the BTX line, but support {{only one or two}} expansion slots, designed for half-height or <b>riser</b> <b>card</b> applications.|$|E

50|$|The {{motherboard}} {{includes a}} 16 bit ISA slot {{connected to a}} <b>riser</b> <b>card,</b> providing a total of two 16 bit ISA slots. One of these slots is populated with an ISA card, which provides connections for sound {{at the rear of}} the machine and a connection for the Mega Drive cartridge at the front. The other slot was left free for expansion (such as the addition of a modem or Network Interface Card).|$|E
5000|$|There {{was never}} any {{official}} LPX specification, but the design normally featured a 13 xx 9 in motherboard with the main I/O ports mounted on the back (something that was later adopted by the ATX form factor), and a <b>riser</b> <b>card</b> {{in the center of}} the motherboard, on which the PCI and ISA slots were mounted. Due to the lack of standardized specification, riser cards were seldom compatible from one motherboard design to another, much less one manufacturer to another. The internal PSU connector was of the same type used in the AT form factor.|$|E
50|$|NLX (New Low Profile eXtended) was a {{form factor}} {{proposed}} by Intel and developed jointly with IBM, DEC, and other vendors for low profile, low cost, mass-marketed retail PCs. Release 1.2 was finalized in March 1997 and release 1.8 was finalized in April 1999. NLX was similar in overall design to LPX, including a <b>riser</b> <b>card</b> and a low-profile slimline case. It was modernized and updated to allow support for the latest technologies while keeping costs down and fixing the main problems with LPX. It specified motherboards from 10 xx 8 in to 13.6 xx 9 in in size.|$|E
5000|$|The PS/2E {{featured}} a 486SLC2 50/25MHz with 16 kilobytes of L1 cache allowing the CPU to execute instructions {{at twice the}} 25MHz bus speed while required instructions and data reside in the cache. No external L2 cache was designed on the motherboard however; so the machine relies on its 16 KB of L1 cache for performance. With an ISA bus, it accepts a single ISA option adapter {{with the use of}} a <b>riser</b> <b>card.</b> Depending on the sub-model number, it came supplied with either a special option adapter for four PC card PCMCIA slots, or as a diskless workstation with an ethernet or token-ring adapter. [...] Additional options included several PCMCIA cards, a color LCD screen, and a color LCD touch-screen with a special version of OS/2.|$|E
5000|$|The new {{navy blue}} grid {{version of the}} Prevue Channel {{software}} was as crash-prone as previous ones. Flashing red Amiga [...] "guru meditation" [...] errors (with the raw satellite feed's dual promo windows and national satellite listings grid showing through from behind them) remained a frequent sight on many cable systems throughout the United States and Canada. While Prevue Networks' software engineers released regular patches to correct bugs, it simultaneously became clear that an entirely new hardware platform would soon be needed. New Amiga 2000 hardware was no longer being manufactured by Commodore, which filed for bankruptcy in 1994, and Prevue Networks began resorting to cannibalizing parts from second-hand dealers of used Amiga hardware {{in order to continue}} supplying and maintaining operational units. During periods where Amiga 2000 hardware availability proved insufficient, newer models such as the Amiga 3000 were used instead. However, as those models' stock cases would not accept the company's large existing inventory of Zephyrus ISA demodulator cards, only their motherboards were used, in custom-designed cases with <b>riser</b> <b>card</b> and backplane modifications.|$|E
