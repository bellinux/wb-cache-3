Dwight, upon overhearing that Phillip has been eating the type of paper which he himself regards as the most flavorful, begins to think that Angela's son is actually his. To test this theory, Dwight offers the child either a check for one million dollars or a beet; Phillip picks the beet.

However, much {{of what has been}} done in this regard falls drastically short. Leadership development has been too vague, outdated and theoretical. It has rarely been tied to an organisation’s immediate needs, nor has it adequately prepared leaders for the challenges of the future. An approach to leadership development programmes that combines theoretical concepts with opportunities to apply observable behaviours is required. The 21 st century demands a new kind of leader with relevant skills. Action learning is effective in developing leaders because it is adaptable and flexible. In this investigation, 58 Regional Development Officers were asked to rate the leadership styles of <b>Regional</b> Development <b>Managers</b> on the Leadership Style Inventory (LSI). In turn, 18 <b>Regional</b> Development <b>Managers</b> were asked to report on the same questionnaire their own leadership styles. According to Regional Development Officers, the two leadership styles mostly displayed by <b>Regional</b> Development <b>Managers</b> (according to behavioural rating) are the coaching and democratic styles. <b>Regional</b> Development <b>Managers</b> deemed the affiliative and democratic styles to be the mostly used. The findings of this study, together with relevant literature, are used to propose a Leadership Styles Competency Framework for Governing Bodies in Sport. [URL]...|$|R
