25|$|Seals {{are still}} used for {{official}} purposes {{in a number}} of contexts. When collecting parcels or <b>registered</b> <b>post,</b> the name seal serves as an identification, akin to a signature. In banks, traditionally the method of identification was also by a seal. Seals remain the customary form of identification on cheques in mainland China and Taiwan but not in Hong Kong where signatures are required. Today, personal identification is often by a hand signature accompanied by a seal imprint. Seals can serve as identification with signatures because they are difficult to forge (when compared to forging a signature) and only the owner has access to his own seal.|$|E
500|$|The Victoria Cross {{is awarded}} for [...] A {{recommendation}} for the VC is normally issued by an officer at regimental level, or equivalent, {{and has to}} be supported by three witnesses, although this has been waived on occasion. The recommendation is then passed up the military hierarchy until it reaches the Secretary of State for Defence. The recommendation is then laid before the monarch who approves the award with his or her signature. Victoria Cross awards are always promulgated in the London Gazette with the single exception of the award to the American Unknown Soldier in 1921. The Victoria Cross warrant makes no specific provision as to who should actually present the medals to the recipients. Queen Victoria indicated that she would like to present the medals in person and she presented 185 medals out of the 472 gazetted during her reign. Including the first 62 medals presented at a parade in Hyde Park on 26 June 1857 by Queen Victoria, nearly 900 awards have been personally presented to the recipient by the reigning British monarch. Nearly 300 awards have been presented {{by a member of the}} royal family or by a civil or military dignitary. About 150 awards were either forwarded to the recipient or next of kin by <b>registered</b> <b>post</b> or no details of the presentations are known.|$|E
