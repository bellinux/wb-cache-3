50|$|A new CAT {{contract}} {{was signed in}} 1957, and Bruce Blevins flew a C-47 to Vientiane, to service the US Embassy. When he flew elsewhere in the country, conditions were technologically underdeveloped; Vientiane had the only control tower, <b>radio</b> <b>navigational</b> aid, and non-dirt runway in Laos. The US, again covertly, increased its level of support.|$|R

5000|$|These charts {{are similar}} to {{sectional}} charts, and the symbols are the same. However, there is less detail at the smaller scale, so it is seldom used for visual flight rules flight at slower speeds or for local flights. WACs show topographic information, airports and <b>radio</b> <b>navigational</b> aids. They are useful for strategic flight planning, where {{a view of the}} entire flight area is useful.|$|R
2500|$|Four {{different}} {{brands of}} marketed <b>navigational</b> <b>receivers</b> that use data from GPS or Galileo {{along with the}} Chinese BeiDou satellites, and even some receivers that use BeiDou satellites alone, were found to implement leap seconds one day early. [...] This was traced {{to the fact that}} BeiDou numbers the days of the week from 0 to 6, while GPS and Galileo number them from 1 to 7. The problem was found to exist in commercial simulators that are used by manufacturers to test their equipment.|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} develop {{international}} regulation for the frangibility of equipment or installations at airports, required for air navigation purposes (e.g., approach lighting towers, meteorological equipment, <b>radio</b> <b>navigational</b> aids) and their support structures, ICAO initiated the [...] "Frangible Aids Study Group" [...] in 1981, with the task to define design requirements, design guidelines and test procedures. This work has resulted in part 6 of the Aerodrome Design Manual, dedicated to frangibility.|$|R

5000|$|Brockway Glass Corporation, {{headquartered}} in nearby Brockway, Pennsylvania, built a corporate hangar for their aircraft (and later a commuter airline service), and Fixed-Base Operator Beechwoods Flying Service built general aviation [...] "T hangars", fuel pumps and maintenance hangars. The FAA opened a Flight Service Station in 1963 to provide weather and aviation advisory service to pilots, which is noted for rapidly changing and severe weather. In the 1970s the FAA located a regional <b>radio</b> <b>navigational</b> maintenance facility on the field.|$|R
5000|$|While the NTSB {{agreed that}} Ferguson's actions were not deliberate, his appeal was {{rejected}} {{when the court}} decided his actions were reckless and in violation of a key FAR (§ 91.5) that required a pilot to familiarize himself or herself with all available flight information, and a company policy (Western Airlines Flight Operation Manual, P 5.3.3.C) that required him to use a <b>radio</b> <b>navigational</b> instrument to identify the airport before landing. Ferguson claimed he [...] "saw the runway and assumed {{it was the right}} airport".|$|R

50|$|A {{significant}} and recurring operational criticism of Sofia Airport has concerned its historical lack of all-weather operations capability. Though the new runway {{was designed for}} ICAO Category 3 operations, in 2007 it emerged that radio interference from security fencing, and most significantly from a large newly built lorry park, prevented certification (and hence use) of the associated <b>radio</b> <b>navigational</b> aids. During the winter months, the airport, located on a high alluvial plain surrounded by mountains, suffers from very {{significant and}} frequent fog precipitation. In such circumstances, flights are redirected to diversion airports in Bulgaria or neighbouring countries, lengthening journeys by many hours.|$|R
50|$|A {{most basic}} {{aviation}} <b>radio</b> <b>navigational</b> aid is the NDB or Non-directional Beacon. These are simple low frequency and medium frequency transmitters {{and they are}} used to locate airways intersections, airports and to conduct instrument approaches, {{with the use of a}} radio direction finder located on the aircraft. The aviation NDBs, especially the ones marking airways intersections, are gradually decommissioned, as they are replaced with other navigational aids based on newer technologies. Due to relatively low purchase, maintenance and calibration cost, they are still used to mark locations of smaller aerodromes and important helicopter landing sites.|$|R
50|$|As {{a member}} of a Resistance group during the Second World War he flew to the UK in a small plane as part of a {{dangerous}} mission, and was able to provide British intelligence with invaluable information. There he met up with Charles de Gaulle who named him Director of Research in the Forces navales françaises libres (the Navy of Free France). He became particularly interested in the detection of solar radio emissions by British Radar, which were causing military problems by jamming detection during periods of high emission, and was able to create a new <b>radio</b> <b>navigational</b> beam station.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s the City of DuBois created a Municipal Airport Authority which looked into means of {{expanding}} the existing DuBois City Airport, in the Oklahoma section, {{east of the}} city. They determined that site was unsuitable for expansion and joined with Jefferson County officials to procure the present site, 6 mi northwest of DuBois. Construction was completed and the first flight was made on June 1, 1960 by Allegheny Airlines. In the 1960s and 1970s <b>radio</b> <b>navigational</b> aids were added, including a non-directional beacon (DU), and finally an Instrument Landing System (ILS) for runway 25 (IDUJ).|$|R
5000|$|The U.S. {{plan has}} been {{implemented}} once (other than tests) since its inception, and even then, it was a modified version. On September 11, 2001, the codeword was broadcast ordering that all U.S. air traffic be grounded, after the September 11 attacks. [...] Even in that instance, the emergency plan was only partially implemented as the Defense Department left command {{and control of the}} air traffic system with the FAA and intentionally allowed all <b>radio</b> <b>navigational</b> aids to remain in operation to aid in the process of controlling and landing the thousands of planes which were aloft in domestic airspace.|$|R
40|$|A {{configuration}} {{has been}} developed for a long-life balloon platform to carry pointing telescopes weighing as much as 80 pounds (36 kg) to point at selected celestial targets. A platform of this configuration weighs about 375 pounds (170 kg) gross and can be suspended from a high altitude super pressure balloon {{for a lifetime of}} several months. The balloon platform contains a solar array and storage batteries for electrical power, up and down link communications equipment, and navigational and attitude control systems for orienting the scientific instrument. A biaxial controller maintains the telescope attitude in response to look-angle data stored in an on-board computer memory which is updated periodically by ground command. Gimbal angles are computed by using location data derived by an on-board <b>navigational</b> <b>receiver...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Lancaster B I {{was never}} fully {{superseded}} in production by a successor model, remaining in production until February 1946. According to aviation authors Brian Goulding and M. Garbett, the Lancaster B I altered little during its production life, partially {{as a result}} of the sound basic structure and design; of the visible changes, the fuselage side-windows were deleted, the Perspex chin of the bomb-aimer was enlarged, and a larger astrodome was provisioned. Various additional bumps and blisters were also added, which would typically house radar equipment and <b>radio</b> <b>navigational</b> aids. Some Lancaster B I bombers were outfitted with bulged bomb bay doors in order to accommodate increased armament payloads.|$|R
2500|$|The sky {{was dark}} and the pilots lacked any visual ground references. Descent was {{controlled}} {{through the use of}} the vertical-speed wheel of the autopilot, combined with an altitude preselect (which illuminated a light when reaching preselected altitudes) in manual mode. While retaining use of the autopilot, the pilots reduced their speed to [...] at the request of air-traffic control at 19:07. At this point the pilots were working through the approach checklist. The captain halted the checklist at the point regarding the radio altimeter, as the aircraft was above its operational limit, and he wanted to control the plane's operation during further descent. At 19:11, the aircraft received permission to bear 180 degrees and descend to and maintain 1,000 meters (3,000ft) of altitude. Both <b>navigational</b> <b>receivers</b> were tuned to the ILS frequency.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Global Positioning System (GPS), the transmitted navigational signal, {{and the overall}} acquisition approach are explained. <b>Navigational</b> <b>receiver</b> components are functionally described and the hierarchy of platform integration and capability is discussed. Specifically explored is the integration of GPS into the Sikorsky SH- 3 Helicopter Performance comparisons of the medium versus high dynamic receiver, based solely on preliminary simulation data, indicate {{that at this time}} the medium dynamic receiver is the optimum configuration. Elimination of the doppler radar in lieu of the five channel receiver would only be possible after thorough over-water testing of the high dynamic set. The actual velocity accuracy of GPS receivers in a hovering helicopter is the main question yet to be answered. The overall mission effectiveness of the GPS equipped SH- 3 Helicopter should be significantly improved because of an accurate, stand-alone navigation system. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
