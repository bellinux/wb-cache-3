5|$|A {{report by}} an amateur <b>radio</b> <b>operator</b> {{who claimed to}} have {{received}} a faint SOS signal from Star Dust initially raised hopes that there might have been survivors, but all subsequent attempts over the years to find the vanished flight failed. In the absence of any hard evidence, numerous theories arose —including rumours of sabotage (compounded by the later disappearance of two other aircraft also belonging to British South American Airways); speculation that the flight might have been blown up to destroy diplomatic documents being carried by passenger Paul Simpson; or even the suggestion that Star Dust might have been taken or destroyed by a UFO (an idea fuelled by unresolved questions about the flight's final Morse code message).|$|E

25|$|Amateur <b>radio</b> <b>operators</b> {{have played}} a {{significant}} part in disaster management and emergencies. In 1991, during the Gulf War, a lone Indian ham operator in Kuwait, provided {{the only means of}} communication between stranded Indian nationals in that country and their relatives in India. Amateur <b>radio</b> <b>operators</b> have also played a helpful part in disaster management. Shortly after the 1993 Latur and 2001 Gujarat earthquakes, the central government rushed teams of ham <b>radio</b> <b>operators</b> to the epicentre to provide vital communication links. In December 2004, a group of amateur <b>radio</b> <b>operators</b> on DX-pedition on the Andaman Islands witnessed the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. With communication lines between the islands severed, the group provided the only way of relaying live updates and messages to stations across the world.|$|R
5|$|At 09:15, {{two more}} ships {{appeared}} on the scene– Mount Temple and Californian, which had finally learned of the disaster when her <b>radio</b> <b>operator</b> returned to duty– but by then {{there were no more}} survivors to be rescued. Carpathia had been bound for Fiume, Austria-Hungary (now Rijeka, Croatia), but as she had neither the stores nor the medical facilities to cater for the survivors, Rostron ordered that a course be calculated to return the ship to New York, where the survivors could be properly looked after. Carpathia departed the area, leaving the other ships to carry out a final, fruitless, two-hour search.|$|E
