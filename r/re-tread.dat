Therefore, local rubber industries, particularly <b>re-treading</b> tyre industry has started replacing RSS grade partly with a cheaper scrap grade of Natural Rubber (NR) in their <b>re-treading</b> tyre compounds, in arbitrary ratios without considering the quality of tyre treads. In the project work, the tyre <b>re-treading</b> compounds based on blends of (RSS) and scrap grade in different proportions are investigated to identify the most suitable blend for obtaining optimum technical properties. The first step of the study reveals that the blend having RSS and scrap rubber in the ratio 80 : 20 is the most suitable economical blend to obtain a balance of technical properties. To get the optimum technical properties of the <b>re-treading</b> tyre compounds, {{the amount of carbon}} black should be added separately into the two types of rubber and prepared in the form of master batches, prior to mixing the two types of rubber together. Different weight. ratios are used for the two portions and correspondingly different compounds are prepared. The second step of the project work reveals that the addition of carbon black-oil mix should be made separately into each grade of rubber (of the chosen formulation from the first step of the project work), preferably 80 % by weight t~ RSS and 20 % by weight to scrap rubber, for optimum quality tyre treads Further increase of carbon black in scrap rubber is observed to give deleterious effects on both, cure and vulcanisate properties, due to non uniform dispersion of carbon black in scrap, possibly due to higher loading of carbon black in scrap rubbe...|$|R

40|$|The re-invention {{of human}} error 2 This paper {{contrasts}} the {{new view of}} human error with {{what is known as}} the old view, and examines the implications for progress on aerospace safety. In the old view, systems are basically safe, and it is human error that causes most accidents. The new view sees systems as not basically safe, and human errors are symptoms of contradictions, pressures and resource limitations deeper inside the system. By looking critically at two common methods for classifying human errors in aerospace, the paper traces ways in which attempts to introduce the new view become re-inventions of the old view of human error. This happens when we assume that (1) we can meaningfully count errors and assign them to categories, that classification is the same as analysis; (2) human error is caused by inherent processing limitations or motivational shortcomings; (3) judgments, for example of "people losing situation awareness " under fashionable guises can double as explanations of human error; and (4) we should seek sources of failure higher up, away from the local sharp end operators, by locating blame elsewhere in an organization. These error classification systems <b>re-tread</b> the old view around the wheels of supposed progress on safety, reinforcing the biases we already suffer when dealing with failure. In reality, progress on safety can be made by understanding how people create safety, and by understanding how the creation of safety can break down in resource-limited systems that pursue multiple competing goals. The paper argues for abandoning the construction of cause and instead deepening our insights into patterns of failure; the mechanisms by which failure succeeds...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{teaching}} technology provides Applied Mechanics {{students with}} the freedom and flexibility to independently learn outside of the lecture theatre at their own convenience. Learning Management Systems (LMS), which have evolved through the needs of distance education and online education provision, now also offer a powerful means to add additional value to face-to-face education. When used appropriately and effectively, these systems {{have the potential to}} create an extremely broad and rich, blended learning experience of multi-modal delivery. However, in response to the pioneers who have demonstrated these possibilities, students are now increasingly insisting that all of their course material should be readily available online. Universities are responding to these market demands by persuading academics to embrace e-learning tools, particularly with respect to the recording of lectures. Consequently, it is of little surprise that there is now an arsenal of bemusing technologically complex systems, that lecturers can now choose from, in order to rise to this challenge and broadcast, or publish online. Nonetheless, it cannot be claimed that all lecturers employ the use of this new technology with the same level of enthusiasm as the students, nor perhaps are able to effectively meet their expectations en mass. But why? This paper addresses two hypotheses that seem apparent during a transition from traditional lecturing methods to multi-modal delivery: A lack of opportunity to embrace the technology and a fear that online material will prevent students from attending lectures; the latter of which is often fiercely debated. The use of new lecture theatre technology, which assists in the creation of online multi-modal delivery, is often led by innovative academics, rather than through the strategic leadership of an institution, and it is these individuals who become the 'beta testers', that overcome the difficulties of operation, amidst a highly stressful work environment. Those that choose to follow must <b>re-tread</b> these same pathways amidst the same handicaps, which is not conducive to widespread, nor consistent usage. Amidst an institutional culture that simply insists upon recorded lectures, students might assume that it is generally safe not to attend lectures, and in such cases academics that fear that lecture attendance will decline are correct. However, a strategically determined blend of multi-modal deliveries, in a blended learning environment, in which e-learning material obviously compliments lecture attendance, will result in a far deeper, broader and hence richer learning experience for the student. The authors conclude that teaching staff will require more direct support in establishing a richer e-learning culture, if this is to strategically and effectively blend with face to face learning opportunities. Lecture attendance may fall, but this should only occur if it does not matter. If lecture attendance remains important, then students must see additional value in attending, rather than perceive it as simply a repeated opportunity to view what is online.
