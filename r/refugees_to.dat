5|$|The American {{government}} saw {{the evacuation}} {{as an opportunity}} to weaken the communists by providing for and thereby winning the loyalty of the <b>refugees</b> <b>to</b> the anti-communist cause. The United States Operation Mission proposed that aside from helping to evacuate <b>refugees</b> <b>to</b> the south and thereby draining the communist population base, the Americans should provide healthcare, shelter, food and clothing in order to help the anti-communists win the fidelity of their compatriots. Another benefit of participating in the evacuation was that American personnel would be on the ground in North Vietnam, allowing them to gather intelligence on communist activities.|$|E

5|$|Although Operation Backstop {{was within}} the UNPROFOR mandate (since the peacekeepers were {{authorised}} {{to use force to}} prevent armed incursions into the UNPAs), Croatian authorities resented the operation. Croatia considered the UNPROFOR overzealous in defending the UNPAs and protecting the Serbs while failing to ensure the fulfilment of other aspects of the Vance plan, such as the return of <b>refugees</b> <b>to</b> their homes.|$|E

5|$|Author Robert R. Frump {{wrote in}} The Man-eaters of Eden that Mozambican {{refugees}} regularly crossing Kruger National Park {{at night in}} South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may {{have been killed in}} the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the <b>refugees</b> <b>to</b> cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the NRA {{captured}} Kampala with a {{force of}} 14,000 soldiers, including 500 Rwandans, and formed a new government. After Museveni was inaugurated as president, he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army. The experience of the Bush War inspired Rwigyema and Kagame to consider an attack against Rwanda, {{with the goal of}} allowing the <b>refugees</b> <b>to</b> return home. In addition to fulfilling their army duties, the pair began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army's ranks, intended as the nucleus for such an attack. With the pro-refugee Museveni in power, RANU was able to move back to Kampala. At its 1987 convention, it renamed itself to the Rwandan Patriotic Front, and it too committed to returning the <b>refugees</b> <b>to</b> Rwanda by any means possible. In 1988, a leadership crisis within the RPF prompted Fred Rwigyema to intervene in the organisation and take control, replacing Peter Bayingana as RPF president. Kagame and other senior members of Rwigyema's Rwandan entourage within the NRA also joined, with Kagame assuming the vice-presidency. Bayingana remained as the other vice-president, but resented the loss of the leadership.|$|E
5|$|In January, 1951, {{the student}} body of the Presbyterian McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago {{sponsored}} Béla, Eva, Tibor and Robert Banathy as <b>refugees</b> <b>to</b> the United States. Bánáthy lived with his family at the Seminary, where he worked nights 60 hours a week shoveling coal to fire the Seminary furnace. At the same time, he was studying English from a book. He occasionally preached at nearby Hungarian churches. His wife found work as a machine operator and Tibor, their third son, entered American public school.|$|E

5|$|Kagame and Rwigyema {{joined the}} NRA {{primarily}} to ease conditions for Rwandan refugees persecuted by Obote. They {{also had a}} long-term goal of returning with other Tutsi <b>refugees</b> <b>to</b> Rwanda; military experience {{would enable them to}} fight the Hutu-dominated Rwandan army. In the NRA, Kagame specialized in intelligence-gathering, and he rose to a position close to Museveni's. The NRA, based in the Luwero Triangle, fought the Ugandan army for the next five years, even after Obote was deposed in a 1985 coup d'état and the start of peace talks.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} concerns facing the government in exile in 1940 was the situation of Belgian refugees in the United Kingdom. By 1940, at least 15,000 Belgian civilians {{had arrived in the}} United Kingdom, many of them without their possessions. The refugees had originally been dealt with by the British government, however in September 1940, the government established a Central Service of <b>Refugees</b> <b>to</b> provide material assistance and employment for Belgians in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Operation Sana, {{along with}} the near-concurrent Operation Maestral 2, created {{a large number of}} Serb {{refugees}} from the areas previously controlled by the VRS. Bosnian Serb sources document approximately 40,000 refugees in September 1995, encompassing the entire contemporary Bosnian Serb populations of the towns of Jajce, Šipovo, Mrkonjić Grad and Donji Vakuf having fled or been evacuated. At the time, the UN spokesman in Sarajevo estimated the number of refugees at 20,000. Fighting in October caused a further 30,000–40,000 <b>refugees</b> <b>to</b> flee Sanski Most and another 10,000 to flee Mrkonjić Grad and its surroundings.|$|E

50|$|It is {{the very}} nature of a <b>refugee</b> <b>to</b> be displaced. Very few {{refugees}} resettle in new countries either close <b>to</b> the <b>refugee’s</b> home country or as far away as America. A <b>refugee’s</b> adaptation <b>to</b> his/her new home is dependent on many factors including education, sex, age, size of residence, ethnicity, ethnic support network, sponsorship, voyage trauma, marital status, length of residence, {{and in the case of}} <b>refugees</b> moving <b>to</b> America or other English speaking countries, English proficiency. While resettlement is hard on all refugees, children often have an especially hard time adapting to their new surroundings.|$|R
5|$|The Kite Runner is {{the first}} novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. Published in 2003 by Riverhead Books, it {{tells the story of}} Amir, a young boy from the Wazir Akbar Khan {{district}} of Kabul, whose closest friend is Hassan.

5|$|Alboin moved west in his march, invading {{the region}} of Liguria (north-west Italy) and {{reaching}} its capital Mediolanum (Milan) on September 3, 569, only to find it already abandoned by the vicarius Italiae (vicar of Italy), the authority entrusted with {{the administration of the}} diocese of Annonarian Italy. Archbishop Honoratus, his clergy, and part of the laity accompanied the vicarius Italiae to find a safe haven in the Byzantine port of Genua (Genoa). Alboin counted the years of his reign from the capture of Milan, when he assumed the title of dominus Italiae (Lord of Italy). His success also meant the collapse of Byzantine defences {{in the northern part of}} the Po plain, and large movements of <b>refugees</b> <b>to</b> Byzantine areas.|$|E
5|$|By late 1996, Hutu militants {{from the}} camps were {{launching}} regular cross-border incursions, and the RPF-led Rwandan government launched a counteroffensive. Rwanda provided troops and military training to the Banyamulenge, a Tutsi {{group in the}} Zairian South Kivu province, helping them to defeat Zairian security forces. Rwandan forces, the Banyamulenge, and other Zairian Tutsi, then attacked the refugee camps, targeting the Hutu militia. These attacks caused {{hundreds of thousands of}} <b>refugees</b> <b>to</b> flee; many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF, while others ventured further west into Zaire. The defeated forces of the former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign, supported initially by the predominantly Hutu population of Rwanda's north western provinces. By 1999, a programme of propaganda and Hutu integration into the national army succeeded in bringing the Hutu to the government side and the insurgency was defeated.|$|E

5|$|Diệm then met the Council on Foreign Relations, {{where he}} {{promoted}} Vietnamese businese interests and touted his country {{as an ideal}} place for foreign investment. He described Vietnamese people as industrious workers who focused on developing farmland rather than building monuments and palaces. Diệm was given a dinner in his honor at the Ambassador Hotel. It was organized by the AFV and the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The AFV had been formed by Joseph Buttinger, an IRC member who had worked in Saigon in assisting with Operation Passage to Freedom, the mass evacuation of North Vietnamese <b>refugees</b> <b>to</b> the south after the partition of Vietnam in 1954.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s and 1980s, severe power shortages, strikes, and {{a violent}} Naxalite {{movement}} damaged {{much of the}} state's infrastructure, leading to a period of economic stagnation. The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 resulted in the influx of millions of <b>refugees</b> <b>to</b> West Bengal, causing significant strains on its infrastructure. The 1974 smallpox epidemic killed thousands. West Bengal politics underwent a major change when the Left Front won the 1977 assembly election, defeating the incumbent Indian National Congress. The Left Front, led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), governed the state {{for the next three}} decades.|$|E
5|$|Fischer {{attempted}} to gain wider {{support for the}} cooperation schemes already in place and extend their scope in Sector West. Fischer also assured the local authorities of the RSK that {{such a move would}} prevent renewed fighting in the area. The result of Fischer's efforts was the Daruvar Agreement. The agreement, signed in Daruvar on 18 February, encompassed the reconstruction of water and electrical power supply networks, the reopening of the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway section in Sector West for non-commercial traffic, the facilitation of the Novska–Nova Gradiška railway, the repair of telecommunication lines, the establishment of a joint commission tasked with normalisation of living conditions in Sector West, the return of all <b>refugees</b> <b>to</b> their homes, the access to property owned by civilians across the ceasefire line, and further meetings with local authorities to discuss further cooperation.|$|E

5|$|Hundreds {{of members}} of the Bosnian Muslim SS {{divisions}} volunteered to fight in the 1948–1949 Arab–Israeli War. Many were recruited by agents of al-Husayni, who achieved political leadership of the Palestinian Arabs following the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine. The Syrian government also made a request for the transfer of 8,000 Bosnian Muslim <b>refugees</b> <b>to</b> Syria, many for recruitment into the Syrian Armed Forces. Iraq sent representatives to Europe and invited 2,500 Bosnian Muslims to settle in their nation. Frantzman and Culibrk estimate that approximately 1,000 former Bosnian Muslim SS members fought in Palestine, but say it is possible that Bosnian Muslim participation was much more extensive. Contemporary Haganah intelligence records suggest that up to 4,000 Bosnian Muslim volunteers took part. Many of the volunteers served in the Arab Liberation Army's Ajnaddin Battalion, as well as the Army of the Holy War.|$|E

At the same time, Kagame's forces joined with Zairian Tutsi around Goma to attack two of the camps there. Most refugees from the attacked camps moved to the large Mugunga camp. In November 1996 the Rwandan army attacked Mugunga, causing an estimated 800,000 <b>refugees</b> <b>to</b> flee.
