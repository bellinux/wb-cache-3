Min passion kan vara minnet av en byggnad, ett rum, där jag känt ett sug i magen. Jag inspireras av film, teater, foto och konst. Jag vill sträva efter att konsthallen ska skapa samma sug och dragningskraft för människor i Uppsala. Jag har jobbat med att bygga upp konsthallen som olika scener, minnen, {{fragment}} och reflexioner. En egen värld. Jag vill att det ska finnas en vaghet samtidigt som riktning, utåt och inåt. Jag vill även att den ska smälta samman med vattnet och marken runtomkring. Min vision är att vi som besökare dras in i ett sammanhang, en rumslighet, någonting som skiljer sig från vardagen om än bara litegrann. Att komma in i en annan värld.  In {{the beginning}} of this project we had a sketch task,where we would <b>reflect</b> <b>over</b> <b>our</b> passion for architecture. After some introspection I {{came to the conclusion that}} passion can be the memory of a building, a room, somewhere where I felt myself being drawn into something. I am inspired by film, theater, photography and art. I want the art gallery to create a suction and attraction for people of Uppsala. I have strived to create an exhibition hall illustrating different scenes, memories, fragments and reflections. A world of its own. I want it to be a vagueness while direction, outwards and inwards. I also want it to blend in with the water and the soil around it. My vision is that we as visitors are drawn into the spatiality, to make us feel a sense of space, something different from everyday life if only just a little. Make us get access into another world...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the text}} is to present my research, summary and {{analysis}} of selected loft spaces. This task raises an effort to characterize the loft space, presenting its airiness, excitement or a new metaphysical side. This thesis is showing various ways, in which space functions in movies, such as the relationship with time and space, or just focusing on the loft space itself. The aim of this thesis is to discover {{the role of the}} architecture in a movie and how space can influence its characters. The thesis itself is devoted to the discussion on architecture, on how our houses and cities and landscapes are to be formed, it is closely bound up with reflections on how we want to live. In short, one’s view of architecture is one’s view of society. Architecture is not an isolated field; it relates to the surrounding society and our way of thinking and living. In this sense, architecture expresses both our capacity for civilization and our cultural identity. On this basis I consider to focus on the small scale, from the perspective of specific people’s lives. People who decided to live in a loft, which {{is not the same as}} losing sight of the big issues. When it comes to our dreams about our dwellings, we are all experts. Dwelling is a human relationship with the world. Before we can build we must be able to dwell, which means we must <b>reflect</b> <b>over</b> <b>our</b> being in the world. Dwelling is about space in the world. Space can be possessed, made and taken. It can be used, exploited, shared and transferred. A person without space is not present, not living anywhere, has no connection. Dwelling introduces something you can be a part of and manifest yourself in. To sum up, we believe that architecture, design and movies influence each other more than we can imagine...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} some central conceptual ideas expressed {{in the language of}} six computer interested boys. The starting-point is the philosophy of language of Ludwig Wittgenstein, where language is seen as something deeply integrated in our practices, traditions and culture. The use of our language shows its meaning. The material consists of 18 months of observations in the computer room of a secondary school and a series of three deep-interviews with each one of the boys over a period of three years. The computer has a central function in their identity work. Within our culture, this object - with its structure and its ways of operating - has become a metaphor for human thinking. It offers freedom and control. The discussions involved in this work and its form of representation problemize some of the fundamental assumptions of linguistics and the humanities. The three portraits (chapters 3 - 5) are to be understood as meaningful examples, while the persons portrayed are to be seen as symbols, inviting the reader to <b>reflect</b> <b>over</b> <b>our</b> culture and our practices. The fostering into the computer world and the ways of looking at the world are shown through the "personal voice", each followed by an interpretation linked to the theories and results of other researchers. In the boys' ways of using language there are differences and similarities. Learning, growing, creating, signifying 'freedom', can be seen as central notions in the identity work of one of them. With another of the boys there is a strong resemblance in his talking of computers and of his personal God; he "fixes" the world through dividing-lines, strong recommendations, further emphasized through the frequent use of the verb ska (shall, should). In the third portrait it is evident that the boy's abundance of words and narrative-making is a strategy of preventing nearness and to be able both to control the interview situation and to intensify the here and now. "Going deep" into computers make certain assumptions about the world more essential than others. Central concepts explicit in their common language game are logic, power and control (chapter 7). There is a common tendency to hierarchize and dichotomize the world; upper/under world, outer/inner world, logic/feeling, we/they, right/wrong. Stability {{can be seen as a}} summarizing notion. The deeper significance of their feeling of safety and control in the computer world is a fostering both into male dominance and into a dominant way of thinking about knowledge as something primarily logical, controllable and possible to account for. This masculinist language game is confirmed in different ways: individually, in the group and at a more subtle and symbolic level. Diss. Umeå : Univ., 1992 digitalisering@um...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the orbits of the small, inner Saturnian satellites, either {{recovered}} or newly discovered in recentCassini imaging observations. The orbits presented here <b>reflect</b> improvements <b>over</b> <b>our</b> previously published values in that the time base of Cassini observations has been extended, and numerical orbital integrations have been performed in those cases inwhich simple precessing elliptical, inclined orbit solutionswere found to be inadequate. Using combinedCassini and Voyager observations, we obtain an eccentricity for Pan 7 times smaller than previously reported because of the predominance of higher quality Cassini data in the fit. The orbit of the small satellite (S/ 2005 S 1 [Daphnis]) discovered by Cassini in the Keeler gap in the outer A ring appears to be circular and coplanar; no external perturbations are appar-ent. Refined orbits of Atlas, Prometheus, Pandora, Janus, and Epimetheus are based onCassini,Voyager, Hubble Space Telescope, and Earth-based data and a numerical integration perturbed by all themassive satellites and each other. Atlas is significantly perturbed by Prometheus, {{and to a lesser}} extent by Pandora, through high-wavenumber mean-motion reso-nances. Orbital integrations involving Atlas yield a mass ofGMAtlas (0 : 44 0 : 04); 103 km 3 s 2, 3 times larger than reported previously (GM is the product of the Newtonian constant of gravitation G and the satellite massM). Orbital in-tegrations show that Methone is perturbed by Mimas, Pallene is perturbed by Enceladus, and Polydeuces librates around Dione’s L 5 point with a period of about 791 days.
