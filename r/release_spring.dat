50|$|In 2012, {{while waiting}} to begin {{recording}} her third album, Sales {{moved back to}} Los Angeles to pursue acting, {{after several years of}} focusing solely on music. She signed with Paradigm Agency and began studying acting extensively. During this time, she studied vocal technique with Seth Riggs. In 2013, Sales moved up to Vancouver, British Columbia for a recurring role on the TV show, Cedar Cove. Her contract with Universal Music ended during this time and she began raising money through Pledge Music to record her next record. Nearing the completion of her record, Mike Rittberg, former GM at Verve Music Group USA, with whom Sales had been in touch for several years, signed her to his label. In October 2015, Sales signed the contract and began completing the record. It is tentatively scheduled for <b>release</b> <b>Spring</b> 2017. The highly anticipated album is co-produced by Richard Sales, horns/strings arranged by Carl Marsh (Stax Volt), recorded at Oceanway Studios in Nashville TN, mixed by Michael Brauer at Electric Lady Studios NYC, and mastered by Joe LaPorta. The masters were delivered in May 2016.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the demise}} of the band, Tegza rejoined Edwards in the band Elixir, playing a handful of shows in 1971 but never {{releasing}} any recordings. [...] Of the other ex-members of Lovecraft, Grebb went on to form The Fabulous Rhinestones and eventually developed a career as a solo artist and session musician; Been joined Jerry Miller and Bob Mosley (both ex-members of Moby Grape) in Fine Wine and recorded the self-titled Fine Wine album in 1976, before going on to front the new wave band The Call during the 1980s and 1990s; and Donlinger recorded a number of solo albums and published an autobiography titled Space Traveller: A Musician's Odyssey. [...] In 1975, Tegza put together yet another variation of the group, this time a funk band with the name Love Craft, featuring vocalist Lalomie Washburn. [...] Love Craft released the We Love You Whoever You Are album on Mercury Records in 1975 but it sold poorly and as a result, the band were dropped by their label and disbanded shortly thereafter. [...] In 1980, Tegza and Love Craft guitarist Frankie Capek reunited to form a second version of the band, recruiting vocalist Marc Scherer and bassist Mark Gardner to complete the line-up. With a repertoire consisting of contemporary pop music and older psychedelic material, the band garnered some label interest but broke up before they had secured a recording contract, due to Scherer leaving the band. Since then, Tegza has become a Pastor currently living in Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Scherer is currently signed to Frontiers, Italy and records with Grammy winner Jim Peterik of 'Eye of the Tiger' fame. Their upcoming Peterik/Scherer (PS) album 'Risk Everything' is set for <b>release</b> <b>Spring</b> of 2015. Despite the involvement of Tegza and Edwards in Lovecraft and Love Craft, neither band is regarded as being fundamentally connected to H. P. Lovecraft or its history, beyond the obvious similarities in names and crossover member association.|$|E

40|$|This summary {{gives the}} major {{points of the}} Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) {{prepared}} for the Nez Perce Tribal Hatchery by the Nez Perce Tribe (NPT), the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and other interested parties. The Nez Perce once {{were one of the}} largest Plateau tribes in the Northwest and occupied a territory that included north central Idaho, southeastern Washington and northeastern Oregon. Salmon and other migratory fish species are an invaluable food resource and {{an integral part of the}} Nez Perce Tribe`s culture. Anadromous fish have always made up the bulk of the Nez Perce tribal diet and this dependence on salmon was recognized in the treaties made with the Tribe by the US. The historic economic, social, and religious significance of the fish to the Nez Perce Tribe continues to this day, which makes the decline of fish populations in the Columbia River Basin a substantial detrimental impact to the Nez Perce way of life. The Nez Perce Tribal Hatchery is a supplementation program that would rear and <b>release</b> <b>spring,</b> summer, and fall chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), biologically similar to wild fish, to reproduce in the Clearwater River Subbasin. Program managers propose techniques that are compatible with existing aquatic and riparian ecosystems and would integrate hatchery-produced salmon into the stream and river environments needed to complete their life cycle...|$|E
40|$|Despite recent rapid {{increases}} in the occurrence of nonindigenous marine organisms in the marine environment, few studies have critically examined the invasion process for a marine species. Here we use manipulative experiments to examine processes of invasion for the Asian kelp Undaria pinnatifida (Harvey) Suringar at two sites {{on the east coast}} of Tasmania. Disturbance to reduce cover of the native algal canopy was found to be critical in the establishment of U. pinnatifida, while the presence of a stable native algal canopy inhibited invasion. In the first sporophyte growth season following disturbance of the canopy, U. pinnatifida recruited in high densities (up to 19 plants m 2) while remaining rare or absent in un-manipulated plots. The timing of disturbance was also important. U. pinnatifida recruited in higher densities in plots where the native canopy was removed immediately prior to the sporophyte growth season (winter 2000), compared with plots where the canopy was removed 6 months earlier during the period of spore <b>release</b> (<b>spring</b> 1999). Removal of the native canopy also resulted in a significant increase in cover of sediment on the substratum. In the second year following canopy removal, U. pinnatifida abundance declined significantly, associated with a substantial recovery of native canopy-forming species. A feature of the recovery of the native algal canopy was a significant shift in species composition. Species dominant prior to canopy removal showed little if any signs of recovery. The recovery was instead dominated by canopyforming species that were either rare or absent in the study areas prior to manipulation of the canopy...|$|E
