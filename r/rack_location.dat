It uses a 50 MeV electron linac and 1. 5 F eV, 1 Hz, booster synchrotron for injection into a l- 2 GcV storage ring. Interesting control problems arc created {{because of the need}} for dynamic closed beam orbit control to eliminate interaction between the ring tuning requirements and to minimize orbit shifts due to ground vibrations. The extremely signal sensitive nature of the expcrimcnts rcquircs special attention to the sources of electrical noise. These requirements have led to a control system design which emphasizes connectivity at the accelerator equipment end and a large I/O bandwidth for closed loop system response. Not overlooked are user friendlyness, o tp crater response time, modcling, and expert system provisions. ortable consoles are used for local operation of machine equipment.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is the {{development}} of control algorithms for the management of an automated warehouse system. As usual, the implementation of a control algorithm requires three preliminary steps: Development of a reliable model; design of control procedures according to some optimality criteria; validation of these control procedures. As for modelling, a new level in the control architecture, namely an optimizer system, is introduced which performs real-time optimization thus simplifying the low-level control and improving the overall performance. In this context, the role of a detailed model of the whole warehouse is discussed and such a model is built up by using the colored timed Petri nets framework. As for control, we propose two control algorithms, derived under the simplifying continuity assumption of the <b>rack</b> <b>locations,</b> to optimize the operations of the cranes (moving within the aisles of the warehouse) and the operations of the shuttle (moving on a straight line placed between the aisles and the picking/refilling area), respectively. To evaluate the performance of the proposed control algorithms we define three different cost indices. As for the validation, extensive simulations are performed on the model in order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms. A further validation of the algorithms has been performed on a test bed in order to take into account communication delays and computation times. Finally, the proposed architecture and control algorithms have been applied to a real plant...|$|R
40|$|Monte Carlo {{criticality}} {{safety and}} sensitivity calculations of {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) spent nuclear fuel repository facilities for the Slovenian nuclear power plant Krsko are presented. The MCNP 4 C code was deployed to model and assess the neutron multiplication parameters of pool-based storage and dry transport containers under various loading patterns and moderating conditions. To comply with standard safety requirements, fresh 4. 25 % enriched nuclear fuel was assumed. The impact of potential optimum moderation due to water steam or foam formation {{as well as of}} different interpretations, of neutron multiplication through varying the system boundary conditions was elaborated. The simulations indicate {{that in the case of}} compact (all <b>rack</b> <b>locations</b> filled with fresh fuel) single or "double tiering" loading, the supercriticality can occur under the conditions of enhanced neutron moderation, due to accidentally reduced density of cooling water. Under standard operational conditions the effective multiplication factor (k(eff)) of pool-based storage facility remains below the specified safety limit of 0. 95. The nuclear safety requirements are fulfilled even when the fuel elements are arranged at a minimal distance, which can be initiated, for example, by an earthquake. The dry container in its recommended loading scheme with 26 fuel elements represents a safe alternative for the repository, of fresh fuel. Even in the case of complete water flooding, the keff remains below the specified safety level of 0. 98. The criticality safety limit may however be exceeded with larger amounts of loaded fuel assemblies (i. e., 32). Additional Monte Carlo criticality safety analyses are scheduled to consider the "burnup credit" of PWR spent nuclear fuel, based on the ongoing calculation of typical burnup activities...|$|R

The Node 1 ISS Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) design featured limited ECLS capability. The main purpose of Node 1 was to provide internal storage by providing four stowage <b>rack</b> <b>locations</b> within the module and to allow docking of multiple modules and a truss segment to it. The ECLS subsystems inside Node 1 were routed through the element prior to launch to allow for easy integration of the attached future elements, particularly the Habitation Module which was planned to be located at the nadir docking port of Node 1. After Node 1 was on-orbit, the Program decided not to launch the Habitation Module and instead, {{to replace it with}} Node 3 (Tranquility). In 2007, the Program became concerned with a potential Russian docking port approach issue for the Russian FGB nadir docking port after Node 3 is attached to Node 1.

40|$|The Space Station Furnace Facility (SSFF) is a {{facility}} {{located in the}} International Space Station United States Laboratory (ISS US Lab) for materials research in the microgravity environment. The SSFF will accommodate basic research, commercial applications, and studies of phenomena of metals and alloys, electronic and photonic materials, and glasses and ceramics. To support this broad base of research requirements, the SSFF will operate, regulate, and support a variety of Experiment Modules (EMs). To meet station requirements concerning the microgravity level needed for experiments, station is providing an active vibration isolation system, and SSFF provides the interface. SSFF physically consists of a Core Rack and two instrument racks (IRs) that occupy three adjacent ISS US Lab <b>rack</b> <b>locations</b> within the International Space Station (ISS). All SSFF racks are modified International Standard Payload Racks (ISPR). SSFF racks will have a 50 % larger pass through area on the lower sides than ISPRs to accommodate the many rack to rack interconnections. The Instrument Racks are further modified with lowered floors and an additional removable panel (15 " x 22 ") {{on top of the}} rack for access if needed. The Core Rack shall contain all centralized Core subsystems and ISS subsystem equipment. The two Instrument Racks shall contain the distributed Core subsystem equipment, ISS subsystem equipment, and the EMs. The Core System, which includes the Core Rack, the IR structures, and subsystem components located in the IRs serves as the central control and management for the IRs and the EMs. The Core System receives the resources provided by the International Space Station (ISS) and modifies, allocates, and distributes these resources to meet the operational requirements of the furnace. The Core System is able to support a total of four EMs and can control, support, and activate/deactivate the operations of two EMs, simultaneously. The IRs can be configured to house two small EMs or one tall vertical EM, and serve as the interface between the Core and the respective EM.

40|$|Boral is a cermet of Boron Carbide 'B{sub 4 }C' in {{aluminum}} clad {{in aluminum}}. It is manufactured in rolled sheets using techniques {{similar to those}} used in the production of uranium aluminum fuel elements. The core of the standard Boral contains 35 % boron carbide by weight. Cladding material is typical 1100 aluminum. Where it is exposed to water in service, the edges of the Boral are recommended by the manufacturer to be clad with aluminum by welding. In Spent Fuel Pool (SFP) racks, the Boral is usually not a structural member but is inserted in cavities between the spent fuel storage positions in the <b>racks.</b> In these <b>locations</b> it is sealed by welding to prevent access of water. Inherently, however, the corrosion of the Boral, both the boron carbide-aluminum cermet and the aluminum cladding, should be minimal in a spent fuel storage pool. The cavities into which the Boral is sealed are typically fabricated of aluminum alloys, i. e. type 6061, or stainless steel. In either case, these are the structural members of the SFP racks. In an SFP, water chemistry tends to be strictly controlled because the SFP water mixes with the reactor coolant during refueling procedures. In SFP's at BWR sites, water chemistry is typical of that of a BWR i. e. high resistivity neutral water. In SFP's at PWR sites water chemistry typically contains 2 to 3, 000 parts per million ppm boron as boric acid, which is there primarily to prevent dilution of the reactor primary coolant during refueling and is not relied on for criticality considerations.
