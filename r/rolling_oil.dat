40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{spectroscopy}} is {{a unique}} technique {{that is capable of}} detecting extremely fine traces of <b>rolling</b> <b>oil</b> left on the surface of cold-rolled steel sheets. In this study we have demonstrated that a characteristic mechanical loss spectrum occurs in the low-temperature range from 180 K to 280 K only in the two following situations: (1) if traces of the <b>rolling</b> <b>oil</b> are left on the surface of sheets or (2) if the sheets are covered with a thin film of the <b>rolling</b> <b>oil.</b> Nearly the same loss spectra have been observed in subresonant mechanical loss measurements of paper micro-samples covered with a thin film of <b>rolling</b> <b>oil.</b> It can therefore be concluded that the observed mechanical loss phenomena take place in the <b>rolling</b> <b>oil,</b> that is, they do not depend on whether the substrate is metallic or paper. Moreover, the subresonant mechanical spectroscopy can readily resolve the complex mechanical loss spectrum into three constituent peaks located at 188 K, 215 K, and at around 270 K, respectively. Rolling oils containing different amounts of sulphur generate low-temperature peaks of substantially different height. The asymmetrical peak observed at 270 K on heating is produced by a phase transformation of the <b>rolling</b> <b>oil</b> from the solid into liquid phase...|$|E

It was observed that the combined effect of a greater <b>rolling</b> <b>oil</b> volume applied, larger bar thickness, and smaller amount of water flow during interstand cooling reduces the tertiary scale thickness.

Infrared absorbance spectra of the samples were then collected and the reference values obtained with GC were used together with these spectra for model building. Inverse least squares method was optimized with a genetic algorithm by selecting the most contributing regions of the infrared spectra for each component. The R 2 values between GC and multivariate spectroscopic determinations were around 0. 99 indicating a good correlation between the two methods. Performance of genetic algorithm based multivariate calibration models were also compared with partial least squares (PLS) method.

Multivariate calibration models were generated for both synthetic mixtures and real process samples taken from an industrial aluminum production plant. Two different additives and six different suspected contaminants were investigated in the base oil lubricant. Gas chromatography (GC) was used for the analysis of real process samples in order to establish reference values of additives and contaminants in the base <b>rolling</b> <b>oil.</b> FTIR spectra of real samples together with the reference values established with GC analysis were used to generate multivariate calibration models. GC analysis revealed that most of the contaminants gave overlapped chromatograms and therefore only the total contamination was determined with reference GC analysis. On the other hand, FTIR spectroscopy coupled with multivariate calibration was able to resolve overlapping components with synthetic samples. The reference values for both additives and contaminants obtained by GC were compared with the results of the spectroscopic analysis. The multivariate calibration models based on spectroscopic data validated with the real process samples in a period of twelve months, however only a set of 3 -month data is given in this thesis.

40|$|Ultrafiltration of {{emulsified}} oil {{in water}} wastestreams from waste cutting and grinding operations, waste <b>rolling</b> <b>oil</b> solutions, and alkaline degreasing baths can produce an effluent water phase that is acceptable for discharge to sewer systems. Since ultrafiltration membranes {{act as a}} physical barrier between the wastestream and the clean water effluent, operator or flow caused upsets are prevented, ensuring no carryover of oil to the effluent. The effluent (permeate) from the ultrafiltration system is usually of sufficient quality for discharge to a sanitary sewer system. The permeate, as a rule, contains less than 100 mgll of freon-extractable oil and grease and less than 10 mgll suspended solids. The ultrafiltration process also produces a liquid oil concentrate containing up to 60 % oil and solids, which can be disposed of by hauling or incineration. The concentrate will be only 3. 5 % of the original volume. No sludge containing large amounts of chemicals and heavy metals is produced in ultrafiltration because no such chemicals are required as in other methods of treating oily emulsions.

The difference between years may be partly attributed to better meeting the fertility and soil moisture needs of meristemmed plants in 1994. Plants were not moisture-stressed near harvest, and plots were fertilized according to stem and soil nitrate levels. Both visual ratings and detailed measurement of plant growth indicated little difference in the growth and growth habit between meristemmed and non-meristemmed plants in 1994. Nevertheless, in 1994, plants in meristemmed plots required supplementary nitrogen, whereas in 1993 they became nitrogen deficient, which {{may have contributed to}} reduced oil production, enhanced stem mass over leaf mass, reduced branching, etc., in 1993.

40|$|During {{the cold}} {{reduction}} of steel sheet in a rolling mill, rolling oils {{are used for}} lubrication to provide the desired steel surface. <b>Rolling</b> <b>oil</b> formulations consist largely of mineral oils, glycerides and/or synthetic esters, fatty acids, emulsifiers and additives. These oils are generally used as 2 - 5 % emulsions and will be subjected to high temperature and pressure during use. This results in chemical changes within the oil that can affect steel surface cleanliness after annealing. It is advantageous to have rolling oils that are stable but easily removed during annealing and leaving a minimal amount of residues. Thus {{in the field of}} rolling mill technology the surface quality of rolled product and stability of rolling oils are critical in the selection of lubricants. Additionally, production cost and environmental impact are also critical in the selection of lubricants. In this study, the performance of vegetable-based rolling oils was investigated by recording the FTIR spectra of the oils using Horizontal Attenuated Total Reflectance, an internal reflection accessory, before and after systematic heat treatment. Evidence was found that the vegetable-based oils degraded on heating and the spectroscopic analysis indicated that this was due to rearrangement of unsaturated components from a cis to a trans configuration.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the physical processes which determine friction and lubrication in metal rolling in the mixed lubrication regime, with particular attention paid to the conditions encountered when rolling aluminium foil. Two areas of relevance to the analysis of the rolling process are initially investigated. Firstly, the rheological properties of a typical aluminium foil <b>rolling</b> <b>oil</b> at high pressures and shear rates have been measured using a disc machine. The behaviour of the oil was found to be well described by the Eyring viscous model, at the shear rates and pressure likely to be found in metal rolling. Secondly, the deformation of asperities when the bulk material is deforming has been examined. The theory developed here was found to agree reasonably with experiments. The results of these investigations are used in the analysis of lubrication in metal rolling, considering the hydrodynamic buildup of oil pressure in the entry region and the crushing of the asperities both in the entry region and {{at the beginning of the}} work zone. The contact between roll and strip is divided into two regions, that under the asperities and that in the intervening valleys. Calculations for conditions appropriate to strip and foil rolling give the proportion of the two types of contact and the film thicknesses in each region. Measurements of film thicknesses with an experimental mill in a regime where roughness is unimportant were not found to agree well with an existing simple theory of lubrication. This was ascribed to uneven lubrication in the experiments. After taking this into account, the experiments in a regime where roughness was important were found to agree reasonably with the theory developed here. The effect of roughness on traction is measured in a disc machine with elastic contacts. Its behaviour is found to be determined by the bulk properties of the lubricant at the pressures and strain rates under the asperities. Theory and experiments presented in this dissertation lead to a greater understanding of the physical processes determining friction in metal rolling in the mixed lubrication regime. Film thicknesses and friction coefficients (in metal rolling) may now be estimated with more confidence...|$|E
40|$|Lubricant oils {{are used}} {{for a range of}} {{applications}}. One of the applications are as <b>rolling</b> <b>oil</b> for drawing of metal wires. Sandvik AB is a company that produces metal wires and other products using rolling mills and are therefore dependent on lubricant oils for their operation. A problem Sandvik AB encountered were that contaminants in the oil that comes from the operation itself damaged the wires in various ways and leads to stops in the production and material waste. Conventional filter cleaning was not effective enough which lead to an increased concentration of small particles and a need to change the oil in the system four times per year. RecondOil AB {{come up with a way}} to recycle the oil and remove particles from the oil, that is too small or light to be removed with filters or centrifuges, with a system called ROCCO. The goal with this screening LCA is to quantify the environmental impacts of the two systems, regarding global warming potential, acidifying potential and human toxicity potential. The geographical boundary is Sweden. The functional unit is based on production of wires, but as the production numbers is not available for the public a ten-year production of wires will be set to 100 units for the ROCCO system and will be the functional unit. Global warming potential, acidifying potential and human toxicity potential are reduced with around 90 percent after the installation of ROCCO, this is roughly equal to the reduction in oil use compared to the original system. After weighting of the impact categories, with the EDIP 97 method, it is possible to conclude that the global warming potential is the impact category with the largest environmental impact of the impact categories assessed in this study. If the waste oil is re-refined instead of incinerated, as it has been calculated in the main model, the impact on global warming is about 15 percent lower with the ROCCO system compared with the original system. If the ROCCO system was run with a German energy mix instead of Swedish energy mix, as in the main model, the impact on global warming is about 60 percent lower with the ROCCO system compared with the original system. If the ROCCO system is run on German energy mix and the waste oil are re-refined the impact on global warming are larger with the ROCCO system compared with the original system. 2016 - 06 - 29 </p...|$|E

40|$|Increase of both {{roll and}} strip surface {{temperatures}} can significantly affect a rolling process, roll conditions and strip mechanical properties. A comprehensive thermal analysis in cold rolling, {{especially in a}} mixed film regime, is needed to understand how thermal fields develop in roll and strip during rolling. It requires a simultaneous solution of the mixed film model for friction in the roll bite and the thermal model for roll and strip thermal fields. This paper presents a numerical procedure to analyse strip rolling process using lubrication with oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions. The thermal model includes the effect of heat generation due to the strip deformation and frictional shear stress at the asperity contacts. The numerical analysis employs a coupled thermal model and a mixed film lubrication model for calculating the friction and the asperity deformation in the bite. The thermal model considers the initial temperatures of the roll and strip, temperature rise due to the strip plastic deformation and friction. While the O/W mixed-film lubrication model {{takes into account the}} effect of surface roughness and oil concentration (%vol) of the emulsion. The thermal effect is analysed in terms of strip surface temperature and roll temperature, which are influenced by rolling parameters such as reduction, <b>rolling</b> speed, <b>oil</b> concentration in the emulsion. The results of the parametric study indicate that the effect of oil concentration on the thermal field is relatively small compared to that of reduction ratio and rolling speed. The reduction ratio increases the maximum interface temperature in the roll bite. In the mixed film regime, rolling speed also increases the maximum interface temperature and alters the temperature field of the strip. The numerical procedure was validated against known experimental data and can readily be extended to hot rolling or used to analyse roll strip temperature subjected to different cooling system...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{electrification}} through {{natural gas}} in Mexico, {{the interest of}} the country to mitigate the effects of climate change, and the opportunity for <b>rolling</b> out Enhanced <b>Oil</b> Recovery at national level requires an important R&D effort to develop nationally relevant CCS technology in natural gas combined cycle power plants. Post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO 2) capture at gas-fired power plant is identified and proposed as an effective way to reduce CO 2 emissions generated by the electricity sector in Mexico. In particular, gas-fired power plants with carbon dioxide capture and the sequential combustion of supplementary natural gas in the heat recovery steam generator can favourably increase the production of carbon dioxide, compared to a conventional configuration. This could be attractive in places with favourable conditions for enhanced oil recovery and where affordable natural gas prices will continue to exist, such as Mexico and North America. Sequential combustion makes use of the excess oxygen in gas turbine exhaust gas to generate additional CO 2. But, unlike in conventional supplementary firing, allows keeping gas temperatures in the heat recovery steam generator below 820 °C, avoiding a step change in capital costs. It marginally decreases relative energy requirements for solvent regeneration and amine degradation.

40|$|Abstract This study {{concentrates}} on developing and tuning various oil analysis methods {{to meet the}} requirements of modern industry and environmental analytics. Oil analysis methods form a vital part of techniques used to monitor the condition of machines and may help to improve the overall equipment effectiveness value of a factory in a significant manner. Worm gears are used in various production machines, and their breakdowns may cause significant production losses. Wearing of these gears is relatively difficult to monitor with vibration analysis. Analysis of two indicator metals, copper and iron, may reveal wearing phenomena of worm gears effectively, and savings can be significant. Effective wear metal analysis requires good tools. ICP-OES with kerosene dilution is widely used in wear metal analysis, but purchasing and using of ICP-OES is expensive. A cheaper FAAS technique with similar pre-treatment of oil samples was tested and it proved to be useful especially in analyzing small amounts of samples. The accuracy of FAAS was sufficient for quantitative work in machine diagnostics and waste oil characterization. Solid debris analyses are useful in oil contamination control as well as in detection of wearing mechanisms. Membrane filtration, optical microscopy, SEM and automatic particle counting were applied in analysis of <b>rolling</b> and gear <b>oils.</b> Particle counting is an effective way to detect oil contamination, but in the studied cases even larger particles than those detected in normal ISO classes would be informative. However, membrane filtration and optical microscopy may reveal the wearing machine element exactly. Additives provide oils with desired properties thus they should be monitored intensively. A FTIR method for quantitative analysis of fatty alcohols and fatty acid esters in machinery oils was developed during this work. It has already been used successfully in quantitative and qualitative analysis of machinery oil samples. Various kinds of oils may be spilled into the soil during use and in accident situations, and they can migrate to groundwater layers. Biodegradation of oils can remove them from the soil or water completely or at least diminish the amount of harmful substances. An automatic, respirometric BOD OxiTop method was used to evaluate the biodegradability of various oils in water and soil media. The biodegradation of certain bio and mineral hydraulic oils was evaluated in groundwater, where bio oils usually biodegraded more effectively than mineral oils. The use of oils in machines weakened especially the biodegradability of bio oils. Biodegradability of bio oils was also studied in standard conditions of OECD 301 F and bio oils usually biodegraded moderately good in these conditions. The biodegradation of forestry chain oils and wood preservative oils was evaluated in forest soils. Linseed oil biodegraded moderately, but certain experimental wood preservatives biodegraded more effectively. Widely used creosote oil biodegraded in a lesser degree.
