5|$|The flaps {{are mounted}} by steel sliders and rollers, {{attached}} to brackets on the <b>rear</b> <b>spar.</b> The trapezoidal ailerons {{are near the}} wingtips. The fuselage of the Su-25 has an ellipsoidal section and is of semi-monocoque, stressed-skin construction, arranged as a longitudinal load-bearing framework of longerons, beams and stringers, with a transverse load-bearing assembly of frames. The one-piece horizontal tailplane {{is attached to the}} load-bearing frame at two mounting points.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{determined that}} a spar on the front left of the wing separated, quickly followed by the lower <b>rear</b> <b>spar</b> and the connections which attached the outer wing to the center section. The loss of the left wing caused the aircraft to roll left, whereupon the fuselage and the right horizontal stabilizer collided with the separated wing. The initial separation was caused either by a wind gust in excess of operating velocity, or a similar lower-velocity gust after the material had become fatigued.|$|E
25|$|The Dongó's wings {{were simply}} braced {{compared}} with most biplanes of the day, with an arrangement {{made possible by}} the narrow chord and large stagger. A single, vertical, faired interplane strut on each side braced the <b>rear</b> <b>spar</b> of the upper wing to the lower forward spar. Towards its top a metal faired-in oblique strut braced the forward, upper spar and there was a similar arrangement at its foot to the <b>rear</b> <b>spar.</b> To minimise drag, there were no conventional cross bracing flying wires but instead a single, faired diagonal strut from the top of each interplane struts to the corresponding lower fuselage longeron.|$|E
5000|$|The Wibault 220 was {{powered by}} two [...] Gnome-Rhône 9Ac Jupiter nine-cylinder radial engines, each wing-mounted under the outer centre-section. They were {{attached}} at three {{points on the}} front and <b>rear</b> <b>spars</b> by a system of duralumin plates and steel tubes and were enclosed in teardrop cowlings with their cylinder heads exposed for cooling.|$|R
50|$|The Potez 40 was an {{all-metal}} aircraft {{covered with}} duralumin, longitudinally corrugated at approximately 100 mm pitch throughout. The wing was rectangular in plan {{apart from its}} rounded tips and was built around two I-section spars. On each side a parallel pair of airfoil section struts braced the wing from the forward and <b>rear</b> <b>spars</b> to the lower fuselage longeron.|$|R
50|$|The {{wings are}} {{constructed}} of tubular front and <b>rear</b> <b>spars.</b> The wings and flying control surfaces {{are covered in}} Kevlar/Mylar/Polyester laminate. The wings can be removed or folded (if an optional folding kit is installed) for storage and transportation. The wing tips are of composite construction which reduces drag and improves low speed handling. Access to the cabin is provided by two gull-wing doors.|$|R
25|$|The AX2000 is {{certificated}} as a glider tug, for gliders {{of class}} 1 and 2. A V-shaped forward tow line extension joins {{the main line}} {{to a pair of}} tug pillars attached to the <b>rear</b> <b>spar</b> on the under surfaces of the AX2000's wing.|$|E
25|$|The all-wood wing pairs {{comprised}} {{a single}} structural unit throughout the wingspan, with no central longitudinal joint. Instead, the spars ran from wingtip to wingtip. There {{was a single}} continuous main spar and another continuous <b>rear</b> <b>spar.</b> Because of the combination of dihedral with the forward sweep of the trailing edges of the wings, this <b>rear</b> <b>spar</b> {{was one of the}} most complex units to laminate and to finish machining after the bonding and curing. It had to produce the correct 3D tilt in each of two planes. Also it was designed and made to taper from the wing roots towards the wingtips. Both principal spars were of ply box construction, using in general 0.25 in. plywood webs with laminated spruce flanges, plus a number of additional reinforcements and special details.|$|E
25|$|The CASA III was a {{parasol wing}} {{monoplane}} with a fabric-covered steel tube fuselage. It had two tandem open cockpits and wide tack fixed {{conventional landing gear}} with a tail skid. The wings were hinged at the <b>rear</b> <b>spar</b> {{and they could be}} folded for storage or transport.|$|E
50|$|Wing and {{fuselage}} {{were joined}} by two parallel pairs of streamlined struts on each side, the members of each pair attached to the forward and <b>rear</b> <b>spars.</b> The innermost pair connected the wing at about one-third span to the upper fuselage longeron and the outer pair ran from about two-thirds span to an undercarriage extension. Each pair was wire braced and the each outer pair also braced from their midpoints to the upper ends of the inner pair.|$|R
50|$|The Perch had {{a wooden}} {{structure}} covered with fabric. It had wings of equal span and constant chord with no sweep but some stagger. Horn balanced ailerons were fitted to both {{upper and lower}} wings. The Perch was a two bay biplane, though the inner interplane struts were close to the fuselage. Just inboard of these struts and on each side, pairs of bracing struts linked the two forward wing spars via {{a connection to the}} fuselage centre line, with a similar connection between the <b>rear</b> <b>spars.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Meteor F.1 was {{powered by}} two Rolls-Royce Welland {{turbojet}} engines, Britain's first production jet engines, which were built under license from Whittle's designs. The Meteor embodied {{the advent of}} practical jet propulsion; in the type's service life, both military and civil aviation manufacturers would rapidly integrate turbine engines into their designs, favouring its advantages such as smoother running and greater power output. The Meteor's engines were considerably more practical {{than those of the}} German Me 262, having both a longer service life and being more efficient; unlike the Me 262, the engines were embedded into the wing in nacelles between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>spars</b> rather than underslung.|$|R
25|$|The wings were {{fitted with}} slotted flaps and full length {{leading edge slats}} and could be folded for compact, ship-board stowage. They also had a {{variable}} angle of incidence, pivoting at the front spar and actuated by an electrically driven jackscrew attached to the <b>rear</b> <b>spar.</b> This arrangement reduced stalling speed and increased lift, allowing the aircraft to use a smaller wing – compactness being an important feature for a ship-borne aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The AAIB {{also studied}} the {{crashworthiness}} {{of the aircraft}} during the accident sequence. It observed that the main attachment point for the main landing gear (MLG) was the <b>rear</b> <b>spar</b> of the aircraft's wing; because this spar also formed the rear wall of the main fuel tanks, the crash landing caused the tanks to rupture. It was recommended that Boeing redesign the landing gear attachment to {{reduce the likelihood of}} fuel loss in similar circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The wooden, cantilever, two-spar {{wing of the}} U 7 {{was almost}} {{trapezoidal}} in plan, with sweep on the leading edge, out to ellipsoidal tips. It also thinned outwards in section {{with most of the}} taper on the upper surface, giving some anhedral. Short ailerons extended to the tips. The wing was mounted over the fuselage on six streamlined steel struts; two upright tripods ran from the forward spar to points on the upper and mid fuselage and two inverted V-struts joined the <b>rear</b> <b>spar</b> to the upper fuselage.|$|E
500|$|The {{fuel system}} {{comprised}} two fuel tanks between the main (forward) and <b>rear</b> <b>spars</b> of the (inner) anhedral wing {{section of the}} port and starboard wings, each with [...] capacity. The tanks also had a predetermined limit which, if passed, would warn the pilot via a red warning light in the cockpit. The fuel was injected via a pump from the tanks to the power plant. Should this shut down, it could be pumped manually using a hand-pump on the fuel cock armature. The powerplant was cooled by a , ring-shaped aluminium water container situated between the propeller and engine. A further container of [...] was positioned under the engine.|$|R

The powerplant was cooled by a 10 L, ring-shaped aluminium water container situated between the propeller and engine. A further container of 20 L was positioned under the engine.|$|R
25|$|The {{cantilever}} gulled wings followed {{normal practice}} with a plywood-covered torsion box leading edge, mainspar, ribs and false <b>rear</b> <b>spar</b> {{to support the}} full-span flaps and ailerons. DFS-style airbrakes were fitted {{at the rear of}} the mainspar with the upper plates hinging forwards and the lower plates hinging rearwards. A comprehensive instrument panel was fitted in the cockpit which included:-A large plaque on the instrument panel; AirSpeed Indicator (8), Vertical Speed Indicator to 5m/s, Vertical Speed Indicator to 15m/s, an artificial horizon with slip ball, altimeter, longitudinal clinometer, stopwatch, compass and oxygen pressure gauge (oxygen equipment was housed behind the pilots seat).|$|E
25|$|The Avid Flyer is a {{conventional}} layout, single engine, {{side by side}} two seat light aircraft, with a strut-braced high wing configuration. Aluminum tubes serve as leading edge/main spar and <b>rear</b> <b>spar,</b> each wing being supported {{by a pair of}} tubular lift struts. Sawn plywood wing ribs are bonded to the aluminum tube spars using a filled epoxy compound. The Avid Flyer features Junkers style one-piece flaperons supported by three offset hinge arms. The Junkers design moves the control surfaces well underneath the wing, where they remain in undisturbed smooth airflow at low speed and/or higher climb angles.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} the Bf 109's {{advanced}} design {{was the use of}} a single, I-beam main spar in the wing, positioned more aft than usual (to give enough room for the retracted wheel), thus forming a stiff D-shaped torsion box. Most aircraft of the era used two spars, near the front and rear edges of the wings, but the D-box was much stiffer torsionally, and eliminated the need for the <b>rear</b> <b>spar.</b> The wing profile was the NACA 2R1 14.2 at the root and NACA 2R1 11.35 at the tip, with a thickness to chord ratio of 14.2% at the root and 11.35% at the tip.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{pre-production}} Gypsy, the BG 135, flew in March 1972. It {{differed from}} the earlier versions chiefly in its wing construction, having the foam-stabilised thin skin of the BG 100s replaced by an aluminium alloy skinned D-box leading edge, based on the main spar, and with fabric covering between main and <b>rear</b> <b>spars.</b> The best glide angle of the BG 135 is 33:1. It gained a Certificate of Airworthiness in July 1972. [...] After demonstrations at the British National Gliding Championships, held from 27 May to 4 June 1972, the BG 135 was loaned to several Clubs for evaluation. Following some minor modifications, production of a batch of seven was prepared.|$|R
25|$|Initially, the {{structure}} of the Hurricane's cantilever wing consisted of two steel spars, which possessed considerable strength and stiffness. The wing was described by aviation publication Flight as being relatively straightforward to manufacture, employing simple vertical jigs to attach the two spars, after which the wing ribs would be installed using horizontal bolts, forming separate units between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>spars.</b> Hydraulically-actuated split trailing edge flaps were present on the inner end of the wings. The original wing was predominantly fabric-covered, like the fuselage, while some use of lightweight metal sheets was made upon the exterior surface of the inner wing and its leading edge. The majority of the Flight control surfaces, such as the Frise-type ailerons, also had fabric coverings.|$|R
50|$|Lateral {{control was}} {{effected}} by wing warping, {{and in order}} to prevent fatiguing of the structure caused by warping loads the <b>rear</b> wing <b>spar</b> was built in three sections, the outer sections being hinged to the centre section, and the wing ribs were loosely threaded onto the spars.|$|R
25|$|Investigators {{found nothing}} in the {{wreckage}} to indicate {{there had been an}} explosion or fire in the aircraft prior to it striking the ground. It was immediately clear that the outer part of the left wing had broken away from the aircraft. The lower boom in the main spar had failed at the outboard edge of the engine nacelle and then the upper boom had also failed {{as the result of the}} wing folding upwards under the air loads imposed on it. The <b>rear</b> <b>spar</b> had then failed, allowing the entire outer part of the wing to separate from the aircraft and drift slowly to the ground.|$|E
25|$|Like these earlier Caudrons, the Type F was a wire braced two bay biplane {{with two}} spar fabric covered wings {{having the same}} {{rectangular}} plan apart from angled tips. Upper and lower spans were in the ratio 1.8. There was no stagger, so {{the two sets of}} parallel interplane struts were parallel and vertical. The outer sections of the upper wings were supported by parallel pairs of outward leaning struts from the bases of the outer interplane struts, {{at the tip of the}} lower wing. The <b>rear</b> <b>spar</b> was ahead of mid-chord, leaving the ribs in the rear part of the wing flexible and allowing roll control by wing warping.|$|E
25|$|The Sprat, {{though a}} smaller aircraft, had strong family resemblances {{to the earlier}} Velos torpedo bomber. The Sprat was a staggered, single-bay biplane with equal-span wings that could be folded for carrier stowage. The {{fuselage}} centre section was built around a tubular-steel structure which linked the engine mounting and the wooded-framed rear fuselage. The two dual-control open cockpits were both behind {{the trailing edge of}} the wing for optimum visibility. Unusually, the instruments were placed on the <b>rear</b> <b>spar</b> of the upper wing centre section, where they could be read from both cockpits. The rudder area was large compared to that of the fin and a braced tailplane was placed on top of the rear fuselage.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{radical and}} unusual shape, the {{airframe}} was built along traditional lines. Except {{for the most}} highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy. The airframe was broken down {{into a number of}} major assemblies: the centre section, a rectangular box containing the bomb-bay and engine bays bounded by the front and <b>rear</b> <b>spars</b> and the wing transport joints; the intakes and centre fuselage; the front fuselage, incorporating the pressure cabin; the nose; the outer wings; the leading edges; the wing trailing edge and tail end of the fuselage; the wings were not sealed and used directly as fuel tankage, but carried bladders for fuel in the void spaces of the wings; and there was a single swept tail fin with a single rudder on the trailing edge.|$|R
50|$|He {{took the}} plane {{up in front}} of a crowd of 50,000 (inside the Fairgrounds—with another 200,000 on the hills), made a loop, and turned the plane onto its back. He may have been so intent on {{leveling}} the plane inverted he failed to notice he was only 2000 ft above San Francisco Bay. He pulled on the controls to pull the plane out of its inverted position, where it was slowly sinking. The strain caused the <b>rear</b> <b>spars</b> in its wings to break, and the crumpled plane plunged into the bay between two ships. Navy men jumped into action, but it took 1 hour and 45 minutes to recover Beachey's body. Even then, rescuers spent three hours trying to revive him. The autopsy found he had survived the crash and had died from drowning.|$|R
50|$|On April 5, 1945, the {{prototype}} Ryan XFR-1 Fireball, BuNo 48234, piloted by Ryan test pilot Dean Lake, {{on a test}} flight over Lindbergh Field, lost skin between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>spars</b> of the starboard wing, interrupting airflow over the wing and causing it to disintegrate. The pilot bailed out and the airframe broke up. Wreckage struck brand new Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer, BuNo 59836, just accepted by the Navy and preparing to depart for the modification center at Litchfield Park, Arizona. The bomber burns and the Navy crew of pilot Lt. D. W. Rietz, Lt. J. E. Creed, and Aviation Machinists Mates G. R. Brown and J. H. Randall, evacuated the burning PB4Y, with only Randall suffering injuries of first, second, and third degree burns and minor lacerations.|$|R
25|$|During early 1943, a {{production}} {{line for the}} Tempest V was established in Hawker's Langley facility, alongside the existing manufacturing line for the Hawker Hurricane. Production was initially slow, claimed {{to be due to}} issues encountered with the <b>rear</b> <b>spar.</b> On 21 June 1943, the first production Tempest V, JN729, rolled off the production line and its maiden flight was conducted by test pilot Bill Humble. Several early production aircraft were used for experimental purposes; a number of these underwent extensive service trials at Boscombe Down including clearances to be fitted with external stores, including 500lb (227kg) and 1,000lb (454kg) bombs and 3in (76.2mm) RP-3 rockets, although few Tempest Vs deployed such ordnance operationally during the War. On 8 April 1944, the Tempest V attained general clearance.|$|E
25|$|The Gull was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane, {{constructed of}} wood with fabric covering. The wings reduced outwards in both thickness and chord, with dihedral outboard of the centre section. They were constructed according to Basil Henderson's patent, and folded rearwards at the <b>rear</b> <b>spar</b> for storage. There were split flaps inboard. The fin and rudder were initially {{very similar to}} those of the Hendy 302, with a horn balance and a notable nick on the leading edge where that balance met the fin, but this was soon replaced by the final symmetric, elliptical and unbalanced arrangement. The horizontal surfaces were also rounded, and tail plane incidence was adjustable in flight for trim; the elevators were mounted on a common shaft.|$|E
25|$|Various {{engineering}} refinements {{that had}} gone into the Tempest II were incorporated into the last Tempest variant, designated as the Tempest VI. This variant was furnished with a Napier Sabre V engine with 2,340hp (1,700kW). The more powerful Sabre V required a bigger radiator which displaced the oil cooler and carburettor air intake from the radiator's centre; air for the carburettor was drawn through intakes on {{the leading edge of the}} inner wings, while the oil cooler was located behind the radiator. Most Tempest VIs were tropicalised, the main feature of this process being an air filter which was fitted in a fairing on the lower centre section. Other changes included the strengthening of the <b>rear</b> <b>spar</b> and the inclusion of spring tabs, which granted the variant superior handling performance.|$|E
50|$|The metal lattice {{gave the}} {{structure}} considerable strength, with any single stringer {{able to support}} a portion of load from {{the opposite side of}} the aircraft. Heavily damaged or destroyed beams on one side could still leave the aircraft structure viable; as a result, Wellingtons with huge areas of framework missing were often able to return home when other types would not have survived, leading to stories of the aircraft's 'invulnerability'. The effect was enhanced by the fabric skin occasionally burning off leaving the naked frames exposed. A further advantage of the geodesic construction of the wings was its enabling of a unique method for housing the fuel, with each wing containing three fuel tanks within the unobstructed space provided between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>spars</b> outboard of the engines.|$|R
2500|$|Each wing was braced from {{a single}} point on the lower {{fuselage}} pod longeron to nose and <b>rear</b> <b>spars</b> at about 40% span by an faired V-strut. [...] There were a pair of sturdy, faired, vertical struts between the upper pod and the wing centre. The pod was flat sided, with angled upper and lower surfaces and on the Storch IV projected back almost to a line between the aileron trailing edges to provide some yaw stability. On the Storch V this provided a place to mount a small DKW [...] air-cooled two-stroke engine in pusher configuration with its output shaft just lower than the wing. [...] Enclosed within a humped, metal cowling, it proved difficult to cool, so it was generally run at less than full power. [...] There was a landing skid under the pod which extended back past {{the end of the}} pod to protect the propeller.|$|R
40|$|The {{empennage}} component {{selected for}} this program is the vertical fin box of the L- 1011 aircraft. The box structure extends from the fuselage production joint to the tip rib and includes the front and <b>rear</b> <b>spars.</b> Various design options were evaluated {{to arrive at a}} configuration which would offer the highest potential for satisfying program objectives. The preferred configuration selected consists of a hat-stiffened cover with molded integrally stiffened spars, aluminum trussed composite ribs, and composite miniwich web ribs with integrally molded caps. Material screening tests were performed to select an advanced composite material system for the Advanced Composite Vertical Fin (ACFV) that would meet the program requirements from the standpoint of quality, reproducibility, and cost. Preliminary weight and cost analysis were made, targets established, and tracking plans developed. These include FAA certification, ancillary test program, quality control, and structural integrity control plans...|$|R
