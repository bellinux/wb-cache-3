40|$|AbstractGeophysical {{methods have}} been used with {{increasing}} frequency in archaeology since 1946; aerial photography has been used since 1919. The geophysical methods that are most commonly used at present are electrical resistivity, magnetic, and ground penetrating radar. Magnetometry, particularly when used in a gradient mode or with a continuously recording base station, is used at almost all sites where any geophysical methods are used. Electromagnetic soil-conductivity systems are also being increasingly used because of their very high rate of data acquisition. Less commonly used methods include self-potential, microgravity, radiometric, thermal infrared imagery, and sonic or seismic techniques.

40|$|Graduation date: 1958 Graduation date: 1958 The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to outline the {{principles}} involved in the <b>reconnaissance,</b> <b>survey,</b> and design of forest roads in the Douglas-fir Region. The <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>survey</b> {{is the most important}} element in road location. Poor reconnaissance often results in abandonment of the route at considerable expense. The ground slope affects the type of reconnaissance employed. In level country alignment controls the location of the road and grade is adapted to the topography to balance excavation and embankment quantities. In sidehill country grade controls the location of the road and alignment is adapted to the topography to balance excavation and embankment quantities. The <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>survey</b> may be separated into extensive and intensive <b>reconnaissance.</b> The extensive <b>survey</b> is the study of an area or drainage to determine the general location of the route. The intensive reconnaissance is a study of the ground adjacent of a route often involves the comparison of one or more alternatives. A preliminary survey is conducted along the final reconnaissance line to establish horizontal and vertical control and the topography {{on either side of the}} line. The precision desired determines the method of survey employed. The staff compass-tape-abney survey is the most widely used method in the Douglas-fir Region. The road is designed from the data obtained from the <b>reconnaissance</b> and preliminary <b>surveys.</b> These data are studied graphically using the plan, profile, and cross sections of the route or any combination of these graphic aids.
