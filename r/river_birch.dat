5|$|The {{area in the}} {{vicinity}} of Keyser Creek has experienced habitat loss due to abandoned mine impacts. What remains of the creek's riparian buffer in some reaches is overrun with invasive plants. The understory in the creek's riparian area is covered in knotweed.

5|$|On Germania Run, {{some parts}} of the stream have 30% to 50% canopy coverage, while others have 80% to 100% canopy coverage. Canopy cover levels are 65% on most of Little Kettle Creek. Trees growing along this creek include hemlock, <b>river</b> <b>birch,</b> beech, red maple, striped maple, and willows infested by beetles. Yellow birch, sugar maple, and hemlock trees grow on the {{tributary}} Bearfield Run.|$|E
5|$|Hemlock trees form {{a canopy}} over Big Wapwallopen Creek in some places. The Wapwallopen Gorge {{is listed as}} a Locally Significant site on the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory. Hemlock and yellow birch are common at the gorge's upper end. However, <b>river</b> <b>birch</b> and {{sycamore}} are more common {{at the lower end}} of the gorge.

The highway has four bridges, over the Sinclair River, Swan River, Woody <b>River,</b> and <b>Birch</b> <b>River.</b> The Swan River bridge is the northernmost crossing of the Swan River. The bridge was replaced in October 2012 because the old one was too narrow.|$|R
