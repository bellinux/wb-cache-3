50|$|The first {{application}} of a calciferol in <b>rodenticidal</b> <b>bait</b> was in the Sorex product Sorexa D (with a different formula than today's Sorexa D), {{back in the early}} 1970s, which contained 0.025% warfarin and 0.1% ergocalciferol. Today, Sorexa CD contains a 0.0025% difenacoum and 0.075% cholecalciferol combination. Numerous other brand products containing either 0.075-0.1% calciferols (e.g. Quintox) alone or alongside an anticoagulant are marketed.|$|E
50|$|Calciferols (vitamins D), {{cholecalciferol}} (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) {{are used}} as rodenticides. They are toxic to rodents {{for the same reason}} they are important to humans: they affect calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the body. Vitamins D are essential in minute quantities (few IUs per kilogram body weight daily, only a fraction of a milligram), and like most fat soluble vitamins, they are toxic in larger doses, causing hypervitaminosis. If the poisoning is severe enough (that is, if the dose of the toxin is high enough), it leads to death. In rodents that consume the <b>rodenticidal</b> <b>bait,</b> it causes hypercalcemia, raising the calcium level, mainly by increasing calcium absorption from food, mobilising bone-matrix-fixed calcium into ionised form (mainly monohydrogencarbonate calcium cation, partially bound to plasma proteins, CaHCO3+), which circulates dissolved in the blood plasma. After ingestion of a lethal dose, the free calcium levels are raised sufficiently that blood vessels, kidneys, the stomach wall and lungs are mineralised/calcificated (formation of calcificates, crystals of calcium salts/complexes in the tissues, damaging them), leading further to heart problems (myocardial tissue is sensitive to variations of free calcium levels, affecting both myocardial contractibility and excitation propagation between atrias and ventriculas), bleeding (due to capillary damage) and possibly kidney failure. It is considered to be single-dose, cumulative (depending on concentration used; the common 0.075% bait concentration is lethal to most rodents after a single intake of larger portions of the bait) or sub-chronic (death occurring usually within days to one week after ingestion of the bait). Applied concentrations are 0.075% cholecalciferol and 0.1% ergocalciferol when used alone, which can kill a rodent or a rat.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{evaluation}} of mouse control using tamper-proof mouse bait stations was developed and efficacy trials conducted to determine if house mice (Mus musculus) would visit and consume <b>rodenticidal</b> <b>baits</b> located within these stations. All stations were rapidly investigated by mice. Variation seen between the individual stations related to animal variation and {{did not appear to be}} related to differences in the stations themselves. Station placement was more critical to mouse investigation and subsequent bait consumption from the station than were the various features used to prohibit non-target access...|$|R
40|$|Fifteen {{experimental}} treatments with <b>rodenticidal</b> <b>baits</b> containing 0. 1, 0. 15 or 0. 2 % flupropadine {{were conducted}} on farmsteads against Rattus norvegicus infestations. Eight treatments were completely successful and the others gave kills ranging from 36 to 72 % in 28 days. Treatments with 0. 1 and 0. 15 % flupropadine were less successful against large infestations than against small ones. Flupropadine was most successful at 0. 2 % but still gave incomplete kills on farms where abundant alternative food was available. The compound was more effective than acute poisons in achieving complete control of Norway rat infestations, but was less reliable in doing so than anticoagulants. On the other hand, many flupropadine treatments gave quicker control and used smaller quantities of bait than anticoagulant treatments...|$|R
40|$|Trials of <b>rodenticidal</b> <b>baits</b> {{containing}} 50 p. p. m. difenacoum, 50 p. p. m. bromadiolone or 20 p. p. m. brodifacoum {{were carried}} out on farmsteads against populations of Rattus norvegicus containing difenacoum-resistant individuals. Six difenacoum treatments failed in 14 [...] 42 days of baiting. Two treatments with bromadiolone succeeded in 23 and 33 days, but four further treatments lasting 35 [...] 56 days failed to eradicate the populations. Brodifacoum gave virtually complete control of six populations in 21 [...] 73 days and of the ten residual populations {{left behind by the}} other two compounds, after baiting for a further 11 [...] 85 days. The performance of both bromadiolone and brodifacoum was well below that reported by previous investigators, indicating the possibility of low-grade resistance to these compounds in the difenacoum-resistant strain...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{essential}} oils of ten different plant species, at rates {{of one and}} two ml per kg of plain bait, on bait acceptance and palatability in choice feeding tests for Swiss mice was studied under controlled laboratory conditions. Our aim {{was to determine the}} possibility of use of the tested essential oils in <b>rodenticidal</b> <b>baits</b> as potential attractants at rates which prevent mould development and which are applicable in humane medicine. Also, the use of these oils would be to prolong utility value of baits and reduce the use of antifungal ingredients, which usually reduce bait acceptance. Cinnamon and anise essential oils, commonly used as attractants, and clove oil, showed the best effects, because that they did not negatively affect bait acceptance and palatability, while fenchel and bergamot oils showed repellent action which became more pronounced as the content of oil in baits increased...|$|R
