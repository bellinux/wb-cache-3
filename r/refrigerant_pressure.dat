50|$|Higher {{pressures}} are typically required to condense these new environmentally friendly refrigerants {{compared to those}} that are being phased out. Small diameter copper tubes are more desirable in applications with higher pressures. For tubes of the same thickness, smaller diameter tubes can withstand higher pressures than larger diameter tubes. Hence, as tube diameters decrease, burst pressures increase. This is because working pressure is directly proportional to wall thickness and inversely proportional to diameter. By designing coils with shorter tube lengths, less work is required to circulate the refrigerant. Therefore, <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressure</b> drop factors due to small diameter tubes can be offset.|$|E

40|$|A {{literature}} review indicates {{that almost all}} moving boundary heat exchanger models used in dynamic simulations of heat pumps rely on the common hypothesis that the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressure</b> drop is negligible. In fact, {{it is important to}} include the momentum balance in some applications, such as electronics cooling where microchannels are commonly used and significant pressure drop is observed and large-scale heat exchangers in solar thermal plants where tube length can be longer than several hundred meters. In addition, a comprehensive and robust switching approach is needed to handle transitions between different model states due to phase change. It is found that the current switching methods in the literature exhibit several shortcomings which may cause serious errors and stability issues when simulating cycling transients of vapor compression systems.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Water source {{heat pumps}} are {{increasingly}} being used for residential and commercial space heating. Typically, these heat pumps are capable of both heating and cooling, and historically the design emphasis has been on improving the units' cooling performance. Recently, there has been more interest in improving the heating performance, however, in order to optimize the design for improved heating performance data on the heat pump components operating in the heating mode are required. These data have not been available for the waterto- refrigerant heat exchangers typically installed in unitary water source heat pumps. The purpose of this work is to provide performance data on such heat exchangers operating as evaporators (data is available for the heat exchangers operating as condensers) {{and to provide a}} numerical model by which a limited amount of evaporator data might be expanded for system modeling and optimization studies. A well instrumented water-to-water heat pump was assembled for the purpose of testing two such water-to-refrigerant heat exchangers to determine their heat transfer and <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressure</b> drop characteristics as evaporators. The overall heat transfer coefficient for each of the two heat exchangers was found to be a strong function of both the water and refrigerant flow rates and a relatively weak function of the refrigerant evaporation temperature. The <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressure</b> drop was determined to be highly dependent on the refrigerant flow rate and only slightly dependent on the evaporator temperature. The overall heat transfer coefficient showed an apparent difference between parallel and counter flow conditions. This coefficient, as defined by the log-mean temperature difference, was slightly higher for the counter flow condition. A numerical model of the evaporator was developed and compared with the experimental results. The model follows a numerical solution in which the governing equations (continuity, momentum, and energy) are solved for a finite control volume and an appropriate finitedifference scheme is used to continue the solution step-wise {{along the length of the}} heat exchanger.

The {{carbon dioxide}} (R- 744) {{as a natural}} {{refrigerant}} has been an attractive alternative refrigerant to replace HFC (hydrofluorocarbon) refrigerants currently used in air conditioning systems, due to the environmental concerns. Because new compressors with CO 2 {{are going to be}} operated under the high pressure, the tribology of sliding surfaces in the compressor becomes very important. To develop new compressor, especially scroll type, the friction and wear characteristics of sliding surfaces between a fixed scroll and an orbiting scroll in the scroll compressor were investigated in this paper. The sliding tests of pin-on-disk type were carried out between scroll surfaces under various sliding speeds, normal loads, surface roughness, and <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressures.</b> Two types of lubricants were used, namely POE (polyol ester) oil and PAG (polyalkylene glycol) oil. The friction forces, wear amounts and surface temperatures were monitored during the tests. Test results showed that the wear amounts increased with increasing normal load and rotating speed, and also decreased with decreasing surface roughness. Also, the results of the sliding tests showed that using PAG oil has an advantage over POE oil in CO 2 environment. As the pressure of CO 2 refrigerant became higher, the amount of wear and coefficient of friction became larger in CO 2 /POE mixed environment, but wear and friction remained constant in CO 2 /PAG mixed environment. The wear coefficients in CO 2 /PAG and CO 2 /POE mixed environment were 8. 60 × 10 - 9 ㎣ /N·m and 2. 35 × 10 - 8 ㎣ /N·m, respectively...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTransient {{performance}} of a cascade heat pump system is experimentally investigated. The cascade heat pump consists of 4 systems: the chilled water system, the low-temperature refrigeration cycle using R 22, the high-temperature heat pump cycle using R 134 a and the hot water system. The cascade heat pump produces both chilled water for cooling application and hot water for heating application. A transient performance is observed when the hot water system is in a closed-loop operation. As the hot water temperature increases, the condensing pressure of the heat pump cycle also increases but the other <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressures</b> have marginal changes. The operation of the test rig is terminated when the condensing pressure reaches the limit of the system. The condensing pressure at high hot water flow rate increases at a lower rate than that in case of the low hot water flow rate, so the working period is higher. The compressor power of the heat pump cycle increases continuously with time whereas the compressor power of the refrigeration cycle is almost constant. The condensation heat and cooling load rapidly increase at the beginning, and the condensation heat gradually increases whereas the cooling load is almost constant. The COP of the heat pump cycle gradually decreases with time after the rapid increase at the beginning, but the COP of the refrigeration cycle is almost constant. It can be concluded that the variation of the condensing pressure of the heat pump cycle with time has a little influences to the refrigeration cycle.

40|$|The {{increased}} demand for aluminum microchannel condensers in the HVAC 2 ̆ 6 R industry imposes new challenges on the design and manufacturing processes. An aluminum microchannel heat exchanger typically contains three major components: headers, microchannel tubes and multi-louvered fins. The parts are assembled and joined together by a brazing process. To ensure high thermal performance of the brazed product, microchannel heat exchanger designers must carefully consider manufacturing {{issues related to the}} brazing process during the design stage. For example, in addition to proper sizing of the header manifolds, it is essential to determine the optimal insertion length of the microchannel tube into the header during the header/tube assembly process. An oversized header diameter not only reduces heat exchanger compactness, but also leads to increased refrigerant charge. It further increases header wall thickness requirements due to increased hoop stress. Too short of an insertion length of the microchannel tube increases the risk of overflow of liquid filler metal into the microchannels during brazing and blockage of the refrigerant passages. On the other hand, small diameter header tubes and long insertion lengths of microchannel tube may contribute to a significant increase of <b>refrigerant</b> side <b>pressure</b> drop. This paper provides both experimental and analytical studies on the influences of header geometry and microchannel tube insertion length on the heat exchanger performance, such as <b>refrigerant</b> side <b>pressure</b> drop.

The {{doctoral}} thesis at hand analyzes the characteristics {{and the potential}} of an exhaust gas heat driven jet-ejector cooling process working with R 134 a as refrigerant which is used for charge air cooling consecutive to the conventional charge air cooler of gasoline combustion engines in vehicles. The analysis focuses on the exhaust gas heat exchanger and the jet-ejector as core components of the cooling process which have been investigated separately by means of experiments and simulation. The heat flows transferable from the exhaust gases to the refrigerant are gene-rally sufficient to operate the jet-ejector cooling process almost in the entire operating range of the combustion engine. The necessary refrigerant-side conditions have been achieved in a simple heat exchanger prototype and the process may easily be controlled by the high side <b>pressure</b> of the <b>refrigerant.</b> The heat exchange at super-critical <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressures</b> can be simulated with the developed model employing the adequate corrections of the well-established Nusselt relations with an arithmetic aver-age deviation of only 4. 7 % from the experimental results. The results of the model developed for the heat exchange at subcritical <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressures</b> reproduce the experimental results satisfactorily for scope of the thesis. The down-scaling of the jet-ejector cooling process to the cooling capacity range of 1. 5 kW to 6 kW for the automotive application has been experimentally demonstrated. A sufficient temperature lift and absolute evaporation temperatures of down to - 15 °C for the continued charge air cooling have been achieved. The entrainment ratio of the jet-ejection can be calculated for a given ejector geometry dependent on the three stagnation conditions with an arithmetic aver- age deviation of 7. 8 % using a simulation model which accounts for real gas effects and allows a fit of the calculated to the experimental results {{by means of a}} loss coefficient with a clear physical meaning. The potential charge air temperatures of 12 °C to - 3 °C are adequate for improving the efficiency of gasoline engines. The additional energy consumption due to the refrigerant pump and the heat rejection demand, rather than the elevated back pressure or the additional fuel consumption due to the device's weight, may at low thermal coefficients of performance overcompensate the system's advantage.

40|$|The present {{work is a}} {{numerical}} comparative study for low GWP refrigerants based on R 161, R 152 a, R 1234 ze(e) and R 1234 yf {{as a substitute for}} R 134 a in a vapor compression refrigeration cycle under varying operating conditions. A computational model is developed by engineering equation solver software (EES). The effects of degree of subcooling, superheating, evaporating and condensing temperatures on the main performance parameters in term of mass flow rate of <b>refrigerant,</b> <b>pressure</b> ratio, volumetric cooling capacity, compressor input power and coefficient of performance are computed for selected refrigerants. The performance results are compared with respect to R 134 a. The results indicated that the coefficient of performance for R 152 a is slightly better than the other refrigerants under various operating conditions. The refrigerant R 1234 ze(e) has approximately the same COP and VCC of R 134 a and it has the lowest compressor input power and TEWI value over the four compared low GWP refrigerants...|$|E

The apparent deviation of a basic component involved a four inch regulating valve that would not fully close during post installation calibration. The regulating valve is used to control essential chilled water system chiller <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressure.</b> APS completed the required evaluation based on inspections by the supplier, Flowserve US, Inc. The evaluation concluded the regulating valve would not fully close during calibration because the valve stem guide had become dislodged from the normal installed position. This is postulated to have occurred {{as a result of a}} fluid pressure surge inside the valve caused by incomplete venting of the valve prior to initiating water flow through the valve during calibration. Since the inability of the regulating valve to fully close during calibration resulted from maintenance activities during valve installation, no deviation in a A member of the STAR...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} for calculation of refrigerant {{mass flow rate}} is implemented in the distributed numerical model to simulate the flow in finned-tube coil dry-expansion evaporators, usually found in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems. Two-phase refrigerant flow inside the tubes {{is assumed to be}} one-dimensional, unsteady, and homogeneous. In the model the effects of <b>refrigerant</b> <b>pressure</b> drop and the moisture condensation from the air flowing over the external surface of the tubes are considered. The results obtained are the distributions of refrigerant velocity, temperature and void fraction, tube-wall temperature, air temperature, and absolute humidity. The finite volume method is used to discretize the governing equations. Additionally, given the operation conditions and the geometric parameters, the model allows the calculation of the refrigerant mass flow rate. The value of mass flow rate is computed using the process of parameter estimation with the minimization method of Levenberg-Marquardt minimization. In order to validate the developed model, the obtained results using HFC- 134 a as a refrigerant are compared with available data from the literature. </p...|$|E

The cycle is modelled for the carbon-ammonia pair, but {{could be used for}} any high <b>pressure</b> <b>refrigerant.</b> Mean heat output when used as a heat pump is of the order of kilowatts per kg of adsorbent. Heat pumping COPs of about 1. 3 are predicted for the situation modelled, but the regenerative nature of the cycle gives rise to the belief that COPs up to a maximum of 1. 9 may be possible with optimised energy management within the system...|$|R

Increasing the pipeline diameter may have incidence on the oil circulation and affect the gas compressor. A column of <b>refrigerant</b> creating weight <b>pressure</b> in the liquid line can be a solution for flash-gas, but may have incidence in the expansion and evaporation. If the evaporator floods and liquid arrives to the gas compressor, serious complications will show up, most likely destroying the compressor (especially if the compressor is below the level of the receiver).|$|R
40|$|A new {{experimental}} apparatus {{has recently}} been set up at the Dipartimento di Fisica Tecnica of the University of Padova. Condensation tests for several refrigerants were conducted inside a smooth tube by directly measuring the wall temperature in the test section. The experimental runs to measure the heat transfer coefficients were carried out at an average saturation temperature of 40 °C at mass velocities ranging from 100 to 750 kg/(m 2 s), over the entire vapour quality range. The refrigerants used in the tests include HCFC 22 and HFC 134 a. The experimental data was compared to the best known correlations for heat transfer prediction during condensation of refrigerants and showed good agreement. Condensation tests were also conducted on nearly azeotropic mixtures (R- 410 A) and zeotropic mixtures (R- 407 C, R- 125 / 236 ea (45 / 55)). Pressure drop data is also collected for the same <b>refrigerants.</b> Experimental <b>pressure</b> losses and comparisons with the models are shown here for R- 22...|$|R
