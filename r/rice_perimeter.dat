40|$|Agricultural activities, {{among other}} factors, can {{influence}} the transmission of malaria. In two villages of central Cote d'Ivoire (Tiemelekro and Zatta) with distinctively different agro-ecological characteristics, we assessed Plasmodium prevalence rates, fever and clinically confirmed malaria episodes among children aged 15 years and below by means of repeated cross-sectional surveys. Additionally, presumptive malaria cases were monitored in dispensaries for a 4 -year period. In Tiemelekro, we observed a decrease in malaria prevalence rates from 2002 to 2005, which might be partially explained by changes in agricultural activities from subsistence farming to cash crop production. In Zatta, where an irrigated <b>rice</b> <b>perimeter</b> is located {{in close proximity to}} human habitations, malaria prevalence rates in 2003 were significantly lower than in 2002 and 2005, which coincided with the interruption of irrigated rice farming in 2003 / 2004. Although malaria transmission differed by an order of magnitude in the two villages in 2003, there was no statistically significant difference between the proportions of severe malaria episodes (i. e. axillary temperature< 37. 5 degrees C plus parasitaemia< 5000 parasites/mul blood). Our study underscores the complex relationship between malaria transmission, prevalence rate and the dynamics of malaria episodes. A better understanding of local contextual determinants, including the effect of agricultural activities, will help to improve the local epidemiology and control of malari...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLake Alaotra is {{the largest}} lake in Madagascar (456 km 2). It is {{surrounded}} by marshland and irrigated perimeters of great economic value forming the “main rice granary” of the country. The basin also has an heritage and ecological value as a wetland protected by the Ramsar Convention (1971) and {{is home to a}} number of threatened endemic species. In reality the “lake” is just a vast shallow pool that seems doomed to silt up as the surrounding basin is affected by very strong erosion, the marks of which {{can be seen in the}} landscape ("lavaka" or "tevana"). If Lake Alaotra is a transitional form destined to disappear, the question remains of how fast this will happen. In spite of repeated cries of alarm in the Malagasy media and also a few scientific affirmations, the silting up of the lake is not obvious. In a first approach, a critical analysis of arguments backing the hypothesis of rapid sedimentation in the lake is addressed. Subsequently, new data collected highlight the processes that effectively limit sedimentation, ranked from upstream to downstream these are: sand deposits by the overflows into the lacustrine plain, buffering by the aquatic vegetation in the marshes, resuspension of fine particles by wind and waves and their discharge related to currents and a probable subsidence. Significant sedimentation in the lake itself has not been shown, quite the opposite. Finally, local planning options are discussed. Priority must be given to improved land management in the catchment which affects both the large <b>rice</b> <b>perimeters</b> and the lake itself...|$|R
40|$|Pesticide {{impacts on}} the marine {{environment}} in the Dominican Republic, although suspected by many, are difficult to prove scientifically. It {{is likely that the}} present cultivation of <b>rice</b> around the <b>perimeter</b> of Samana Bay results in run-off of pesticides into unique coastal marine ecosystems. The high cost of pesticide use in rice along with the development of Integrated Pest Management techniques for rice in other countries offers a unique opportunity to develop nonchemical agriculture in the country's number one pesticide-consuming crop. Dominican organizations who can contribute significantly to this project have been identified...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe 'territory' {{concept is}} {{addressed}} at a scale rarely envisaged—that {{of the plot}} —through the study of a large <b>rice</b> irrigation <b>perimeter</b> {{in the heart of}} the Lake Alaotra region in Madagascar. The methodology fol-lowed in this study relies on the processing of landholding inventories. These inventories are remarquable, first for their quality, as they are at the same time quantitative and mapped (GIS-based inventories). They also allow long-term trend analyses inasmuch as they take place for a long period of time, from 1970 to 2012. Results of this study consist in two different conclusions: first, an obvious trend for the fragmen-tation (division) of plots and the decrease in the size of holdings is identified, though this fragmentation is not equal everywhere. These results confirm the general trend observed in lake Alaotra region and in Madagascar regarding land pressure and fragmentation due to demographic and other socio-cultural fac-tors. Second, fragmentation dynamics hides other less perceptible landholding phenomena. Specifically, it masks land grabbing by new and enterprising rice growers who increase their holdings by profiting from the problems experienced by the smallest farm owners whose fragmented land is no longer viable...|$|R
