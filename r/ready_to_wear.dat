5|$|Woodall and Susannah Constantine first collaborated in 1996 on <b>Ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>Wear,</b> {{a weekly}} style guide for The Daily Telegraph which ran for seven years. The style guide {{highlighted}} affordable high-street fashion, with the pair using themselves to demonstrate clothing that suited different figures. Woodall assumed {{the role of}} stylist and made the duo's business decisions. She and Constantine later became co-founders of Ready2shop.com, a dot-com fashion advice business. The business dissolved in July 2001.|$|E
5|$|Woodall's {{first chance}} to work on {{television}} came about when Granada Sky Broadcasting signed her and Constantine to host a daytime shopping show, also called <b>Ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>Wear.</b> Soon after their television debut, {{they were given a}} recurring makeover slot on Richard & Judy. This gained them crucial exposure and attention from Jane Root, controller of BBC Two, who signed them to the channel encouraged by their tenacity and their book and internet business.|$|E

The book was unsuccessful and resulted in the pulping of 13,000 copies. Soon {{after the start of}} their television career, they secured a frequent makeover slot on the show Richard & Judy. It ensured that they had further exposure in television and gained attention from Jane Root, controller of BBC Two, who took a risk and signed them up after their book venture and their internet business had failed badly.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the birth}} of their two children, Oliver and Eloise; in 1977 the couple {{launched}} their own fashion house, Emanuel Salon, in Brook Street, Mayfair. In 1979, they decided <b>to</b> close their <b>ready</b> - <b>to</b> - <b>wear</b> shop, so that they could concentrate on the couture (custom made) side of the business, and became a favourite designer of Lady Diana Spencer before her marriage.|$|R
5|$|In 1994, {{she first}} met Trinny Woodall {{at a party}} hosted by David, Viscount Linley. Though they did not like each other at first, the two women {{proceeded}} to write <b>Ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>Wear,</b> a weekly style guide for The Daily Telegraph which ran successfully for seven years. The column promoted affordable high-street fashion and they used themselves to illustrate which clothing suited which figure. Constantine and Woodall also became the co-founders of Ready2shop.com, a dot-com, but the business venture failed, and investors subsequently lost a reputed £10 million.|$|E
25|$|After {{taking over}} Norton in 2005, Grant has been {{credited}} with rejuvenating the once ailing business. He relaunched E. Tautz & Sons as a <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> label in 2009, {{for which he was}} awarded the Menswear Designer award at the British Fashion Awards in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine {{teamed up}} in 1994 to write <b>Ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>Wear,</b> a weekly style {{guide for the}} Daily Telegraph which ran for seven years. They had {{previously}} met {{at a dinner party}} hosted by David, Viscount Linley but did not actually like each other at first. They both perceived each other in negative ways: Woodall looked upon Constantine as if she was a stuck-up English aristocrat and Constantine saw Woodall as 'Eurotrash'.|$|E
25|$|A young Faroese {{person is}} {{normally}} handed down {{a set of}} children's Faroese clothes that have passed from generation to generation. Children are confirmed at age 14, and normally start to collect the pieces to make an adult outfit, which is considered as a rite of passage. Traditionally the aim {{would have been to}} complete the outfit by the time a young person was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> marry and <b>wear</b> the clothes at the ceremony—though it is mainly only men who do this now.|$|R
5000|$|Capstan {{wear and}} buildup. As tape residue, dirt and {{lubricant}} built {{up on the}} capstan, the tape speed would increase and, since the buildup was uneven, the tape speed would become correspondingly uneven. Similarly, some units were subject <b>to</b> the capstan <b>wear,</b> causing a decrease in tape speed. Technicians routinely kept a supply of new capstans on hand <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> install into <b>worn</b> decks for this reason, during {{the heyday of the}} format. Once the capstan wears only [...]001" [...] the tape speed slows. Replacing or resurfacing the capstan would restore operation. The old [...] "matchpack" [...] or [...] "matchbook" [...] under the tape fix while playing, was done primarily because the capstan was worn or polished, and would no longer grip the tape and play it at the correct speed. Replacing or resurfacing the capstan, restores proper operation without using a wedge under the tape.|$|R
60|$|But while Mrs. Treat was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> {{believe that}} her costume might be {{reasonably}} fit <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>to</b> a dinner party, {{she was certain}} that something more than tights {{and a pair of}} short, red velvet trousers was necessary for her husband.|$|R
25|$|Noten's design I Am Being Nice to My Colleagues (2001) {{consists}} of an A4 silver plate that is blank except for two indented concentric circles. This first ring is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear.</b> When the buyer wishes {{to have a new}} ring made, they can commission another designer to create another ring from the plate. Eventually only the silhouettes of previous rings will be left. Noten invites other designers to share his concept and create their own work within the concept's parameters.|$|E
500|$|Constantine {{was born}} into a wealthy family; her father was {{successful}} in property and shipping sectors. [...] She was privately educated as a child and went on to date British royalty, David, Viscount Linley, during the 1980s. [...] Constantine has been involved in fashion for a long period, originally working in America for Giorgio Armani and then John Galliano in London. [...] She met Trinny Woodall in 1994, with whom she both proceeded to write a weekly fashion column, <b>Ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>Wear.</b> They founded Ready2shop.com, a dot-com fashion advice business, and wrote their first fashion advice book in 2000, Ready 2 Dress, both of which failed. [...] From there they were commissioned to BBC Two to host the style series, What Not to Wear, from 2001 to 2005. [...] She made regular appearances as a style advisor on The Oprah Winfrey Show and following her success on the shows, she went on to co-host Trinny & Susannah Undress... on ITV in 2006 and Undress the Nation in 2007. [...] Constantine and Woodall have now dressed over 5,000 women.|$|E
2500|$|While {{continuing}} to present Fashion TV's [...] "Shop The World" [...] programme and to design couture clothing, David Emanuel designed his first <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> bridal collection, for Berketex Brides, in 2008.

60|$|The hypocrites, in {{perpetual}} tears, walked {{about in a}} wearisome and exhausted manner, as if <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> faint. They <b>wore</b> huge cowls, which hung over their eyes, and the outsides of which were gilded, but the insides of lead. Two {{of them had been}} rulers of Florence; and Dante was listening to their story, when his attention was called off by the sight of a cross, on which Caiaphas the High Priest was writhing, breathing hard all the while through his beard with sighs. It was his office to see that every soul which passed him, on its arrival in the place, was oppressed with the due weight. His father-in-law, Annas, and all his council, were stuck in like manner on crosses round the borders of the gulf. The pilgrims beheld little else in this region of weariness, and soon passed into the borders {{of one of the most}} terrible portions of Evil-budget, the land of the transformation of Robbers.|$|R
2500|$|Grant relaunched the defunct Norton {{subsidiary}} E. Tautz & Sons in 2009 as a <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> brand. In {{recognition for}} his work with Tautz, he was awarded as Menswear Designer of 2010 at the British Fashion Awards. The label is a large component of the Norton business, with particular success in Asia. The label {{tends to be more}} experimental than the Norton line, with Grant explaining that with Tautz [...] "We don't need to be wedded too much to the idea of the tailored suit." ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, a remix of [...] "Keep Givin' Me Your Love" [...] was popularized on the {{original}} motion picture soundtrack of the Prêt-à-Porter (<b>Ready</b> <b>To</b> <b>Wear)</b> film, and released in the U.S. after a one-year delay, scoring No. 4 in the US Dance charts in March 1995. [...] "Keep Givin' Me Your Love" [...] became Peniston's first song not to enter the Hot 100 chart (No. 101), possibly {{as the result of}} appearing as a B-side on her previous release, and sharing its sales with the single [...] "Hit by Love".|$|E

2500|$|They {{later became}} the co-founders of Ready2shop.com, a dot-com fashion advice {{business}} which ceased trading after running out of funding in November 2000, losing investors a reputed £10million. During this period, their friendship was almost ended after a heated argument. They later gained their first chance at working on television when Granada Sky Broadcasting signed them up to host a daytime shopping show, also called <b>Ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>Wear.</b> They published their first fashion advice book called Ready 2 Dress {{but it was an}} unsuccessful venture and ended in 13,000 copies of the book being destroyed.

60|$|They {{even went}} so far, {{some of those who}} thought it more the part of a man <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> silks than build himself a house, as to steal matchlocks, pistols, and weapons of any kind, {{standing}} <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> teach the savages how to use these things, if thereby they were given so much additional in the way of food.|$|R
60|$|It was queer enough, to be sure, to {{hear this}} little chap--this rosy-cheeked, ten-year-old boy--talking about schemes for the public benefit! Nevertheless, his companions were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> listen, being assured that Ben's scheme, {{whatever}} it was, would be well worth their attention. They remembered how sagaciously he had conducted all their enterprises ever since he had been old enough <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> small-clothes.|$|R
60|$|Gilbert was called, and {{the result}} was more {{satisfactory}} than Albinia thought that Genevieve deserved. His frenzy had tended <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> itself out, and he had been so dreadfully alarmed about India and his father, that in his relief, gratitude, and fear of being sent out, he was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> promise anything. Before his father he could go into no rhapsodies, and could only be miserably confused.|$|R

60|$|But if {{the wisdom}} of Comte was insufficient, the folly of Comte was wisdom. In an age of dusty modernity, when beauty was thought of as {{something}} barbaric and ugliness as something sensible, he alone saw that men must always have the sacredness of mummery. He saw that while the brutes have all the useful things, {{the things that are}} truly human are the useless ones. He saw the falsehood of that almost universal notion of to-day, the notion that rites and forms are something artificial, additional, and corrupt. Ritual is really much older than thought; it is much simpler and much wilder than thought. A feeling touching the nature of things does not only make men feel that there are certain proper things to say; it makes them feel that there are certain proper things to do. The more agreeable of these consist of dancing, building temples, and shouting very loud; the less agreeable, of wearing green carnations and burning other philosophers alive. But everywhere the religious dance came before the religious hymn, and man was a ritualist before he could speak. If Comtism had spread the world would have been converted, not by the Comtist philosophy, but by the Comtist calendar. By discouraging what they conceive to be the weakness of their master, the English Positivists have broken the strength of their religion. A man who has faith must be prepared not only to be a martyr, but to be a fool. It is absurd to say that a man is ready to toil and die for his convictions when he is not even <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> a wreath round his head for them. I myself, to take a corpus vile, am very certain that I would not read the works of Comte through for any consideration whatever. But I can easily imagine myself with the greatest enthusiasm lighting a bonfire on Darwin Day.|$|E

60|$|After dinner, Mrs. Golden {{was always}} <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> do {{whatever}} Una wished--to play cribbage, or read aloud, or {{go for a}} walk--not a long walk; she was so delicate, you know, but a nice little walk with her dear, dear daughter....

But {{she did not like}} to have Una go out and leave her, nor have naughty, naughty men like Walter take Una to the theater, as though they wanted to steal the dear daughter away. And she wore Una's few good frocks, and forgot to freshen them in time for Una <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> them. Otherwise, Mrs. Golden had the unselfishness of a saint on a marble pillar.|$|R
