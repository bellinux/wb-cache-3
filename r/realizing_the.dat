5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. <b>Realizing</b> <b>the</b> limitations of the current stage of thinking {{is the driving force}} behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E

In mid December the two Jurchen armies converged on Kaifeng for the second time that year.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2002, DiCaprio {{appeared}} in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York, a historical film {{set in the}} mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City. Director Scorsese initially struggled selling his idea of <b>realizing</b> <b>the</b> film until DiCaprio became interested in playing protagonist Amsterdam Vallon, a young leader of the Irish faction, and thus, Miramax Films got involved with financing the project. Nonetheless production on the film was plagued by blown-out budgets and producer-director squabbles, resulting in a marathon eight-month shoot and, at US$103 million, the most expensive film Scorsese had ever made. Upon its release, Gangs of New York became a financial and critical success. DiCaprio's acting was well-received but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis' performance among most critics.|$|E

40|$|By using a twin-core fiber (TCF), {{we propose}} and {{demonstrate}} a novel distributed SPR sensor, which employs both the {{time division multiplexing}} (TDM) technology and the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology together.

We employ the TDM technology to <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> two passage distributed sensing, which are parallel-connection; and we employ the WDM technology to <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> distributed sensing of two channels in a sensing passage, which are series-connected. In order to <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> TDM technology, we employ a two-core fiber, which has two cores in a same cladding, being equal to dividing the traditional single core into two independent sensing zones; in order to <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> WDM technology, we employ a fiber end polishing-connecting method to adjust the resonance angle/wavelength to <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> dynamic range separation.
