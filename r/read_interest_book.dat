40|$|As {{literacy}} educators, we have {{a tendency}} to use mostly fiction books as our chief source of materials for motivating the reading habits of our students. When we examine children's <b>reading</b> <b>interests</b> and the <b>books</b> they choose for their independent reading, we discover that many children enjoy, and even prefer, to read information books. Coupled with students' strong <b>interests</b> in information <b>books</b> is the growing selection of quality children's information books available in today's school's libraries. This article explores the rationale for balancing the use of information books in literacy programs with a focus on how we can use information books to encourage and motivate girls and boys to do more independent reading. Ideas for practical applications of this rationale for both classroom teachers and school librarians are provided in the hope that all elementary literacy teachers will start using more information books to motivate their young readers...|$|R

The Fred Forbat Book Collection is one of nearly 250 architects' collections donated to or otherwise acquired by the Swedish Museum of Architecture. The Forbat Collection mainly consists of literature on architecture and housing questions in Germany during the 1920 s and 1930 s, which reflects the early Functionalistic period in Europe.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relationship of each of the variables of age, sex, reading -achievement, intelligence, and reading attitude to the preferred <b>reading</b> <b>interests</b> of students in grades four, five, and six. The following information and resources were available for each subject in this study: 1. Age 2. Sex 3. A reading achievement score 4. An intelligence quotient 5. A parent consent formThe population of this study consisted of two hundred sixty-nine (269) students in grades four, five, and six from the Muncie Community School Corporation. All students completed the Readinq Interest Survey, and seventy (70) of these students were interviewed utilizing the Reading Interest Student Interview Guide. The Reading Interest Survey consisted of two sections. The first section contained thirty-nine (39) questions describing books in different categories, while the second section consisted of fifteen (15) statements about reading. For the first section the students were asked to select one of the following choices to indicate their feelings about reading a book like each one described: "very much," "some," "little," or "not at all. " For the second section the students were asked to select one of the following choices to indicate their feelings about each statement concerning reading: "strongly agree," "agree," "undecided," "disagree," or "strongly disagree. "The Reading Interest Student Interview Guide was designed to cover the same areas of interest included in the Readinq Interest Survey. Also, other types of questions were included to find out more about students' attitudes toward reading. An attempt was made to put the students at ease through discussion of their general interests at the beginning of the interview sessions. They were told there were no right or wrong answers but that their judgments were needed. As the students responded, their comments were recorded so important information could be retained. At the conclusion of the study, the data collected from the Reading Interest Survey were examined. Analysis of variance was used to test the data. Pertinent information gathered from student interviews was reported. The identification of variables indicating the preferred <b>reading</b> <b>interests</b> in the two subsets of books about people and books about science used in the Reading Interest Survey is reviewed as follows: 1. For books about people the most interest was shown by boys, age twelve; students with above average intelligence quotients, high reading achievement scores, and average reading attitude scores. 2. For books about science the most interest was shown by girls, age twelve; students with above average intelligence quotients, high reading achievement scores, and average reading attitude scores. 3. For books about people the least interest was shown by girls, age nine; students with below average intelligence quotients, low reading achievement scores, and fair reading attitude scores. 4. For books about science the least interest was shown by boys, age thirteen; students with below average intelligence quotients, low reading achievement scores, and fair reading attitude scores.

A multi-method design was adapted to assess L 2 reading strategy use and L 2 <b>reading</b> <b>interest.</b> The assessment methods for strategy use included think-aloud protocols and a L 2 reading strategy questionnaire, the Cognitive-Metacognitive Strategy Questionnaire. To quantify the data from the think-aloud protocols, three scoring procedures were developed based on the frequency counts of the strategy coding system: (1) Quantity of Total Strategy Use, (2) Quality of Total Strategy Use and (3) Sophistication of Strategy Use. In addition, the readers' <b>reading</b> <b>interest</b> was measured by semi-structural interviews and two interest scales: the Situational Interest Questionnaire and the Interest Experience Scale. Based on the multiple assessments with 36 participants, the study examined (1) the specific L 2 reading strategies employed by eighth graders in Taiwan and how the results from different strategy assessments corresponded to each other, (2) the sources for L 2 <b>reading</b> <b>interest</b> for the eighth graders, and (3) how L 2 reading strategy use and <b>reading</b> <b>interest</b> interacted with each other to influence L 2 reading comprehension. The results indicated that the L 2 readers utilized three clusters of reading strategies during comprehension: (1) textbase comprehension strategies, such as translation and paraphrasing, (2) situation model construction strategies, such as elaboration, summarization and drawing inferences, and (3) metacognitive monitoring strategies. The study also found that the measure, Sophistication of Strategy Use, had the most satisfactory validity among the strategy measures. The degree of sophistication in strategy use was more associated with the readers' text recalls than the quantity of total strategy use, indicating how the readers intentionally and carefully processed each strategy played a significant role to improve reading comprehension. Moreover, the study found several content characteristics which had positive influences on L 2 readers' interest in the text; they were relevance, importance, novelty and familiarity of the ideas contained in the text. Furthermore, the case analyses on three readers' profiles showed that <b>reading</b> <b>interest</b> was closely related to the depth of the readers' strategic engagement. The less proficient L 2 reader, Alice, possessed high <b>reading</b> <b>interest</b> and demonstrated an attempt to employ more higher-order, situation model construction strategies during reading. By contrast, the proficient L 2 reader, Stella, did not intend to comprehend the text in depth and utilized the strategies at the superficial level due to low <b>reading</b> <b>interest.</b> These findings presented a dynamic picture of the intertwined relationship between strategy use and <b>reading</b> <b>interest</b> in L 2 reading comprehension...|$|R
