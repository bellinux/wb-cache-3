However, {{there is a limit}} to molecular size and shape difference in mixtures where the intermolecular repulsion can be represented by hard sphere mixture. A HCB equation of state developed by Naumann and Leland (1984) is applicable to pure components and their mixtures. The HCB equation of state for a pure component is characterized by two dimensionless geometrical parameters, α and τ- 1, which are combinations of three molecular dimensions of a convex body [...] volume(V), surface area(S), and mean radius(R). Two dimensionless geometrical parameters are determined directly from Pitzer's acentric factor. The molecular volume is evaluated by equating the HCB equation of state to the optimal repulsion evaluated by the expansion method. The surface area and the mean radius are obtained from known dimensionless geometrical parameters and molecular volume. Four kinds of convex bodies are considered in this work. These are prolate spherocylinders, oblate spherocylinders, prolate ellipsoids, and oblate ellipsoids. Better results for the vapor-liquid equilibrium constants (K-values) for mixtures containing molecules as nonspherical as n-decane in the prolate models and cyclohexane in the oblate models are obtained with this method than with ordinary equations of state using empirical mixing rules.

30|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of each nanofluid {{was measured using}} a liquid metal transient hot-wire device. The transient hot-wire method has been used successfully in our laboratory to measure the {{thermal conductivity}} of electrically conducting liquids [23] and nanofluids [10 – 14] over {{a broad range of}} temperatures. Our transient hot-wire device consists of a glass capillary, filled with mercury, and suspended vertically in the nanoparticle dispersion in a cylindrical glass cell. The glass capillary insulates the mercury 'wire' from the electrically conducting dispersion, and prevents current leakage when a voltage is applied to the 'wire'. The 'wire' is heated by application of a voltage and its resistance is measured using a Wheatstone bridge circuit with the 'wire' forming one arm of the circuit. The temperature change of the wire is computed from the resistance change of the mercury 'wire' with time. The data are used to calculate the effective thermal conductivity of the nanofluid via an analytical solution of Fourier's equation for a linear heat source of infinite length in an infinite medium. This solution predicts a linear relationship between the temperature change of the wire and the natural log of time, and this is used to confirm that the primary mode of heat transfer during the measurement is conduction. Corrections to the temperature are included for the insulating layer around the wire, the finite dimensions of the wire, the finite volume of the fluid, and heat loss due to radiation. The thermal conductivity is obtained from the slope of the corrected temperature-time line using the length of the mercury 'wire' in the calculation. An effective length of the wire that corrects for non-uniform capillary thickness and end effects is obtained by calibration with two <b>reference</b> <b>fluids.</b> In the present study, water and dimethyl phthalate were used as the <b>reference</b> <b>fluids</b> [24] and their properties were obtained from the literature [25].

40|$|When process {{equipment}} such as separation units, heat pumps, and refrigeration systems are simulated or designed, physico-chemical properties of the fluids involved must be known. The outcome of the simulation or design depends on {{the accuracy of the}} correlations used in the prediction of physico-chemical data, so it is of the utmost importance that the correlations used correctly describe the properties of the fluids. Owing to the phasing out of the CFCs, the need for reliable thermodynamic data for the replacement fluids has increased rapidly. Today there is a search for both experimental data and equations that correctly describe the thermodynamic properties of the possible replacement fluids. The purpose of this work was to develop accurate tools for the prediction of thermodynamic properties of refrigerants, especially for those refrigerants (HFCs) that are suggested as replacements for the ozone-depleting refrigerants (CFCs) previously used. Compound-specific parameters have been determined in the Lee-Kesler equation of state for the refrigerants CFC 12, HFC 32, HFC 125, and HFC 134 a. Experimental data used in the parameter estimation were: pressure-volume-temperature data at subcooled and superheated conditions, vapour pressure, saturated liquid and vapour molar volumes, speed of sound, second virial coefficient, and heat capacities. Errors in both dependent and independent variables were accounted for during the parameter estimation. Properties predicted with the compound-specific equations of state thus obtained agree well with experimental data.

On {{the basis of the}} three-parameter CS model form of Teja et al for volumetric properties, the reduced viscosity of a third fluid of the family is obtained in reduced pressure and temperature. A new scaling factor is assumed to replace the Pitzer acentric factor as a third parameter; it is generated from saturated-liquid-viscosity experimental data. These are then the only model inputs, allowing the model to calculate viscosity predictively over the whole pressure, density, temperature (p, r, T) domain. The conversion of the independent variables from (p, T) to(r, T), necessary only for the <b>reference</b> <b>fluids,</b> is obtained through volumetric-dedicated equations of state. The model is here applied to hydrocarbons and hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants, including fluoropropanes, with a prediction accuracy comparable with those of the reference fluid equations.

For these standards the viscosity tables have been extended up to 1000 bar in the temperature range of 20 to 120 °C.

Surface tension of body fluids correlates directly to the development of pathological states. Methods: In this review, the variety of human diseases mediated by the surface tension changes of biological phenomena and the failure of biological fluids to remain in their native state are discussed. Results: Dynamic surface tension measurements of human biological fluids depend on various parameters such as sex, age and changes during pregnancy or certain disease.

The objectives of this study were to investigate within stirred vessels the effects of thixotropy and viscoelasticity, separately, in the absence of other rheological behaviours for the fluids examined.

From this analysis, we demonstrate that the Dzugutov scheme can be applied successfully if a self-consistent method to determine the packing fraction of the hard sphere <b>reference</b> <b>fluid</b> is used as well as the Carnahan-Starling approach to express the excess entropy...|$|R
40|$|We derive an {{expression}} for the chemical potential of an associating solute in a solvent {{relative to the}} value in a <b>reference</b> <b>fluid</b> using the quasichemical organization of the potential distribution theorem. The fraction of times the solute is not associated with the solvent, the monomer fraction, is {{expressed in terms of}} (a) the statistics of occupancy of the solvent around the solute in the <b>reference</b> <b>fluid</b> and (b) the Widom factors that arise because of turning on solute-solvent association. Assuming pair-additivity, we expand the Widom factor into a product of Mayer f-functions and the resulting expression is rearranged to reveal a form of the monomer fraction that is analogous to that used within the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT). The present formulation avoids all graph-theoretic arguments and provides a fresh, more intuitive, perspective on Wertheim’s theory and SAFT. Importantly, multi-body effects are transparently incorporated into the very foundations of the theory. We illustrate the generality of the present approach by considering examples of multiple solvent association to a colloid solute with bonding domains that range from a small patch on the sphere to a Janus particle to a solute whose entire surface is available for association...|$|R
40|$|A second-order Taylor series {{expansion}} of the free energy functional provides analytical expressions for the magnetic field dependence of the free energy and of the magnetization of ferrofluids, here modelled by dipolar Yukawa interaction potentials. The corresponding hard core dipolar Yukawa <b>reference</b> <b>fluid</b> is studied {{within the framework of}} the mean spherical approximation. Our findings for the magnetic and phase equilibrium properties are in quantitative agreement with previously published and new Monte Carlo simulation data. Comment: 8 pages including 4 figure...|$|R
