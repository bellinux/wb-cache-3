5|$|The accused had {{no right}} of appeal.

5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Cervus (and hence early <b>relatives</b> <b>or</b> {{possible}} ancestors of the elk) first appear in the fossil record 25 million years ago, during the Oligocene in Eurasia, but do {{not appear in the}} North American fossil record until the early Miocene. The extinct Irish elk (Megaloceros) was not a member {{of the genus}} Cervus, but rather the largest member of the wider deer family (Cervidae) known from the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|According to American {{psychiatrist}} Oleg Lapshin, Russia until 1993 did {{not have}} any specific legislation in the field of mental health except uncoordinated instructions and articles of laws in criminal and administrative law, orders of the USSR Ministry of Health. In the Soviet Union, any psychiatric patient could be hospitalized by request of his headman, <b>relatives</b> <b>or</b> instructions of a district psychiatrist. In this case, patient's consent or dissent mattered nothing. The duration of treatment in a psychiatric hospital also depended entirely on the psychiatrist. All of that made the abuse of psychiatry possible to suppress those who opposed the political regime, and that created the vicious practice of ignoring the rights of the mentally ill.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{relationships}} of millipede orders are still the subject of debate, the class Diplopoda {{as a whole is}} considered a monophyletic group of arthropods: all millipedes are more closely related to each other than to any other arthropods. Diplopoda is a class within of the arthropod subphylum Myriapoda, the myriapods, which includes centipedes (class Chilopoda) as well as the lesser-known pauropods (class Pauropoda) and symphylans (class Symphyla). Within myriapods, the closest <b>relatives</b> <b>or</b> sister group of millipedes has long been considered the pauropods, which also have a collum and diplosegments.|$|E
5|$|Aristocratic Heian women lived {{restricted}} and secluded lives, {{allowed to}} speak to men only when they were close <b>relatives</b> <b>or</b> household members. Murasaki's autobiographical poetry shows that she socialized with women but had limited contact with men other than her father and brother; she often exchanged poetry with women but never with men. Unlike most noblewomen of her status, she did not marry on reaching puberty; instead she stayed in her father's household until her mid-twenties or perhaps even to her early thirties.|$|E
5|$|Corpses {{thought to}} be vampires were {{generally}} described as having a healthier appearance than expected, plump and showing little or no signs of decomposition. In some cases, when suspected graves were opened, villagers even described the corpse as having fresh blood from a victim all over its face. Evidence that a vampire was active in a given locality included death of cattle, sheep, <b>relatives</b> <b>or</b> neighbours. Folkloric vampires could also make their presence felt by engaging in minor poltergeist-like activity, such as hurling stones on roofs or moving household objects, and pressing on people in their sleep.|$|E

5|$|Evolution {{influences}} {{every aspect}} of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other, usually by aiding their <b>relatives</b> <b>or</b> engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.|$|E
5|$|Since {{he died at}} a {{relatively}} early age and his wife died shortly after him, his orphaned children were forced to live with other <b>relatives</b> <b>or</b> fend for themselves. Martha married Judge Charles H. Constable; together they looked after many of her younger siblings until they married or found work. Her brother Charles Hinde became a successful businessman and riverboat captain. One of Captain Hinde's accomplishments was investing in the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, California. Hinde's grandson, Frederick Zimmerman, built the Grand Rapids Hotel on the Hinde family farm in Mount Carmel near the Grand Rapids Dam and Hanging Rock.|$|E
5|$|Gross {{salary was}} subject to {{deductions}} for food, clothing, boots and hay (probably for the company mules). It is unclear whether the cost of armour and weapons was also deducted, or borne by the army. Deductions left the soldier with a net salary of 78 denarii. This sum was sufficient, {{on the basis of}} the food deduction, to amply feed an adult for a year. In 84AD Domitian increased basic legionary pay by 33% (from 225 to 300 denarii): a similar increase was presumably accorded to auxiliaries, boosting their net income to 140 denarii, i.e. more than two food allowances. It was entirely disposable, as the soldier was exempt from the poll tax (capitatio), did not pay rent (he was housed in fort barracks) and his food, clothing and equipment were already deducted. It should be borne in mind that most recruits came from peasant families living at subsistence level. To such persons, any disposable income would appear attractive. It could be spent on leisure activities, sent to <b>relatives</b> <b>or</b> simply saved for retirement.|$|E

5|$|Guy B., born 1862, first {{worked as}} a seaman. By 1900, he was married with several {{children}} and {{worked as a}} salesman. His youngest daughter was named Antoinette. In 1850, the senior Smith's household included four older women: Lavinia Smith, age 67 (his mother: b. c.1783 - d. bet.1860-1870), born in South Carolina and listed first as head of household; Sarah Williams, 57; Amelia Jones, 47; and Mary Hewlitt, 53, who were likely <b>relatives</b> <b>or</b> friends. By then Smith and his wife Malvina had three children: James, Henry and Amy. Each member of the household was classified as mulatto (or of mixed ancestry), and all but Lavinia Smith were born in New York. They lived in a mixed neighborhood in the Fifth Ward; in the census, nearly all other neighbors on the page were classified as white; many were immigrants from England, Ireland, and France.|$|E
5|$|Hinde {{attended}} {{elementary and}} middle school in Mount Carmel, Illinois, a town his father founded in 1815. The Hinde family were large landowners in Mount Carmel and Wabash County, Illinois. A portion of the family land was located on the Wabash River and included Hanging Rock and the Grand Rapids Dam. Hinde attended Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw University) in Greencastle {{for a year and a}} half before dropping out following the deaths of his father and mother. Hinde, his brother Edmund C. Hinde, and his sister Belinda Hinde were forced to live with other <b>relatives</b> <b>or</b> fend for themselves. For a short time in the 1850s, Hinde and his younger sister Belinda lived with their older sister, Martha, and her husband, Judge Charles H. Constable, in Mount Carmel and in Marshall, Illinois. As a college dropout, Hinde was initially only able to find work as a grocery clerk in Vincennes and later as a clerk in Mount Carmel. Even though these were low-paying jobs, Hinde was able to support himself because he had inherited large land holdings from his father.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{the aerial}} imagery that the U.S. report said {{suggested}} a lower death toll, the South Korean investigators, drawing on accounts from survivors and area residents, {{said that at}} least 62 bodies had been taken away by <b>relatives,</b> <b>or</b> buried in soldiers' abandoned foxholes, {{in the first days}} after the killings, and others remained inside one underpass tunnel, under thin layers of dirt, out of sight of airborne cameras, and awaiting later burial in mass graves. In addition, South Korean military specialists questioned the U.S. reconnaissance photos, pointing out irregularities, including the fact that the No Gun Ri frames had been spliced into the roll of film, raising the possibility that they were not, as claimed, from August 6, 1950, eight days after the killings.|$|E

5|$|Sicily {{was ruled}} as an {{independent}} kingdom by <b>relatives</b> <b>or</b> cadet branch {{of the house of}} Aragon until 1409 and thence as part of the Crown of Aragon. The Kingdom of Naples was ruled by the Angevin ruler René of Anjou until the two thrones were reunited by AlfonsoV of Aragon, after the successful siege of Naples and the defeat of René on June 6, 1443. Eventually, Alfonso of Aragon divided the two kingdoms during his rule. He gave the rule of Naples to his illegitimate son FerdinandI of Naples, who ruled from 1458 to 1494, {{and the rest of the}} Crown of Aragon and Sicily to Alfonso's brother JohnII of Aragon. From 1494 to 1503 successive kings of France CharlesVIII and LouisXII, who were heirs of Angevins, tried to conquer Naples (see Italian Wars) but failed. Eventually the Kingdom of Naples was reunited with the Crown of Aragon. The titles were held by the Aragonese kings of the Crown of Aragon until the end of the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg in 1700.|$|E
5|$|The Diocese of Miami {{was created}} on October 7, 1958, with Coleman Carroll {{installed}} as bishop. The diocese included the 16 southern counties in Florida, with a Catholic population of 200,000. It encompassed {{one half of}} the area of the state. Less than a year after the creation of the diocese, Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba. This set off a mass exodus of Cuban exiles to South Florida, increasing church membership in the region. The Catholic Welfare Bureau, created by Carroll, played a significant part in helping these waves of Cuban immigrants. Between 1960 and 1962, 14,000 Cuban children were sent to the United States. Operation Pedro Pan, created by Monsignor Bryan O. Walsh, placed them with friends, <b>relatives</b> <b>or</b> the Catholic Welfare Bureau. In 1996, the Catholic Welfare Bureau changed its name to Catholic Charities. Today it claims to be the largest non-governmental provider of social services in South Florida. It served over 17,000 families in the tri-county area of Broward, Dade and Monroe counties in 2006.|$|E
5|$|About {{two weeks}} after the typhoon's passage, there were still 500people in 18shelters in Colonia, the capital city, as well as about 400people in shelters elsewhere. Many others were either {{residing}} with <b>relatives</b> <b>or</b> staying at their damaged properties. The United States Army Corps of Engineers arrived on Yap to coordinate debris removal and installing generators. Officials sent 23flights of aid to the island, as well as one each to the outlying islands of Ulithi and Fais. About 76,000litres (20,000gallons) of water were sent to the island, and five large water tanks were installed. Members of the United States Forest Service arrived to coordinate the receiving and distribution of relief supplies. The Yap hospital was poorly suited to handle the typhoon, {{due to the lack of}} medications or emergency medical equipment. About 60FEMA personnel worked at the hospital, who required additional items, such as their own supply of water and food, to prevent them from acquiring local diseases. During their stay on the island, the group assisted 163people, mostly for minor issues. Overall, there were about 100FEMA workers involved on the island, although only 20 stayed there due to lack of hotels and rental cars.|$|E

5|$|In {{the greater}} St. Petersburg, Pinellas County, area alone, 320,000 people {{evacuated}} {{ahead of the}} storm in what was a national record for the largest evacuation of a single county in history. The large number of refugees from the storm put a strain on facilities, highways, and contingencies. Although {{the number of people}} required to leave far exceeded the capacity of Pinellas County shelters, only 120,000 of the 300,000 or more refugees made use of the shelters. Still, official shelter usage was considered to be higher than average, possibly due to shortened lead times limiting the ability of individuals to make arrangements with friends and <b>relatives,</b> <b>or</b> increased awareness of available resources. Post-storm phone surveys indicated that evacuation order compliance rates were as high as 90% in Pinellas County, and the entire evacuation there took just 9 hours, rather than the expected 15. With over 200,000 individuals recorded to be in more than 120 shelters along the coast of west-central Florida, evacuees became restless {{as a result of the}} duration of the storm. Supplies such as food ran short, and many people ignored orders and tried to return home prematurely. The threat of Hurricane Elena also triggered an unprecedented mass transfer of medical and nursing home patients. Tampa General Hospital, at 84% of patient capacity, was evacuated; four more hospitals and around 19 nursing homes in Pinellas County were also cleared. Overall, nearly 2,000 nursing home patients were transported to safety. Although successful, the process encountered issues such as time constraints and staffing shortages.|$|E
