50|$|The {{vehicle was}} a {{compromise}} between {{the car and the}} motorcycle, with a wooden <b>luggage</b> <b>box</b> 1000 × 800 × 900 mm. But there should also have been three-wheelers for personal transport.|$|R
50|$|Passenger guards also accept heavy parcels and <b>luggage</b> <b>boxes</b> that {{passengers}} cannot {{carry in}} coaches. Some perishable goods like vegetables and milk are also transported under the guard's supervision, {{and he is}} responsible for their proper loading and unloading.|$|R

50|$|Most models did {{not have}} many accessories, unlike the {{competitors}} Minialuxe, but a few items like roof skis did occasionally appear, like on the Panhard Dyna (Ralston 2008, p. 32). After about 1960, opening features began to appear on some - like the opening doors on the Renault 4 van or the Land Rover Expedition, which also featured a spare tire and <b>roof</b> <b>luggage</b> / equipment rack. Also, different companies would often be advertised {{on the sides of}} the model trucks and vans, like Locatel telephone, Cibie lights, or Fleury Michon, a provider of meat products (Ralston 2008, p. 33).|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} a ticket office which sells tickets for both {{domestic}} and international travel, a shop which sells both food, drinks, newspapers and more. The railway station also includes a pay phone, a waiting room, <b>luggage</b> <b>boxes,</b> a photo booth, toilets and an accessible toilet. There is also an opportunity for both bicycle and car parking near the main entrance to the railway station. It is also possible to rent a car at the station or take a taxi. Aalborg Bus Terminal is also only {{across the street from}} the railway station.|$|R
5000|$|In 1981, for {{mainland}} European market only, the Transit Clubmobil {{was introduced}} by the Hymer company. This was fitted with a 1.6 / 2.0 OHC engine, and featured a custom interior - captain style swivel seats in velour, pile carpet, motorsport steering wheel, unique Ronal 14" [...] alloy wheels, unique side windows, folding back seat, <b>luggage</b> <b>box,</b> unique front spoiler, tinted glass, power assisted steering, spare wheel carrier and rear door ladder. In 3 years of production 150 were produced and less than 20 are thought to still exist.|$|R
50|$|The {{industrial}} base is diversified, with {{products such as}} shoes, large truck trailers, technical components for communications, picture frames, golf bags and <b>luggage,</b> tool <b>boxes,</b> wood products and more.|$|R
50|$|Auckland Transport Board, Auckland, New Zealand was the {{greatest}} foreign adherent of the Freeline. They took 160 of the D650HS model between 1952-8, all being thirty-three feet long, with front and centre doors and typically Kiwi doorless <b>luggage</b> <b>boxes</b> below the saloon floor in the wheelbase outboard of the frames. The first (their number 201, registered p2.252) was exported completely built up with a Saunders-Roe B44D body. Daimler and SARO supplied the other 89 of the initial batch as completely knocked down (CKD) kits, which were assembled in New Zealand. The second batch of 70, from 1956-8, were locally bodied.|$|R
50|$|The second bespoke Rolls-Royce Ghost (with Baynunah Brown body colour, Arizona Sun at bonnet, window surrounds, <b>roof</b> and <b>luggage</b> compartment; {{gold-plated}} Spirit of Ecstasy, double coach-line in gold) {{was commissioned}} for delivery to a client {{based in the}} Middle East.|$|R
50|$|Priced {{considerably}} {{higher than the}} Escort, the EXP carried an ample list of standard equipment. It included power brakes, full instrumentation, full carpeting, map lighting, electric back window defroster, power hatchback release, a digital clock, a cargo area security shade , and rims that are noticeably wider than those of Escorts'. Models with a manual transmission had a sport-tuned exhaust. Automatic models had a wide-open throttle cutout switch for the optional air conditioning compressor clutch. Other options include floor vents or air conditioning , AM/FM radio , cruise control , <b>roof</b> <b>luggage</b> rack , rear window wiper , various seat styles and fabrics , removable sunroof , right hand mirror , TRX tires and shocks , child seat , and a very wide variety of colors inside and out with many various pinstripes and other painted decals.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the trip}} was in a jaunting car, an Irish open-air two-wheeled cart drawn by a single horse—which because of the poor roads in {{practice}} meant going {{most of the way}} on foot. Compared to the more fashionable chaise which other travelers took to Scotland, the jaunting car was a plain and exposed vehicle, which the Wordsworths preferred as they could be travelers instead of tourists and remain approachable to the people of Scotland. There was a central <b>luggage</b> <b>box</b> and two seats facing back to back in which the riders' feet were a foot off the ground. As an Irish design, it was an unusual sight and brought a lot of attention along the way, in part because of rumors circulating at the time that Ireland might soon invade Scotland.|$|R
50|$|Gabriel B. Voisin was an {{aviation}} pioneer and manufacturer who in 1919 started producing cars using Knight-type sleeve valve engines at Issy-les-Moulineaux, an industrial suburb {{to the southwest}} of Paris.Former student of the Fine Arts School of Lyon and enthusiast for all things mechanical since his childhood, Voisin's uncompromisingly individual designs made extensive use of light alloys, especially aluminum. One of the company's most striking early designs was the Laboratoire Grand Prix car of 1923; {{one of the first}} cars ever to use monocoque chassis construction, and utilising small radiator-mounted propeller to drive the cooling pump. The characteristic Voisin style of 'rational' coachwork he developed in conjunction with his collaborator André Noel. Noel prioritized lightness, central weight distribution, capacious <b>luggage</b> <b>boxes</b> and distinctively angular lines. The 1930s models with underslung chassis were strikingly low.|$|R
5000|$|The 301C saloon {{produced}} in 1932 and 1933 featured a six-light (three windows {{on each side}} with a rear quarter window) four-door boxy body, with space at the back for a separate boot. Slightly longer-boded versions without the separate <b>luggage</b> <b>box</b> were also available. The 301 CR introduced to the Sochaux lines {{after the summer break}} of 1933 was less angular, and the word [...] "aérodynamique" [...] featured prominently in Peugeot's publicity for the restyled car. [...] Another, bolder change to the look of the saloon came with the introduction of the 301D in 1934. The 301D was no longer a six-light saloon, and it featured a longer sloping tail which suggested the streamlining of the Peugeot 402 and 302 which would appear during the following two years.|$|R

50|$|All trim {{levels are}} {{fitted with a}} {{retractable}} <b>roof</b> installed <b>luggage</b> rack, where the crossmembers are permanently attached but can be swung into the luggage carrier support structure when not in use, currently available only on North American models. Also, the North American Outback has lower side body claddings, which are not applied to international models (although the cladding may come on international models as a dealer-installed option). The interior retractable rear cargo cover has a separate storage compartment in the spare tire storage area so that the cargo cover can be removed for large items but stored inside the vehicle {{and out of the}} way. The rear seatbacks can be partially reclined for comfort.|$|R
50|$|This ski {{came from}} the factory as a {{stripped}} down no-frills machine, {{it does not have}} a tachometer, speedometer, GPS, rear view mirrors, cup holder, ice <b>box,</b> <b>luggage</b> compartment or a reverse mechanism that are typical of larger multi-person skis. Yamaha also manufactured a WaveBlaster 2 and a WaveBlaster 3, the latter more commonly known as the WB800 in reference to its 800cc motor.|$|R
60|$|We took up at a rural bar-room, {{after we}} had gone a few miles, an {{intoxicated}} gentleman who climbed upon the <b>roof</b> among the <b>luggage,</b> and subsequently slipping off without hurting himself, {{was seen in the}} distant perspective reeling back to the grog-shop where we had found him. We also parted with more of our freight at different times, so that when we came to change horses, I was again alone outside.|$|R
5000|$|Mebetoys {{models were}} known for {{well-done}} castings (Rixon 2005, p. 80). Some were very clever model selections {{such as the}} Autobianchi A66 Elaf petroleum with a <b>roof</b> <b>luggage</b> rack carrying two large plastic oil barrels, or the Porsche 912 Rally (a 911 in rally form) with rock guards in thin yellow plastic strips covering the front windshield and hood and also featuring red and chrome body and bumper supports which extended from front to rear bumper. This car, in 1:43 scale, was topped off, literally, with three spare tires on the roof. Mebetoys Innocenti Mini (Italian-made mini) appeared in several different guises - including with skis and sled on its roof rack. Other models were unique {{because they were not}} offered elsewhere, like the ISO Fidia S4 grand touring sedan. Politoys had the Rivolta and Corgi and Matchbox made the Grifo ubiquitous, but nobody else made the Fidia S4. Models such as the Lamborghini Urraco, Maserati Bora, Toyota 2000 GT, and Ferrari 365 GTC-4 were also special and not often seen in 1:43 scale. Corgi Toys made the Bora, but the Mebetoys version was much better proportioned, detailed and painted (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p. 74). Sinclair's Auto Miniatures, largely responsible for bringing the diecast collector hobby to the United States, discussed that many people were not aware that Mebetoys also made a few promotional issue diecast cars (Sinclair's 1977; Levine 2009). In the 1960s the company issued a couple of 1:24 scale Alfa Romeos, referred to as the [...] "le veterane" [...] set. These two cars were a 1925 P2 World Champion Grand Prix car and a 1951 Alfetta racer. They had exquisite detail with rubber tires and were mounted on a wood base with a decorative identification plate and covered with a clear plastic display box. These were reissued in the late 1970s (Sinclair's 1977).|$|R
6000|$|Belonging to the {{generation}} which has {{lived to see}} the Age of Hurry, and has no sympathy with it, Mrs. Presty entered the sitting-room at the hotel, {{two hours before the}} time that had been fixed for leaving Sandyseal, with her mind at ease on the subject of her <b>luggage.</b> [...] "My <b>boxes</b> are locked, strapped and labeled; I hate being hurried. What's that you're reading?" [...] she asked, discovering a book on her daughter's lap, and a hasty action on her daughter's part, which looked like trying to hide it.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the Hualpai Trail (or Havasu Trail?) at Cataract Canyon, {{one of the}} Grand Canyon's canyons, Arizona, ca. 1900 - 1940. The {{canyon walls}} have visible {{horizontal}} layers. The floor is strewn with large rocks. A woman, holding a hat, stands a high elevation looking downward. Close by, a child (male) {{is sitting on a}} mule. Following the child is another mule carrying a load of <b>boxes</b> (<b>luggage?).</b> A man stands at the bottom holding a stick and looking upward. Two men stand at a distance examining the canyon walls...|$|R
25|$|The {{convertible}} roof is fully automatic — an unusual feature {{in such a}} small car — and can be opened partially {{to act as a}} sunroof whilst the car is driving at speed. The convertible model forsakes the rear hatchback of the Hardtop Mini, replacing it with a drop down 'tailgate' that is reminiscent of the classic Mini — it incorporates similarly prominent external hinges, and with the roof in the closed position, the rear <b>roof</b> section and <b>luggage</b> shelf can be raised with two handles, semi-tailgate style, to access the luggage space easier. The convertible also adds two small power windows for the rear seat passengers which are lowered automatically when the roof opens. The roof is made from a heavy cloth, with many layers of insulation; the rear window is glass with an integral heater/defroster, but no washer or wiper.|$|R
5000|$|Most of the Chariot's {{body panels}} were clear - {{including}} {{the roof and}} its dome-shaped [...] "gun hatch". Both a <b>roof</b> rack for <b>luggage</b> and <b>roof</b> mounted [...] "solar batteries" [...] were accessible by exterior fixed ladders {{on either side of}} the vehicle. It had dual headlights and dual auxiliary area lights beneath the front and rear bumpers. The roof also had swivel-mounted, interior controllable spotlights located near each front corner, with a small parabolic antenna mounted between them. The Chariot had six bucket seats (three rows of two seats) for passengers. The interior featured retractable metallised fabric curtains for privacy, a seismograph, a scanner with infrared capability, a radio transceiver, a public address system, and a rifle rack that held four laser rifles vertically near the inside of the left rear corner body panel ("Island in the Sky").|$|R
60|$|Abraham Brown, of Hoxton, London--an old white-headed man, {{without the}} ruddiness which makes white hairs so pleasing--was sworn, and deposed {{that he kept}} a lodging-house at an address he named. On a Saturday evening {{less than a month}} before the fire, a lady came to him, with very little luggage, and took the front room on the second floor. He did not inquire where she came from, as she paid a week in advance, but she gave her name as Mrs. Manston, {{referring}} him, if he wished for any guarantee of her respectability, to Mr. Manston, Knapwater Park. Here she lived for three weeks, rarely going out. She slept away from her lodgings one night during the time. At the end of that time, on the twenty-eighth of November, she left his house in a four-wheeled cab, about twelve o'clock in the day, telling the driver {{to take her to the}} Waterloo Station. She paid all her lodging expenses, and not having given notice the full week previous to her going away, offered to pay for the next, but he only took half. She wore a thick black veil, and grey waterproof cloak, when she left him, and her <b>luggage</b> was two <b>boxes,</b> one of plain deal, with black japanned clamps, the other sewn up in canvas.|$|R
