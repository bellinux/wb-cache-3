50|$|Inflammation of the {{gastrointestinal}} tract is common after treatment with radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis. It {{is classified as}} early if it manifests within the first 3 months, and delayed if it manifests 3 months after treatment. Early <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis</b> is caused by cell death of the crypt epithelium and subsequent mucosal inflammation, however usually subsides after the course of radiation therapy is completed. Delayed <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis</b> is a chronic disease which has a complex pathogenesis involving changes {{in the majority of}} the intestinal wall.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{nutritional}} {{condition of}} 100 patients with <b>radiation</b> chronic <b>enteritis</b> was studied and {{compared with that}} of a consecutive series of 80 patients hospitalized for digestive disorders. The parameters which were measured (body weight, muscular measurement, triceps skinfold creatinine/height index, albumin, transferrin, cholesterol, lymphocytosis), were all significantly lower in patients with radiotherapy enteritis. Anthropometric parameters and lymphocytes were the most affected. The severity of the denutrition was unrelated to the duration of the radiotherapy, the presence of an associated post-radiotherapy involvement of the colon or the urinary tract, a neoplastic recurrence, possible past-history of small bowel surgery; on the contrary, it was related to the extension of actinic lesions on the small bowel and to the presence of subocclusive manifestations. The subsequent evolution at 6 months was most often complicated or unfavorable in patients presenting a severe denutrition. Therefore, denutrition is frequent and severe in the course of post-radiotherapy chronic enteritis and is associated with a more guarded prognosis...|$|R
50|$|Enteritis is the {{inflammation}} of the small intestine. It is generally caused by eating or drinking substances that are contaminated with bacteria or viruses. The bacterium and/or toxin settles in the small intestine and cause inflammation and swelling. This in turn can cause abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, fever, and dehydration. There are other types of enteritis, the types include: bacterial gastroenteritis, Campylobacter enteritis, E. coli enteritis, <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis,</b> Salmonella enteritis and Shigella enteritis.|$|E
50|$|Alternative {{causes of}} this tissue damage have been {{proposed}} and involve release of interleukin 15 and activation of the innate immune system by a shorter gluten peptide (p31-43/49). This would trigger killing of enterocytes by lymphocytes in the epithelium. The villous atrophy seen on biopsy may also be due to unrelated causes, such as tropical sprue, giardiasis and <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis.</b> While positive serology and typical biopsy are highly suggestive of coeliac disease, lack of response to diet may require these alternative diagnoses to be considered.|$|E
50|$|The SeHCAT test {{is used to}} {{investigate}} patients with suspected bile acid malabsorption, who usually experience chronic diarrhea, often passing watery feces 5 to 10 times each day. When ileum has been removed following surgery, or is inflamed in Crohn's disease, the 7-day SeHCAT retention usually is abnormal, {{and most of these}} patients will benefit from treatment with bile acid sequestrants. The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is reduced in these patients with ileal abnormalities and, as the normal bile acid retention exceeds 95%, only a small degree of change is needed. Bile acid malabsorption can also be secondary to cholecystectomy, vagotomy and other disorders affecting intestinal motility or digestion such as <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis,</b> celiac disease and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.|$|E

We present our experi-ence with three cases of <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis</b> that were diagnosed using VCE and DBE, including their effective aspects. <b>Radiation</b> <b>enteritis</b> has not been diagnosed using conventional methods, and DBE may not accomplish deeper insertion into the ileum, although it is capable of both diagnosis and hemostasis.

40|$|In this study, the {{intestinal}} endocrine cells were investigated in 13 surgical specimens affected by <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis.</b> Endocrine cells were studied {{by means of}} Grimelius' silver staining and immunostaining for chromogranin, a general marker of endocrine cells. Positively stained cells were quantified by counting their number per unit length of muscularis mucosa. Results in <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis</b> were compared with matched control specimens by using Student's t test. Chromogranin immunostaining showed a statistically significant increase of endocrine cells in <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis</b> specimens compared with controls both in small and large intestine (ileum, 67. 5 +/- 23. 5 cells per unit length of muscularis mucosa in <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis</b> versus 17. 0 +/- 6. 1 in controls; colon, 40. 9 +/- 13. 7 cells per unit length of muscularis mucosa in <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis</b> versus 9. 5 +/- 4. 1 in controls [...] p less than 0. 005 in both instances).

It {{is not clear whether}} or not the increase of endocrine cells in <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis</b> reported in this study is caused by a hyperplastic response or by a sparing phenomenon. We should consider that increased endocrine cells, when abnormally secreting their products, may be involved in some of the clinical features of radiation enteropathy. In addition, as intestinal endocrine cells produce trophic substances to the intestine, their increase could be responsible for the raised risk of developing carcinoma of the intestine in long standing radiation enteriti...|$|E

Tissue damage was graded histologically. Studies were performed 3 to 29 days after irradiation. Tissue from 7 control animals was also studied. All treated animals developed diarrhoea. Histology showed changes consistent with mild to moderate <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis.</b> Following irradiation, there was an initial increase in frequency followed by a non-significant reduction in the frequency, but not the amplitude of ileal pressure waves. The frequency of pressure waves showed an inverse relationship with time after radiation (r = - 0. 634, p < 0. 002). There was no relationship between motility and histology. We conclude that abdominal irradiation {{is associated with a}} time-dependent reduction in ileal motility which does not correlate with light microscopic changes.

40|$|Copyright © 2007 by the American Physiological SocietyAdministration of {{abdominal}} radiotherapy {{results in}} small intestinal motor dysfunction. We {{have developed a}} rat <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis</b> model that, after exposure in vivo, shows high-amplitude, long-duration (HALD) pressure waves in ex vivo ileal segments. These resemble in vivo dysmotility where giant contractions migrate both antegradely and retrogradely. Mediation of these motor patterns is unclear, although enteric neural components are implicated. After the induction of acute <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis</b> in vivo, ileal segments were isolated and arterially perfused. TTX, hexamethonium, atropine, or the selective muscarinic antagonists pirenzepine (M(1)), methoctramine (M(2)), and 1, 1 -dimethyl- 4 -diphenylacetoxypiperidinium iodide (4 -DAMP; M(3)) {{were added to the}} perfusate. The baseline mean rate per minute per channel of HALD pressure waves was 0. 35 +/- 0. 047. This was significantly reduced by TTX (83. 3 %, P < 0. 01), hexamethonium (90. 3 %, P < 0. 03), and atropine (98. 4 %, P < 0. 01). The HALD pressure wave mean rate per minute per channel was significantly reduced by pirenzepine (81. 1 %, P < 0. 03), methoctramine (96. 8 %, P < 0. 001), and 4 -DAMP (93. 1 %, P < 0. 03) compared with predrug baseline data. As an indicator of normal motility patterns, the frequency of low-amplitude, short-duration pressure waves was also assessed. The mean rate per minute per channel of 5. 15 +/- 0. 98 was significantly increased by TTX (19 %, P < 0. 05) but significantly reduced by pirenzepine (35. 1 %, P < 0. 02) and methoctramine (75 %, P < 0. 0003). However, the rate of small-amplitude pressure waves was not affected by hexamethonium, atropine, or the M(3) antagonist 4 -DAMP.

Gastrointestinal symptoms; absorption of bile acid, vitamin B 12, lactose, and fat; gastric emptying; small intestinal and whole gut transit; and intestinal permeability were measured during placebo and loperamide-N-oxide phases. Data were compared with those obtained in 18 normal subjects. In the patients, {{in addition to an}} increased frequency of bowel actions (p < 0. 001), there was reduced bile acid absorption, (p < 0. 001) a higher prevalence of lactose malabsorption (p < 0. 05) associated with a reduced dietary intake of dairy products (p < 0. 02), and faster small intestinal (p < 0. 001) and whole gut transit (p < 0. 05) when compared with the normal subjects. There {{was no significant difference in}} gastric emptying between the two groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND: During {{radiotherapy}} {{in most of}} the irradiated patients occur {{the symptoms}} of acute <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis,</b> less frequently cystitis or proctitis. The aim of this work was to apply non invasive exclusion methods to reduce the small bowel volume within the pelvic high dose volume and indirectly to reduce the number and severity of acute <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis</b> METHODS: A total number of 183 patients were enrolled in our prospective randomised investigation we performed at the Clinic of Oncology in Knez Selo during one year. Ninety patients from E-group were irradiated with the standard technique two opposite parallel fields on the Mevatron- 7445 linear accelerator (SIEMENS) patient-table, while 93 from C-group were irradiated under special conditions on our unique patient-table (PT) manufactured at our special demands by the Jugorendgen Ei-Ni¹ factory Brachytherapy was administered with RALT technique in both groups with isotope machine BUCHLER. RESULTS: Individual application of exclusion techniques led to protection of over 50 % of the small bowel (118 - 1065 cm 3) in 30 / 43 (70 %) patients, and even in 10 / 43 (23 %) more than 90 % of the small bowel was protected (118 - 835 cm 3), which would otherwise be irradiated with conventional techniques. None of the patients from E-group (out of 90) had more than 8 stools a day (G 3), while in C-group there were 20 such cases Seventy-seven percent of the patients from E-group had formed stool, while the percent in C-group was 29.

40|$|Purpose. <b>Radiation</b> <b>enteritis</b> is {{the main}} acute side-effect during pelvic irradiation. The {{aim of this study}} was to {{quantify}} the dose-volume relationship between irradiated bowel volumes and acute enteritis during combined chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer. Material and methods. Twenty-eight patients with locally advanced rectal cancer received chemoradiotherapy. The radiation therapy was given with a traditional multi-field technique to a total dose of 50 Gy, with concurrent 5 -Fluorouracil (5 -FU) and oxaliplatin (OXA) based chemotherapy. All patients underwent three-dimensional CT-based treatment planning. Individual loops of small and large bowel as well as a volume defined as "whole abdomen'' were systematically contoured on each CT slice, and dose-volume histograms were generated. Diarrhea during treatment was scored retrospectively according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria scale. Results. There was a strong correlation between the occurrence of grade 2 + diarrhea and irradiated small bowel volume, most notably at doses > 15 Gy. Neither irradiated large bowel volume, nor irradiated "whole abdomen'' volume correlated significantly with diarrhea. Clinical or treatment related factors such as age, gender, hypertension, previous surgery, enterostomy, or dose fractionation (1. 8 vs. 2. 0 Gy/fraction) did not correlate with grade 2 + diarrhea. Discussion. This study indicates a strong dose-volume relationship between small bowel volume and <b>radiation</b> <b>enteritis</b> during 5 -FU-OXA-based chemoradiotherapy.
