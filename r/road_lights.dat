40|$|It is {{observed}} that the power consumption of <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> is increased with the length of trafficable road in Hong Kong. The energy used in <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> is increasing, {{which means that the}} greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted from power plant for generating electricity for <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> {{is at the same time}} increasing. To compare the performance of light emitted diode (LED) <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> with <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> of other lamp sources, literature review, life cycle assessment (LCA) and technical assessment are adopted to give an overall comparison. This research focuses more on the environmental impacts of <b>road</b> <b>lighting.</b> LCA is adopted in order to give a comprehensive view on the environmental impact of <b>road</b> <b>lighting.</b> A total of 3 different lamp sources are compared: high pressure sodium (HPS) lamp, induction lamp and light emitted diode (LED) lamp. From the model result, it is found that due to the low power consumption and long life time, LED and induction lamp <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> gives generally less environmental impact than HPS <b>road</b> <b>lighting.</b> As induction lamp has a longer life span than LED, the environmental impact of induction lamp <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> is found slightly less than that of LED <b>road</b> <b>lighting.</b> Taking account the future development in LED technology, leading to longer life time, higher efficacy and lower production cost, LED <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> is expected to be a replacement for <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> in Hong Kong for the future. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R

30|$|However, {{vehicle speed}} {{decreased}} due to bad weather conditions (rain and snow) and the decrease was substantially higher on <b>roads</b> without <b>lighting</b> than on <b>roads</b> with <b>lighting.</b> Our results therefore suggests that when <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> is present, drivers respond less strongly to worsened weather conditions, especially during darkness. This indicates that <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> may indeed induce higher vehicle speed, but mainly in special circumstances such as “bad” weather conditions. The presence of <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> may therefore influence driving behavior so that drivers do not adapt adequately or {{as well to}} the prevailing weather conditions as they might if <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> were not present. Although the correlation reported between the presence of <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> and fewer accidents (e.g., Jackett and Frith 2013) {{would suggest that the}} higher visibility in general may compensate for the higher vehicle speed also in worsened weather conditions. However, weather conditions, especially rain, has been shown to significantly affect the number of fatalities, serious injuries and light injuries. The higher the accident severity, the more important was the impact of lighting conditions (Yannis et al. 2013).|$|R

Smart street lights are vitality effective as well as extremely dependable. The primary thought in the present field advances are computerizations, power utilization, and expense adequacy. Automation is implied for the decrease of labor as the human has gotten to be excessively occupied and even incapable, making it impossible to discover time to switch the lights. Presently a day’s everybody are mindful of the availability of limited power sources like coal, biomass, and hydro and so on. Unnecessary wastage of power in the street lights is one of the noticeable power loss. Two sensors viz.

40|$|In 2004, the Swedish Road Administration and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities {{published}} a handbook, VGU, {{on the design}} of roads and streets, in which one of the sections deals with <b>road</b> <b>lighting.</b> The main thought in the VGU is to reallocate means for <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> from <b>roads</b> where the benefit for traffic safety is low, to roads where it is high. Consequently, good <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> is primarily recommended on roads and streets where unprotected road-users, such as cyclists and pedestrians, pass. The aim of this project was to analyse the effect of reduced or turned off <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> on motorways, considering road-user behaviour and attitudes. The intention was to use two existing motorway stretches for the trial, both with a large part of commuter traffic. On one road stretch, the existing <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> should be reduced by half, while it should be completely turned off at the other. Interviews with commuters should be carried out after the lighting reduction, and speed measurements should be made before and after the reduction. Because of the strong negative reaction from one person living close to the road stretch where the <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> was completely turned off and that this person contacted media, it was necessary to turn on the <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> again. As a result of this, no attitude study could be accomplished, and no measurements of speed after the reduction on this road stretch were possible. Accordingly, it was only possible to make speed measurements on the motorway stretch where the <b>road</b> <b>lighting</b> had been reduced by 50 per cent...|$|R

The test sequences are manually annotated to identify the position of the car lights in the video frames. The method is robust against poor and variable light condition of the scenes.

40|$|Light {{pollution}} is increasing {{around the world}} and altering natural nightscapes with potential ecological and evolutionary consequences. A severe ecological perturbation caused by artificial lights is mass mortalities of organisms, including seabird fledglings that are attracted to lights at night on their first flights to the sea. Here, we report on the number of fledging short-tailed shearwaters Ardenna tenuirostris found grounded in evening and morning rescue patrols conducted at Phillip Island, Australia, during a 15 -year period (1999 – 2013). We assessed factors affecting numbers of grounded birds and mortality including date, moon phase, wind direction and speed, number of visitors and holiday periods. We also tested experimentally if birds were attracted to lights by turning the lights off on a section of the road. Of 8871 fledglings found, 39 % were dead or dying. This mortality rate was 4 – 8 times higher than reported elsewhere for other shearwater species, probably because searching for fledglings was part of our systematic rescue effort rather than the opportunistic rescue used elsewhere. Thus, it suggests that light-induced mortality of seabirds is usually underestimated. We rescued more birds (dead and alive) in peak fledging, moonless and windy nights. Mortality increased through the fledging period, in the mornings and with increased traffic on holiday periods. Turning the <b>road</b> <b>lights</b> off decreased the number of grounded birds (dead and alive).

This paper contributes to a method of fusing the data output of VLMS with existing geographic data sources, where focus is cast on the rectification of GPS/INS parameters, which might be quite erroneous in urban area. An algorithm is developed to correct four parameters of each GPS/INS update, i. e. xyz coordinates of vehicle position and yaw angle of vehicle orientation, by registering the laser points of VLMS with an existing data source, e. g.

Manually assigning 18 sets of tie-points, GPS/INS parameters are corrected automatically and efficiently, so that the laser points of VLMS are matched to a DSM.

40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} of improved road light design for drivers and pedestrians {{with the use}} of a ray- or reverse ray-tracing method. Many existing <b>road</b> <b>lights</b> are unsuitable for drivers and pedestrians because of serious problems such as glare effect or randomicity of illuminated areas. This situation has arisen because in customary design methods the emphasis has been on simple factors such as luminance or electrical power. However a high luminance or electrical power consumption, alone, do not guarantee bright and good road lighting. So we have applied a ray-tracing method to the design of a road light reflector with the goals of ensuring that illuminated objects on the road can be seen more clearly and that the illuminating light is more comfortable for the eyes of drivers and pedestrians. We have set design targets for factors such as the uniformity of lighting on the road area per road light, the shading angles and the continuous luminance uniformity on long lengths of road. For set heights of the eyes of drivers and pedestrians eyes we have calculated a design guideline for the achievement of the above design targets. Then we designed a road light reflector using the reverse ray-tracing approach. Also we have achieved the same luminance on the road with almost half the power consumption, through the reduction of lighty loss. In an ideal design optimum parameters are suggested to be a shading angle of 75 degrees and a luminance uniformity of 0. 5 on the road area. This reflecto...|$|E
