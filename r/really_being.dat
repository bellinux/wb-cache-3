The last officially {{functioning}} anti-Sergiite church in Moscow was closed in 1933 and in Leningrad in 1936.

25|$|Monty Cranfield was a right-arm leg {{break and}} off break bowler and a {{right-handed}} lower-order batsman who played fairly regularly for Gloucestershire {{both before and}} after the Second World War without ever <b>really</b> <b>being</b> certain of his place in the team. As a spin bowler, he coincided for much of his career with off-spinner Tom Goddard and then later with the slow left-arm spin bowler Sam Cook, both Test players and inevitable first-choice bowlers. As a result, he never achieved 50 wickets in a single English season, and nor did he ever bowl as many as 500 overs in a single season. As a batsman, though he often made useful runs, he had only one season, when he was 37 years old, when he was anywhere close to a front-line batsman.|$|E

500|$|Absence as a lyrical {{theme is}} common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War. Waters' lyrics also {{explored}} unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt {{with the loss of}} youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: [...] "The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling." [...] Waters commented: [...] "it's about none of us <b>really</b> <b>being</b> there... should have been called Wish We Were Here".|$|E

[...] "She was really excited about the whole thing," [...] Jean recalled. [...] "After she signed on to do it, she came in to record dialogue twice, and we showed her a rough cut the second time." [...] Recording sessions for the episode took place in Los Angeles during a period of four days from August 22–26. Gaga was initially apprehensive while recording on set, which led her to review the satirical nature of the show to get a better understanding on how to perform. [...] "Their characters are so awesomely convincing and sincere and wild and funny, I had to remind myself constantly of the sincerity of the humor," [...] she explained. [...] "That's what I was trying to focus on—not putting on a character too much, and <b>really</b> <b>being</b> as sincere as I could with the lines."

[...] The successful performance earned Hendrix his first interview, published in Record Mirror with the headline: [...] "Mr. Phenomenon". [...] "Now hear this... we predict that [...] is going to whirl around the business like a tornado", wrote Bill Harry, who asked the rhetorical question: [...] "Is that full, big, swinging sound <b>really</b> <b>being</b> created by only three people?" [...] Hendrix commented: [...] "We don't want to be classed in any category... If it must have a tag, I'd {{like it to be}} called, 'Free Feeling'. It's a mixture of rock, freak-out, rave and blues". After appearances on the UK television shows Ready Steady Go! and the Top of the Pops, [...] "Hey Joe" [...] entered the UK charts on December 29, 1966, peaking at number six. Further success came in March 1967 with the UK number three hit [...] "Purple Haze", and in May with [...] "The Wind Cries Mary", which remained on the UK charts for eleven weeks, peaking at number six.|$|E
500|$|The album's cover art {{features}} {{the members of}} the band at the time of recording in a group pose and {{standing in front of a}} wood cut-out of the name [...] "Pearl Jam". The wood cut-out was constructed by Ament. Ament said, [...] "The original concept was about <b>really</b> <b>being</b> together as a group and entering into the world of music as a true band...a sort of all-for-one deal." [...] Ament is credited for the album's artwork and art direction, Lance Mercer receives credit for photography, and both Lisa Sparagano and Risa Zaitschek are credited for design. Ament stated, [...] "There was a bit of headbutting going on with the Sony art department at that time. The version that everybody got to know as the Ten album cover was pink and it was originally intended to be more of a burgundy color and the picture of the band was supposed to be black and white." [...] Pearl Jam's original name was taken from the professional basketball player Mookie Blaylock. It was changed after the band signed to Epic Records, as record executives were concerned about intellectual property and naming rights following Blaylock's inking of an endorsement deal with Nike. In commemoration of the band's original name, the band titled its first album Ten after Blaylock's jersey number.|$|E

They thought it was important that Grace meet a [...] "menschy, nice Jewish man who happens to be a hottie, and that's what we got with Harry Connick Jr," [...] she said. According to The Nation magazine, {{this was the first time}} that a prime-time sitcom showed a Jewish protagonist (Grace) marrying inside the faith. Connick, who is part-Jewish, said he enjoyed the fact that he was not asked to sing on the show, because [...] "it throws you out of character a little bit when that stuff happens. It's been great just doing the acting thing." [...] Messing, in discussing Grace and Leo's relationship, commented that it is [...] "unlike anything that Grace has ever been a part of before and just the little that we've done so far, it feels wonderful to be playing with Harry." [...] In another interview, also discussing the characters' relationship, she explained, [...] "...bringing Leo into it and making it a viable and potent relationship for Grace, that's never happened before. I think she's a little less frenetic and neurotic, and I think that <b>really</b> <b>being</b> in love markedly changes Grace.

500|$|Clay, {{the protagonist}} of Less Than Zero, [...] "once a paralyzed observer, is now a more active {{character}} and has grown to be a narcissist". The reason behind this shift in character personality was due to Ellis's {{lack of interest in}} the other characters—thus the solipsism is mirrored in the fiction. For Ellis, this became [...] "an exploration of intense narcissism." [...] In 2010, Clay is now a [...] "successful screenwriter" [...] with the [...] "occasional producer credit". He returns to LA to help cast The Listeners (reminiscent of Ellis' involvement with the 2009 film adaptation of his short story collection The Informers). Now 45, and no longer a disaffected teen, Clay is described by Details as [...] "arguably worse than American Psychos Patrick Bateman"; Ellis says that he would not disagree with this, citing the ambiguous nature of Bateman's crimes. In terms of Clay's psychology, Ellis notes his preponderance for a [...] "masochistic cycle of control and rejection and seduction and inevitable pain", which [...] "is something he gets off on because he's ...a masochist and not a romantic." [...] The Los Angeles Times notes how Clay [...] "shares biographical details with Ellis", a successful party-boy, who in 1985 was [...] "often conflated with his fictional counterpart." [...] Ellis asserts to the contrary, [...] "I'm not really Clay." [...] As opposed to his portrayal in Less Than Zero, Clay is more unambiguously manipulative in Bedrooms; he is, in Ellis' words, [...] "guilty". As in Zero, Clay has stagnated in an impassive and jaded state, abusing alcohol and sedatives such as ambien, [...] "living with a kind of psychic [...] "locked-in" [...] syndrome." [...] As in Zero and Psycho, the novel also poses the question of Clay's perception of reality, The Independent asking [...] "Is Clay <b>really</b> <b>being</b> followed or is he being dogged by a guilty conscience for crimes committed, even when they are crimes of inaction?" [...] Over the novel, [...] "Clay shifts from damaged to depraved"; a [...] "final scene in Imperial Bedrooms of unremitting torture... enacted by Clay on two beautiful teenagers who are bought and systematically abused" [...] demonstrates [...] "Clay's graduation from a passively colluding observer to active perpetrator... who either indulges in torture or fantasizes about it." ...|$|E
