5|$|Pathfinder : This is {{the first}} real {{advancement}} badge. It focuses on basic Scout training, including the six basic knots (<b>Reef</b> <b>Knot,</b> Bowline, Sheet bend, Sheepshank, Figure-of-eight, and Clove hitch), basic first aid (treatment of open wounds and bleeding), and introduces Scouts to camping. The badge encourages a Scout to participate in patrol activities. The Scout is required to have camped away from their normal Scout meeting place {{for at least five}} nights.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>reef</b> <b>knot's</b> familiarity, ease of tying, and {{visually}} appealing symmetry conceal its weakness. The International Guild of Knot Tyers warns that this knot {{should never be}} used to bend two ropes together. A proper bend knot, for instance a sheet bend or double fisherman's knot, should be used instead. Knotting authority Clifford Ashley claimed that misused <b>reef</b> <b>knots</b> have caused more deaths and injuries than all other knots combined. [...] Further, it is easily confused with the granny knot, {{which is a very}} poor knot.|$|R

There were 3350 participants in the jamboree. The Chief Scout Tung Chee-hwa, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, joined the open ceremony on 30 December. To complete the failed knotting competition of the previous jamboree, the Chief Scout began the first <b>reef</b> <b>knots</b> {{and the rest of}} the campers tied 4500 <b>reef</b> <b>knots</b> in 5 minutes, chaining in 6858 metres long.|$|R

25|$|When {{tying the}} half-knots, a right-over-left half-knot {{followed}} by a left-over-right half-knot (or vice versa) forms a square or <b>reef</b> <b>knot,</b> a fairly effective knot {{for the purpose of}} tying shoelaces. However, tying two consecutive right-over-left half-knots (or two consecutive left-over-right half-knots) forms the infamous granny knot, which is much less secure. Most people who use it will find themselves regularly retying their shoelaces.|$|E
25|$|The WOSM emblem and {{membership}} badge is the World Scout Emblem, a purple, circular logo with a fleur-de-lis in the center, {{surrounded by a}} length of rope tied with a <b>reef</b> <b>knot</b> (also called a square knot). Baden-Powell used a fleur-de-lis badge awarded to British Army scouts and subsequently adopted and modified the badge for Scouting. The arrowhead represents the North point on a compass, and is intended to point Scouts {{on the path to}} service and unity. The three points on the fleur-de-lis represent the three parts of the Scout Promise: - service to others, duty to God and obedience to the Scout Law. The two five-point stars stand for truth and knowledge, with the ten points representing the ten points of the Scout Law. The bond {{at the base of the}} fleur-de-lis symbolizes the family of Scouting. The encircling rope symbolizes the unity and family of the World Scout Movement.|$|E

40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND: Interrupted corneal sutures {{are used}} {{routinely}} by many cataract and corneal surgeons. A slim compact knot facilitates burial and allows atraumatic suture removal, with decreased risk of wound dehiscence. The size and morphology of knots tied in different configurations were investigated. METHODS: 10 - 0 nylon suture material {{was used to}} tie knots on porcine corneal cataract sections using 2 / 1 / 1 (reef and granny), 3 / 1 / 1, and 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 (slip knot) configurations. 10 - 0 Mersilene was used to tie 2 / 1 / 1 <b>reef</b> <b>knots.</b> Scanning electron micrographs of the knots were digitised and their maximal lengths and widths estimated. In addition, the area of each knot was calculated and used as an index of its volume. RESULTS: 2 / 1 / 1 <b>reef</b> <b>knots</b> were significantly smaller in all dimensions compared with the other knots (all p < 0. 03) except for the maximal width of 2 / 1 / 1 granny knots which were no wider than the 2 / 1 / 1 granny knots. The Mersilene knots were larger than the nylon ones. CONCLUSION: The use of 2 / 1 / 1 <b>reef</b> <b>knots</b> is recommended for corneal suturing...|$|R
50|$|Half knots {{are tied}} {{alternately}} behind {{and in front}} of the rope until the width of the band of twine approaches the diameter of the rope. A <b>reef</b> (square) <b>knot,</b> or better a series of <b>reef</b> (square) <b>knots,</b> completes the whipping. If a needle is available this string of <b>reef</b> (square) <b>knots</b> can be pulled through the rope to bury the ends. Alternatively, a short bight of another rope can be laid first and used to pull the rope ends through. If the rope is a stranded rope, the ends can usually be pulled through without a needle.|$|R
50|$|The twine {{is first}} {{threaded}} diagonally through the rope. The twine is then wrapped round the rope including the diagonally threaded end. A needle is {{then used to}} thread the two ends through the rope to enclose the wrapping turns. Finally a reef (square) or a string of <b>reef</b> (square) <b>knots</b> is tied. Then this string of <b>reef</b> (square) <b>knots</b> is pulled through the rope to bury the ends.|$|R

40|$|Thoracoscopic surgery has {{usually been}} limited by 2 -dimensional {{vision and the}} limited space between ribs—problems that have been only {{partially}} overcome {{by the use of}} robotics. One of the technical challenges of any minimally invasive surgical approach is tying an intracorporeal knot. For the thoracoscopic surgeon, we describe an easier technique of knot-tying that involves using a right-angled dissector. The technique enables ambidextrous performance and is particularly useful for ligating major pulmonary vessels that might be too small to be stapled or too confined for the admission and maneuvering of a stapling device.

In Indian study predominant suicidal victims are males, literates, married and from rural background. Aim {{of the present study}} is to asses Psychological factors, socio demographic characteristic in relation to family history of suicide associated with complete suicide by hanging. Out of 128 suicidal cases 80 cases which meet the criteria were selected for the present study. Data were collected using semi structured performer for the demographic, psychological, social, tying pattern. Knot analysis for type and handedness were analysed for family history and without the family history of suicide cases. More than 60 % of suicide victims were in the age group of 15 to 34 yrs. Male outnumbered females in this study. Psychosocial stress were found in 71 % of suicide victims. Granny or <b>Reef</b> <b>knots</b> were the most preferred used for suicidal hanging with family history of suicide. Using right hand proved left hemisphere dominance.

2500|$|The fleur-de-lis is {{the main}} element in the logo of most Scouting organizations. The symbol was first used by Sir Robert Baden-Powell as an arm-badge for {{soldiers}} who qualified as scouts (reconnaissance specialists) in the 5th Dragoon Guards, which he commanded {{at the end of}} the 19th century; it was later used in cavalry regiments throughout the British Army until 1921. In 1907, Baden-Powell made brass fleur-de-lis badges for the boys attending his first experimental [...] "Boy Scout" [...] camp at Brownsea Island. In his seminal book Scouting for Boys, Baden-Powell referred to the motif as [...] "the arrowhead which shows the North on a map or a compass" [...] and continued; [...] "It is the Badge of the Scout because it points in the right direction and upward... The three points remind you of the three points of the Scout Promise", being duty to God and country, helping others and keeping the Scout Law.

50|$|There {{are several}} ways to tie a {{shoelace}} knot; each starts with the tying of a half hitch, and requires attention or some habitual mechanism for arriving at a knot that is an elaboration of the <b>reef</b> (or square) <b>knot</b> rather than of the granny (or lubber's) knot. One approach is to start by taking, in each hand, the end of the lace that emerges from the uppermost eyelet on that hand's side of the shoe; then passing the dominant hand's end under the other end, from front toward back, and dropping each lace on the opposite side from where it started; and in the finishing step again grasping the lace on each side with the hand on that side (perhaps taking time to note that because each end crossed over the shoe before, the laces have switched hands—or vice versa, the hands have switched laces) and again passing the dominant hand's end under the other end, from front toward back.|$|R
6000|$|Neb had {{received}} private instructions, and my sea dunnage, {{as well as}} his own, was on board the Wallingford--low enough the wreck had reduced both to be--and money obtained from Mr. Hardinge was used to purchase more. I now began to look about me for a ship, determined to please my eye as to the vessel, and my judgment as to the voyage. Neb had orders to follow the wharves on the same errand. I would sooner trust Neb than Rupert on such a duty. The latter had no taste for ships; felt no interest in them; and I have often wondered why he took a fancy to go to sea at all. With Neb it was very different. He was already an expert seaman; could hand, <b>reef</b> and steer, <b>knot</b> and splice, and was as useful as nine men in ten on board a vessel. It is true, he did not know when it became necessary to take in the last reef--had no notion of stowing a cargo so as to favour the vessel, or help her sailing; but he would break out a cask sooner than most men I ever met with. There was too much [...] "nigger" [...] in him for head-work of that sort, though he was ingenious and ready enough in his way. A sterling fellow was Neb, and I got in time to love him very much as I can conceive one would love a brother.|$|R

Methods: A postal questionnaire was sent to 137 ophthalmic consultants identified from a Royal College of Ophthalmology database as having {{a special interest in}} anterior segment surgery. The questionnaire surveyed surgeon preferences for surgical and suturing technique for penetrating keratoplasty surgery, and the postoperative care of corneal grafts. Results: In all, 68 % of questionnaires were completed and returned: 73 % of respondents used a Flieringa ring or equivalent, 94 % routinely used cardinal sutures, with 50. 5 % removing them {{at the end of the}} procedure. The most common suturing technique for routine penetrating keratoplasty was a single continuous suture (35 %). In these cases, a 10 / 0 nylon suture was used by 89 %. Sixty-six percent changed their technique in high-risk cases, 52 % used a 3 - 1 - 1 knot, and 75 % made a distinction between a <b>reef</b> and granny <b>knot,</b> with 76 % using a reef. Thirty percent buried the knots within the donor material, and 29 % within the host tissue. Twenty-five percent had no routine time for graft suture removal, but 41 % removed them between 1 and 2 years post-surgery. After suture removal, 98 % used steroids and 88 % used topical antibiotics. Thirty-four percent stopped topical steroids before suture removal, with 38 % stopping topical steroids more than 3 months prior to suture removal. Conclusion: This survey demonstrates that there is considerable variation in suturing techniques and postoperative care for penetrating keratoplasty. These significant variations in practice need to be considered when interpreting outcomes and research.
