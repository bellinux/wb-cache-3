40|$|Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) that {{accurately}} replicate both landscape {{form and}} processes {{are critical to}} support modelling of environmental processes. Topographic accuracy, methods of preparation and grid size are all important for hydrodynamic models to efficiently replicate flow processes. In remote and data-scarce regions, high resolution DEMs are often not available and therefore {{it is necessary to}} evaluate lower resolution data such as the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) for use within hydrodynamic models. This paper does this in three ways: (i) assessing point accuracy and geometric co-registration error of the original DEMs; (ii) quantifying the effects of DEM preparation methods (vegetation smoothed and hydrologically-corrected) on hydrodynamic modelling relative accuracy; and (iii) quantifying the effect of the hydrodynamic model grid size (30 – 2000 m) and the associated relative computational costs (run time) on relative accuracy in model outputs. We initially evaluated the accuracy of the original SRTM (∼ 30 m) seamless C-band DEM (SRTM DEM) and second generation products from the ASTER (ASTER GDEM) against <b>registered</b> <b>survey</b> marks and altimetry data points from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). SRTM DEM (RMSE = 3. 25 m,) had higher accuracy than ASTER GDEM (RMSE = 7. 43 m). Based on these results, the original version of SRTM DEM, the ASTER GDEM along with vegetation smoothed and hydrologically corrected versions were prepared and used to simulate three flood events along a 200 km stretch of the low-gradient Thompson River, in arid Australia (using five metrics: peak discharge, peak height, travel time, terminal water storage and flood extent). The hydrologically corrected DEMs performed best across these metrics in simulating floods compared with vegetation smoothed DEMs and original DEMs. The response of model performance to grid size was non-linear and while the smaller grid sizes (⩽ 120 m) improved the hydrodynamic model results, these offered only slight improvements at very significant computational costs compared to grid size of 120 m, with grid sizes 250 m and greater decreasing in model accuracy. This study highlights the important impact that the quality of the underlying DEM has, and in particular how sensitive hydrodynamic models are to preparation methods and how important vegetation smoothing and hydrological correction of the base topographic data for modelling floods in low-gradient and multi-channel environments...|$|E

In contrast, survey and cohort studies contain more detailed data from a sample of the population.

The methods are applied to a study of low birth weight and air pollution in England and Wales using a combination of <b>register,</b> <b>survey,</b> and small-area aggregate data. We discuss issues such as multiple imputation of confounding variables missing in one data set, survey selection bias, and appropriate propagation of information between model components. From the register data, there appears to be an association between low birth weight and environmental exposure to NO 2, but after adjusting for confounding by ethnicity and maternal smoking by combining the <b>register</b> and <b>survey</b> data under our models, we find there is no significant association.

50|$|The use of {{alternative}} enumeration strategies is increasing {{but these are}} not so simple as many people assume and only occur in developed countries. The Netherlands has been most advanced in adopting a census using administrative data. This allows a simulated census to be conducted by linking several different administrative databases at an agreed time. Data can be matched and an overall enumeration established accounting for where the different sources are discrepant. A validation survey is still conducted in a similar way to the post enumeration survey employed in a traditional census.Other countries which have a population register use this as a basis for all the census statistics needed by users. This is most common amongst Nordic countries but requires a large number of different registers to be combined including population, housing, employment and education. These registers are then combined and brought up to the standard of a statistical register by comparing the data in different sources and ensuring the quality is sufficient for official statistics to be produced.A recent innovation is the French instigation of a rolling census programme with different regions enumerated each year such that the whole country is completely enumerated every 5 to 10 years. In Europe, in connection with the 2010 census round, a large number of countries adopted alternative census methodologies, often based on the combination of data from <b>registers,</b> <b>surveys</b> and other sources.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Introduction: the Belgian {{province}} of Luxembourg {{has a high}} incidence of cardiovascular (CV) disease according to the MONICA <b>register.</b> <b>Surveys</b> conducted in adults and children have also found high CV risk factor levels in this province. Design: cross-sectional study. Objective of the present study: to collect data about blood pressure (BP) and its determinants in adolescents from this high CV risk population and to analyse their relationship. Participants: 1526 adolescents (12 - 17 years) in 24 secondary schools of the province. Results: mean systolic BP levels were 125 mmHg (sd= 12 mmHg) and 122 mmHg (sd= 11 mmHg) for boys an girls, respectively. Mean diastolic BP was equal to 74 mmHg (sd = 10 mmHg) in both genders. Systolic BP increased with age and differed significantly between genders from 15 years onwards. Body fatness indices increased with age except waist-to-hip ratio in girls and triceps skinfold in boys. Regression models including age, anthropometric indices and physical activity explained a small percentage of BP variance (for systolic BP, r²= 0. 21 and 0. 12 for boys and girls, respectively). Weight was the first parameter related to BP in correlation with regression analyses. Conclusions: this study showed high BP and body fatness indices in adolescents fom a high CV risk population. The model under study showed a moderate relationship between body fatness and BP. This finding suggests other influences as genetic component to account for the high levels observed.

40|$|In this paper, the {{evolution}} of mortality since 1960 has been reconstructed for Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt. The procedure has been to collect in each country all the existing data (population <b>register,</b> <b>surveys,</b> etc.), to check chronological and spatial cohesion and to estimate reliability, before making a final choice of the best estimates. The mortality transition has started. On the whole, progress has been remarkable during the last 20 years. In 1970 life expectancy was only from 50 to 52 years in the region; today it reaches nearly 70 years in Tunisia, 66 years in Algeria and Morocco, and 64 years in Egypt. Infant mortality has decreased considerably. Differences with regard to child mortality increased between countries. Tunisia maintained first place with the lowest rates. Algerian rates, however, are decreasing and have approached those of Tunisia within the last 10 years. Morocco is still in an intermediate position, and Egypt lags behind. Infant mortality ranges from 55 per 1000 in Tunisia to 80 per 1000 in Egypt. Female overmortality {{was one of the}} important characteristics of the region in the years 1960 and 1970. There is a tendency towards a decrease and a concentration {{in the first years of}} life (between 1 month and 5 years). But it still exists, denoting a certain sexual discrimination.
