40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for the {{simultaneous}} separation and recognition of speech mixtures in noisy environments using two-channel based independent vector analysis (IVA) on a home-robot cleaner. The issues {{to be considered in}} our target application are speech recognition at a distance and noise removal to cope with a variety of noises, including TV sounds, air conditioners, babble, and so on, that can occur in a house, where people can utter a voice command to control a <b>robot</b> <b>cleaner</b> at any time and at any location, even while a <b>robot</b> <b>cleaner</b> is moving. Thus, the system should always be in a recognition-ready state to promptly recognize a spoken word at any time, and the false acceptance rate should be lower. To cope with these issues, the keyword spotting technique is applied. In addition, a microphone alignment method and a model-based real-time IVA approach are proposed to effectively and simultaneously process the speech and noise sources, as well as to cover 360 -degree directions irrespective of distance. From the experimental evaluations, we show that the proposed method is robust in terms of speech recognition accuracy, even when the speaker location is unfixed and changes all the time. In addition, the proposed method shows good performance in severely noisy environments...|$|E

To cope with the {{pressure}} drop problem of the duct flow field in a <b>robot</b> vacuum <b>cleaner,</b> a method based on Pressure Implicit with Splitting of Operators (PRISO) algorithm is introduced and the optimisation design of the duct flow field is implemented. Firstly, the duct structure in a <b>robot</b> vacuum <b>cleaner</b> is taken as a research object, with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) theories adopted; a three&# 8208;dimensional fluid model of the duct is established by means of the FLUENT solver of the CFD software.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an online}} inverse reinforcement learning algorithm aimed at efficiently recovering a reward function from ongoing observations of an agent's actions. To reduce the computation time and storage space in reward estimation, this work assumes that each observed action implies {{a change of}} the Q-value distribution, and relates the change to the reward function via the gradient of Q-value with respect to reward function parameter. The gradients are computed with a novel Bellman Gradient Iteration method that allows the reward function to be updated whenever a new observation is available. The method's convergence to a local optimum is proved. This work tests the proposed method in two simulated environments, and evaluates the algorithm's performance under a linear reward function and a non-linear reward function.

40|$|The {{development}} of software-intensive systems {{is driven by}} their requirements. Traditional requirements engineering (RE) methods focus on resolving ambiguities in requirements and advocate specifying require-ments in sufficient detail so that the implementation can be checked against them for conformance. In an ideal world, {{this way of thinking}} can be very effective. Requirements can be specified clearly, updated as necessary, and evolutions of the software design can be made with the requirements in mind. Increasingly, however, it is not sufficient to fix requirements statically because they will change at runtime as the operating environment changes. Furthermore, as software systems become more pervasive, there is growing uncertainty about the environment and so requirements changes cannot be predicted at design-time [12, 24, 39, 1, 20].
