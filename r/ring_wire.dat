50|$|Circuit pairs are {{connected}} to the block with a punch-down tool by terminating the tip wire on the leftmost slot of one row and <b>ring</b> <b>wire</b> on the leftmost slot of the row beneath the mating tip wire. Typically, a 25-pair cable coming from the phone company is punched down {{on the left side of}} the block in pairs. The right hand side of the block is wired to the customer premises equipment with jumper wires. Bridging clips are used to connect the two center terminals, connecting the left-hand side of a split block with its right-hand side, thus completing the circuit. The clips form the point of interface between the subscriber and the provider. The bridging clips can be easily removed by either the subscriber or phone company personnel for trouble isolation, allowing the ability to split a circuit and determine in which direction trouble may exist. An orange insulating cover attached to a 66 block denotes its designation as a demarcation point by the local exchange carrier.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the system}} of divided ringing, the ringing circuit was {{separated}} from the talking circuit by adding a ground connection between the central office and the subscriber stations for ringing. On the same subscriber line, one party used the tip {{side of the line}} and ground for ringing, whilst the other party on the same line used the <b>ring</b> <b>wire</b> and ground for ringing, to achieve full selectivity for two-party lines, in which only the selected station would ring. These names for the wires are derived from the paired cord plugs—used on a manual switchboard—composed of three parts: the tip and the sleeve separated by a narrow metal band called the ring, each of these three components being insulated from one another. [...] In the Bell System, the two stations were thus called the tip party and the ring party, In combination with code ringing, this method could be extended to four and eight subscribers {{to reduce the number of}} disturbances. In several variations of divided ringing, also called grounded ringing, the bells were activated with polarized current, so that full selectivity was achieved for up to four parties.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{develop an}} {{approach}} to treat magnetic energy of a ferromagnet for arbitrary curved wires and shells {{on the assumption that}} the magnetostatic effects can be reduced to an effective anisotropy.

We derive an equation of magnetisation dynamics and propose a general static solution for the limit case of strong anisotropy. To illustrate our approach we consider the magnetisation structure in a <b>ring</b> <b>wire</b> and a cone surface: ground states in both systems essentially depend on the curvature excluding strictly tangential solutions even in the case of strong anisotropy.

40|$|Abstract:- In {{the course}} of an {{industrial}} research project a high-speed optical surface defect detection system was developed. The material to inspect is piston <b>ring</b> <b>wire.</b> Main condition was to continuously inspect the whole surface without slowing down the production speed of 0. 5 to 1. 5 meters per second. The minimum defect size was defined by 100 µm extension in one dimension at wire perimeters up to 40 millimeters. This leads to an amount of up to 120 megabyte of image data to acquire and process in a second. To meet this requirements on one hand fast hardware components (cameras, frame grabber) had to be utilized for grabbing the image data. On the other hand high-speed image processing algorithms had to be developed to compute features which can indicate defects out of the image data. The developed image processing algorithm is based on the computation of higher statistical moments, {{which turned out to be}} well suitable to distinguish between the gaussian distribution of the image data from faultless surface and disturbed statistical distributions in the presence of defects. The adaptation of this concept to line scan image data and the implementation on on-board processors necessitates some modifications, which result in increasing processing speed, better localization of the defects and higher sensitivity.

Measured values of undrained shear strength for both normally consolidated and overconsolidated samples were very similar using both confining systems. Samples confined with the wire reinforced membrane exhibited more strain softening beyond the peak strength and more vertical strain to the effective consolidation stress than samples confined with stacked rings.

40|$|Mechanical {{characteristics}} of orthopaedic fixators, such as stiffness and stability, directly influence the mechanobiological {{environment in which}} the bone is healed. A comprehensive understanding of the sensitivity of the Ilizarov Apparatus (IA) to configuration parameters is the key to its biomechanical analysis. In this study, detailed 3 D Finite Element (FE) models of two-ring and four-ring configurations of the IA are developed and studied with respect to axial stiffness. A parametric analysis is carried out on the four-ring configuration and the effects of the <b>ring</b> diameter, the <b>wire</b> diameter, and pretension level on the frame stiffness are studied. Both configurations are found to exhibit a non-linear stiffness behavior under axial compression. It is found that the addition of levels of fixations, i. e., <b>rings</b> and <b>wires,</b> augments fixator's stability. The analysis shows that decreasing the rings size and increasing the wires diameter and pretension levels provides greater frame stiffness.
