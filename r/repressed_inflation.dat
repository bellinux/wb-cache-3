40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to study the {{monetary}} origins of the Italian banking crisis of 1893. The Italian experience under the Gold Standard {{can be seen as}} paradoxical. Italy came back to the gold standard in 1881 and very soon after, its economy suffered inflation, asset prices inflation and a major banking crisis. Was the Gold Standard rule at the origin of the crisis? In fact, Italy came back to the gold standard after a long period of suspension of convertibility (since 1866). An international borrowing allowed the country to restore an official gold convertibility. With this international borrowing, Italy has taken commitments toward international community (especially France) to respect the constraint of the Gold Standard. Nevertheless, the structural deficit in public finance (public spending was always above the revenues of the Italian state for military reasons and infrastructure development) was not resolved. Public spending was financed by borrowing and money creation. The government managed to keep <b>inflation</b> <b>repressed</b> and used every desperate means to prevent gold to flee from Italy. These means were the restrictions to bank clearing and protectionism. The Italian government has been led to intervene more and more in the economy for easing the consequences of the inflation. The banking crisis was forwarded by inflation in assets prices (especially housing boom) and consumer prices {{at the end of the}} 1880 years. The paper explains the links between state borrowing, restrictions to bank clearing and economic crisis.

50|$|Malinvaud used disequilibrium {{analysis}} {{to develop a}} theory of unemployment. He argued that disequilibrium in the labor and goods markets could lead to rationing of goods and labor, leading to unemployment. Malinvaud adopted a fixprice framework and argued that pricing would be rigid in modern, industrial prices compared to the relatively flexible pricing systems of raw goods that dominate agricultural economies. In Malinvaud's framework, prices are fixed and only quantities adjust. Malinvaud considers an equilibrium state in classical and Keynesian unemployment as most likely. He pays less attention {{to the case of}} <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation</b> and considers underconsumption/unemployment a theoretical curiosity. Work in the neoclassical tradition is confined as a special case of Malinvaud's typology, the Walrasian equilibrium. In Malinvaud's theory, reaching the Walrasian equilibrium case is almost impossible to achieve given the nature of industrial pricing. Malinvaud's work provided different policy prescriptions depending {{on the state of the}} economy. Given Keynesian unemployment, fiscal policy could shift both the labor and goods curves upwards leading to higher wages and prices. With this shift, the Walrasian equilibrium would be closer to the actual economic equilibrium. On the other hand, fiscal policy with an economy in the classical unemployment would only make matters worse. A policy leading to higher prices and lower wages would be recommended instead.|$|E

40|$|In {{centrally}} planned economies, domestic prices do {{not respond}} flexibly to market forces, so economic disequilibria - including <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation</b> - persist. The authors assess the extent of <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation</b> in Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Romania between 1980 and 1990. First, they develop a simultaneous equation model, which stipulates that the <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation</b> {{is caused by the}} difference in growth rate between households'money holdings and retail sales in the economy. Following are the model's basic assumptions: a stable demand for money function exists where the demand for real quasi-money depends on the level of real income and the expected rate of inflation; inflationary expectations are formed under an adaptive scheme in which expected inflation for the next period depends on the error made in predicting the current period's true inflation; the real stock of quasi-money balances adjusts to the desired level, after a time lag. The authors then derive a reduced-form equation on real quasi-money holdings, and estimate it with quarterly data for Czechoslovakia and Poland, and with annual data for Romania. Based on the estimated equation, they derive the true inflation rate for each economy. Finally, they determine the significance of the <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation</b> in each economy through statistical tests on parameters of the estimated equation. These are the authors'main findings: during 1980 - 90 in Czechoslovakia, <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation</b> was insignificant, the demand for money was mostly for transaction purposes, and inflationary expectations were almost myopic; in Poland, <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation</b> was significant but decreasing after 1987, and inflationary expectations adjusted fairly rapidly; and in Romania, <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation</b> was serious throughout the period, and inflationary expectations adjusted quite rapidly. This economic model needs to be refined and the data used need to be improved. But the paper's findings are broadly consistent with the results of most other studies.

40|$|First made {{available}} online in May 2015. In Soviet-type economies inflationary pressures, often reduced but not eliminated by central planning, {{take the form}} not only of open officially recorded inflation but also of hidden inflation (i. e. a differential between official price indices and the actual cost of living to consumers) and of <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation</b> (i. e. rising excess demand {{for goods and services}} at the actual prices in the state and non-state sectors). This paper reviews inflationary trends, the persistence of inflationary pressure under central planning and definitional problems for alternative types of inflation. Estimates of hidden inflation in recent literature are reviewed and generally found to understate the price differential in the controlled and uncontrolled markets. The wide divergence between recent estimates of <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation,</b> ranging between near-equilibrium and catastrophic imbalance, is then discussed. By and large excess money holdings in {{the economy as a whole}} (i. e. with reference to the two-tier market for consumption goods) are found to be small, but this is seen as consistent with large-scale imbalance in the state sector. A model is presented illustrating the complexity and time profile of <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation</b> definitions and measurements, due to the difference between the price level which would preserve equilibrium if it had been prevailing for a sufficiently long period, and the price levels (depending on the speed of adjustment) and their time paths which can restore market clearing at single prices starting from a two-tier market in a state of imbalance. Alternative stabilisation paths and their combination are also investigated, using as policy instruments the price level, a liquid wealth tax (or currency conversion) and supply improvements. The costs of hidden and <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation</b> are discussed and found to be greater than the cost of open inflation. In sum, the task of stabilisation in Soviet-type economies is seen as large-scale, time-consuming and complex, and its implementation imperative...|$|E

40|$|In {{explaining}} {{dramatic changes}} in Chinese household savings and money demand behaviour in the reform period, previous studies proposed and tested three different hypotheses. However, no effort {{has been made to}} distinguish quantitatively between forced and voluntary savings in terms of their quanta, reasons and effects; the role of rational expectations in determining household behaviour has not received proper attention; and a puzzle of high domestic savings ratio accompanied by low interest rates still remains to be solved. This paper adopts a disequilibrium framework capable of investigating these issues. Our research yields some interesting and important results. Its findings support the conjecture that both regime shifts and <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation</b> have contributed to the rapidly rising personal money balances during the reform period, with the former being a dominant factor. It is shown that household voluntary savings can be well explained by official interest rates; only forced savings and instantaneous excess demand matter in affecting market prices, and thus monetary overhang is not so unsettling as some economists would think; and expectations do play a certain role in influencing household savings behaviour. ...|$|E

Apart from the major real economic reforms that have to take place, combined with virtual turnaround of the political structure, several countries aiming to reform face a monetary problem as well.

Monetary overhang is here defined as the excess of money supply over demand at the current price level and at world market interest rates. The consequences of the monetary overhang under a planning system are obvious: the fixity of prices prevents the real money supply from falling to its equilibrium level, and the situation of <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation</b> translates into long queues in front of shops, forced savings, and, if not checked, into a flourishing black market and corruption.

In countries that are experiencing acute macroeconomic imbalances manifested {{in the form of}} high fiscal deficits, balance of payments crisis and high open or <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation,</b> adjustment should start with policy and institutional reforms to deal wtih the ultimate causes of the macroeconomic crisis. Once enough progress has been achieved in reducing inflation and the fiscal and balance of payments deficits, other structural reforms aimed at improving resource allocation and achieving sustainable and equitable growth should be attempted. Among the latter reforms, the most common are: public sector reforms, trade/domestic competition reforms and financial sector reforms. Labour market reforms are not as common as they should be. The Bank can assist the adjustment process by providing both finance and policy advice. Furthermore, the Bank helps countries in mobilizing other sources of finance.

40|$|Surplus {{liquidity}} occurs where cashflows {{into the}} banking system persistently exceed withdrawals of liquidity from the market by the central bank. This is reflected in holdings of reserves {{in excess of the}} central bank's required reserves. The occurrence of surplus liquidity is widespread, covering many countries around the world. Historically, it has been observed most often in Soviet, wartime and transitional countries. Transitional economies, for example, often attract large capital inflows as the economy opens and undergoes privatisation. The effect of these inflows on liquidity is often magnified by central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market when there is upward pressure on the domestic currency. In the wartime economy, consumption is restricted and large amounts of involuntary savings accumulate until goods and services eventually become more widely available. Soviet-style economies have displayed widespread shortages and administered prices. This creates a situation of <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation,</b> whereby prices are too low relative to the money stock, leaving individuals with excess real balances. The importance of surplus liquidity for central banks is threefold and lies in its potential to influence: (1) the transmission mechanism of monetary policy; (2) the conduct of central bank intervention in the money market, and (3) the central bank's balance sheet and income.

40|$|During {{the second}} half of the 2000 s, the world {{experienced}} a rapid and substantial rise in commodity prices. This shock posed complex challenges for monetary policy, in particular because of the significant increase in food and energy prices, and the repercussions they had on aggregate inflation measures. This paper discusses the role of commodity price shocks (CPS) in monetary policy in the light of recent episodes of such shocks. It begins by discussing whether monetary policy should target core or headline inflation, and what should be the role of CPS in setting interest rates. It is argued that there are good reasons to focus on headline inflation, as most central banks actually do. Although core inflation provides a good indicator of underlying inflation pressures, the evolution of commodity prices should not be overlooked, because of pervasive second-round effects. This paper reviews the evidence on the rise of inflation across countries and reports that food inflation, more than energy inflation, has relevant propagation effects on core inflation. This finding is particularly important in emerging market economies, where the share of food in the consumer basket is significant. The evidence also shows that countries that had lower inflation during the run up of commodity prices before the global crisis had more inflation in the subsequent rise after the global crisis, suggesting that part of the precrisis inflationary success may have been because of <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation.</b> This paper also discusses other factors that may explain different inflationary performances across countries...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} public policy, with specific reference to public sector pricing, in an economy where all markets do not necessarily clear. The discussion focuses on three non-Walrasian market situations termed, in the nomenclature of Malinvaud and others, as: Keynesian Unemployment, Classical Unemployment and <b>Repressed</b> <b>Inflation.</b> In chapter 1, there is a brief summary of the literature in this area. The framework of the model used, is described in some detail in chapter 2. In chapter 3, {{the role of the}} traditional instruments of taxation and public expenditures is analysed in the framework of the present model. The "non-traditional" instrument of public sector pricing throws up some interesting results. Among other things, my results indicate that public sector pricing can be designed to effectively influence the level of aggregate income and employment. The method of financing the government deficit is the subject of chapter 4. My results indicate that the bond-financed multiplier of Blinder and Solow or Tobin and Buiter is simply a special case of the multiplier in my model, when the public sector enterprise prices its output at marginal cost. Equally important, I establish that the Blinder-Solow result "the long-run multiplier for bond-financed deficit spending exceeds that for money-financed deficit spending" is not necessarily true. Furthermore, the stability and convergence properties of the system are shown to rest on the choice of public sector prices. The characterisation of optimal public sector prices is dealt with in chapters 5 and 6, viewed from a different perspective in each of the chapters. In chapter 5, optimal pricing rules are derived which are explicit and readily operational. Finally, in chapter 6, we characterise the dynamic time-path of optimal public sector prices...|$|E
40|$|The strong global {{recovery}} actually disguises major regional differences. While {{growth in}} the USA, U. K. and Japan is sustained, robust and inflation-free, {{the economy in the}} remaining countries of Western Europe is progressing at a very hesitant pace. In the USA, the forecast of 3 percent for 1997 appears to be quite safe, thanks to the surprisingly high growth rate {{at the outset of the}} year; for 1998, real GDP growth is expected to slow down to 2 percent. For Japan, predictions are that the halting recovery will be followed by a growth rate of 2 ¼ percent for 1997, which should accelerate to 2 ¾ percent in 1998. After the slowdown in 1996, world trade should accelerate to a growth rate of 7 ½ percent by 1998. Europe is in the thralls of Economic and Monetary Union. Most EU member states need to make considerable efforts to meet the convergence criteria for joining the third stage of EMU. Fiscal consolidation measures have led to an amazing convergence of inflation and interest rates as well as budget balances, but at the same time collective and synchronous fiscal restrictions have substantially dampened internal demand in Europe. This further aggravated a labor market situation which, for structural reasons, was already more distressed in Europe than in the USA. With the exceptions of Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain, European countries expect to achieve growth rates of about 2 ½ percent. They hope to do slightly better next year, primarily fueled by an increase in exports and private investments. The CEE countries grow at about double the pace of those in western Europe, but their improvement is inadequate to ensure rapid transformation, delaying convergence of income levels with those in the West. Union-wide unemployment will decline only marginally until 1998, to a rate just above 10 percent, or double that of the USA. In Europe, improvement is expected to be more rapid in the U. K., the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland – exactly those countries whose growth rates are above the European average. Quiescent prices for raw materials, minor rises in wages and fiscal consolidation have effectively <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation</b> in the industrialized countries. For this and the next year, inflation should not exceed 2 ½ percent on average in most industrialized countries.

40|$|Cost {{and price}} have a {{misunderstood}} relationship. Whenever cost and price exceed expected values, public opinion wants an explanation. Usually {{it is said}} that price increases in some areas cause the increase in the price level. Additionally higher labor cost or big margins are said to be the underlying cause. But higher costs of any kind and bigger profits only imply an increase in cost and price when demand is rigid and the supply is monopolized without close substitutes, or when there is a gap in the reaction of supply to the new demand. In other cases the result is a reduction in profits, and as a reply, changes in the combination of productive factors and the {{reduction in the number of}} supplies. Labor cost is an agreed fixed cost in the most European countries and Spain. An increase in that cost exceeding an improvement in performance results in the medium term in a lower demand for labor. In the short term the result is a reduction in profits. Labor costs have absorbed around 20 % of total sales volume in non-financial enterprises in the last 20 years. Net margins of non-financial enterprises, as an average, represented 3 % of sales volume. This has several implications: Big relative changes in margins, even if the result of deliberate actions, should have a very limited impact in cost and price; empirical evidence shows that statistical correlation between cost and margins price and are negligible and show rather that price creates a good environment for entrepreneurial profits; when profits decrease, there is no influence on cost and price; and the link between cost and price and in other European countries has the same shape as in Spain. Price stability helps profits to increase. The level of profits is determined by the increase in GDP through two effects: more sales give more profits while fixed costs are spread over more sales and unit costs decrease which improve the margin: more demand pushes prices up, but only temporarily until new supply matches demand. Only when the gap between demand and supply can be covered rapidly or when monetary policy is expansive, the movement of prices can be sustained. Economic authorities have three ways to contribute to price stability: Monetary policy, control of their current expenses so to avoid a big increase in aggregate demand, and supply side policies to allow a rapid answer to changes in demand and to increased competition in markets. Changes in relative prices and cost and price are different things. Attempts so control the first create expectations of monetary stability, which help to promote economic growth. Attempts to control the second disturb the efficiency in the assignation process of productive factors and deteriorates the potential rate of GDP growth. Direct price control is condemned to failure because it means controlling the cost of productive factors and the economic activity as a whole, but requires non-available information and an intervention power that does not exist. Furthermore it results in <b>repressed</b> <b>inflation,</b> decreases in quality, double pricing and a reduction in the volume of activity. Moral admonitions have no effects at all. It is not costs that form prices but the opposite. The expectation of prices makes the entrepreneur accept costs and, if the forecast proves to be correct, the margin appears as a residual rent. To promote price stability is far better in educating consumers in order to use their purchasing power to avoid price increases than blaming activities where prices have the biggest propensity to grow...|$|E
