5000|$|Surface-mount {{technology}} {{was developed in}} the 1960s and became widely used in the mid 1980s. Much of the pioneering work in this {{technology was}} by IBM. The design approach first demonstrated by IBM in 1960 in a small-scale computer was later applied in the Launch Vehicle Digital Computer used in the Instrument Unit that guided all Saturn IB and Saturn V vehicles. Components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be directly soldered {{to the surface of the}} PCB. Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of a board became far more common with surface mounting than through-hole mounting, allowing much higher circuit densities. Often only the solder joints hold the parts to the board, in rare cases parts on the bottom or [...] "second" [...] side of the board may be secured with a dot of adhesive to keep components from dropping off inside <b>reflow</b> <b>ovens</b> if the part has a large size or weight. [...] Adhesive is sometimes used to hold SMT components on the bottom side of a board if a wave soldering process is used to solder both SMT and through-hole components simultaneously. Alternatively, SMT and through-hole components can be soldered together without adhesive if the SMT parts are first reflow-soldered, then a selective solder mask is used to prevent the solder holding the parts in place from reflowing and the parts floating away during wave soldering. Surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation, reducing labor cost and greatly increasing production rates. SMDs can be one-quarter to one-tenth the size and weight, and one-half to one-quarter the cost of equivalent through-hole parts.|$|R

40|$|Soldering of {{packaged}} {{electronic components}} using industry standard Sn-Ag-Cu (SAC) lead-free solders on low-cost foils, {{which are often}} the substrate of choice for flexible electronics, is challenging. This is mainly originating {{from the fact that}} the reflow temperatures of these solder alloys are normally higher than the maximum processing temperature of the low-cost flex foils. To enable component integration on the low-cost foils a novel method for soldering has been introduced by Holst Centre as an alternative to <b>oven</b> <b>reflow,</b> termed 'photonic soldering'. In this method high intensity photonic flashes are used to deliver the thermal energy required for soldering. By taking advantage of the selectivity of light absorption, the required energy for soldering is delivered to the components and circuit tracks while excessive heating of the foils is avoided.

The digital eco-factory has been proposed for a simultaneous examination of environmental performance, productivity and manufacturability. This paper entertains how to construct the digital eco-factory with high accuracy and usability. In general, the digital eco-factory is constructed on the virtual production line modelling an actual production line and its components. A multi-agent based construction of the digital eco-factory was applied and a trial digital eco-factory has been implemented for a PCA (Printed Circuit Assembly) line. A PCA line consists of a solder paste printer, two or three electronic part mounters, <b>reflow</b> soldering <b>oven</b> and testing machine. In the PCA line, processes for the above machines proceed in sequence, these machines’ capabilities are modelled as individual machine agents. There are several types of printed boards produced, depending {{on the number of}} mounted electronic components and the temperature of the solder. When a blank PCB (Printed Circuit Board) is input to a solder paste printing machine, the production process is started. A PCB is modelled as a part agent {{which is one of the}} product agents. For some example virtual productions, power consumption of each machine on each line from the environmental view and productivity of each machine and each line are monitored. From the results of the trial implementation, it can be said that all components on the production line could be configured as software agents with required accuracy. These agents are called “machine agents. ” In addition to machine agents, manufactured products such as workpiece and parts are also configured as software agents...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} focus on Dr. Taguchi’s Robust Engineering methodology, {{measurement}} methods and experimental results for the optimization of a lead free SMT process for use in an Automotive Electronics application. The key strategy is to find process parameters that make the process insensitive to noise factors. Traditional optimization approaches focus on maximizing the response variable while the Robust approach focuses on consistent results regardless of variation in noise factors. The Robust method was utilized {{in the development of}} a lead free process for manufacturing an Automotive SMT product. Major factors that can create variation in a lead free process were identified, including lead free solder paste brand, paste print speed, <b>oven</b> <b>reflow</b> temperatures and times, and reflow environment. Several noise factors were studied including volume of solder paste, location of components on the board, and lead frame plating materials, namely tin and palladium/nickel/gold. A series of measurements were made on the lead free product that assessed the strength and reliability of lead free solder joints, measurements such as visual scoring, cross-section, surface insulation resistance, and pull strength. Using the Robust experimental design, these measurements were optimized to create high quality and reliable lead free SMT solder joints that were the most insensitive to the noise. In essence, quality was increased by using variable measurements rather than by counting attributes (good/bad). Overall, a gain of 2. 1 dB was realized. In Robust terms, this equates to reducing variation in the lead free process by ~ 22 %. This study also revealed which of the processing factors were most significant in controlling the lead free process. The results of this study and the use of Robust Engineering methodology provide a means for developing a full range of lead free technology, components and products used on Automotive Electronics...|$|R

50|$|Graping {{occurrence}} {{has continued}} to increase since it was first identified in 2006. The viscosity of the flux decreases as {{the temperature of the}} <b>reflow</b> <b>oven</b> increases. Lead-free reflow soldering temperatures are higher which results in more graping. Graping is also caused by increased surface oxidation. The increased surface oxidation is the result of smaller printed paste deposit volumes that cause a diminished surface area to flux ratio of the solder particle resulting in flux exhaustion. While solder paste can be manufactured using any size range however there has been a move towards finer particle sizes especially for fine feature stencil printing. Finer particle sizes places added pressure on the solder paste flux to remove surface oxides which leaves the outside of the joint not fully coalesced producing the irregular surface finish known as graping.|$|E
50|$|The BGA is {{descended from}} the pin grid array (PGA), which is a package with one face covered (or partly covered) with pins in a grid pattern which, in operation, conduct {{electrical}} signals between the integrated circuit and the printed circuit board (PCB) on which it is placed. In a BGA the pins are replaced by pads {{on the bottom of}} the package, each initially with a tiny solder ball stuck to it. These solder spheres can be placed manually or by automated equipment, and are held in place with a tacky flux. The device is placed on a PCB with copper pads in a pattern that matches the solder balls. The assembly is then heated, either in a <b>reflow</b> <b>oven</b> or by an infrared heater, melting the balls. Surface tension causes the molten solder to hold the package in alignment with the circuit board, at the correct separation distance, while the solder cools and solidifies, forming soldered connections between the device and the PCB.|$|E
50|$|The {{small size}} of the exposed contacts, and the large area of exposed thermal pad {{makes it easy for}} small parts, such as 3x3 mm DFN packages, to float on the pool of molten solder under the thermal pad during assembly. This causes the parts to make no contact to the printed circuit board pads in some instances. Due to the {{excellent}} thermal characteristics of this mounting package, {{it is very hard to}} rework the device, as hot air reflow typically does not offer enough heat to the thermal pad without damage to surrounding board material or parts. Oxidation of the exposed chip contact pads after being exposed to a <b>reflow</b> <b>oven</b> during initial assembly makes solder wetting to them during rework quite difficult. Additionally there is no clearance for a soldering pencil to reflow pads under the chip if touch up is desired.

40|$|Purpose: With {{the spread}} of finer surface mounted devices it is {{important}} to understand convection reflow soldering technology more deeply. The paper compares and studies 2 D and 3 D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation results of gas flow velocity in a convection <b>reflow</b> <b>oven.</b> The aim is to show the differences of the different modelling aspects. Design/methodology/approach: Convection reflow ovens are divided into zones. Every zone contains an upper and a lower nozzle-matrix. The gas flow velocity field is one of the most important parameter of the local heat transfer in the oven. It is not possible to examine the gas flow field with classical experimental methods due to the extreme circumstances in the <b>reflow</b> <b>oven.</b> Therefore, numerical simulations are necessary. Findings: The heat transfer changes highly along the moving direction of the assembly and it is nearly homogeneous along the traverse direction of the zones. The gas flow velocity values of the 2 D model are too high due to the geometrical distortions of the 2 D model. On the other hand, the calculated flow field of the 2 D model is more accurate than in the 3 D model due to the finer mesh. Research limitations/implications: Investigating the effects of tall components on a printed wiring board inside the gas flow field and further analysis of the mesh size effect on the models. Practical implications: The presented results can be useful during the design of a simulation study in a <b>reflow</b> <b>oven</b> (or in similar processes). Originality/value: The presented results provide a completely novel approach from the aspect of 2 D and 3 D simulations of a convection <b>reflow</b> <b>oven.</b> The results also reveal the heat transfer differences. ...|$|E

As a result, manufacturers throughout the world started to look into replacing lead-based solder with lead-free pastes {{using a combination of}} alloys. During this transition, many issues have been found related to the reliability of the solder joints under a lead-free process. One of the findings is the solder cold joints effect produced by this new alloy that can potentially {{have a major impact on}} the reliability of electronic systems.

40|$|With the {{increased}} awareness of the lead free solder in the electronic packaging industry, {{the development of the}} lead free solder on the low-cost FR- 4 substrate is a necessary for the flip-chip applications. However, it is found that the high reflow temperature of the lead free solders (normally > 250 °C) caused substrate burnt related defects in the FR- 4 substrates (T g < 200 °C) during bonding process in the traditional <b>reflow</b> <b>oven.</b> In order to solve this problem, bonding was performed on the flip-chip bonder. Using this approach, no substrate burned was observed. Using the flip chip bonder instead of the <b>reflow</b> <b>oven,</b> it is a possible to solve the low T g of the FR- 4 substrate for the lead free solders flip chip applications. However, the draw back is that solder reflow data provided by solder paste suppliers must be adjusted for the flip chip bonder. In this paper, the main factors (stage temperature, bonding pressure, head temperature, bonding time and moving distance) affecting the bonding process by flip chip bonder in the Sn 0. 7 Cu lead free solder were evaluated. Sn 0. 7 Cu solder is chosen due to its high melting temperature of up to 227 °C. If we can demonstrate the solution for this high reflow temperature solder, we can apply the same approach to the others lower melting temperature solders such as SnAgCu, SnAg and SnBi on the FR- 4 substrates. The experiments were designed based on the Taguchi method. Die shear test of the bonded samples is selected as the tool to verify the die shear strength of the samples under different experiments. The S/N ratio is used to determine the optimum conditions for the bonding by the flip chip bonder.

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 As {{the drive}} {{continues}} {{to reduce the}} size of Printed Wiring Assemblies (PWAs), improve performance of electronic assemblies, and reduce costs of these products, reliable secondary (bottom) side reflow operations must be developed. Attaching Surface Mount Technology (SMT) components to the secondary side of a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) is accomplished by placing components on the PCB's secondary side and processing it through the <b>reflow</b> <b>oven</b> at this point. This board is then flipped over so that more components can be placed on the side that is facing up (primary side). The PCB must again be processed through the <b>reflow</b> <b>oven.</b> Large Integrated Circuit (IC) packages that are soldered to the secondary side fall off of the PCB during reflow of the primary side. Intuition may lead one to believe this is caused solely by weight, size, etc., but experienced personnel are not able to consistently predict which components will fail. The purpose of this work is to convey the necessary knowledge to explain and predict the behavior of components during Secondary Side Reflow (SSR). This thesis will ultimately present a method by which guidelines for SSR can be created. Currently, SSR is limited to small passive devices and small Integrated Circuit (IC) packages. It is anticipated that future PWA designs will require large ICs such as Quad Flat Packs (QFP) and Ball Grid Arrays (BGA) on the secondary side. A large variety of SMT components are available, but the focus of this research was directed towards large IC packages. Current manufacturing guidelines for such products do not exist and development of these are imperative if a costly trial and error approach is to be avoided. In an environment where product technology advancement and cost reduction are key to survival, industry must develop and understand this manufacturing process. Cost savings from SSR will be most directly realized with compressed product development cycles, reduced use of PCBs, components, and raw materials, and more efficient use of manufacturing capital and employees. These cost savings would be realized nearly immediately after a set of manufacturing guidelines is developed...|$|E
