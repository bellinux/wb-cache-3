40|$|Production of {{spheroidal}} graphite cast iron is today quite mastered technology. There are many methods achieving the nodular graphite morphology. Each {{of these methods}} have specific characteristics and requirements to technical support, properties and the type of applied modifier. Selection of the spheroidization method is dependent on foundry disposition, production character, economic balance, quality requirements, etc. In case of centrifugally casting the core, which fills body and neck of the roll, is created by ductile iron. Considering the sophisticated production of centrifugally cast <b>rolls</b> <b>for</b> hot <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> it is necessary to ensure a high reproducibility and reliability of ductile cast iron production quality in the bulk range of 9 - 18 t per tapping.

40|$|Thermal fatigue {{represents}} {{one of the most significant}} causes <b>for</b> roughing mill <b>roll</b> deterioration and possible failure. The materials ability to withstand thermal cycling is strictly correlated to its microstructural properties, which are the result of the solidification process and following heat treatment. <b>Rolls</b> <b>for</b> hot strip <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> are usually produced by centrifugal casting, without subsequent forging. A crucial role is played by the eutectic carbide network developing on solidification, which represents a preferential pattern for crack propagation. For this reason conventional highly alloyed HSS are not a popular substitute for traditional Chromium steel rolls in rougher stands. The so- called “semi-HSS”, containing less C (0. 7 - 0. 9 %C) and alloying elements are usually preferred by users requiring improved roll material. Specially developed “HSS for roughers ” are being tested in various mills, but they are out of the scope of this paper. The present work is part of a continuing effort by INNSE Cilindri (RIVA Group) and Trento University to improve the “semi HSS ” grades. In particular the thermal fatigue resistance of a new class of low-C semi HSS is evaluated. For purpose of comparison, both a conventional semi-HSS and a HSS grade were also considered. The test is based on induction heating (Tmax= 670 °C) and water cooling of cylindrical discs. Experimental results confirm the lower susceptibility towards heat checking of the new grades, containing reduced amount of eutectic carbides, the best behaviour being exhibited by a steel with a mixed martensite-bainite matrix microstructure.

40|$|International audienceThe ceramic {{coatings}} deposited by Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD) {{are known}} for their high hardness. They offer a wide variety of friction coefficients. They have been used {{for a number of years}} for the coating of cutting tools; they have shown high efficiency in this field. Considering this, some of these coatings might prove efficient in the field of metal rolling. Yet to the best of the authors' knowledge, they have never been used industrially <b>for</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> <b>rolls.</b> TiBN is one of the PVD coatings with the highest hardness. It is also known for its anti-adhesive property. In this study, the interest of TiBN in cold rolling is analyzed. In this application, the potential productivity is determined by the maximum pair (reduction, speed) above which seizure and transfer degrade tribological properties. The fatigue resistance is also studied and therefore, the potential influence of the coating on the roll life under conditions similar to those of rolling. Two well adapted tribological tests have been used for these two purposes: a plate-on-ring test, and a twin-disk Amsler test.

40|$|Abstract — {{the process}} of plastic {{deformation}} of metal by passing it through the rolls called as the metal rolling. Rolling is widely used forming process, which can have high production figures and precise control of final product. Rolling is classified in two major parts the cold rolling and hot rolling. Every part has its own theory, development of rolling process and subsequently the designing of the cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> components, like rolls and <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing. The aim of the present paper is to understand the various methodologies which are used to design the cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill.</b> We {{have focused on the}} history of the rolling process; it is understand that the rolling process was adopted since year 1590. Although it was raw method but it initiated the slitting <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> and the actual experimentation were started from year 1670. In those days rolling was concerned with rolling of bars only after few years the rolling of bars were started. We also tried to discuss the earlier patents which were granted in 18 th century and was related to the tandem mill which were using copper and brass as the rolling materials. In year 1783, after the entry of grooved rolls the rolling production increased up to 15 times and that was the start of modern <b>rolling</b> <b>mill.</b> While reviewing the design of <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> components our area of interest is to visit design of rollers and <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing. We have discussed the different parameters and factors that affect the roll design. The calculations for the power required <b>for</b> <b>rolling</b> operation and the roll dimensions are also discussed. In reviewing the design of <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing, we try to explain the load that comes on the rolls during the rolling operations and how it affects the bearing life. The <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing designed optimisation has achieved by using different Finite Element Analysis techniques and various experimentation <b>for</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing structural analysis is also reviewed...|$|R

By dynamic surface control method, we design the controller to guarantee stabilization of the cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> system. Furthermore, we extend proposed method to general high-order systems, in which we analyze the difference from cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> system.
