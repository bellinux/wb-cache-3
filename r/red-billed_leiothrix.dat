50|$|Birds at Naina Devi Himalayan Bird Conservation Reserve include species {{like the}} hill partridge, chukar partridge, koklass pheasant, kalij pheasant, goldcrest, rufous sibia, <b>red-billed</b> <b>leiothrix,</b> black-chinned babbler, chestnut-bellied nuthatch, black-throated tit, rock bunting, green-tailed sunbird and yellow-breasted greenfinch. Some {{endangered}} birds like the bearded vulture and Himalayan griffon {{can also be}} seen here.|$|E
50|$|The leiothrix is an {{open cup}} nester. The nests of the <b>red-billed</b> <b>leiothrix</b> are {{composed}} of dry leaves, moss and lichen; however, they are not well hidden because concealment isn't really a primary factor when determining a nest site. Several nests are found between April and June and are placed within ten feet of the ground. Dense vegetation provides the shrub nesting species protection against predators.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the species}} {{that can be easily}} seen are scarlet ibis and {{bleeding}} heart doves, named after the red spot of feathers on their chests. But if you look more closely in the tree, you may see a boat-billed heron looking for fish or a tanager feeding on fruit. Masked lovebirds can be heard calling, <b>red-billed</b> <b>leiothrix</b> will dart at eye level looking for insects, and pygmy geese swim in the stream.|$|E
50|$|Known hosts {{for this}} species include the warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus), the {{blackbird}} (Agelaius phoeniceus), the goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis), the blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), the yellow warbler (Setophaga petechia), the robin (Erithacus rubecula), junco (Junco hyemalis hyemalis), the <b>red-billed</b> <b>leiothrix</b> (Leiothrix lutea), the bullfinch (Loxigilla violacea), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), the weaver (Ploceus cucullatus), the grackle (Quiscalus quiscula), the canary (Serinus canaria), the blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla), the pigeon (Spilopelia senegalensis), eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), starling (Sturnus vulgaris) black-faced grassquit (Tiaris bicolor), white-eyed thrush (Turdus jamaicensis), the blackbird (Turdus merula) and American sparrows (Zonotrichia species).|$|E
50|$|The {{silver-eared mesia}} is a {{seasonal}} breeder, with the season lasting from November to August, although the season starts later, in April, {{in the northern}} part of its range. Both the male and female are involved in building the nest, a deep cup of bamboo and other dead leaves lined with rootlets and fern fibres. The nest takes about four days to construct and is placed near ground level or up to 2m up in a bush. Underlying its relationship with the <b>red-billed</b> <b>leiothrix</b> the nest is said to be indistinguishable from the one of that species.|$|E
5000|$|Some South and Middle American Turdus thrushes {{are also}} named as robins {{such as the}} {{rufous-collared}} robin. The Australian [...] "robin redbreast", more correctly the scarlet robin (Petroica multicolor), is {{more closely related to}} the crows and jays than it is to the European robin. It belongs to the family Petroicidae, commonly called [...] "Australasian robins". The <b>red-billed</b> <b>leiothrix</b> (Leiothrix lutea) is sometimes named [...] "Pekin robin" [...] by aviculturalists. Another group of Old World Flycatchers, this time from Africa and Asia, is the genus Copsychus; its members are known as magpie-robins, one of which, the Oriental magpie robin (C. saularis), is the national bird of Bangladesh.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-billed</b> <b>leiothrix</b> (Leiothrix lutea) is {{a member}} of the family Leiothrichidae, native to {{southern}} China and the Himalayas. Adults have bright red bills and a dull yellow ring around their eyes. Their backs are dull olive green, and they have a bright yellow-orange throat with a yellow chin; females are somewhat duller than males, and juveniles have black bills. It has also been introduced in various parts of the world, with small populations of escapees having existed in Japan since the 1980s. It has become a common cagebird and amongst aviculturists it goes by various names: Pekin robin, Pekin nightingale, Japanese nightingale, and Japanese (hill) robin, the last two being misnomers as it is not native to Japan.|$|E
50|$|The {{omnivorous}} Hawaiian crow is a generalist species, eating various foods as {{they become}} available. The main portion of their diet, and 50% of their feeding activity is spent foraging on trunks, branches, and foliage for invertebrates such as isopods, land snails, and arachnids. They feed in a woodpecker fashion, flaking bark and moss from trunks or branches to expose hidden insects, foraging mostly on ohia and koa, the tallest and most dominant trees in their habitats. Fruits are the second most dominant component in the Hawaiian crow's diet. The crows often collect kepau and olapa fruit clusters. Although hoawa and alani fruits have hard outer coverings, crows continue to exert energy prying them open. Passerine nestlings and eggs are consumed most frequently in April and May, during their breeding season. Other prey include <b>red-billed</b> <b>leiothrix,</b> Japanese white-eye, Hawaiʻi ʻamakihi, ʻIʻiwi, ‘elepaio, and ʻapapane. The alalā also commonly forages on flowers, especially from February through May. Nectar to feed the young are obtained from the ohia flower, oha kepau, and purple poka during the nestling period. Crows also foraged various plant parts, including the flower petals of kolea, koa, and mamane. The palila is the only other Hawaiian bird known to eat flower petals. The alalā only occasionally forages on the ground, {{but only for a}} limited amount of time for risk of predators.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Leiothrix</b> (Leiothrix lutea) is an {{invasive}} species which {{has recently been}} found to be locally abundant in eastern Liguria (Italy). The song production of this bird was recorded over the course of an entire year (2011) and evaluated using both aural information and applying innovative automatic processing metrics. Our findings revealed that the <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Leiothrix</b> has loud vocalizations that are heard for most of the year, including in July and August when other birds are silent. Its song production has been estimated to amount to 37 % of the sounds uttered by the entire bird community. The next most vocal species are the European Robin (36 %), the Common Blackbird (18 %), the Subalpine Warbler (5 %) and the Sardinian Warbler (1 %). The <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Leiothrix</b> {{can be seen as a}} new acoustically dominant species and, consequently, a potential modifier of the soundscape patterns of the indigenous bird community. The modification of acoustic traits in the repertoire of both indigenous species and the <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Leiothrix</b> is to be expected according to a co-evolution hypothesis...|$|E

The Kilauea Forest Reserve is notable for the island of Hawaii because it provides habitat for at least nine species of endemic birds, of which six species are members of the Hawaiian Honeycreeper family (Drepanididae) : Amakihi, Akepa, Creeper, Akiapolaau, Apapane, and Iiwi. The other endemic species are the Hawaiian Hawk, the Elepaio, and the Hawaiian Thrush. The thrush is abundant throughout the forest, and is common even in areas that have been disturbed by cattle and by logging operations. Two species of introduced birds occur in relatively large numbers: Japanese White-eye and <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Leiothrix.</b> Other species of introduced birds are found in the pasture land adjacent to the forest but have not been seen within the forest itself. The foraging behavior of endemic and introduced species is discussed. No data are available to suggest that introduced species compete with endemic birds for food or for nesting sites. Nesting data are presented. An apparently unusual feature about the Apapane is that this species not uncommonly builds its nest on the tops of tree fern fronds, rather than in ohia trees, which is the typical site for nests of this species in ohia-tree fern forests. The adaptability of three endemic species (Elepaio, Amakihi, Akiapolaau) and two introduced species (Japanese White-eye, <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Leiothrix)</b> to wide vegetational and climatic conditions is discussed...|$|E

We investigated the best method to accurately sex the species, capturing and measuring the colour and external morphometry of a sample of 57 individuals, which were later sexed molecularly from blood samples. We found that sexes showed no dimorphism in biometry or size of wing coloured-patches. However, a Discriminant Function based on hue of the throat, chroma of the crown and lightness of the breast allowed us to determine sex with an accuracy of 91 %. © 2013 Copyright British Trust for Ornithology.

40|$|Non-native {{amphibians}} often {{compete with}} native amphibians in their introduced range, but their competitive effects on other vertebrates are less well known. The Puerto Rican coqui frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui) has colonized {{the island of}} Hawaii, and has been hypothesized to compete with insectivorous birds and bats. To address if the coqui could compete with these vertebrates, we used stable isotope analyses to compare the trophic position and isotopic niche overlap between the coqui, three insectivorous bird species, and the Hawaiian hoary bat. Coquis shared similar trophic position to Hawaii amakihi, Japanese white-eye, and <b>red-billed</b> <b>leiothrix.</b> Coquis were about 3 ‰ less enriched in δ 15 N than the Hawaiian hoary bat, suggesting the bats feed at a higher trophic level than coquis. Analyses of potential diet sources between coquis {{and each of the}} three bird species indicate that there was more dietary overlap between bird species than any of the birds and the coqui.

40|$|A {{variety of}} Habronematidae parasites (order Spirurida) have been {{described}} as occasional parasites of avian species; however, reports on passerines are relatively uncommon. From 2007 to 2008, 11 passerine deaths at The North Carolina Zoological Park in Asheboro, NC, USA, were associated with ventricular habronemiasis, which was determined to be the cause of death or a major contributing factor in 10 of the 11 individuals. The number and species affected were 5 <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Leiothrix</b> (Leiothrix lutea), 2 Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus), 2 Golden-headed Manakin (Pipra erythrocephala), 1 Blue-grey Tanager (Thraupis episcopus), and 1 Emerald Starling (Coccycolius iris). Affected animals displayed nonspecific clinical signs or were found dead. The ventricular nematodes were consistent in morphology with Procyrnea sp. Koilin fragmentation with secondary bacterial and fungal infections was the most frequently observed pathologic lesion. Secondary visceral amyloidosis, attributed to chronic inflammation associated with nematodiasis, was present in 4 individuals. An insect intermediate host is suspected but was not identified. Native passerine species within or around the aviary may be serving as sylvatic hosts...|$|E

The dominant and subdominant plants are listed for 10 major vegetational and climatic areas within Volcanoes National Park. These areas are located at elevations between 1, 400 and 10, 000 feet. Information on the birds found in eight of the 10 areas during the late 1940 s is available in the paper by Baldwin (1953); two of Baldwin's study plots are not included in the IBP transects, but data on the birds in these plots from 1970 - 1972 are included in this report. Notable differences between bird populations in the 1940 s and the early 1970 s are: 1. The apparent disappearance from the Park of two species of rare and endangered honeycreepers: Akiapolaau and Ou; 2. An apparent disappearance of the Apapane from certain low-elevation habitats; 3. A decrease in the range, and probably in population density, of the Elepaio; 4. The disappearance of the Hawaiian Thrush from at least two plots at low elevations; 5. A reversal in density of the <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Leiothrix</b> and the Japanese White-eye. The White-eye was first recorded in certain regions of the Park between 1940 and 1944. It now is found at nearly all levels and in all habitats within the Park from sea level to above tree line, and it is now the most common exotic species in the Park. The <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Leiothrix</b> is now common in suitable habitat, but population density probably is lower than during the 1940 s. 6. The Hawaiian Goose now occurs regularly within Park boundaries, especially during the breeding season; the species was close to extinction during the 1940 s and was not seen by Baldwin. The discovery that the Apapane sometimes build nests in collapsed lava tubes is discussed. That this type of nesting behavior is not rare is suggested because it was found on Mt. Hualalai and at three widely separated sites on Mauna Loa. At least three species of Plasmodium, the protozoan parasite that causes bird malaria, have been identified in the blood of one endemic (Apapane) and two introduced (Leiothrix and White-eye) species of birds in Volcanoes National Park. Studies on the mosquito vector for Plasmodium are needed. Baldwin's (1953) thorough study of the insect food of the Amakihi, Apapane, and Iiwi is summarized, as is his discussion of the phenology of the tree species whose flowers provide nectar for the honeycreepers. The need for contemporary observations on the relationship of the Iiwi to lobeliad flowers is noted...|$|E

A survey for forest birds was conducted in Kalaupapa National Historical Park in 2005 to determine presence-absence and abundance. Forest bird surveys were conducted using the variable circular plot method. Survey stations were established 140 m apart along six transects of variable length. Stations were surveyed for birds from March – May 2005. Also included in the analysis are data from a Hawaii Forest Bird Survey in 2004 for two transects located in the park. Of the nine native species that once inhabited the island, only three remain: We detected the Apapane (Himatione sanguinea), Iiwi (Vestiaria coccinea) and Maui Amakihi (Hemignathus virens wilsoni). As on other islands, Molokai now supports a number of non-native birds including: the Barn Owl (Tyto alba), Black Francolin (Francolinus francolinus), Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis), House Finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), Japanese Bush-warbler (Cettia diphone), Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus), Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Nutmeg Mannikin (Lonchura punctulata), <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Leiothrix</b> (Leiothrix lutea), Skylark (Alauda arvensis), Spotted Dove (Streptopelia chinensis), and White-rumped Shama (Copsychus malabaricus).

Ka'āpahu, Haleakalā National Park was acquired by the National Park Service in 1999. Inventories of vegetation, forest birds, and non-native mammals in this newly acquired area were identified as a priority for the National Park Service. To satisfy the forest bird and non-native mammal inventories, presence or absence and distribution surveys were conducted in 2002. A follow-up forest bird survey was conducted in May 2005. Results of the forest bird surveys showed the presence of four native forest bird species: Maui 'Amakihi (Hemignathus virens wilsoni), Maui 'Alauahio (Paroreomyza montana newtoni), 'I'iwi (Vestiaria coccinea), and 'Apapane (Himatione sanguinea sanguinea). Five alien forest bird species were detected: the Japanese Bush-warbler (Cettia diphone), Hwamei (Garrulax canorus), <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Leiothrix</b> (Leiothrix lutea), Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus), and Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis). No endangered bird species were detected. Results suggest that non-native Japanese Bush-warbler, Hwamei and Japanese White-eye may be expanding their range. Results of the non-native mammals survey showed presence of black rats (Rattus rattus), small Indian mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus), feral pigs (Sus scrofa), axis deer (Axis axis), and feral goats (Capra hircus) throughout the transect. We did not capture or record signs of Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), Polynesian rats (Rattus exulans), mice (Mus musculus), dogs (Canis lupus), or feral cats (Felis catus) during the survey. However, based on information in other areas throughout the park and on Maui it is very likely that all of these animals occur in Ka'āpahu. The Haleakalā National Park and the National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring program, Pacific Island Network funded this project. This inventory was carried out under a cooperative agreement (Task Agreement No. CA 8012 -AO- 001) between the National Park Service, Pacific Island Network and the Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit, University of Hawai'i at Mānoa...|$|E
