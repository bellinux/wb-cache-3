40|$|Process {{water from}} <b>recovered</b> <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> {{recycling}} operations is often discarded from papermill operations because even low percentages of hydrophobic contaminants, such as stickies, {{are a problem}} to papermakers. This study compared the use of dissolved air flotation (DAF) and a high shear field (HSF) separator for removing a pressuresensitive/hot-melt adhesive (PSA/HMA) from process water. The adhesive was applied to dried pulp sheets, pulped, and then screened for subsequent preparation of low-consistency process water. An experimental DAF cell (about 200 L/min) was constructed and used to compare with an experimental HSF separator (about 40 L/min). Total stickie removal efficiency of the DAF cell was between 83 % and 84 %. Total stickie removal efficiency of the HSF separator was improved to about 60 % for all stickie sizes measured by adding dissolved air and flocculating polymers. The HSF separator performed best (about 80 % total stickie removal efficiency) when calcium hydroxide {{was added to the}} feed without dissolved air or with the addition of dual polymer flocculating polymers. Although fiber loss was not optimized for the HSF separator, it was about half that measured for the DAF cell. We expect to improve both the DAF cell operation and the HSF by adding more dissolved air capacity. We also intend to investigate the effect of pacifying stickies by precipitating calcium carbonate with carbon dioxide after the addition of calcium hydroxide...|$|E

40|$|This {{study shows}} {{the effects of}} cassava starch as binder on the {{flexural}} strength and the water absorptivity properties of cassava starch bonded <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> based composites. <b>Paper</b> <b>pulp</b> was produced by chopping waste papers into smaller pieces and soaked in water for 2 weeks after which it was pulverized in the grinding machine to form <b>paper</b> <b>pulp.</b> The starch slurry was prepared with boiled water and stirred properly to produce lumps free starch slurry. The starch slurry after cooling was preserved in a container. The composites were developed by forming the homogeneous pastes from the mixture of starch with white and brown papers slurry, respectively in predetermined proportions. The developed composites were allowed to cure at room temperature in the laboratory for 28 days after which flexural and water absorptivity tests were carried out on the samples. It was deduced from the work that both white and brown <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> based composites possessed improved properties than the control sample which was without starch.

The <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> compression molding material {{is one of}} the most commonly used materials in packing industry. Their mechanical properties attract attentions from professional visitors and researchers. It is a difficult work to test the mechanical properties as the <b>paper</b> <b>pulps</b> are thin, anisotropic and sometimes wet.

40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{improving}} the energy efficiency of fluidized bed sludge incinerators were evaluated. The first method used <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> and polymer as conditioning agents for municipal sludge instead of lime and ferric chloride. Automatic control of the incinerator was the second method evaluated for energy savings. To evaluate the use of <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> and polymer as conditioning agents, varying quantities of <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> {{were added to the}} liquid sludge to determine the optimal sludge-to-paper pulp ratio. The effect of the <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> and polymer-conditioned sludge on plant operations also was evaluated. When compared to sludge conditioned with lime and ferric chloride, the <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> and polymer-conditioned sludge had similar cake release and feed characteristics, higher BTU values for the dry sludge solids, required less auxiliary fuel for incineration, and generated less ash for disposal. The <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> and polymer did not have any appreciable negative effects on the operation of the wastewater treatment plant. It was estimated that processing and incinerating the sludge conditioned with <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> and polymer resulted in a cost savings of up to $ 91. 73 per dry ton of activated sludge solids. To evaluate the effect of automatic control, all the incinerator operating parameters including air flow rates, fuel oil feed rates, and sludge feed rates, were automatically monitored and controlled to minimize auxiliary fuel oil use and to keep the incinerator running at optimal conditions. Although effective, the estimated cost savings for automatic control of the incinerator were small...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic mono-digestion and {{co-digestion}} {{of primary}} sludge and two organic wastes (namely food waste or <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> reject) {{were evaluated by}} biomethane potential assessment and kinetics modelling to elucidate the synergistic effect. The specific methane yields were 159, 652 and 157 mL/g VS added during mono-digestion of primary sludge, food waste and <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> reject, respectively. Co-digestion of primary sludge with either food waste or <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> reject resulted in much higher specific methane yields of 799 and 368 mL/g VS, respectively. pH and intermediate inhibitions (e. g. volatile fatty acids and ammonium-N) were not observed. The synergistic effect was also confirmed by examining the VS and COD removals. COD balance also identified and validated the enhanced specific methane yields from both primary sludge and organic waste (i. e. additional 32 and 19 % of COD was converted to biogas during co-digestion of primary sludge with food waste or <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> reject, respectively). The apparent first order rate constant derived from kinetics modelling increased from 0. 18 to 0. 63 d− 1 during mono-digestion of <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> reject and co-digestion of primary sludge with <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> reject, which {{can be attributed to}} the initial high soluble biodegradable fraction in primary sludge...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The waste {{corrugated}} paper was grinded to <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> first, {{and then the}} <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> was used to prepare the foamed waste paper pulp/high density polyethylene（HDPE）composites by compression molding with HDPE. The Rosand double-barrel capillary rhepmeter was used to investigate the influences of the blowing agent AC(Azodicarbonamide) content，waste <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> content，temperature and different blowing agent on the melt of the composites. Scanning electron microscopy（SEM）was also used to characterize the effects of different contents of AC and waste <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> on the cell morphologies. The results showed that: when the shear rate goes up to 600 S- 1 ，the melt performances of the foamed waste <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> / HDPE composites were pseudoplastic flow, and turn up wall slip phenomenon. The viscosity of melt was significantly reduced with the content of AC increasing, but it increased with {{the content of the}} waste <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> increased. When the shear rate reduced to 275 S- 1 or below, the viscosity of melt reduced as the temperature raised; while when the shear rate went up to 275 S- 1 or high, the viscosity of melt increased as the temperature raised. When the shear rate reduced to 325 S- 1 or below, the melt of endothermic blowing agent （NaHCO 3 ）showed the highest viscosity; when the shear rate went up to 325 S- 1 or high, the melt of exothermic blowing agent AC shows the highest viscosity. The number of cell increased and size of cell became smaller with the AC content increasing, but the number of cell reduced and the size of cell became larger with the content of waste <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> increased observing by SEM...|$|R

To reinforce this hypothesis, this study compares in vitro development of nemesia on several substrates. Strong differences between nemesia roots growing in agar or in paper-pulp substrates were evidenced through scanning electron microscopy. Roots developed in agar have shorter hairs, larger rhizodermal cells, and less organized root caps than those growing on <b>paper</b> <b>pulp.</b> In conclusion, {{it should be noted}} that in this study, in vitro microporous substrates such as <b>paper</b> <b>pulp</b> lead to the production of similar root hairs to those found in greenhouse peat substrates.
