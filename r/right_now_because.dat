500|$|As customary, {{the game}} {{began with the}} first of two rounds in which contestants {{answered}} questions to earn spins for the [...] "Big Board"; a correct buzz-in answer earned three spins, while a correct multiple-choice answer earned one spin. Larson's memorization of the patterns could not help him here, and he struggled early. On the second question, host Peter Tomarken asked, [...] "You've probably got President Franklin D. Roosevelt in your pocket or purse <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> his likeness is on the head side". Larson buzzed in at this point and answered, [...] "$50 bill", after which Tomarken finished the question [...] "of what American coin?" [...] with the answer being [...] "a dime"; the other choice was [...] "a nickel". He did not buzz in again, answering the last two questions multiple choice and finishing with three spins, behind Long's four and Litras's ten. With the fewest spins, Larson went first. On his first spin, he hit a Whammy; however, on his next two, he hit square #4 for $1,250 and finished the round with $2,500. Long and Litras finished the round without a Whammy and won $4,080 and $4,608, respectively, putting Larson in last place.|$|E
500|$|Because of RCA's {{leniency}} in the end, the band's departure was peaceful despite complications, {{and they}} still hold respect for RCA for what the label allowed them to do. Heppner credits the label for allowing the record that RCA funded to go to some other company who would want it instead, while Watchorn acknowledges that recent economic troubles would have mandated that record labels only keep [...] "the {{things that are going}} to sell" [...] on their rosters. Heppner noted that labels usually shelve albums permanently if they are deemed unfit for commercial sale rather than give them to the artists who recorded them, and that the band were [...] "really, really lucky" [...] in comparison. Priestess found and signed with New York City independent record label Tee Pee Records to replace RCA in late 2009; Tee Pee Records had offered to sign the group years earlier, but the band chose RCA over Tee Pee. They enjoy being signed to Tee Pee Records rather than RCA, where they feel more [...] "at home". The band have stated that they feel less pressure to succeed on Tee Pee Records, and they do not feel any less important to the label compared to its higher-profile artists, such as American Idol contestants. [...] "Tee Pee is the perfect label for us <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> they totally understand what we want to do," [...] Heppner stated. [...] "I am alas [...] stoked to be labelmates with so many wicked bands." [...] He additionally noted that the only advantage the band had when signed to RCA was more money, and that having a different kind of music meant that Priestess were not as lucrative as a band such as the Foo Fighters, who were more heavily promoted.|$|E

And if people don’t start having more children, they’re going to have a vastly diminished workforce to support a huge aging population." [...] China's ratio is about five working adults to one retiree; the huge retiree community must be supported, and that will dampen future growth, according to Fong.|$|R

After the race, Bob Pockrass, a reporter with the Sporting News, asked Busch if being on probation made an impact during the Nationwide Series race. Busch replied [...] "It refrains me from not beating {{the shit out of}} you <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>because</b> you ask me stupid questions.

2500|$|Stephen Sundlof, {{director}} of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, says [...] "Melamine is not very toxic as a chemical, so we're wondering why {{we are seeing the}} kinds of serious conditions, especially the kidney failure, that we're seeing in cats and dogs... We are focusing on the melamine <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>because</b> we believe that, even if melamine is not the causative agent, it is somehow associated with the causative agent, so it serves as a marker". Even at the highest observed concentrations found in wheat gluten, the melamine exposure is much smaller than the rat and mouse doses for which effects were seen. Instead, the FDA has suggested a second contaminant may be responsible for the ill effects and melamine, as the most easily identifiable contaminant, may serve as a biomarker, or indicator, for contaminated wheat gluten.|$|E

40|$|Paul Watson's 12 -part {{documentary}} serial, The Family (BBC, 1974), {{focused on}} the lives of the working-class Wilkins family from Reading. Along with An American Family (PBS, 1973), The Family has been positioned as a landmark precursor to reality TV. Yet it has largely been referred to rather than analysed, and the potential relationship at work between `then' and `now' is often obscured. In seeking to (re) construct the popular reception of The Family, this article argues that it is particularly productive to `revisit' the Wilkinses <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> precisely <b>because</b> the growth of reality TV has led to an `opening up' of the traditional terrain of documentary studies. Drawing on new archival research, this article examines how discussion of the programme generated an expansive extratextual framework. This framework turned The Family into a cultural event, and it represents a crucial site for accessing its historical circulation — particularly with regard to discourses on `ordinary' people as television performers, and `ordinary' people turned television `stars'...|$|R

Alex Ferguson regarded him highly as a player while he played in the Premier League, saying it is fair to compare him to Paul Scholes because both are intelligent footballers with good passing consistencies, control of the game, and fairplay. Slaven Bilić said Modrić [...] "is a player who makes others better, they all benefit from him being in the team. He's not selfish, he's playing for the team...he's a complete player; good in defence, good in offence—it looks like he was born with the ball at his feet".

After four years he quit the job as he [...] "didn't want to sound angry all the time" [...] and {{returned}} to Chennai where his family and friends were living. He joined at BIG FM 92.7 because they gave him freedom to plan and design his four-hour slot; thus the show Take it Easy was conceived. The evening prime-time show was created to give people a [...] "break from the serious stuff that {{they have to deal with}} during work hours and relax with the nonsense". Balaji created another segment in Take it Easy, titled Cross Talk, where he made prank calls to unsuspecting victims, nominated by a friend, cousin, co-worker or neighbour. On how the segment developed, Balaji said, [...] "I was assigned to do a serious socially-relevant show in the beginning but Big FM gave me the chance to talk about anything in Take It Easy. Once when I was talking to a couple about something serious, people who listened found it funny. That's how Cross Talk happened".
