40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the competitiveness and improve the environmental performance of district heating in the future, it is essential to transition to lower operating temperatures than those of current third-generation district heating systems. Heat demands are expected to decrease as buildings become more energy efficient, and new types of heat sources are likely to be integrated. Therefore, future supply and <b>return</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 50 – 55 °C and 20 – 30 °C, have been suggested for the fourth-generation district heating systems.

40|$|The studies {{presented}} in this thesis concern hydronic space heating systems connected via heat exchangers to a district heating network: referred to as an indirect connection. The objective has been to improve the reliability of district heat supplies and to lower the <b>return</b> <b>temperature</b> from consumer substations. Two of the disadvantages of an indirect connection have been addressed: the thermodynamic loss and the local dependency on electricity involved during {{the use of a}} heat exchanger. The results show that the influence of these disadvantages can be reduced by employing several variants of so-called low-flow procedures in hydronic heating systems. Concerning the reliability of district heat supplies, the present work has led to new knowledge regarding the dependence of the district heating technology on electricity. A substantial heat supply can be maintained in numerous buildings in case of an electric power failure since natural circulation can be expected to take place in the heating systems. A turbine-driven circulation pump has the potential to further reduce the dependence on electricity.

The work contains a detailed classification of materials using the latent heat of organic and inorganic PCM. This references the technical possibilities of existing heat storage technologies. A specific objective was adopted to determine the effect of using heat storage with PCM on inlet and outlet temperatures in substation in district heating systems. The scope of the study included determining the parameters of the heat distribution network as a function of an outdoor air temperature within the range of - 20 °C to + 12 °C. The object of analysis was chosen to be the heating system parameters: supply 120 °C and return 60 °C. It is located on the surface of 160 km 2, and supplies heat to 240, 000 residents.

We compare six different radiation management schemes that use surface, troposphere, and stratosphere interventions in a single climate model in which we projected future climate from 2020 to 2099 based on RCP 4. 5. We analyze the surface air temperature responses to determine how effective the schemes are at <b>returning</b> <b>temperature</b> to its 1986 – 2005 climatology and analyze precipitation responses to compare side effects. We find crop albedo enhancement is largely ineffective at <b>returning</b> <b>temperature</b> to its 1986 – 2005 climatology. Desert albedo enhancement causes excessive cooling in the deserts and severe shifts in tropical precipitation. Ocean albedo enhancement, sea-spray geoengineering, cirrus cloud thinning, and stratospheric SO 2 injection have the potential to cool more uniformly, but cirrus cloud thinning may not be able to cool by much more than 1 K globally.
