In the early grades, measurement activities develop students 2 ̆ 7 understanding of the properties of objects as well as what it means to measure objects. Hands-on activities can enable students to explore such measurable properties as height and length, and direct comparisons of various objects provide opportunities for students to gain a conceptual foundation of measurement before using standardized tools such as rulers and metersticks. In this article, the authors present several activities that develop measurement skills in young learners, particularly in first and second grades. Students complete the activities individually but collaborate with peers as they discuss their experiences and observations together.

40|$|We present two {{complementary}} improvements for abstract-interpretation-based {{flow analysis}} of higher-order languages: (1) abstract garbage collection and (2) abstract counting. 1, 2 Abstract garbage collection is an analog to its concrete counterpart: the analysis determines when an <b>abstract</b> <b>resource</b> has become unreachable, and then reallocates it as fresh. This prevents flow sets from joining during abstract interpretation, which has two immediate effects: (1) {{the precision of}} the interpretation increases, and (2) its running time often falls. In abstract counting, the analysis tracks how many times an <b>abstract</b> <b>resource</b> has been allocated. A count of one implies that the <b>abstract</b> <b>resource</b> momentarily represents only one concrete resource. This knowledge, in turn, drives environment analysis, expanding the kind (rather than just the degree) of optimization available to the compiler. ...|$|R

For several sub-systems this is due to feedback mechanisms that support the current behaviour. To study future behaviour that differs materially from the current behaviour {{it will be necessary to}} look for hints in the historical behaviour of possible paths from one stable behaviour to another. It will also be necessary to examine the models in current use to see whether they are approximations valid only for the current behaviour. This leads to three important questions. 1) Do the current measurements of model input and output allow for identification of state, structure and parameters? If not then can this be remedied? 2) Do the current models have multiple stable behaviours (possibly for different parameter sets) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} is described for representing {{the level of}} resources consumed by jobs {{under the control of}} a Resource Management System, and it is shown how this measurement of resource usage can be combined with a notion of user preferences to reflect a restrictive resourceusage policy for network management. 1 Introduction Various mechanisms exist for managing contention and allotment of distributed network resources. One class of these mechanisms attempts to schedule, in the most efficient means possible, the execution of multiple, simultaneous, jobs on multiple distributed, heterogeneous, computers [1] [2] [3] [9] [10], where each job requires a determinable subset of the <b>resources.</b> <b>Abstract</b> benefit functions can be used to measure the effectiveness of resource management systems in satisfying various system and user requirements in the operation of a virtual heterogeneous network.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{structuring}} concepts for networked systems management. The concepts mainly deal with organizing and structuring management systems by introducing building blocks (called domains) and managed <b>resources</b> <b>abstract</b> representations (called shields).

Introduction Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) has been adopted by CCITT as the transport and switching technique for the Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN).

40|$|This MA {{thesis is}} a {{contemporary}} look at rural municipal {{planning and management}} in St. Lawrence and Jefferson counties, Upper New York State. The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin, since 1972, has been subject to binational agreements and federal and state legislation for the protection and development of its coastal resources. Many were enacted because state and local institutional arrangements for planning and regulating land and water uses for coastal areas were judged inadequate. A number of elements contribute to institutional complexity and affect municipal planning and management capacity. The International Joint Commission (IJC) proposes an ecosystem approach {{as part of the}} decision-making process both lake-wide and locally to address many of these concerns. The IJC is mandated by both federal governments, through the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, to investigate binational concerns throughout the basin. The present research uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess definitional clarity of the ecosystem approach and the capacity of local governments to facilitate usage of this approach in the planning and management of its coastal <b>resources.</b> (<b>Abstract</b> shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

A common breach of resource security is the class of attacks called DoS (Denial of Service) attacks. This paper proposes an architecture called TINMAN whose goal is to efficiently and effectively safeguard resource security for mobile source code written in C. We couple resource usage checks at the programming language level and at the run-time system level. This is achieved by the generation of a resource skeleton from source code. This <b>resource</b> skeleton <b>abstracts</b> the <b>resource</b> consumption behavior of the program which is validated {{by means of a}} resource usage certificate that is derived from proof generation. TIN-MAN uses resource-usage checking tools to generate proof obligations required of the resource usage certificate and provides full coverage by monitoringany essential property not guaranteed by the certificates.
