5|$|Rome {{was born}} and raised in Nesbitt, Manitoba, a small {{community}} of fewer than 30 people. He was the third of four sons born to Dennis and Karen Rome. All four brothers played hockey and made it to the minor professional level; <b>Rome</b> <b>is</b> the only one to compete in the NHL. Ashton <b>Rome</b> <b>is</b> the only other brother to be drafted into the NHL, selected 143rd overall in 2006 by the San Jose Sharks, and has played in the ECHL and AHL. Eldest brother Ryan Rome competed in the United (UHL) and Central Hockey Leagues (CHL), while Reagan Rome has played in the ECHL, AHL and in Europe.|$|E
5|$|While {{the famous}} Saint Peter's Basilica {{is located in}} Vatican City, above the {{traditional}} site of Saint Peter's tomb, the papal cathedral for the Diocese of <b>Rome</b> <b>is</b> Saint John Lateran, located within the city of Rome, though enjoying extraterritorial privileges accredited to the Holy See.|$|E
5|$|Ryse: Son of <b>Rome</b> <b>is</b> an action-adventure hack and slash {{game played}} in a third-person perspective. Players assume control of Marius Titus, a Roman general who is on a quest to avenge his murdered family. Throughout the game, players gain access to weapons {{that can be used}} to assault enemies or defend themselves. For instance, players are {{equipped}} with a sword {{that can be used to}} strike and kill enemies, and a shield that can be used to deflect enemies' attack and break their defense. The strength of each attack can be decided by players. In addition to melee-based combat, the game features spears and javelins, which serve as ranged weapons.|$|E
50|$|The Temple of Diana {{in ancient}} <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> a Roman temple which, {{according}} to the early semi-legendary history of <b>Rome,</b> <b>was</b> built in the 6th century BC {{during the reign of}} the king Servius Tullius.|$|R
60|$|The exultation of {{the victors}} was unbounded. The {{hitherto}} invincible legions of <b>Rome</b> had <b>been</b> crushed. The way to <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> clear before them. All the fatigues and hardships they had undergone were {{forgotten in the}} hour of triumph, and their native allies believed that their freedom from <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> now assured.|$|R
5|$|As a free agent, <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> {{unable to}} secure an NHL contract, and instead {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} attend the Detroit Red Wings training camp on a try-out for the 2014–15 season. At {{the completion of the}} Red Wings pre-season, <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> released and later signed to a professional try-out contract with the Norfolk Admirals of the AHL on October 22, 2014. After two games with the Admirals, <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> released from his try-out contract.|$|R
5|$|Ryse: Son of <b>Rome</b> <b>is</b> set in an {{alternate}} version of Rome. The game's tutorial section depicts Marius (voiced by John Hopkins) leading {{the defense of}} Rome against oncoming Celtic barbarians led by Boudica (Rachel McDowall). Marius hands a small, nondescript sack to a subordinate with the instructions to display it from an elevated position, then helps secure the Roman emperor, Nero (Sebastian Abineri), in a private safe room. At the emperor's behest he begins to tell his story; {{the rest of the}} game is an extended flashback depicting Marius' story up to this point.|$|E
5|$|For {{a number}} of items {{relating}} to works of art near the coast of Asia Minor and in the adjacent islands, Pliny was indebted to the general, statesman, orator and historian Gaius Licinius Mucianus, who died before 77. Pliny mentions the works of art collected by Vespasian in the Temple of Peace and in his other galleries (XXXIV:84), but much of his information about the position of such works in <b>Rome</b> <b>is</b> from books, not personal observation. The main merit of his account of ancient art, the only classical work of its kind, {{is that it is}} a compilation ultimately founded on the lost textbooks of Xenocrates and on the biographies of Duris and Antigonus.|$|E
5|$|The {{dates of}} Æthelberht's birth and {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Kent are both matters of debate. Bede, the earliest source to give dates, {{is thought to have}} drawn his information from correspondence with Albinus. Bede states that when Æthelberht died in 616 he had reigned for fifty-six years, placing his accession in 560. Bede also says that Æthelberht died twenty-one years after his baptism. Augustine’s mission from <b>Rome</b> <b>is</b> known to have arrived in 597, and according to Bede, it was this mission that converted Æthelberht. Hence Bede’s dates are inconsistent. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, an important source for early dates, is inconsistent with Bede and also has inconsistencies among different manuscript versions. Putting together the different dates in the Chronicle for birth, death, and length of reign, it appears that Æthelberht's reign was thought to have been either 560–616, or 565–618, but that the surviving sources have confused the two traditions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> {{laid out}} in 1836. The {{community}} was named after the Italian city of Rome, the founder being interested in Ancient Roman history. [...] <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> incorporated in 1838; the village incorporation was later dissolved at an unknown date.|$|R

25|$|The seven {{hills that}} {{inspired}} the name of <b>Rome</b> <b>are</b> known as Blossom, Jackson, Lumpkin, Mount Aventine, Myrtle, Old Shorter, and Neely hills. (The latter {{is also known as}} Tower or Clock Tower Hill). Some of the hills have been partially graded since <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> founded.|$|R
5|$|In 733, Bede {{travelled}} to York {{to visit}} Ecgbert, {{who was then}} bishop of York. The See of York was elevated to an archbishopric in 735, {{and it is likely}} that Bede and Ecgbert discussed the proposal for the elevation during his visit. Bede hoped to visit Ecgbert again in 734, but was too ill to make the journey. Bede also travelled to the monastery of Lindisfarne, and at some point visited the otherwise-unknown monastery of a monk named , a visit that is mentioned in a letter to that monk. Because of his widespread correspondence with others throughout the British Isles, and {{due to the fact that}} many of the letters imply that Bede had met his correspondents, it is likely that Bede travelled to some other places, although nothing further about timing or locations can be guessed. It seems certain that he did not visit Rome, however, as he would have mentioned it in the autobiographical chapter of his Historia Ecclesiastica. Nothhelm, a correspondent of Bede's who assisted him by finding documents for him in <b>Rome,</b> <b>is</b> known to have visited Bede, though the date cannot be determined beyond the fact that it was after Nothhelm's visit to Rome.|$|E

25|$|<b>Rome</b> <b>is</b> a British-American-Italian {{historical}} drama {{television series}} created by John Milius, William J. MacDonald, and Bruno Heller.

5000|$|The {{opinion of}} the Bishop of <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> always canvassed, and was often longed for. However the Bishop of <b>Rome's</b> opinion <b>was</b> by no means {{automatically}} right. For instance, the Tome of Leo of <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> highly regarded, and {{formed the basis for}} the ecumenical council's formulation. But it was not universally accepted and was even called [...] "impious" [...] and [...] "blasphemous" [...] by some. The next ecumenical council corrected a possible imbalance in Pope Leo's presentation. Although the Bishop of <b>Rome</b> <b>was</b> well respected even at this early date, the East holds that the concept of the primacy of the Roman See and Papal Infallibility were only developed much later.|$|R
