40|$|Despite the {{migration}} of people towards cities, autochthonous cheeses in Bosnia and Herzegovina survived. Technologies of these cheeses are simple and adapted to humble mountain limitations. Geographical occasions and rich mountain pastures created a certain participation of ewe's milk cheeses. Communicative isolation of hilly-mountain regions resulted in "closed" cheese production in small households. Autochthonous cheeses in Bosnia and Herzegovina have various origins. Different cheeses are produced {{in different parts of}} Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are : Travnički cheese, Masni (fat cheese), Presukača, Sirac, Livanjski cheese, Posni (lean cheese), "Suvi" (dry cheese) or "Mješinski" full fat cheese matured in sheepskin bag, fresh sour milk cheese "Kiseli" and dried sour milk cheese "Kiseli", Zajednica, Basa, Kalenderovački cheese and goat's milk cheeses (Hard and White soft goat's milk cheese), "Zarica" and Urda. Besides above-mentioned types of cheese in Bosnia and Herzegovina some other autochthonous dairy products are produced: Kajmak (Cream), Maslo (<b>Rendered</b> <b>butter)</b> and Zimsko kiselo mlijeko (Winter sour milk). The specificity in Bosnia and Herzegovina is that autochthonous dairy products are still mainly both produced and consumed in small rural households. Exceptions are Travnički cheese and Kajmak that are significantly sold at market. Only Livanjski cheese is manufactured as industry dairy product...|$|E
25|$|Most {{frequently}} {{made from}} cows' milk, butter {{can also be}} manufactured from the milk of other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, and yaks. Salt such as dairy salt, flavorings and preservatives are sometimes added to <b>butter.</b> <b>Rendering</b> <b>butter</b> produces clarified butter or ghee, which is almost entirely butterfat.|$|R
40|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characteristics of ghee produced from a direct cream method with different post-clarification heating temperatures and times were studied. Fresh cream from buffalo’s milk was inoculated with freeze dried mixed cultures of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetyllactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, and incubated at 32 ± 0. 5 °C for 4 hr. Fermented cream samples were heated to <b>render</b> <b>butter</b> oil (ghee), and post-clarification heatings were conducted at temperatures of 100 ± 5, 110 ± 5, or 120 ± 5 °C, for 5, 10, or 15 min, respectively. Free fatty acid values (FFA) and oxidative stability in hours significantly increased (P 0. 05) by post-clarification heatings. Both temperature {{and time of}} post-clarification effected changes in L, a, and b values. Values of lightness (L) ranged 100. 95 ± 0. 07 to 94. 91 ± 0. 05, yellow (b) ranged 23. 17 ± 0. 05 to 48. 32 ± 0. 07, and green (a) ranged - 6. 46 ± 0. 02 to - 7. 44 ± 0. 03, respectively...|$|R
50|$|Clarified {{butter is}} milk fat <b>rendered</b> from <b>butter</b> to {{separate}} the milk solids and water from the butterfat. Typically, it is produced by melting butter and allowing the components to separate by density. The water evaporates, some solids float {{to the surface and}} are skimmed off, and the remainder of the milk solids sink to the bottom and are left behind when the butter fat (which would then be on top) is poured off.|$|R
5|$|The {{ingredients}} include meat (either goat meat, beef or chicken); pounded wheat; ghee—(milk fat <b>rendered</b> from <b>butter,</b> {{also called}} clarified butter); milk; lentils; ginger and garlic paste; turmeric; spices such as cumin seeds, caraway seeds (shah zeera), cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, black pepper, saffron, jaggery, natural gum, allspice (kabab cheeni); and dry fruits such as pistachio, cashew, fig and almond. It is served hot {{topped with a}} ghee-based gravy, pieces of lime, chopped coriander, sliced boiled egg and fried onions as garnish.|$|R
50|$|Ragù alla bolognese is {{a complex}} sauce which {{involves}} various cooking techniques, including sweating, sautéing and braising. As such, it lends itself well to interpretation and adaptation by professional chefs and home cooks alike. Common sources of differences include which meats to use (beef, pork or veal) and their relative quantities, the possible inclusion of either cured meats or offal, which fats {{are used in the}} sauté phases (<b>rendered</b> pork fat, <b>butter,</b> olive or vegetable oil), what form of tomato is employed (fresh, canned or paste), the makeup of the cooking liquids (wine, milk, tomato juices, or broth) and their specific sequence of addition.|$|R

6000|$|From La Laguna {{we passed}} forward to Tacoronte, the 'Garden of the Guanches,' and {{inspected}} the little {{museum of the}} late D. Sebastian Casilda, collected by his father, a merchant-captain de long cours. It was a chaos of curiosities ranging from China to Peru. Amongst them, however, were four entire mummies, including one from Grand Canary. Thus we can correct M. Berthelot, who follows others in asserting that only the Guanches of Tenerife mummified their dead. The oldest description of this embalming is by a 'judicious and ingenious man who had lived twenty years in the island as a physitian and merchant.' It was inserted by Dr. Thomas Sprat in the 'Transactions of the Royal Society,' London, and was republished in John Ogilby's enormous folio [Footnote: The 'physitian' was Dr. Eden, an Englishman who visited Tenerife in 1662.--Bohn's Humboldtr, i. 66] yclept 'Africa.' The merchant 'set out from Guimar, a Town {{for the most part}} inhabited by such as derive themselves from the Antient Guanchios, in the company of some of them, to view their Caves and the corps buried in them (a favour they seldom or never permit to any, having the Corps of their Ancestors in great veneration, and likewise being extremely against any molestation of the Dead); but he had done many Eleemosynary Cures amongst them, for they are very poor (yet the poorest think themselves too good to Marry with the best Spaniard), which endeared him to them exceedingly. Otherwise it is death for any Stranger to visit these Caves and Bodies. The Corps are sew'd up in Goatskins with Thongs of the same, with very great curiosity, particularly in the incomparable exactness and evenness of the Seams; and the skins are made close and fit to the Corps, which for the most part are entire, the Eyes clos'd, Hair on their heads, Ears, Nose, Teeth, Lips, and Beards, all perfect, onely discolour'd and a little shrivell'd. He saw about three or four hundred in several Caves, some of them standing, others lying upon Beds of Wood, so hardened by an art they had (which the Spaniards call curay, to cure a piece of Wood) that no iron can pierce or hurt it.[Footnote: The same writer tells that they had earthen pots so hard that they could not be broken. I have heard of similar articles amongst the barbarous races east of Dalmatia.] These Bodies are very light, as if made of straw; and in some broken Bodies he observ'd the Nerves and Tendons, and also the String of the Veins and Arteries very distinctly. By the relation {{of one of the most}} antient of this island, they had a particular Tribe that had this art onely among themselves, and kept it as a thing sacred and not to be communicated to the Vulgar. These mixt not themselves with the rest of the Inhabitants, nor marry'd out of their own Tribe, and were also their Priests and Ministers of Religion. But when the Spaniards conquer'd the place, most of them were destroy'd and the art perisht with them, onely they held some Traditions yet of a few Ingredients that were us'd in this business; they took Butter (some say they mixed Bear's-grease with it) which they kept for that purpose in the Skins; wherein they boyl'd certain Herbs, first a kind of wild Lavender, which grows there in great quantities upon the Rocks; secondly, an Herb call'd Lara, of a very gummy and glutinous consistence, which now grows there under the tops of the Mountains; thirdly, a kind of cyclamen, or sow-bread; fourthly, wild Sage, which grows plentifully upon this island. These with others, bruised and boyl'd up into <b>Butter,</b> <b>rendered</b> it a perfect Balsom. This prepar'd, they first unbowel the Corps (and in the poorer sort, to save Charges, took out the Brain behind): after the Body was thus order'd, they had in readiness a lixivium made of the Bark of Pine-Trees, wherewith they washt the Body, drying it in the Sun in Summer and in the Winter in a Stove, repeating this very often: Afterward they began their unction both without and within, drying it as before; this they continu'd till the Balsom had penetrated into the whole Habit, and the Muscle in all parts appear'd through the contracted Skin, and the Body became exceeding light: then they sew'd them up in Goat-skins. The Antients say, that they have above twenty Caves of their Kings and great Personages with their whole Families, yet unknown to any but themselves, and which they will never discover.' Lastly, the 'physitian' declares that 'bodies are found in the caves of the Grand Canaries, in Sacks, quite consumed, and not as these in Teneriff.' ...|$|R

The aim of {{this study}} - to analyze milk fatty acid {{composition}} in determining the quantities in milk and milk products from free-range and winter period. Work tasks: to collect scientific information about the fatty acid composition in milk fat; to select and acquire sampling, preparation, fatty acid standard test methodologies; to explore the raw cow‘s milk fatty acid composition during free-range and winter differently feeding; examine the fatty acid composition in Lithuanian supermarkets marketed dairy products: <b>butter,</b> <b>rendered</b> cheese curds, fermented cheeses of summer period; to assess the saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated fatty acids and trans fatty acid isomers in the raw milk during grassland and winter period, in unpasteurised cream of winter period and in butter, chees of the summer production; to perform a statistical analysis of the data obtained; to summarize the results and compare them with the published literature of similar studies; to formulate conclusions, thesis, recommendations Preparation of test samples for analysis of fatty acids in milk, cream and milk products of the test samples prepared in accordance with the LST ISO 661 : 1989 standard. Milk fat samples of fatty acids was metilized KOH methanolic solution to prepare the methyl esters according to EN ISO 5509 - 2000 standard. Chromatographic analysis of samples was accomplished by the gas Chromatograph Shimadzu GC - 17 A, using a BPX – 70, 120 m column, according to LST EN ISO 15304 methodology. Milk and milk products fatty acid composition was determined, useing standard Supelco 37 Component FAME Mix. Winter and free-range period of the raw milk was from the Giraitė and Muniškės training base of Lithuanian Veterinary Academy. Milk samples, milk fatty acid composition was set to take two periods, when cows were fed in summer and winter diet. Unpasteurized normalized to 40 % fat cream of winter period ─ from AB „Pieno žvaigždės“; June – July, Lithuania made dairy products, selected randomly from the trade network „Maxima“. Rated fat content of milk, milk and milk products in the composition of fatty acids: saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and trans fatty acid isomers in respect; The results of the study and statistical analysis of the data processed using computer programs Microsoft Excel 2007, and ANOVA. Rezults and conclusions: 1. The cows feeding with rapeseed meal and maize during winter period affected the milk fatty acid composition: the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids increased by 19 %, reduced the amount of linoleic and linolenic acid ratio, but increased the amount of C 18 : 1 and C 18 : 2 trans isomers in milk by 28 %. 2. The amount of trans fatty acids was much lower in the milk of Free-range period than in milk of winter period (p < 0. 05) and the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids was significantly higher (p < 0001) in the milk of Free-range period. 3. Raw milk and unpasteurised cream during winter and free-range period were with well-balanced fatty acid composition. 4. Recommended in many European countries, the upper 2 % of trans fatty acids in food, the threshold was exceeded only in the butter - to 2. 1 -fold; 5. Dairy product safety of trans-fatty acids in respect of: preparation technology, raw material quality. Suggestions: 1. Recommended winter period of feeding cows to enter the diet of rapeseed and soybean meal, because it improves the milk fatty acid composition and poses no threat to exceed the threshold (in most countries) 2 % of trans fat. 2. Users are encouraged to use milk of free-range period, due to the low trans fatty acid content and the optimal ratio of omega acids. 3. To reduce the trans fatty acid content, the production of milk products to avoid long-term heat treatment. 4. Recommended the introduction of a requirement for manufacturers of food labels to specify the amount of trans fatty acid in product...|$|R
