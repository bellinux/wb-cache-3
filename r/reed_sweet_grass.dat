50|$|The {{dominant}} plant of {{the waters}} edge is reed canary grass running from the East round to the South and into the West side. Creeping bent, <b>reed</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>grass</b> and iris are abundant. Common water-crowfoot, chara species, Canadian waterweed, slender spike-rush, perfoliate pondweed and spiked water milfoil are the other main species present.|$|E
40|$|The {{results on}} the {{selected}} biometric and mechanical properties of common reed Phragmites australis and <b>reed</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>grass</b> Glyceria maxima were presented. The experiments were conducted {{with the help of}} the universal testing machine Instron 5966. The underground biomasses, diameters, tensile forces, displacements and tensile strengths for summer and winter rhizomes of both species were assessed and compared. The final results indicate that rhizomes of common reed had higher values of the studied parameters of biometric and stretching than sweet reed grass rhizomes. Therefore, there are more opportunities to use them to protect the coastline...|$|E

50|$|<b>Sweet</b> <b>grass</b> is {{also often}} present and burned in pipe-smoking {{mixtures}} alongside bearberry and red willow plants. The {{smoke from the}} pipe is said to carry the users prayers up to the creator with the rising smoke. Large medicine bags often decorated with ornate beaded designs were used by medicine men to carry sage, <b>sweet</b> <b>grass,</b> and other important plants. Blackfoot also used <b>sweet</b> <b>grass</b> smoke, or sachets of <b>sweet</b> <b>grass</b> in their clothing, as an effective insect repellent.|$|R

50|$|Sage and <b>sweet</b> <b>grass</b> {{are both}} used by Blackfoot and other Plains tribes for {{ceremonial}} purposes and are considered sacred plants. Sage and <b>sweet</b> <b>grass</b> are burned with the user inhaling and covering {{themselves in the}} smoke in a process known widely as smudging. Sage is said to rid the body of negative emotions such as anger. <b>Sweet</b> <b>grass</b> is said to draw in positive energy. Both are used for purification purposes. The pleasant and natural odor of the burning grass is said to attract spirits. <b>Sweet</b> <b>grass</b> is prepared for ceremony by braiding the stems together then drying them before burning.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the influences of <b>sweet</b> <b>grass</b> on chronic ethanol-induced oxida-tive stress in the rat brain. Chronic ethanol intoxication de-creased activities and antioxidant levels resulting in enhanced lipid peroxidation. Administration of <b>sweet</b> <b>grass</b> solution to ethanol-intoxicated rats partially normalized the activity ac-tivities of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, as well as levels of reduced glutathione and vitamins C, E, and A. <b>Sweet</b> <b>grass</b> also protected unsaturated fatty acids (arachidonic and docosahexaenoic) from oxidations and decreased levels of lipid peroxidation products: 4 -hydroxynonenal, isoprostanes, and neuroprostanes. The present in vivo study confirms pre-vious in vitro data demonstrating the bioactivity of <b>sweet</b> <b>grass</b> and suggests a possible role for <b>sweet</b> <b>grass</b> in human health protection from deleterious consequences associated with ox-idative stress formation...|$|R
