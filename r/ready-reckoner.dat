6000|$|True, all {{turns on}} your <b>Ready-Reckoner</b> being {{moderately}} correct,--being not insupportably incorrect! A <b>Ready-Reckoner</b> {{which has led}} to distinct entries in your Ledger such as these: 'Creditor an English People by fifteen hundred years of good Labour; and Debtor to lodging in enchanted Poor-Law Bastilles: Creditor by conquering the largest Empire the Sun ever saw; and Debtor to Donothingism and [...] "Impossible" [...] written on all departments of the government thereof: Creditor by mountains of gold ingots earned; and Debtor to No Bread purchasable by them:'--such <b>Ready-Reckoner,</b> methinks, is beginning to be suspect; nay is ceasing, and has ceased, to be suspect! Such <b>Ready-Reckoner</b> is a Solecism in Eastcheap; and must, whatever be the press of business, and will and shall be rectified a little. Business can go on no longer with it. The most Conservative English People, thickest-skinned, most patient of Peoples, is driven alike by its Logic and its Unlogic, by things 'spoken,' and by things not yet spoken or very speakable, but only felt and very unendurable, to be wholly a Reforming People. Their Life, as it is, has ceased to be longer possible for them.|$|E
6000|$|With all thy theoretic platitudes, what a {{depth of}} {{practical}} sense in thee, great England! A dumb people, who can do great acts, but not describe them.

6000|$|Bull is a born Conservative; {{for this}} too I inexpressibly honour him. All great Peoples are conservative; slow {{to believe in}} novelties; patient of much error in actualities; deeply and forever certain of the greatness that is in LAW, in Custom once solemnly established, and now long {{recognised}} as just and final.--True, O Radical Reformer, there is no Custom that can, properly speaking, be final; none. And yet thou seest Customs which, in all civilised countries, are accounted final; nay, under the Old-Roman name of Mores, are accounted Morality, Virtue, Laws of God Himself. Such, I assure thee, not {{a few of them}} are; such almost all of them once were. And greatly do I respect the solid character,--a blockhead, thou wilt say; yes, but a well-conditioned blockhead, and the best-conditioned,--who esteems all 'Customs once solemnly acknowledged' to be ultimate, divine, and the rule for a man to walk by, nothing doubting, not inquiring farther. What a time of it had we, were all men's life and trade still, in all parts of it, a problem, a hypothetic seeking, to be settled by painful Logics and Baconian Inductions! The Clerk in Eastcheap cannot spend the day in verifying his Ready-Reckoner; he must take it as verified, true and indisputable; or his Book-keeping by Double Entry will stand still. [...] "Where is your Posted Ledger?" [...] asks the Master at night.--"Sir," [...] answers the other, [...] "I was verifying my <b>Ready-Reckoner,</b> and find some errors. The Ledger is--!"--Fancy such a thing! ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the current versions of six major macroeconometric models, using their wage-price-exchange rate interaction as a core supply-side {{framework in which}} to interpret their properties, as revealed in standard simulation experiments. Analysis of the individual relationships reveals several deviations from this framework {{in the majority of}} the models, precluding a straightforward derivation of their long-run properties. Despite differences in their supply-side treatment the models are essential to a description of the inflationary processes in the economy and, more generally, through <b>ready-reckoners,</b> to the provision of a quantitative assessment of policy options. 1...|$|R
6000|$|The book {{itself is}} {{much longer than}} the book that I am writing; and as is only right in so {{spirited}} an apologist, every paragraph is provocative. I could write an essay on every sentence which I accept and three essays on every sentence which I deny. Bernard Shaw himself {{is a master of}} compression; he can put a conception more compactly than any other man alive. It is therefore rather difficult to compress his compression; one feels as if one were trying to extract a beef essence from Bovril. But the shortest form in which I can state the idea of The Quintessence of Ibsenism is that it is the idea of distrusting ideals, which are universal, in comparison with facts, which are miscellaneous. The man whom he attacks throughout he calls [...] "The Idealist"; that is the man who permits himself to be mainly moved by a moral generalisation. [...] "Actions," [...] he says, [...] "are to be judged by their effect on happiness, and not by their conformity to any ideal." [...] As we have already seen, there is a certain inconsistency here; for while Shaw had always chucked all ideals overboard the one he had chucked first was the ideal of happiness. Passing this however for the present, we may mark the above as the most satisfying summary. If I tell a lie I am not to blame myself for having violated the ideal of truth, but only for having perhaps got myself into a mess and made things worse than they were before. If I have broken my word I need not feel (as my fathers did) that I have broken something inside of me, as one who breaks a blood vessel. It all depends on whether I have broken up something outside me; as one who breaks up an evening party. If I shoot my father the only question is whether I have made him happy. I must not admit the idealistic conception that the mere shooting of my father might possibly make me unhappy. We are to judge of every individual case as it arises, apparently without any social summary or moral <b>ready-reckoner</b> at all. [...] "The Golden Rule {{is that there is no}} Golden Rule." [...] We must not say that it is right to keep promises, but that it may be right to keep this promise. Essentially it is anarchy; nor is it very easy to see how a state could be very comfortable which was Socialist in all its public morality and Anarchist in all its private. But if it is anarchy, it is anarchy without any of the abandon and exuberance of anarchy. It is a worried and conscientious anarchy; an anarchy of painful delicacy and even caution. For it refuses to trust in traditional experiments or plainly trodden tracks; every case must be considered anew from the beginning, and yet considered with the most wide-eyed care for human welfare; every man must act as if he were the first man made. Briefly, we must always be worrying about what is best for our children, and we must not take one hint or rule of thumb from our fathers. Some think that this anarchism would make a man tread down mighty cities in his madness. I think it would make a man walk down the street as if he were walking on egg-shells. I do not think this experiment in opportunism would end in frantic license; I think it would end in frozen timidity. If a man was forbidden to solve moral problems by moral science or the help of mankind, his course would be quite easy--he would not solve the problems. The world instead of being a knot so tangled as to need unravelling, would simply become a piece of clockwork too complicated to be touched. I cannot think that this untutored worry was what Ibsen meant; I have my doubts as to whether it was what Shaw meant; but I do not think that it can be substantially doubted that it was what he said.|$|E
5000|$|The panjika (a.k.a. paanji) is the Hindu astronomical almanac, {{published}} in Odia, Maithili, Assamese and Bengali. In colloquial language {{it is called}} a 'panji'. In other parts of India it is called a panchangam. It is amongst the most popular annual books {{published in}} India and is a handy reference for observant Hindus to determine the most auspicious times for their rituals, festivals, celebrations, and pursuits of various sorts including marriage, undertaking travels, etc. It is somewhat a <b>ready-reckoner,</b> or the first source, before one approaches a priest or an astrologer {{to decide on the}} details. Even [...] "non-believers" [...] amongst Hindus and those who are not Hindus often consult a panjika for much of the practical information it publishes. It also records Muslim, Christian and other festivals, dates of birth and death of many leading personalities and carries informative articles on astrology.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} determine the integral fringe order associated with a fractional fringe value that is measured using Tardy or other similar compensators. The method makes use of two different wavelengths of light to determine the fractional fringe values. Further, it does not assume {{the independence of the}} material fringe constant on the wavelength of light used. From these measured fractional fringe values, the associated integral fringe order is determined. A method to construct a <b>ready-reckoner</b> table is also described which helps to identify the integral fringe order from any two measured fractional fringe values. ...|$|E
40|$|In December 1993, the Macalister Research Farm began a whole-farm {{study to}} compare the {{benefits}} and costs of two systems of dairy farming, based on two different stocking rates. The farm, comprising 80 ha of irrigated perennial pasture, was split into two similar sub-farms. The herd of 250 cows was split into two sub-herds of similar average age and productive capacity. One herd was stocked at 2. 6 cows/ha, the other at 3. 9 cows/ha. Over the next 2 ‰ years, both herds were managed to achieve similar levels of milk production per cow {{and high levels of}} pasture utilisation. Records were kept of all inputs and outputs associated with the operation of each sub-farm. In each season, the higher stocked herd produced more milk per hectare and slightly more per cow, required higher levels of supplementary feeding and other operational inputs, and yielded higher profits than the lower stocked herd. Individual farmers have to decide whether the higher profits of the higher stocked system were sufficient to justify the extra labour and stress involved in operating the larger herd. The difference in profitability between the two systems was very sensitive to changes in the price of milk, and costs of grain and nitrogen fertiliser. The results of this study have been used to develop a <b>ready-reckoner</b> for use by farmers considering variations in stocking rate for their own farms...|$|E
