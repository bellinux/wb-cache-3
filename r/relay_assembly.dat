One interpretation, mainly due to Elton Mayo, was that [...] "the six individuals became a team and the team gave itself wholeheartedly and spontaneously to cooperation in the experiment."

40|$|The "Hawthorne Effect" {{has been}} the most {{enduring}} legacy of the celebrated studies of workplace behaviour conducted in the 1920 's and the 1930 's at the Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric company. Paradoxically, {{it is not clear that}} this effect constituted more than an incidental and intermediate finding for the original researchers. This paper examines the empirical evidence for Hawthorne effects using the original data from the Hawthorne <b>Relay</b> <b>Assembly</b> Test Room, where a group of workers was closely studied, with a variety of experimental and other changes in th work environment, over a period of more than 5 years. Using both narrow and broad definitions of an experimental change and allowing for other factors and for potential interdependance of the owrkers' output levels, I assess whether such experimental changes had a common effect that could be regarded as a pure result of the experimentation. The main conclusion is that there is only a slender evidence of a Hawthorne effect in the Hawthorne <b>Relay</b> <b>Assembly</b> Test Room. ...|$|E

In {{order to}} balance between {{optimality}} and operation efficiency of relay selection algorithm, an efficient relay selection algorithm {{has been raised}} based on bit error rate (BER) in an amplify-and-forward (AF) collaborated relay network. The algorithm, based on characters of channel statistical information and system BER, adds gain parameter of equivalent channel, sets SNR as threshold, select <b>relay</b> node <b>assembly</b> in the condition of same power, so as to minimize system BER. This algorithm has equal performance with Full Search Algorithm but with simpler calculation. Performance of the relay selection calculation BER is better than other algorithm by forwarding and preselecting an optimal relay node. I...|$|R
40|$|A compact, acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) imaging spectropolarimeter {{for ground}} based {{astronomy}} from 400 - 1100 nm has been constructed at NASA/GSFC. The {{key components of}} this instrument are a TeO 2 non-collinear AOTF, CCD camera, and an all-reflective optical <b>relay</b> <b>assembly</b> which uses a single elliptical mirror to produce side-by-side orthogonally polarized spectral images. The instrument was used at the Lowell Observatory 42 -inch telescope for 'first light' planetary imaging and measurements of photometric standard stars. Narrow-band images of Saturn near 700 nm appear to show polarization effects which result from multiple scattering by aerosols. The instrument has recently been upgraded in order to integrate the RF drive electronics and eliminate contamination by scattered light. Design of the instrument and some initial results are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{historical}} productivity {{data from}} the Hawthorne experiments per-mit the statistical evaluation of the hypotheses of the original experimenters and others by conducting appropriate time-series analyses. In this paper a recent hypothesis by H. M. Parsons that the output trends in the first <b>relay</b> <b>assembly</b> test room experiment were due primarily to increased skill and com-petence is evaluated empirically by fitting a standard learning equation to the data for each operator. The learning equation describes the overall data trends very well. Then, to assess {{the effects of the}} experimental manipulations and variables hypothesized by other investigators, the productivity data are de-trended of the learning effect and the detrended data are analyzed. This analy-sis shows that the introduction of rest pauses in the test room led to the more productive use of work time. Overall, it appears that the conditions motivating increased learning—i. e., improved reinforcement conditions (in-creased status and new economic incentives) and regular performance feedback —were the primary causes of increased output. Because the mysterious findings of long-term overall increases in worker productivity stimulated widespread theorizing, research, and debate, the Hawthorne First <b>Relay</b> <b>Assembly</b> Test Room experiment has had far-reaching and continuing effects on management theory and policy. The many explanations, reanalyses and subsequent critiques of the Hawthorne research have extended the debate between contending management phi-losophies and in particular between the Human Relations (Mayo, a, b) and Scientific Management (Taylor) approaches. During the early years most of the debate was based solely on ideological grounds (cf. Argyle; Lands-berger). Later analyses (cf. Blumberg; Carey) marshalled substantive evi-*Appreciation is expressed to my colleagues, Robert L. Hamblin and Bradley W.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development process}} and results of a battery system model with a fault simulation for electric propulsion vehicles. The developed battery system model {{can be used to}} verify control and fault diagnosis strategies of the supervisory controller in an electric propulsion vehicle. To develop this battery system model, three sub-models, including a battery model, a <b>relay</b> <b>assembly</b> model, and a battery management system (BMS) model, are connected together like in the target real battery system. Comparison results between the real battery system hardware and the battery system model show a similar tendency and values. Furthermore, the fault injection test of the model shows that the proposed battery system model can simulate a failure situation consistent with a real system. It is possible for the model to emulate the battery characteristics and fault situation if it is used in the development process of a BMS or for supervisory control strategies for electric propulsion systems...|$|E
50|$|The {{centrally}} positioned eyepiece {{is for the}} viewfinder. An external mechanism, {{hidden inside}} the protrusion at the left-hand side of the lens/shutter <b>assembly,</b> <b>relays</b> the front lens element extension to the rangefinder optics by sensing {{the height of a}} milled cam at the periphery of the lens barrel just behind the toothed rim. Both the separate viewfinder and rangefinder eyepieces and the lens coupling are {{in the style of the}} Leica camera. The difference is the way in which the lever operates on the lens barrel. Looking through the small rangefinder window at the left-hand side at the back reveals a clear view of a horizontally split image. The lower image part is shifted sideways by turning the focusing wheel at the front right-hand side of the lens. By aligning the vertical feature of any object in the motive that crosses the split in the rangefinder image may render it sharp on the film.|$|R
40|$|In Ghana, the {{agricultural}} sector {{in general and the}} tomato sector in particular have not met their potential. In the tomato sector, production seasonality, the dominance of rainfed agriculture, high perishability of the fruits combined with no storage facilities, and poor market access, have resulted in low average yields but seasonal gluts with some farmers unable to sell their tomatoes which are consequently left to rot in their fields. The tomato value chain in Ghana is characterised by a “two level” system in which itinerant traders—the market queens —are the direct link between rural farm producers and urban consumption, rather than by a set of assembly markets which bulk the produce before being sold to urban wholesalers at <b>relay</b> markets. <b>Assembly</b> markets enable inspection, grading, and better price transmission, but the time taken to get the crop from farmgate to consumer is relatively long. The two-level trader system reduces delays of passing through assembly markets, allowing rapid movement of the produce from producer to consumer, important for highly perishable agricultural products such as tomato, but fragments price signals resulting in poor spatial price adjustments (Bell et al. 1999; Orchard and Suglo 1999). In a two level system, farmers are distanced from market signals: most wait for the market queens to come to their fields and if these traders do not come, farmers leave the tomatoes to rot in the field {{in the absence of a}} local market. Traders allocate a certain number of crates, which determines how much farmers can sell on that particular day and there is little if any room for price-quantity or price-quality negotiations. Signals from consumers with respect to quality, price, and quantities demanded, are not transmitted back along the value chain to the farmers. Though packers may remove the poorest quality fruits, tomatoes of different qualities and even different varieties are not graded but rather simply piled them into over-sized crates.

40|$|Amyloid is {{associated}} with both pathological protein deposits {{and the formation of}} functional protein structures. Therefore, several strategies have evolved to control the formation or inhibition of amyloid in vivo. In this thesis, three separate systems were investigated in which amyloidogenic protein segments are coupled to regulatory elements that prevent or promote fibrillation. We describe the molecular mechanism for how (a) a propeptide segment prevents the uncontrolled aggregation of the mature peptide, (b) a chaperone domain inhibits amyloid formation, and (c) a pH-dependent <b>relay</b> controls protein <b>assembly.</b> For this purpose, mass spectrometry (MS) -based approaches to structural biology were applied and extended, involving gas phase interaction studies and hydrogen/deuterium exchange MS. (a) Proinsulin C-peptide is beneficial for the preservation of insulin activity. We show that C-peptide interferes with insulin amyloid fibril formation at low pH and how conserved glutamate residues in C-peptide mediate reversible co-precipitation with insulin. A mechanism is proposed for how the balance between zinc and C-peptide mediates sorting of insulin into slow acting and rapid acting forms inside the secretory granules of the pancreatic -cells, which potentially links C-peptide to diabetes type 1 and 2. (b) Lung surfactant protein C (SP-C) is a highly amyloidogenic transmembrane polypeptide that controls surface tension in the alveolar phospholipid bilayer. Its proprotein includes a conserved chaperone domain termed BRICHOS, which is also associated with neurodegenerative disorders. It is shown here how BRICHOS and its N-terminal linker recognize hydrophobic residues and trap the SP-C segment in a - hairpin conformation to prevent amyloid formation. (c) Spider silk is synthesized as a highly soluble protein that assembles into silk in a pH-dependent fashion. It is shown that the spider silk protein N-terminal (NT) domain dimerizes at the same pH interval that triggers silk assembly, and we define the associated structural changes. Furthermore, the use of the NT domain as a solubility tag for the expression of aggregation-prone proteins is demonstrated. In summary, we have determined the molecular basis for three distinct mechanisms by which fibril formation is controlled through autoregulatory elements and provide insights into nature’s strategies to control amyloid formation and prevention. Based on these findings, we can now make conclusions about nature’s handling of amyloidogenic proteins and their function in general...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} basic task in any robotic assembly line where industry tend to ignore is the {{pick and place}} operation. Generally, the pick and place operation consists of guiding the robot s arm or manipulators to the targets position, picking up or releasing objects and moving the objects to new target locations using a specially designed or off the shelve grippers. Grippers are end-effectors used to grasp and hold objects for a particular assigned task. Despite the fact that robotic grippers' studies are a mature subject, yet {{it is still a}} rewarding area for research development, especially to the manufacturing industry. This paper describes {{the development of a new}} gripper for the pick and place of a <b>relay</b> <b>assembly</b> line in an electronics manufacturing company. The research findings are based on case study conducted at the local electronic company. The present assembly operation in one of the station of the identified electronic parts is still done manually. CAD/CAM software was exploited extensively to model a geometrical design of the robot gripper. The gripper s performance was examined by studying the gripper force and control analysis. With the analytical study of the gripper parameters required to meet the design specifications of the product, a prototype of the robot gripper was fabricated. Financial and production analysis in terms of cost comparison before and after the implementation of the new pick and place set-up was also carried out to examine the viability of the project. The final results shown that it can have a significantly increased in productivity, revenue and profit to the company if it is to be implemented at the plant. Implementation of this will also creates flexibility in the assembly line setup for further development to a fully automated relay production line...|$|E
