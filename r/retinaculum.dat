5|$|In all {{butterflies}} (with {{the exception}} of male Euschemoninae) and in Bombycoidea moths (with {{the exception of}} the Sphingidae), there is no arrangement of frenulum and <b>retinaculum</b> to couple the wings. Instead, an enlarged humeral area of the hindwing is broadly overlapped by the forewing. Despite the absence of a specific mechanical connection, the wings overlap and operate in phase. The power stroke of the forewing pushes down the hindwing in unison. This type of coupling is a variation of frenate type but where the frenulum and <b>retinaculum</b> are completely lost.|$|E
5|$|The more {{primitive}} groups have an enlarged lobe-like {{area near the}} basal posterior margin (i.e. {{at the base of}} the forewing) called a jugum, that folds under the hindwing during flight. Other groups have a frenulum on the hindwing that hooks under a <b>retinaculum</b> on the forewing.|$|E
25|$|Other {{groups have}} a {{frenulum}} on the hindwing that hooks under a <b>retinaculum</b> on the forewing.|$|E
25|$|The {{abductor}} pollicis brevis (APB) originates on the scaphoid tubercle and the flexor <b>retinaculum.</b> It inserts to the radial {{sesamoid bone}} and the proximal phalanx of the thumb. It is innervated by the median nerve (C8-T1).|$|E
25|$|The opponens pollicis {{originates}} on the tubercle of the trapezium and the flexor <b>retinaculum.</b> It {{is inserted}} onto the radial {{side of the}} first metacarpal. It opposes the thumb and assists in adduction. It is innervated by the median nerve.|$|E
25|$|Most {{species have}} an abdominal, tail-like appendage, the furcula, that is folded beneath {{the body to}} be used for jumping when the animal is threatened. It is held under tension by a small {{structure}} called the <b>retinaculum</b> (or tenaculum) and when released, snaps against the substrate, flinging the springtail into the air. All of this takes place in as little as 18milliseconds.|$|E
25|$|In {{general for}} Key Pinch the thumb {{has to be}} activated. In the lower groups {{according}} to the International Classification (IC groups 0–1) this can only be done by means of tenodesis. In IC groups 2 and higher the m. brachioradialis is used to strengthen the thumb flexor. Usually the thumb extensor is fixed to the extensor <b>retinaculum</b> and the CMC1 joint is arthrodesed/fused in the right position.|$|E
25|$|The flexor pollicis brevis (FPB) has two heads. The {{superficial}} head arises on the flexor <b>retinaculum,</b> {{while the}} deep head originates on three carpal bones: the trapezium, trapezoid, and capitate. The muscle is inserted onto the radial sesamoid bone of the metacarpophalangeal joint. It acts to flex, adduct, and abduct the thumb, {{and is therefore}} also able to oppose the thumb. The superficial head is innervated by the median nerve, while the deep head is innervated by the ulnar nerve (C8-T1).|$|E
25|$|In some species, {{differences}} in form {{between the sexes}} is quite marked. For example, in the African species Agrius convolvuli (the convolvulus or morning glory hawk moth), the antennae are thicker and wing markings more mottled in the male than in the female. Only males have both an undivided frenular hook and a <b>retinaculum.</b> Also, all male hawk moths have a partial comb of hairs along their antennae. Females call males to them with pheromones. The male may douse the female with a pheromone before mating.|$|E
500|$|Hepialidae have short, {{pectinate}} antennae and, unusually primitive for Lepidoptera, lack {{a functional}} proboscis or <b>retinaculum</b> {{and are therefore}} non-feeding. [...] The moths possess several other morphological features that are considered phylogenetically primitive. [...] The gap between the fore- and hindwing is distinct and the wings are covered in scale-like hairs. [...] At {{the base of the}} forewing is a jugum, a small lobe that joins the fore- and hindwings during flight. [...] In females, the configuration of the genitalia is exoporian, typified by an external groove along which spermatophores are transferred after mating, from the copulatory opening (the ostium bursae), to the ovipore for fertilisation.|$|E
500|$|In many insect species, the forewing and hindwing are coupled together, which {{improves}} the aerodynamic efficiency of flight. The most common coupling mechanism (e.g., Hymenoptera and Trichoptera) is {{a row of}} small hooks on the forward margin of the hindwing, or [...] "hamuli", which lock onto the forewing, keeping them held together (hamulate coupling). In some other insect species (e.g., Mecoptera, Lepidoptera, and some Trichoptera) the jugal lobe of the forewing covers {{a portion of the}} hindwing (jugal coupling), or the margins of the forewing and hindwing overlap broadly (amplexiform coupling), or the hindwing bristles, or frenulum, hook under the retaining structure or <b>retinaculum</b> on the forewing.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{butterflies}} (except the male of one species of hesperiid) {{and in the}} Bombycoidea (except the Sphingidae), there is no arrangement of frenulum and <b>retinaculum</b> to couple the wings. Instead, an enlarged [...] humeral area of the hindwing is broadly overlapped by the forewing. Despite {{the absence of a}} specific mechanical connection, the wings overlap and operate in phase. The power stroke of the forewing pushes down the hindwing in unison. This type of coupling is a variation of frenate type but where the frenulum and <b>retinaculum</b> are completely lost.|$|E
2500|$|Ulnar {{collateral}} ligament (UCL): An extracapsular ligament, the UCL {{is located}} ulnarly to the AOL. [...] It has its origin on the flexor <b>retinaculum</b> and is inserted on the ulnopalmar tubercle {{of the first}} metacarpal. [...] It is taut in abduction, extension, and pronation, and often found elongated in connection to CMC joint arthritis. [...] The importance ascribed to the UCL varies considerably among researchers.|$|E
2500|$|Tinel's sign is {{a classic}} test to detect median nerve irritation. Tinel's sign is {{performed}} by lightly tapping the skin over the flexor <b>retinaculum</b> to elicit a sensation of tingling or [...] "pins and needles" [...] in the median nerve distribution. Tinel's sign (pain and/or paresthesias of the median-innervated fingers with percussion over the median nerve), depending on the study, has 38–100% sensitivity and 55–100% specificity for the diagnosis of CTS.|$|E
2500|$|The eggs of hedylid moths have {{an upright}} {{configuration}} and are variable in shape: in Macrosoma inermis they are particularly narrow and spindle-shaped resembling those of some Pieridae {{and in the}} case of M. tipulata they are more barrel-shaped, like certain Nymphalidae. The larvae resemble probably convergently those of Apaturinae. Adult hedylids resemble geometer moths. They share many morphological and genetic characteristics both with the superfamilies Papilionoidea and Hesperioidea. The abdomen is very long and slim, like many Neotropical butterflies of the subfamilies Ithomiinae and Heliconiinae, hence the name of one Macrosoma species [...] "heliconiaria". Unlike other butterflies however, the antennae are un-clubbed, but rather filiform or bipectinate. Unlike the family Geometridae, in which they had been placed by the geometer expert L.B.Prout, hedylids lack tympanic organs at the base of the abdomen, but have them on the wings (see under Behaviour). Unlike other butterflies, however, (except in the unique case of the remarkable Australian skipper butterfly Euschemon rafflesia whose males possess these structures), the single-spined frenulum, and <b>retinaculum</b> is not lost or reduced in males, except in three Macrosoma species where there is no functional wing coupling system; the <b>retinaculum</b> is always lost in females and the frenulum may be vestigial. The family have been fully catalogued and illustrated in an identification guide.|$|E
2500|$|The {{carpal tunnel}} is an {{anatomical}} compartment {{located at the}} base of the palm. Nine flexor tendons and the median nerve pass through the carpal tunnel that is surrounded on three sides by the carpal bones that form an arch. The median nerve provides feeling or sensation to the thumb, index finger, long finger, and half of the ring finger. At the level of the wrist, the median nerve supplies the muscles {{at the base of}} the thumb that allow it to abduct, move away from the other four fingers, as well as move out of the plane of the palm. The carpal tunnel is located at the middle third of the base of the palm, bounded by the bony prominence of the scaphoid tubercle and trapezium {{at the base of the}} thumb, and the hamate hook that can be palpated along the axis of the ring finger. From the anatomical position, the carpal tunnel is bordered on the anterior surface by the transverse carpal ligament, also known as the flexor <b>retinaculum.</b> The flexor <b>retinaculum</b> is a strong, fibrous band that attaches to the pisiform and the hamulus of the hamate. The proximal boundary is the distal wrist skin crease, and the distal boundary is approximated by a line known as Kaplan's cardinal line. [...] This line uses surface landmarks, and is drawn between the apex of the skin fold between the thumb and index finger to the palpated hamate hook.|$|E
2500|$|Antennae are {{generally}} not very feathery, even in the males. They lack tympanal organs, but {{members of the group}} Choerocampini have hearing organs on their heads. They have a frenulum and <b>retinaculum</b> to join hind wings and fore wings. [...] The thorax, abdomen, and wings are densely covered in scales. Some sphingids have a rudimental proboscis, but most have a very long one, which is used to feed on nectar from flowers. Most are crepuscular or nocturnal, but some species fly during the day. Both males and females are relatively long-lived (living 10 to 30 days). Prior to flight, most species shiver their flight muscles to warm them up, and, during flight, body temperatures may surpass [...]|$|E
2500|$|In {{the deep}} layer, the tibialis {{posterior}} has its origin on the interosseus membrane and the neighbouring bone areas and runs {{down behind the}} medial malleolus. Under the foot it splits into a thick medial part attached to the navicular bone and a slightly weaker lateral part inserted to the three cuneiform bones. The muscle produces simultaneous plantar flexion and supination in the non-weight-bearing leg, and approximates the heel to the calf of the leg. The flexor hallucis longus arises distally on the fibula and on the interosseus membrane from where its relatively thick muscle belly extends far distally. Its tendon extends beneath the flexor <b>retinaculum</b> to the {{sole of the foot}} and finally attaches on the base of the last phalanx of the hallux. It plantarflexes the hallux and assists in supination. The flexor digitorum longus, finally, has its origin on {{the upper part of the}} tibia. Its tendon runs to the sole of the foot where it forks into four terminal tendon attached to the last phalanges of the four lateral toes. It crosses the tendon of the tibialis posterior distally on the tibia, and the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus in the sole. Distally to its division, the quadratus plantae radiates into it and near the middle phalanges its tendons penetrate the tendons of the flexor digitorum brevis. In the non-weight-bearing leg, it plantar flexes the toes and foot and supinates. In the weight-bearing leg it supports the plantar arch. (For the popliteus, see above.) ...|$|E
50|$|The palmar carpal {{ligament}} is {{a different}} structure than the flexor <b>retinaculum</b> of the hand, but the two are frequently confused. The palmar carpal ligament lies superficial and proximal to the flexor <b>retinaculum.</b> The ulnar nerve and the ulnar artery run through the ulnar canal, which is deep to the palmar carpal ligament and superficial to the flexor <b>retinaculum.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{superior}} extensor <b>retinaculum</b> of {{the foot}} (transverse crural ligament) is {{the upper part of}} the extensor <b>retinaculum</b> of foot which extends from the ankle to the heelbone.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{conducted}} on the <b>retinaculum</b> have exhibited it to have several possible surgical treatments uses. A graft of the extensor <b>retinaculum</b> was shown to be useful in treating boxer's knuckle when direct repair of the damaged capsule is not possible. Because of their similarities in histological structure, studies also show the extensor <b>retinaculum</b> to be a reasonable biological replacement for reconstruction of a deficient annular pulley.|$|E
5000|$|In these surgeries, the flexor <b>retinaculum</b> {{is either}} simply severed or lengthened. When surgery {{is done to}} divide the flexor <b>retinaculum</b> (which {{is by far the}} more common procedure), scar tissue will {{eventually}} fill the gap left by surgery. The intent is that this will lengthen the flexor <b>retinaculum</b> enough to accommodate inflamed or damaged tendons and reduce the effects of compression on the median nerve ...|$|E
5000|$|The peroneal retinacula (singular: peroneal <b>retinaculum)</b> are fibrous {{retaining}} bands which bind {{down the}} tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis as they {{run across the}} side of the ankle. (<b>Retinaculum</b> is Latin for retainer).|$|E
50|$|The flexor <b>retinaculum</b> is {{continuous}} {{with the}} palmar carpal ligament, and deeper with the palmar aponeurosis. The ulnar artery and ulnar nerve, and the cutaneous {{branches of the}} median and ulnar nerves, pass {{on top of the}} flexor <b>retinaculum.</b> On the radial side of the <b>retinaculum</b> is the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis, which lies in the groove on the greater multangular between the attachments of the ligament to the bone.|$|E
5000|$|Capsular or {{extensor}} <b>retinaculum</b> plication. This {{surgical technique}} aims to improve DRUJ stability by shortening the joint capsule or the extensor <b>retinaculum.</b> It is mostly used for minor DRUJ instability and is less invasive {{compared to a}} complete RUL reconstruction.|$|E
50|$|The tendon, {{after passing}} under the {{superior}} extensor <b>retinaculum</b> of foot and inferior extensor <b>retinaculum</b> of {{foot in the}} same canal as the extensor digitorum longus, is inserted into the dorsal surface of {{the base of the}} metatarsal bone of the fifth digit.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Inferior {{extensor}} <b>retinaculum</b> of foot.Deep dissection.|$|E
50|$|It {{ends in a}} slender, {{flattened}} tendon, which {{passes over}} {{the upper part of}} the flexor <b>retinaculum</b> and inserts onto the central part of the flexor <b>retinaculum</b> and lower part of the palmar aponeurosis. Frequently, it sends a tendinous slip to the short muscles of the thumb.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>retinaculum</b> (plural retinacula) is a band around tendons {{that holds}} them in place. It {{is not part}} of any muscle. Its {{function}} is mostly to stabilize a tendon. The term <b>retinaculum</b> is New Latin, derived from the Latin verb retinere (to retain). Specific retinacula include: ...|$|E
5000|$|Tight {{anatomical}} structures, e.g. <b>retinaculum</b> or iliotibial band.|$|E
50|$|The lateral <b>retinaculum</b> is the fibrous tissue on {{the lateral}} (outer) {{side of the}} kneecap (patella). The kneecap has both a medial (on the inner aspect) and a lateral (on the outer side) <b>retinaculum,</b> and these help to support the kneecap in its {{position}} {{in relation to the}} femur bone underneath it.|$|E
50|$|Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} may be treated surgically; {{although this is}} usually done after all non-surgical methods of treatment have been exhausted. Non-surgical treatment methods include aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs. Additionally, the wrist may also be immobilized {{in order to prevent}} further use and inflammation. When surgery is needed, the flexor <b>retinaculum</b> is either completely severed or lengthened. When surgery is done to divide the flexor <b>retinaculum,</b> by far the more common procedure, scar tissue will eventually fill the gap left by surgery. The intent is that this will lengthen the flexor <b>retinaculum</b> enough to accommodate inflamed or damaged tendons and reduce the effects of compression on the median nerve. In a 2004 double blind-study, researchers concluded that there was no perceivable benefit gained from lengthening the flexor <b>retinaculum</b> during surgery and so division of the ligament remains the preferred method of surgery.|$|E

50|$|Other {{groups of}} moth have a {{frenulum}} on the hindwing that hooks under a <b>retinaculum</b> on the forewing. The <b>retinaculum</b> is a hook or tuft {{on the underside}} of the forewing of some moths.
