500|$|Other reviews {{were also}} positive; Sal Cinquemani form Slant Magazine {{suggested}} that [...] "The Fear" [...] is {{proof of the}} pop singer's self-awareness, but, given her own personal tabloid history, the song possesses a trail of irony: [...] "I'll look at The Sun and I'll look in The Mirror/I'm on the right track, yeah, we're onto a winner." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly liked the song, in which Allen makes fun of her own material-girl ID {{and went on to}} say that it is in fact [...] "a tale of two Lilys: the naughty postadolescent in the <b>rearview</b> mirror, and the fully realized female coming around the bend." [...] Chris Buckle from The Skinny gave [...] "The Fear" [...] three stars, commenting that it [...] "is a potent reminder that she's more than just gobby gossip-fodder", but also disliked a few lyrics, which [...] "in particular [...] a clumsy attempt to inject politics amongst the celeb-woe naval-gazing", while About.com praised the song for being a [...] "pop masterpiece", Allen's [...] "witty intelligent lyrics" [...] and compared it to Pink's [...] "Stupid Girls".|$|E

[...] Dirk Vandenberg, the band's [...] "buddy/contributor," [...] took photos from the backseat as Watt drove under the sign to San Pedro; it took three circuits of the highway and two days of photography before Minutemen were happy with the cover. Vandenberg later commented on the cover art: [...] "There were three elements that Mike [...] wanted in the photo: a natural kind of glint in his eyes reflected in the <b>rearview</b> mirror, the speedometer pinned exactly at 55mph, and, of course, the San Pedro sign guiding us home". However, when the cover was presented to SST, [...] "someone botched the cropping for the print and cut off the end of the word Pedro." ...|$|E

[...] Coyne suggested a duet with Justin Timberlake, but Hillenburg refused, saying [...] "I don't want any of those sort of commercial weirdos on there. I don't like those commercial people.
