[...] Into the 20th century leatherworkers polished leather, parchment, and hides, by tying the skins to a frame using a ball at each corner of the hide then <b>rubbing</b> <b>down</b> material being worked with stones.

[...] This caused the balls to grow in size until the process had to be started over by replacing the oversized balls with scraps and beginning a new ball.|$|E
