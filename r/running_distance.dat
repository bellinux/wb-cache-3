2500|$|Ground {{squirrels}} {{are generally}} quite social animals and some species even live in cohesive colonies. All ground squirrels live in burrows, which in species like prairie dogs {{can be quite}} elaborate. The “contour flight with short glide attack” is essentially the only hunting technique used by golden eagles on ground squirrels. Ground squirrels usually forage within <b>running</b> <b>distance</b> {{of one of their}} burrow entrances, so it is essential for the golden eagle to have a surprise factor. Eagles will not enter burrows, unlike some mammalian carnivores that eat ground squirrels. When they hunt ground squirrels, golden eagles seem to choose their victim in the last few seconds before they strike. Most of the ground squirrels targeted by the eagles are quite small, with the entire Spermophilus group and some prairie dogs weighing under [...] Marmots are a more formidable catch since most species weigh at least [...] in spring and about twice that by fall, which is roughly the highest weight feasible for a flying eagle to carry. Although they may locally target large numbers of juveniles, in other cases they may dismember an adult marmot after a kill so they are able to carry it to the nest. In the Alps, it is believed to be advantageous for eagles to nest below the meadows that host their Alpine marmot prey so they can fly downhill, a much easier flying method while carrying a heavy load than flying uphill.|$|E

Seeing which, Daun also immediately withdrew, through the gorges of the Mountains again. And for seven weeks thenceforth sat contemplative, without the least farther attempt at relief of Schweidnitz. It was during those seven weeks, some time after this, that poor Madam Daun, going to a Levee at Schonbrunn one day, had her carriage half filled with symbolical nightcaps, successively flung in upon her by the Vienna people;--symbolical; in lieu of Slashing Articles, and Newspapers the best Instructors, which they as yet have not.|$|E

30|$|Sex {{differences}} in running performance {{have been shown}} to vary by race’s distance. For instance, Cheuvront et al.

40|$|Long <b>distance</b> <b>running</b> {{has become}} {{increasingly}} popular in Hong Kong and some middle-aged men take up running in midlife. This research studies the transformative learning that occurs when they practise long <b>distance</b> <b>running</b> in midlife and how it contributes to midlife transition. At {{the beginning of the}} study, four hypotheses were developed based on researcher’s observations and literature review. Thirteen middle-aged Hong Kong male runners were then interviewed in a semi-structured way. Thirty-four themes were identified from the data and analysed. The hypotheses were evaluated and arguments of this thesis were then developed. It is then found that long <b>distance</b> <b>running</b> mirrors some real life situations of middle-aged men, triggers transformative learning, and provides the setting for them to reflect on and practise the transformed beliefs and values. When running and the associated transformation address the initial concerns of the middle-aged men, and they are able to resolve difficulties in running with proper methods and find ways to enjoy <b>running,</b> long <b>distance</b> <b>running</b> becomes part of their lives. Long <b>distance</b> <b>running</b> is then a high leverage activity which addresses other midlife concerns and contributes to other life aspects and midlife transition. Moreover, those who were good at sports as teenagers and did not exercise regularly in mid-adulthood are found to benefit more easily from taking up long <b>distance</b> <b>running</b> in midlife. This study extends the application of transformative learning theory to understand and facilitate midlife transition and shows that a single routine activity, like long <b>distance</b> <b>running,</b> can be a multi-function activity in the transformative learning process and a high leverage activity for midlife transition that contributes to multiple life aspects...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of {{comfortable}} self-paced running (CSPR) for two different distances (900 m and 2, 000 m) on mood state, and to assess exercise intensity during exercise. Sixty-eight male and 106 female students, who took a sport psychology or health science class, were asked to perform a trial of CSPR for 900 m or 2000 m. The Mood Check List-short form 2 consisting of “Pleasantness,” “Relaxation,” and “Anxiety” subscales, a Feeling Scale, and a Comfortable Feeling Scale were used to evaluate participants’ mood states before and after exercise. Exercise intensity during CSPR was determined using the Ratings Perceived Exertion scale, heart rate, and %HRmax. A comparison of the exercise intensity during CSPR for the two <b>running</b> <b>distances</b> revealed that <b>running</b> speed was significantly lower for the 2, 000 m distance among female participants only. This demonstrates that running speed during CSPR was influenced by the distance. No significant differences in the other measures of exercise intensity were observed. Compared to before CSPR, increased pleasure and decreased relaxation and anxiety were observed after CSPR for both <b>running</b> <b>distances.</b> The present results suggest that <b>running</b> even short <b>distances</b> can induce positive feelings. Furthermore, as people adjust their comfortable self-established pace based on the distance, stress-reduction effects can be obtained even at a distance of 900 m...|$|R
