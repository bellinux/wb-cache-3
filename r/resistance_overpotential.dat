40|$|A {{common problem}} in the {{electrowinning}} industry is that of maintaining a uniform current density Across both surfaces of each electrode, while also ensuring that the current is equally shared among all the electrodes and cells throughout an operating tankhouse. One way to study this problem is to Model the current distribution both on each electrode and between electrodes and cells in a simulated tankhouse. A circuit analysis approach has been implemented to model the current distribution within a simulated tankhouse using off-the-shelf electronic circuit simulation software. An electrode model developed to incorporate the main characteristics of contact and solution <b>resistance,</b> <b>overpotential</b> and reversible potential provides the basic building block {{for the construction of}} a simulated electro-winning tankhouse. The resulting model is flexible and easily modified to allow the simulation of various conditions and changes in parameters so that their effect on the distribution of current in the tankhouse can be evaluated. Several examples will be shown which reveal the effects of poor electrode alignment, electrical Shorts, poor contacts, removal of electrodes and busbar/contact system on the distribution of current in cell and the effects on adjacent cells...|$|E

40|$|A new battery {{simulator}} {{based on}} a hybrid model is proposed in this paper for dynamic discharging behavior and runtime predictions in existing electronic simulation environments, e. g., PSIM, so it can help power circuit designers to develop and optimize their battery-powered electronic systems. The hybrid battery model combines a diffusion model and a switching overpotential model, which automatically switches <b>overpotential</b> <b>resistance</b> mode or <b>overpotential</b> voltage mode to accurately describe the voltage difference between battery electro-motive force (EMF) and terminal voltage. Therefore, this simulator can simply run in an electronic simulation software with less computational efforts and estimate battery performances by further considering nonlinear capacity effects. A linear extrapolation technique is adopted for extracting model parameters from constant current discharging tests, so the EMF hysteresis problem is avoided. For model validation, experiments and simulations in MATLAB and PSIM environments are conducted with six different profiles, including constant loads, an interrupted load, increasing and decreasing loads and a varying load. The results confirm the usefulness and accuracy of the proposed simulator. The behavior and runtime prediction errors can be as low as 3. 1 % and 1. 2 %, respectively...|$|R

The SSC powders were prepared using the glycine-nitrate method and the LSGMC 5 powders were synthesized using the citrate method. The XRD pattern of SSC powders calcined at temperatures higher than 1223 K corresponded {{to a desired}} perovskite structure. With the increase in calcining temperature, {{the size of the}} SSC particles increased, which leaded to a weak adhesion to the electrolyte for corresponding electrodes. The performance of the SSC-LSGMC 5 composite electrodes depended strongly on the calcining temperature of SSC powders, and the electrodes based on SSC calcined at 1223 K exhibited the lowest ohmic resistance and polarization <b>resistance.</b> The <b>overpotential</b> at 973 K in oxygen under 1 A. cm(- 2) current density was as low as 0. 077 V, which was much lower than that of electrodes prepared using solid-state reaction...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{strontium}} content on Cr deposition and poisoning in barium strontium cobalt ferrite electrodes, Ba 1 −xSrxCo 0. 8 Fe 0. 2 O 3 −δ (BSCF, 0. 3 ≤ x ≤ 0. 7), was investigated at 900 ◦C for 20 h with a cathodic polarization of 200 mA cm− 2. In {{contrast to the}} superb and stable electrochemical performance of the BSCF electrodes without interconnects, electrode polarization <b>resistance</b> and <b>overpotential</b> (RE and η) were found to increase for the O 2 reduction reaction on BSCF electrodes {{in the presence of}} Fe-Cr metallic interconnects. Most important, the increase in RE and η values, RE and η measured after polarized at 200 mA cm− 2 for 20 h, increased significantly as the Sr content of the BSCF electrodes was increased, indicating that the Sr content in BSCF electrodes is a governing factor in Cr poisoning. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the BSCF electrodes after the Cr poisoning test at 900 ◦C for 20 h revealed the presence of Cr deposits on the cathode surface. The magnitude of Cr deposits on the electrode surface under the rib of the interconnect is significantly higher than that under the channel of the interconnect. The results in this study indicate that Sr and/or Ba segregation {{plays an important role in}} the Cr deposition and poisoning for the O 2 reduction on BSCF cathodes, which is closely related to the Ba/Sr ratio of the cathode...|$|R

A four-probe DC conductivity measurement demonstrated that BCFN has a modest electrical conductivity of 2 – 15 S cm− 1 in air with p-type semiconducting behavior. An electrical conductivity relaxation test showed that BCFN has higher Dchem and Kchem than the well-known Ba 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 Co 0. 8 Fe 0. 2 O 3 −δ oxide. In addition, it has relatively low thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) with values of 18. 2 × 10 − 6 K− 1 and 14. 4 × 10 − 6 K− 1 at temperature ranges of 30 – 900 °C and 30 – 500 °C, respectively. The phase reaction between BCFN and BZCY was investigated using powder and pellet reactions. EDX and XRD characterizations demonstrated that BCFN had lower reactivity with the BZCY electrolyte than strontium-containing perovskite oxides such as SrCo 0. 9 Nb 0. 1 O 3 -δ and Ba 0. 6 Sr 0. 4 Co 0. 9 Nb 0. 1 O 3 −δ. The impedance of BCFN was oxygen partial pressure dependent. Introducing water into the cathode atmosphere reduced the size of both the high-frequency and low-frequency arcs of the impedance spectra due to facilitated proton hopping. The cathode polarization <b>resistance</b> and <b>overpotential</b> at a current density of 100 mA cm− 2 were 0. 85 Ω cm− 2 and 110 mV in dry air, which decreased to 0. 43 Ω cm− 2 and 52 mV, respectively, in wet air (∼ 3 % H 2 O) at 650 °C. A decrease in impedance was also observed with polarization time; this was possibly caused by polarization-induced microstructure optimization. A promising peak power density of ∼ 585 mW cm− 2 was demonstrated by an anode-supported cell with a BCFN cathode at 700 °C. <br /...|$|R
40|$|High resistance, which {{limited the}} power output, was {{measured}} {{for both the}} upper and the lower (voltage) discharge plateaus ofa Li-Si/LiC 1 -KC 1 eutectic/FeS 2 cell. Seventy-five {{percent of the total}} resistance has been determined toreside in the porous FeS 2 electrode. A planar Fe electrode, which has a more uniform potential distribution than a porous electrode, was designed to investigate the controlling mechanisms which are responsible for this high resistance. Cyclic voltammet-ric experiments with a planar Fe rotating disk electrode were conducted. It was found that the electrochemical reaction associated with the lower discharge plateau of Li/FeS 2 cells is controlled by mass transport in the solid phase (X-phase), while the electrochemical reaction associated with the upper discharge plateau is controlled by mass transport in the molten salt. This implies that: (i) the particle size in FeSa electrodes has to be minimized {{in order to reduce the}} internal resistance observed for the lower plateau, and (ii) agitation of the molten salt is needed to reduce the internal resistance for the upper plateau.

40|$|The {{instantaneous}} {{efficiency of}} an operating photoelectrochemical solar-fuel-generator {{system is a}} complicated function of the tradeoffs between the light intensity and temperature-dependence of the photovoltage and photocurrent, {{as well as the}} losses associated with factors that include ohmic <b>resistances,</b> concentration <b>overpotentials,</b> kinetic overpotentials, and mass transport. These tradeoffs were evaluated quantitatively using an advanced photoelectrochemical device model comprised of an analytical device physics model for the semiconducting light absorbers in combination with a multi-physics device model that solved for the governing conservation equations in the various other parts of the system. The model was used to evaluate the variation in system efficiency due to hourly and seasonal variations in solar irradiation as well as due to variation in the isothermal system temperature. The system performance characteristics were also evaluated {{as a function of the}} band gaps of the dual-absorber tandem component and its properties, as well as the device dimensions and the electrolyte conductivity. The modeling indicated that the system efficiency varied significantly during the day and over a year, exhibiting local minima at midday and a global minimum at midyear when the solar irradiation is most intense. These variations can be reduced by a favorable choice of the system dimensions, by a reduction in the electrolyte ohmic resistances, and/or by utilization of very active electrocatalysts for the fuel-producing reactions. An increase in the system temperature decreased the annual average efficiency and led to less rapid ramp-up and ramp-down phases of the system, but reduced midday and midyear instantaneous efficiency variations. Careful choice of the system dimensions resulted in minimal change in the system efficiency in response to degradation in the quality of the light absorbing materials. The daily and annually averaged mass of hydrogen production for the optimized integrated system compared favorably to the daily and annually averaged mass of hydrogen that was produced by an optimized stand-alone tandem photovoltaic array connected electrically to a stand-alone electrolyzer system. The model can be used to predict the performance of the system, to optimize the design of solar-driven water splitting devices, and to guide the development of components of the devices as well as of the system as a whole...|$|R
40|$|Various Ni- 15 % Sm 3 + (x) doped CeO 2 (Ni-SDC) {{composite}} anodes {{prepared by}} impregnation method were studied to unveil {{the role of}} SDC in improving the performance of Ni anode. The electrochemical properties and the power generation characteristics of the cells based on these anodes show that {{the performance of the}} cells were improved significantly by the addition of MC into Ni due to the reduced ohmic <b>resistance</b> and anodic <b>overpotential.</b> The decrease of anodic overpotential after the introduction of SDC could be due to the extension of three-phase-boundary(TPB) and the increase of active sites for H- 2 oxidation. However, the introduction of SDC also leaded to an increase of activation energy, which resulted in a higher anodic overpotential for Ni-SDC anodes at low temperatures compared with pure Ni. The impedance spectra of Ni-SDC anode consisted of two arcs at high temperatures. The high frequency arc increased with the amount of SDC, while the low frequency arc showed no dependency on the amount of SDC. The high frequency arc could be related to the charge transfer reaction at TPB, and the low frequency arc could correspond to the disassociative adsorption of H- 2 and the following diffusion processes. 75 % (w) Ni- 25 % (w) SDC/LSGM/SSC exhibited the highest power density among the cells studied, and the highest power density at 1073, 973, 873 K reached 1. 1, 0. 43, 0. 14 W. cm(- 2), respectively.

40|$|Electrochemical {{techniques}} provide {{convenient and}} environmentally compatible ways of bringing about chemical transformations. However they generally lose their economic viability when used with low conducting electrolyte systems. This has limited their usefulness {{in the treatment}} of water and wastewater. Increasing the electrolyte concentration of these systems is not an option as it is with industrial processes such as the chlor-alkali process. Cell resistance is the major limiting factor. Cell resistance can be reduced by reducing the inter-electrode gap. A novel micro gap perforated electrode flow through (PEFT) cell has been developed for efficient and cost effective treatment of aqueous systems of low ionic strength. The PEFT cell is an undivided flow through design which encompasses both parallel plate and porous electrode features. It consists of plate electrodes and flow is both through the electrodes and parallel to the surfaces of the two electrodes. The perforations in the electrodes and the short flow distance between the electrodes allow the inter-electrode gap to be reduced to 50 microns and less without causing excessive resistance to hydraulic flow. With reduced electrical resistance, effective electrochemical treatment of natural water and other low electrolyte systems is possible. The PEFT cell was first applied to overcome a local water supply problem, the Waikato region’s iron and manganese contaminated bore waters. These waters form stable colloidal suspensions during slow air oxidation. The problem can be overcome by rapid electrochemical oxidation using the PEFT cell. Electrochemical oxidation was found to be more effective and efficient than chemical oxidation allowing removal of iron and manganese to meet drinking water standards with minimal formation of disinfection by-products (DBP). Electrochemical oxidation of water and wastewater systems is brought about principally by chlorine mediated indirect oxidation processes. A 240 µm gap PEFT cell, with a graphite anode was used for chlorine generation. It produced chlorine at current efficiencies above 60 % with an energy consumption of 4. 83 kWh/kg of chlorine from a 0. 5 mol/L NaCl solution. This result compares well with industrial hypochlorite production using an undivided cell. Chlorine mediated electro-oxidation of effluents was successfully demonstrated by the degradation of textile dyes in water. Complete single pass electrochemical decolourisation of indigo carmine (IC) dye effluent containing 0. 35 mol/L NaCl was achieved using a graphite anode PEFT cell. Energy consumption was 0. 8 kWh/m 3 or 8. 3 kWh/kg of dye. This is an order of magnitude less than the energy consumption reported for colour removal using graphite anodes. It is comparable or lower than most colour removal work carried out using metal oxide coated dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) and boron doped diamond (BDD) anodes. Reduction of pH from 7 to 3 reduced the energy consumption for decolourisation of IC dye by 50 % and also increased the TOC removal by 20 %. When NaSO 4 was used as the electrolyte rather than sodium chloride, colour removal was much less effective. A single pass through a 50 µm gap PEFT cell with a stainless steel cathode and a graphite anode operated at 5. 5 V achieved a 6 log inactivation of Escherichia coli bacteria in a water sample containing only 1. 7 mmol/L of chloride ions. The power consumption was 0. 5 kWh/m 3 of water. The narrow inter-electrode gap allows high electric fields to be produced from low applied voltages. When the cell was operated at above 5. 0 volts, a synergistic electric field effect was observed. Specific lethality of the chlorine was increased to at least 50 L/(mgmin), approximately two orders of magnitude higher than {{in the absence of the}} field. Increased specific lethality means that disinfection can be achieved at much lower free available chlorine levels than previously possible. This reduces the risk of DBP formation. Improved current efficiencies and reduced energy consumption for electrolysis at low electrolyte concentrations were achieved by partial insulation of the active anode surface of a 50 µm gap PEFT cell. This electro-catalytic effect was consistent with enhanced transport of the electroactive species to the active part of the electrode, reducing concentration and <b>resistance</b> <b>overpotentials.</b> In the electrochemical production of chlorine from 0. 85 mmol/L NaCl at a current density of 2 mA/cm 2, current efficiency was tripled and power consumption was reduced by a factor of two, relative to the cell without the anode modification. The reduction in the inter-electrode gap to 50 µm and less has allowed the production of electric field strengths greater than 10 kV/cm from applied voltages of less than a 100 V. Field strengths between 1 and 10 kV/cm are known to cause reversible electroporation whereas irreversible electroporation occurs above 10 kV/cm. Evidence for irreversible electroporation was provided by the 6 log inactivation of Escherichia coli (in the absence of chlorine) at an applied electric field of 22. 5 kV/cm generated in a 40 µm gap PEFT cell by a 90 V DC supply. The energy consumption was 430 J/mL and without cooling, the temperature remained below 42 oC. Inactivation was achieved by 20 hydrodynamically generated DC pulses. The low applied voltage, the elimination of the need for pulsed electric fields, avoidance of external cooling and the simplicity of the experiment bring commercial non thermal electro-pasteurisation one step closer...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} for improvement of the microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) has been {{the reduction of the}} cost of the cathode catalyst. As catalyst at the cathode, microorganisms offer great possibilities. Previous research has shown the principle possibilities for the biocathode for H 2 production with mixed microbial communities. In this thesis we analyzed the microbial communities from several biocathodes for H 2 production. The microbial population of the very first MEC biocathode for H 2 production (Chapter 2) showed a dominant population of Desulfovibrio spp [...] A member of those dominant species, Desulfovibrio strain G 11 was reinoculated in a biocathode and produced current and H 2. On basis of previous knowledge of known Desulfovibrio spp., the molecular mechanism of electron uptake from a cathode with H 2 production was proposed to have similarities to mechanisms that have been proposed for syntrophic growth. In Chapter 3 the microbial population of 5 more MEC biocathodes was analyzed. Those MECs were fed with either acetate or bicarbonate and consisted of two different designs. The results showed that the microbial communities from the same setup design are more similar than fed with the same carbon source. Furthermore, ribotypes from the phyla, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were found to be dominant. To understand more on the mechanisms of H 2 production in the MEC, a hydrogenase gene microarray was used to analyze the hydrogenase genes present in 3 of the cathode samples. Those results showed that genes coding for bidirection NAD(P) dependent hydrogenases were mostly present in the MEC biocathode. Those results suggest a mechanisms involving cytoplasmatic NAD(P) dependent hydrogenases rather than energy converting hydrogenases as proposed before. To understand the molecular mechanisms it is important to obtain pure cultures from the MEC biocathode and test them for biocathode activity. In chapter 4 we describe a Citrobacter species strain PS 2 which was isolated from the MEC biocathode. PS 2 was very similar to other Citrobacter spp. able to produce fermentative H 2 from a diversity of carbon sources. When inoculated in the MEC biocathode fed with pyruvate, current increased and H 2 was produced with comparable efficiencies and production rates as mixed cultures biocathodes. Addition of membrane potential uncouplers nigericin and monensin showed no change in current and H 2 production rates, suggesting that the molecular mechanism does not involve membrane potential driven processes. Finally, in chapter 5, we explored the usefulness of statistical methods to pinpoint which species are most important for MEC performance. We analyzed DGGE profiles from 5 different MEC anodes using two distinct statistical techniques, Radundacy analysis (RDA) and QR factorization (QRE), and tried to link those profiles to experimental data current, <b>resistance,</b> potential and <b>overpotential.</b> The results showed that current was mostly related to species composition and we were able to pinpoint a few band from DGGE that were influencing changes in experimental parameters most. The results showed that both RDA and QRE are useful methods, of which RDA takes all bands into account, but is therefore less precise; QRE is numerical precise but by eliminating bands that explain least of the variation and therefore using QRE might neglect effect of those bands. Altogether, RDA with additional QRE is useful to give an indication of which species from a mixed community are most likely important for MEC performance and can be used to find a focus in mixed community analysis. From our results we conclude that a large diversity of bacteria is able to catalyze the biocathodes reaction for H 2 production. The species that develop at a cathode might be largely influenced by the design of the used setup, which has to be considered when comparing different experiments. In addition, our results suggest that a general mechanism, present in many different bacterial species, is involved in MEC H 2 production. We propose a molecular mechanism involving a series of cytochromes and cytoplasmatic H 2 production by NAD(P) + dependent bidirectional hydrogenases that use energy from electrons derived from the cathode. The biocathode is a promising technology for application in the MEC, although to date the chemical cathodes still outcompete the biocathode, the biocathode offers great possibilities for future applications including production of other products such as ethanol, methane, succinate or acetate.  ...|$|R
