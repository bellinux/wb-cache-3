5|$|In Chicago, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Henry Weems wins $100,000 playing poker against a mobster named Joe Cutrona, though Weems appears ignorant of the basic rules of poker. Suspecting that Weems cheated, Cutrona {{attempts}} to kill him by throwing him off the 29th story of the building they are in. After Weems lands in an access hatch to a basement, he stands <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> and walks away, completely uninjured. Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case. Mulder initially believes the man has the ability to cure himself, but Scully thinks he may just be very lucky by landing in a pile of laundry that was right under the access hatch.|$|E
5|$|Texas {{was stopped}} {{on their first}} drive due to an {{unsuccessful}} fourth down conversion. Baylor's first possession ended when UT's Michael Huff intercepted a pass from Baylor's Terrance Park. Longhorn Jamaal Charles scored a touchdown on the drive but the kick was blocked, giving Texas the only first-quarter score and a 6–0 lead. Texas extended {{the lead in the}} secondquarter with rushing touchdowns from Henry Melton, Jamaal Charles, and Ramonce Taylor. Taylor made two more touchdowns in the thirdquarter and Quan Cosby caught a touchdown pass from Young. In the fourth quarter, Taylor scored his fourthtouchdown and backup quarterback Matt Nordgren scored on an odd play where he was hit and fumbled while scrambling for the goal line but the ball traveled forward at about the same speed he was running and bounced <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> into his hands. Texas won the 2005game 62–0 making it the only shutout of the 2005season for the Longhorns.|$|E

Hamlin's car then slid <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> {{in front of the}} No. 88 and slammed into the left-side door of the car, and the contact was bad enough to send Earnhardt behind the wall, and suffer a 39th-place finish.

25|$|Cleverly {{made his}} fifth defence {{of the title}} against undefeated Russian Sergey Kovalev (21-0-1, 19 KOs) on 17 August 2013 at the Motorpoint Arena in Cardiff. On 9 July 2013, the {{official}} press conference took place to announce the fight. Cleverly, as champion, was given the underdog status by bookmakers. Cleverly said he had trained hard and was expecting the fight to be toughest of his career so far. Kovalev, who knocked out most of his opponents within three rounds, came out throwing heavy shots in the first round, hurt Cleverly badly in the third round, dropping him twice and nearly finishing him off. Kovalev picked things <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> in the fourth, throwing bombs to send Cleverly down {{for a third time}} and the referee waved things off 29 seconds into the round. Cleverly considered retiring after the bout, but decided not to. In October 2013, Cleverly told the Daily Mirror that he wanted to rematch Kovalev.|$|E

Rolling Stone critic Paul Gambaccini called the song as [...] "brilliant and a smash". Music critic Robert Christgau, despite his mixed opinion on the Lola vs. Powerman album, praised the single as [...] "astounding". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic lauded the song for [...] "its crisp, muscular sound, pitched halfway between acoustic folk and hard rock". Ultimate Classic Rock ranked [...] "Lola" [...] as The Kinks' third best song, saying [...] "the great guitar riff that feeds the song is one of Dave's all-time greatest".

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of episode two onwards, {{as part of the}} opening credits, Mr. Bean falls from the sky in a beam of light, accompanied by a choir singing Ecce homo qui est faba ("Behold the man who is a bean"), recorded by Southwark Cathedral Choir in 1990. These opening sequences were initially in black and white in episodes two and three, and were intended by the producers to show his status as an [...] "ordinary man cast into the spotlight". However, later episodes showed Mr. Bean dropping from the night sky in a deserted London street against the backdrop of St Paul's Cathedral. At the end of episodes three and six he is also shown being sucked <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> into the sky in the respective background scenes (black scene in episode 3 and street scene in episode 6). Atkinson has acknowledged that Bean [...] "has a slightly alien aspect to him". In an episode of the animated series, [...] "Double Trouble", the alien aspect of him was used in a storyline, in which he is taken inside a spacecraft with [...] "aliens" [...] who look exactly like him and even have their own plushy toys. In an obvious homage towards the end, the aliens send him back home in a beam of light and music similar to the opening of the original Mr. Bean series. Whether Bean is an extraterrestrial is not made clear.|$|E

40|$|The {{determining}} {{condition for}} poor people is uncertainty. Some societies perform better than others in mitigating this uncertainty. In such societies we observe welfare regimes which reduce the uncertainties of the market to provide for all citizens minimum conditions for reproduction. Such societies are in a minority.

This major work by the London-based artist was commissioned by Fogo Island Arts and presented at the Fogo Island Gallery from September 24, 2014 to April 12, 2015. The book features texts by Melissa Gronlund and Will Holder, a conversation between Rickards and Nicolaus Schafhausen, and striking new photographic imagery drawn from the installation’s physical materials and production process. Like Rickards’ work, the publication aims to bridge the distance between visual experience and its expression in language, whether spoken, written or gestural...|$|R

40|$|Countless {{high profile}} cases like the recent patent {{litigation}} threatening {{to shut down}} the BlackBerry® service have long drawn sharp criticism; and in response, most of the intellectual property (IP) literature argues for the use of weaker, or liability rule, enforcement as a tool for solving the problems of anticompetitive effects and downstream access while still providing sufficient rewards to IP creators. This paper takes an unconventional approach under which rewards don 2 ̆ 7 t matter much, but coordination does matter a great deal. The paper shows how stronger, or property rule, enforcement facilitates the good type of coordination that increases competition and access. The paper further shows how, paradoxically, the reforms urged by IP critics end up facilitating the different, bad type of coordination that decreases competition and access. Simply put, the paper shows how policy debates would be radically improved by consideration of these two different coordination effects. The paper follows the general approach of the field called New Institutional Economics (2 ̆ 2 NIE 2 ̆ 2), which has explored many problems that are triggered by different institutions of laws and norms. Because no institution is perfect, the NIE approach suggests that our choices among institutions must be informed by our views of the solutions we most want and the problems we can best mitigate or bear. The paper explores a theory of the institution of property <b>rights</b> <b>backed</b> <b>up</b> by property rules as playing a particular, good role in facilitating coordination among many diverse complementary users of an asset in a way that increases competition and access. Under this view, coordination is offered as an alternative to other goals that have been suggested including internalizing externalities, mitigating rent dissipation, or providing direct incentives, and property is offered as an alternative to other institutions or organizations that also can facilitate this coordination goal, including, norm communities such as open source projects, firms, and government. The paper also shows how property <b>rights</b> <b>backed</b> <b>up</b> by weaker, or liability rule, enforcement can play a particular, bad role in facilitating the kind of coordination among large, established players that decreases competition and access. The shift in focus towards the link between property rule treatment and coordination has several practical effects. First, it explains why many of reform proposals of yesterday and today that do not use the coordination approach should be expected to exacerbate the two key persistent problems of anticompetitive effect and reduced downstream access. Second, it explains why certain aspects of IP regimes may be working well and why others may be candidates for change or elimination. Third, it elucidates factors that cut against changing IP regimes in ways that likely will exacerbate the two key persistent problems of anticompetitive effect and reduced downstream access. Providing one example of how the coordination approach could inform practical policy discussions, the paper frames a discussion for evaluating a case against the present copyright regime...|$|R
