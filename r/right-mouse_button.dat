However, he expressed that he was pleased with how LucasArts allowed him {{to stay close to}} his original vision for the game. The game's various minigames were included to allow players to take a break from solving the main game's puzzles and play something [...] "short and silly". Sam & Max Hit the Road also signified a major change in development for games on the SCUMM engine. The user interface was entirely rehauled from that introduced in Maniac Mansion and built upon in subsequent games. Instead of selecting a verb function from a list {{at the bottom of the}} screen and clicking on an in-game entity, Sam & Max Hit the Road compressed all verb functions into the mouse cursor, which players could cycle through using the <b>right-mouse</b> <b>button.</b> The inventory was also moved off the main screen to a sub-screen accessible by a small icon on the screen. According to Steve Purcell, this cleared space on the screen to [...] "expand on the excellent backgrounds and also made interaction much quicker and less laborious than LucasArts' previous adventure games" [...] The conversation trees were also affected by this; Michael Stemmle proposed removing the text-based selection menu used in previous LucasArts' adventure games in favor of icons representing topics of discussion as [...] "nothing would kill a joke worse than reading it before you hear it". Several of these innovations were retained for future LucasArts adventure games.|$|E

50|$|Controls and {{graphics}} {{are typical of}} a Real-Time Strategy game; using the left-mouse button to select your unit(s), the <b>right-mouse</b> <b>button</b> to command movement or an action of the selected unit(s). Camera work takes typical angles of the RTS genre.|$|E
50|$|The macOS Dock {{also has}} {{extended}} menus that control applications without making them visible on screen. On most applications it has simple options such as Quit, Keep In Dock, Remove From Dock, and other options, though some applications use these menus for other purposes, such as iTunes, which uses this menu {{as a way}} for a user to control certain playback options. Other Applications include changing the status of an online alias (MSN, AIM/iChat etc.) or automatically saving the changes that have been made in a document (There is no current application with this feature made available for macOS). Docklings (in Mac OS X 10.4 or earlier) can also be opened by using the <b>right-mouse</b> <b>button,</b> if the mouse has one, {{but most of the time}} either clicking and holding or control-click will bring the menu up.|$|E
