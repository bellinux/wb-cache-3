40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes the {{hypothesis}} that multilateralism and regionalism are complementary, and that <b>regional</b> income <b>convergence</b> is likely with a like minded and committed regionalism that often has links geographically and culturally. The association between international trade, income per capita, and <b>regional</b> income <b>convergence</b> in founder members of ASEAN and SAARC, is explored by applying the Lumsdaine, and Papell approach. The causal relationships between the above variables are also studied in respective trade blocs by using Granger causality tests. The conclusion is that global reforms have had {{a greater impact on}} increasing trade for both trade blocs and induced convergence only in ASEAN- 5 countries. The experience of ASEAN countries shows a two-way causal relationship between the flow from trade to <b>regional</b> income <b>convergence,</b> and vice versa. There is no evidence in SAARC countries for income convergence and causality. Keywords—ASEAN- 5, SAARC- 5, trade liberalisation, income convergence, structural breaks and causality. I...|$|R

Most of the juveniles were aged 10 through 17 {{and referred to}} the program by school officials, parents, and law enforcement for involvement in delinquency and criminal activity. The study examined delinquent as well as non delinquent hangout locations. Each juvenile was given a survey to establish their personal nods and pathways. Locations were classified as being a <b>regional</b> <b>convergence</b> setting (schools, movie theaters, and malls) or a local activity node (fast food outlets, video store, and the primary hangout location when not at home or school). Access to vehicles has been significantly correlated to delinquency (Anderson and Hughes 2009) and distance traveled to crimesites (e.g., Snook 2004; Van Koppen and de Keijser 1997). Of the 2,248 youth with usable information: 28 percent of youth sweat (walk, skateboard,or bicycle to activity nodes); 64.2 percent use vehicles (own car, friend's car, family car); and 7.8 percent use other methods (public transportation {{or a combination of}} methods). The results showed youth typically travel between 1.5 and 7.8 miles to key activity nodes. Locations visited more frequently generally were closer to the juvenile's home. Local activity nodes are under two miles from home whereas, convergence settings are substantially farther (2.4 to 7.8 miles). Distances traveled to movie theaters and shopping facilities show greater variability than the other locations. The youth that sweat (walk, ride bicycles, or skateboards) spend more time closer to home but youths with cars visit places much further from home. The older youths traveled further away from home. the median distance traveled to school ("crime trip") fell between typical travel to local hangouts and travel to other convergence settings.|$|E
