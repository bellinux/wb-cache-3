40|$|Two new Finnish {{mitigation}} guides {{have been}} issued. The first guide gives basic information and practical examples on all mitigation {{methods and results}} achieved. The second guide is a detailed guide for design and implementation of sub-slab-depressurization (SSD) in low-rise residential houses. The presentation includes many examples from the guide for SSD and radon well and other methods. The most efficient methods are SSD and radon well, typical radon concentration reduction factors being 70 - 90 %. Radon well is effective only on soils where air permeability is high enough; e. g., on gravel and in esker areas. A single radon well can reduce radon concentration in many dwellings at a distance up to 20 - 30 meters. Sealing entry routes and ventilation or pressure-reduction-based measures resulted in lower reduction factors but {{play an important role}} in mitigation practices. The national prevention guide and results achieved are presented. The guide is based on the following measures: use of bitumen felt in the joint of foundation wall and floor slab, sealing of penetrations and installation of <b>radon</b> <b>piping.</b> Radon prevention is essential and required in the whole country. 1...|$|E
40|$|Radon {{reduction}} field demonst rat ions {{to date have}} primarily emphasized depressurization of subfloor and foundation areas using electrical ly powered exhaust fans {{in combination}} with various configurations of <b>radon</b> collection <b>piping</b> and discharge stacks * This approach to 1 ow cost radon reduction has general ly {{proven to be a}} re 1 iable technique. However, field experience during the 1970 's and early 1980 's indicates that passive radon reduction techniques can often achieve desired results while eliminating maintenance and operating costs related to the active radon reduction system techniques. This paper discusses the general concepts related to passive radon reduction techniques, and structure characteristics that lend themsel ves to passive reduction are identified. Data. including generic passive radon reduction system designs and related field project experience, are presented...|$|R
