25|$|The Hudson Depot or Hudson Pier Depot {{was located}} on Hudson <b>River</b> <b>Pier</b> 57 at 15th Street {{in the present}} Hudson River Park in Chelsea, Manhattan. The address was 11 11th Avenue. This depot was built from 1950 to 1954 as a {{shipping}} pier. The pier was abandoned in 1967 by Grace Line and remained unused for several years. In December 1971, the New York City Transit Authority took possession of the vacant building, and upgraded it to facilitate bus fueling and storage. This was opposed by the International Longshoremen's Association, who desired the facility to be reactivated for maritime operations, and by local civic organizations. The depot opened on September 11, 1972, replacing the 12th Street Depot, and providing indoor storage for over 200 buses previously parked on city streets. It held up to 165 buses. The Hudson Depot {{was intended to be}} temporary, but was kept in service when plans to construct new depots failed, and due to the closure of the 54th Street Depot. The depot was closed on September 7, 2003, the same day the 100th Street Depot reopened, and its routes such as the M8, M10, M11, M13, M14A/M14D, M20, M21, M22, M23, M16/M34, and half of the Q32 were transferred to both the 100th Street Depot and the reopened Michael J. Quill Depot (except the M10, and M11, transferred to Manhattanville, and later some M11 and M116 runs were shared with Michael J.Quill Depot in an effort to ease the severe overcrowding at Manhattanville Depot, where many of their buses are stored on the local streets during nighttime hours).|$|E

El Toro was built principally as a fire boat with towing capability to tow the Morgan Line ships arriving or departing New York between the passenger terminal at North <b>River</b> <b>Pier</b> 37 and the cargo terminal at Pier 25.

From the middle of the first arch the line curves to a temporary timber viaduct erected along the west side of the intended bridge. The height of this viaduct is one hundred and twenty feet to the level of the rails; it is built upon piles, which are driven between thirty and forty feet into the bed of the river. Its stability was sufficiently tested on Monday, when Captain Leffan (sic), the Government Inspector of Railways, examined it preparatory to the opening. On that day, two powerful engines weighing upwards of seventy tons, traversed it at different degrees of speed for between two and three hours; the weight would be about one ton to a foot, being four or five times greater than the temporary structure will ever be required to bear, and the result was, in the highest degree, satisfactory.|$|E
2500|$|Dean, having {{obtained}} divorce {{papers in}} Mexico, had first returned to New York to marry Inez, only {{to leave her}} {{and go back to}} Camille. After his recovery from dysentery in Mexico, Sal returns to New York in the fall. He finds a girl, Laura, and plans to move with her to San Francisco. Sal writes to Dean about his plan to move to San Francisco. Dean writes back saying that he's willing to come and accompany Laura and Sal. Dean arrives over five weeks early, but Sal is out taking a late-night walk alone. Sal returns home, sees a copy of Proust, and knows it is Dean's. Sal realizes his friend has arrived, but at a time when Sal doesn't have the money to relocate to San Francisco. On hearing this Dean makes the decision to head back to Camille. Sal's friend Remi Boncoeur denies Sal's request to give Dean a short lift to 40th Street {{on their way to a}} Duke Ellington concert at the Metropolitan Opera House. Sal's girlfriend Laura realizes this is a painful moment for Sal and prompts him for a response as the party drives off without Dean. Sal replies: [...] "He'll be alright".

Two images of the Buddha, which represent the first two kings of the Chakri dynasty, flank the main image. Over the years, the temple has retained its original design. However, minor improvements have been effected after its first erection during Rama I's reign; wood-work of the temple was replaced by King Rama III and King Chulalongkorn; during King Mongkut's reign, the elegant doors and windows and the copper plates on the floor were additions, Rama III refurbished the wall painting (indicative of the universe according to Buddhist cosmology) and several frescoes that display the various stages of the Buddha's life; three chambers were added on the western side by King Mongkut; in the chamber known as 'Phra Kromanusorn' at the northern end, images of Buddha have been installed in honour of the kings of Ayutthaya; and in the 19th century, Khrua In Khong, a famous painter executed the wall murals.
