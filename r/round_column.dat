25|$|From east to west, {{the first}} {{fountain}} is the Läuferbrunnen (German: Runner fountain) near the Nydegg Church on Nydeggstalden. The trough {{was built in}} 1824, but the figure dates from 1545. The Runner has moved several times since its creation, and until about 1663 {{was known as the}} Brunnen beim unteren Tor (Fountain by the lower gate). Originally the Läuferbrunnen had an octagonal trough and a tall, <b>round</b> <b>column.</b> The trough was replaced with a rectangular trough before 1757 which was replaced in 1824. The <b>round</b> <b>column</b> was replaced with the current square limestone pillar in the eighteenth or nineteenth century.|$|E

2500|$|The {{sculpture}} is {{carved from}} a single block of white Carrara marble – a rare medium for Giambologna. The surface is highly finished and in good condition aside from some drill and rasp marks. It depicts a nude young woman {{in the act of}} washing, seated in an awkward position on a truncated column. She is voluptuous and fleshy in the usual Mannerist way. She has a blank, inscrutable expression, and wavy, centrally-parted hair. Her straight nose reflects classical Roman sculpture. There is a bracelet on her left arm, and a chemise or shift with embroidered cuffs is draped across her left thigh. The woman's pose is complex, with her weight resting mostly on her left buttock, which is seated on a <b>round</b> <b>column</b> from which drapery hangs. According to art historian Peggy Fogelman, [...] "With one leg and both arms positioned in front of her, the figure's weight and the compositional balance seem tilted forward". Her left leg is raised; her knee sharply bent. The head is inclined downwards, and her eyes are blank. She holds an ointment jar in her left hand, raised high above her head. Her right hand holds a small cloth which she uses to clean her left foot.|$|E

Its base remains along with the three other <b>round</b> <b>columns</b> and two square columns.|$|R
