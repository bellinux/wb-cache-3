40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate cellulase adsorption and recycling during enzymatic hydrolysis of two differently pretreated wheat straws (WS). Dilute acid treated WS showed lower hydrolysis yield of polysaccharides fraction and adsorbed more cellulase with hydrolyzed residue than dilute alkali treated sample. Four methods capable of recovering and recycling the enzyme bound to the residual substrate and the enzyme free in solution were used for three consecutive rounds of hydrolysis to compare their <b>recycling</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> Compared to the absorption recycling method, ultrafiltration recycling method possessed the capacity to retain p-glucosidase, thereby avoiding the supplementation of fresh p-glucosidase in subsequent rounds of hydrolysis. It was found that whatever recycling method was used, better recycling results were obtained for dilute alkali treated substrate than for dilute acid treated substrate.

40|$|Formation of {{isoprene}} nitrates (INs) is {{an important}} free radical chain termination step ending production of ozone and possibly affecting formation of secondary organic aerosol. Isoprene nitrates also represent a large, unmeasured contribution to OH reactivity and are a major pathway {{for the removal of}} nitrogen oxides from the atmosphere. Current assessments indicate that formation rates of isoprene nitrates are uncertain to a factor of 2 – 3 and the subsequent fate of isoprene nitrates remains largely unconstrained by laboratory, field or modeling studies. Measurements of total alkyl and multifunction nitrates (ΣANs), NO 2, total peroxy nitrates (ΣPNs), HNO 3, H 2 CO, isoprene and other VOC were obtained from the NASA DC- 8 aircraft during summer 2004 over the continental US during the INTEX-NA campaign. These observations represent the first characterization of ΣANs over a wide range of land surface types and in the free troposphere. ΣANs were a significant, 12 – 20 %, fraction of NO y throughout the experimental domain and ΣANs were more abundant when isoprene was high. We use the observed VOC to calculate the relative contributions of ΣAN precursors to their production. These calculations indicate that isoprene represents at least 76 % of the ΣAN source in the summertime continental boundary layer of the US. An observed correlation between ΣANs and CH 2 O is used to place constraints on nitrate yields from isoprene oxidation, atmospheric lifetimes of the resulting nitrates and <b>recycling</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of nitrates during subsequent oxidation. We recommend sets of production rates, lifetimes and <b>recycling</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of INs as follows [4. 4 %, 5 h, 92 %], [8 %, 2. 5 h, 84 %] and [12 %, 90 min, 74 %]. The analysis indicates that the lifetime of ΣANs as a pool of compounds is considerably longer than the lifetime of the individual isoprene nitrates to reaction with OH, implying that the organic nitrate functionality is at least partially maintained through a second oxidation cycle...|$|R

The model considers a diversity of plant organic compounds and a diversity of microbial species. Nutrient <b>recycling</b> <b>efficiency</b> from organic compounds to decomposers is then the key parameter that controls ecosystem processes (primary productivity, secondary productivity, producer biomass and decomposer biomass). The model predicts that microbial diversity has a positive effect on nutrient <b>recycling</b> <b>efficiency</b> and ecosystem processes through either greater intensity of microbial exploitation of organic compounds or functional niche complementarity, much like in plants. Microbial niche breadth and overlap should not affect ecosystem processes unless they increase the number of organic compounds that are decomposed.

40|$|We {{present a}} dynamic model of global copper stocks and flows which allows a {{detailed}} analysis of <b>recycling</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> copper stocks in use, and dissipated and landfilled copper. The model is based on historical mining and refined copper production data (1910 - 2010) enhanced by a unique data set of recent global semifinished goods production and copper end-use sectors provided by the copper industry. To enable the consistency of the simulated copper life cycle in terms of a closed mass balance, particularly the matching of recycled metal flows to reported historical annual production data, a method was developed to estimate the yearly global collection rates of end-of-life (postconsumer) scrap. Based on this method, we provide estimates of 8 different recycling indicators over time. The main indicator for the efficiency of global copper recycling from end-of-life (EoL) scrap - the EoL recycling rate - was estimated to be 45 % on average, ± 5 % (one standard deviation) due to uncertainty and variability over time in the period 2000 - 2010. As uncertainties of specific input data?mainly concerning assumptions on end-use lifetimes and their distribution?are high, a sensitivity analysis with regard to the effect of uncertainties in the input data on the calculated recycling indicators was performed. The sensitivity analysis included a stochastic (Monte Carlo) uncertainty evaluation with 105 simulation runs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCopepods {{represent}} {{a major component}} of the Antarctic food web in terms of biomass turnover. Although important in abundance, {{little is known about the}} life cycle strategies of the small species. Within the framework of the SO-JGOFS, we investigated the distribution of small copepods (< 2. 0 mm) in relation to the hydrography of the Antarctic Polar Front during summer 1995 / 96. The community of small copepods was dominated by Oithona similis, followed by Oithona frigida and Ctenocalanus citer. The total abundance of these copepods was extremely high throughout the study area with peaks of up to 49, 000 ind. m- 3, to which naupliar and early copepodid stages (CI-CIII) contributed a high percentage. The accumulation of such a high standing-stock of small copepods is probably related to retention mechanisms provided by the meandering structure of the frontal system and to the biology of the dominant species Oithona similis, Oithona frigida and Ctenocalanus citer. Stage distribution and metabolic demand of the dominant species indicate a very active and productive zooplankton community with high grazing pressure on smaller plankton particles and faecal material, leading to high <b>recycling</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and low export rates due to sinking material.

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{functioning of}} estuarine environments is {{greatly influenced by}} human activity. One {{of the most important}} perturbations lies in the increased inputs of nutrients, mainly nitrogen (N), to these systems. This N is submitted to various biogeochemical processes leading to recycling, retention and export to the sea. In this article we present results from 15 N-incubation experiments allowing the simultaneous determination of NH 4 + and NO 3 – uptake, nitrification and ammonification rates in the waters of a eutrophic temperate macrotidal estuary (the Scheldt in Belgium and The Netherlands) for different seasons. These are compared to whole estuarine nitrogen budgets. Results showed that nitrogen cycling in this system is dominated in all seasons by the mineralization of organic matter leading to a supply of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) exceeding river inputs. During winter, summer and fall seasons, only 6 to 10 % of this DIN is recycled by microorganisms and most is eliminated (50 to 60 %), probably by denitrification in the sediments, and exported (30 to 40 %) to the sea. In spring, a larger fraction of DIN (around 70 %) is recycled by microorganisms, while only 2 % is eliminated and 26 % is exported. Overall, we conclude that turbid eutrophic temperate estuaries as the Scheldt may have low DIN <b>recycling</b> <b>efficiencies</b> because of low in situ primary production except in spring. ...|$|R

The {{results indicate that}} MRE is likely inapplicable to quoting the metal recyclability of waste PCBs because it makes the recycling of any metal is equal to each other (e. g. recycling of 1 kg of gold {{is as important as}} recycling of 1 kg of iron). RRE and QWERTY can overcome the poor yardstick of MRE because they concern not only the weight of recycled materials but also the contribution of recycled materials to the natural resource conservation and the environmental impact reduction, respectively. These two approaches, however, report an extremely different result, that makes the target stakeholders get confused with which material recycled. From the findings of the aforementioned analysis, this study proposes the Model for Evaluating Metal <b>Recycling</b> <b>Efficiency</b> from Complex Scraps (MEMRECS) as a new approach to quotes the metal recycling performance. MEMRECS allows a trade-offs between three criteria: mass, environmental impacts and natural resources conservation, hence it can provide the result in a sustainable sound manner.

40|$|The {{recycling}} of metals is {{widely viewed as}} a fruitful sustainability strategy, but little information {{is available on the}} degree to which recycling is actually taking place. This article provides an overview on the current knowledge of recycling rates for 60 metals. We propose various recycling metrics, discuss relevant aspects of recycling processes, and present current estimates on global end-of-life recycling rates (EOL-RR; i. e., the percentage of a metal in discards that is actually recycled), recycled content (RC), and old scrap ratios (OSRs; i. e., the share of old scrap in the total scrap flow). Because of increases in metal use over time and long metal in-use lifetimes, many RC values are low and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Because of relatively low efficiencies in the collection and processing of most discarded products, inherent limitations in recycling processes, and the fact that primary material is often relatively abundant and low-cost (which thereby keeps down the price of scrap), many EOL-RRs are very low: Only for 18 metals (silver, aluminum, gold, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, niobium, nickel, lead, palladium, platinum, rhenium, rhodium, tin, titanium, and zinc) is the EOL-RR above 50 % at present. Only for niobium, lead, and ruthenium is the RC above 50 %, although 16 metals are in the 25 % to 50 % range. Thirteen metals have an OSR greater than 50 %. These estimates may be used in considerations of whether <b>recycling</b> <b>efficiencies</b> can be improved; which metric could best encourage improved effectiveness in recycling; and an improved understanding of the dependence of recycling on economics, technology, and other factors...|$|R
