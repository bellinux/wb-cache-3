What will the role of research in higher education be, in response to the challenge of an active future contribution to human and social development? A good balance must be reached in the basic functions of research in order to avoid governance risks. While focusing only on the transformative function of research may pose dangers to the human dimension and development, unilateral concentration on responsible development aspects may generate reactive approaches and delay economic benefits.

The sample consisted of 171 students in grades 7, 8 and 9 and their three corresponding math teachers. The researcher administered questionnaires to students concerning their attitudes toward math, interviewed teachers and conducted classroom observations. The results of the study showed that girls and boys in grades 7, 8 and 9 held similar moderately positive attitudes toward mathematics. With respect to achievement, no significant differences were found in math averages between boys and girls. Results also showed that teachers were not gender biased in their choice of the most successful students. They attributed girls’ success to ability and effort whereas boys’ success was attributed to ability and intrinsic motivation. Finally, the classroom observations showed that the number of boys who participated in class exceeded that of girls.

40|$|Background Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is {{a complex}} genetic {{syndrome}} associated with hyperphagia and behavioural problems. Recent research suggested a link between hyperphagia and behavioural and emotional problems in PWS such as anger and anxiety. The current study aimed to explore this relationship further. Method Through parental report postal questionnaires, data was collected on the age, gender, weight, hyperphagia and behavioural and emotional problems of 105 children with PWS aged 4 - 18 years (M: 9. 63 years). Results Following preliminary analysis, a series of multiple regressions were performed. Hyperphagic drive significantly predicted antisocial/disruptive behaviour, anxiety, social relating problems, communication disturbances and self-absorbed behaviours. Whilst hyperphagic behaviour {{did not significantly predict}} any behavioural/emotional problems. Conclusions This study <b>reinforces</b> <b>research</b> which has suggested an association between hyperphagia and non-food related behaviour in PWS.

It is believed that culture has a role in unraveling the mystery. And we employ codes in plans design, derived from culture in an attempt to delineate the nature of the mysterious liquidity; but the outcomes were so different to believe ineffective a recourse to theoretical generalizations, and always adventurous the understanding of the singularity of the specific condition.

40|$|Abstract Background Antimicrobial {{resistance}} (AMR) in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a {{major public}} health concern worldwide. In Vietnam, knowledge regarding N. gonorrhoeae prevalence and AMR is limited, and data concerning genetic characteristics of N. gonorrhoeae is totally lacking. Herein, we investigated the phenotypic AMR (previous, current and possible future treatment options), genetic resistance determinants for extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs), and genotypic distribution of N. gonorrhoeae isolated in 2011 in Hanoi, Vietnam. Methods N. gonorrhoeae isolates from Hanoi, Vietnam isolated in 2011 (n[*]=[*] 108) were examined using antibiograms (Etest for 10 antimicrobials), Neisseria gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST), and sequencing of ESC resistance determinants (penA, mtrR and penB). Results The levels of in vitro resistance were as follows: ciprofloxacin 98 %, tetracycline 82 %, penicillin G 48 %, azithromycin 11 %, ceftriaxone 5 %, cefixime 1 %, and spectinomycin 0 %. The MICs of gentamicin (0. 023 - 6 [*]mg/L), ertapenem (0. 002 - 0. 125 [*]mg/L) and solithromycin (penA mosaic alleles were found, however, 78 % of the isolates contained an alteration of amino acid A 501 (A 501 V (44 %) and A 501 T (34 %)) in the encoded penicillin-binding protein 2. A single nucleotide (A) deletion in the inverted repeat of the promoter region of the mtrR gene and amino acid alterations in MtrR was observed in 91 % and 94 % of the isolates, respectively. penB resistance determinants were detected in 87 % of the isolates. Seventy-five different NG-MAST STs were identified, of which 59 STs have not been previously described. Conclusions In Vietnam, the highly diversified gonococcal population displayed high in vitro resistance to antimicrobials previously recommended for gonorrhoea treatment (with exception of spectinomycin), but resistance also to the currently recommended ESCs were found. Nevertheless, the MICs of three potential future treatment options were low. It is essential to strengthen the diagnostics, case reporting, and epidemiologic surveillance of gonorrhoea in Vietnam. Furthermore, the surveillance of gonococcal AMR and gonorrhoea treatment failures is imperative to <b>reinforce.</b> <b>Research</b> regarding novel antimicrobial treatment strategies (e. g., combination therapy) and new antimicrobials is crucial for future treatment of gonorrhoea. </p...|$|E
40|$|Computer based {{supply chain}} simulation, optimization, and {{visualization}} capability have changed {{significantly in the}} past 45 years, expanding capability in lockstep with increases in computational power. The increase in accessibility of relatively cheap and powerful hardware {{has led to the}} development of a multitude of supply chain simulation, optimization, and visualization programs catered towards reducing corporate supply chain costs. Some of these programs are commercial business to business offerings, while a significant set are developed internally within the corporation. Expertise in this field is increasingly seen as an area of competitive advantage for modern goods based corporations. However, the danger lies in executing decisions based upon inaccurate simulation results, often meaning millions of dollars lost in waste rather than the desired savings. This thesis aims to identify the needs of a corporation regarding supply chain simulation, optimization, and visualization - particularly how a company may categorize offerings within this field - how these programs may fit within the organizational context of a company, and how to ensure correct utilization of a set of supply chain programs. Supply chain is very well understood, but little focus has been placed on correctly utilizing these programs to support success for a company's goal of becoming operationally efficient. A current state analysis of a major U. S. manufacturing company, Caterpillar, Inc., was conducted and a new framework was applied to understand Caterpillar's usage of supply chain programs. This thesis utilizes findings from Caterpillar as a sample case to <b>reinforce</b> <b>research.</b> An overall strategy is developed based on research at Caterpillar, and supports the creation of a group of internal experts disassociated from specific supply chain specialties, such as procurement or logistics, in order to ensure global efficiency.

40|$|Conference paper {{presented}} at the 1 st African Conference on Sustainable Tourism in Strathmore University, Kenya. By the time being, Rwanda has embarked on public university reform of ``One university system``. This requires means and methods in order to conserve and protect the acquired progresses, but also {{in order to meet the}} challenges the society is facing in development. In its triple missions of teaching, learning, research and community outreach, broadly, universities in this country must <b>reinforce</b> <b>research</b> so as to innovate and orient Rwanda society. Thus, Universities and higher learning institutions must play a very big role in promoting sustainable development considering their place in research and modern education. Universities must shape education for a changing world trough specifically new learning theories that recognize basically that cognitive, cultural and social dimension are important in education process and balance between education for sustainability and environmental sustainability. Thus the system of knowledge transfer at university level should give enough emphasis to reflexive and transformative knowledge and avoid the image of historical alienation inherited from colonialists where scientific truth is largely dominated by positivist and theoretical approaches of knowledge and reality. Because working towards sustainable development seems to require substantial reorientation of university research program that focuses to dynamic interactions between nature and the society. It requires a new manner of conducting research activities using a full commitment to seeking solutions to sustainable development challenges on one hand, but also re-think a type of research methodology and understand how research in general is thought, conceptualized and implemented. The paper is intended to highlight the main problems the HLIs in RWANDA are facing in research field and give tentative solutions in order to contribute to research for sustainable development. As far as Education is concerned, the paper seeks in seeing how research is delivered and show the good methodologies to contribute to a society knowledge and competences based. The approaches considered are both multi-disciplinary, interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary in mobilizing the scientific community to integrate different knowledge systems. Here, researchers should look first of all to the logical and realistic origin of the activity they are conducting and gain a better perspective of the research priorities in contemporary contexts. The RWANDA case study will be an illustrative example of a type of research that seeks to point out the main challenges faced by third world countries, but also in a manner that guarantee the success of new approaches and best practices while well oriented and managed even during reform periods in tertiary education in order to promote sustainable development...|$|E
