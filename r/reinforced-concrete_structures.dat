40|$|Abstract: Norms for {{projecting}} {{concrete and}} <b>reinforced-concrete</b> <b>structures</b> consider {{the influence of}} aggressive environments and regimes onto the resistance of reinforced concrete indirectly and overly-generally (the system of reliability coefficients). Direct evaluation of the projected service life of constructed buildings or the remaining service life of existing buildings and facilities from reinforced concrete is not regulated by the effective norms. Focusing on protection of structures from corrosions or overcoming the consequences of corrosive damage hampers the full optimal use of capabilities of reinforced concrete and it often is not cost-efficient due to excessive expenses and limited service life of the facility. Besides the high costs, the under-development of the issues with solving the tasks of predicting extreme states of <b>reinforced-concrete</b> <b>structures</b> under combines loading and environmental influences poses humanitarian and environmental dangers. Presence of uncontrollable technical risks is directly manifested in worrying statistics of accidents and emergency situations in construction objects. The present article notes the importance of developing methodologically uniform approaches to evaluation of operational and extreme states of reinforced-concrete elements under combined influences of loads and aggressive environment.

40|$|Based on a {{proposed}} bond stress distribution function that was successfully {{applied to the}} analysis of reinforced-concrete members under tension, a two-dimensional smeared crack model for <b>reinforced-concrete</b> <b>structures</b> is presented in this paper. In the model, the tension stiffening effect in cracked reinforced concrete is taken into account in a more appropriate manner. The magnitude of the tension stiffening effect is related to several parameters, namely, the ratio of reinforcement, the diameter of a steel bar, the strength and the cover of concrete and the moduli of reinforcement and concrete. With the derived tangential stress-strain equations for concrete in the direction perpendicular to the cracks, the constitutive relationship for cracked reinforced concrete is established. Several experimental specimens have been analyzed with this analytical model, and good agreements between the analytical and experimental results are obtained.

In recent years, fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) plates have been increasingly used to replace steel plates due to their superior properties. A key issue in the design of an effective retrofitting solution using externally bonded plates is the end anchorage strength. This paper first presents a review of current anchorage strength models for both FRP-to-concrete and steel-to-concrete bonded joints under shear. These models are then assessed with experimental data collected from the literature, revealing the deficiencies of all existing models. Finally, a new simple and rational model is proposed based on existing fracture mechanics analysis and experimental observations. This new model not only matches experimental observations of bond strength closely, but also correctly predicts the effective bond length. The new model is thus suitable for practical application in the design of FRP-to-concrete as well as steel-to-concrete bonded joints. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E

They are used for service life prediction of reinforced concrete structures. Concerning corrosion diagnosis of reinforced concrete, some Non Destructive Testing (NDT) tools have been developed, and have been in use for some years. However, these developments require validation on existing concrete structures. The French project “Benchmark des Poutres de la Rance ” contributes to this aspect.

However, most reinforced concrete structures are statically indeterminate and the behaviour of this type of structure under sustained load has received very little attention. It is important to establish the main differences in time dependent behaviour of statically determinate and indeterminate structure under sustained load so that the validity of extending existing methods of calculation of long term deflection (developed with limited success for determinate structures) to indeterminate structures may be assessed. This investigation is an experimental and theoretical study of the behaviour of statically-indeterminate structures under sustained service loads. All the experimental work was performed in a laboratory where the temperature and humidity were maintained constant. Concrete of the same mix proportions and strength was used throughout the programme and control shrinkage and creep tests were performed on the plain concrete.

Fiber reinforced polymer technology has emerged during the past decade as a particular tool to upgrade existing structures. These materials are an excellent option for use as external reinforcing because of their light weight, resistance to corrosion, and high strength. This thesis introduces a strengthening technique of slab-column connection in flat-slab structures to enhance its flexural strength. Six flat-slab column connections were fabricated and then tested under increasing gravity loading up-to-complete collapse to investigate the effectiveness of using carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets in enhancing their flexural capacity. Each specimen comprised 2000 x 1000 x 150 mm slab, with a 200 x 200 mm column stub extending below and above the slab. The tested specimens consisted of two groups.

Most {{of the damage}} structures were <b>reinforced-concrete</b> <b>structures.</b> From approximately 40 structures investigated by the authors, {{as part of a}} reconnaissance team, it was found that most of the damage was caused by improper construction, such as placement of column splices at column based. It was also found that structures strengthened following the first earthquake in February 2004, either by adding balcony or fa??ade columns, were almost collapse after the second earthquake in November 2004. Additional construction to old existing structures such as balcony without strengthening the existing structures changed the stiffness and the strength configuration resulted in failure. Column failure at the mid-height was an example of this phenomenon. This paper presents results of post-earthquake investigation carried out following the second earthquake in November 2004. The investigated buildings were categorized into several damage levels, and then proposed to be repaired, demolished or reconstructed. One building namely Tabernakel Church was analyzed using the available computer software to check the possible cause for the major damage. It was selected for this study because the building had been repaired and strengthened after the first earthquake, but severely damaged after the second earthquake.

The damage included partial or total collapse of industrial precast <b>reinforced-concrete</b> <b>structures,</b> historical masonry, and mainly nonstructural damage to reinforced-concrete buildings; see Section 8 (Data and sharing resources) for damage report repository. These structural typologies are, in principle, sensitive to different ground-motion intensity measures. For example, loss of support requires significant displacement demand at relatively long periods, while infilling damage {{is due to the}} ground-motion amplitude at higher frequencies, and masonry structures are comparatively more sensitive to the cyclic content of ground shaking. Moreover, because events were concentrated in time and space, {{it can be argued that}} the cumulative effects of the sequence contributed to the damage. As the current seismic code [C. S. LL. PP. 2008] uses a seismic hazard map [Stucchi et al. 2011] to determine the seismic actions for structural design, when a strong earthquake occurs, probabilistic estimates are understandably questioned for their consistency with respect to the observed ground motion. While it is easy to show that in terms of frequency of exceedance of intensity measures, the hazard can hardly be validated via the records of a single earthquake [e. g., Iervolino 2012], on the other hand, it can certainly be verified whether the observations are compatible or atypical with respect to what is predicted by the tools used in best-practice hazard studies. These issues mostly motivated the preliminary analysis briefly presented in this report; i. e., to investigate the engineering seismic demand (peak and cyclic) and to compare this with the prediction models. Both elastic and inelastic demands were considered. Indeed, the inelastic demands are more important from the structural engineering point of view. […]</p...|$|E
40|$|By {{reviewing}} {{some of the}} <b>reinforced-concrete</b> <b>structures</b> {{built in}} the early 20 th century, this paper questions the geometrical aspects surrounding their design. It is well established {{that in the case}} of Robert Maillart’s designs, he relied on the logic of thrust lines, as was the case for masonry bridges that were provided by funicular polygons and graphic statics. Maillart also relied on trial sketches to define the mechanical features of successive sections of the bridge and on geometrical considerations to define the line of his bridges. In the case of his stiffened arch bridges, geometrical considerations were confined to following with almost regular thickness the trajectory of the thrust line. However, for some of them and for the whole family of three-hinged arch bridges, formal and geometrical considerations applied, for which some rules are presented here, and their evolution can be seen over time. The challenge in the geometrical organization of concrete around the thrust line is to equilibrate the stresses and manage the group of possible thrust lines depending on various loading cases. A well-designed concrete geometry avoids tensile stresses, which guarantees relatively long-lasting structures. With Maillart’s approach, an almost completely geometrical approach to design is encountered, since forces are also managed by geometry within the scope of graphic statics. Regular geometries and isostatic and symmetrical structures guarantee the possibility of undertaking a complete analysis using graphical approaches. However, when hyperstaticity or lateral forces are taken into account, the analysis is not as straightforward. This paper examines the extent to which the geometrical approach provides answers to these issues, with various hypotheses such as elastic analysis or a plastic lower-bound approach. The paper concludes by questioning this approach to the design of concrete structures in the early 20 th century and its relative interest for structural design today...|$|E

On the basis of this relative sufficiency measure, several alternative scalar- and vector-valued IMs are compared in terms of the expected difference in information they provide about a predicted structural response parameter, namely, the seismically induced drift in an existing <b>reinforced-concrete</b> frame <b>structure.</b> It is concluded that the most informative of the eight considered IMs for predicting the nonlinear drift response are two scalar IMs and a vector IM that depend only on the spectral ordinates at the periods of the first two (small-amplitude) modes of vibratio...|$|R
40|$|Fiber-reinforced-polymer (FRP) {{composite}} materials applied {{according to the}} near-surface-mounted (NSM) technique are very effective for the flexural strengthening of <b>reinforced-concrete</b> (RC) <b>structures.</b> However, the flexural strengthening effectiveness of this NSM technique is sometimes compromised by end concrete cover separation (CCS) failure, which is a premature failure before occurring the conventional flexural failure modes. Due {{to the complexity of}} this failure mode, no analytical approach, with a design framework for its accurate prediction, was published despite the available experimental results on this premature failure. In the present study, a novel simplified analytical approach is developed based on a closed form solution for an almost accurate prediction of CCS failure in RC structures strengthened in flexure with NSM FRP reinforcement. After demonstrating the good predictive performance of the proposed model, it was used for executing parametric studies in order to evaluate the influence of the material properties and FRP strengthening configuration on the susceptibility of occurring the CCS failure. At the end, regarding to the FRP strengthening configuration, some design recommendations were proposed to maximize the resistance of NSM FRP strengthened structures to the susceptibility of occurring the CCS failure.
