40|$|Background: Effective {{teamwork}} {{and communication}} among healthcare professionals {{are essential to}} ensure quality patient care and safety. The use of high-fidelity human patient simulation scenarios enhances learning and {{has been used in}} various health professions education. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy and retention of teaching team-based competencies to interprofessional student teams using high-fidelity simulation. Methods: Quasi-experimental, pre/post-test design was used. The study was a teaching intervention using high-fidelity human patient simulation with crisis resource management techniques to teach team based competencies. A convenience sample of students from medicine, nurse anesthesia, undergraduate nursing, and physical therapy participated. There were pre/post data collected for fall and spring simulations from both participants and observers. Key variables were the various teamwork competencies. Participants and trained observers rated teamwork behaviors, each using two measures. Mean scores on participant and observer rated tools were compared using paired samples t -tests. Results: A total of 35 students underwent training in the fall of 2009 and 25 of the students returned in the spring of 2010 for <b>repeat</b> <b>training.</b> Participant paired samples t -tests showed a significant increase from simulation scenario one to two (p Conclusions: High-fidelity simulation appears to improve both perceived and actual team-based competencies with retention over time.

40|$|Abstract. In our {{previous}} work {{we have discussed}} the training method of a support vector classifier by active set training allowing the solution to be infeasible during training. In this paper, we extend this method to training a support vector regressor (SVR). We use the dual form of the SVR where variables take real values and in the objective function the weighted linear sum of absolute values of the variables is included. We allow the variables to change signs from one step to the next. This means changes of the active inequality constraints. Namely, we solve the quadratic programming problem for the initial working set of training data by Newton’s method, delete from the working set the data within the epsilon tube, add to the working set training data outside of the epsilon tube, and <b>repeat</b> <b>training</b> the SVM until the working set does not change.

This way, not only the multiple solution complication due to nonlinearity of the log-likelihood function can be avoided, but also the need for lengthy adaptive iterations is obviated. Thus, the entire process becomes much simpler and faster. Most important, our estimator performance outperforms those of the existing ML techniques. However, it is to be noted that the advantages and superiority of our technique are achieved at the expense of data transfer rate reduction due to the use of <b>repeated</b> <b>training</b> blocks.|$|R

They proposed two mechanisms for this phenomenon. First, runners naturally acquire an optimal stride length and stride rate over time, based on perceived exertion [91], which supports the premises put forth previously [91, 162, 164].

Limited rehabilitation has been performed in this regard, owing to lack of specific knowledge {{on the part of}} medical staff. To establish an effective support program for stroke patients who wish to resume driving, we propose comprehensive training by medical staff using a driving simulator. Methods: A survey of stroke patients admitted to the Tokyo Metropolitan Rehabilitation Hospital was first performed. A questionnaire was sent to 525 patients. Of 218 responses, the answers of 118 patients who had been driving before their stroke were analyzed. More than 80 % of stroke patients did not obtain enough information about resuming driving during their hospital stay, and 38. 1 % of patients {{would have liked to have}} had driving training with a simulator. From these results, we set out to determine the effect of driving training using a realistic and technically advanced driving simulator. Twenty-four stroke patients and 20 healthy controls were included in the study. Results: <b>Repeat</b> <b>training</b> with the simulator resulted in an increased ability to perform braking and an improvement in driving ability. The majority of stroke patients who had the mental and physical ability to drive a car were likely to be assessed as being able to resume driving as a result of the training program. Conclusion: This study indicates that comprehensive support by medical staff and provision of adequate information about resumption of driving and the opportunity for training on a driving simulator are likely to aid resumption of driving by stroke patients, thus enhancing their rehabilitation and social reintegration.

40|$|Based on {{experiences}} of a traffic flow performance meter this papersuggests and evaluates cluster sampling and systematic sampling as methods toestimate average packet delays. Systematic sampling facilitates for exampletime analysis, frequency analysis and jitter measurements. Cluster samplingwith <b>repeated</b> <b>trains</b> of periodically spaced sampling units separated by randomstarting periods, and systematic sampling are evaluated {{with respect to}} accuracyand precision. Packet delay traces {{have been used in}} simulation studies. The motivation for this kind of cluster sampling is to avoid performance deteriorationdue to possible periodic patterns in packet delays. The conclusion ofthis study is that systematic sampling and cluster sampling methods are efficientalternatives, or complements, to simple random sampling. QC 20160225 </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Unlike other diseases, the {{management}} of sepsis has not been fully integrated in our daily practice. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether <b>repeated</b> <b>training</b> could improve compliance with a 6 -h resuscitation bundle in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. METHODS: Repeated education regarding a sepsis bundle was provided to the intensive care unit and emergency department residents, nurses, and faculties in a single university hospital. The educational program was led by a multidisciplinary team. A total of 175 adult patients with severe sepsis or septic shock were identified (88 before and 87 after the educational program). Hemodynamic resuscitation bundle and timely antibiotics administration were measured for all cases and mortality at 28 days after sepsis diagnosis was evaluated. RESULTS: The compliance rate for the sepsis resuscitation bundle before the educational program was poor (0 %), and <b>repeated</b> <b>training</b> improved it to 80 % (p &lt; 0. 001). The 28 -day mortality was significantly lower in the intervention group (16 % vs. 32 %, p = 0. 040). Within the intervention group, patients for whom the resuscitation bundle was successfully completed had a significantly lower 28 -day mortality than other patients (11 % vs. 41 %, p = 0. 004). CONCLUSIONS: Repeated education led by a multidisciplinary team and interdisciplinary communication improved the compliance rate of the 6 -h resuscitation bundle in severe sepsis and septic shock patients. Compliance with the sepsis resuscitation bundle was associated with improved 28 -day mortality in the study population...|$|R
40|$|Discrete element {{simulation}} {{provides some}} insight into the alteration of railway ballast after <b>repeated</b> <b>train</b> passings. The present Part 1 is devoted to a 2 D model of this granular layer interposed between the deformable ground and the rail sleeper, to which a large number of loading cycles is applied. Ballast grains are modelled as indeformable polygonal solids. A detailed account of the application to this frictional dynamical problem of the Non-Smooth Contact Dyna- mics numerical method is given. Validation is obtained through comparison with physical experiments performed on assemblies of prismatic mineral grains. Numerical results on the settlement of a track submitted to 20, 000 loading cycles or more are presented...|$|R
