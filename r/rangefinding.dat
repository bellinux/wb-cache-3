5|$|Recognizing the {{practicality}} of this solution, Admiral Rodman {{requested that}} the Navy Department send another battleship to operate with his division. Specifically, Rodman requested the ship be New Yorks sister ship , to better match Grand Fleet policy, which encouraged the use of matched pairs to aid in <b>rangefinding.</b> Although there was some grumbling at the Navy Department that a five ship division was counter to U.S. Navy policy, they eventually agreed, and on 11 February 1918, Texas arrived at Scapa Flow.|$|E

25|$|Another part of {{the strong}} {{equivalence}} principle is the requirement that Newton's gravitational constant be constant in time, and have the same value everywhere in the universe. There are many independent observations limiting the possible variation of Newton's gravitational constant, {{but one of the}} best comes from lunar <b>rangefinding</b> which suggests that the gravitational constant does not change by more than one part in 1011 per year. The constancy of the other constants is discussed in the Einstein equivalence principle section of the equivalence principle article.|$|E
25|$|A {{version of}} the {{equivalence}} principle, called the strong equivalence principle, asserts that self-gravitation falling bodies, such as stars, planets or black holes (which are all held together by their gravitational attraction) should follow the same trajectories in a gravitational field, provided the same conditions are satisfied. This is called the Nordtvedt effect and is most precisely tested by the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment. Since 1969, it has continuously measured the distance from several <b>rangefinding</b> stations on Earth to reflectors on the Moon to approximately centimeter accuracy. These have provided a strong constraint on several of the other post-Newtonian parameters.|$|E
500|$|In 1923, the Navy {{decided to}} send Rivadavia to the United States to be modernized. The ship {{departed}} on 6 August 1924 and reached Boston on the 30th, where it {{spent the next two}} years. Rivadavia was converted to use fuel oil instead of coal and had [...] "a general machinery overhaul". A new fire-control system was fitted with rangefinders on the fore and aft superfiring turrets, and the aft mast was replaced by a tripod. A funnel cap was installed so that smoke from the funnels did not interfere with accurate <b>rangefinding</b> of enemy ships. The 6-inch secondary armament was retained, but the smaller 4-inch guns were taken off in favor of four [...] anti-aircraft guns and four 3-pounders.|$|E

Some of the BL-109A mounts were to fitted for range-finding radars, probably Shtag-B (NATO designation Egg Cup), but they were ordinarily controlled by three SPN-500 directors, one for each pair of gun mounts. [...] The SPN-500s carried a [...] rangefinder as well as Yakor (NATO designation Sun Visor) fire-control radar.

500|$|X1 carried four QF 5.2 inch Mk I guns in twin {{unarmoured}} turrets, one {{forward and}} one aft of the conning tower.

A working chamber which was [...] in diameter encircled the trunk between the pressure hull and the gun mount. Her ammunition hoists were problematic and could not sustain the desired rate of fire of six rounds per gun per minute. Special ballast tanks were used {{to compensate for the}} loss of weight as ammunition was fired. Working and control of the guns required no less than 58 men. The fire-control tower {{was in the middle of}} the conning tower and had a top section that could be raised [...] when in use. The upper control room was between the tower and the pressure hull.

500|$|She entered {{service with}} the French Mediterranean Fleet in 1932. Pluton {{experienced}} many teething problems, {{particularly with the}} machinery. Shortly after she was commissioned the Navy decided to give her an extra role as a gunnery training ship and she entered Toulon Dockyard for the necessary modifications on 24 October 1932. Quarters for 40 men were added on the mine deck. Most of the 37-mm AA guns {{and all of the}} 8mm machine guns were replaced by four 50-caliber 75mm Canon de 75mm Mle 22 or 24 AA guns and 12 [...] Hotchkiss machine guns on six twin mounts, two mounts where the 37mm guns had been mounted on the foredeck and four between the funnels. The 75mm guns had a maximum depression of 10° and a maximum elevation of 90°. They fired a [...] shell at a muzzle velocity of [...] at a rate of fire of 8–18 rounds per minute and had a maximum effective ceiling of [...] The Hotchkiss guns had a cyclic rate of fire of 450 rounds per minute, but the practical rate was between 200 and 250 rounds per minute to allow for reloading its 30-round magazines. They had a theoretical ceiling of [...] A simple fire-control director was added for the 138mm guns and 15 additional rangefinders were installed for use by the <b>Rangefinding</b> School.|$|E

2500|$|The Allied cruiser {{group was}} {{spread out in}} front of Warspite and at 15:15 they caught sight of the Italian main battle force and the two groups opened fire at [...] Italian <b>rangefinding</b> was better than the Allied, and within three minutes they had found the {{distance}} even though they were firing at extreme range. Although the Allies' <b>rangefinding</b> was not as good and they had trouble with their rounds falling short, the Allied gunlaying was better {{and they were able to}} place their rounds in much tighter groups. Generally the gunnery of the two forces was fairly well matched. After only a few minutes the range was down to [...] and the Allied guns became useful. However, by 15:22, the Italian fire came dangerously close to the Allied cruisers and Vice Admiral John Tovey decided to disengage. At this point splinters from a [...] shell fired by the cruiser [...] hit , damaging her catapult and the reconnaissance aircraft beyond repair. The cruisers continued to open the range and by 15:30 fire ceased.|$|E
2500|$|Otama {{was laid}} down by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at Greenock, Scotland on 25 May 1973, {{launched}} on 3 December 1975, and commissioned into the RAN on 27 April 1978. The submarine was due to enter service in 1976, but faulty high-power electrical cabling had been installed in Otama and sister boat stripping out and replacing the cabling delayed each submarine's construction by two years. The delay meant that the two boats could be fitted with Micropuffs <b>rangefinding</b> sonar during construction that the earlier built boats were due to receive as an upgrade.|$|E
2500|$|The Italian {{commander}} {{decided to}} take on Warspite, and started moving his two battleships into position. At 15:52 Giulio Cesare opened fire at a range of [...] Conte di Cavour did not fire, a decision many have questioned. Italian strategy was to have only one ship targeted at a time, as it was learned during the Battle of Jutland that {{with more than one}} ship firing at a single target it became very difficult for the <b>rangefinding</b> parties to tell which rounds were theirs. Conte di Cavour had been assigned to Malaya and Royal Sovereign, which were further back and did not enter the engagement.|$|E

HMS Gloucester fired three salvos in return. These fell short but did cause the Italians to make a course change.|$|E

50|$|Stadiametric <b>rangefinding,</b> or the stadia {{method is}} a {{technique}} of measuring distances with a telescopic instrument. The term stadia comes from a Greek unit of length Stadion (equal to 600 Greek feet, pous) which was the typical length of a sports stadium of the time. Stadiametric <b>rangefinding</b> is used for surveying and in the telescopic sights of firearms, artillery pieces, or tank guns, {{as well as some}} binoculars and other optics. It is still widely used in long-range military sniping, but in many professional applications it is being replaced with microwave, infrared, or laser <b>rangefinding</b> methods. Although much easier to use, electronic rangefinders can give away the shooter's position to a well-equipped adversary, and the need for accurate range estimation existed for much longer than electronic rangefinders small and rugged enough to be suitable for military use.|$|E
