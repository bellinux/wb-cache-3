50|$|The Main Street of Kilwinning has {{recently}} been refurbished {{as part of the}} regeneration of the Irvine Bay area by Irvine <b>Bay</b> <b>Regeneration</b> Company.|$|R
50|$|Kilwinning Academy S2 Art and Design {{pupils in}} 2010/11 helped Irvine <b>Bay</b> <b>Regeneration</b> {{in their efforts}} to {{refurbish}} Kilwinning's town centre by creating tiles for a mural for a tunnel leading from the shops and Abbey to the car park.|$|R
50|$|The {{refurbishment}} of Kilwinning Main Street in 2010 by Irvine <b>Bay</b> <b>Regeneration</b> Company led to {{a number}} of new businesses opening shops in the town centre. The project is {{one of a number of}} regeneration projects in the Irvine Bay area.|$|R
50|$|Offshore is the Horse Isle, an RSPB {{reserve and}} home to nationally {{important}} populations of herring gulls and lesser black backed gulls. The Holm Plantation dividing Ardrossan and Saltcoats is a popular area for walks. Irvine <b>Bay</b> <b>Regeneration</b> {{has led to the}} plantation receiving many amenities such as lighting and landscaped flower areas.|$|R
50|$|Mermaid Quay was at {{the centre}} of the <b>regeneration</b> of the <b>Bay</b> by the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation (CBDC). Part of the British Government’s Urban Development Programme to {{regenerate}} deprived and run-down inner city areas. The CBDC was set up in April 1987 to regenerate 1,100 hectares of derelict docklands of Cardiff and Penarth - once the world's largest coal exporting port - to create Europe’s largest waterfront development.|$|R
40|$|This booklet {{reflects}} {{the outcomes of}} a Masters in Architecture design unit exploration of the condition of and possible futures for the Coal Exchange in Cardiff Bay. It focussed {{on the theme of}} resilience, considering questions of potential adaptability in the light of Cardiff's post-industrial economy, effects of the recent economic crisis, the redevelopment emphasis of <b>regeneration</b> in Cardiff <b>Bay</b> over the past thirty years and the changing status of industrial heritage...|$|R
5000|$|An {{evaluation}} of the <b>regeneration</b> of Cardiff <b>Bay</b> published in 2004 concluded that the project had [...] "reinforced the competitive position of Cardiff" [...] and [...] "contributed to a massive improvement {{in the quality of}} the built environment". However, the regeneration project had been less successful in generating employment. The evaluation concluded that [...] "the overall outcome, while representing a major achievement and massive step forward, falls short of the original vision." ...|$|R
50|$|Mermaid Quay was {{designed}} by architects Benoy and opened in August 1999. Since that time there has been vast <b>regeneration</b> of the <b>Bay</b> including the construction of Lloyd George Avenue - a new link road between the city centre and the Bay - numerous iconic buildings, and residential and commercial developments including Mermaid Quay. Cardiff Bay {{is now one of}} the top destinations in Wales attracting a range of visitors from South Wales day-trippers to tourists from around the globe.|$|R
5000|$|A {{thriving}} {{sea urchin}} fishery operated in Dunmanus Bay, {{in the area}} bounded by Mannion's Island Ahakista and the ruined Dunmanus Castle. The waters are shallow and this encouraged urchin growth. The fishery was operated by Paudie McSwiney, John, Patrick and Joe Arthur of Kenmare Saw Mills and John and Dermot Murphy of Bantry. The boatmen were Joe and Mick Flynn of Gearameen Durrus. The Lucey family of Waterville and a French Company operating out of Crookhaven were also in the business. At different stages four or five boats operated. The urchins were picked from the seabed by divers. John Arthur {{said that they would}} often spend four hours in the water. The urchins were sold on the French market live and were shipped through Cork Airport. The fishery was effectively wiped out with the sudden onset of red tide in the early eighties and by overharvesting, preventing <b>regeneration.</b> Kenmare <b>Bay</b> suffered a similar fate and urchin [...] "fishing" [...] is now unheard of in these bays.|$|R
2500|$|The East Moors Steelworks {{closed in}} 1978 and Cardiff lost {{population}} during the 1980s, {{consistent with a}} wider pattern of counter urbanisation in Britain. However, it recovered {{and was one of}} the few cities (outside London) where population grew during the 1990s. During this period the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was promoting the redevelopment of south Cardiff; an evaluation of the <b>regeneration</b> of Cardiff <b>Bay</b> published in 2004 concluded that the project had [...] "reinforced the competitive position of Cardiff" [...] and [...] "contributed to a massive improvement in the quality of the built environment", although it had failed [...] "to attract the major inward investors originally anticipated".|$|R
25|$|Other major {{tourist attractions}} are the Cardiff <b>Bay</b> <b>regeneration</b> sites {{which include the}} {{recently}} opened Wales Millennium Centre and the Senedd, and many other cultural and sites of interest including the Cardiff Bay Barrage and the famous Coal Exchange. The New Theatre was founded in 1906 and completely refurbished in the 1980s. Until {{the opening of the}} Wales Millennium Centre in 2004, it was the premier venue in Wales for touring theatre and dance companies. Other venues which are popular for concerts and sporting events include Motorpoint Arena, St David's Hall and the Principality Stadium. Cardiff Story, a museum documenting the city's history, has been open to the public since spring 2011.|$|R
5000|$|The Irvine <b>Bay</b> <b>Re{{generation}}</b> Company {{was set up}} in 2006, one of {{the second}} generation of Scottish URCs. Irvine is one of the five towns in the area, along with Ardrossan, Saltcoats, Stevenston and Kilwinning. Major development projects in the Irvine area include the redevelopment of Irvine Harbour, creating a residential area with the atmosphere of a Scottish village. Planning for a new golf course with a hotel and holiday resort is also well under way in the Marine Drive area, and the Riverside Business Park will be revitalised to attract new business into the area. The Bridgegate renovation project is now nearing completion(only the old Trinity church is left to complete), ...|$|R
50|$|Since 2006 Ardrossan {{has been}} part of a {{regeneration}} area, overseen by the Irvine <b>Bay</b> <b>Regeneration</b> Company. Its vision for Ardrossan is as a gateway to Arran and good place to live and relax next to the sea in a regenerated town centre serving the existing and incoming community. It has started to be achieved through renewal of the town centre, which includes a derelict office in Princes Street which has been turned into two modern shops. The former Jack Miller's Hotel building at 78 Princes Street an(ex Posthouse for changing horses in the 1800s), was refurbished in autumn 2010 and has been home to several businesses and including an art gallery and artists studio space called Phoenix, and a graphic design studio. The old pumphouse has been transformed into an Italian restaurant. In 2014 work started on new office accommodation beside the marina, with works due to be completed in summer 2015. The North Shore project includes the redevelopment of the oil refinery site and the extension of the marina.|$|R
40|$|Clearance, ingestion, {{and growth}} rates of two coastal tintinnid ciliates were {{measured}} in batch culture {{as a function of}} temperature and phytoplankton concentration. Oxygen consumption and ammonium excretion rates were determined at food concentrations which supported maximum growth rates at each temperature. Clearance, ingestion, respiration, excretion, and {{growth rates of}} both species increased with temperature. Clearing rates declined with increasing phytoplankton abundance. Ingestion and growth rates increased asymptotically with phytoplankton abundance and declined at high food concentrations. Gross growth efficiency was highest at phytoplankton concentrations which supported maximum growth rates. Over a range of temperatures, respiration and excretion were linearly related and exhibited significant linear relationships with ingestion and curvilinear relationships with growth. 0 : N ratios were 4 - 7, assuming an RQ of 1. O. The metabolic data were combined with previous measurements of in situ production by tintinnids to estimate their potential carbon requirements and NH,+ <b>regeneration</b> in Narragansett <b>Bay,</b> Rhode Island. Tintinnids ingested a carbon equivalent of 16 - 26 % of the total annual net primary production and 32 - 52 % of < IO-urn nanonlankton oroduction.
