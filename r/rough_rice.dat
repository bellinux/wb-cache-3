2500|$|The first policy, called [...] "denial of rice", {{was carried}} out in three {{southern}} districts along the coast of the Bay of Bengal that were expected to have surpluses of rice– Bakarganj (or Barisal), Midnapore and Khulna. In late March 1942, Governor Herbert, acting under orders from the UK, issued a directive requiring surplus stocks of paddy (<b>rough,</b> unhusked <b>rice)</b> and other food items to be removed or destroyed in three districts. Great urgency was attached to the task; the Governor instructed various agents to do it almost immediately. Some rice was apparently simply destroyed, but paddy was also purchased by government agents in coastal districts and stored in various locations. Official figures for the amounts of rice and paddy impounded were relatively small; reductions of this level would inflict only limited damage, reducing local peasants' access to rice and contributing to local scarcities in an already perilous period. Evidence that fraud, corruption and coercive practices by the purchasing agents drained far more rice from the market than officially recorded, not only in the three designated districts, but also in unauthorised areas, suggests that the impact may have been greater. Far more damaging, finally, was the policy's disturbing impact on regional market relationships and contribution to a sense of confusion and public alarm.|$|R

Using modeling techniques to simulate in-bin <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> drying in typically-encountered field scenarios may provide a tool for rapidly predicting the grain condition as drying progresses. The objectives {{for this study were}} to (1) investigate accurate models for predicting equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> at set conditions of air temperature and relative humidity (RH), (2) develop and validate a mathematical model for predicting moisture content (MC) and temperature profiles of <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> during NA, in-bin drying, and (3) perform computer simulations using the developed mathematical model to determine the impacts of drying strategy (<b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> initial MC, drying-start date, air flowrate, and fan control strategy) on <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> drying duration, maximum dry matter loss, and percent overdrying. In order to accomplish objective (1), adsorption and desorption isotherms of long-grain hybrid <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> at temperatures ranging from 15 °C to 35 °C and RHs of 10 % to 90 % were determined by using a Dynamic Vapor Sorption analysis device.

To achieve objective (2), Post-Harvest Aeration Simulation Tool - Finite Difference Method, developed by Bartosik and Maier (2004), was modified for rice and used to simulate in-bin <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> drying in Arkansas. Simulation results were validated by field experiments, which used modern, on-farm bins equipped with “cabling and sensing technology” for in-bin RH and <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> temperature measurement; the <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> MC was calculated based on the measured RH and temperature data.

A twenty-year weather data set (1995 to 2014) of ambient air temperature and RH of the U. S.

DRC- 1339 blackbird baiting programs probably will continue until available alternative control techniques (i. e., repellents) become available. We conducted 3 studies to evaluate different rice baits and chemicals to improve efficacy of DRC- 1339 for use at staging areas. During the first study, individually caged red-winged blackbirds preferred untreated medium grain brown rice over long grain brown rice, <b>rough</b> <b>rice,</b> or <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> soaked with sodium bisulfite.

40|$|Effect of germinated rice {{media on}} growth of {{probiotic}} bacteria including Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. pentosus, L. plantarum and L. fermentum were studied. Germinated <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> powder {{was obtained by}} allowing rice grains to germinate in water with hulls at 80 % relative humidity and 30 °C for 48 h. The germinated rice grains were dried, dehulled and powdered with a laboratory hamper mill. The powder (5 % w/w) was well-mixed with water to prepare the growth medium for the probiotic bacteria strains. This was compared with medium with regular rice powder. NaCl (2 %w/w) was also added to study the bacteria growth. Chemical analysis including vitamins B (thiamin, niacin and pyridoxine), reducing sugar and total protein contents in rice, brown rice and germinated <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> were determined. Germination of rice grains increased many nutrients. Vitamins B, reducing sugar and total protein contents of germinated <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> were higher (p< 0. 05) than those of brown rice and rice, respectively. Addition of NaCl lowered the growth of probiotic bacteria. L. plantarum exhibited the highest (p< 0. 05) growth in medium containing germinated <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> powder with and without NaCl {{compared to the other}} strains. The results from this present study suggested that germinated <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> {{can be used as a}} supplement for L. plantarum in food fermentation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. After harvest, most <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> {{research}} {{samples are}} dried using ambient air, {{the temperature and}} relative humidity of which oscillates. Fluctuations in environmental conditions produce variation in the final moisture contents (MCs) of samples, yielding inconsistent functional properties. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop an alternative method for drying small <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> samples using silica gel that would be capable of yielding accurate and precise final MCs while maintaining grain quality. Drying experiments incorporated a combination of 1 ‐ and 5 ‐g moisture‐permeable packets of silica gel, mixed with <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> samples in plastic bags. The average adsorptive capacity of the packets in closed <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> samples was established as 25 % to 27 % (i. e., 0. 25 ‐ to 0. 27 ‐g water / 1 ‐g silica gel). A desired final MC (12. 5 %) was achieved for silica‐gel‐dried rice samples within four to five days, and the milling quality of samples dried to 12. 5 % MC, expressed as head rice yield, was not significantly different from that of control‐dried samples...|$|E
40|$|Rapid water {{adsorption}} by mature, low-moisture content (MC) rice kernels {{can have}} detrimental effects on milling quality due to kernel fissuring. Recent reports of milling quality reductions in field samples of newly released varieties have prompted {{the need to}} determine critical MC levels below which rapid moisture addition will cause fissuring. This study investigated how water-soaking {{as a means of}} simulating field moisture-adsorption affects the incidence of fissuring and milling quality, specifically HRY. Results showed that milling quality of water-soaked <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> was affected by <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> initial MC (IMC) and soaking temperature. For all varieties, the percentage of fissured kernels increased with a decrease in <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> IMC and a decrease in water temperature. Consequently, HRY decreased as <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> IMC decreased. Among variet-ies, ‘Francis ’ had lower HRYs and higher percentages of fissured kernels than ‘Bengal’ and ‘Wells ’ at a given soaking treatment combination. The results of this study will be helpful in understanding kernel fissuring susceptibility and resultant milling quality reduction for rice subjected to water adsorption...|$|E
40|$|Fissured rice kernels break during milling, {{leading to}} head rice yield (HRY) reductions. Conventional fissure {{detection}} instruments {{cannot be used}} to observe fissures in <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> kernels, the form in which rice in normally dried and stored. X-rays can penetrate hulls allowing visualization of the internal structure of a <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> kernel. This study evaluated the capability of X-ray imaging to adequately detect fissures in <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> and established a correlation between HRY and the fissured kernel percentage (FKP) in a <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> sample. Fifteen long-grain rice cultivars, harvested in Arkansas in 2015 and 2016 were dried using heated air at 60 ºC, 10 % relative humidity (RH) for various combinations of drying durations and post-drying treatments that resulted in varying degrees of fissuring and HRYs. Fissure detection was conducted using an X-ray system with <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> and {{compared to that of}} a grainscope, a conventional fissure detection instrument, with brown rice. A strong correlation (R^ 2 = 0. 95) was shown to exist between sample HRY and the FKP of the <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> sample after drying, resulting in a regression equation {{that could be used to}} estimate HRY. Having confirmed the impact of fissured kernels on HRY, the X-ray system, with an augmented drying apparatus, was used to evaluate the impact of kernel thickness and moisture content (MC) on rice fissuring. Two long-grain rice cultivars were harvested in Arkansas in 2016, each at two MC levels (high and low), and fractionated into three thickness fraction sub-lots (thin, medium, and thick). The fissuring susceptibility of kernels from each sub-lot was evaluated during drying. Generally, with increase in kernel thickness, the FKP increased for high-MC lots. In regards to MC, high-MC had greater FKPs than the low-MC lots. Overall, these findings show the importance of kernel fissuring to the rice industry, and highlights the role of kernel properties on fissuring during drying...|$|E
40|$|Moisture {{adsorption}} of {{long-grain rice}} was modeled using the finite element method. The <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> kernel {{was considered a}} prolate spheroid comprised of three homogeneous components: endosperm, bran, and hull. Adsorption tests were conducted on white, brown, and <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> of the 'Newbonnet ' and 'Lemont ' varieties at temperatures ranging from 12 ° C to 50 ° C. Diffusivity values were determined for each rice component and each rice form (i. e., rough, brown, and white rice) using a finite element program with an optimization subroutine. White rice had the highest adsorption rate and <b>rough</b> <b>rice</b> the lowest. Endosperm had considerably higher diffusivity values than the bran and hull. The diffusivities of 'Lemont' rice components {{were found to be}} more temperature dependent than those of 'Newbonnet'. The diffusivity temperature-dependency for each rice component and form was described by an Arrhenius-type function...|$|E
