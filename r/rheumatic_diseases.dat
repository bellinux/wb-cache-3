The Paragon was {{designed}} by Thomas Warr Attwood. Each building has matching doors and windows with central pediments and flat entablatures either side of the 1st floor windows and Tuscan pilasters and pediments to the doorways. Numbers 22 to 37 continue the theme from numbers 1 to 21 and were completed in 1775 by Joseph Axford, a local mason. Numbers 28 to 32 were damaged by bombing during World War II but have since been restored.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{have been}} used medicinally in {{cultures}} around the world, often according to the Doctrine of Signatures. Thus, the femurs of grasshoppers, which were said to resemble the human liver, were used to treat liver ailments by the indigenous peoples of Mexico. The doctrine was applied in both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and in Ayurveda. TCM uses arthropods for various purposes; for example, centipede is used to treat tetanus, seizures, and convulsions, while the Chinese Black Mountain Ant, Polyrhachis vicina, {{is used as a}} cure all, especially by the elderly, and extracts have been examined as a possible anti-cancer agent. Ayurveda uses insects such as Termite for conditions such as ulcers, <b>rheumatic</b> <b>diseases,</b> anaemia, and pain. The Jatropha leaf miner's larvae are used boiled to induce lactation, reduce fever, and soothe the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, the traditional insect medicine of Africa is local and unformalised. The indigenous peoples of Central America used a wide variety of insects medicinally. Mayans used Army ant soldiers as living sutures. The venom of the Red harvester ant was used to cure rheumatism, arthritis, and poliomyelitis via the immune reaction produced by its sting. Boiled silkworm pupae were taken to treat apoplexy, aphasy, bronchitis, pneumonia, convulsions, haemorrhages, and frequent urination.|$|E

In addition to scleroderma, these antibodies are found in approximately 5% of individuals with SLE. The antigenic target of anti-Scl-70 antibodies is topoisomerase I.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Chronic {{conditions}} {{can lead to}} considerable dete-rioration in functioning. Several condition-specific Core Sets, selections of categories from the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), have been de-veloped to facilitate the rehabilitation process. Considering the increase in patients {{with more than one}} specific condi-tion, we evaluated the impact of multimorbidity on function-ing and the implications for the Core Set approach. Design: Internet survey. Subjects: A total of 127 people with a <b>rheumatic</b> <b>disease</b> and 707 people with <b>rheumatic</b> <b>disease</b> and multimorbidity were included. Methods: Self-report information on chronic conditions and perceived functioning using the IMPACT-S (ICF Measure of Participitation and Activities Screener) questionnaire, measuring the ICF component activities and participation (32 items). Results: The mean number of reported serious limitations/re-strictions was 5. 6 (standard deviation (SD) 5. 7) for respond-ents with <b>rheumatic</b> <b>disease</b> and 6. 7 (SD 6. 8) for respondents with <b>rheumatic</b> <b>disease</b> and multimorbidity (p < 0. 05). Sev-enteen items were relevant (more than 20 % of the respond-ents reported serious limitations/restrictions) for individuals with <b>rheumatic</b> <b>disease</b> and multimorbidity, and 12 items were relevant for individuals with <b>rheumatic</b> <b>disease</b> only. Conclusion: Multimorbidity seriously aggravates the al-ready existing functioning problems of people with rheumat-ic disease. We recommend that in the ICF Core Set approach more emphasis is given to systematic empirical analysis of the impact of multimorbidity on functioning.

25|$|Howard Andrew Knox (March 7, 1885 – July 27, 1949) was an American {{medical doctor}} specializing in heart and <b>rheumatic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Serving as an {{assistant}} surgeon at Ellis Island during the early 1900s, he made major contributions to intelligence testing through the methods he devised to screen immigrants for mental deficiencies... However, {{at the time of}} his death, he was most well known as a veteran, a general physician, and a contributing member of his community, and his contributions to intelligence testing had become largely forgotten. Although his work in this area has become largely overlooked, his contributions have served as an important link between early intelligence research and present day intelligence testing.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, {{also known}} as SS-A and SS-B, respectively, are {{commonly}} found in primary Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that affects the exocrine glands. The presence of both antibodies is found in 30–60% of Sjögren's syndrome, anti-Ro antibodies alone are found in 50–70% of Sjögren's syndrome and 30% of SLE with cutaneous involvement, and anti-La antibodies are rarely found in isolation. Anti-La antibodies are also found in SLE; however, Sjögren's syndrome is normally also present. Anti-Ro antibodies are also found less frequently in other disorders including autoimmune liver diseases, coeliac disease, autoimmune <b>rheumatic</b> <b>diseases,</b> cardiac neonatal lupus erythematosus and polymyositis. During pregnancy, anti-Ro antibodies can cross the placenta and cause neonatal lupus in babies. In Sjögren's syndrome, anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies correlate with early onset, increased disease duration, parotid gland enlargement, disease outside the glands and infiltration of glands by lymphocytes. Anti-Ro antibodies are specific to components of the Ro-RNP complex, comprising 45kDa, 52kDa, 54kDa and 60kDa proteins and RNA. The 60kDa DNA/RNA binding protein and 52kDa T-cell regulatory protein are the best characterised antigens of anti-Ro antibodies. Collectively, these proteins {{are part of a}} ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that associate with the hyRNAs, hY1-hY5. The La antigen is a 48kDa transcription termination factor of RNA polymerase III, which associates with the Ro-RNP complex.|$|E

The aim of the pilot study was to show differences in wound healing between RP and a control group without <b>rheumatic</b> <b>disease.</b> RP with different types of chronic <b>rheumatic</b> <b>disease</b> (like rheumatoid arthritis, connective tissue disease, spondyloarthropathy or vaskulitis) were interviewed for dental intervention (like tooth extraction, implantation or root planing), systemic disease, parodontal disease and oral hygiene with an acquired questionnaire. These facts were compared with the age and sex matched controls. We found 128 RP (96 women/ 75 %; 32 man/ 25 %) with mean time of <b>rheumatic</b> <b>disease</b> from 10 ± 9, 9 years and 128 age and sex matched patients in the control group. RP = 41 /controls = 57 report a good wound healing (p = 0, 002), RP = 12 /controls = 9 a moderate wound healing (p = 0, 480), RP = 5 /controls = 1 bad wound healing (p = 0, 096). RP = 9 /controls = 7 report a low (p = 0, 597), RP = 1 /controls = 1 a moderate, RP = 1 /controls = 0 a severe infection. These results detect differences in wound healing and risk factors in connection with dental intervention between RP and controls without <b>rheumatic</b> <b>disease.</b> Dental surgery is possible in RP, but prae- and postoperative surgery management must be careful attended.

Retinal vessel calibre was measured from fundus photographs, and summarised as the central retinal artery and vein equivalents (CRAE and CRVE) using a semi-automated computer-assisted method. RESULTS: The 124 patients studied had rheumatoid arthritis (n = 76, 61 %), systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 17, 14 %), psoriatic arthritis (n = 11, 9 %) or another rheumatological disease (n = 20, 16 %). Retinal venular calibre was increased in patients with autoimmune <b>rheumatic</b> <b>disease</b> (+ 11. 6 µm, 95 % Confidence interval [CI] 3. 8 - 19. 3, p = 0. 01) compared with other hospital patients, after adjusting for baseline differences. This increase was also present in the subgroup with rheumatoid arthritis (p = 0. 01). Patients with a <b>rheumatic</b> <b>disease</b> and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels had wider retinal venules than those with a lower CRP (mean CRVE: 247. 8 ± 28. 0 versus 216. 6 ± 25. 3, p < 0. 01), and than other hospital patients with increased CRP (mean CRVE: 247. 8 ± 28. 0 versus 216. 4 ± 25. 9, p < 0. 01).
