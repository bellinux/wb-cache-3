40|$|<b>Regression</b> <b>of</b> Hensen's <b>node</b> from {{anterior}} to posterior {{is driving the}} elongation and patterning of avian embryo body. Recent experiments link gradient of presomitic mesoderm cell motility to displacement <b>of</b> the <b>node</b> and body axis elongation. Ingression of new cells into presomitic mesoderm tissue also contributes to the process. At present, movements of presomitic mesoderm can be tracked at single cell precision. Yet, mechanisms that couple these movements to regression and axis elongation are largely unknown. In this work we develop a computational approach to study <b>regression</b> <b>of</b> Hensen's <b>node</b> and the elongation of anterior-posterior body axis. Based on our simulations we propose that regression and the elongation {{are a result of}} the influx of new mesoderm cells mediated by cell density gradient. Addition of new cells leads to expansion of tissue in anterior-posterior direction (elongation) and pushes node towards posterior (<b>regression).</b> Motility gradient <b>of</b> cells further aids regression by biasing tissue expansion towards more motile posterior. We show that our model reproduces experimentally observed differences in presomitic mesoderm cell movements and <b>regression</b> <b>of</b> Hensen's <b>node</b> in various embryo phenotypes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Just as the <b>regression</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nodes</b> <b>of</b> {{the lunar}} orbit is {{connected}} with the periodicity in the eclipse phenomenon, the advance of perigee {{is connected with}} the periodicity in the fluctuations of Moon's synodic period. From the data for 495 synodic months {{it is found that}} the gross fluctuation pattern repeats itself after about 112 synodic months, which is close to the period of one complete revolution of the Moon's perigee. Within each gross fluctuation pattern there are eight smaller cycles of about 14 synodic months. The causes of these features are suggested in terms of the angles between the new moon and the perigees of the Moon and the Sun. The dependence of the amplitude of variation with respect to various angular separations can possibly be understood {{by the fact that the}} tidal effect on the Moon varies with its relative distance from the Sun. 1...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} better early neuronal birth and differentiation in higher vertebrates, we {{have examined the}} time when presumptive neurons in the chick embryo first withdraw from the cell cycle and express neurofilaments. Hindbrain reticular neurons arise prior to the definitive streak stage of gastrulation and represent the first neuronal population to be born. The birth of hindbrain reticular neurons and spinal interneurons occurs in a rostrocaudal sequence that closely parallels <b>regression</b> <b>of</b> Hensen's <b>node.</b> More rostral brain stem neurons are born shortly after those in the hindbrain. Neurofilament expression in reticular neuroblasts first occurs by the 7 -somite stage, followed by axon outgrowth by the 15 -somite stage.

PATIENTS [...] Children aged 1 - 12 years with extensive, multiple site, superficial tuberculous lymphadenitis confirmed by biopsy (histopathology or culture). INTERVENTIONS [...] Patients were treated with a fully supervised intermittent chemotherapy regimen consisting of streptomycin, rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide {{three times a week}} for two months followed by streptomycin and isoniazid twice a week for four months on an outpatient basis. Surgery was limited to biopsy <b>of</b> <b>nodes</b> for diagnosis and assessment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Response to chemotherapy was assessed by <b>regression</b> <b>of</b> lymph <b>nodes</b> and healing <b>of</b> sinuses and abscesses during treatment and follow up. Compliance with treatment and frequency of adverse reactions were also estimated. RESULTS [...] 197 Patients were admitted to the study and 168 into the analysis. The regimen was well tolerated and compliance was good with 101 (60 %) patients receiving the prescribed chemotherapy within 15 days of the stipulated period of six months. Those whose chemotherapy extended beyond that period received the same total number of doses. Clinical response was favourable in most patients at the end of treatment. Sinuses and abscesses healed rapidly. Residual lymphadenopathy (exceeding 10 mm diameter) was present in 50 (30 %) patients at the end <b>of</b> treatment; these <b>nodes</b> were biopsied. Fresh nodes, increase in size <b>of</b> <b>nodes,</b> and sinuses and abscesses occurred both during treatment and follow up. After 36 months of follow up after treatment only 5 (3 %) patients required retreatment for tuberculosis.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} distributed least-mean square (LMS) algorithms for parameter estimation over sensor networks where the <b>regression</b> data <b>of</b> each <b>node</b> are corrupted by white measurement noise.

40|$|There is {{a demand}} for {{communications}} services at high latitudes that is not well served by conventional geostationary satellites. Alternatives using low-altitude orbits require too large constellations. Other options are the Molniya and Tundra families (critically-inclined, eccentric orbits with the apogee at high latitudes). In this work we have considered derivatives of the Tundra type with different inclinations and eccentricities. By means of a high-precision model of the terrestrial gravity field and the most relevant environmental perturbations, we have studied the evolution of these orbits {{during a period of}} two years. The effects of the different perturbations on the constellation ground track (which is more important for coverage than the orbital elements themselves) have been identified. We show that, {{in order to maintain the}} ground track unchanged, the most important parameters are the orbital period and the argument of the perigee. Very subtle changes in the orbital period (due mainly to lunar perturbations) cause a large east-west drift of the ground trace which dwarfs the displacement due to the <b>regression</b> <b>of</b> the ascending <b>node.</b> From these findings, a station-keeping strategy that minimizes propellant consumption has then been devised.

These cases were followed up for period of 22 months. Materials and Methods: Total 1521 tuberculous cases were screened in KIMS both pulmonary and extra pulmonary cases out of which 146 cases were tuberculous lymphadenitis. Fifty cases of tuberculous cervical lymphadenopathy were included after diagnostic and treatment algorithm and fine needle biopsy or excision biopsy. Patients below 5 yrs, immunocompromised, having diabetes mellitus, pulmonary tuberculosis and with other co-morbid conditions {{were excluded from the}} study. All patients were put on DOTS CAT III as per RNTCP guidelines. Follow-up was done every 2 months till 6 months for 1) Constitution symptoms 2) Weight gain or loss 3) Appetite gain or loss 4) <b>Regression</b> <b>of</b> lymph <b>nodes</b> or increase 5) Compliance 6) Side effects 7) Failures by demonstration of organism by direct smear, culture or histopathological examination. Results: In this study, lymph node regression was found in 78 % at the end of 2 months, 94 % at the end of 4 months and 96 % at the end of 6 months, 9 patients had regression in size though the nodes were palpable, 2 had no regression but fresh lymph nodes appeared on the same side and sinus discharge was present, culture was negative in these cases. Two cases had immune reconstitution syndrome, constitutional symptoms disappeared and showed clinical improvement. Four cases were subjected for surgical intervention. Conclusion: DOTS CAT III is effective in the treatment of tuberculous cervical lymphadenopathy. Compliance was good with minimal, minor side effects, only two had immune reconstitution syndrome and two had sinus formation; they were referred for surgical intervention, and follow-up of 22 months did not show any relapses...|$|R

By generalized literature data over 30 % of HIV-infec¬ted patients suffer from tuberculosis and about 30 – 40 % of patients die from tuberculosis [1]. Administration of anti-retroviral therapy (ARVT) du¬ring intensive phase of chemotherapy increases treatment results and pa¬tients’ survival rate [10]. Retrospective analysis of direct results of treatment of 104 patients with co-infection tuberculosis/HIV was carried out. All patients, enrolled in the investigation by methods of matching of pairs by form, prevalence of tuberculosis process and severity of HIV-infection were divided into groups: basic group (52 patients) with administered anti-retro¬viral therapy on the background of intensive chemotherapy phase and control group (52 patients), undergoing treatment with anti-tuberculosis agents only. As a result of investigation there may be drawn a conclusion that standard 5 -component chemotherapy regimens without ARVT usage have low efficacy – improvement is achieved in 61,% of patients; the rest of patients do not achieve significantly positive dynamics, either worsening of state or lethal outcomes are observed. Аnti-retroviral therapy increases treatment efficacy both in stopping of bacteria-excretion (by 2 times) and by summative treat¬ment indices – resolution of infiltrative and focal changes in the lungs and <b>regression</b> <b>of</b> affected lymphatic <b>nodes</b> (by 27 %).

However, the impact of its expression on patient outcome and its association with tumour infiltrating inflammatory cells remain to be validated. We evaluated CCR 7 protein expression by immunohistochemistry in a large well characterized cohort (n[*]=[*] 866) of early invasive primary breast cancers. CCR 7 was expressed in the cytoplasm and membrane of tumour cells. We observed a weak positive association of high CCR 7 expression when in either cellular component, but not both together, with axillary lymph node stage 3 tumours (p[*]=[*] 0. 043). Logistic <b>regression</b> analysis <b>of</b> lymph <b>node</b> stage revealed no independent predictive value for CCR 7 expression.

CCR 7 staining was negatively associated with CD 3 + cells. There was no significant association of CCR 7 expression with breast cancer recurrence or survival. We conclude that while CCR 7 is not a useful biomarker for predicting lymph node metastasis, it may reflect altered intra- and inter-cellular signalling related to the immune microenvironment.
