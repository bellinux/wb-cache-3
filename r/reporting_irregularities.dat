40|$|Abstract: Using {{organizational}} strategy theory (Miles and Snow 1978, 2003), we analyze whether auditors differentially price {{their clients}} ‟ business strategies. We also investigate whether certain business strategies are inherently riskier by examining {{their association with}} financial <b>reporting</b> <b>irregularities.</b> Based on Ittner, Larker and Rajan (1997) and Miles and Snow (1978, 2003), we form a composite business strategy measure comprised of six firm-level components from publicly available data. We find that innovative Prospector strategies {{are associated with a}} greater likelihood of financial <b>reporting</b> <b>irregularities</b> and that audit fees are higher for such clients. Our findings suggest that business strategy is a separate construct with incremental information content beyond the individual measures of client complexity and risk used in traditional audit fee models. Further, our findings have implications for fraud research by providing an ex ante factor that is a determinant of financial <b>reporting</b> <b>irregularities.</b> Preliminary draft—please do not quote...|$|E

40|$|Prior {{literature}} {{has demonstrated that}} religiosity {{is associated with a}} reduced acceptance of unethical business practices and financial <b>reporting</b> <b>irregularities.</b> On this premise, we examine whether religiosity, conceptualized as the degree of adherence to religious norms in the geographical area where a firm’s headquarters is located, has an impact on audit firms’ pricing decisions in the US. We measure the intensity of religiosity by the number of adherents relative to the total population in a county and demonstrate that increased religious adherence operates as an institutionalized monitoring mechanism that decreases audit risk and audit costs, which is, in turn, reflected in reduced audit pricing. Additional tests suggest that the impact of religiosity on auditors’ pricing decisions is not differentiated by levels of auditor expertise but that audit fees are determined by an auditor’s relative location in a market sector and religious adherence. We conclude that religious adherence reduces the need for shareholders to bear the costs of monitoring agents, a finding which could be of importance for market participants and regulators...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} version can {{be found}} at: [URL] Copyright CIWEMThis paper seeks to address a growing lack of historical knowledge in the water industry of how European Union (EU) water policy has developed and been responded to. It also aims to overcome the lack of comparative studies that explore the role politics has played {{in the development and}} application of EU water policy. As a result, this paper develops a historical comparative understanding of how England and Wales and the Republic of Ireland have responded to the Drinking Water Directive (80 / 778 /EEC). It does so from the perspectives of political priority and ideology. Political ideology is shown to have had a greater impact on facilitating the achievement of the Directive's standards in England and Wales. However, it is established that the political priority national governments have accorded compliance has been central to ensuring the application and enforcement of the Directive's standards. Despite the apparent success of political ideology in England and Wales, the paper sounds a note of caution with regard to judging privatisation as being uniformly successful, for it has not, particularly if issues of water charges, customer debt and financial and <b>reporting</b> <b>irregularities</b> are considered. ?? 2009 The Author.

40|$|Events {{leading to}} the breakup of Arthur Anderson and Co. {{included}} the failure of Enron and other evidence of financial <b>reporting</b> <b>irregularities.</b> Many of these irregularities involved restatement of financial statements due to error. During the last several years, numerous articles in the accounting literature and accounting press have chronicled such restatements and the often associated change in auditor. This paper analyzes restatements due to error and auditor changes made by Fortune 500 companies during 2001 and 2002 {{in order to assess}} whether restatements due to error lowered or raised income and whether companies with income-decreasing errors showed a greater propensity for changing auditors. The data in this study were taken from 8 -K reports filed by Fortune 500 Companies in 2001 and 2002 and from a search of the Securities and Exchange Commission 2 ̆ 7 s EDGAR database using the word 2 ̆ 2 restate 2 ̆ 2 and its derivatives. We searched for and analyzed restatements that were due to error. The income statement effects of these restatements were classified as income-decreasing or as non income-decreasing. We identified and confirmed two hypotheses related lo restatements. First, restatemenls generally lowered rather than raised income. Second. companies reporting restatements that materially reduced income were more likely to change auditors than companies with non income-decreasing errors. More importantly. this study extended prior research by showing that the magnitude, not simply the direction, of a restatement was important in explaining when a change in auditor was likely lo occur...|$|E
40|$|Using {{organizational}} theory, {{this research}} study examines whether a firm's business strategy influences the ethical culture and climate within the organization, and thus explains why a firm's business strategy may ultimately contribute toward {{an increased risk}} of financial misreporting. This study develops from recent research which finds that companies following an innovative, risk-oriented Prospector business strategy are significantly more likely to experience financial <b>reporting</b> <b>irregularities,</b> despite increased audit effort levels. To examine the research question, both survey and archival methods are employed. Using a large-scale research survey, I find two subset groups of Prospector firms where a smaller (larger) group is significantly associated with a less (more) ethical culture and climate, which offer insights into why companies following a Prospector business strategy continue to experience irregularities despite auditors' efforts. Results suggest auditors {{may not be able to}} distinguish between the two sets of Prospectors and thus may direct higher audit efforts too generally at Prospector firms rather than at the smaller set of firms with less ethical cultures and climates?i. e., firms more prone to rationalizing less ethical behavior. I also find that firms pursing a second type of strategy, a transitory Reactor strategy, are consistently associated with a negative ethical culture and climate. For a subset of public companies which can be linked to archival data, I find evidence to suggest that companies with less (more) ethical climates are associated with an increased (reduced) risk of financial misreporting while controlling for incentive and opportunity factors. I continue to find evidence that companies following a Prospector business strategy are associated with greater risks of misreporting, confirming prior research. Altogether, my findings suggest several antecedents for firms experiencing greater risk of financial statement misreporting and provide evidence regarding the third leg of the auditing fraud triangle (rationalization) ...|$|E
