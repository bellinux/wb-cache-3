2500|$|A {{pivoting}} arm {{equipped with}} a stop sign {{is a piece of}} equipment required by law on North American school buses. The sign normally stows flat {{on the left side of}} the bus, and is deployed by the driver while picking up or dropping off passengers. Some buses have two such stop arms, one near the front facing forwards, and one near the <b>rear</b> <b>facing</b> backwards. The stop sign is retroreflective and equipped either with red blinking lights above and below the [...] legend, or with a [...] legend that is illuminated by LEDs. Unlike a normal stop sign, this sign requires other vehicles travelling in both directions to remain stopped until the sign is retracted.|$|E
2500|$|The chapel is Neoclassical {{in style}} and has a {{rendered}} exterior which has now been painted over. [...] The walls underneath are brick. [...] The two-storey building has three bays, each with a sash window (described by Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner as [...] "oddly debased"). [...] A wide string course divides {{the upper and lower}} floors. [...] The entrance porch is flanked by pilasters and has a cornice and parapet with a tympanum. [...] Below the roofline, a set of three sash windows are topped with slightly recessed arches which extend above the level of the cornice; the centre arch is higher. [...] Above these is a pediment with a circular recess surrounded by four keystones. [...] At the <b>rear</b> (<b>facing</b> Tackleway), some of the original red-brick wall remains, although it has been altered. [...] There are some yellow brick dressings, three arched windows and another pediment.|$|E

2500|$|The {{building}} {{is one of}} the oldest surviving houses in Brighton, and has been called [...] "one of [...] most famous surviving early buildings". Its modest appearance and small size prompted architectural historian Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel, a former resident of Brighton, to call it [...] "as charming a relic of ... Brighthelmstone [...] as anyone could wish to see". It is a three-storey building with a modern shopfront on the lowest floor, two storeys in residential use above, and a large hipped roof with dormer windows. The top two floors are laid with black glazed mathematical tiles—often used in the 18th and 19th centuries on buildings in Brighton, and a characteristic feature of the local architecture. The second and third storeys also have canted bay windows; to the sides and <b>rear</b> (<b>facing</b> an ancient alleyway), original sash windows remain. The left dormer window is a casement, while the right has a sash window.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tower is}} the major {{component}} of the building, comprising 14 levels (B3 to L10) and a rooftop plant room and caretaker's flat (L11). The tower is a tall, narrow, rectangular block with a concealed timber-framed hipped roof clad with metal pan and rib sheeting. It is oriented with its long sides (the front and <b>rear)</b> <b>facing</b> north and south. These elevations are highly glazed with an external grid of white-painted, concrete sun hoods forming a shading [...] "egg crate". The hoods on the northern side project further than the south. The windows are large, double glazed aluminium framed casements and have spandrel panels inset with a chunky, white quartz aggregate. The window hardware {{has been removed from}} the sashes. The side (eastern and western) elevations are painted concrete, finely articulated with off-form-patterned panels. Largely windowless in comparison to the north and south, the eastern and western elevations have four columns of small, square aluminium-framed windows with opaque glass.|$|E
2500|$|The PRR also {{desired to}} apply the duplex {{principle}} to freight haulage, and the Q1 was the first experiment in that direction. It was a 4-6-4-4 fast freight locomotive delivered in May 1942. Like the B's George H. Emerson it had the second pair of cylinders facing backwards, and all were fitted with standard Walschaerts valve gear. The wheels were of [...] diameter (ill suited for freight hauling) and the engine was streamlined more like a passenger engine. The streamlining was later removed as it restricted maintenance work. The <b>rear</b> <b>facing</b> cylinders were also problematic, partially due to the inconvenient placement of being directly below the engine's firebox. Furthermore, the large drivers and smaller than adequate firebox grate area {{may have contributed to}} further problems as well. The limited firebox size was also a direct cause of the backwards facing cylinders. The lone Q1, PRR 6130, was constructed at the PRR's Altoona Works in 1942.|$|E

The entrance had a long access ramp at the <b>rear</b> <b>facing</b> Namur, protected by a tambour with gun embrasures perpendicular to the entry, a rolling drawbridge retracting laterally over a [...] pit equipped with grenade launchers, an entrance grille and a [...] gun firing along the axis of the gate.

60|$|The battle came on, at last, very suddenly, and at {{a moment}} when neither party were expecting it. A large {{detachment}} of both armies were advancing toward the position of the other, near the River Ticinus, to reconnoiter, when they met, and the battle began. Hannibal advanced with great impetuosity, and sent, at the same time, a detachment around to attack his enemy in the rear. The Romans soon began to fall into confusion; the horsemen and foot soldiers got entangled together; the men were trampled upon by the horses, and the horses were frightened by the men. In the midst of this scene, Scipio received a wound. A consul was a dignitary of very high consideration. He was, in fact, a sort of semi-king. The officers, and all the soldiers, so fast as they heard that the consul was wounded, were terrified and dismayed, and the Romans began to retreat. Scipio had a young son, named also Scipio, who was then about twenty years of age. He was fighting by the side of his father when he received his wound. He protected his father, got him into the center of a compact body of cavalry, and moved slowly off the ground, those in the <b>rear</b> <b>facing</b> toward the enemy and beating them back, as they pressed on in pursuit of them. In this way they reached their camp. Here they stopped for the night. They had fortified the place, and, as night was coming on, Hannibal thought it not prudent to press on and attack them there. He waited for the morning. Scipio, however, himself wounded and his army discouraged, thought it not prudent for him to wait till the morning. At midnight he put his whole force in motion on a retreat. He kept the camp-fires burning, and did every thing else in his power to prevent the Carthaginians observing any indications of his departure. His army marched secretly and silently till they reached the river. They recrossed it by the bridge they had built, and then, cutting away the fastenings by which the different rafts were held together, the structure was at once destroyed, and the materials of which it was composed floated away, a mere mass of ruins, down the stream. From the Ticinus they floated, we may imagine, into the Po, and thence down the Po into the Adriatic Sea, where they drifted about upon the waste of waters till they were at last, one after another, driven by storms upon the sandy shores.|$|E
