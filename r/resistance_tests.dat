We conducted a clinical trial at 6 US military hospitals in which volunteers infected with human immuno-deficiency virus type– 1 were randomized to have routine access to phenotype <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> (PT arm), access to genotype <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> (GT arm), or no access to either test (VB arm).

40|$|Abstract Background Current {{guidelines}} for providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa's public sector programme call for switching patients from first-line to second-line treatment upon virologic failure {{as indicated by}} two consecutive viral loads above 5000 copies/ml, but without laboratory evidence of viral resistance. We modelled the net cost of adding <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> for patients with virological failure and retaining patients without resistance on first-line therapy, rather than switching all failures to second-line therapy. Methods Costs were estimated for three scenarios: routine maintenance (standard care without <b>resistance</b> <b>testing,</b> switch all failures to second line); <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> (<b>resistance</b> <b>test</b> for patients with failure, switch those with resistance); and limited <b>testing</b> (<b>resistance</b> <b>test</b> for patients with failure {{in the first three}} years, switch those with resistance). A Markov model was used to estimate the cost of each arm over five years after first line initiation. Rates of treatment failure, viral resistance and treatment costs were estimated with primary data from a large HIV treatment cohort at a public facility in Johannesburg. Future costs were discounted at 3 %. Results Virological failure rates over five years were 19. 8 % in routine maintenance and 20. 2 % in <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> and limited testing; 16. 8 % and 11. 4 % of failures in routine and limited testing, respectively, did not have any resistance mutations, resulting in 3. 1 % and 2. 0 % fewer patients switching to second-line ART by the end of five years. Treatment costs were estimated at US$ 526 and $ 1268 per patient per year on first-line and second-line therapy, respectively; a <b>resistance</b> <b>test</b> cost $ 242. The total average cost per patient over five years was $ 2780 in routine maintenance; $ 2775 in resistance testing; and $ 2763 in limited <b>testing.</b> Conclusions Incorporating <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> into treatment guidelines in South Africa is potentially cost-neutral and can identify other reasons for failure, conserve treatment options, and generate information about emerging resistance patterns. </p...|$|R

40|$|The <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> kit is an assay {{to receive}} very quickly {{detailed}} information about the behaviour of adult insects in a phosphine atmosphere. The used concentration of 3, 000 ppm has a narcotic effect on non-resistant insects within a few minutes. Insects with a low phosphine susceptibility are still active after this time period. Using the <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> kit we succeed {{to distinguish between the}} tolerance of different insect species, the tolerance of one species at different concentrations and of different temperature regimes. The evaluation of different concentrations of phosphine, of their effectiveness against resistant strains of Lasioderma serricorne shows that at usual fumigation conditions resistant beetles can not be controlled with phosphine whereas at higher concentration 100 %-mortality of all development stages is achieved. Furthermore, longer exposure times have also a positive effect on the mortality of all development stages. The results confirm that the <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> kit is an effective device to recognize the resistance in an early stage, to fight against the development of resistance and to fight against the spreading of resistance.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} {{regional differences}} and trends in <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> among individuals experiencing virological failure and {{the prevalence of}} detected resistance among those individuals who had a genotypic <b>resistance</b> <b>test</b> done following virological failure. DESIGN: Multinational cohort study. METHODS: Individuals in EuroSIDA with virological failure (> 1 RNA measurement > 500 on ART after > 6 months on ART) after 1997 were included. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> following virological failure and aORs {{for the detection of}} resistance among those who had a test were calculated using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Compared to 74. 2 % of ART-experienced individuals in 1997, only 5. 1 % showed evidence of virological failure in 2012. The odds of <b>resistance</b> <b>testing</b> declined after 2004 (global P < 0. 001). Resistance was detected in 77. 9 % of the <b>tests,</b> NRTI <b>resistance</b> being most common (70. 3 %), followed by NNRTI (51. 6 %) and protease inhibitor (46. 1 %) resistance. The odds of detecting resistance were lower in tests done in 1997 - 1998, 1999 - 2000 and 2009 - 2010, compared to those carried out in 2003 - 2004 (global P < 0. 001). <b>Resistance</b> <b>testing</b> was less common in Eastern Europe [aOR 0. 72, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 55 - 0. 94] compared to Southern Europe, whereas the detection of resistance given that a test was done was less common in Northern (aOR 0. 29, 95 % CI 0. 21 - 0. 39) and Central Eastern (aOR 0. 47, 95 % CI 0. 29 - 0. 76) Europe, compared to Southern Europe. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a concurrent decline in virological failure and <b>testing,</b> drug <b>resistance</b> was commonly detected. This suggests a selective approach to <b>resistance</b> <b>testing.</b> The regional differences identified indicate that policy aiming to minimize the emergence of resistance is of particular relevance in some European regions, notably in the countries in Eastern Europe...|$|R

50|$|The term {{fire-retardant}} {{as applied}} to organic (i.e., containing carbon) materials, is intended to refer to reduced fire hazard, as all will burn under certain circumstances. The tests used specified in building codes, such as NFPA 701, are more correctly flame <b>resistance</b> <b>tests,</b> which test a fabric's ability to resist ignition with the flame size and duration in the test conditions. The result is a comparative test, which provides {{a measure of the}} material's resistance to propagating combustion caused by small scale ignition sources. These tests do not predict the burning characteristics of full scale hazards. In many cases, if exposed to a sufficiently large and sustained exposure fire, the fire-retardant fabrics will burn vigorously. Polyester is inherently flame retardant, and therefore doesn't flare up when applied to various tests. Any amount of heat delivered within a long enough time interval will have no impact on the fabrics' integrity while a limited amount of heat delivered within short enough time interval may ignite or melt the fabric. A simple method for evaluating the threshold incident energy for ignition or melting of fabrics as a function of convective and radiant heat flux has been developed.|$|E
