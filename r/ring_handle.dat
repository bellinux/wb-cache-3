40|$|A {{manual welding}} wire feeder {{apparatus}} comprising a bendable elongate metal frame with a feed roller mounted {{at the center}} thereof for rotation about an axis transverse to the longitudinal axis of the frame. The frame ends are turned up as tabs and each provided with openings in alignment {{with each other and}} the mid-width center of the roller surface. The tab openings are sized to accommodate welding wire and each extends to a side edge of the tab, both opening {{on the same side of}} the frame, whereby welding wire can be side-loaded onto the frame. On the side of the frame, opposite the roller a lock <b>ring</b> <b>handle</b> is attached tangentially and is rotatable about the attachment point and an axis perpendicular to the frame. The device is grasped in the hand normally used to hold the wire. A finger is placed through the loop ring and the frame positioned across the palm and lower fingers. The thumb is positioned atop the wire so it can be moved from the back of the frame across the roller, and towards the front. In doing so, the wire is advanced at a steady rate in axial alignment with the tab openings and roller. To accommodate different wire diameters the frame is bendable about its center in the plane of the frame axis and wire so as to keep the wire in sufficient tension against the roller and to keep the wire fixed when the frame is tilted and thumb pressure released...|$|E
2500|$|Between 425 and 350 BC Kabeiric vases {{were the}} main black-figure style in Boeotia. In most cases this was a hybrid form between a kantharos and a skyphos with a deep bowl and {{vertical}} <b>ring</b> <b>handles,</b> {{but there were also}} lebes, cups and pyxides. They are named after the primary place where they were found, the Sanctuary of the Kabeiroi near Thebes. [...] The scenes, usually painted on only one side of the vase, depict the local cult. The vases caricature mythological events in a humorous, exaggerated form. Sometimes komos scenes are shown, which presumably related directly to the cult.|$|R

50|$|The Kabiria vases are {{the main}} style of black-figure vases from Boeotia. Their modern name {{is derived from the}} {{sanctuary}} of the Kabiria near Thebes, where the majority of such vases were found. They are also known from the graves of the Theban warriors fallen in the Battle of Chaironeia in 338 BC. The shapes painted in the style are usually skyphoi, and sometimes hemispherical kantharoi with vertical <b>ring</b> <b>handles.</b> Some shapes, such as lebes are totally absent, other, such as kylikes and pyxidai occur rarely. The vessels were produced from about 425/420 until 250 BC or a bit later. They depict cult scenes, usually caricatures of mythological events. There are also scenes depicting the symposia that took place at the sanctuary. The type's main characteristic is the humorous and exaggerated style of painting, although it is not present on all the vases, as more serious depcitions of cult life also occur. The bulk of the vases is, in fact, decorated only with plant ornaments. Many are only painted on the front. Scholars recognise the hands of several individual artists, including the Mystai painter.|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} {{principal}} forms. The {{first is a}} round-bottomed footless krater with side handles and a plate-like rim (cf. example 1); the second is a similar krater on a pedestal. This latter is the shape known in Picenum, where its occurrence at Novilara puts its date at least as early as 600BC. From the round-bottomed krater is evolved the most peculiar and characteristic product of Canosa, that is, the double-storied jar. The plate-like rim has been developed into a deep bowl, which {{becomes more and more}} exaggerated during the 5th century until eventually it takes up nearly half the height of the entire jar. Strange fanciful additions are then made in the way of plastic ornament. To the ordinary <b>ring</b> <b>handles</b> are added a third and even a fourth, of increasingly fantastic kind.They may take the shape of an animal's face, most like a cat or an owl, or be formed like a thumbless human hand, which had probably some talismanic value. The fourth principal shape of pot is that which is known in Greece as an askos (cf. example 2), derived originally from an ordinary goatskin, and know at an early date over much of Sicily and Italy, but perhaps introduced by the Greeks.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the typological and archaeometrical study of the grip {{elements}} of pottery found in 2006 and 2007 during rescue excavation at the Larda 2 settlement (Gavello, Rovigo, north-eastern Italy). Placed within the middle Polesine territory at 15 km south-east of the present town of Rovigo, this site {{is located on the}} ancient Po di Adria, a palaeo-branch of the Po river, from which it was separated and shielded by an artificial and scarcely prominent embankment. On the basis of both the excavation report and preliminary typological observations on the grip elements of pottery (<b>ring</b> <b>handles,</b> straight-cylinder knobs, ribbon handles with raised edge and perforated apex, handles with protruding lobe and rostrum sometimes with hole, ribbon handles, hare-ear shaped handles, channelled handles), two different settling phases were recognised for the Late Bronze Age I, attesting occupation contemporaneous to the settlement of Larda 1, located only few hundred meters to the east. Some of the grip elements resulted typologically related to shapes found in coeval sites of the central-southern Venetian and Friulian territories, whilst others display a sub-Apennine style resembling that of the Terramare culture from the Emilian-Romagnole and Tuscan areas. Some of these types are also attested, although sporadically, in coeval sites in the southern Italy, indicating a wide diffusion of patterns during this period. Archaeometric characterisation was carried out on 41 selected samples, and aimed to assess the main technological features, such as the temperature and redox firing conditions, locate possible source areas of the raw materials, identify possible allochthonous items among those displaying a sub-Apennine character. Under optical microscope, Matrix resulted rather depurated and petrographically heterogeneous, with a fine- to medium-fine-grained texture and inclusions of grog, quartz, micas and ore minerals up to 30...|$|R
5000|$|Pull-ups (including chins) can be {{done with}} a supinated, neutral or pronated grip (often called [...] "chin-ups", [...] "hammer grip pull-ups", and [...] "pull-ups", in order). Grips may match each other or be {{different}} (mixed grip). Grips may also rotate throughout the movement, such as by doing them on <b>rings,</b> rotating <b>handles</b> (false grip) or pull up handles. The range of motion used by trainers can vary. The fullest possible range is with straight arms overhead (elbow directly above shoulder), to pulling when the arms are at the sides (elbow directly below shoulder). People sometimes only train portions, such as avoiding locking out the arms at the bottom, or stopping when the head/chin/neck touch the bar. Positions within the range are also trained isometrically, as in flexed-arm and straight-arm hangs for time.|$|R
25|$|Injective modules {{have been}} heavily studied, {{and a variety}} of {{additional}} notions are defined in terms of them: Injective cogenerators are injective modules that faithfully represent the entire category of modules. Injective resolutions measure how far from injective a module is in terms of the injective dimension and represent modules in the derived category. Injective hulls are maximal essential extensions, and turn out to be minimal injective extensions. Over a Noetherian ring, every injective module is uniquely a direct sum of indecomposable modules, and their structure is well understood. An injective module over one ring, may not be injective over another, but there are well-understood methods of changing <b>rings</b> which <b>handle</b> special cases. <b>Rings</b> which are themselves injective modules have a number of interesting properties and include rings such as group rings of finite groups over fields. Injective modules include divisible groups and are generalized by the notion of injective objects in category theory.|$|R

40|$|The {{handicap}} {{hypothesis of}} honest signaling suggests that secondary sexual characters reliably reflect phenotypic or genotypic quality of signalers. This hypothesis {{is based on}} the assumptions that signals are costly to produce and/or maintain and the cost of a given level of signaling is higher for low quality than for high quality signalers. We tested these assumptions in a field experiment in which the size of a secondary sexual character [tail length in male barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) ] was exper-imentally manipulated. Males were randomly assigned to tail elongation, tail shortening, or two control treatments (tail manip-ulation, or just capture, <b>ringing,</b> and <b>handling).</b> Male barn swallows were challenged with an injection of sheep red blood cells, and blood was sampled on the day of first capture and after 3 to 4 weeks for determination of concentrations of gamma-globulins. Tail-elongated males did not increase levels of gamma-globulins while males of the other three groups demonstrated increases. Analyses of variation in gamma-globulins within treatment groups revealed a positive correlation between gamma-globulins and original tail length among males with elongated tails. These results suggest that tail length imposes an immu-nocompetence cost on males, and that males with naturally long tails are differentially better able to cope with this cost. Ke...|$|R

30|$|For {{the past}} few decades, {{scholars}} have lots of researches in WMN access security, which aim at achieving safe and efficient access authentication systems. In Ref [4], the authors applied identity-based encryption and signature scheme to WMN access authentication. Mutual authentication is adopted between MC and authentication server without the protection of MC’s privacy. Ref [5]’s authors utilized Tor (The Onion Router Protocol) to protect the security of WMN router and the privacy of MC. But access authentication is ignored. Moreover, the extra-expense for saving and maintaining a routing table made the scheme not profitable. The authors of Ref [6] adopted Ring Signature for WMN anonymous authentication and communication. However, each MR needs to manage two certificates, which results in extra-burden. Besides, the cost for <b>handling</b> <b>ring</b> signature during authentication is large.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} a threshold-based wavelength allocation scheme {{in order to}} support fairness and service differentiation in WDM unidirectional ring networks. A <b>ring</b> network can <b>handle</b> different classes of traffic streams which differ by their hop-counts (i. e., the number of hops used from source to destination). We assume that for each class of traffic, call interarrival and holding times are exponentially distributed. In such a network, classes of calls with smaller hop-counts, experience lower blocking rates than ones with greater hopcounts. In this paper, a Multi-Threshold wavelength allocation scheme is proposed to provide equal blocking probabilities experienced by different classes. A recursive simulation-based algorithm is designed to numerically compute the optimal thresholds. Simulation results compare the performance of our proposed scheme, with that of Complete Sharing and Complete Partitioning schemes...|$|R
