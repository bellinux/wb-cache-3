40|$|Working Assessment is very {{essential}} aspect for {{a college}} to keep its excellent quality to face tight competition in either national or international level. The working assessment can be implemented to compare the result with organization strategy, and can also help to plan the upcoming strategy to achieve the final target of organization. The combination of Balanced Scorecard and OMAX is aimed at building the information system of working assessment in a college. Balanced Scorecard in the college is {{used to determine the}} strategic purposes, KPI and target, optimistic and pessimistic value. The scoring of each KPI uses AHP method; the scoring of KPI influences on general working score. The scoring of working assessment uses Objective Matrix (OMAX) method to know the total <b>result</b> <b>indicator</b> stated by the college, and can find out the total <b>result</b> <b>indicator</b> of each working criterion. The combination of BSC and OMAX can avoid the use of overwhelming data because this model focused on four perspectives, with the important key indicator of a college. Besides, the four perspectives can avoid the orientation of short-term target, because OMAX developed the more obvious frame of time that also focused on the long-term target. This combination was a good integration that can afford to modify hybrid model in determining the score card of a college.

40|$|Abstract—Microbial {{pathogens}} {{are one of}} {{the major}} health risks associated with water and wastewaters. Current methods for the detection of pathogenic viruses, bacteria, protozoa and helminths tend to be inaccurate, time consuming and expensive. As a <b>result,</b> <b>indicator</b> bacteria are commonly used to determine the relative risk of faecal contamination and the possible presence of pathogens in water and wastewaters. Indicator organisms, however, have several disadvantages that make them less than ideal for indicating the possible presence of microbial pathogens. Consequently methods to directly detect microbial pathogens in water and wastewaters are being investigated. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) {{is one of the main}} alternative detection methods being trialed. PCR has been shown to be a rapid, highly sensitive and accurate method. It has already been used experimentally to detect pathogenic viruses, bacteria and protozoa in water and wastewaters. PCR, however, has a number of limitations. One such limitation is the generation of false positives through the detection of naked nucleic acids, non-viable microorganism, or through contamination in the laboratory. Other limitations include inhibition by environmental contaminants and diculty in quantification. The potential of PCR for the direct detection of microbial pathogens in water and wastewater, as well as the curren...|$|E

40|$|Background: In resuscitation, {{normal saline}} could cause hyperchloremic {{metabolic}} acidosis, while balanced electrolyte solution is a crystalloid fluid resembling blood plasma with lower chloride content. This study compared {{the effect of}} normal saline and balanced electrolyte solution Ringerfundin (BES) as the resuscitation fluid in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) patients. Parameters applied {{in this study were}} standard base excess (SBE) as resuscitation’s <b>result</b> <b>indicator</b> and strong ion difference (SID) to measure chloride’s influence in developing hyperchloremic acidosis. Methods: A prospective, randomized, single blind controlled trial was conducted at the Emergency Department of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Thirty subjects with blood sugar > 250 mg/dl, arterial pH < 7. 35 mg/dl, and positive blood ketone were randomly allocated to receive either normal saline (NS) or RingerfundinÒ (BES) as the standardized resuscitation protocol. Data analysis was performed using the unpaired T-test and the Mann Whitney test to compare the SBE and the SID means between both groups. Additional parameters were the level of consciousness, blood sugar level, vital signs, blood gas analysis, lactate, electrolyte, and blood ketone. Results: The mean SID in the BES group was significantly greater than the NS group of all measurements (p< 0. 05). The BES group had significantly higher mean SBE compared to the NS group at 18 hours (- 4. 88 ± 5. 69 vs - 9. 68 ± 5. 64; p= 0. 009), 24 hours (- 3. 99 ± 4. 27 vs - 8. 7 ± 5. 35; p= 0. 023), and 48 hours (- 4. 06 ± 4. 11 vs - 7. 01 ± 5. 46; p= 0. 009). BES resulted in non-significant higher delta SBE and SID than NS. Additional parameters were not different between both groups. Conclusion: This study showed that fluid resuscitation of DKA patients with BES resulted in slightly but not significantly higher mean actual SBE and SID than NS. suggesting that BES as an alternative fluid resuscitation to prevent hyperchloremic acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients was not superior to NS. </p...|$|E
