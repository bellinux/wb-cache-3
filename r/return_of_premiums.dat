Under the Heston’s stochastic volatility model, this paper focuses on mean-variance insurers with the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> clauses to study the optimal time-consistent investment strategy for the DC pension merged with an annuity contract. Both accumulation phase before retirement and distribution phase after retirement are studied. In the time-consistent framework, the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated with the optimization problem are established. Applying stochastic optimal control technique, the time-consistent explicit solutions of the optimal strategies and the efficient frontiers are obtained. In addition, numerical analysis illustrates our results and also deepens our knowledge or understanding of the research results...|$|E

GMWB riders represent an embedded option on the account value with a fee structure that is different from typical financial derivatives.

Particular focus is placed on the distinct perspectives of the insurer and policyholder and the unifying relationship.

40|$|The {{guaranteed}} minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) rider {{guarantees the}} <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> {{in the form}} of periodic withdrawals while allowing policyholders to participate fully in any market gains. The product has evolved into a lifetime version (GLWB) and is a vital component of the variable annuity marketplace, representing asset values of 294 B as of September 2011. GMWB riders represent an embedded option on the account value with a fee structure that is different from typical financial derivatives. We present an in-depth study into pricing and hedging the GMWB rider from a financial economic perspective. Our main contributions are twofold. We construct a binomial asset pricing model for GMWBs under optimal policyholder behaviour which results in explicitly formulated perfect hedging strategies in a binomial world. The numerical toolbox for pricing GMWBs in a Black-Scholes world is expanded to include binomial methods. To motivate our work, we begin with a review of the continuous model and a comprehensive synthesis of results from the literature. Throughout, particular focus is placed on the unique perspectives of the insurer and policyholder and the unifying relationship. We also present an approximation algorithm that significantly improves efficiency of the binomial model while retaining accuracy. Several numerical examples are provided which illustrate both the accuracy and the tractability of the model. Finally, we explore the effect of deterministic mortality on pricing GMWBs, and run mortality simulations to obtain hedging results which support the diversification principle...|$|E

50|$|Calculation <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>premium</b> <b>of</b> a {{cancelled}} {{insurance policy}} is often done using a cancellation method called pro rata.

5000|$|... "Commutation provision" [...] means {{a verbal}} or written agreement, {{whether or not}} {{formally}} incorporated into an insurance or reinsurance policy, that allows the policyholder to commute the policy, usually implying that all liabilities and rights created by that contract are extinguished {{in return for the}} balance of an experience account. Generally provisions such as [...] "profit sharing" [...] or [...] "low claims bonus," [...] which also produce a <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> that can be reduced by claims payments, are not considered Commutation Provisions if they do not extinguish the contract.

40|$|Variable annuities {{are in the}} {{spotlight}} in today’s insurance market. The tax de-ferral feature {{and the absence of}} the investment risk for the insurer (while keeping the possibility of investment benefits) boosted their popularity. They represent the sensible way found by the insurance industry to compete with other stock market and financial intermediaries. A variable annuity is an investment wrapped with a life insurance contract. An insurer who sells variable annuities bears two different types of risk. On one hand, he deals with a financial risk on the investment. On the other hand there exists an actuarial (mortality) risk, given by the lifetime of the insured. Should the insured die, the insurer has to pay a possible claim, depending on the op-tions elected (<b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>premium,</b> reset, ratchet, roll-up). In the Black-Scholes model, the share price is a continuous function of time. Some rare events (which are rather frequent lately), can accompany jumps in the share price. In this case the market model is incomplete and hence there is no perfect hedging of options. I considered a simple market model with one riskless asset and one risky asset, whose price jump...|$|R
50|$|Term life {{insurance}} can be contrasted to permanent {{life insurance}} such as whole life, universal life, and variable universal life, which guarantee coverage at fixed premiums for {{the lifetime of}} the covered individual unless the policy is allowed to lapse. Term insurance is not generally used for estate planning needs or charitable giving strategies but is used for pure income replacement needs for an individual. Term insurance functions {{in a manner similar}} to most other types of insurance in that it satisfies claims against what is insured if the premiums are up to date and the contract has not expired and does not provide for a <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> dollars if no claims are filed. As an example, auto insurance will satisfy claims against the insured in the event of an accident and a homeowner policy will satisfy claims against the home if it is damaged or destroyed, for example, by fire. Whether or not these events will occur is uncertain. If the policyholder discontinues coverage because he or she has sold the insured car or home, the insurance company will not refund the full premium.|$|R

40|$|Plaintiff Dolores Smith {{appealed from}} a {{judgment}} in a {{favor of the}} Westland Life Insurance Company after a nonjury trial. Mrs. Smith, as the widow and administratrix of the estate of her husband, sought recovery of $ 10, 000 under a temporary life insurance contract. Mr. Smith had paid the first month’s premium and received a conditional receipt, {{also known as a}} binder or a binding receipt, from a soliciting agent of Westland on April 8, 1963. However, due to the hazardous nature of Smith’s employment as a railroad laborer, Westland issued him a modified policy, with increased premiums, on April 24. Smith refused to accept the amended policy or to pay the additional premium to the soliciting agent. On May 17, Westland, through its general agent, again submitted the proposed policy to Mr. Smith. When he refused it, the general agent told him that his premium would be refunded. The following morning, Smith died in an automobile accident. The trial court concluded that the conditional receipt created a provisional contract granting temporary life insurance. The Supreme Court of California reversed the judgment. This Case Note argues that, based on the facts of this case, the final result reached by the Smith court is both equitable and fair. If the insurance company does not feel that an applicant is an insurable risk under the original terms of the insurance contract, it should bear the risk of making him clearly aware of that fact.
