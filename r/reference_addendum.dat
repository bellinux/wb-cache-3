40|$|A {{wide variety}} of glycoconjugates covers the cell wall of prokaryotes, forming a unique species-specific barcode. These glycoconjugates are {{important}} to establish specific interactions with the environment. Most studies of bacterial glycobiology focus on pathogens. Here, the importance of glycosylation in the microbiota isolate and model probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is investigated, {{with a focus on}} glycoproteins. To shed light on how and why L. rhamnosus GG glycosylates part of its proteome, a multidisciplinary study was performed. A systematic in silico workflow was designed to mine the genome of L. rhamnosus GG for genes encoding glycosyltransferases, the key enzymes of glycobiology. Moreover, our method enabled the prediction of the substrate classes of these putative glycosyltransferases. Ultimately, we could identify 48 putative glycosyltransferases, of which 20 could be linked to their potential substrate and 8 putatively to a protein substrate. This genetic study was complemented by a second, now wetlab, proteomic screening, in which the fractionated proteome of L. rhamnosus GG was screened for glycosylated proteins, showing that the glycoproteome might encompass at least 40 glycoproteins, apart from the well-studied Msp 1 glycoprotein. To also perform a dedicated study on the functional importance of glycosylation in L. rhamnosus GG, the glycosylation of the SpaCBA pili was explored. A multidisciplinary approach enabled the confirmation of the glycosylation of these pili with mannose and fucose-residues. Moreover, we could show that their glycosylation is crucial for the interaction with the DC-SIGN immune lectin receptor present on dendritic cells. Taken together, we were able to achieve several breakthroughs by optimizing and designing new approaches. Our study generated important new insights in the glycosylation potential and the potential role of protein glycosylation in bacteria, like the potential role of glycosylation in the modulation of multiprotein complexes and interaction with immune lectin receptors. This work contributed to a better knowledge on the importance of glycoproteins in the interaction of probiotics and members of the microbiota with the host and the knowledge on bacterial protein glycosylation in general.

40|$|In {{this report}} we explore the {{remarkable}} connections between light-front dynamics, its holographic mapping to gravity in a higher-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, and conformal quantum mechanics. This approach provides {{new insights into}} the origin of a fundamental mass scale and the physics underlying confinement dynamics in QCD in the limit of massless quarks. The result is a relativistic light-front wave equation for arbitrary spin with an effective confinement potential derived from a conformal action and its embedding in AdS space. This equation allows for the computation of essential features of hadron spectra in terms of a single scale. The light-front holographic methods described here gives a precise interpretation of holographic variables and quantities in AdS in terms of light-front variables and quantum numbers. This leads to a relation between the AdS wave functions and the boost-invariant light-front wave functions describing the internal structure of hadronic bound states in physical space-time. The pion is massless in the chiral limit and the excitation spectra of relativistic light-quark meson and baryon bound states lie on linear Regge trajectories with identical slopes in the radial and orbital quantum numbers. In the light-front holographic approach described here currents are expressed as an infinite sum of poles, and form factors as a product of poles. At large $q^ 2 $ the form factor incorporates the correct power-law fall-off for hard scattering independent of the specific dynamics and is dictated by the twist. At low $q^ 2 $ the form factor leads to vector dominance. The approach is also extended to include small quark masses. We briefly review in this report other holographic approaches to QCD, in particular top-down and bottom-up models based on chiral symmetry breaking. We also include a discussion of open problems and future applications. Comment: Invited review article to appear in Physics Reports: 239 pages, 17 figures.

40|$|In this project, three estuarine and river-mouth areas, namely Cua Ong Estuary, Cua Luc Estuary and Cam River-mouth {{that belong}} to the Quang Ninh- Hai Phong coastal region (Vietnam) were {{investigated}} for the status as well as history and origin of the heavy metal and arsenic contamination of sediments. In addition, the speciation and mobility of heavy metals and arsenic under changing environmental conditions (Eh and pH) in vertical profiles or upon simulated on-land disposal of dredged sediments in the Cam River-mouth area (Hai Phong Province) were also investigated. The project included many different works including the collection of surficial bed-sediment and core-sediment samples, the performance of ripening experiments, porewater collection, single (ammonium-EDTA) and sequential (BCR 3 -step) extractions, and pHstat-leaching tests as well as analyses of chemical composition of major and trace elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, S, P, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn), anions (F-, Cl-, Br-, NO 2 -, NO 3 -, SO 42 - and PO 43 -, etc.), grain-size, mineralogy, organic matter content (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and 137 Cs isotope dating. In Cua Ong and Cua Luc estuaries, heavy metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) and As mainly display a natural origin (from the weathering and erosion processes of rocks). In contrast, in the Cam River-mouth, heavy metals and arsenic {{are considered to be}} minorly to moderately enriched as a result of anthropogenic activities in Hai Phong City and Northern Vietnam. Especially, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn in sediments increased rapidly by a factor of approximately 2 from 1954 to 1975 and then remained nearly unchanged from 1975 to 2008. In the Cam River-mouth, heavy metals (Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn) and As show overall decreasing trends of concentrations in porewater or sediment from top to bottom of a sediment core. Moreover, non-silicate fractions of these elements (exchangeable and carbonate-bound, Fe and Mn hydr/oxide-bound, and organic matter and sulphide-bound) also decrease from top to bottom {{as a result of their}} anthropogenic origin in surficial sediment layers and decreasing Eh and increasing pH values with depth. The pHstat-leaching tests on the original suboxic and oxidized sediments indicate that the pH-dependent leaching behavior of Cu, Mn, Pb, Zn and As reflects a V-shaped pattern in which they are strongly leached at highly-acid pH (2) or highly-alkaline pH (11), and minimum leachabilities are obtained in the slightly acid to slightly alkaline pH-range (6  8). Under the effect of oxidation, for Mn, Pb and Zn a transfer from the exchangeable and carbonate-bound fraction to the Fe and Mn hydr/oxide-bound fraction, and for Cu a transfer from the organic matter and sulphide-bound fraction to the Fe and Mn hydr/oxide-bound fraction occurred. In accordance with these results, Mn, Pb, Zn and As are characterized by a slower and lower release in the pH range 2  11 while for Cu, the pattern is opposite at pHs 2  8. A ripening experiment that simulates the on-land disposal of dredged sediments suggests that the porewater concentrations of heavy metals and arsenic increase immediately after exposure to the atmosphere, but then decrease to levels below their initial concentrations in the porewater. This implies a short-term risk for groundwater pollution by leaching of heavy metals and arsenic in the beginning of the on-land disposal, however, the risk will be mitigated with time when the oxidation further proceeds.

40|$|This Addendum supplements, and to {{some extent}} replaces, the {{preliminary}} description of environmental radiological surveillance programs for low-level waste burial grounds (LLWBG) used in the parent document, 11 Technology, Safety and Costs of DecolliTlissioning a Reference Low-Level Waste Burial Ground, 11 NUREG/ CR- 0570. The Addendum provides additional detail and rationale for the environmental radiological surveillance programs for the two referenced sites and inventories described in NUREG/CR- 0570. The rationale and performance criteria herein are expected to be useful in providing guidance for determining the acceptability of environmental surveillance programs for other inventories and other LLWBG sites. Two generic burial grounds, one located on an arid western site and the other located on a humid eastern site, are reference facilities considered in this Addendum, and as described in the parent document (NUREG/CR- 0570). The two sites are assumed to have the same capacity for waste, the same radioactive waste inventory, and similar trench characteristics and operating procedures. The climate, geology, and hydrology of the two reference sites are typical of existing western and eastern sites, altnough a single population distribution was chosen for both. Each reference burial ground occupies about 70 hectares and includes 180 trenches filled with a total of 1. 5 x 10 {sup 6 } m{sup 3 } of radioactive waste. In acldition, there are 10 slit trenches containing about 1. 5 x 10 {sup 3 } m{sup 3 } of high beta-gamma activity waste. In this Addendum environmental surveillance programs are described for the several periods {{in the life of a}} LLWBG: preoperational (prior to nuclear waste receipt); operational (including interim trench closures); post-operational (after all nuclear waste is received), for both short-term {up to three years) and long-term (up to 100 years) storage and custodial care; and decommissioning (only for the special case of waste removal). The specific environmental monitoring requirements for final site characterization and certification surveys are beyond the scope of this Addendum. Data collection associated with site reconnaissance and preselection is not specifically addressed, but it is recognized that such data may be useful in designing the preoperational program. Predisposal control measures, quality assurance, and record-keeping (other than inventory records) associated with waste disposal operations are also not addressed. The primary intent of routine environmental surveillance at a LLWBG is to help ensure that site activities do not cause significant transport of radioactivity from the site, resulting in an unacceptable health hazard to people. Preoperational environmental surveillance serves to determine for later comparison the background radioactivity levels, either naturally occurring or the result of man&#x 27;s activities (e. g. world-wide fallout or an adjacent nuclear facility), in and around the proposed burial ground site. The operational environmental surveillance program is used to estimate radiological conditions, both onsite and offsite as a possible result of burial ground activities, including trench closure(s). These data help to determine LLWBG compliance with regulatory requirements. During the post-operational period environmental surveillance should normally be an extension of the program carried out during operations, with appropriate deletions (or modifications) to account for the differences between operational and post-operational activities at the site. During the long-term storage and custodial care period, environmental surveillance serves to verify the radionuclide confinement capability of the burial ground and to identify problem situations requiring remedial action. For waste removal (exhumation), the environmental surveillance program is again modified to account for the greatly increased potential for direct radiation and contamination spread. At the time of decommissioning, "environmental surveillance" takes on a new meaning, from that of an ongoing program to one of site "characterization" and dose assessment, requiring more rigorous statistical design and testing than described for the other surveillance periods at a LLWBG. The environmental surveillance programs suggested in this Addendum are based on the radionuclide inventories given in Section 7 of NUREG/CR- 0570 and the potential critical pathways determined for the <b>reference</b> sites. The <b>Addendum</b> suggests the use of exposure pathway analysis to evaluate the potential critical pathways to man from radionuclides in the waste. Hence, the monitoring programs recommended for the two reference sites include those nuclide/media resulting in the highest potential radiation dose or those in which the greatest buildup of contaminants can be expected. Appropriate use is made of existing regulations and other published reports and guides on the subject of environmental surveillance...|$|R
