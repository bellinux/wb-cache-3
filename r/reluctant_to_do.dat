5|$|Agrippa's {{death in}} 12BC {{elevated}} Tiberius and Drusus {{with respect to}} the succession. At Augustus’ request in 11 BC, Tiberius divorced Vipsania and married Julia the Elder, Augustus' daughter and Agrippa's widow. Tiberius was very <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, as Julia had made advances to him when she was married and Tiberius was happily married. His new marriage with Julia was happy at first, but turned sour.|$|E
5|$|After Groza retired, he entertained {{an offer}} {{to play for the}} San Francisco 49ers, but was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so because {{he did not want to}} move his family and {{insurance}} business to the West Coast. He was offered a spot with the Browns as a kicking coach, helping mentor the young Don Cockroft, but he declined. Later in life, he became an ambassador and father figure for the Browns, inviting rookies over for dinner and helping them find apartments. He continued to run a successful insurance business and lived in Berea, Ohio near the Browns' headquarters and training facility. He and his wife Jackie were known as the team's First Family.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Lumumba {{hoped that}} the United Nations (UN), which sent a multi-national {{peacekeeping}} force to the Congo in July 1960, would help the central government to suppress both Katangese and South Kasaian secessions. The UN was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, however, considering the secessions to be internal political matters and its own mission to be maintaining basic law and order. Rejected by both the UN and United States, Lumumba sought military support from the communist Soviet Union. Within days of the secession and with Soviet logistical support, 2,000 ANC troops launched a major offensive against South Kasai. The attack was extremely successful. On 27 August, ANC soldiers arrived in Bakwanga.|$|E

5|$|Approximately at noon of 7 October 1991, Tuđman {{met with}} Stjepan Mesić, then President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia and Ante Marković, then Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, both ethnic Croats, in the Banski dvori. The {{purpose of the}} meeting was to persuade Marković to leave his {{position}} {{as the head of}} the Yugoslav federal government, which he appeared <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and to discuss the need for Croatia's independence. The meeting was adjourned for lunch that was to be attended by presidential aides. Tuđman made another effort at persuading Marković, trying to appeal to his Croatian origin. The three left the lunch as dessert was being served and moved into the president's office to continue their discussion. After Tuđman left the room, everyone else followed.|$|E
5|$|The mutineers divided {{themselves}} into three groups. A party of 100 went to obtain ammunition from Tanglin Barracks, where 309 Germans, including crew {{members from the}} German light cruiser SMS Emden, had been interned by the British. The mutineers fired on the camp guards and officers without warning, killing ten British guards, three Johore troops present in the camp and one German internee. Amongst the dead were Second Lieutenant John Love Montgomerie, Rifles; Sergeant G. Wald, (Reserve) Engineers; Corporal D. McGilvray, Rifles; Corporal G.O. Lawson, Cyclist Scouts; Lance Corporal J.G.E. Harper, Rifles; Private B.C. Cameron, Rifles; Private F.S. Drysdale, Rifles; Private A.J.G. Holt, Rifles and Stoker 1st Class C. F. Anscombe, HMS Cadmus. Three British and one German were wounded but survived the attack, as did eight Royal Army Medical Corps personnel in the camp hospital, including one who managed to escape under heavy fire to raise the alarm. The mutineers tried to persuade the Germans to join them, {{but many of the}} latter were shaken by the sudden violence and <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Some German sailors and reservists wanted to join with the mutineers, but the majority adopted a neutral stance, refusing to accept rifles from the Indians. Thirty-five Germans escaped but the rest remained in the barracks.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Deus Ex was {{revealed}} by Eidos in 2001 through job listings advertising for designers {{to work on}} the game. Later that month at the 2001 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Eidos confirmed that both the second Deus Ex and the next Thief game would be coming to consoles before arriving on PC; the explanation was that taking the restrictions of console hardware into account would make later ports to PC more effective. Eidos officially announced the game E3 2002; the platforms listed were PC, Xbox and PS2. It was later revealed that Ion Storm were struggling to work out how to port the game to PS2 given the extensive hardware differences between the three platforms, and were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so due to these issues. Following the game's release, it was clarified that no PS2 version would be developed. As part of the promotion, the soundtrack was made available for download through the game's website. A demo was released in November 2003. The game was released in North America on December 2, 2003. Following the North American release, Ion Storm released a patch to fix issues with the graphics and additional gameplay elements such as quick saves. The game released in Europe on March 5, 2004. The Xbox version was also released in Japan. First announced in March 2004, the game was released on June 17.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening of}} the battle saw four {{divisions}} (9th Australian, 51st Highland, 2nd New Zealand and 1st South African) in {{the assault on the}} north of the Axis positions. RWY was in support of the 5th New Zealand Brigade (Brigadier Howard Kippenberger); the aim was for infantry to secure the Miteiriya Ridge during darkness, with the armour to pass beyond them at first light to establish a screen. By now, the regiment was equipped with a mix of M4 Sherman, Crusader and Grant (M3 Lee) tanks. On the morning of 24 October 1942, A and C squadrons were ahead of the infantry on the western slopes of the ridge. B squadron had been delayed in the devil's gardens minefields and had lost numerous tanks. Throughout that day, A and C Squadrons engaged German panzers on the plain below, and were in turn hit by anti-tank fire. Initially, the heavier Sherman tanks were not vulnerable to this, but, when the German 88mm anti-tank guns joined in, they took severe casualties. By midday, the two squadrons were reduced to one Sherman and three Grants and the commanding officer had been badly wounded and evacuated. The 10th Armoured Division, under the command of Major-General Alexander H. Gatehouse, was at this stage supposed to pass through and onwards to start the break-out, but seemed to be <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E

40|$|Evaluations of {{teaching}} and assessment interventions often focus on pre- and postintervention changes in examination and/or coursework performance. Whilst these are important indicators in their own right, it is interesting also to review the student view of the intervention. This paper adds a further perspective to the examination performance improvements resulting from the introduction of Weekly-Assessed Tutorial Sheets (see Russell, 2005) {{by focusing on the}} voice of the student. In the case presented here, changing the assessment strategy not only improved the examination performance but also gave rise to improvements in Student Feedback Questionnaire (SFQ) returns as well as other positive observations about the experience. What is particularly interesting from the feedback {{is the fact that the}} students recognised the value of the assessment, wanted to see the approach transported to other modules and yet many were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> commit <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> the work unless it counted towards their grade for the module...|$|R

25|$|One major {{long-term}} {{concern for}} the Japanese labor force is its low birthrate. In {{the first half of}} 2005, the number of deaths in Japan exceeded the number of births, indicating that the decline in population, initially predicted to start in 2007, had already started. While one countermeasure for a declining birthrate would be to remove barriers to immigration, despite taking new steps towards it, the Japanese government has been <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, since foreign immigration to Japan has been unpopular among citizens.|$|E
25|$|Britain {{found itself}} {{bound by the}} Westminster Convention and entered the war on the Prussian side.

The Anglo-Prussian Alliance was established, which saw large amounts of subsidy given to Prussia. Some supporters of George II were strong advocates of support for Prussia, as they saw {{it would be impossible}} to defend his realm of Hanover if they were to be defeated. Despite his initial dislike of Frederick, the King later moved towards this viewpoint.|$|E

50|$|Tom, Greg, Jenny, and Zarth {{sit around}} {{discussing}} ideas for a plot for their fanfilm, deciding against {{a story about}} a mischievous not-good-but-not-evil Jedi, {{a story about a}} post-Return of the Jedi Boba Fett (sitting on his ass watching Jerry Springer all day), a story about all the sith in the galaxy competing for the master-and-apprentice positions, and a rock musical. Despite Tom's protests, everybody resigns <b>to</b> simply <b>doing</b> a lightsaber duel film. Tom approaches the <b>reluctant</b> Trekkies <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the visual effects, offering them ten percent of his store credit (which was all already spent on the lightsabers).

Canby was ordered to send all of his regular infantry to Kansas and raise two New Mexico regiments as replacements; however, Canby was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, both because he feared a Confederate invasion from Texas and also he didn't trust the local population, which he suspected of disloyalty.|$|E

The Han forces besieged and defeated the forces of Zhizhi Chanyu, and afterwards beheaded him. His head was sent to the Han capital Chang'an. On return to Chang'an, the two officers faced legal enquiries for forging a decree, but were pardoned. Chen and Gan received modest rewards, although the Han court was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so due to the precedent that this event set.|$|E

It is said that Zaynab, knowing of Abu Bakr's fondness for the desert life and his own reluctance to cause unwarranted bloodshed, advised Yusuf to confront Abu Bakr in a firm but courteous manner, and mollify him with luxurious presents. This Yusuf did, and the meeting passed without incident. Abu Bakr returned to the Sahara, but in a continuing homage his name remained on Almoravid coinage until his death some years later.|$|R

25|$|CPR has {{continued}} to advance, with recent developments including an emphasis on constant, rapid heart stimulation, without respiration. Studies have shown that people who had rapid, constant hands-only chest compression 22% more likely to survive than those receiving conventional, CPR that included breathing. What's more, because {{people tend to be}} <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> mouth-to-mouth, chest-only CPR nearly doubles the chances of survival overall, by increasing the odds of receiving CPR in the first place. An analysis of 3,700 cardiac arrests published Friday in the journal Lancet found that hands-only CPR saved 22% more lives than the conventional method. All told, the switch could save up to 3,000 additional lives a year in the USA and 5,000 to 10,000 in North America and Europe, says lead author Peter Nagele of Washington University in St. Louis.|$|E

25|$|The Kosovo War, which Blair had {{advocated}} {{on moral}} grounds, was initially a failure when it relied solely on air strikes; {{the threat of}} a ground offensive convinced Serbia's Slobodan Milošević to withdraw. Blair had been a major advocate for a ground offensive, which Bill Clinton was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and ordered that 50,000 soldiers – most of the available British Army – should be made ready for action. The following year, the limited Operation Palliser in Sierra Leone swiftly swung the tide against the rebel forces; before deployment, the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone had been on the verge of collapse. Palliser had been intended as an evacuation mission but Brigadier David Richards was able to convince Blair to allow him to expand the role; at the time, Richards' action was not known and Blair was assumed to be behind it.|$|E
