5000|$|The Baader Meinhof Complex (Der Baader Meinhof Komplex) is a 2008 German film by Uli Edel in {{his first}} directorial project since 2000's The Little Vampire. Written and {{produced}} by Bernd Eichinger, it stars Moritz Bleibtreu, Martina Gedeck, and Johanna Wokalek. The film {{is based on the}} 1985 German best selling non-fiction book of the same name by Stefan Aust. It retells the story of {{the early years of the}} West German far-left militant group the Rote Armee Fraktion (<b>Red</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Fraction,</b> or Red Army Faction, a.k.a.

5000|$|During the German Autumn the <b>Red</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Fraction</b> {{increased}} their activities.

Klaus Traube, a nuclear industrialist, was sympathetic to groups opposed to nuclear power. He was suspected of passing secret information to left-wing radicals. In 1975, in a covert operation called [...] "Operation Müll" [...] ("operation trash"), the BND, under the supervision of Maihofer planted a number of wiretaps in Traube's home. [...] They also later informed his employer who, as a result, dismissed him. This illegal operation was uncovered in 1977 by the magazine Der Spiegel.

During the night the precinct was illuminated by fifty-four spotlights and twenty-three neon bulbs. Special forces were guarding the roof, including snipers. Four hundred police officers along with the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution patrolled the building. The mounted police officers oscillated on a double shift. One hundred more GSG-9 units reinforced the police during the trial. BKA agents guarded the front of the court area. Finally there were helicopters flying around the area. In spite of this, the arrested guerrillas had firearms smuggled to them.|$|E

5000|$|Traube was {{originally}} {{a proponent of}} nuclear power, but {{the report of the}} Club of Rome, The Limits to Growth, in 1972 made him slowly change his view. As a result, he had contacts with the student movement in Germany, which at that time was slowly becoming more militant. He was also alleged to have contacts with sympathisers of the <b>Red</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Fraction.</b> The BfV therefore started to monitor him intensively. He was suspected of passing secret information to people sympathising with terrorism. In a covert operation called [...] "Operation Müll" [...] ("operation rubbish"), the BND in 1975 planted a number of wiretaps in Traube's apartment. They also later informed his employer who, as a result, fired him. This illegal operation was uncovered in 1977 by the newspaper Der Spiegel and led to the dismissal of the then minister of the interior Werner Maihofer one year later. Traube was cleared of all charges. The Three Mile Island accident in 1979 finally transformed him into an open opponent of nuclear power.|$|E

The intense efforts by the Federal Criminal Bureau (BKA) to render visible the network of places and modes of travel used by the RAF in its terrorist activities, and the impacts this effort had on ?normal? social spaces, highlight the importance of the geographical and epistemological prerequisites that underlie the possibility of a ?nationalization? of spaces of exception.

This thesis follows genesis of the left terrorism in the Federal Republic of Germany in the context of cooperation with the GDR Ministry of Security. The first part of the work analyses the origin of the group, followed by its activities until the end. The next part is devoted to a brief survey of bilateral contacts of both the German states from the mid 60 s to the late 80 s of the last century. This is the basis for the following chapter. The relevant part of this thesis is represented by chapter 3 which gives analysis of the competition between Stasi and RAF terrorist groups, from the early contacts of the 1 st RAF generation members. It mentions the participation of Bewegung 2.

40|$|The {{terrorist}} group <b>Red</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Fraction</b> ("RAF"), which jeopardized the public security with their attacks in West Germany since the seventies and {{killed more than}} three thousand people, issued a statement of official closure on April 20, 1998 after 28 years of its activity. This thesis tries {{to answer the question}} whether the fall of the Berlin Wall brought the final dissolution of the group. In addition to geopolitical changes it is also necessary {{to take into account the}} instruments of the national security policy and the split of opinion within the group. The geopolitical reversal in 1989 had two negative impacts on the RAF. Firstly it meant a devastating ideological defeat for them, even though the former GDR or any other Eastern Bloc country did not respond fully to their expectations. Another shock for them was the arrest of ten former RAF-members who were hiding in the GDR under a false identity. They eventually filed an extensive testimony, so that their sentences could be commuted. Federal Republic of Germany, which had not been too successful in the fight against terrorism up to this time, used the internal weakness of the RAF caused by political circumstances and it finally introduced new instruments to further destabilize the group and led to a rift between prisoners and members at large [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Terrorism has {{through the}} last few years become an {{increasingly}} part of our everyday lives. The attack on World Trade Centre the 11 th of September 2001 resolved in a state of terror which perhaps hasn’t been seen since the assault in Munich in 1972. This report attempts to analyze the development of terrorism from the seventies to present day time. To show this development, it focuses on two well-known terrorist groups – Al Qaeda, present day, and the <b>Red</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Fraction,</b> the seventies. The purpose of this report is furthermore to show how cultural changes can affect terrorism, thus the report also includes three major theorists and their theories. Apart from the theories, there have been used articles, concerning the groups, from the seventies and today, together with the groups’ own manifesto and fatwa. All of the above have been worked with through analytical and comparative methods, which should ensure part of the picture of terrorism and the responses to it, through history. The report concludes that terrorism is an ideology which purpose is to make illegitimate, political changes through violence. Furthermore it shows, how terrorism has developed, from being of a secular nature, into a religious one, which is chained together with cultural issues. Finally, it concludes how these changes are related to globalization, and that this creates new possibilities for the terrorists, e. g. through alternative means of communication...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{essentially}} {{a study in the}} geography of knowledge. It argues, first, that, at a critical juncture in the development of Foucault's ideas about what he called 'neoliberal governmentality', his involvement in a West German political controversy on the fringes of the struggle between the FRG government and the <b>Red</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Fraction</b> (or 'Baader-Meinhof Gang') significantly influenced his conception of neoliberal power. Secondly, I present evidence highlighting Foucault's subsequent failure to develop the line of thinking spurred by German events, and suggest that this failure can be traced to a dispute with other French intellectuals over whether the FRG government could be termed 'fascist'. The paper will likely draw a good deal of attention, both because it is the first study to focus so strongly on the impact of contemporary German politics upon Foucault's thought, and because it highlights a hitherto unremarked but clearly demonstrable disjuncture in that thought. The journal Foucault Studies is read by a wide range of scholars across the social sciences and humanities. Foucault?s lectures from early 1979 on the German Ordo-liberalen are typically taken to comprise his most comprehensive account of why Germany is important for understanding neo-liberal governmentality more broadly. This paper argues, to the contrary, that the 1979 lectures actually obscure a potentially more complete account of German, neo-liberal governmentality Foucault had begun to sketch in 1977. To support this reading and to offer an explanation of why Foucault would have decided to alter his presentation of West German neo-liberalism, the paper undertakes a genealogy of Foucault?s involvement with West German political issues in 1977 and 1978. The core claims that structure the argument are as follows: (1) Key aspects of the ?security state? that Foucault began to work out in 1977, must have been at least partly modeled on West German ?militant? or ?battle-ready? democracy; (2) Yet, in his 1979 lectures, {{there is no longer any}} trace of these repressive, extralegal dimensions; (3) This shift was motivated to a significant extent by his 1977 disagreement with Deleuze, Guattari, and others over whether the West German state of the late 1970 s could be considered ?fascist. ? This concern to contest the accusation of fascism is carried forward in his 1979 lectures in a critique of ?state phobia. ?Peer reviewe...|$|E
