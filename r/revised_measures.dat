25|$|The Peruvian {{government}} {{has played a}} moderate role in responding to corporate-community conflict arising from the mineral industry. In January 2012, the Humala administration established an international commission {{with the task of}} identifying ways to reduce the environmental effects of the Newmont Mining Corporation's Conga project. Newmont was forced to comply with the <b>revised</b> <b>measures</b> before resuming operations. When government officials presented the new terms to local community members in order to gain their consent, they were faced with considerable opposition and violent protests ensued. Thus, though the national {{government has}} taken some steps towards addressing social protest, it is often unable to adequately address communities' expectations about corporate accountability and the regulation of environmental damage caused by mining activities. Another example concerns mining conflict in Peru's Piura region. Between 1998 and 2003, conflicts arose between the Canadian company Manhattan Minerals and members of the Tambogrande community. Following a local referendum in which 93% of the community voted against mining operations, Manhattan Minerals left the region. Similar conflicts ensued when another corporation, Monterrico Minerals, began conducting exploration work in Piura's highland provinces. This conflict led to the death of two farmers during violent protests and incited many national and international actors to intervene. A referendum took place once again and more than 90% of the population voted against mining. Despite such opposition, Monterrico Metals and the government of Peru insisted that the mining operations go forward. According to the Community Development Journal, such conflicts demonstrate that the government is largely absent in helping community members and corporations to reach mutual agreements. As a result, local community members often view the government as a biased mediator that favors corporate interests. With a lack of government intervention, community members resort to protest in attempt to resolve issues stemming from the mineral industry.|$|E

The new formulation {{has been used to}} revise the output, capacity, and utilization rates back to 1977.

40|$|Purpose : This article aims {{to review}} the {{appropriateness}} of five general quality of life (QoL) measures for the Muslim patients with cancer. Method : The literatures related to QoL in patients with cancer, published between 1981 and 2011 were critically reviewed. Several database databases including CINAHL, MEDLINE as well as PUBMED, ProQuest, Elsevier, Google scholar and reference list were included. There were 25 articles best fit the inclusion criteria. Books and journal articles addressing Islamic principles were also reviewed. Result : QoL is a complex, multidimensional, and subjective phenomenon. It has been defined differently but overlapping by many scholars in the field. The patient’s QoL is important since {{it is one of}} the indicators of quality cancer care. The EORTC QLQ C 30, FLIC, McGill QoL are the examples of widely used QoL measures which are appropriate to be applied in Muslim cancer population, while the FACT-G and CARES SF need to be revised in some of their items. Issues related to Islamic principles are discussed to support needs of further revision of these QoL measures.

40|$|Introduction Bariatric {{surgery is}} {{considered}} the most effective weight loss intervention for obese persons. However, accurate assessment is essential to identify disordered eating that may impair achievement of optimal post-surgical outcomes. Measures of disordered eating are yet to be thoroughly psychometrically evaluated in bariatric surgery patients, therefore their utility is unknown. Methods Participants were 108 adults who completed psychological measures approximately 12 months after bariatric surgery. The fit of the original scale structures was tested using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and alternative factor solutions were generated using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). Reliability (internal consistency) and construct validity (convergent and divergent) were also assessed. Materials Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Questionnaire of Eating and Weight Patterns Revised (QEWP-R), Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) and Clinical Impairment Assessment (CIA). Results CFA revealed none of the original disordered eating measures met adequate fit statistics. EFA produced revised scales with improved reliability (original scales α = 0. 47 – 0. 94; revised scales α = 0. 76 – 0. 98) and correlational analyses with measures of psychological wellbeing and impairment demonstrated adequate convergent validity. Reported prevalence of disordered eating behaviours differed between the EDE-Q and QEWP-R. Conclusions Psychometric evaluation {{did not support the}} use of the commonly used disordered eating measures in bariatric patients in their original form. The revised version of the EDE-Q replicates findings from recent research in bariatric surgery candidates. The alternate structures of the CIA and TFEQ suggest differences in the manifestation of disordered eating following surgery.

40|$|It's {{surprising}} {{to learn that}} the water-rich state of Massachusetts experiences incidences of water stress, where rivers go dry for stretches of the year and where municipalities struggle to meet water demand. Water conservation and demand management is one important part of reducing pressures on water supplies and alleviating ecosystem stress. Although the state has recently revisited water management policies and has promoted <b>revised</b> <b>measures</b> to increase conservation, the actual measures taken are implemented on the scale of the municipality. This thesis examines three affluent suburban municipalities located in stressed river basins in eastern Massachusetts that have taken different degrees of conservation and demand management efforts. The stories reveal that the decisions to curb water demand have been influenced by the degree to which towns have experienced a perceptible limit to their supply. These towns also show us how a crisis, or an event of water shortage, can bring focus to the limits of water, providing an opportunity for town managers to redefine the problem {{in such a way that}} conservation is the solution. (cont.) As towns continue to face increasing pressure on water supplies, some municipalities would like to turn to regional water. Although these regional systems can help offset some ecological pressures as well as promote economy of scales, it raises questions as to whether such a system would remove the perceptible limit that gives impetus for conservation. by Anna L.

The changes are generally small and principally affect data from 2000 to the present.; Measured from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, industrial output is now reported to have increased at a slower rate in 2000 and to have contracted a bit more slowly in 2001 than reported earlier. The changes to total industrial production in other years are slight. The revision still places the most recent peak in total IP in June 2000 and the corresponding trough in December 2001. The 6 - 1 / 4 percent peak-to-trough decline in output is about 1 / 2 percentage point less than the previous estimate.

We also question the idea that economic growth is always synonymous with improved well-being. Useful measures of progress and well-being must be measures {{of the degree to which}} society?s goals (i. e., to sustainably provide basic human needs for food, shelter, freedom, participation, etc.) are met, rather than measures of the mere volume of marketed economic activity, which is only one means to that end.

Some of these are <b>revised</b> <b>measures</b> of economic activity while others measure changes in community capital?natural, social, human, and built?in an attempt to measure the extent to which development is using up the principle of community capital rather than living off its interest.

40|$|Sciences (ARI) has {{conducted}} an ongoing program {{of research on}} the development and use of non-cognitive predictors for selection and classification. Non-cognitive predictor is a broad term that includes any measure not specifically designed to assess cognitive aptitude or knowledge. It includes such measures as temperament or personality, experience, attitudes, and judgment. ARI’s current program of research on non-cognitive predictors traces its roots to Project A, a congressionally-mandated research and development program to evaluate and enhance the Army's personnel selection and classification procedures (Campbell & Knapp, 2001). A prominent non-cognitive test to result from Project A was the Assessment of Background and Life Experiences (ABLE). The ABLE measured a set of job-related motivational constructs that were predictive of duty performance and first-term attrition (Young, Heggestad, Rumsey, & White, 2000). Unfortunately, the ABLE was found to be susceptible to faking by Soldiers who wanted to display a more favorable impression. Despite the problems associated with faking, the strong relationships of the ABLE with valued outcomes inspired ARI researchers to pursue further development to address the measurement issues. However, concern about fakability of temperament measures inhibited the adoption of these <b>revised</b> <b>measures</b> in an operational environment for many years and the Army continued solely to use the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) for selection and classification.
