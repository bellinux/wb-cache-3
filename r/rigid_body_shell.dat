40|$|Figure 1 : Water {{and cloth}} {{interacting}} with full two way coupling (256 × 256 × 192 effective resolution octree, 30 K triangles in the cloth). We present a novel method for solid/fluid coupling that can treat infinitesimally thin solids modeled by a lower dimensional triangulated surface. Since classical solid/fluid coupling algorithms rasterize the solid body onto the fluid grid, {{an entirely new}} approach is required to treat thin objects that do not contain an interior region. Robust ray casting is used to augment a number of interpolation, finite difference and rendering techniques so that fluid does not leak through the triangulated surface. Moreover, we propose a technique for properly enforcing incompressibility so that fluid does not incorrectly compress (and appear to lose mass) near the triangulated surface. This allows for the robust interaction of cloth and shells with thin sheets of water. The proposed method works for both <b>rigid</b> <b>body</b> <b>shells</b> and for deformable manifolds such as cloth, and we present a two way coupling technique that allows the fluid’s pressure to affect the solid. Examples illustrate that our method performs well, especially in the difficult case of water and cloth where it produces visually rich interactions between the particle level set method for treating the water/air interface and our newly proposed method for treating the solid/fluid interface. We have implemented the method on both uniform and adaptive octree grids...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{approach}} to fracturing (and denting) brittle materials. To avoid the computational burden imposed by the stringent time step restrictions of explicit methods or with solving nonlinear systems of equations for implicit methods, we treat the material as a fully <b>rigid</b> <b>body</b> {{in the limit of}} infinite stiffness. In addition to a triangulated surface mesh and level set volume for collisions, each <b>rigid</b> <b>body</b> is outfitted with a tetrahedral mesh upon which finite element analysis can be carried out to provide a stress map for fracture criteria. We demonstrate that the commonly used stress criteria can lead to arbitrary fracture (especially for stiff materials) and instead propose the notion of a time averaged stress directly into the FEM analysis. When objects fracture, the virtual node algorithm provides new triangle and tetrahedral meshes in a straightforward and robust fashion. Although each new <b>rigid</b> <b>body</b> can be rasterized to obtain a new level set, small shards can be difficult to accurately resolve. Therefore, we propose a novel collision handling technique for treating both <b>rigid</b> <b>bodies</b> and <b>rigid</b> <b>body</b> thin <b>shells</b> represented by only a triangle mesh...|$|R
40|$|A {{framework}} {{for the development of}} robust time integration schemes for nonlinear, flexible multibody systems is presented. The proposed schemes are designed to meet four specific requirements: nonlinear unconditional stability of the scheme, a rigorous treatment of both geometric and material nonlinearities, exact satisfaction of the constraints, and the presence of high frequency numerical dissipation. Specific algorithms are presented for <b>rigid</b> <b>bodies,</b> cables, beams, <b>shells,</b> and elasto-dynamics. The kinematic nonlinearities are treated in a rigorous manner for all elements, and the material nonlinearities can be handled when the constitutive laws stem from the existence of a strain energy density function. The treatment of the constraint equations associated with the six lower pair joints are presented as well. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with specific numerical examples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The most computationally expensive aspects of <b>rigid</b> <b>body</b> dynamics are collision detection, correcting interpenetration between bodies and the environment, and handling resting contact. <b>Rigid</b> <b>bodies</b> are commonly simulated iteratively, with back-tracking to correct error using smaller timesteps.
