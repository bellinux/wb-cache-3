The coupling to the resonator generates positive correlations in the currents flowing through each of the SETs as well as between the two currents. In the regime where the dynamics of the resonator is dominated by the back-action of the SETs, these positive correlations can lead to parametrically large enhancements of the low frequency current noise. These noise properties can be understood in terms of the effects on the SET currents of fluctuations in the state of a resonator in thermal equilibrium which persist for times of order the <b>resonator</b> <b>damping</b> time.

Here, ΔW is the energy dissipated during one cycle of vibration, and W is the maximum elastic strain energy during the vibration cycle. It is difficult to measure energy dissipation or entropy generation directly; hence, damping is estimated by monitoring structural dynamics using such techniques as harmonic excitation, free decay, thermomechanical noise, and wave propagation [5].

One essential question in quantum simulation is to probe the properties of an emulated many-body system.

40|$|We analyse {{the quantum}} {{dynamics}} of a nanomechanical resonator coupled to a normal-state single-electron transistor (SET). Starting from a microscopic {{description of the}} system, we derive a master equation for the SET island charge and resonator which is valid {{in the limit of}} weak electro-mechanical coupling. Using this master equation we show that, apart from brief transients, the resonator always behaves like a damped harmonic oscillator with a shifted frequency and relaxes into a thermal-like steady state. Although the behaviour remains qualitatively the same, we find that the magnitude of the <b>resonator</b> <b>damping</b> rate and frequency shift depend very sensitively on the relative magnitudes of the resonator period and the electron tunnelling time. Maximum damping occurs when the electrical and mechanical time-scales are the same, but the frequency shift is greatest when the resonator moves much more slowly than the island charge. We then derive reduced master equations which describe just the resonator dynamics. By making slightly different approximations, we obtain two different reduced master equations for the resonator. Apart from minor differences, the two reduced master equations give rise to a consistent picture of the resonator dynamics which matches that obtained from the master equation including the SET island charge.

40|$|The sound {{generated}} or {{absorbed by}} short circular holes {{with a mean}} flow passing through them is relevant in many practical applications. Analytical models for their acoustic response often {{ignore the fact that}} such holes open to a confined or finite space either side, or account for this e ect simply by adding an end mass inertial correction. The vortex-sound interaction within a short hole has been recently shown to strongly a ect the acoustic response at low frequencies [D. Yang and A. S. Morgans, J Sound Vib 384 (2016), pp. 294 – 311]. The present study considers a semi-analytical model based on the Green’s function method to investigate how the expansion ratios either side of a short hole a ect the vortex-sound interaction within it. After accounting for expansions to confined spaces using a cylinder Green’s function method, the model is substantially simplified by applying a half-space Green’s function for expansions to large spaces. The e ect of both the up- and downstream expansion ratio on the acoustics of the hole is investigated.

40|$|A direct photon-phonon {{parametric}} {{effect of}} the quadratic coupling on the mean-field dynamics of an optomechanical resonator in the large-scale-movement regime is found and investigated. Under a weak pumping power, the mechanical <b>resonator</b> <b>damps</b> to steady state with a nonlinear static response sensitively modified by the quadratic coupling. When the driving powerincreases beyond the static energy balance, the steady states lose their stabilities via Hopf bifurcations and the resonator produces stable self-sustained oscillation(limit-circle behavior) of discrete energies with step-like amplitudes due to the parametric {{effect of the}} quadratic coupling, which can be understood roughly by the power balance between gain and loss on the resonator. A further increase of the pumping power can induce chaotic dynamic of the resonator via a typical routine of period-doubling bifurcation but which can be stabilized by the parametric effect through an inversion bifurcation process back to limit-circle states. The bifurcation-to-inverse-bifurcation transitions are numerically verified by the maximal Lyapunov exponents of the dynamics and which indicate {{an efficient way to}} suppress the chaotic behavior of the optomechanical resonator by the quadratic coupling. Furthermore, the parametric effect of the quadratic coupling on the dynamic transitions of an optomechanical resonator can be conveniently detected or traced by the output power spectrum of the cavity field.

40|$|<b>Damping</b> in MEMS <b>resonators</b> was studied {{experimentally}} and numerically. Quality factor {{measurements were}} performed on Draper gyroscopes made from boron doped silicon wafers with varying amount of germanium (0 %, 2 %, 23 %, 30 %). The quality factors of gyroscopes with germanium were measured to be lower than those without germanium, due to increased anelastic damping. Specifically, the decreased thermal conductivity in the devices with germanium causes those devices to experience thermoelastic damping of a greater magnitude than the germanium-free devices. The amount of damping exhibited {{is found to be}} well explained by existing analytical expressions for thermoelastic dissipation in a beam model. The governing equations of thermo elasticity dictate that the amount of <b>damping</b> that a <b>resonator</b> undergoes is a function of both material properties as well as device geometry. Damping will become greatest at operating cycle times that are of the same scale as the thermal relaxation times of the device material. Due to the fact that analytical expressions exist for only a few simple geometries, a finite element model was developed to evaluate thermoelastic damping in more complicated geometries. The finite element model is demonstrated to be in good qualitative agreement with the analytical expressions, and is used to analyze the impact of design modifications such as the addition of fillets and anchors to a simple beam model. It is shown that depending on the size scale of the resonator (which dictates the amount of internal damping), these geometric modifications may either hinder or improve <b>resonator</b> <b>damping</b> characteristics. by John P.

40|$|Conventional {{rotational}} rheometers {{are typically}} limited to around 100 Hz. In order to extent the frequency domain, {{a couple of}} methods have been proposed [1]. These are however typically stand alone instruments {{and only a few}} have been commercially available. In the present work we pursue an approach aimed at miniaturizing in-plane plate resonators for possible add-on integration into standard rheometers. The lithographically structured plates have primary mechanical resonance frequencies up to 10 kHz. Lorentz force excitation and an inductive readout mechanism allow the measurement of the frequency response by monitoring the electrical two port behavior [2]. The fluid-structure interaction is dominated by decaying shear waves with penetration depths of typically a few to tens of micrometers, exact values depend on the mass density and viscoelastic moduli. The resonance frequency and damping are sensitive to the fluid forces and therefore can be used to measure the rheological properties of liquids. In our work, we will present the modeling approach including the eigenmode solution of the mechanical resonance, the fluid-structure interaction, and the electrical equivalent circuit describing the excitation and readout mechanisms. The theoretical model is verified using a set of low to intermediate viscosity liquids demonstrating the measurement technique and consistency of the modeling approach. For an aqueous silica suspension it is shown that the <b>resonator</b> <b>damping</b> is determined by the steady shear viscosity.
