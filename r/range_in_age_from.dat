5|$|The Canadian Rockies are {{composed}} of sedimentary rock, including shale, sandstone, dolomite and limestone. The vast majority of geologic formations in Banff <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>age</b> <b>from</b> Precambrian to the Jurassic periods (600–145 m.y.a.). However, rocks as young as the lower Cretaceous (145–66 m.y.a.) can be found near the east entrance and on Cascade Mountain above the Banff townsite. These sedimentary rocks were laid down in shallow seas between 600 and 175 m.y.a. and were pushed east and over top younger rocks during the Laramide orogeny. Mountain building in Banff National Park ended approximately 55 m.y.a.|$|E

The nearly 40 major sedimentary rock layers exposed in the Grand Canyon and in the Grand Canyon National Park area <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>age</b> <b>from</b> about 200million to nearly 2billion years old. Most were deposited in warm, shallow seas and near ancient, long-gone sea shores in western North America.

5|$|South Dakota {{geologic}} formations and deposits <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>age</b> <b>from</b> {{several billion}} to several thousand years, {{and the age}} of the rocks generally decreases as one moves from west to east across the state. The oldest geologic formations in the state were created over two billion years ago during the Precambrian, and consist of metamorphic and igneous rocks. These form the central core of the Black Hills, but they can also be found in two isolated locations in eastern South Dakota near Milbank and Sioux Falls. Formations from the Paleozoic Era form the outer ring of the Black Hills; these were created between roughly 540 and 250 million years ago. This area features rocks such as limestone which were deposited here when the area formed the shoreline of an ancient inland sea.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota {{is a state}} {{located in}} the north-central United States. It is usually {{considered}} {{to be in the}} Midwestern region of the country. The state can generally be divided into three geographic regions: eastern South Dakota, western South Dakota, and the Black Hills. Eastern South Dakota is lower in elevation and higher in precipitation than {{the western part of the}} state, and the Black Hills are a low, isolated mountain group in the southwestern corner of the state. Smaller sub-regions in the state include the Coteau des Prairies, Coteau du Missouri, James River Valley, the Dissected Till Plains, and the Badlands. Geologic formations in South Dakota <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>age</b> <b>from</b> two billion-year-old Precambrian granite in the Black Hills to glacial till deposited over the last few million years. South Dakota is the 17th-largest state in the country.|$|E

5|$|The National Repertory Orchestra (NRO) is an American summer symphony {{orchestra}} and academy that offers full fellowships to train young musicians for professional careers in music through performances, master classes and workshops. Based in Breckenridge, Colorado since 1993, its members, who <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>age</b> <b>from</b> 18 to 29, are selected from auditions held each year throughout the United States. NRO presents an eight-week series including two orchestral programs per week conducted by its Music Director Carl Topilow (conductor {{and director of}} the orchestral program at the Cleveland Institute of Music) as well as guest conductors. The orchestra was founded in 1960 by cellist and conductor Walter Charles. The orchestra was formerly known as the Blue Jeans Symphony based in Estes Park, Colorado, and later as the Colorado Philharmonic Orchestra based in Evergreen, Colorado.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{collected}} from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth, as measured by radiometric dating techniques. They <b>range</b> <b>in</b> <b>age</b> <b>from</b> about 3.2 billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria, to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust. As such, they represent samples from a very early period {{in the development of}} the Solar System, that are largely absent on Earth. One important rock found during the Apollo Program is dubbed the Genesis Rock, retrieved by astronauts David Scott and James Irwin during the Apollo 15 mission. This anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineral anorthite, and is believed to be representative of the highland crust. A geochemical component called KREEP was discovered by Apollo 12, which has no known terrestrial counterpart. KREEP and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the Moon was once completely molten (see lunar magma ocean).|$|E
