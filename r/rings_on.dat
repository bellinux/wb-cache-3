5|$|Gymnopils maritimus {{is clearly}} a {{different}} species from other members of its clade, despite their close relation. All other species in the clade grow upon dead wood and have well-developed <b>rings</b> <b>on</b> their stems. The spores also differ; {{in the case of}} G.junonius and G.spectabilis (often considered synonymous), as well as G.pampeanus, they are narrower, {{and in the case of}} G.imperialis, they are wider. Of the other members of the clade, only G.junonius and G.spectabilis also grow in Europe.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} sixteen, {{he found}} work as a factor's clerk in a {{warehouse}} at Horseley Fields, Wolverhampton, until the early 1880s {{when he left the}} warehouse after failing to repay a loan. He then worked for a lock manufacturer called Osborne in Lord Street, Wolverhampton, until he was dismissed for theft in either 1884 or 1885. For the next few years, his whereabouts are not known for certain, but he appears to have lived an unsettled life in the English Midlands and Yorkshire. In 1887, he was making a living as a hawker, selling small items such as pencils and key <b>rings</b> <b>on</b> the streets of Snow Hill, Birmingham.|$|E

A serpent may be depicted in his matted hair, which is also adorned by the crescent moon. His forehead bears a tripundara, the Shaiva tilaka composed of three horizontal lines of sacred ash with a red dot in the middle representing the third eye. He wears a patta (ornamental head band)—sometimes adorned with a human skull motif—on his forehead. Snake ornaments adorn his body, and bronze images often depict multiple necklaces, a waist-band, armlets, elbow bands, bracelets, anklets, and <b>rings</b> <b>on</b> all his toes and fingers. A snake is also tied around his waist and a white yagnopavita (sacred thread) is worn across the chest.|$|E

5|$|Body {{piercing}} in some religions is {{held to be}} {{destructive to}} the body. Some passages of the Bible, including Leviticus 19:28, have been interpreted as prohibiting body modification because the body is held to be the property of God. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has taken an official position against most piercings unless for medical reasons, although they accept piercings for women {{as long as there}} is only one set of piercings in the lower lobe of the ears and no other place on the body. Wearing of very large nose <b>rings</b> <b>on</b> Shabbat is forbidden by the Talmud.|$|E
5|$|Clock {{towers in}} Western Europe in the Middle Ages were also {{sometimes}} striking clocks. The most famous original still standing is possibly St Mark's Clock {{on the top}} of St Mark's Clocktower in St Mark's Square in Venice, assembled in 1493 by the clockmaker Gian Carlo Rainieri from Reggio Emilia. In 1497, Simone Campanato moulded the great bell on which every definite time-lapse is beaten by two mechanical bronze statues (h. 2,60 m.) called Due Mori (Two Moors), handling a hammer. Possibly earlier (1490) is the Prague Astronomical Clock by clockmaster Jan Růže (also called Hanuš) – according to another source this device was assembled as early as 1410 by clockmaker Mikuláš of Kadaň and mathematician Jan Šindel. The allegorical parade of animated sculptures <b>rings</b> <b>on</b> the hour every day.|$|E
5|$|Earlier restorations had {{all left}} their {{marks on the}} frescoes. To {{counteract}} the whitening caused by salination, animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most obvious in the small putti which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was saltpetre seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark <b>rings</b> <b>on</b> the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly {{the case for the}} lunettes, spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives.|$|E

A key {{at the side of}} the instrument at the same height as the A key lifts only one of the two covers, producing G a semitone lower. The A key can be used in conjunction solely with the register key to produce A/B.|$|E

5|$|West Point {{began the}} collegiate {{tradition}} of the class ring, beginning with the class of 1835. The class of 1836 chose no rings, and the class of 1879 had cuff links {{in lieu of a}} class ring. Before 1917, cadets could design much of the ring individually, but now only the center stone can be individualized. One side of the ring bears the academy crest, while the other side bears the class crest and the center stone ring bears the words West Point and the class year. The academy library has a large collection of cadet <b>rings</b> <b>on</b> display. Senior cadets receive their rings during Ring Weekend in the early fall of their senior year. Immediately after senior cadets return to the barracks after receiving their rings, fourth class cadets take the opportunity to surround senior cadets from their company and ask to touch their rings. After reciting a poem known to cadets as the Ring Poop, the senior usually grants the freshmen permission to touch the ring. In 2002, the Memorial Class ring donor program began. Donations of class rings are melted and merged. A portion of the original gold is infused with gold from preceding melts {{to become part of the}} rings for each 'Firstie' class.|$|E
5|$|Before marriage, women {{used to wear}} a Kirgi (sari) and Baju (blouse). The Kirgi is a {{piece of}} cloth not longer than four feet, and about three feet wide. It was wrapped around the body from the waist down. A jacket with long sleeves called a Baju, was used to cover {{the upper part of the}} body. This dress was a sign of the bride's virginity and was worn during the Ros ceremony. The Kirgi was wrapped around the waist, but the end of the sari is not thrown over the shoulder. To wear the sari with its end thrown over the shoulder, known as Worl, is the {{exclusive}} right of a married woman. Married women used to wear sarees the general way. The Salwar kameez is another form of popular dress for females. The Mangalorean Catholic bride's wedding sari is known as a Sado. It is usually a red-coloured Banarasi sari which is made of finely woven silk and is decorated with elaborate engravings. In olden days, the bride wore on her head a red cloth, three feet square. Gold ornaments were absent in those days: the bride went to the church dressed as a virgin girl. In modern times, the bride wears (in place of the Kirgi) a red sari, but the end of the sari is not thrown over the shoulder; it is wrapped around the waist. The bride wears a few gold ornaments, some <b>rings</b> <b>on</b> the fingers, earrings, and at least two of the Dantoni (golden combs). Other ornaments worn by the bride in the olden days included Kanti, Chakrasar, Kap, Karap, Mugud, Kanto, and Dantoni.|$|E
