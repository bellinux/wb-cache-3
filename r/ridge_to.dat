5|$|Upon {{attaining}} typhoon status, Pamela {{was a small}} {{tropical cyclone}} with a central dense overcast spanning 280km (175mi) in diameter. After completing its counterclockwise loop, the typhoon began a slow motion to the northwest, once the <b>ridge</b> <b>to</b> its west diminished. On May18, it passed within 95km (60mi) of Chuuk, and around that time Pamela developed a circular eye about 18km (12mi) in diameter. The typhoon steadily intensified as it began a more steady northwest movement due to a <b>ridge</b> <b>to</b> its east, and on May19 Pamela attained peak winds of 240km/h (150mph) about 485km (300mi) southeast of Guam. At that time, it had gusts to 295km/h (185mph).|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} in the Indian Ocean {{intertropical convergence zone}} became evident southeast of the Chagos Archipelago on March16 after two cyclones {{moved away from the}} region. Based on analysis from MF, the system slowly organized while moving westward, its movement influenced by a subtropical <b>ridge</b> <b>to</b> the south. On March17, the JTWC also began tracking the system. Due to cool, dry air, the system initially did not intensify, although its passage over warmer sea surface temperatures on March19 allowed for strengthening. On March19, MF classified the disturbance as Tropical Storm Nadia after rainbands developed. A day later, the JTWC designated Nadia as Tropical Cyclone 23S.|$|E

5|$|A {{strengthening}} <b>ridge</b> <b>to</b> {{the south}} turned the storm to the southwest, bringing Gillian back over water; however, the circulation became poorly-defined and the convection decreased due to land interaction. Early on 11March the JTWC discontinued advisories. When Gillian was downgraded to a tropical low, the proximity {{to land and}} continued wind shear prevented initial redevelopment. The system tracked westward through the Gulf of Carpentaria due to the <b>ridge</b> <b>to</b> the south, passing just north of Mornington Island on 12March. The next day, the convection reorganised as the circulation became better defined. On14 March, the JTWC again assessed a high potential for Gillian redeveloping into a tropical cyclone, noting {{the appearance of a}} central dense overcast. At 06:00UTC on the same day, the BoM again upgraded Gillian to tropical cyclone status in the central Gulf of Carpentaria. Due to a weak trough in the region, the storm turned to the northeast. Increasing wind shear again caused the storm to lose organisation early on 15 March, prompting the BoM to downgrade Gillian to a tropical low.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, Eline was still encountering wind shear and dry air. Despite these factors, the eye became better defined and the storm intensified, aided by favoring upper-level conditions. The cyclone turned {{more to the}} west toward Madagascar, despite a weakness in the <b>ridge</b> <b>to</b> the south. While approaching the country, Eline quickly intensified, reaching 10‑minute winds of 165km/h (105mph) by 18:00UTC on February17. Around that time, the cyclone made landfall on eastern Madagascar near Mahanoro. Eline rapidly weakened over land while moving to the west-southwest, and the JTWC downgraded the storm to tropical depression status within 18hours of moving ashore.|$|E
5|$|Although an {{air-cooled}} {{design was}} chosen for the reactor at Oak <b>Ridge</b> <b>to</b> facilitate rapid construction, it was recognized {{that this would be}} impractical for the much larger production reactors. Initial designs by the Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont used helium for cooling, before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build. The design did not become available until 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford Site by erecting accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and upgrading the electricity, water and telephone lines.|$|E

5|$|An area of {{convection}} {{developed on}} May2, 2002 near Sri Lanka, {{associated with a}} weak and broad circulation center. The system tracked west-northwestward through the Arabian Sea along a trough near the equator. Its thunderstorm activity was enhanced by a <b>ridge</b> <b>to</b> its north, though was also removed from the center. By May5, the circulation had become better defined, and concurrently the convection increased over the center. After further organization, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as Depression ARB01A on May6. Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it as Tropical Depression 01A, while located about 1300km (800mi) southeast of Salalah, Oman.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the third}} stage of General Sir Herbert Plumer's Passchendaele offensive, an attack against Broodseinde was {{scheduled}} for 4 October 1917.

Covering the sector west of the Lunga to the coast were the 1st and 5th Marine Regiments. Defending {{the mouth of the}} Matanikau for the Americans were two battalions under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William J. McKelvy: the 3d Battalion, 1st Marines, and the 3d Battalion, 7th Marines. McKelvy's force was separated from the Lunga perimeter by a gap that was covered by patrols.|$|E

50|$|Stove-top pan {{grilling}} is {{an indoor}} cooking process {{that uses a}} grill pan — similar to a frying pan but with raised <b>ridges</b> <b>to</b> emulate the function or look of a gridiron. In pan grilling, heat is applied directly to the food by the raised ridges and indirectly through the heat radiating off the lower pan surface by the stove-top flame. Stove-top grill pans {{can be used to}} put sear marks on meat before it is finished by overhead radiant heat. When cooking leaner meats, oil is often applied <b>to</b> the pan <b>ridges</b> <b>to</b> aid in food release.|$|R
