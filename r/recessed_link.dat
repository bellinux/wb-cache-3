The <b>recessed</b> <b>link</b> creates a court on the Davenport Street side of the place, between the two main components of the council chambers, visually separating the buildings.|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} this building, {{situated}} within the ‘Asakusa District’, Tokyo, Japan, was foremost {{inspired by a}} number of works in the minimalist art style, strongly focusing on the geometric forms of the square and cube. Its primary function is as an office block, featuring a split-level that holds a number of partitioned conferences and meeting rooms. The lower level is dedicated to the need for greater public space in this region of Tokyo, where there is a large public sculpture garden that opens outwards from the street side. This area is skirted {{by a number of}} retail outlets that service the area. Within the enclosed space {{at the end of this}} public domain is an exhibition space, which could be used by the public for art displays, functions, etc. The concept that I formulated for this project was three-fold, which incorporated a number of influences that I used during the design process. The first was a reflection of the cities angular geometry as a whole, into a single structure. The second being the incorporation of the cube into the building as a whole, separating each individual space into a cube, joined by a <b>recessed</b> <b>link.</b> Thirdly, within Tokyo there are little or no buildings that join directly to adjacent buildings, always separated by a alley or street. Therefore I used the cubic geometry to separate each individual section of the building into a seemingly individual unit. I believe that overall the project has taught me a number of things about the design process as a whole, specifically about the importance of the incorporation of influences into a concept, as well as the importance of refining ideas into a more successful final product.

40|$|This {{research}} article discusses recess {{as part of}} the elementary school day with strong implications for school climate. Positive school climate has been linked to a host of favorable student outcomes, from attendance to achievement. The article examines 6 low-income elementary schools' experiences implementing a recess-based program designed to provide safe, healthy, and inclusive play to study how improving recess functioning can affect school climate. Data from teacher, principal, and recess coach interviews; student focus groups; recess observations; and a teacher survey are triangulated to understand the ways that recess changed during implementation. Comparing schools that achieved higher- and lower-functioning <b>recesses,</b> we <b>link</b> <b>recess</b> functioning with school climate...|$|R

Composition, in Jacobean style, is symmetrical, comprising {{a central}} one storey and attic block linked by single-storey ranges to taller 2-3 storey side blocks. Central block with Dutch gables to west, north and south, the west one facing {{the entrance and}} with an attic window. Windows generally are ovolo-moulded cross casements, cornices are saw-toothed. 2 square one-storey pavilions flank main entrance right and left. <b>Recessed</b> <b>linking</b> blocks had retaining walls with taller central doorways enclosing forecourt, but this remains now only to south side. Main outer blocks with cross casements, Dutch gables to all faces (north return of north block with twin shaped gables), and frontal (west) polygonal towers with doors at the bases and pierced parapets at the top. Gabled roofs carry romantically-placed 2- and 3-flued stacks. Platform canopies supported on square section welded steel piers of late C20. The piers rise to timber braces within which are cast-iron scrolled brackets. Inner face of main west range with 4 arches right and left of central entrance to booking hall.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The castle was a {{rectangular}} building, three storeys and a garret high. A wing with crow-stepped gables {{was added to}} form the L-plan. The parapet of the original tower was bridged across a <b>recessed</b> lintel as <b>link</b> to the new wing. [...] The first storey is vaulted, while other storeys have been modernised. There is a stair tower in the re-entrant angle, round, but corbelled to square above. [...] There is a new entrance through a pedimented Gothic porch.|$|R
5000|$|The bar {{windows and}} glazed doors have cut, engraved, and frosted glass. The upper floors have <b>recessed</b> sash windows <b>linked</b> by ornate iron {{balconies}} {{on the second}} and third floors. The slate roof is framed by a stucco molded parapet with a prominent stucco main entablature with deep cornices and lions' head modillions. Centered on both sides are upstands with [...] "The Albert" [...] incised on them. The interior retains some bar fittings that date back to c. 1900.|$|R
40|$|DE 10249238 A UPAB: 20040611 NOVELTY - Micro-mechanical {{differential}} pressure sensor has a substrate with first and second <b>recesses</b> that are <b>linked</b> by a channel (11) and filled with an incompressible liquid. Both cavities (9 a, 9 b) are sealed with an inelastic membrane that is deflected by a pressure change but not stretched. An electrically conducting electrode (4 a, 4 b) {{is applied to the}} top of each membrane so that two capacitors are formed between the electrodes and the respective bottoms of each cavity. The electrodes are connected to contacts (5) that are connected to an evaluation circuit. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - When used, one cavity is connected to each of the differing pressures. USE - Micro-mechanical {{differential pressure}} sensor. ADVANTAGE - The inventive pressure sensor chip is relatively inexpensive to produce while being highly resistant to sudden pressure changes or pressure overloads...|$|R
