Several experiments have been conducted in this respect, he results analysed using proper pattern <b>recognition</b> <b>software’s</b> and thus the inference drawn from them. Some of typical examples of vibrations produced by a moving train, minor vibrations produced by various household machines have been analysed.

40|$|Abstract — In today's world, speech {{recognition}} {{has become very}} popular and important. Over the past 20 years, despite considerable advances in computer technology, the keyboard and video display are still the principal means of entering and retrieving data. However, {{as the use of}} computers increases, the need for interacting with the computer also grows. This demand has generated a need for an intuitive human-machine interface to accommodate {{the increase in the number}} of users. Over the recent years, advances in {{speech recognition}} technology have enabled a wide range of voice-enabled services. However, after years of research and development the accuracy of automatic speech <b>recognition</b> <b>software’s</b> remains an important research challenge. This paper presents a brief survey on the features and applications of Automatic Speech Recognition systems and investigates the results of these systems for medical domain questions. Our results suggest that as the medical questions are quite long and complex, this domain differs from the open domain and requires additional work in automatic speech recognition to be adapted as per the domain...|$|R
