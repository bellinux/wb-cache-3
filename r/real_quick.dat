60|$|This {{is a true}} story. It {{happened}} in Markdale to an uncle of my mothers. He wanted to marry Miss Jemima Parr. Felicity says Jemima is not a romantic name for a heroin of a story but I cant help it {{in this case because}} it is a true story and her name realy was Jemima. My mothers uncle was named Thomas Taylor. He was poor at that time and so the father of Miss Jemima Parr did not want him for a soninlaw and told him he was not to come near the house or he would set the dog on him. Miss Jemima Parr was very pretty and my mothers uncle Thomas was just crazy about her and she wanted him too. She cried almost every night after her father forbid him to come to the house except the nights she had to sleep or she would have died. And she was so frightened he might try to come for all and get tore up by the dog and it was a bull-dog too that would never let go. But mothers uncle Thomas was too cute for that. He waited till one day there was preaching in the Markdale church {{in the middle of the}} week because it was sacrament time and Miss Jemima Parr and her family all went because her father was an elder. My mothers uncle Thomas went too and set in the pew just behind Miss Jemima Parrs family. When they all bowed their heads at prayer time Miss Jemima Parr didnt but set bolt uprite and my mothers uncle Thomas bent over and wispered in her ear. I dont know what he said so I cant right it but Miss Jemima Parr blushed that is turned red and nodded her head. Perhaps some people may think that my mothers uncle Thomas shouldent of wispered at prayer time in church but you must remember that Miss Jemima Parrs father had thretened to set the dog on him and that was hard lines when he was a respektable young man though not rich. Well when they were singing the last sam my mothers uncle Thomas got up and went out very quitely and as soon as church was out Miss Jemima Parr walked out too <b>real</b> <b>quick.</b> Her family never suspekted anything and they hung round talking to folks and shaking hands while Miss Jemima Parr and my mothers uncle Thomas were eloping outside. And what do you suppose they eloped in. Why in Miss Jemima Parrs fathers slay. And when he went out they were gone and his slay was gone also his horse. Of course my mothers uncle Thomas didnt steal the horse. He just borroed it and sent it home the next day. But before Miss Jemima Parrs father could get another rig to follow them they were so far away he couldent catch them before they got married. And they lived happy together forever afterwards. Mothers uncle Thomas lived to be a very old man. He died very suddent. He felt quite well when he went to sleep and when he woke up he was dead.|$|E

30|$|Overall {{cost for}} data storage, transmission, and {{analysis}} to remotely monitor the first injection site is around 1000 $ per month. Adding about 200 $ more allows each additional injection site to be monitored. The cost {{does not include}} internet expense of each injection site. Compared to onsite real-time monitoring, remote real-time monitoring is more cost effective to improve operation efficiency. This is because onsite real-time monitoring requires at least one highly experienced injection specialist at injection site during operation to view real-time data and make operation decisions. In addition, injection data that cannot be reviewed and analyzed remotely in <b>real</b> time limits <b>quick</b> collaboration between on-site personnel and remote subject matter experts when operational issues arise.|$|R

Starting from the first satellite IRS- 1 A, all IRS series of satellites, have been provided with a sub-sampled mode of image display at all IRS data reception stations. Initially the image extraction from the baseband data and the sub-sampled display was realized through a customized hardware processor. Later on the total <b>real</b> time <b>quick</b> look data processing and display of sub-sampled image data functionality has been shifted to software. With a need for variation in the scope for the application like only data acquisition, data acquisition & quick look display at full resolution /subsampled with quick geometric and radiometric correction, deployment based application re-configurability has become a requirement. This paper presents the design and implementation of a real-time application for IRS satellite data acquisition, archival, preprocessing and visualization of full resolution image data for Resourcesat- 2 satellite by implementing task parallelism on multi-CPU multi core platform architecture which can be reconfigured for selected functions based on the need and platform being used...|$|R

The credibility of the available numbers also plays against us: data on money handled, men, weapons or the fleet were often consciously manipulated by those who used them, according to their own interests. Thus, when it was intended to dissuade the enemy, the potential of the forces themselves tended to increase; while, in order to get aid from the Allies, the tendency was to reduce the value of the own army.

Our approach focusses on <b>real</b> time and <b>quick</b> detection, scalability to large networks, and a negligible false alarm generation rate.

Our implementation shows that the method has a 100 % detection rate for attacks above its threshold level - those attacks that produce statistically significant QoS degradation. The detection time is low and less than about 15 minutes. The maximum inherent false alarm generation rate for both the tests and any of the monitored measures combined is of the order of 1 false alarm in 1000 valid status alerts of either normal or under attack. We believe that given the results of the tests on our implementation of the attacks and the detection system, the method is a strong candidate for QoS intrusion detection for a low-cost commercial deployment...|$|R
