The article presents the benefits in terms of increasing power parameters and there is also a comparison of speed characteristics. The aim of the tuning was to increase the engine power parameters, in particular the torque in the range of 4 000 - 6 000 min- 1, at which the engine most often operates during competitions.

40|$|In {{the frame}} of this {{dissertation}} the evaluation of energy and efficiency parameters for the basic soil cultivation using showels with different edge thickness was carried out. Field evaluation of energy and efficiency parameters of sets for soil cultivation was done with tractor John Deer 7810 + combined loosener. The comparison of energy and efficiency parameters of the sets using showels having average edge thickness 2, 16 mm, 4, 17 mm and 6, 23 mm was done. Two variants of the engine performance A and B were selected. A variant: A full supply of fuel was selected, using shift gears the motor was kept in the revolution limit of 1600 - 2000 min- 1. B variant: Before the ride the fuel supply was set {{in the way that}} the revolutions of unloaded engine were 1800 min- 1. Shifting the motor gears the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolutions</b> was 1600 - 1800 min- 1. Shifting the motor gears the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolutions</b> was 1600 - 1800 min- 1. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the thickness of the loosener edge and the working regime of the tractor engine on energic and efficiency parameters. The data could be concluded in following way: By increasing the tension resistance due to the showel thickness by the determined working engine regimes the working speed was lowered and this way the efficiency of the working set as well; The fuel reduction and higher efficiency could be reached by the suitable selection of the shape and dimensions of the working machine parts used for soil cultivation and good technical working conditions; Areal efficiency by the fixed engine working regimes is influenced by the depth of cultivation, thus the value of energic parameters were calculated in the relation of the soil cultivated; Linear course of the edge thickness on the energy demand of the soil cultivation was proved by both laboratory and field tests; When suggesting a suitable set, i. e. the selection of suitable tractor for a given machine it is necessary to consider its working resistance and tension power in relation to the given soil conditions; From values obtained the so called economy regime, when the engine works with the specific fuel consumption, is obvious; When it is not possible to use full performance of the tractor engine it is convenient to change the working regime of the engine by lowering the fuel supply on the presumption that agrotechnical demands on the particular operations will be carried out. On the basic of the presented thesis with the aim of establishing the effect of edge thickness of the working parts of the loosener and effect of the tractor motor working regime on the energic demand of the soil cultivation some other questions appeared. Their study is the subject of future research. They are listed here: Study of the effects of the shape and dimension changes of the working parts of soil cultivation machinery on the energic demand of the given operation; Establishing the optimal working speed considering the quality of labour and minimal speed of wear; Establishing the minimal thickness of the soil machinery working parts edge considering the maximal durability of the working parts and minimal specific resistance; Establishing the optimal regime of the engine performance in relation to the fuel consumption and efficiency of the set.

40|$|Isochronous mass {{spectrometry}} (IMS) established in heavy-ion storage rings {{has proven to}} be a powerful tool for mass measurements of short-lived nuclides. In IMS, the <b>revolution</b> times <b>of</b> stored ions should be independent of their velocity spread. However, this isochronous condition is fulfilled only in the first order and in a small <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> times. To correct for non-isochronicity, an additional measure of the velocity or magnetic rigidity of each stored ion is required. For this purpose two new time-of-flight (TOF) detectors were installed in one of the straight sections of the experimental cooler storage ring in Lanzhou. It is expected that the resolving power of the IMS will significantly be improved with such a double-TOF arrangement. The double-TOF system was tested in a recent experiment with the 78 Kr fragments.

40|$|In {{the paper}} an {{identification}} of low speed diesel engine operation in direct propulsion plant equipped with {{fixed pitch propeller}} during ship manoeuvring. It was starting of engine and gathering speed of ship. Analysis of engine operation was based on changes of engine torque and time of ship bring up to speed. Operation of reciprocating internal combustion engine consists in converting the supplied fuel energy and delivering it to ship propeller. This condition implicates converting different amounts of energy in different time. The main attention was given to operation of engine caused by crank pin forces in wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolutions</b> and their influence on mechanical load of ship propulsion plant. The torque is the major component determining the engine load. As {{a matter of fact}} its mean value is low, but a passing torque can be four times higher than the rated torque. The second important component of propulsion engine operation is the time of ship acceleration from one speed to another. It determines dynamic properties of the ship describing its reductional feature. This time is determined in dependence on other parameters characterizing operation of ship propulsion plant and ship motion by means of dimensional analysis. These parameters were regarded as dimension quantities of three-dimensional space. Thus the three independent in dimension parameters can be noted in digital form in dimensional functions. The knowledge of operation parameters of ship propulsion plant and the knowledge of ship motion dynamics makes possible rational manoeuvring. It increases safety of ship motion and failure-free operation of ship propulsion engine. The proper operation of engine requires delivery to the propeller such amount of energy, which ensure the motion of ship with required speed in given sailing conditions...|$|E

40|$|Nanostructured {{metallic}} materials often possess extraordinary mechanical properties, {{and can be}} fabricated using two different approaches, bottom-up (i. e. electrodeposition, physical and chemical vapor deposition) and top-down approaches. The top-down approach (i. e. severe plastic deformation techniques) focuses on refining grain size of the existing coarse-grained materials through large straining to produce large bulk nanostructured solids. High-pressure torsion (HPT) has recently been proven as an effective technique to produce bulk materials with ultrafine-grained microstructures. In this study, a modified aluminum 2024 alloy (Al-Cu-Mg-Li alloy) was processed at first time by HPT under an applied pressure of 6. 0 GPa for a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> torsional <b>revolutions</b> from 1 / 4, 1 / 2, 1, 5 and 10 turns, and then exposed to a 3. 5 wt. % NaCl solution for open-circuit potential (OCP) measurements followed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization tests. The electrochemical results exhibit that corrosion resistance of Al-Cu-Mg-Li alloy in NaCl solution is significantly enhanced by 8 times upon high torsion strains of HPT processing {{compared with that of}} the as-received coarse-grained sample. Microhardness measurements also reveal a two-fold improvement in hardness for the Al-Cu-Mg-Li alloy after HPT processing.
