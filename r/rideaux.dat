5000|$|The {{designers}} of the French garden saw {{their work as}} a branch of architecture, which simply extended {{the space of the}} building to the space outside the walls, and ordered nature according to the rules of geometry, optics and perspective. Gardens were designed like buildings, with a succession of rooms which a visitor could pass through following an established route, hallways, and vestibules with adjoining chambers. They used the language of architecture in their plans; the spaces were referred to as salles, chambres and théâtres of greenery. The [...] "walls" [...] were composed of hedges, and [...] "stairways" [...] of water. On the ground were tapis, or carpets, of grass, brodés, or embroidered, with plants, and the trees were formed into <b>rideaux,</b> or curtains, along the alleys. Just as architects installed systems of water into the chateux, they laid out elaborate hydraulic systems to supply the fountains and basins of the garden. Long basins full of water replaced mirrors, and the water from fountains replaced chandeliers. In the bosquet du Marais in the gardens of Versailles, André Le Nôtre placed tables of white and red marble for serving meals. The flowing water in the basins and fountains imitated water pouring into carafes and crystal glasses. [...] The dominant role of architecture in the garden did not change until the 18th century, when the English garden arrived in Europe, and the inspiration for gardens began to come not from architecture but from romantic painting.|$|E

However, {{in the weekly}} paper Détective, edition number 79 dated 1 May 1930, there is an article {{entitled}} Vingt Ans dillusionnisme (20 Years of Conjuring). The article is written by Monsieur J. France {{who was one of}} the leading lights in the prosecution against Thérèse Humbert and who went to Madrid to take her back to Paris for trial. The story of the fraud is retold in the article following the death of Romain Daurignac, the brother of Thérèse. In this article, J. France says: Thérèse Humbert is still living, poorly, in Paris. She has lost her miraculous vitality. What a reverse of fortune her golden past has left her. She is a quite humble old lady, who never speaks to anyone." [...] (Thérése Humbert vit toujours, petitement, à Paris. Elle a perdu sa miraculeuse vitalité. Quels revers lui a laissés le passé dor? Cest une vieille femme assez humble, qui ne parle jamais.)

40|$|I {{can read}} Glas as an ancestral rite. More {{than half of}} the Hegel column {{discusses}} Hegel's work on the family, even in such early works as The Spirit of Christianity, where he suggests that the true pleroma of love and the family became possible with Christianity, the revealed religion of a Holy Family. He records Pompey's surprise that the crypt in the Jewish tabernacle was empty, that there was nothing behind the veil. Derrida has often dwelt on the power of the veil as an image in terms of truth as aletheia or unveiling, a notion sustained from Plato through Hegel and Heidegger. In Glas that image of Truth is associated with the Father. The words derriere les <b>rideaux</b> (behind the curtain or veil) remind Derrida of the name of his own father, recently deceased at the time of writing [80 b]. Hegel is himself a sort of father in this text: "To work in the name of Hegel, [ [...] . ] I have chosen to draw on [ [...] . ] the law of the family" [10 a]. And, in the passage from Glas quoted below, Derrida might be instructing the Christian father who wrote in The Spirit of Christianity that filial love does indeed inform the crypt derriere les <b>rideaux</b> (in the name of the Jewish father and behind the veil) in the tabernacle; he describes the whole undertaking of Glas in terms of that love: "In Algeria, {{in the middle of a}} mosque that the colonists had changed into a synagogue, the Torah, once out from derriere les <b>rideaux,</b> is carried about in the arms of a man or a child [ [...] . ]. Children who have watched the pomp of this celebration, especially those who were able to give a hand, perhaps dream of it long after, of arranging there all the bits of their life. What am I doing here? Let us say that I work at the origin of literature by miming it. Between the two" [268 b- 269 b]...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhen {{confronted with}} {{multiple}} moving objects the visual system can process them in two stages: an initial stage {{in which a}} limited number of signals are processed in parallel (i. e. simultaneously) followed by a sequential stage. We previously demonstrated that during the simultaneous stage, observers could discriminate between presentations containing up to 5 vs. 6 spatially localized motion signals (Edwards & <b>Rideaux,</b> 2013). Here we investigate what information is actually extracted during the simultaneous stage and whether the simultaneous limit varies with the detail of information extracted. This was achieved by measuring the ability of observers to extract varied information from low detail, i. e. the number of signals presented, to high detail, i. e. the actual directions present and the direction of a specific element, during the simultaneous stage. The results indicate that the resolution of simultaneous processing varies {{as a function of the}} information which is extracted, i. e. as the information extraction becomes more detailed, from the number of moving elements to the direction of a specific element, the capacity to process multiple signals is reduced. Thus, when assigning a capacity to simultaneous motion processing, this must be qualified by designating the degree of information extraction...|$|E
