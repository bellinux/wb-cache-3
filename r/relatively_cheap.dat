5|$|In the 1980s, {{a number}} of programs, such as the IAI Harpy or the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, {{integrated}} anti-radiation sensors into a drone or missile air frames coupled with command and control and loitering capabilities. This allowed the attacking force to place <b>relatively</b> <b>cheap</b> munitions in place over suspected SAM sites, and to attack promptly the moment the SAM battery is visible. This integrated {{the use of a}} drone as a baiting decoy with the attack role into one small and <b>relatively</b> <b>cheap</b> platform in comparison to the alternative wild weasel jet fighter.|$|E
5|$|In {{countries}} where its purchase is legal, BZP products are often produced in small specialist laboratories. The raw materials {{can be purchased}} from various chemical supply agencies and formed into tablets or capsules using <b>relatively</b> <b>cheap</b> production techniques. The resulting product can be marketed at extremely high markup, so end-user prices can {{be as high as}} 300 times the bulk cost of raw ingredients.|$|E
5|$|Other {{noble gases}} would be equally {{suitable}} {{for most of}} these applications, but argon {{is by far the}} cheapest. Argon is inexpensive, since it occurs naturally in air and is readily obtained as a byproduct of cryogenic air separation in the production of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen: the primary constituents of air are used on a large industrial scale. The other noble gases (except helium) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful by far. The bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and <b>relatively</b> <b>cheap.</b>|$|E

5|$|The US {{state of}} Oregon uses {{magnesium}} chloride, a <b>relatively</b> <b>cheap</b> chemical similar in snow-melting effects to sodium chloride, but less reactive, while New Zealand uses calcium magnesium acetate, which avoids the environmentally harmful chloride ion altogether. Urea is sometimes used to grit suspension bridges, {{as it does}} not corrode iron or steel at all, but urea is less effective than salt, and can cost up to 7 times more weight-for-weight.|$|E
5|$|Neoclassicism was {{pioneered by}} Gavin Hamilton and his proteges, the {{brothers}} John and Alexander Runciman, and David Allan. Alexander Runciman pioneered historical painting and Alan helped develop genre art, {{both of which}} would be taken up by Scottish artists in the next century. After the Acts of Union in 1707 there was very little patronage for large and expensive works of art in Scotland. With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public statuary and the portrait bust also became popular. Commissions of new statuary tended to be made in <b>relatively</b> <b>cheap</b> lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. From the late eighteenth century there are a handful of examples of work from Scottish artists.|$|E
5|$|As in England, {{commissions}} of new statuary {{tended to}} be made in <b>relatively</b> <b>cheap</b> lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The plasterwork of John Cheere's yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work from the yard of John Bacon (1740–99) who produced a monument for Robert Dundas (d. 1787) at Borthwick Church and one for Mrs Allardyce (d. 1787) at West Church, Aberdeen. Bacon was also a partner in Mrs Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory at Lambeth in London. This produced a buff coloured ceramic that could be moulded to provide fine detail, and be fired in sections, but was impervious to frost and fire. Much cheaper than carved stone, Coade stone was used for sphinxes, balustrading, capitals, coat of arms, tablets, ornamental vases, church monuments and fonts. It was used extensively by the Adam brothers, particularly in the houses they built in Scotland, such as Cullen, Banff, Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, Dunbar Castle, East Lothian, Register House, Edinburgh, Gosford House, East Lothian and Wedderburn, Berwickshire. As well as supplying sculpture, candelabra and cippi, the Adam family supplied designs to the Carron Company, founded in 1759, which produced a wide range of iron products, including stoves, safes, vases and tablets.|$|E

5|$|For {{symbolic}} memorials, numerous {{designs were}} possible, from simple monuments through to {{much more complex}} pieces of sculpture. Obelisks had been a popular memorial form in the 19th century and remained so in the inter-war years, including in Britain, France, Australia and Romania. One factor in this popularity was that obelisks were <b>relatively</b> <b>cheap</b> to build, while they also fitted well with the existing civic architecture in many towns. Memorial plaques were another popular memorial style around the world. Soldiers, either individually or in groups, were a popular sculptural feature in most countries, portrayed in various stances; typically these were allegorical, although in France {{the style of the}} soldier could also carry political meaning and reflect local political sympathies. Although the trend pre-dated the First World War, very few Western war memorials portrayed heroic commanding officers, as had been popular earlier in the 19th century; if soldiers were depicted, they were invariably ordinary soldiers, usually infantrymen. After the unveiling of the Cenotaph in London, it became a popular design in many other locations in Britain and Australia too.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century the {{development}} of the Grand Tour took young Scottish aristocrats to the continent, particularly Rome, which was home to the exiled Jacobite Stuarts. This in turn fuelled interest in classical and Renaissance styles, and the buying of artistic works, particularly sculptures. However, the only major Scottish collection of marble before the nineteenth century was that of James Johnstone, 2nd Marquess of Annandale. As in England, commissions of new statuary tended to be crafted in <b>relatively</b> <b>cheap</b> lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The plasterwork of John Cheere's yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work from the yard of John Bacon (1740–99). Bacon was also a partner in Mrs Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory at Lambeth in London. This produced a buff coloured ceramic that could be moulded to provide fine detail, and be fired in sections, but was impervious to frost and fire. Much cheaper than carved stone, Coadstone was used for sphinxes, balustrading, capitals, coats of arms, tablets and ornamental vases. It was used extensively by the Adam brothers, particularly in the houses they built in Scotland, such as Cullen, Banff, Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, Dunbar Castle, East Lothian, Gosford House, East Lothian and Wedderburn, Berwickshire. They also supplied sculpture, candelabra and cippi that made up the neo-classical Adam Style.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{altering}} cloud precipitation {{can be done}} with the use of dry ice. It was widely used in experiments in the US in the 1950s and early 60s before it was replaced by silver iodide. Dry ice has the advantage of being <b>relatively</b> <b>cheap</b> and completely non-toxic. Its main drawback is the need to be delivered directly into the supercooled region of clouds being seeded.|$|E
25|$|An {{example that}} {{combines}} features above {{is a country}} that specializes in the production of high-tech knowledge products, as developed countries do, and trades with developing nations for goods produced in factories where labour is <b>relatively</b> <b>cheap</b> and plentiful, resulting in different in opportunity costs of production. More total output and utility thereby results from specializing in production and trading than if each country produced its own high-tech and low-tech products.|$|E
25|$|However, as the {{adoption}} of electric cars, such as the French Renault Fluence Z.E., over internal combustion engine vehicles increases, reducing fossil fuel dependence, France's comparatively cheap peak and off peak electricity prices could act as a strong customer incentive that may spur the speed of {{the adoption}} of electric vehicles, essentially turning the current perceived glut of <b>relatively</b> <b>cheap</b> fission-electricity into an asset, as demand for electric vehicle recharging stations becomes more and more commonplace.|$|E
