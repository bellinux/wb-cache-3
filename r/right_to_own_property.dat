5|$|Girls had equal {{inheritance}} {{rights with}} boys if their father died without leaving a will. A Roman mother's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property</b> and {{to dispose of}} it as she saw fit, including setting the terms of her own will, gave her enormous influence over her sons {{even when they were}} adults.|$|E
5|$|The feminist {{movement}} has effected change in Western society, including women's suffrage; {{greater access to}} education; more nearly equitable pay with men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion); and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Toubou people, states Jean Chapelle, {{have been}} {{socially}} stratified with an embedded caste system. The three strata have {{consisted of the}} freemen with a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property,</b> the artisanal castes and the slaves.|$|E
50|$|In many {{countries}} women have {{limited access to}} property following restrictive inheritance and family laws, under which only men have actual or formal <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property.</b>|$|R
50|$|Women's {{rights were}} also greatly {{expanded}} {{in the new}} constitution. Married women were granted the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> private <b>property,</b> and also granted the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> jointly <b>own</b> <b>property</b> with her husband.|$|R
30|$|Women in Borana society {{traditionally}} did {{not have}} the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property</b> or control over their reproductive labour; if they had any, it was only indirectly, by virtue of being married to a wealthy herd-owning man.|$|R
25|$|The {{job of a}} priestess, {{especially}} the Pythia, was a respectable career for Greek women. Priestesses enjoyed many liberties and rewards for their social position, such as freedom from taxation, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property</b> and attend public events, a salary and housing provided by the state, {{a wide range of}} duties depending on their affiliation, and often gold crowns.|$|E
25|$|Roman {{women had}} a limited form of citizenship. Though held in high regard {{they were not}} allowed to vote or stand for civil or public office. The rich might {{participate}} in public life by funding building projects or sponsoring religious ceremonies and other events. Women had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property,</b> to engage in business, and to obtain a divorce, but their legal rights varied over time. Marriages were an important form of political alliance during the Republic.|$|E
25|$|Slave {{women under}} sharia {{did not have}} a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property</b> or to move freely. Sharia, in Islam's history, {{provided}} a religious foundation for enslaving non-Muslim women (and men), but allowed for the manumission of slaves. However, manumission required that the non-Muslim slave first convert to Islam. A non-Muslim slave woman who bore children to her Muslim master became legally free upon her master's death, and her children were presumed to be Muslims like their father, in Africa and elsewhere.|$|E

5000|$|Another issue delegates {{considered}} {{was that}} of women’s rights. Clarina Nichols, social activist and associated editor of Quindaro Chindowan, an abolitionist newspaper, was asked to address the convention. As {{a result of her}} efforts, women gained the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property</b> and <b>to</b> participate in school district elections. In addition, the constitution assured that the state would provide for women’s equal rights “in the possession of their children.” ...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{articles}} of the 1917 Constitution were at issue: a) Article 5 (outlawing monastic religious orders); b) Article 24 (forbidding public worship outside of church buildings); and c) Article 27 (restricting religious organizations' <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property).</b> Finally, Article 130 took away basic civil rights of the clergy: priests and religious leaders were prevented from wearing their habits, were denied the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> vote, and were not permitted to comment on public affairs in the press.|$|R
25|$|Slave {{women under}} sharia {{did not have}} a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property,</b> right to free {{movement}} or right to consent. Sharia, in Islam's history, provided religious foundation for enslaving non-Muslim women (and men), as well as encouraged slave's manumission. However, manumission required that the non-Muslim slave first convert to Islam. Non-Muslim slave women who bore children to their Muslim masters became legally free upon her master's death, and her children were presumed to be Muslims as their father, in Africa, and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1840s, the {{population}} of Wisconsin Territory had exceeded 150,000, {{more than twice the}} number of people required for Wisconsin to become a state. In 1846, the territorial legislature voted to apply for statehood. That fall, 124 delegates debated the state constitution. The document produced by this convention was considered extremely progressive for its time. It banned commercial banking, granted married women the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property,</b> and left the question of African-American suffrage to a popular vote. Most Wisconsinites considered the first constitution to be too radical, however, and voted it down in an April 1847 referendum.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, D.C. Agenda {{proposed}} {{creating a}} nonprofit, tax-exempt, public-private economic development corporation. The organization, dominated by private developers, would have broad power (including eminent domain and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property)</b> to direct planning {{and engage in}} redevelopment of the city's downtown and business corridors. The proposal asked for $50 million in cash {{from the federal government}} (with 40 percent earmarked for redevelopment efforts by other nonprofits), and $250 million in redistributable tax credits and surplus federal property. The D.C. Agenda proposal became the National Capital Revitalization Corp., which was created by law adopted by the Council of the District of Columbia in April 1998.|$|E
25|$|Abolitionists also {{attacked}} slavery as {{a threat}} to the freedom of white Americans. Defining freedom as more than a simple lack of restraint, antebellum reformers held that the truly free man was one who imposed restraints upon himself. Thus, for the anti-slavery reformers of the 1830s and 1840s, the promise of free labor and upward social mobility (opportunities for advancement, <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property,</b> and <b>to</b> control one's <b>own</b> labor), was central to the ideal of reforming individuals.|$|R
50|$|Notwithstanding, the {{statutes}} {{of the university}} and the college grant the university separate corporate legal <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property,</b> borrow money, employ staff, and also enable it to sue and be sued as occurred in the case referred to above. To date the other rights have not been exercised. Current Officers of the University are either unpaid and purely honorary (Chancellor, Pro-Chancellor), or have duties relating to the college also, for which they are paid, but by the College (The Proctors, The Registrar, the Mace bearer).|$|R
5000|$|Property {{rights are}} also {{distinguished}} from personal rights. Practically all contemporary societies acknowledge this basic ontological and ethical distinction. In the past, groups lacking political power {{have often been}} disqualified from the benefits of property. In an extreme form, this has meant that people have become [...] "objects" [...] of property—legally [...] "things" [...] or chattels (see slavery.) More commonly, marginalized groups have been denied legal <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property.</b> These include Jews in England and married women in Western societies until the late 19th century.|$|R
25|$|Like {{most of the}} Southern {{members of}} Congress, Jefferson and Madison also opposed a second of the three {{proposals}} of Hamilton: establishing an official government Mint. They believed this centralization of power away from local banks was dangerous to a sound monetary system and was mostly {{to the benefit of}} business interests in the commercial north, not southern agricultural interests, arguing that the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property</b> would be infringed by these proposals. Furthermore, they contended that the creation of such a bank violated the Constitution, which specifically stated that congress was to regulate weights and measures and issue coined money (rather than mint and bills of credit).|$|E
25|$|Until the 20th century, Islamic law granted Muslim women certain legal rights, {{such as the}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property</b> {{received}} as Mahr (brideprice) at her marriage. However, Islamic law does not grant non-Muslim women the same legal rights as the few it did grant Muslim women. Sharia recognizes the basic inequality between master and women slave, between free women and slave women, between Believers and non-Believers, {{as well as their}} unequal rights. Sharia authorized the institution of slavery, using the words abd (slave) and the phrase ma malakat aymanukum ("that which your right hand owns") to refer to women slaves, seized as captives of war. Under Islamic law, Muslim men could have sexual relations with female captives and slaves.|$|E
25|$|California {{women had}} the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property</b> {{in their own}} name since the first California Constitution in 1850. In 1911 California voters, in a special election, {{narrowly}} granted women the right to vote, nine years before the 19th Amendment enfranchised women nationally in 1920, but over 41 years later than the women of Wyoming had been granted the right to vote. Women's clubs flourished and turned a spotlight {{on issues such as}} public schools, dirt and pollution, and public health. California women were leaders in the temperance movement, moral reform, conservation, public schools, recreation, and other issues. They helped pass the 18th amendment, which established Prohibition in 1920. Initially, women did not often run for public office.|$|E
5000|$|Contemporary {{political}} thinkers {{who believe}} that natural persons enjoy <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property</b> and <b>to</b> enter into contracts espouse two views about John Locke. On the one hand, some admire Locke, such as W.H. Hutt (1956), who praised Locke for laying down the [...] "quintessence of individualism". On the other hand, those such as Richard Pipes regard Locke's arguments as weak, and think that undue reliance thereon has weakened the cause of individualism in recent times. Pipes has written that Locke's work [...] "marked a regression because it rested {{on the concept of}} Natural Law" [...] rather than upon Harrington's sociological framework.|$|R
5000|$|The {{government}} {{is responsible for}} protecting the rights and freedoms of all citizens. These include the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> life; freedoms of religion, speech, assembly, association and movement; the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> private <b>property,</b> and equality before the law.|$|R
2500|$|Some libertarian {{critics of}} {{intellectual}} property have argued that allowing property rights in ideas and information creates artificial scarcity and infringes on the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> tangible <b>property.</b> Stephan Kinsella uses the following scenario to argue this point: ...|$|R
25|$|Until the 20th century, Islamic law granted Muslim women certain legal rights, {{such as the}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property</b> {{received}} as Mahr (brideprice) at her marriage, that Western legal systems did not grant to women.

25|$|Until {{the passing}} of the Married Women's Property Act in 1870 a wife had no {{independent}} existence under English law, and therefore no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property</b> or to enter into contracts separately from her husband, or to sue for divorce, or for the control and custody of her children. Helen is misled by ideas of romantic love and duty into the delusion that she can repair her husband's conduct. Hattersley declares that he wants a pliant wife who will not interfere with his fun, {{but the truth is that}} he really wants quite the opposite. Milicent cannot resist her mother's pressure, so she marries Ralph against her will. Wealthy Annabella wants only a title, while Lord Lowborough truly and devotedly loves her. The social climber Jane Wilson seeks wealth.|$|E
500|$|Dieter Langewiesche {{described}} the code as a [...] "revolutionary project" [...] which spurred {{the development of}} bourgeois society in Germany by {{the extension of the}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property</b> and an acceleration towards the end of feudalism. Napoleon reorganised what had been the Holy Roman Empire, made up of more than a thousand entities, [...] into a more streamlined forty-state Confederation of the Rhine; this provided the basis for the German Confederation and the unification of Germany in 1871.|$|E
40|$|At the {{international}} level, Canada {{has in the}} past played an important role as an advocate for the recognition of access to adequate housing as a fundamental human right. Canada ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) in 1976 and played a leading role in promoting the adoption and ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in 1989, both of which contain explicit recognition of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> adequate housing.

500|$|The 1855 {{legislature}} {{passed a}} wide variety of reform legislation, most of which Gardner signed. [...] A board of insurance with broad powers of inspection was created; bankruptcy laws were changed to benefit lower-class individuals; imprisonment for debt was abolished. [...] Vaccinations were mandated for all school children, women were given the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property</b> on their own, and exempted from responsibility for their husbands' debts; and restrictions were placed on child labor. [...] Schools were desegregated, a reform school for girls was established, and state funding was withdrawn from parochial schools. [...] Cities and towns were authorized to engage in {{a wide variety}} of civic improvements, including the building of highways, gas, water, and sewer lines, and public transport facilities such as docks and wharves. [...] One of the major reforms that was not enacted, despite vigorous debate, was legislation calling for a ten-hour workday.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property</b> {{does not}} mean {{absolute}} freedom {{in the use of}} money, but carries responsibilities with it.

[...] But they have a responsibility to give alms from what is left over. This is not a law, but a moral obligation.|$|E
2500|$|The large {{influx of}} Sudanese {{refugees}} in Egypt {{beginning in the}} late 1990s led to an increase in rent prices and a higher cost of living for refugees as well as social tensions between the natives and Sudanese not experienced during the past influxes in the 1980s. [...] The increased rent prices burdened the Sudanese refugees particularly because they must pay for more expensive furnished flats, unlike natives who have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property.</b>|$|E
25|$|Back in Mexico, a new {{constitution}} for the country had been signed (1917). Five articles of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico were particularly aimed at suppression of the Catholic Church. Article 3 mandated secular education in schools, prohibiting the Church from participating in primary and secondary education. Article 5 outlawed monastic religious orders. Article 24 forbade public worship outside of church buildings, while Article 27 restricted religious organizations' <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property.</b> Finally, Article 130 revoked basic civil rights of clergy members: priests and religious workers were prevented from wearing their habits, were denied the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> vote, and were forbidden from commenting on public affairs to the press. Most of the anti-clerical provisions of the constitution were removed in 1998.|$|R
50|$|By {{the last}} decade of the nineteenth century, Kentucky was the only state in which {{marriage}} effectively denied women of their basic human and civil rights. The Married Woman's Property Act, also called the Husband and Wife Bill during the years under debate when the draft was castigated as anti-family and infringing on cultural norms about women's honor as ladies, passed in 1894. Though the Kentucky General Assembly narrowly constructed the bill to give married women the some general <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> <b>property</b> in Kentucky, this was an important milestone in the campaign for women's rights, including the franchise. Henry saw this as critical for the establishment of women's economic independence and the self-efficacy needed for an informed citizenry to vote in a constructive way.|$|R
