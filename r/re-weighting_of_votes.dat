Most of the research on reform efforts has focused on increasing transparency and on facilitating the management of various auxiliary bodies of the Council. In addition, a central focus has been placed on <b>re-weighting</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> among the member states. In this article we argue that the current method of finding agree-ment and avoiding votes in the Council (‘culture of consen-sus’) will be impracticable with enlarged membership. Hence, formalized voting procedures will be needed. We discuss some desiderata of such procedures...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} and compares results for {{three types of}} connectionist networks on perceptual learning tasks: [A] Multi-layered converging networks of neuron-like units, with each unit connected to a small randomly chosen subset of units in the adjacent layers, that learn by <b>re-weighting</b> <b>of</b> their links; [B] Networks of neuron-like units structured into successively larger modules under brain-like topological constraints (such as layered, converging-diverging hierarchies and local receptive fields) that learn by <b>re-weighting</b> <b>of</b> their links; [C] Networks with brain-like structures that learn by generation-discovery, which involves the growth of links and recruiting of units in addition to reweighting of links. Preliminary empirical results from simulation of these networks for perceptual recognition tasks show significant improvements in learning from using brain-like structures (e. g., local receptive fields, global convergence) over networks that lack such structure; further improvements in learning result {{from the use of}} generation in addition to reweighting of links...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between two widely used risk measures, the spectral measures and the distortion risk measures. In both cases, the risk measure can be thought <b>of</b> as a <b>re-weighting</b> <b>of</b> some initial distribution. We prove that spectral risk measures are equivalent to distorted risk pricing measures, or equivalently, spectral risk functions are related to distortion functions. Besides that we prove that distorted measures are absolutely continuous {{with respect to the}} original measure. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{these questions}} using a systems {{analysis of the}} perceptual system {{during the course of}} perceptual learning using psychophysical methods and models of the observer. Effects of perceptual learning on an observer’s performance are characterized by external noise tests within the framework of noisy observer models. We find evidence that two independent mechanisms, external noise exclusion and stimulus enhancement support perceptual learning across a range of tasks. We suggest that both mechanisms may reflect <b>re-weighting</b> <b>of</b> stable early sensory representations...|$|R

30|$|Random walk (RW) based methods [27, 28], in contrast, allow node re-visiting and {{are widely}} adopted {{due to their}} {{simplicity}} and efficiency. The node selection in an RW based method is inherently biased towards high degree nodes [27]. Such bias can be quantified by classic Markov Chain analysis and can be adjusted via <b>re-weighting</b> <b>of</b> the estimators [29]. To sample nodes with different desired properties, such as node attribute stratification, RW can be modified by using the Metropolis filter, known as Metropolis-Hasting Random Walk (MHRW) [28], to achieve a desired stationary distribution.|$|R
30|$|The {{restoration}} results {{presented in}} [12], {{and more recently}} in [27], showed {{the effectiveness of the}} multiscale approach in implementing blind image deconvolution algorithms. Furthermore, it is shown in [27] that the multi-scale approach prevents the algorithm from converging to the unit impulse. Alternatively, the authors in [13, 14] introduced heuristic <b>re-weighting</b> <b>of</b> the regularization parameters, at each iteration, to prevent the algorithms from converging to unrealistic blur estimates. In our study, no heuristic adjustment of each parameter is performed but instead we estimate the parameters automatically within the Bayesian framework.|$|R

This paper presents a new RF method for keyword queries (content queries). It is based on the <b>re-weighting</b> <b>of</b> the original query terms plus the addition of new query terms from the content of elements jugded as relevant or non-relevant by the user. This RF method is integrated in our search engine, Garnata, and evaluated with the INEX 2007 collection. ...|$|R

The estimator is derived by solving the Limber equation for a <b>re-weighting</b> <b>of</b> the foreground tracer that nulls either clustering or lensing {{contributions to the}} cross-correlation function.

40|$|The Hulliger’s robust {{estimation}} technique consists in the <b>re-weighting</b> <b>of</b> units identified as outliers through a Robustified Ratio Estimator (RRE), {{according to which}} outliers contribute to the final estimate with a sample weight reduced {{with respect to the}} original one. Outlier observations are identified through a standardised function founded on the difference between observed and expected values. A crucial aspect concerns the choice of the acceptation threshold, which plays a role in the re-weighting process as well. In this context, we propose some potential improvements of the RRE, concerning the use of an objective criterion for fixing the threshold and the <b>re-weighting</b> rules. Results <b>of</b> two empirical attempts based on real data derived from longitudinal surveys show that, in the most part of case studies, the proposed changes contribute to improve efficiency of estimates with respect to the ordinary ratio estimator...|$|R

40|$|The Blue Moon {{ensemble}} is a computationally efficient {{molecular dynamics}} method {{to estimate the}} rate constants of rare activated events when the process can be described by a reaction coordinate xi(r), a well-defined function in configuration space. By means of holonomic constraints a number of values of (r) can be prescribed along the relevant path to identify the bottleneck region first and to sample an ensemble of starting conditions to generate activated trajectories. These MD trajectories sample phase space according to a biased configurational distribution. With a suitable <b>re-weighting</b> <b>of</b> averages from such ensemble of trajectories one can characterize completely rare events...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUsing the {{external}} noise plus training paradigm, we have consistently found that two independent mechanisms, stimulus enhancement and external noise exclusion, support perceptual learning {{in a range}} of tasks. Here, we show that <b>re-weighting</b> <b>of</b> stable early sensory representations through Hebbian learning (Petrov et al., 2005, 2006) can generate performance patterns that parallel a large range of empirical data: (1) perceptual learning reduced contrast thresholds at all levels of external noise in peripheral orientation identification (Dosher & Lu, 1998, 1999), (2) training with low noise exemplars transferred to performance in high noise, while training with exemplars embedded in high external noise transferred little to performance in low noise (Dosher & Lu, 2005), and (3) pre-training in high external noise only reduced subsequent learning in high external noise, whereas pre-training in zero external noise left very little additional learning in all {{the external}} noise conditions (Lu et al., 2006). In the augmented Hebbian re-weighting model (AHRM), perceptual learning strengthens or maintains the connections between the most closely tuned visual channels and a learned categorization structure, while it prunes or reduces inputs from task-irrelevant channels. Reducing the weights on irrelevant channels reduces the contributions of external noise and additive internal noise. Manifestation of stimulus enhancement or external noise exclusion depends on the initial state of internal noise and connection weights in the beginning of a learning task. Both mechanisms reflect <b>re-weighting</b> <b>of</b> stable early sensory representations...|$|R

Our results show that sway coordination and amplitude both change with age, but that changes in overall feedback gains do not explain these differences. We propose that increased sway of elderly subjects in platform sway-referenced conditions is due to sensory noise or decreased ability to detect small motions of the platform, while increased sway during visual sway-referencing is due to <b>re-weighting</b> <b>of</b> the various sensors. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} is presented for constructing an approximate numerical {{solution to a}} large scale Lyapunov equation in low rank factored form. The {{algorithm is}} based upon a synthesis of an approximate power method and an alternating direction implicit (ADI) method. The former is parameter free and tends to be efficient in practice, {{but there is little}} theoretical understanding of its convergence properties. The ADI method has a well understood convergence theory, but the method relies upon selection of shift parameters and a poor shift selection can lead to very slow convergence in practice. The algorithm presented here uses an approximate power method iteration to obtain a basis update. It then constructs a <b>re-weighting</b> <b>of</b> this basis update to provide a factorization update that satisfies ADI-like convergence properties. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{relates to}} the use of risk measures for determining (re) insurers’ economic capital requirements. Alternative sets of properties of risk measures are discussed. Furthermore, methods for constructing risk measures via indifference arguments, representation results and <b>re-weighting</b> <b>of</b> probability distributions are presented. It is shown how these different approaches relate to popular risk measures, such as VaR, Expected Shortfall, distortion risk measures and the exponential premium principle. The problem of allocating aggregate economic capital to sub-portfolios (e. g. insurers’ lines of business) is then considered, with particular emphasis on marginal-cost-type methods. The relationship between insurance pricing and capital allocation is briefly discussed, based on concepts such as the opportunity and frictional costs of capital and the impact of the potential of default on insurance rates...|$|R

Subjects wore a head-mounted display and rode a stationary bike along a straight path in an empty, seemingly infinite hallway with random surface texture. Subjects traversed a standard distance and a comparison distance and judged {{which of the}} two was longer. The relation between visual and proprioceptive cues was made incongruent by changing the optic flow gain (OFG). Results indicate that relative cue-weighting was affected by the frequency with which the cue-relations were varied. Specifically, an approximately equal weighting of cues was observed for low OFG variability, whereas a visually dominated response was observed for high OFG variability. This suggests that a dynamic <b>re-weighting</b> <b>of</b> cues occurs in response to the recent history of cue-relations.
