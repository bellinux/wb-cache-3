On 28 August 1914 she was present, but played no significant role, in the Battle of Heligoland Bight, Several months later, the Germans bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 16 December and the 1st LCS was escorting Vice-Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers in <b>response</b> <b>when</b> it encountered a German light cruiser and a half-flotilla of torpedo boats. Falmouth was not in range to engage before the squadron turned away to follow the battlecruisers. On 28 December, the ship was transferred to the 3rd LCS and became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Trevylyan Napier, the squadron commander. During the Battle of Dogger Bank on 24 January 1915, the squadron escorted the Grand Fleet, but was not engaged. After the battle was over, the squadron escorted the battlecruisers on their way back to Cromarty, Scotland.|$|E
5|$|So far, the {{investigation}} {{had been on}} the natural frequency of transient oscillation of a resonant circuit resulting from a sudden stimulus. More important {{from the point of view}} of filter theory is the behaviour of a resonant circuit when driven by an external AC signal: there is a sudden peak in the circuit's <b>response</b> <b>when</b> the driving signal frequency is at the resonant frequency of the circuit. James Clerk Maxwell heard of the phenomenon from Sir William Grove in 1868 in connection with experiments on dynamos, and was also aware of the earlier work of Henry Wilde in 1866. Maxwell explained resonance mathematically, with a set of differential equations, in much the same terms that an RLC circuit is described today.|$|E

The latency delay between commands issued and game <b>response</b> <b>when</b> played online is greatly reduced when playing over a LAN and this allows for much finer control over in-game units; there were concerns that a professional scene would not develop as a result. Over 250,000 fans signed a petition asking Blizzard to add LAN play to StarCraft II, before the game's release. Currently, Blizzard {{has no plans to}} support LAN play. Although it does not change the routing of the game through Blizzard's servers, a Players Near You feature was added in StarCraft II patch 2.0.4, to help with organizing games with other players on the same local network.|$|E

5|$|The final {{decades of}} this era saw a {{worsening}} economic situation for many Plebeians. The long military campaigns had forced citizens {{to leave their}} farms, which often caused those farms to fall {{into a state of}} disrepair. This situation was made worse during the Second Punic War, when Hannibal fought the Romans throughout Italy, and the Romans adopted a strategy of attrition and guerrilla warfare in <b>response.</b> <b>When</b> the soldiers returned from the battlefield, they often had to sell their farms to pay their debts, and the landed aristocracy quickly bought these farms at discounted prices. The wars had also brought to Rome a great surplus of inexpensive slave labor, which the landed aristocrats used to staff their new farms. Soon the masses of unemployed Plebeians began to flood into Rome, and into the ranks of the legislative assemblies.|$|E

As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no <b>response</b> <b>when</b> Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.|$|E

25|$|Rheobase can be best {{understood}} {{in the context of}} the strength-duration relationship (Fig. 1). The ease with which a membrane can be stimulated depends on two variables: the strength of the stimulus, and the duration for which the stimulus is applied. These variables are inversely related: as the strength of the applied current increases, the time required to stimulate the membrane decreases (and vice versa) to maintain a constant effect. Mathematically, rheobase is equivalent to half the current that needs to be applied for the duration of chronaxie, which is a strength-duration time constant that corresponds to the duration of time that elicits a <b>response</b> <b>when</b> the nerve is stimulated at twice rheobasic strength.|$|E

25|$|Nests {{represent}} a highly concentrated supply of resources, {{which makes them}} desirable to predators. P. colobopterus wasps have a nonaggressive <b>response</b> <b>when</b> their nest is disturbed. After the initial provocation, wasps leave the nest and begin vigorous displays on its outer envelope. If the provocation continues, females will abandon the nest entirely, leaving the offspring behind. This unique behavior is particularly interesting because the females possess stings {{that could be used}} in colony defense. However, field observations indicate females will only sting in self-defense if directly attacked. There have been several theories proposed for the defense response of P. colobopterus, but it seems most likely that this response is due to the lack of vertebrate predation. Furthermore, the nests of these wasps are camouflaged by plant matter, which may further reduce the likelihood of vertebrate predation and negate the need for aggressive defense.|$|E
25|$|When {{either side}} of the {{transformer}} is a tuned circuit, the amount of mutual inductance between the two windings, together with the Q factor of the circuit, determine the shape of the frequency response curve. The tuned circuit together with the transformer load form an RLC circuit with a definite peak in the frequency <b>response.</b> <b>When</b> both sides of the transformer are tuned, it is described as double-tuned. The coupling of double-tuned circuits is described as loose-, critical-, or over-coupled depending on the value of k. When two tuned circuits are loosely coupled through mutual inductance, the bandwidth will be narrow. As the amount of mutual inductance increases, the bandwidth continues to grow. When the mutual inductance is increased beyond a critical point, the peak in the response curve begins to drop, and the center frequency will be attenuated more strongly than its direct sidebands. This is known as overcoupling.|$|E
