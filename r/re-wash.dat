50|$|Before {{the formal}} 1971 Oregon Bottle Bill, Oregon had already {{set up a}} less formal bottle return system that most stores {{and some of the}} public cooperated with. Inspired by the early Vermont bottle return system before it was repealed, Oregon's limited system paid 1 cent for beer bottles and cans and 3 cents for soda bottles and cans, and was started in the mid-1950s, and lasted {{through the rest of the}} 50s, {{throughout}} the 1960s and into the early 70s until the more formal and expanded Bottle Bill was enacted. The emphasis was on bottles, as bottlers were washed and re-used for fresh product sold to the public before health laws were enacted that stopped the <b>re-wash</b> system. And because of the low payout for the return of bottles and cans, and in spite of various anti-litter PSA advertising campaigns on Oregon television, only a relatively small percentage of Oregonians participated in the return of bottles and cans, and thus many bottles and cans still littered Oregon's highways and scenic areas throughout this entire early bottle-can recycling period.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine if the soils and waters of Puertollano area are {{affected}} by pollution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their quantification. The results show that PAHs concentrations are higher in all samples than the reference levels gathered in the Spanish legislation. The possible actions for the coal waste remediation (<b>re-wash</b> of waste dumps, photodegradation and biorremediation) seems to be unviable in this case because of the large volume of materials affected, the slowness of these processes, and the geomorphological characteristics of the carboniferous Puertollano basin. During the spatial regional planning, maps showing the concentration of PAHs should be made to adapt the soil for its corresponding use. It is proposed to consider as contaminants more PAHs, such as naftalene or fluorantene in waters, and phenanthrene and benzo[ghi] perilene in soils...|$|E
40|$|The {{process control}} in a concentrating plant appears like {{a problem of}} imponderable from the moment that the gross mineral falls to the tubes of the mill, the process is {{continuous}} and this continuity only stops when the product finally emerges {{to rest in the}} fields of storage of the concentrates and the fields of <b>re-wash</b> of the tails. The material in process cannot be weighed without interrupting such continuity; consequently, the control of the plant will depend much on the suitable sampling of the treated material that is like pulp. From these samples the essential and useful information of the analysis will be obtained, as far as the content of the metal, distribution as large as particles and water Content or other ingredients of the mineral pulp. With such information by hand, we can calculate the efficiency and the effectiveness of the work that takes place by means of the use of formulas and tabulations. But by the tedious that is the work to obtain information of the fact, more than everything by delay of the tests in laboratory, so, decisions cannot be taken right away to improve the production process. in the present work a methodology of process control, sets out called “cebaco” that consists basically of three parts main, first, the control method that set out, these are the operative variables in the circuit of milling-classification in a concentrating plant that is based on a humid malla in the same site of sampling, for which 2 are only needed, these can be No. 60 and 200 that are the most recommendable and also to have a Densimeter (balance MARCY) with their respective monogram, we can weight pulp of 1 litro of Capacity, knowing the mineral specific gravity, the pulp density with these data the solids percentage can be calculated in an instant in each flow of the filing cabinet, and with this data it calculates the negative accumulated percentage and positive of you enmesh mentioned, with these data collected using the mathematical models Gaudin-Schuhmann[64] and Rosin-Rammler [61], but used in mineral processing, with which the grain sized profiles are obtained almost right away and in an instant, the second contribution is the proposal of the mathematical model that is based on the density of the pulp taken these on each flow from the filing cabinet and of the density obtained when doing the humid mallaje respectively in you enmesh already mentioned; and the third party is I elaboration of software Goliat 0, 2 in the programming language LabVIEW with the mathematical models that sets out where the obtained results is possible to be visualized in a computer. The tests of application and verification were realized, in Plants Concentrating of “Austria Duvaz” in Morococha, “Crown” of Chumpe in Yauricocha, Yauyos and “Huari” located in UNCP. Whish results were very flattering, agreeing almost in total with the proposition hypothesis. Like demonstration of which the methodology works optimally, as much in the process control like in the simulation, we can verify with the following obtained results, the size of cuts (d 50) calculated [51]; with the data taken from the book of Juan Rivera Zevallos[58] in pages 307 - 324, is 77, 31 microns and the classification efficiency is of 42, 32 and making the calculations with the methodology, it gives that d 50 is 77, 32 microns and the classification efficiency gives a value of 42, 71, is possible to be clearly noticed that almost there is no difference, In the second case in the comparison {{of the results of the}} data collected in the concentrating plant of “Chumpe” Yauricocha, when doing the process control and the respective calculations by the traditional methodology, as it is realized in the majority of the plants, it gives a value of d 50 of 81, 31 microns and the classification efficiency gives a value of 57, 93 % and when doing the control and its respective calculations with the methodology “Cebaco” give as result d 50 of 83, 56 microns and the efficiency of classification of 53, 18 % can also be noticed mainly in this completes that the difference is not significant, being the level of significance of 0. 08 and with a approximation of 92 %, in the third case also when evaluating another test of the data taken from the concentrating plant mentioned when doing the calculations with the traditional method, it gives an efficiency of classification of 48, 49 % and with the methodology “Cebaco” the classification efficiency is about 48, 02 %, also almost are similar, in the fourth case when doing the evaluation of the results obtained in the concentrating plant “Austria located Duvaz” in Morococha, the d 50 calculated by the traditional methodology gives a value of 88, 3061 and d 50 calculated with the methodology “Cebaco” gives a value of 85, 2559 existing a difference of so only 3, 45 and the value of the efficiency of classification by the traditional methodology gives a value of 51, 8102 and the calculated with the methodology “Cebaco” gives a value of 51, 6255 existing an insignificant difference of 0, 36 and the reason of circulating load calculated by the traditional methodology gives a value of 1. 903 and the calculated one with the methodology “Cebaco” gives a value of 1, 887 whose difference is of so only 0. 84. So, the demonstration more important, where it is verified that the method “Cebaco” is an suitable proposal, occurs with the increase of the utility for the concentrating plant and this was obtained from valuations of the concentrates in both cases, first with the obtained metallurgical balance with the traditional method and the other with the metallurgical balance obtained of the works carried out with the proposed method, this is based on a better time of control, as for the time with the traditional method in the best cases is of 4 hours and with the proposed method is of so only 5 minutes, this implies that the corrections are made right away and in an instant, so it brings consequently theimprovement of the recoveries laws of the concentrates and therefore increase of the productivity. By the calculations done I determine a utility of 11. 53 dollars American more by ton of mineral treated, when realizing the control with the proposed method. El control de procesos en una planta concentradora se presenta como un problema desde el mismo momento que el mineral bruto cae a las trompas del molino, el proceso es continuo y solo cesa esta continuidad cuando el producto finalmente emerge para descansar en las canchas de almacenamiento de los concentrados y las canchas de relave de las colas. El material en proceso no puede ser pesado sin interrumpir tal continuidad; consecuentemente, el control de la planta dependerá mucho del muestreo adecuado del material tratado que se encuentra en forma de pulpa. De estas muestras se obtendrá la información esencial y útil por medio del análisis, en cuanto al contenido del metal, distribución del tamaño de partículas y contenido de agua u otros ingredientes en la pulpa del mineral. Con tal información a mano, se cálcula la eficiencia y por ende la efectividad del trabajo que se efectúa mediante el uso de fórmulas y tabulaciones. Pero por lo tedioso que es el trabajo de obtener información de los datos, más que todo por la demora de las pruebas en laboratorio, y por lo tanto no se pueden tomar decisiones al instante para mejorar el proceso de producción. En el presente trabajo se propone una metodología de control de procesos llamado “Cebaco”que consiste básicamente de tres partes pricipales, primero, el diseño de el método de control del proceso que se propone, el control de las variables operativas en el circuito de molienda-clasificación en una planta concentradora que se fundamenta en un mallaje en húmedo en el mismo sitio de muestreo, para la cual solamente se necesitan 2 mallas, éstas pueden ser las No. 60 y 200 que son los más recomendables y también contar con un densímetro (balanza MARCY) con su respectivo nomograma, un pesapulpa de 1 litro de capacidad, conociendo la gravedad específica del mineral, la densidad de la pulpa con estos datos se puede calcular al instante el porcentaje de sólidos en cada flujo del clasificador, y con lo cual se cálcula los porcentajes acumulados negativos y positivos de las mallas mencionadas, con dichos datos obtenidos utilizando los modelos matemáticos de Gaudín-Schuhmann[64] y de Rosín-Rammler[61], los más usados en procesamiento de minerales, con los cuales se obtienen los perfiles granulométricos casi al instante, el segundo aporte es la elaboración y propuesta del modelo matemático que se basa en función de las densidades de la pulpa tomadas estas en cada flujo del clasificador y de las densidades obtenidas al hacer el mallaje en húmedo respectivamenter en las mallas ya mencionadas y el tercero es la implementación de el software Goliat 0. 2 en el lenguaje de programación LabVIEW con los modelos matemáticos que se propone donde se puede visualizar en el ordenador los resultados obtenidos al instante. Las pruebas de aplicación y comprobación se realizarón, en las plantas concentradoras de “Austria Duvaz” en Morococha, “Corona” de Chumpe en Yauricocha, Yauyos y “Huari” ubicada en La Oroya perteneciente a la UNCP. Cuyos resultados fueron muy halagadores, coincidiendo casi en forma total con la hipótesis planteada. Como demostración de que la metodología funciona óptimamente, tanto en el control de procesos como en la simulación, se puede verificar con los siguientes resultados obtenidos, el tamaño de corte (d 50) calculado[51]; con los datos tomados del libro del Ms. Cs. Juan Rivera Zevallos[58] en las páginas 307 - 324, es de 77. 31 micrones y la eficiencia de clasificación es de 42. 32 % y haciendo los cálculos con la métodologia propuesta el d 50 es de 77. 32 micrones y la eficiencia de clasificación da un valor de 42. 71 %, se puede notar claramente que casi no hay diferencia, en el segundo caso en la comparación de los resultados de los datos obtenidos en la planta concentradora de “Chumpe” Yauricocha, al hacer el control de procesos y los cálculos respectivos por la metodología tradicional, como se realiza en la mayoría de las plantas, da un valor del d 50 de 81. 31 micrones y la eficiencia de clasificación da un valor de 57. 93 % y al hacer el control y sus respectivos cálculos con la métodología“Cebaco” da como resultado el d 50 de 83. 56 micrones y la eficiencia de clasificación de 53. 18 % se puede también notar sobre todo en esta última que la diferencia no es significativa, siendo el nivel de significancia de 0, 08 y con una confidencia de 92 %, en el tercer caso también al evaluar otra prueba de los datos tomados de la planta concentradora mencionada al hacer los cálculos con el método tradicional da una eficiencia de clasificación de 48. 49 % y con la métodología“Cebaco” la eficiencia de clasificación resulta de 48. 02 % que en la práctica casi son similares, en el cuarto caso al hacer la evaluación de los resultados obtenidos en la planta concentradora “Austria Duvaz” ubicada en Morococha, el d 50 calculado por la metodología tradicional da un valor de 88. 3061 y el d 50 calculado con la metodología “Cebaco” da un valor de 85. 2559 existiendo una diferencia de tan solamente 3. 45 % y el valor de la eficiencia de clasificación por la metodología tradicional da un valor de 51. 8102 y el calculado con la metodología “Cebaco” da un valor de 51. 6255 existiendo una diferencia de 0. 36 % y la razón de carga circulante calculada por la metodología tradicional da un valor de 1. 903 y la calculada con la metodología “Cebaco” da un valor de 1. 887 cuya diferencia es de tan solamente 0. 84 %. Y la demostración más importante, donde se comprueba que el método“Cebaco” es una propuesta adecuada, se da con el incremento de las ganancias para la planta concentradora y ésto se obtuvo de las valorizaciones de los concentrados en ambos casos, uno con el balance metalúrgico obtenido con el método tradicional y el otro con el balance metalúrgico obtenido de los trabajos realizados con el método propuesto y ésto se fundamenta en el tiempo de control, ya que el tiempo con el método tradicional en el mejor de los casos es de 4 horas y con el método propuesto es de tan solamente 5 minutos esto implica que las correcciones se hacen casi al instante por lo tanto trae como consecuencia la mejora de las leyes y de las recuperaciones de los concentrados y por ende de la productividad, por los cálculos hecho se determino una ganancia de 11. 53 dólares americanos más por tonelada de mineral tratado al realizar el control con el método propuesto...|$|E

The Hevi chromite sand produced by a single stage washing of chromite sand was found to exhibit lower breaking strength in service. Forty five samples of no-bake chromite sand mixes were prepared with furan resin at room temperature and 39 % humidity from chromite sand washed in single and two stages and cured at 2, 4 and 24 hours. Eighteen of the samples washed in single and two stages were tested for breaking strength without heat treatment, while the 27 obtained from single stage washing sand mix were heated to 900 oC and held at 12, 14 and 16 minutes before cooling. <b>Re-washing</b> gave an appreciable increase in breaking strength only for samples cured for 24 hours. The results obtained showed that highest breaking strength occurred in heat treated and cured samples with the highest occurring at curing period of 24 hours and 900 oC with holding time of 16 minutes. For <b>re-washed</b> samples held in room atmosphere, there was a decrease in breaking strength compared to the single stage washed samples. The implication of this work is that Hevi chromite sand has better breaking strength when heat treated at 900 °C and held in the temperature for 16 minutes.

40|$|Issue: A {{successful}} {{program for}} <b>re-washing</b> recycled glass containers {{for use in}} applications such as wine bottling depends on overcoming a number of challenges, including developing collection infrastructure, sorting diverse bottle streams, achieving efficient washing, and market penetration. Bottle washing programs may focus {{on a variety of}} bottle types, including beer bottles, wine bottles, or juice bottles. This Best Practice focuses on the key elements of a wine bottle-washing program, although many of the concepts are applicable to other containers. A successful bottle-washing program requires the integration of collection and supply infrastructure, sorting protocols, and equipment selection. Best Practice: Historically, bottles were manufactured to heavy specifications as returnables. Today, most glass containers are manufactured as one-way containers, not intended to withstand the rigors of multiple re-washings. Wine bottles remain an exception. Wine bottles manufactured in the United States generally have the same weight as those manufactured in Europe, where washing wine bottles is a common procedure. Because it contains a non-pressurized liquid, a wine bottle does not have the same potential to break from pressure, as does a defective container of beer or soda. However, the development of coated glass bottles may lead to lighter weight wine bottles as well. In addition, only regions with an adequate wine production industry are potential locations for wine bottle washing facilities. Finally, wine bottles wholesale for 35 ¢- 40 ¢each, while beer bottles cost only about 10 ¢, so washing may be more economically feasible for wine bottles. The collection of bottles must be structured to maximize the recovery of usable containers. Certai...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Different {{methods of}} obtaining the product given were tested and {{rational}} modes {{for the proposed}} technology were chosen {{in the development of}} technology for production of sugar beet concentrated juice. The sugar beet concentrated juice is obtained as follows: sugar beets are washed in the continuous action washing machine, checked, rotten or spoiled beets are removed from the cycle, and insufficiently treated roots are directed to <b>re-washing.</b> Then with the help of thermal processing the sugar beet is peeled. The peeled roots are white. They are crushed to the 3 - 4 mm particles size, mixed with acidified to pH 3, 5 - 4, 0 water (hydromodule 1 - 1. 2), then the resulting mass is heated to 80 0 C temperature. The use of acidified water is necessary to prevent the darkening initiation. Then the received sugar beet mass is fed to pressing to obtain its juice. The pressed juice depending on the beet source contains 12 % of DS and 1. 5 - 3 % reducing substances (RS) of the total mass of dry substances. The juice concentration is under the suction of 0. 008 MPa at the boiling temperature of up to 60 0 C to the content of 70 % DS. Due to the delicate mode, the sugars breakdown is less intensive, the finished product is of good quality. At the simultaneous concentration with steam the volatile substances with a specific smell are removed, that improves the juice taste and smell. Under this mode, the sugar hydrolysis is intensive, there is a growth reducing substances up to 20 %, the color is increased to 40 % density. The research results allow to recommend the product obtained as the sugar syrup substitute...|$|R
40|$|High labour costs, {{due to the}} {{existing}} technology that still involves {{a high degree of}} manually based processing, incur overall high production costs in the fish processing industry. Therefore, a higher degree of automation of processing lines is often desirable, and this strategy has been adopted by the Norwegian fish processing industry to cut-down production costs. In fish processing, despite a slower uptake than in other domains of industry, the use of computer vision as a strategy for automation is beginning to gain the necessary maturity for online grading and evaluation of various attributes related to fish quality. This can enable lower production costs and simultaneously increase quality through more consistent and non-destructive evaluation of the fish products. This thesis investigates the possibility for automation of fish processing operations by the application of computer vision. The thesis summarises research conducted towards the development of computer vision-based methods for evaluation of various attributes related to whole fish and flesh quality. A brief summary of the main findings is presented here. By application of computer vision, a method for the inspection of the presence of residual blood in the body cavity of whole Atlantic salmon was developed to determine the adequacy of washing. Inadequate washing of fish after bleeding is quite common in commercial processing plants. By segmenting the body cavity and performing a colour analysis, it was shown that the degree of bleeding correlated well with colour parameters, resulting in correct classification of the fish with residual blood. The developed computer vision-based classifier showed a good agreement with the manual classification of the fish that needed <b>re-washing.</b> The proposed method has potential to automate this type of inspection in fish processing lines. In addition, a computer vision-based classifier for quality grading of whole Atlantic salmon in different grading classes, as specified by the industrial standard, was developed. In the proposed solution, after segmentation of the salmon from the image scene, {{with the use of the}} computer vision techniques, it was possible to extract non-redundant geometrical features describing the size and shape of fish. Based on these features, a classifier was developed for classification of fish into respective grading classes. The average correct rate of classification was in good agreement with the manual labelling, and the method has a potential for grading of Atlantic salmon in fish processing lines. Regarding fillet grading, a computer vision-based sorting method for Atlantic salmon fillets according to their colour score was developed. The method and classifier/matching algorithm was based on the present industrial standard NS 9402 for evaluation of fillets by colour according to Roche Cards. As a result, fillets or parts of fillets, could be classified into different colour grades. This is important for the industry since different markets tend to have different preferences for fillet colour. This classification method is suitable for online industrial purposes. In addition, the method gives colour evaluation of fresh and smoked fillets in the CIELab space, similar to the L, a, and b values generated by a Minolta Chromameter, for different parts of fillets as well as for the entire fillet. The advantage of the computer vision-based method derives from the flexibility in the choice of the size of the region of interest of the fillet for colour measurement, as opposed to the Chromameter, where the Minolta generated values are obtained by interrogating a very small area of the fillet (8 mm). The method can also be used for detection of colour non-uniformities (discoloration) in both fresh and smoked fillets. A method for computer vision-based measurements and monitoring of transient 2 D and 3 D changes in the size and shape of fillets during the rigor process and ice storage was developed. The method successfully measured the size (length, width, area) and shape (roundness) of Atlantic salmon and cod fillets, and monitored changes to these during ice storage with high precision. This was demonstrated by comparison of the exhausted and anesthetized fillets. By laser scanning of the fillet, it was possible to obtain size changes in the height (mm) and area of the fillet in cross-section. The method can be used not only for size and shape analysis of fillets but also for other fish products, both in on-line, as well as off-line conditions as a tool for monitoring 2 D/ 3 D size and shape changes. The method can also be used for determination of fillet yield measured in thickness, which is an important parameter for the industry. Together with the colour grading ability, this method can also be used for full feature evaluation and classification of any fish or food product from a single image (colour, size and shape in 2 D/ 3 D). If filleting of fish is done pre-rigor, care should be exercised during colour grading since transient colour changes occur in the post-mortem period. As these changes are more pronounced than those that occur during ice storage, incorrect colour grading can occur. The computer vision method developed for evaluation of colour changes in fillets during rigor, ice storage, and due to effects of perimortem handling stress was considered as the most suitable method for industrial purposes when compared to both the Minolta Chromamater and sensory analysis by a panel. A computer vision-based method for evaluation of fresh and smoked fillets with respect to bleeding was developed. This form of evaluation is important for the industry as residual blood in fillets may lead to reduced visual acceptance of the product. The method was considered suitable for the purpose of this type of evaluation. The developed computer vision methods have potential for automation of the mentioned grading operations in the commercial fish processing lines. Application of the proposed solutions would lower the production costs, while simultaneously increasing the quality of the products through a more consistent and non-destructive evaluation of these products.
