The paper gives an overview of the current state of modeling and control of aerodynamic flow instabilities in axial and <b>radial</b> <b>compressors.</b> It discusses the differences between rotating stall and these compressors but focuses on active control systems applied in experimental studies. The evolution of models and control systems demonstrates that this research area is still developing, but models cannot yet describe all forms of instabilities encountered. Moreover, apart from a few exceptions, only proportional feedback controllers are currently used. As a result, future research has to concentrate on gaining additional insight into the mechanisms behind the flow instabilities and on how to incorporate this knowledge in a model.

40|$|Compressors {{are widely}} used for the {{pressurization}} of fluids. Applications involve air compression for use in aircraft engines and pressurization and transportation of gas {{in the process and}} chemical industries. The article focuses on two commonly used types of continuous flow compressors: the axial compressor, where the gaseous fluid is processed in a direction parallel to the rotational axis, and the <b>radial</b> or centrifugal <b>compressor,</b> where the pressurized fluid leaves the compressor in a direction perpendicular to the rotational axis. In these machines, the entering fluid is pressurized by first accelerating it via the kinetic energy imparted in the rotors and then converting the kinetic energy into potential energy by decelerating the fluid in diverging channels.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the possibility of implementing axial compressors in the proposed single shaft Pebble Bed Micro Model (PBMM) cycle. Software for the development of preliminary axial compressor design was written with the aid of Engineering Equation Solver (EES), The preliminary design parameters obtained from the EES program was then used as input for the compressor analysis in Concepts NREC. An extensive literature review was conducted to obtain the required technical information concerning cycle analysis and compressor design. Cycle simulations were carried out with both Helium and Nitrogen as the working fluid to rationalise the most suitable cycle for this application. EES and Concepts NREC (Axial) were used to validate the software programs written for the cycle analysis and the preliminary compressor design. The EES output parameters of both programs closely resemble that of the verification software. Axial and <b>radial</b> <b>compressors</b> were considered during the selection of the most appropriate compressor to be utilized in the cycle. As a result of this study it could be concluded that <b>radial</b> <b>compressors</b> with Nitrogen as the working fluid will be the best option in terms of complexity and expenses. A detailed cost analysis is recommended as it was not part of this study's scope. A detailed cost investigation could advance the conclusion of this study.

In the past, most of the rotordynamic damping measurements have been carried out by universities on test rigs specially designed to measure labyrinth forces, which are mainly responsible for the change in damping at high pressures. Unfortunately, all these tests have been carried out at pressure levels far below the levels of industrial applications. Thus, the presented tests on complete compressors, ready for offshore applications, are certainly unique. The tests showed a generally conservative prediction of the damping.

The limit imposed on the operating range of a <b>radial</b> flow <b>compressor</b> by surging or pulsations in the reduced flow region has long been a source of concern to design engineers who would like to use this otherwise simple, lightweight and efficient compressor. A preliminary study {{of the nature of the}} pulsations lead to the design of the Deflected Spill Pickup in an effort to simulate the compressor flow characteristics under conditions of close control and simple analytical boundaries. A fair degree of agreement was obtained between the flow and instability characteristics of the spill and the actual compressor to which it was proportioned. The analysis provides an explanation for the observed differences in flow characteristics and suggests the possibilities of producing closer agreement. During the course of the investigation it became evident that the Deflected Spill Pickup could become a valuable component in the experimental study of other flow instability phenomena by providing a source of intermediate velocity air with the flat pressure vs flow characteristics of a system closely coupled to a <b>radial</b> flow <b>compressor.</b> The work with the spill also provided the groundwork for a suggested design for a <b>radial</b> flow <b>compressor</b> that should be free of the investigated instability in the reduced flow region of operations.

Typically, for the determination of the azimuthal mode orders Discrete Fourier Transformation or Least Squares Fit are used. For these methods, the amount of microphones needed for an exact reconstruction is based on the Nyquist criterion.
