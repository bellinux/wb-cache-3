I have sat at {{one side of a}} room and {{observed}} her at the other, perhaps in an excited, genial moment, when she had some of her favourites round her--her old beaux, for instance, yourself and Helstone, with whom she is so playful, pleasant, and eloquent. I have watched her when she was most natural, most lively, and most lovely; my judgment has pronounced her beautiful. Beautiful she is at times, when her mood and her array partake of the splendid. I have drawn a little nearer, feeling that our terms of acquaintance gave me the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach.</b> I have joined the circle round her seat, caught her eye, and mastered her attention; then we have conversed; and others, thinking me, perhaps, peculiarly privileged, have withdrawn by degrees, and left us alone. Were we happy thus left? For myself, I must say No. Always a feeling of constraint came over me; always I was disposed to be stern and strange. We talked politics and business. No soft sense of domestic intimacy ever opened our hearts, or thawed our language and made it flow easy and limpid. If we had confidences, they were confidences of the counting-house, not of the heart. Nothing in her cherished affection in me, made me better, gentler; she only stirred my brain and whetted my acuteness. She never crept into my heart or influenced its pulse; and for this good reason, no doubt, because I had not the secret of making her love me." ...|$|E

An initial descriptive analysis shows that four major categories of social spending (cash spending on older people and those of working age; service spending on health and for other purposes) are almost entirely unrelated to one another and that different welfare state regimes or families of nations exhibit quite different patterns of spending. The article proceeds to demonstrate that both the determinants and the outcomes of these different categories of spending also differ quite radically. In policy terms, most importantly, the article shows that cross-national differences in poverty and inequality among advanced nations are to a very large degree a function of the extent of cash spending on programmes catering to the welfare needs of those of working age.

To {{increase the likelihood of}} having at least one successful product, multiple approaches may be simultaneously funded at the various NPD stages. The managerial challenge is to construct ex ante an appropriate NPD pipeline by choosing the <b>right</b> number <b>of</b> <b>approaches</b> to be funded at each stage. This so-called pipeline problem is also present in, among others, advertising copy selection and new products test markets problems. We describe here a normative model for structuring pipelines for such situations. The optimal structure of the pipeline is driven by the cost <b>of</b> the development <b>approach,</b> its probability <b>of</b> survival, and the expected profitability. We illustrate the workability and implications of the model by applying it to some real-world scenarios in the pharmaceutical industry, and by comparing its normative pipeline recommendations against actual pipelines. Our results suggest that, for the cases we studied, firms tend to use narrower pipelines for their new drug development than they should, and thereby they underspend on research and development. We also present general qualitative insights for one- and two-stage NPD optimal pipeline structures. Marketing, New products, Innovations pipelines, R& D projects, Pharmaceutical industry...|$|R
40|$|In Canada the entrenchment of the Charter <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> and Freedoms {{generated}} {{a good deal}} of debate about the possibility of using law in the struggle for social transformation. Although couched in general terms, the current debate is ultimately about the possibility of asserting liberal democratic legal rights in courts in order to transform existing relations of subordination and domination. Somewhat remarkably, the positive claim that litigating entrenched legal rights encourages social transformation tends to be made almost exclusively at the theoretical level. Theoretical possibilities, rather than concrete victories, are invoked to support the claim for the transformative capacity <b>of</b> liberal legal <b>rights.</b> Instead <b>of</b> <b>approaching</b> the question <b>of</b> litigating social change from an exclusively theoretical perspective, this paper examines contemporary examples in order to illustrate some of the possibilities of and limits to this strategy.

A reason for the recent attention A.I. integration is attracting is that there have already been created a number of (relatively) simple A.I. systems for specific problem domains (such as computer vision, speech synthesis, etc.), and that integrating what's already available is a more logical approach to broader A.I. than building monolithic systems from scratch.|$|R

A difficult aspect of these type of attacks is that they cannot simply be prevented by implementing a technical solution. This is because they target humans instead of computer systems. One of the most important aspects of social engineering is to have a solid base of information. This information is not only needed to find the right person to social engineer but also to find the <b>right</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>approach,</b> as well as to aid in the overall successfulness of the attack.

Enforcement of existing copyright laws is difficult due to the widespread nature <b>of</b> unauthorised sharing. <b>Rights</b> holders have pursued individuals and organisations involved through existing legal channels, with limited success. They have also engaged in voluntary arrangements with Internet Service Providers to educate and, potentially punish infringers.

The approaches to addressing the issue have been controversial, mainly because of lack of transparency in their development and concerns about their potential impact on the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> individuals.

40|$|The {{ideal of}} the rule of law speaks {{differently}} to law-makers and law-appliers. The judge, being the legal official tasked with the application of law by the court, is not in the lawmaker’s position of choosing what, legally, ought to obtain, but rather is tasked with furthering, by administering, what, legally, already obtains. This demarcation of responsibilities rests on the ability of the law-maker to settle authoritatively moral-political questions in such a way as to render possible the artificial techne of legal reasoning. Bills <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> are unusual law-making acts insofar as they deliberately fail to settle moral-political questions under law by declining to specify the general right ‘P has the right to x’. How, then, have judges sought to satisfy their law-applying role in relation to disputed claims <b>of</b> <b>rights?</b> The <b>approach</b> shared by judges in Europe and much of the Commonwealth is to interpret the open-ended <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> bills <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> to include nearly all possible instances of conduct that could be related to the right, with the consequence that nearly all legislation, including legislative specifications <b>of</b> open-ended <b>rights,</b> could be held to infringe the bill <b>of</b> <b>rights.</b> In turn, the legality of legislation turns on judiciallycreated standards of proportionality and balancing, which lack the discipline afforded by technical legal reasoning. As a consequence, judges have assumed the function of law-makers, with all of the associated challenges to the rule of law when law-applying institutions make law in the very moment the legal subject is before them...|$|R
