40|$|During liver {{fibrosis}} hepatic stellate cells become activated, transforming into proliferative myofibroblastic cells expressing type I collagen and ?-smooth muscle actin. They become the major {{producers of the}} fibrotic neomatrix in injured liver. This study examines if activated stellate cells are a committed phenotype, or whether they can become deactivated by extracellular matrix. Stellate cells isolated from normal rat liver proliferated and expressed mRNA for activation markers, ?-smooth muscle actin, type I procollagen and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases- 1 following 5 – 7 day culture on plastic, but culture on Matrigel suppressed proliferation and mRNA expression. Activated stellate cells were recovered from plastic by trypsinisation and <b>replated</b> onto plastic, type I collagen films or Matrigel. Cells <b>replated</b> on plastic and type I collagen films proliferated and remained morphologically myofibroblastic, expressing ?-smooth muscle actin and type I procollagen. However, activated cells <b>replated</b> on Matrigel showed < 30 % of the proliferative rate of these cells, and this was associated with reduced cellular expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in response to serum. Activated HSC <b>replated</b> on Matrigel for 3 – 7 days progressively reduced their expression of mRNA for type I procollagen and ?-smooth muscle actin and both became undetectable after 7 days. We conclude that basement membrane-like matrix induces deactivation of stellate cells.

Even though MESC 2. 10 cells exhibit features of dopaminergic neurons in vitro, none of the cells expressed tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) after transplantation into a rat model of Parkinson's disease. We examined whether this is caused by cell death or loss of transmitter phenotype. Cells were cultured in differentiation medium, then harvested and <b>replated</b> into the same medium where they continued to express TH, whereas <b>replated</b> cells fed medium lacking differentiation factors (dibutyryl cAMP and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor) did not. Interestingly, cultures grown in the absence of differentiation factors could regain TH expression once exposed to differentiation medium. Our data suggest that TH expression in vitro is inducible in neurons derived from the NIESC 2. 10 cell line and that the dopaminergic phenotype of these cells in vivo might be unstable.

40|$|AbstractAccumulating {{evidence}} suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation {{plays an important role}} in the development of the central nervous system and in the differentiation of neuronal cells. To identify protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that might regulate signaling events leading to neuronal cell differentiation, we cloned PTP genes from the murine P 19 embryonic carcinoma cell line and examined the change of their expression during differentiation. P 19 cells are known to be pluripotent and the aggregate formation and subsequent <b>replating</b> in the presence of retinoic acid (RA) induce growth arrest and neuronal differentiation. The results demonstrated that among several PTP genes expressed in P 19 cells, a cytosolic Src homology region 2 domain-containing PTP, SHP- 1, is expressed highly in undifferentiated P 19 cells, but is reduced to an undetectable level at day 3 after <b>replating</b> in the presence of RA. Further, SHP- 1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated at day 1 after <b>replating.</b> When ectopic SHP- 1 was constitutively expressed, P 19 cells continued to proliferate and failed to differentiate upon stimulation with RA.

40|$|As {{initiators}} of {{the adaptive}} immune response, dendritic cells (DCs) {{can be used}} for anti-cancer immunotherapy. On addition of proper maturation stimuli DCs mature and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that skew T cells in the direction needed for anti-cancer therapy. Further optimization of DC maturation might improve the efficacy of DCs for clinical application. We describe that <b>replating</b> and a subsequent resting period enhance the inflammatory properties of the DCs. Cultured immature monocyte-derived DCs were harvested and, after <b>replating,</b> were stimulated immediately or after 2 [*]h of rest. Cytokine production was assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Dynamics of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa b (NFκB) activation in DCs was analyzed using flow cytometry and imaging flow cytometry. Resting immature DCs after <b>replating,</b> before addition of Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, increased the production of pro-inflammatory but not anti-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, the speed of MAPK phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFκB was increased when DCs were allowed to rest before TLR stimulation. The effect was imprinted, transient and did not reflect a temporary loss of responsiveness, indicating that signaling induced by culture adaptation of DCs synergizes with TLR signals to increase cytokine production. DCs rested before TLR stimulation induced more interferon (IFN) -γ production in CD 4 -positive and CD 8 -positive T cells. Introduction of a resting step in the DC maturation method, which is cheap and easy to implement, will improve the generation of pro-inflammatory DCs for cancer immunotherapy.

Introduction of the Mll-AF 9 fusion gene into {{embryonic stem cells}} results in leukemia in mice with cell-type specificity similar to humans. In this study we used myeloid colony assays, immunophenotyping, and transplantation to evaluate myelopoiesis in Mll-AF 9 mice. Colony assays demonstrated that both prenatal and postnatal Mll-AF 9 tissues have significantly increased numbers of CD 11 b(+) /CD 117 (+) /Gr- 1 (+/-) myeloid cells, often in compact clusters. The self-renewal capacity of prenatal myeloid progenitors was found to decrease following serial <b>replating</b> of colony-forming cells. In contrast, early postnatal myeloid progenitors increased following replating; however, the enhanced self-renewal of early postnatal myeloid progenitor cells was limited and {{did not result in}} long-term cell lines or leukemia in vivo. Unlimited <b>replating,</b> long-term CD 11 b/Gr- 1 (+) myeloid cell lines, and the ability to produce early leukemia in vivo in transplantation experiments, were found only in mice with overt leukemia. Prenatal Mll-AF 9 tissues had reduced total (mature and progenitor) CD 11 b/Gr- 1 (+) cells compared with wild-type tissues. Colony <b>replating,</b> immunophenotyping, and cytochemistry suggest that any perturbation of cellular differentiation from the prenatal stage onward is partial and largely reversible.

Clinical data suggest that Ras mutation is a frequent cooperating event in t(8; 21) AML. Whether constitutively active Ras promotes leukemogenesis on the t(8; 21) background has not been demonstrated experimentally. Here, we retrovirally expressed N-RasG 12 D in AE-expressing human hematopoieticcells to investigate cooperativity. The AE/N-RasG 12 D cultures were cytokine-independent, enriched for CD 34 positivity, and possessed increased colony-forming and <b>replating</b> abilities. N-RasG 12 D expression led to Bcl- 2 up-regulation and reduced apoptosis.

40|$|Objective: Preparation of viable cultured adult cardiomyocytes (vARCs) is a {{prerequisite}} for cell-based transplantation and tissue engineering. Ectopic gene expression is important in this context. Here, we present an in vitro cell <b>replating</b> strategy using Accutase™ for cultured vARCs, allowing ectopic gene expression. Methods: Cultured vARCs from 6 - to 8 -week-old rats were used. Transfections with EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) constructs, Mlc- 3 f-EGFP or α-actinin-EGFP were performed using adenovirus-enhanced transferrin-mediated infection (AVET). Accutase™ (PAA Laboratories, Linz, Austria) was used for the detachment of cultured cells. Immunohistochemical analysis, together with confocal laser microscopy was used for structural analysis of the cells. Results: Cultured vARCs could be detached with a high yield (40 to 60 %) from primary cultures using Accutase™. The cultivation period {{plays an important role in}} the yield of viable cells. Resultant replated vARCs (rep-vARCs) rapidly (1 - 2 h) acquired a rounded up shape without degradation of their contractile apparatus, which is in contrast to the rod-shaped freshly isolated vARCs (fi-vARCs). The detached cells survived passage through a narrow syringe needle. After seeding, detached cells rapidly attached to various substrates, increased their content of the contractile apparatus, and formed cell-cell contacts within 3 days after reseeding. The detached cells survived passage through a narrow syringe needle. The high recovery of cells after <b>replating</b> enabled the use of the AVET system for gene delivery. AVET is free of infectious particles and does not lead to expression of viral proteins. Transfection of vARCs prior to detachment had a small effect on cell recovery and ectopically synthesized proteins were properly localized after <b>replating.</b> Conclusions: Detachment of cultured vARCs using Accutase™ is well compatible with ectopic gene expression and yields a viable transgenic population of vARCs that eventually may be suitable as transgenic cardiomyocyte graft...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of expression of proteins of the INK 4 family, particularly p 16, on the growth and self-renewal kinetics of hematopoietic cells.

Second, to sequester p 16 (INK 4 a) and related INK 4 proteins, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK 4) was retrovirally transduced into normal human CD 34 (+) bone marrow cells and then cultured in myeloid colony-forming cell (CFC) assays. The growth of CDK 4 -transduced colonies was more rapid; the cell-doubling time was reduced; and, upon <b>replating,</b> the colonies produced greater yields of secondary colonies than mock-untransduced controls. Third, colony formation was compared by marrow cells from p 16 (INK 4 a-/-) mice and wild-type mice. The results from p 16 (INK 4 a-/-) marrow were similar to those from CDK 4 -transduced human CFCs, in terms of growth rate and <b>replating</b> ability, and were partially reversed by RMGT of p 16 (INK 4 a). Lines of immature granulocytic cells were raised from 15 individual colonies grown from the marrow of p 16 (INK 4 a-/-) mice.
