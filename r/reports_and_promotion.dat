In terms of promotion and tenure, faculty members must declare an area of excellence {{in one of these}} three domains. The FLC on Public Scholarship is a 3 -year initiative co-sponsored by Academic Affairs and the Center for Service and Learning (CSL). Seven faculty members from across campus were selected {{to be part of the}} 2015 - 2016 FLC, and two co-chairs worked closely with CSL staff to plan and facilitate the ongoing work. The FLC is charged with defining public scholarship, identifying criteria to evaluate this type of scholarship, assist faculty in documenting their community-engaged work, and working with department Chairs and Deans in adapting criteria into promotion and tenure materials. The intended audiences for this work includes faculty, community-engaged scholars, public scholars, promotion and tenure committees, external reviewers, and department Chairs and Deans.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the relations between}} the European Union standardized health indicators and the community-based health policy. One of the goals of the European Commission is to provide standardized information on health {{in order to make it}} comparable at a trans-national level. Hence, numerous projects aimed at developing health indicators, and improving databases relating to these were supported by the Program of Community Action in the Field of Public Health. In this paper the authors argue that standardized health indicators can provide more than a prototype for a future health monitoring system. Bearing in mind that the production of comparable information on health is based upon four different tasks (the analysis of data needs in a specific area, definition of indicators <b>and</b> quality assurance, <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> analysis, <b>and</b> <b>promotion</b> of the results) the authors assert that all of these tasks are important steps towards the development of community-based health policy.

40|$|Health inequities, or avoidable inequalities {{in health}} between groups of people, are {{increasingly}} recognized and tackled to improve public health. Canada’s interest in health inequities goes back over 40 years, with the landmark 1974 Lalonde <b>report,</b> <b>and</b> continues with the 2011 Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health, which affirmed a global political commitment to implementing a social determinants of health approach to reducing health inequities.

Many programs, policies and projects with potential impacts on health equity and determinants of health have been implemented across Canada.

40|$|If recent pronouncements {{and events}} are any barometer, many organisations in New Zealand look {{set to begin}} issuing Triple-Bottom-Line reports. Such reports are {{intended}} to communicate an organisation’s social and environmental performance {{as well as its}} financial performance.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis investigates {{the effect of}} marital and family status on the performance and job productivity of male U. S. Marine Corps officers. The analysis includes evaluation of fitness <b>reports,</b> retention, <b>and</b> <b>promotion</b> to O- 4 and O- 5 ranks as performance measures. The primary goal {{is to examine the}} existence of any marriage premium on officers' performance and productivity and to investigate potential causal hypotheses. The personnel database used for the analysis includes more than 27, 000 male Marine officers who entered the Marine Corps between FY 1980 and 1999. After controlling for selection, estimating fixed effects and using panel data in order to capture timely-varying effects, this study finds that there is a marriage premium for all performance measures. The thesis rejects the explanation that such premiums are due to supervisor favoritism. Moreover, married male officers obtain higher fitness report scores, higher <b>promotion</b> probabilities, <b>and</b> higher retention probabilities than single officers. Each additional year spent in marriage increases fitness <b>report</b> scores <b>and</b> retention probabilities. Having additional non-spousal dependents increase fitness <b>report</b> scores <b>and</b> retention probabilities. On the other hand, being a currently single but "to-be-married" officer yields higher premium, as married officers, for all productivity and performance indicators. This supports selectivity into marriage as a partial explanation of the source of the marriage premium. Lieutenant Junior Grade, Turkish NavyFirst Lieutenant, Turkish Arm...|$|R

40|$|In Part 1 {{we looked}} at what {{evaluation}} is – its purpose and {{the context in which}} it occurs. We moved on in Part 2 to the evaluation process itself, especially as it applies to information projects, products and services. The discussion looked at the four major steps in the evaluation process: preparing the evaluation terms of reference; designing the evaluation; implementing it; and following it up. In Part 3 we look at the evaluation tools. The tools featured here are those that we consider to be well suited to evaluating information projects, products and services. With the increasing demand for information practitioners to evaluate their projects themselves, and not rely on external evaluations, the tools chosen are also seen as suitable for self-evaluation and for fostering learning and stakeholder participation. The term ‘tools’ applies to the range of tried-and-tested approaches you can use to evaluate your product/service. Most of them can be used at all stages of the evaluation process. We have divided them here into: •	project planning tools (planning frameworks, benchmarking and indicators) : as their name implies, these are used to plan a project and, if done properly, can be invaluable reference points and sources of information when the project is subsequently evaluated •	evaluation planning tools (terms of reference and logic model) : using these tools, and drawing on the project planning frameworks, will establish a strong base from which to select the most appropriate evaluation implementation tools and to conduct the evaluation •	evaluation implementation tools (data collection, SWOT analysis, questionnaires, focus groups, flowcharts, case studies, interviews, creative tools, reviews and data analysis) : usually a mix of tools will be used to evaluate a product/service, but the particular mix depends on a range of factors, including evaluation purpose, time, finance and available skills •	applying evaluation findings (report writing, dissemination channels, promotional approaches, using force-field analysis and brainstorming to create action plans) : we put particular emphasis on these tools because, all too often, a great deal of work is done on planning and implementing an evaluation and producing findings and recommendations, but poor <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>promotion</b> results in little, if any, effort to translate the findings into action All the tools described here feature in Part 4, where we provide evaluation guidelines for selected information products/services.
