2500|$|Although the Christmas {{season by}} {{definition}} runs until January 6 (Epiphany), and is observed {{until at least}} New Year's Eve by the public, almost all broadcasters skip the last Twelve Days of Christmas, abruptly ending all holiday music at or even before midnight on December 25, and not playing a single Christmas song again until the next November. (Several radio stations actually promote this, with ads that proudly proclaim to listeners weary of the Christmas music that the station's <b>regular</b> <b>format</b> will indeed return on December 26, as soon as Christmas Day is over.) It {{is not uncommon for}} broadcasters to market the twelve-day period preceding Christmas (December 14 to 25) as the [...] "Twelve Days of Christmas", contrary to the traditional definition. One {{reason for this is that}} much popular Christmas music is so closely associated with Christmas Day itself that it would be difficult or impossible to play after December 25 without bringing up references that the broadcaster may wish to ignore (such as those that involve Santa Claus, who has already come and gone by Christmas morning). On occasion, some Christmas music stations will continue to play at least some Christmas music through the weekend following Christmas, or even through New Year's Day (particularly when stunting in anticipation of a format change; see below), but never any later.|$|E
