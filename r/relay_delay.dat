40|$|Abstract—Microelectromechanical relays have {{recently}} been proposed for ultra-low-power digital logic because their nearly ideal switching behavior can potentially enable reductions in supply voltage (Vdd) and, hence, energy per operation {{beyond the limits of}} MOSFETs. Using a calibrated analytical model, a sensitivity-based energy–delay optimization approach is developed in order to establish simple relay design guidelines. It is found that, at the optimal design point, every 2 × energy increase can be traded off for a ∼ 1. 5 × reduction in <b>relay</b> <b>delay.</b> A contact-gap-to-actuation-gap thickness ratio of 0. 7 – 0. 8 is shown to result in the most energy-efficient relay operation, implying that pull-in opera-tion is preferred for an energy-efficient relay design. Based on the analytical model and design guidelines, a scaling theory for relays is presented. A scaled relay technology is projected to provide> 10 × energy savings over an equivalent MOSFET technology, for circuits operating at clock frequencies up to ∼ 100 MHz.

The first is the relay-with-unlimited lookahead, where each relay transmission can depend on its entire received sequence, and the second is the relay-without-delay, where the relay transmission can depend only on current and past received symbols, i. e., d = 0. Upper and lower bounds on capacity for these two channels that are tight in some cases are presented. It is shown that the cut-set bound for the classical relay channel, corresponding to the case where d = 1, does not hold for the relaywithout-delay. Further, it is shown that instantaneous relaying can be optimal and can achieve higher rates than the classical cut-set bound. Capacity for the classes of degraded and semi-deterministic relay-with-unlimited-look-ahead and relay-without-delay are established. These results are then extended to the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) relay-with-delay case, where it is shown that for any d 0, capacity is achieved using amplify-and-forward when the channel from the sender to the relay is sufficiently weaker than the other two channels. In addition, it is shown that a superposition of amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward can achieve higher rates than the classical cut-set bound. The relay-with-delay model is then extended to feedforward relay networks. It is shown that capacity is determined only by the relative delays of paths from the sender to the receiver and not by their absolute delays.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{feedback}} delay {{on the performance of}} amplify-and-forward (AF) relay selection over a Nakagami-m fading environment. Spatial diversity can be improved by employing multiple relays with selection; however, this diversity gain cannot be fully realized when the feedback delay is present in the decision metric. Hence, in this paper, we quantify this detrimental effect by deriving the exact closed-form solution to outage probability, average symbol error rate (SER), and generalized higher moments of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for both channel state information (CSI) -assisted and fixed-gain relay. Further, an exact closed form of the ergodic capacity for CSI-assisted relay is derived, and a tight approximation is provided for the fixed-gain relay case. To have a clear picture of the diversity gain variation, we analyze the system in high SNR and obtain simple asymptotic results. Monte Carlo simulation is used to verify the analytical work.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the effects of}} data {{relaying}} in wireless sensor networks (WS-Nets) under QoS constraints with two different strategies. In the first, data packets originating from the same source are sent to the base station possibly along several different paths, while in the second, exactly one path is used for this purpose. The two strategies correspond to splitting and not splitting relaying traffic respectively. We model a sensor network architecture based on a three-tier hierarchy of nodes which generalizes to a two-tier WSNet with multiple sinks. Our results apply therefore to both types of networks. Based on the assumptions in our model, we describe several methods for computing relaying paths that are optimal with respect to energy consumption and satisfy QoS requirements expressed by the delay with which data are delivered to the base station(s). We then use our algorithms to perform an empirical analysis that quantifies the performance gains and losses of the splittable and unsplittable traffic allocation strategies for wireless sensor networks with delayconstrained traffic. Our experiments show that splitting traffic does not provide a significant advantage in energy consumption, but can afford strategies for relaying data with a lower delay penalty when using a model based on soft-delay constraints.

In this paper, we initiate a study to investigate the feasibility of distributed relay beamforming (DRBF) in a TP-WNP with the aim to enhance its reliability (and latency) performance even further. Specifically, we consider employing &# 36;N&# 36; i) amplify-and- forward (AF), ii) decode-and-forward (DF) relays in a {{wireless network}} running a TP-WNP. The relays operate in FDD mode, and do distributed transmit beamforming to realize low-latency, highly- reliable communication between each of the &# 36;M&# 36; source- destination pairs in the TP-WNP (a. k. a TDMA) system. The enablers/pre-requisites for the proposed DRBF-TDMA system are frequency, phase and timing synchronization among the relay nodes.

By rewriting the rate maximization problem {{with a set of}} auxiliary variables, we apply the P-BSUM algorithm to the rate maximization problem in the general case.

For reducing the transmission delay and the duplicate transmission, in this paper, we propose the delay based duplication transmission avoid (DDA) coordination scheme for opportunistic routing. In this coordination scheme, the candidate relaying nodes are divided into different fully connected relaying networks, so the duplicate transmission is avoided. Moreover, we propose the relaying network recognition algorithm which can be used to judge whether the sub-network is fully connected or not. The properties of the relaying networks are investigated in detail in this paper. When the fully connected relaying networks are got, they will be the basic units in the next hop relaying network selection. In this paper, we prove that the packet delivery ratio of the high priority relaying nodes in the relaying network has greater effection on the <b>relaying</b> <b>delay</b> than that of the low priority relaying nodes.
