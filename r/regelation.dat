6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] exclaimed the Professor, again smiling blandly, [...] "there {{you have}} touched what once was, and, to some {{philosophers}} it seems, still is, the great difficulty. By some great men {{it has been}} held that glacier ice is always in a partially soft, viscid, or semi-fluid condition, somewhat like pitch, so that, although apparently a solid, brittle, and rigid body, it flows sluggishly in reality. Other philosophers have denied this theory, insisting that the ice of glaciers is not like pitch, but like glass, and that it cannot be squeezed without being broken, nor drawn without being cracked. These philosophers have discovered that when ice is subjected to great pressure it melts, and that, when the pressure is removed, the part so melted immediately freezes again--hence the name <b>regelation,</b> or re-freezing, {{is given to the}} process. Thus a glacier, they say, is in many places being continually melted and continually and instantaneously re-frozen, so that it is made to pass through narrow gorges, and to open out again when the enormous pressure has been removed. But this theory of <b>regelation,</b> although unquestionably true, and although it exercises some influence on glacier motion, does not, in my opinion, alone account for it. The opinion which seems to be most in favour among learned men--and that which I myself hold firmly--is, the theory of the Scottish Professor Forbes, namely, that a glacier is a semi-fluid body, it is largely impregnated throughout its extent with water, its particles move round and past each other--in other words, it flows in precisely the same manner as water, the only difference being that it is not quite so fluid; it is sluggish in its flow, but it certainly models itself to the ground over which it is forced by its own gravity, and it is only rent or broken into fragments when it is compelled to turn sharp angles, or to pass over steep convex slopes. Forbes, by his careful measurements and investigations, proved incontestably that in some glaciers the central portion travelled down its valley at double or treble the rate of its sides, without the continuity of the mass being broken. In small masses, indeed, glacier-ice is to all appearance rigid, but on a large scale it is unquestionably ductile." ...|$|E

Much of the early scientific work on glacier motion had been done by Forbes, but Forbes at that time didn't know of the phenomenon of <b>Regelation</b> which was discovered a little later by Michael Faraday. <b>Regelation</b> {{played a key role}} in Tyndall's explanation. Forbes didn't see <b>regelation</b> in the same way at all. Complicating their debate, a disagreement arose publicly over who deserved to get investigator credit for what. Articulate friends of Forbes, as well as Forbes himself, thought that Forbes should get the credit for most of the good science, whereas Tyndall thought the credit should be distributed more widely. Tyndall commented: [...] "The idea of semi-fluid motion belongs entirely to Louis Rendu; the proof of the quicker central flow belongs in part to Rendu, but almost wholly to Louis Agassiz and Forbes; the proof of the retardation of the bed belongs to Forbes alone; while the discovery of the locus of the point of maximum motion belongs, I suppose, to me." [...] When Forbes and Tyndall were in the grave, their disagreement was continued by their respective official biographers. Everyone tried to be reasonable, but agreement wasn't attained. More disappointingly, aspects of glacier motion remained not understood or not proved.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Regelation</b> is the {{phenomenon}} of melting under pressure and freezing again when the pressure is reduced. Many sources state that <b>regelation</b> can be demonstrated by looping a fine wire around a block of ice, with a heavy weight attached to it. The pressure exerted on the ice slowly melts it locally, permitting the wire {{to pass through the}} entire block. The wire's track will refill as soon as pressure is relieved, so the ice block will remain solid even after wire passes completely through. This experiment is possible for ice at −10 °C or cooler, and while essentially valid, the details of the process by which the wire passes through the ice are complex. [...] The phenomenon works best with high thermal conductivity materials such as copper, since latent heat of fusion from the top side needs to be transferred to the lower side to supply latent heat of melting.|$|E

5000|$|In this way, {{plucking}} {{has been}} linked to <b>regelation.</b> Rocks of all sizes can become trapped {{in the bottom of the}} glacier. Joint blocks up to three meters have been [...] "plucked" [...] and transported. These entrained rock fragments can also cause abrasion along the subsequent bedrock and walls. Plucking also leads to chatter marks, wedge shaped indentations left on the bedrock or other rock surfaces. Glacial plucking both exploits pre-existing fractures in the bedrock and requires continued fracturing to maintain the cycle of erosion. Glacial plucking is most significant where the rock surface is well jointed or fractured or where it contains exposed bed planes, as this allows meltwater and clasts to penetrate more easily.|$|E

40|$|Among the {{processes}} that may entrain sediment in the bases of glaciers and ice sheets, basal ice may regelate downward into the pores of unlithified sediment. Laboratory studies suggest that this process leaves interstitial ice with a distribution of δ 18 O and δD that is distinct from that developed due to downward freezing of a semi-closed water reservoir. Although {{as a result of}} both processes these isotopes lie on a freezing slope in a δD-δ 18 O diagram, debris layers entrained by <b>regelation</b> past grains are both enriched in heavy isotopes with depth and display a downward decrease in deuterium excess, the converse of that due to downward freezing of a water reservoir. Moreover, the extent of enrichment can be significantly larger in the case of <b>regelation</b> into the bed.

The two primary mechanisms responsible for the formation of segregated ice on Earth, thermally induced <b>regelation</b> and hydraulic fracturing, are reviewed while their potential importance on Mars is examined. While <b>regelation</b> is the dominant terrestrial process, it requires a warmer and wetter environment than currently exists on Mars. In this respect, the conditions required for hydraulic fracturing are less demanding. In assessing its potential importance on Mars, it is noted that hydraulic fracturing can produce a localized zone of high pressure water that could readily disrupt an overburden of frozen ground.

40|$|Summary A tunnel {{excavated}} {{into the}} margin of Taylor Glacier revealed a basal sequence containing a thick sequence of layers of clean clear ice and debris-rich ice which contained strong deformation features, as well as units of clean bubbly ice. Analysis of the isotopic composition of the basal ice shows a strong linear relationship that plots on a slope of 8, which is usually interpreted as meteoric in origin. However, the physical appearance of the laminated ice is inconsistent with a meteoric-origin interpretation and has the outward appearance of ice usually inferred {{as the product of}} basal melt-refreeze processes like <b>regelation.</b> We consider this apparent tension between physical appearance and isotopic composition of the Taylor Glacier basal ice to be a limitation of the stable isotope approach, and that the technique employed here is unable to diagnose small-scale processes like <b>regelation...</b>|$|E

These worms form soft, free-standing aqueous hydrogels at 15 % w/w solids.

This causes a subtle change in the copolymer packing parameter which induces a worm-to-sphere morphological transition and hence leads to in situ degelation at pH 3. This order-order transition was characterised by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and gel rheology studies. On returning to pH 7, <b>regelation</b> is observed at 15 % w/w solids, indicating the reversible nature of the transition. However, such diblock copolymer worm gels remain intact when acidified in the presence of electrolyte, since the terminal cationic charge arising from the protonated morpholine end-groups is screened under these conditions.

It {{was published in}} the open access journal, Geophysical Research Abstracts, which contains abstracts only and is available from: [URL] facies basal ice (massive ice with dispersed debris aggregates) outcrops at the margins of many ice masses and is important to glaciologists because of the information it provides about the nature of subglacial conditions and processes in the deep interior of glaciers and ice sheets. There has been little agreement, however, about how it forms with possible mechanisms including <b>regelation</b> and water flow through the intercrystalline vein network, strain-induced metamorphism of firnified glacier ice, shearing of basal debris-rich ice, freeze-on of subglacial water, and incorporation of surface debris into glacier ice.

The basal ice is distinctly richer in Ca and Mg but slightly poorer in Na and K than the overlying glacier ice. The relative enrichment of Ca and Mg in basal ice appears {{to result from}} the limited incorporation of solutes as the ice forms by refreezing of pressure meltwaters that have flowed in intimate contact with the carbonate bedrock underlying the glacier. Because {{the bulk of the}} solutes are selectively rejected by the growing ice, they tend to accumulate in freezing subglacial waters until they eventually precipitate in areas where basal freezing is localized. This subglacial precipitation of CaCO 3 results in thin superficial coatings of calcite that are abundant and particularly well developed in small concavities of the bedrock surfaces recently exposed by the retreat of the Tsanfleuron Glacier. Calculated minimum solute concentrations required to maintain such CaCO 3 precipitation used in conjunction with an experimentally determined effective distribution coefficient, which characterizes the solute partitioning during the growth, can yield estimates of the Ca content of the <b>regelation</b> ice. The close agreement obtained between predicted and measured Ca contents in basal ice strongly supports the hypothesis that ice layers {{at the base of the}} Tsanfleuron Glacier are formed, at least in part, by <b>regelation</b> and that the calcite deposits result from the selective solute rejection that accompanies basal ice growth. © 1978 Geological Society of America.

The varnish is hard, thin (&# 60; 10 μm) and consists of an iron/manganese deposit, greatly enriched in these elements compared with the composition of the underlying gabbroic bedrock.
