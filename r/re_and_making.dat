40|$|Increasingly, {{political}} actors {{have to act}} in online communication environments. There they meet overlapping networked publics with different levels of participatory cultures and varying expectations {{of participation in the}} (<b>re)</b> <b>making</b> <b>and</b> co-production of political content. This challenges {{political actors}} used to a top-down approach to communication. Meanwhile, online users are increasingly politically involved as legislatures all over the world become more active in regulating communication environments online. These new political actors often share participatory practices and have high levels of new media skills. Now they are challenged to adapt these bottom-up participatory cultures to the traditional political environment. This paper examines these adaption processes by examining three examples from the campaign for the German federal election of 2009. These examples include the attempt of Germany's conservative party (CDU) to encourage their supporters to adapt participatory practices, the German Social Democrats' (SPD) top-down production and distribution of online content that mimicked {{the look and feel of}} user-generated content, and the bottom-up emergence of political flash mobs...|$|R
40|$|Although {{relationship}} education (<b>RE)</b> <b>and</b> couples therapy (CT) {{have similar}} goals in helping build and sustain healthy couple and family relationships, there remains confusion between the focus {{and structure of}} the two services. Literature on the marketing of family programs indicates that the awareness level of the target audience should dictate marketing and recruitment messages. Lack of awareness regarding <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> confusion over the difference between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> CT most likely affects the decision to attend. In order to inform <b>RE</b> recruitment <b>and</b> marketing approaches, this study investigated overall perceptions of <b>RE,</b> <b>RE</b> awareness, <b>and</b> confusion regarding the difference between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> CT in a sample of 1, 977 individuals. Differences in perceptions were also explored by relationship satisfaction and gender. Results showed a fairly high lack of awareness of <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> confusion between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> CT. Results also showed that respondents in more satisfying relationships see <b>RE</b> less positively, <b>and</b> men see <b>RE</b> less positively than women.

40|$|The {{disciplines}} of requirements engineering (<b>RE)</b> <b>and</b> software architecture (SA) are {{fundamental to the}} success of software projects. Even though <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> SA are often considered separately, {{it has been argued that}} drawing a line between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> SA is neither feasible nor reasonable as requirements and architectural design processes impact each other. Requirements are constrained by what is feasible technically and also by time and budget restrictions. On the other hand, feedback from the architecture leads to renegotiating architecturally significant requirements with stakeholders. The topic of bridging <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> SA has been discussed in both the <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> SA communities, but mostly independently. Therefore, the motivation for this ICSE workshop is to bring both communities together in order to identify key issues, explore the state of the art in research and practice, identify emerging trends, and define challenges related to the transition and the relationship between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> SA. ...|$|R
40|$|Context: Requirements {{engineering}} (<b>RE)</b> <b>and</b> Verification {{and validation}} (V&V) areas are treated {{to be integrated}} and assure successful development of the software project. Therefore, activation of both competences {{in the early stages}} of the project will support products in meeting the customer expectation regarding the quality and functionality. However, this quality can be achieved by aligning <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> V&V. There are different practices such as requirements, verification, validation, control, tool etc. that are followed by organizations for alignment and to address different challenges faced during the alignment between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> V&V. However, there is a requisite for studies to understand the alignment practices, challenges and factors, which can enable successful alignment between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> V&V. Objectives: In this study, an exploratory investigation is carried out to know the impact of factors i. e. <b>RE</b> process <b>and</b> organizational factors during the alignment between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> V&V. The main objectives of this study are: To find the list of RE practices that facilitate alignment between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> V&V. To categorize RE practices with respect to their requirement phases. To find the list of <b>RE</b> process <b>and</b> organizational factors that influence alignment between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> V&V besides their impact. To identify the challenges that are faced during the alignment between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> V&V. To obtain list of challenges that are addressed by RE practices during the alignment between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> V&V. Methods: In this study Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is conducted using snowballing procedure to identify the relevant information about RE practices, challenges, <b>RE</b> process factors <b>and</b> organizational factors. The studies were captured from Engineering Village database. Rigor and relevance analysis is performed to assess the quality of the studies obtained through SLR. Further, a questionnaire intended for industrial survey was prepared from the gathered literature and distributed to practitioners from the software industry in order to collect empirical information about this study. Thereafter, data obtained from industrial survey was analyzed using statistical analysis and chi-square significance test. Results: 20 studies were identified through SLR, which are relevant to this study. After analyzing the obtained studies, the list of RE process factors, organizational factors, challenges <b>and</b> <b>RE</b> practices during alignment between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> V&V are gathered. Thereupon, an industrial survey is conducted from the obtained literature, which has obtained 48 responses. Alignment between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> V&V possess an impact of <b>RE</b> process factors <b>and</b> organizational factors and this is also mentioned by the respondents of the survey. Moreover, this study finds an additional <b>RE</b> process factors <b>and</b> organizational factors during the alignment between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> V&V, besides their impact. Another contribution is, addressing the unaddressed challenges by RE practices obtained through the literature. Additionally, validation of categorized RE practices with respect to their requirement phases is carried out. Conclusions: To conclude, the obtained results from this study will benefit practitioners for capturing more insight towards the alignment between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> V&V. This study identified the impact of <b>RE</b> process factors <b>and</b> organizational factors during the alignment between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> V&V along with the importance of challenges faced during the alignment between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> V&V. This study also addressed the unaddressed challenges by RE practices obtained through literature. Respondents of the survey believe that many <b>RE</b> process <b>and</b> organizational factors have negative impact on the alignment between <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> V&V based on the size of an organization. In addition to this, validation of results for applying RE practices at different requirement phases is toted through survey. Practitioners can identify the benefits from this research and researchers can extend this study to remaining alignment practices...|$|R

Existing along a broad narrative spectrum, from "aadizookaanag "(traditional or sacred narratives) to "dibaajimowinan "(histories and news) [...] as well as everything in between [...] storytelling {{is one of the}} central practices and methods of individual and community existence. Stories create and understand, survive and endure, revitalize and persist. They honor the past, recognize the present, and provide visions of the future. In remembering, (<b>re)</b> <b>making,</b> <b>and</b> (<b>re)</b> writing stories, Anishinaabeg storytellers have forged a well-traveled path of agency, resistance, and resurgence. Respecting this tradition, this groundbreaking anthology features twenty-four contributors who utilize creative and critical approaches to propose that this people's stories carry dynamic answers to questions posed within Anishinaabeg communities, nations, and the world at large. Examining a range of stories and storytellers across time and space, each contributor explores how narratives form a cultural, political, and historical foundation for Anishinaabeg Studies. Written by Anishinaabeg and non-Anishinaabeg scholars, storytellers, and activists, these essays draw upon the power of cultural expression to illustrate active and ongoing senses of Anishinaabeg life. They are new and dynamic bagijiganan, revealing a viable and sustainable center for Anishinaabeg Studies, what it has been, what it is, what it can be...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The study's aim was {{to compare}} {{response}} entropy (<b>RE)</b> <b>and</b> state entropy (SE) with bispectral index (BIS) electroencephalography (EEG) as an alternative cerebral monitoring tool in patients scheduled for {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery. DESIGN: Prospective, observational single-center study. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery receiving remifentanil-propofol anesthesia. INTERVENTIONS: Surgery was performed with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cardiac arrest in 15 patients, with CPB without cardiac arrest in 9 patients and without CPB in 6 patients. MEASUREMENTS <b>AND</b> MAIN RESULTS: <b>RE,</b> SE, BIS, burst suppression ratio (BSR), and frontal electromyography (f-EMG) were detected simultaneously. <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> SE compared favorably with BIS and their correlations were strong (r(2) = 0. 6, r(2) = 0. 55, respectively). The mean bias of <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> BIS was - 1. 8, but limits of agreement were high (+ 20. 5 /- 24. 1). <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> SE tended to be lower than the BIS values in the CPB subgroups. The detection of BSR was similar with <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> SE and the BIS. A strong correlation existed between BIS and f-EMG (r(2) = 0. 62) in contrast to RE (r(2) = 0. 45) and SE (r(2) = 0. 39). BIS monitoring was significantly more disturbed than <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> SE with 9. 1 % +/- 10. 9 % and 0. 1 % +/- 0. 2 % of the total anesthesia time, respectively. Neither implicit nor explicit memory was shown. CONCLUSION: <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> SE are comparable with the BIS but showed significantly less interference from f-EMG and superior resistance against artifacts. Thus, spectral entropy is more suitable than the BIS during propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in cardiac surgery patients...|$|R

40|$|Friedewald’s formula (FF) is {{the most}} widely used formula in {{clinical}} practice to calculate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) from total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC). But this formula frequently underestimates LDLC. The aim {{of this study was to}} derive a regression equation (RE) to abolish the underestimation and to compare the performance of <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> FF in Bangladeshi population. RE was derived from 531 lipid profiles (equation derivation group) for the calculation of LDLC by multiple linear regression analysis. The RE was then used to calculate LDLC in another 952 subjects (equation validation group). LDLC calculated by <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> FF were compared with measured LDLC by appropriate statistical analyses. In equation validation group, measured LDLC, LDLC calculated by <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> FF were 2. 97 ± 0. 81, 2. 91 ± 0. 80 and 2. 72 ± 0. 93 mmol/L respectively. Precision (r) was 0. 9525 for <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> 0. 9193 for FF. Passing & Bablok linear regression equations against measured LDLC were y = 0. 9792 x + 0. 007 for <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> y = 1. 1412 x – 0. 6781 for FF.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Bi{{spectral}} Index (BIS) and spectral entropy of the electroencephalogram {{can be used}} {{to assess}} the depth of hypnosis. Ketamine is known to increase BIS in anaesthetized patients and may confound that index as a guide to steer administration of hypnotics. We compared the effects of ketamine on BIS, response entropy (<b>RE)</b> <b>and</b> state entropy (SE) during surgery under sevoflurane anaesthesia. METHODS: Twenty-two women undergoing gynaecological surgery were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized study. Anaesthesia was induced i. v. and maintained with sevoflurane. Under stable surgical and anaesthetic conditions, patients were assigned to receive either a bolus of ketamine 0. 5 mg kg(- 1) or the same volume of saline. Blood pressure, heart rate, BIS, <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> SE were measured every 2. 5 min from 10 min before (baseline) until 15 min after ketamine or saline administration. The maximum relative increase in BIS, <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> SE compared with baseline was calculated for each patient. Values are mean (sd). RESULTS: Baseline values were BIS 33 (4), RE 31 (5), SE 30 (5) for the ketamine patients and BIS 35 (3), <b>RE</b> 33 (5) <b>and</b> SE 32 (6) for the patients receiving saline. BIS, <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> SE increased significantly from 5 min (BIS) and 2. 5 min (<b>RE</b> <b>and</b> SE) after ketamine administration, peaking at 46 (8) (BIS), 52 (12) (<b>RE)</b> <b>and</b> 50 (12) (SE) respectively. The maximum relative increase in RE [42. 2 (10. 4 %) ] and SE [41. 6 (10. 9) %] was higher than that of BIS [29. 4 (10. 4 %) ]. Blood pressure, heart rate and RE-SE gradient did not change in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine administered under sevoflurane anaesthesia causes a significant increase in BIS, <b>RE</b> <b>and</b> SE without modification of the RE-SE gradient. This increase is paradoxical in that it is associated with a deepening level of hypnosis. Peer reviewe...|$|R
