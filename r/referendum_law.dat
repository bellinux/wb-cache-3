25|$|Within {{the next}} two days, nearly 74% of Catalan municipalities—comprising about 43% of the Catalan population—had agreed to provide the {{necessary}} polling stations for the referendum, whereas many of the most-populated urban areas—representing 24% of Catalan inhabitants—had voiced {{their opposition to the}} vote. The largest city and capital of Catalonia, Barcelona—accounting for about 20% of the region's population—was caught in the middle, with its local mayor, Ada Colau, refusing to make a statement whether the municipality would provide logistic support to the referendum or not while rejecting putting public servants at risk; she, however, voiced her support for the people's right to vote in a fair and legal referendum. Concurrently, President of Catalonia Carles Puigdemont, Vice-President Oriol Junqueras, the entire Catalan government as well as parliamentary officials allowing the <b>referendum</b> <b>law</b> to be put to vote in Parliament—including Parliament Speaker Carme Forcadell—faced charges of disobedience, misusing public funds and making deliberately unlawful decisions as elected officials as the High Court of Justice of Catalonia agreed to hear the criminal complaints filled by state prosecutors.|$|E
2500|$|They {{were rewarded}} for {{this in the}} 1994 general {{election}} in which the party doubled its number of seats to twenty-four. D66 was able to form its 'dream coalition', the Purple government, which combined the social-democratic PvdA, and the conservative-liberal VVD. The first Kok cabinet initiated legislation, which the D66 has always advocated, such as the referendum, same-sex marriage and the legalisation of euthanasia. The [...] moderate liberal economic policies of the cabinet were also seen as a great success. Van Mierlo became Minister of Foreign Affairs. Before the election of 1998, Van Mierlo stepped back and Els Borst, the minister of health became the top candidate. D66 lost ten seats in the election, but its coalition partners won considerable ground {{at the cost of}} D66. The second Kok cabinet continued. Although D66 was numerically not necessary, it was seen as the glue that kept the two opposites of PvdA and VVD together. Borst stepped down as party leader and became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health. Thom de Graaf led the parliamentary party. Within the party, a group of age twenty-somethings called Opschudding (Upheaval) began to call for a more explicit progressive liberal course. In 1999 a constitutional reform, which would allow referendums was rejected by the Senate. A group of dissidents around the prominent VVD member Hans Wiegel had voted against. D66 left the cabinet. In the subsequent formation talks, D66 returned to the cabinet, in return for another important issue for D66, the directly elected mayor, and a temporary <b>referendum</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
