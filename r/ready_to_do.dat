5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} head, {{with a pair}} of large {{compound}} eyes, and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for lapping and sucking in the other groups. Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their source of their food. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.|$|E
5|$|News that Marc Anthony was {{recording}} an English-language album {{began in}} 1996 when RMM executive Ralph Mercado mentioned the possibility following a joint-venture between RMM (Anthony's former record label) and MCA Records. Anthony {{said that he}} would not record in English until he felt he was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. After the release of his third studio album Contra la Corriente in 1997, disputes over business practices arose between him and Mercado. Anthony suspected that he was not receiving full payment from his record label for his recordings. Mercado would not allow Anthony to leave the record label because his contract committed Anthony to record four more albums for RMM.|$|E

Producer Brian Grazer and Imagine {{executive}} Jim Whitaker decided against pursuing George's attempt and to return to Zaillian's vision. In February 2006, Ridley Scott entered talks with the studio to take over American Gangster from George, returning to Zaillian's draft as the film's basis. Washington returned to his role as Lucas, and Russell Crowe was attached to star as Roberts. Crowe {{was drawn to the}} project based on his previous work with the director on Gladiator and A Good Year, while Washington wanted to work with Crowe again, after 1995's Virtuosity.

It was, however, too late; the King had already made up his mind to go, even if he could not marry Simpson.

500|$|When Britain {{declared}} war on Germany at 23:00 Greenwich Mean Time on 4 August 1914, the British Empire's dominions and colonies automatically became involved as well. Word of this reached the Southern Rhodesian capital Salisbury during the night. Early on 5 August, the Company administrator Sir William Milton wired Whitehall: [...] "All Rhodesia united in devoted loyalty to King and Empire and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> its duty." [...] A few hours later he officially announced to the populace that Southern Rhodesia was at war. The Rhodesia Herald and Bulawayo Chronicle newspapers published special editions the same day to spread the news; it took about half a week for word to reach the whole country, but jingoistic demonstrations began in the major towns almost immediately.|$|E
500|$|When the United Kingdom {{declared}} war on Germany {{at the start of}} World War I in August 1914, settler society in Southern Rhodesia, then administered by the British South Africa Company, received the news with great patriotic enthusiasm. The Company administrator, Sir William Milton, wired the UK government, [...] "All Rhodesia... <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> its duty". Although it supported Britain, the Company was concerned about the possible financial implications for its chartered territory should it make direct commitments to the war effort, particularly at first, so most of the colony's contribution to the war was made by Southern Rhodesians individually—not only those who volunteered to fight abroad, but also those who remained at home and raised funds to donate food, equipment and other supplies.|$|E

Quintanilla, Selena's {{brother and the}} producer of her music, lead keyboardist for the band Ricky Vela, and Bebu Silvetti, an Argentine music producer. [...] "No debes jugar" [...] is a Mexican cumbia rock song that centers the organ as its musical instrument foundation. Ramiro Burr of the Houston Chronicle stated that Selena blended Mexican polka rhythms with melodic, synth-driven pop hooks in [...] "No debes jugar" [...] and [...] "La llamada". [...] "No debes jugar" [...] received a Song of the Year nomination at the 1994 Tejano Music Awards. [...] "No debes jugar" [...] is performed on F major with 89 beats per minute. Lyrically the song describes a woman whose life is centered on being unappreciated by her boyfriend.

It peaked at number three on the US Hot Latin Tracks, Latin Regional Mexican Airplay and the Latin Pop Airplay charts simultaneously.|$|E

During Five Forks General Pickett had been distracted by a shad bake, and Steuart was left {{in command of the}} infantry, as it bore the brunt of a huge Union assault, with General Sheridan leading around 30,000 men against Pickett's 10,000. The consequences were even more disastrous than at Spotsylvania the previous year, with at least 5,000 men falling prisoner to Sheridan's forces. The end of Confederate resistance was now just days away. At Sayler's Creek Lee's starving and exhausted army finally fell apart. Upon seeing the survivors streaming along the road, Lee exclaimed in front of Maj. Gen. William Mahone, [...] "My God, has the army dissolved?" [...] to which he replied, [...] "No, General, here are troops <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> their duty." ...|$|E
500|$|The role of {{the player}} {{character}} in the main quest was to be changed as well. In contrast to past games, where the player character would play a type of [...] "chosen one", Oblivion would have the player character [...] "find him, protect him, and help him." [...] Aside from that, {{in the opinion of}} Hines, [...] "the main quest has similar themes and tones as in past Elder Scrolls games", and should still feel [...] "epic", simply {{because of the way the}} gamespace is designed: with openness in mind. Improving that aspect of the experience, said Hines, came mostly in the form of improved information presentation. The system would not intrude on the experience when the player merely wishes to [...] "walk around and explore the world and do whatever he/she wants", but given the scenario where the player asks [...] "'OK, I'm <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the next part of the main quest, where do I go?'", the game would provide a ready answer, so as to avoid [...] "confusion" [...] and [...] "downtime".|$|E

500|$|Wallis's {{relationship}} with the King had become public knowledge in the United Kingdom by early December. She decided to flee the country as the scandal broke, and was driven {{to the south of}} France in a dramatic race to outrun the press. For the next three months, she was under siege by the media at the Villa Lou Viei, near Cannes, the home of her close friends Herman and Katherine Rogers. At her hideaway, Wallis was pressured by the King's Lord-in-Waiting, Lord Brownlow, to renounce the King. On 7 December 1936, Lord Brownlow read to the press her statement, which he had helped her draft, indicating Wallis's readiness to give up the King. However, Edward was determined to marry Wallis. John Theodore Goddard, Wallis's solicitor, stated: [...] client was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything to ease the situation but {{the other end of the}} wicket [...] was determined." [...] This seemingly indicated that the King had decided he had no option but to abdicate if he wished to marry Wallis.|$|E

The band knew former Pantera and Damageplan drummer Vinnie Paul, and tried to persuade him to join the band as their drummer. Originally, Paul was not sure if he would return to music {{after the death of his}} brother, Dimebag Darrell and an 18-month hiatus: [...] "It was one of those things that I didn't think I'd be apart of this ever again without him, and after about a year and a half had gone by, these guys called me up, Chad [...] and Tom , they were like, 'We're thinking about putting this band together, would you be into it?'
