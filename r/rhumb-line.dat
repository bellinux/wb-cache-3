50|$|The {{construction}} of the rhumb line system in the Cantino planisphere uses two circles (some charts use only one, others use as many as three, depending of size): the western circle is centered on the Cape Vert Islands, the eastern circle is centered in India. The circumference of each circle is marked with sixteen equally spaced points, from which radiate the 32 classic rhumbs: 0°, 11 1/4°, 22 1/2°, 33 3/4°, etc. The western and eastern outer circles are tangent to each other at a large wind-rose in central Africa, with a fleur-de-lis indicating North. This dense <b>rhumb-line</b> mesh was used in navigation as a reference, for reading and marking directions (courses) between places. Six scale bars graduated in Iberian leagues, with a variable number of sections (or logs), are distributed over the chart's area. These were used to measure distances between places.|$|E
40|$|In this work, control {{techniques}} for the autonomous navigation and landing of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) are developed and compared. Controllers were developed and implemented {{on two different}} aircraft models: the Lockheed-Martin F- 16 and AAI Corporation/Israel Aircraft Industries RQ- 2 Pioneer. Due to the expense of modifying the pre-existing F- 16 flight control system, the controller is implemented outside of the closed loop. Proportional-integral-derivative and proportional-integral controllers are developed for holding the aircraft at a desired velocity and altitude. The aircraft are approximated as Dubins vehicles constrained to travel on a two-dimensional surface for decreased simulation time. Using the simplified model two control techniques are developed and then compared. The first uses a proportional feedback controller based on the <b>Rhumb-line</b> that the aircraft is traveling along. The second control technique uses a trajectory determined from an algorithm using the Dubins path determination for the shortest travel distance between two points. A sliding mode controller is developed to guide the simplified model along the Dubins path trajectory. The advantage of the Dubins path trajectory {{is that it allows}} for a closed-form time estimate to reach the desired way-point. Comparison between the two navigation techniques using the simplified system shows a significant decrease in time to way-point for the Dubins curve trajectory controller. The <b>Rhumb-line</b> controller and a hybrid Rhumb-line/Dubins path controller are implemented on nonlinear models of both aircraft. Simulation of both controllers on the nonlinear model shows acceptable performance in guiding the aircraft between way-points. Also, the time to way-point for the nonlinear aircraft model guided by the hybrid controller is within 5 % of the closed-form Dubins trajectory estimate. Autonomous landing is accomplished utilizing the path guidance and altitude controllers. The nonlinear simulated aircraft successfully followed the glideslope from way-point to runway...|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} of a strap-down analog sun acquisition sensor (AS) and an on-board digital programmable signal processor results in a versatile guidance and control system. The combination can orient the rotation axis of a spin-stabilized spacecraft to the sun {{no matter what the}} initial attitude of the spacecraft. During the sun orientation process, spacecraft spin rate can be sensed and supplied as an input to the control algorithm. If needed, the AS-signal processor combination can be used to perform a <b>rhumb-line</b> turn maneuver. In case of unexpected spacecraft operating conditions, or unplanned pointing directions, the signal processor program can be updated via earth-based transmission of another program to cover the new situation. Using only three radiation-hard cadmium-sulfide detectors, containing no moving parts, needing only a few microwatts of power, included in a volume of 550 cubic cm (a redundant pair), and weighing only 540 grams, the AS is a small, simple, sturdy sensing device...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-Analysis of {{conventional}} data and of {{information provided by}} a number of the competing skippers yields an unusually detailed picture of environmental conditions during the Newport, R. 1. -Bermuda Yacht Race in June 1970. Sea-surface temperature data indicate the presence of a warm meander of the Gulf Stream just west of the <b>rhumb-line</b> course, a position intermediate between that of a warm meander to the west in May disclosed by bathythermograph observations from €he RMS Franconia and that of a warm eddy to the east in August found by a Naval Oceanographic Office survey. The fleet was harassed by two groups of severe thundersqualls during the night of June 21 - 22, {{in the vicinity of the}} warm meander. Even the anomalously high seasurface temperatures, however, were cool relative to the air in which the thunderstorms were rooted. The storms originated in the Chesapeake Bay area during the day on June 21, and they appeared, surprisingly, to gain intensity over the ocean after being cut off from their surface source of warmth and moisture. Offshore forecasts for June 21 - 22 took no specific account of the presence of the severe thunderstorm systems. On June 25, part of the fleet experienced an unexpected southerly gale just northwest of Bermuda. From the yacht data, it is found that the gale was attributable to a small cyclone that formed in an old frontal cloud band and moved northeastward, remaining undetected by the conventional data network throughout its life history. Analysis of the surface wind field suggests that baroclinic effects played only a minor role in the behavior of this cyclone, which at least ‘in some respects resembled a tropical cyclone. Study of the forecasts available at the time indicate that in neither case did small-scale convective activity have a significant direct effect upon the larger scales of motion...|$|E
