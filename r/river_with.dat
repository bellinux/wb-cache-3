50|$|River flood plains {{that contain}} <b>rivers</b> <b>with</b> a highly sinuous {{platform}} are populated by longer oxbow lakes {{than those with}} low sinuosity. This is because <b>rivers</b> <b>with</b> high sinuosity have larger meanders, and greater opportunity for longer lakes to form. <b>Rivers</b> <b>with</b> lower sinuosity are characterized by fewer cutoffs and shorter oxbow lakes due to the shorter distance of their meanders.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine distributions of freshwater mussels in relation to riparian vegetation within the drainage basin. Three <b>rivers</b> were chosen <b>with</b> grassy riparian zones (Avon R., McGregor Cr., Whirl Cr.) and three <b>rivers</b> were selected <b>with</b> forested riparian zones (Ausable R., Dingman Cr., Saugeen R.). In total, 17 unionid species were found within the study area. Grassy <b>rivers</b> <b>with</b> narrow, grass-dominated riparian zones were characterised by Pyganodon grandis and Strophitus undulatus whereas forested <b>rivers</b> <b>with</b> wider riparian zones were characterised by Elliptio dilatata, Lampsilis radiata, Lampsilis cardium and Fusconaia flava. Basin types did not differ in mean species numbers, however, a shift towards dominance by a single species was found in grassy <b>rivers</b> <b>with</b> over 60...|$|R

5|$|A {{boulevard}} to {{link the}} parks on Chicago's north and south sides was proposed as early as 1891.

In 1903 {{an editorial in the}} Chicago Tribune proposed a new bascule bridge across the river at Michigan Avenue. Other plans suggested that the bridge should be a replica of the Pont Alexandre III that spans the Seine in Paris, or that, rather than constructing an entirely new bridge, the existing Rush Street bridge should be double-decked.|$|E

5|$|About 2.5million {{people lived}} in the Willamette River basin as of 2010, about 65percent of the {{population}} of Oregon. As of 2009, the basin contained 20 of the 25 most populous cities in Oregon. These cities include Springfield, Eugene, Corvallis, Albany, Salem, Keizer, Newberg, Oregon City, West Linn, Milwaukie, Lake Oswego, and Portland. The largest is Portland, with more than 500,000 residents. Not all of these cities draw water directly from the Willamette for their municipal water supply. Other cities in the watershed (but not on the main-stem <b>river)</b> <b>with</b> populations of 20,000 or more are Gresham, Hillsboro, Beaverton, Tigard, McMinnville, Tualatin, Woodburn, and Forest Grove.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{traveled}} {{along the}} southeastern {{banks of the}} Richelieu River, up to Sorel, where he crossed that river and continued up the southern shore of the St. Lawrence to Longueuil. According to Allen's account, he met Brown there, {{and the two of}} them then hatched a plan to attack Montreal. Brown would cross the <b>river</b> <b>with</b> 200 men at La Prairie, upriver from Montreal, and Allen, with his Americans and 80 Canadians under the command of Loiseau and Duggan, two of Livingston's captains, would cross the river at Longueuil, below the city, and the two forces would, after a prearranged signal, converge on the city itself.|$|E
5|$|Although San Francisco {{had sought}} Tuolumne River water {{as early as}} the 1890s, this project did not move forward until the {{disastrous}} earthquake and fire of 1906, which underscored the insufficiency of the existing water supply. The Hetch Hetchy Valley – then compared to Yosemite Valley for its scenic beauty – was chosen for its water quality and hydroelectric potential, but the location within the national park generated controversy. An act of Congress was required to circumvent federal protection of the Tuolumne <b>River,</b> <b>with</b> the reasoning that public land should be developed for the public benefit.|$|E
