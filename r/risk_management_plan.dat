A framework published by a standards organization, such as Risk IT, CobiT, PCI DSS or ISO/IEC 27002, may guide development. Countermeasures may include technical tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software, policies and procedures requiring such controls as regular backups and configuration hardening, employee training in security awareness, or organizing personnel into dedicated computer emergency response team (CERT) or computer security incident response team (CSIRT). [...] The cost and benefit of each countermeasure is carefully considered. Thus, the IA practitioner does not seek to eliminate all risks, were that possible, but to manage them in the most cost-effective way.|$|E

There is a great deal of variability in the amount and detail of risk information collected by nurses and how this is used to develop <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>plans.</b> Keeping <b>risk</b> assessment information in one place rather than scattered throughout patient records is important for ensuring it can be accessed easily and linked properly to <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>plans.</b> Strengthening the link between <b>risk</b> assessment and <b>management</b> will help ensure interventions and care is tailored to the specific needs of individual patients, thus promoting their safety and well-being.
