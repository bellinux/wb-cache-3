In order to get the attitude across and the intensity with the choreography they <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> slap each other. We had to change the styling to hide all the bruises, particularly on the thighs.|$|E
25|$|Roy Heffernan was {{a native}} Australian, born in Lithgow NSW, and was an avid {{weightlifter}} and bodybuilder in his teens. He was trained by his father, {{who was also a}} bodybuilder, and won the Mr. Australia title before making his wrestling debut at the age of twenty. Heffernan did not have an easy time moving up the ranks in Australian pro wrestling, as the belief at the time was that a wrestler <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go overseas to North America and learn to be a pro before the bookers would even consider moving them up the rankings of the promotion. After working on the lower cards in Australia, Heffernan left his home country in 1953 to come to America in the hopes of attaining more success there.|$|E

Matt Hammitt said, [...] "At that point, we <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do some soul searching and figure out where it was {{we were supposed to}} be ...

Despite the revelation, she told Entertainment Weekly in August 2011 {{that she wanted to}} be remembered for the song because she had to work hard to get it on Breakaway (2004) when everyone was against it. She added, [...] "I think I’m most proud of that song – just getting it on an album because no one liked it until it hit no. 1 worldwide and everybody was on board." ...|$|E
500|$|Daniel Hales, {{brother of}} the organisation's {{worldwide}} leader Bruce Hales, described the book {{as part of a}} trend of what he said were lies told about his group by critics and disaffected former members.

We're quite happy to have our beliefs questioned, ethically debated, and points of religion looked at. That's not a problem. We don't mind being criticised. We don't even mind being despised because of it. But once it starts to be charged that we're acting criminally, we're acting illegally, we're acting immorally, we're acting against society, then we felt that we <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> put our point of view. We felt that it wasn't fair to our members," [...] said Daniel Hales to The West Australian.|$|E

500|$|Hartley {{is quick}} to point out that before [...] "Justice", the series did not focus on [...] "the costumes and the capes, the flying and the superhero stuff", because they have their [...] "no flights, no tights" [...] rule in effect. That changed with [...] "Justice", and Hartley {{suggested}} that the actors <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> commit themselves to their roles while wearing the costumes, [...] "otherwise you look like a standup comedian who doesn't like his jokes very much". Young stated that he was one of the luckiest out of the group, because he only had to wear a silver vest and regular pants, unlike Ritchson, who had to put on a [...] "onesie Speedo". Ritchson felt you could get distracted by what you were wearing, but it was best to try to take your mind off of the subject. Hartley, Ritchson, and Young stated that they felt sorry for Gallner for having to wear a costume that they believed [...] "sucked".

[...] He read the script and found it to be [...] "very well written, comprehensive but you <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> have Chris in person, to try to articulate {{some of the things that}} have been swirling around his head for the last eight years." [...] DiCaprio and Nolan spent months talking about the screenplay. Nolan took a long time re-writing the script in order [...] "to make sure that the emotional journey of his character was the driving force of the movie." [...] On February 11, 2009, it was announced that Warner Bros. purchased Inception, a spec script written by Nolan.|$|E

500|$|Victoria Principal {{has said}} that she feels Pam changed {{throughout}} the course of the series. She commented, [...] "Pam didn’t have two parents, her father was a drunkard, and she <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fight for everything she aspired to and achieved. When Bobby married her, he wasn’t marrying milk toast; she was very, very spirited; she was always a good person. I always felt Pam was the moral centre of the programme but she was complicated, and she was fiery, she had opinions, and she was not afraid to voice them. But as the years went by, as JR became more and more evil, the writers felt, and I certainly understand why {{for the benefit of the}} show, that Pam had to become more and more good." [...] When asked about whether she had any input on her characters growth, she said: [...] "Once the show achieved extraordinary world wide fame, I don’t think any of us had much input.

500|$|As {{reported}} in the German magazine Der Spiegel, the première (and only performance to date) on 15 November 1969 of Stockhausen's work Fresco for four orchestral groups (playing in four different locations) {{was the scene of}} a scandal. The rehearsals were already marked by objections from the orchestral musicians questioning such directions as [...] "glissandos no faster than one octave per minute" [...] and others phoning the artists union to clarify whether they <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> perform the Stockhausen work as part of the orchestra. In the backstage warm-up room at the premiere a hand-lettered sign could be seen saying: [...] "We're playing, otherwise we would be [...] ". During the première the parts on some music stands suddenly were replaced by placards reading things like [...] "Stockhausen-Zoo. Please don't feed", that someone had planted. Some musicians, fed up with the monkeyshines, left after an hour, though the performance was planned for four to five hours. Stockhausen fans protested, while Stockhausen foes were needling the musicians asking: [...] "How can you possibly participate in such crap?" [...] ("Wie könnt ihr bloß so eine Scheiße machen!"). At one point someone managed to switch off the stand lights, leaving the musicians in the dark. After 260 minutes the performance ended with nobody participating any more [...]|$|E
500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} and second unit director David Leitch {{compared it to}} a [...] "Jackie Chan hybrid of comedy and action." [...] Prior to the filming, Leitch organized a month-long boot camp in order to prepare Renner and Arterton (who said she was also glad that at least she could use her prior training that she received while studying at RADA) with extensive weapons, fight and stunt training. Janssen said she enjoyed [...] "flying", something that she always wanted to do, adding that despite her reputation as an action star {{it was the first}} film where she <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do something physical (including suffering a minor accident on the set), because she could not use a double in the close-up scenes where she had the makeup on. During one of the scenes, where Gretel is thrown through a wall and falls down several meters, a stunt double for Arterton was dangerously injured when a nail got lodged in her skull close to the brain; Arterton said she initially wanted to do this stunt herself but Wirkola would not let her. Arterton herself suffered an injury when she sprained her ankle while running through the forest. Stunts for the more aggressive witches were done by New Zealander stuntwoman and actress Zoë Bell. Renner did practically all of his stunt scenes himself.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] was {{directed}} by the American photographer Herb Ritts, and shot at Key Biscayne in Miami, Florida {{in the last week}} of January 2001. Spears revealed she was inspired by Janet Jackson's video for [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)"(1990) to select Ritts as the video's director. According to Ritts, the singer [...] "wanted to do something fresh. There was one outfit, no dancing, and that meant that it boiled down to her. She <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> act the song, and she was very impressive." [...] He also revealed that the video was set at [...] "a funky beach shack" [...] similar to the videos for Madonna's [...] "Cherish" [...] (1989) and Chris Isaak's [...] "Wicked Game" [...] (1989). [...] "The story is, pretty much, Britney longing for him to tell her the words", said Ritts, who was impressed with the chemistry between the singer and her fictional boyfriend, played by French model Brice Durand. Spears' real-life boyfriend at the time Justin Timberlake, however, [...] "was said to be miffed at Spears' kissing scenes with French model," [...] according to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV. Spears mother, Lynne, also criticized considered the original music video for being too racy at the time, because it contained sexually explicit material. Parts of the video were edited before its release to the public.|$|E
