40|$|This article {{seeks to}} answer a {{frequently}} asked question in competition law. Where a cartelist sells to a direct purchaser who passes on the loss to a third party, {{to what extent can}} the cartelist avail himself of a defence that the direct purchaser has passed on the loss, and can the consumer have a direct cause of action against the cartelist? The paper explores how established principles of tort and unjust enrichment can provide an answer to this without distorting settled principles of substantive law and procedure. A. INTRODUCTION Lately there has been significant interest among the competition law community in the private enforcement of competition law. In the English courts private enforcement is possible as either a follow-on action, where a public enforcement body (the Office of Fair Trading in the UK) has already launched a successful action, 1 or a standalone action in the Chancery Division, where there is no public enforcement. 2 Where an undertaking breaks competition law either under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“ TFEU”) or the Competition Act 1998, the claimant may bring an action for breach of statutory duty. This is more controversial than sometimes acknowledged, but for our purposes we will accept the proposition. 3 When, therefore, for example, a cartelist sells to the direct purchaser at an illegal anticompetitive overcharge, he breaches his statutory duty under the Competition Act 1998, s. 2 or under the European Communities Act 1972, s. 2 (1) in those cases where TFEU, Art. 101 is engaged. The problem with which we are primarily concerned in this paper is where a cartelist (“C”) sells to a direct purchaser (“DP”) who then sells on to an indirect purchaser end user (“ IP”). An important debate takes place around the question whether IP has a cause of action against C. Linked to this is the question whether, if DP sues C, C can claim that DP has passed on its loss and therefore has no <b>recoverable</b> <b>losses,</b> or diminished losses...|$|R

Second, the primary concern of the WIM should be compensatory justice. In case of climate L&D, three aspects of compensatory justice should be kept separate: corrective liability, remedial responsibility, and with regard to the resources available, fair remedy.

It will do so by surveying a number of critical issues, not all, posed by the law of damages under the Convention.

A number of authors have made significant contributions to the subject of damages under the Convention, but the impression remains that the subject has received less attention than is warranted by its theoretical and practical importance. The paper therefore deals with important issues, not all of which have yet had the attention they merit from the case law and literature.

40|$|When {{speaking}} of damages in Tort law Salmond & Heuston state “[i]t is often discussed whether the governing principle {{is that of}} restitutio in integrum, or whether the defendant is only obliged to give the plaintiff fair compensation”. It would seem that in most situations where damages are assessed the courts consider fair compensation to be a monetary sum, based on actuarial evidence, which would amount to restitutio in integrum. Thus, in practice, {{the distinction between the}} principles is often blurred. However, some specific situations call for a deeper examination of the concept of fair compensation. A recent example is Byrne v Ryan where the Irish High Court was faced with determining what would constitute fair compensation for the negligent performance of a sterilisation operation.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the history and}} contemporaneous common law position on the recovery of opportunity costs associated with money sums which are paid late or otherwise withheld from proper payment by defendants. Economics and finance define opportunity cost as 2 ̆ 7 the next most profitable employment of an asset 2 ̆ 7, but this definition has only recently been recognised in Australian courts. Since {{the formation of the}} common law in the post-Conquest era, opportunity costs have not been recognised in litigation as <b>recoverable</b> <b>losses.</b> In contrast, opportunity costs have been recognised by courts when associated with tangible assets such as land or goods through the action of mesne profits. The origin of the dichotomy stems from the religious influence of the church during the crucial formation period of the common law, coupled with the view that lending at interest in any form was the hateful sin of usury. The use of clerics as judges and the monopoly which the church enjoyed over the instruments of learning gave the church unmistakeable and plenary power over the common law processes, a power which is seen through the rules of both evidence and law which permeated early courts and lingers within the modem common law courts. The dichotomy of treatment between real assets and money was entrenched through the doctrine of stare decisis in the seminal 1829 case of Page v Newman which became known for the principle that no common law court had the power to award interest on an overdue sum of money in the absence of clear contractual terms or recognition of trade practice such as bills of exchange. This hindered commercial practice in Europe and England for centuries, stifling enterprise and subjecting plaintiffs to systemic injustice from unscrupulous defendants. This thesis assigns a stipulative definition of 2 ̆ 7 classification dilemma 2 ̆ 7 to the divergent common law treatment of the opportunity costs of assets and money. This dilemma existed until partially resolved by the High Court of Australia in 1989 through the case of ii Hungerfords v Walker, which recognized the common law action for the loss of the use of money. The religious legacy, however, still lingers through the evidential burden and the rules of 2 ̆ 7 remoteness 2 ̆ 7 which influence the recovery of damages in the litigious process, for Christianity formed {{an integral part of the}} common law from the formation period. Therefore, the fundamental methodology of the common law is antithetical in many respects to the commercial paradigm of economics and finance...|$|R
40|$|Many {{offshore}} installations {{are dependent on}} power generated by gas turbines and a critical issue is that these experience performance deterioration over time. Performance deterioration causes reduced plant efficiency and power output as well as increased environmental emissions. It is therefore of highest importance to detect and control <b>recoverable</b> <b>losses</b> {{in order to reduce}} their effect. This thesis project was therefore initiated to evaluate parameters for detecting performance deterioration in addition to document different aspects of gas turbine degradation and performance recovery. Compressor fouling is the largest contributor to performance deterioration. Investigating fouling was therefore the main focus of this study. In the present study the deterioration rates of four different gas turbines were evaluated. When choosing gas turbines it was emphasised to select gas turbines operating under equal conditions but with different washing procedures. In addition to offline washing two of the gas turbines had daily online washing routines and one of the gas turbines run idle wash every 1000 hour between each offline wash. Data was extracted from the monitoring software, TurboWatch, and loaded into Excel files. MATLAB scripts were created to handle the large amount of data and visualize performance trends. Series of two parameters were plotted against each other and the graphs were evaluated. The evaluation showed that an overall trend was that the gas turbine that had been running with online washing continuously {{over a long period of}} time had higher performance than the reference engine. For the second gas turbine a daily online washing procedure has recently started. The advantage with the evaluation of this gas turbine was that a good reference engine was available. The two engines were operating under quite similar conditions at the same location in addition to having equal filter systems. Some deterioration trends were possible to detect. For the first period both engines seemed to have quite equal deterioration trends. During the second period no clear trends were seen in corrected CDP and corrected EGT when evaluated for constant GG speed. The compressor efficiency had decreasing trends for both engines during the second period as well, but the compressor efficiency for machine 1 was overall higher during the period with online washing than the previous period. The borescope pictures taken after the first period with online washing showed good visual results. However, it is too premature to make a final decision regarding the exact performance gain of online washing. At the time the study was performed the engine had only been running online washing for one operating interval, and more investigation over longer time is recommended. For the engine running with idle wash it was not possible to conclude on the basis of the collected data. No clear deterioration trends were detected and investigations over longer time and several operating intervals are recommended. It is also important to be aware of the fact that the performance gain of idle wash needs to be much higher than for online washing in order for idle wash to be economically profitable. There are several uncertainties related to performance trends. These include inaccuracy in instrumentation, monitoring software, calibration etc. Due to the fact that all the gas turbines evaluated in this study only have standard instrumentation it caused additional uncertainty in the performance trends. One suggestion for further study is to initiate a test instrumented gas turbine into operation with sensors for measuring inlet pressure depressio...|$|R

Data hiding in encrypted images ensure {{that both the}} cover image and the secret message can be recovered at the receiver end. This work presents a novel data hiding and image encryption scheme using random diffusion and Two dimensional Arnold cat mapping transform. The secret message bits are placed in the least significant bit positions of the cover image. Then a shared key is used to generate random 8 bit random integer stream and {{is added to the}} stego image in the random diffusion step. Arnold cat mapping transformation is done to scramble the pixels. The two steps of random diffusion and Arnold transform mapping are done alternatively several times to completely encrypt the image contents. The process is reversed at the receiver end to get both the secret message and the cover image with little loss. The random diffusion step overcomes the limited period of the Arnold transform. The embedding capacity of one bit per pixel is achieved. Security analysis is carried out which shows that the encryption is highly secure. The number of collisions is low thus preventing brute force attacks. The original cover image is <b>recoverable</b> with minimal <b>losses...</b>|$|R

40|$|Although {{the pure}} {{economic}} loss rule has been remarkably durable in the common law, it suffers from a theoretical deficit. The rule has not been properly framed within the broader context of Anglo-American political economy. Any theory must recognize that the rule fundamentally deals with business risk and economic organization. Two conceptions of risk are important: risk to economic assets essential to the production function (loss of a factor of production), and risk to outcomes (loss of production). This Article proposes a production theory of the {{pure economic loss}} rule, which {{is rooted in the}} neoclassical economic understanding of the relationship between uncertainty and profit. The theory is simply stated: tort law protects one 2 ̆ 7 s factors of production, but not outcomes. The emphasis on the loss of an economic asset departs from the requirement of loss of one 2 ̆ 7 s property, the traditional basis for recovery of consequential economic loss. Ownership is not and should not be the touchstone of recovery. Rather, society has a normative preference for economic production, and tort law protects an asset essential to the production function, irrespective of ownership. The pure economic loss rule is a market abstention doctrine. It reflects a bright line judicial policy against corrective legal action when economic loss represents not a market failure in precaution but instead is a necessary condition of the engagement of enterprise under Knightian uncertainty. Thus, the production theory resolves a classic, longstanding riddle of the common law - that is, why consequential economic <b>loss</b> is <b>recoverable</b> upon the <b>loss</b> of an asset, but pure economic loss is not upon a poor economic outcome...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{factors and}} {{environmental}} awareness {{is driving the}} evolution of aircraft engines towards increasingly higher efficiencies, reaching for lower fuel consumption and lower emissions. The Counter-Rotating Open Rotor (CROR) is actively being researched around the world, promising a significantly increased propulsion efficiency relative to existing turbofans by employing two, counter-rotating propeller blade rows, thereby increasing the bypass ratio of the engine. Historically, these engines have been plagued by very high noise levels, mainly due to the impingement of the front rotor tip vortices on the rear rotor. In modern designs, the noise levels have been significantly decreased by clipping the rear, counter-rotating propeller. Unfortunately, this comes {{at a cost of}} decreased efficiency. An alternative, potential solution lies with the Boxprop, which was invented by Richard Avellán and Anders Lundbladh. The Boxprop consist of blade pairs joined at the tip, and are conceptually similar to box wings. It is hypothesized that the Boxprop can eliminate the tip vortex found in conventional blades, consequently increasing the efficiency of the blades, and reducing their acoustic signature. The present work highlights advances done in the research surrounding the Boxprop. A validation of the deployed CFD methodology is presented, in which numerical and experimental results compare favourably. Performance results for a Boxprop (GP-X- 701) designed for cruise conditions are presented and compared with a generic conventional propeller (GP-S- 609). It is shown that the present Boxprop cruise design can reach the required thrust for replacing the front rotor of a modern CROR, but with increased swirl relative to the analyzed conventional propeller. This is mainly due to the effect of the blade passage unloading one of the Boxprop blade halves near the tip, forcing the blade to be more highly loaded closer to the hub. The swirl generated by the Boxprop could be partially recovered if it is used together with a rear counter-rotating propeller. A Wake Analysis Method (WAM) is presented in this work and is used to quantify the power flows inherent to the flow features of the propeller wake. The power flows can be characterized as propulsively beneficial, <b>recoverable,</b> or pure <b>losses.</b> It has the ability to distinguish the kinetic energies of the tip vortices, wakes, and other disturbances from the flow field. The Wake Analysis Method was applied on the two propellers mentioned earlier, and confirmed that the Boxprop produces 50 % more swirl than the conventional propeller. Additionally, the method very clearly shows the lack of tip vortex on the Boxprop, and the presence of it in the flow field of the conventional propeller...|$|R
40|$|The first {{evidence}} of Roman delicts {{is in the}} XII Tables {{that in the middle}} of the 5 th century introduced the first types of delict and the first forms of obligation. From these provisions the Roman law givers did not develop a general law of delict governing the delictual liability. The Roman system of delicts was in fact typical: at first, the XII Tables introduced furtum and personal injuries — delicts that immediately after, in correspondence to the change of the Roman society, the praetor modified with the development of the notion of furtum and the change of the ancient poena for the furtum manifestum into a poenae obligatio and the introduction of the edictum de iniuriis aestimandis to determine the poena for injuries —, afterwards, the enactment of the most important law on damage, the lex Aquilia de damno, deriving from the iniuria – contumelia. Finally, in the 1 st century BC, during the violent fall of the Republic, a praetorian provision introduced the actio vi bonorum raptorum, dealing with robbery. Simultaneously, during the last republican period, the increase of the international trade and reasons of public policy let emerge the need to ensure the reparation of damage in some cases in which damage originated in the lack of supervision by the person responsible for such. The praetor introduced the actio de effusis vel deiectis, the actio damni et furti adversus nautas, caupones, stabularios that Justinian will include in the quasi-delict category. In the following centuries, the Roman jurists developed the classic configuration of the Roman delicts: the most important changes were introduced in the notion of iniuria and damnum iniuria datum. A new subjective criterion of liability — culpa — emerged from the interpretation of the iniuria in the chapters of the lex Aquilia, linked to the subjective notion of iniuria in the actio iniuriarum; a new evaluation criterion of reparation of the damage was introduced to recover the actual damage suffered by the plaintiff; a new notion of damage extended the scope of the chapters of the lex Aquilia by considering every <b>loss</b> <b>recoverable,</b> even if without physical destruction. The Roman system of delicts, however, was too typical to ensure the total reparation of the private damages deriving from an unlawful conduct. To this end, a new type of action, actio de dolo, was introduced to repair the loss caused by dolus, in case of absence of any specific delictual action. This new type of action is a subsidiary remedy which fills the gaps left open by the typical system of actions...|$|R
