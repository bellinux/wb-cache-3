5|$|Even {{after all}} Ostrom's work, several small blocks of lime-encased {{material}} remained unprepared in storage at the American Museum. These consisted mostly of isolated bones and bone fragments, including the original matrix, or surrounding rock {{in which the}} specimens were initially buried. An examination of these unprepared blocks by Gerald Grellet-Tinner and Peter Makovicky in 2000 revealed an interesting, overlooked feature. Several long, thin bones identified on the blocks as ossified tendons (structures that helped stiffen the tail of Deinonychus) turned out to actually represent gastralia (abdominal ribs). More significantly, {{a large number of}} previously unnoticed fossilized eggshells were discovered in the <b>rock</b> <b>matrix</b> that had surrounded the original Deinonychus specimen.|$|E

5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Heterodontosaurus tucki (SAM-PK-K337) was discovered during the British-South African expedition to South Africa and Basutoland (former name of Lesotho) in 1961-1962. Today, it {{is housed in}} the Iziko South African Museum. It was excavated on a mountain {{at an altitude of}} about , at a locality called Tyinindini, in the district of Transkei (sometimes referred to as Herschel) in the Cape Province of South Africa. The specimen consists of a crushed but nearly complete skull; associated postcranial remains mentioned in the original description could not be located in 2011. The animal was scientifically described and named in 1962 by palaeontologists Alfred Walter Crompton from South Africa and Alan J. Charig from the United Kingdom. The genus name refers to the different-shaped teeth, and the specific name honors George C. Tuck, a director of Austin Motor Company, who supported the expedition. The specimen was not fully prepared by the time of publication, so only the front parts of the skull and lower jaw were described, and the authors conceded that their description was preliminary, serving mainly to name the animal. It was considered an important discovery, as few early ornithischians were known at the time. The preparation of the specimen, i.e. the freeing of the bones from the <b>rock</b> <b>matrix,</b> was very time consuming, since they were covered in a thin, very hard, ferruginous layer containing haematite. This could only be removed by a diamond saw, which damaged the specimen.|$|E
40|$|This study {{develops}} {{a mathematical model}} {{for the analysis of}} pressure behavior in fractured lithophysal reservoirs. The lithophysal rock is described as a tri-continuum medium, consisting of fractures, <b>rock</b> <b>matrices,</b> and cavities. In the conceptual model, fractures have homogeneous properties throughout and interact with <b>rock</b> <b>matrices</b> and cavities that have different permeabilities and porosities. Global flow occurs through the fracture network only, while <b>rock</b> <b>matrices</b> and cavities contain the majority of fluid storage and provide fluid drainage to the fractures. Interporosity flows between the triple media are described using a pseudosteady-state concept and the system is characterized by interporosity transmissivity ratios and storativity ratio of each continuum. Pressure behavior is analyzed by examining the pressure drawdown curves, the derivative plots, and the effects of the characteristic parameters. Typical pressure responses from fractures, matrices, and cavities are represented by three semilog straight lines; the transitions by two troughs below the stabilization lines in the derivative plots. The analytical solution to the proposed model is further verified using a numerical simulation. The analytical model has also been applied to a published field-buildup well test and is able to match the pressure buildup data...|$|R
40|$|The {{multiple}} fracture network seepage {{model for}} fractured media is put forward. Faults, fractures and matrices {{are divided into}} 3 different groups according to their dimensions: (1) the trunk network composed of faults and fractures, which dominates the seepage field, (2) the branch network composed of comparatively smaller fractures, and (3) the equivalent network composed of the smallest fractures and <b>rock</b> <b>matrices,</b> which provides space to store fluid. The branch network connects the other two network systems. A joint element is presented to represent the trunk and branch networks and used to derive the continuity equation for these two network systems. An example is given to show {{the difference between the}} classic model and the new model...|$|R

The results of the numerical analysis {{have been used to}} investigate the effect of the matrix diffusion coefficient, fracture velocity, and matrix and fracture retardation factors on concentration profiles. It is found that in the presence of higher matrix diffusion coefficients, the behaviour of concentration profiles is different for constant and distance-dependent dispersion models. However, the behaviour of concentration profiles is observed to be nonlinear during the small transport time period, and the matrix diffusion is found to control the spreading of solute in the fracture in the presence of constant and distance-dependent dispersion models...|$|R
25|$|After {{the death}} and {{decomposition}} of a fish, otoliths may be preserved within the body of an organism or be dispersed before burial and fossilization. Dispersed otoliths {{are one of the}} many microfossils which can be found through a micropalaeontological analysis of a fine sediment. Their stratigraphic significance is minimal, but can still be used to characterize a level or interval. Fossil otoliths are rarely found in situ (on the remains of the animal), likely because they are not recognized separately from the surrounding <b>rock</b> <b>matrix.</b> In some cases, due to differences in colour, grain size, or a distinctive shape, they can be identified. These rare cases are of special significance, since the presence, composition, and morphology of the material can clarify the relationship of species and groups. In the case of primitive fish, various fossil material shows that endolymphatic infillings were similar in elemental composition to the <b>rock</b> <b>matrix</b> but were restricted to coarse grained material, which presumably is better for the detection of gravity, displacement, and sound. The presence of these extrinsic grains, in osteostracans, chondrichthyans, and acanthodians indicates a common inner ear physiology and presence of open endolymphatic ducts.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, fossil hunter Patrick McSherry, at {{the ranch}} of S.B. Smith in Johnson County, Wyoming, found {{the remains of a}} stegosaur. As he had {{difficulty}} securing the specimen due to the hard <b>rock</b> <b>matrix,</b> he sought help from Ronald G. Mjos and Jeff Parker of Western Paleontological Laboratories, Inc. They, in turn, cooperated with paleontologist Dee Hall of Brigham Young University. At first, it was assumed it represented an exemplar of Stegosaurus. However, Clifford Miles, while preparing the remains, recognised that they belonged to a species new to science.|$|E
25|$|When {{sedimentary}} rocks form, magnetic minerals within them tend to align {{themselves with the}} Earth's magnetic field. Through the precise measurement of this palaeomagnetism, {{it is possible to}} estimate the latitude (but not the longitude) where the <b>rock</b> <b>matrix</b> was formed. Palaeomagnetic measurements have indicated that some sediments of glacial origin in the Neoproterozoic rock record were deposited within 10 degrees of the equator, although the accuracy of this reconstruction is in question. This palaeomagnetic location of apparently glacial sediments (such as dropstones) has been taken to suggest that glaciers extended from land to sea level in tropical latitudes at the time the sediments were deposited. It is not clear whether this implies a global glaciation, or the existence of localized, possibly land-locked, glacial regimes. Others have even suggested that most data do not constrain any glacial deposits to within 25° of the equator.|$|E
40|$|Water {{flow through}} {{unsaturated}} rock has received increasing attention recently. In order to solve unsaturated flow problems, {{it is necessary}} to determine the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, K. A model which predicts K from water retention data was evaluated for <b>rock</b> <b>matrices.</b> It includes three unknown parameters to be determined from experimental data. To verify the model, K was measured by the outflow method. Water retention data were determined by two methods, the pressure plate extractor and the psychrometer. Near saturation, the water retention curve was best estimated by the pressure extractor method. The outflow method gave reliable measurements of K at low negative pressure heads (≥ - 1000 cm of water). The predicted K deviated from the experimental values when only the water retention data were used to estimate the model parameters. When the measured K was incorporated in the parameter estimation process, the deviation was reduced considerably...|$|R
40|$|We use an {{integrated}} approach consisting of experiments and complementary pore-scale network modeling {{to investigate the}} occurrence of sparsely connected pore spaces in <b>rock</b> <b>matrices</b> at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, and its implication to matrix diffusion. Imbibition results indicate that pore spaces in devitrified tuff are not well-connected, and that this lack of connectivity is further compounded by episodic flow in fractured devitrified tuff with low matrix permeability. A rigorous methodology for investigating chemical transport in fractured rock under episodic conditions, employing a suite of both sorbing and non-sorbing tracers (including radionuclides U- 235, Np- 237, and Pu- 242), has been developed and implemented. In addition, gas diffusion and synchrotron microtomography techniques have been under development to examine the scaling issues of diffusion and pore connectivity. Preliminary results from experiments and modeling work are presented in this paper, in order to reexamine our understanding of matrix diffusion and to evaluate the impact on diffusive radionuclide retardation of episodic fracture flow and low pore connectivity...|$|R
40|$|Karst {{aquifers}} {{are characterized}} by spatial heterogeneity due {{to the presence of}} highly permeable channels and conduits in low-permeable fractured <b>rocks</b> (<b>matrix</b> block). Recent studies have reported a close relationship between surface and subsurface water in karstic regions due to the water flow through a complicated network of paths formed by fracture intersections. Subsurface flow in karstified aquifers ranges between conduit flow, in large passages with relatively high flow velocities, and diffuse flow, in the matrix block where Darcy's law is still valid. In this paper, we present the simulation of a complex karstified aquifer system in Crete, Greece, where the presence of main faults drastically affects the regional flow. A discrete fracture approach in conjunction with an equivalent porous medium approach was adopted to simulate the mixed flow in the area of interest. The simulation results have shown that the length and the orientation of the dominant faults, primarily during the rainy season, affect the flow field. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.

Unlike conventional logging measurements (e.g., acoustic, density, neutron, and resistivity), which respond to both the <b>rock</b> <b>matrix</b> and fluid properties and are strongly dependent on mineralogy, NMR-logging measurements respond {{to the presence of}} hydrogen protons. Because these protons primarily occur in pore fluids, NMR effectively responds to the volume, composition, viscosity, and distribution of these fluids, for example oil, gas or water.

30|$|As {{described}} in the previous section, the foot of Mt. Chishinshan has an extremely low resistivity layer a few hundred meters thick near the surface, as shown by C 1 in Figure 6. This layer corresponds roughly to a region with a temperature of 100 °C to 200 °C, as shown in Figure 7 b, as obtained from temperature loggings (MRSO [1973]). According to the drilling report, the 100 °C to 200 °C region is rich in smectite, but smectite is not present below depths corresponding to temperatures greater than 220 °C (MRSO [1973]). In general, smectite is stable at temperatures less than 180 °C to 200 °C (e.g., Pytte and Reynolds [1989]; Anderson et al. [2000]; Komori et al. [2013 b]). This significantly decreases both the resistivity and permeability of <b>rock</b> <b>matrices</b> (e.g., Ogawa et al. [1998]; Revil and Cathles [1999]; Revil et al. [2002]; Komori et al. [2013 b]). Based on these earlier studies, layer C 1 appears to be rich in smectite and could behave as a low-permeability cap to prevent hydrothermal fluids from easily discharging.|$|R
40|$|A {{petrographic}} {{study of}} eleven samples of clastic rock {{returned from the}} moon by Apollo 15 suggests that two lithologies are present. The {{distinction between the two}} lithologies is based on the glass content of the <b>rock</b> <b>matrices</b> and the morphology of the detrital particles. Group I rocks have abundant, glass-rich, porous matrices and glass particles with morphologies comparable to those of glass particles in the lunar soil. The group I rocks were probably formed by welding or sintering of surficial soil deposits by impact-generated base surges of limited extent. Group II rocks have an essentially mineralic matrix and have an abundance of rounded mineral grains. Sample 15455 is the only Apollo 15 sample assigned to this group. In its general textural features, sample 15455 is comparable with the group II rocks from the Fra Mauro Formation at the Apollo 14 site. Textural features such as shock modification and rounding of mineral grains suggest that this sample {{is the product of a}} large-scale impact-generated base surge which possibly resulted from the Imbrian event...|$|R

40|$|Chloride and ³⁶C 1 from 1950 's weapons testing {{are good}} tracers of recent {{precipitation}} recharge in arid environments like the Nevada Test Site. Examining {{the distribution of}} chloride in soil, rock fractures and <b>rock</b> <b>matrices</b> is a simple method to clarify the dynamics of long time averaged hydrologic processes, such as occur in unsaturated zones. In general, where infiltration is rapid, chloride gets flushed into the soil or deeper into fractures. An estimate for infiltration rates can then be obtained by finding {{the peak of the}} ³⁶C 1 bomb pulse in the soil chloride. Some care should be exercised while using chlorides as tracers in layered or calcified soils. Results from a numerical model that is calibrated with soil ³⁶C 1 soil data also indicate that soil moisture and chloride do not necessarily follow the same path at large soil suctions. Nonetheless, the distribution of chlorine and its isotopes in unsaturated rock appears to be a useful tool to tracing historic water movement in a fracture system and perhaps qualitatively defining the matrix diffusion potential of the rock...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of meta-sedimentary bedrock as {{a source}} of stored water {{available}} to plants in a mediterranean climate is presented based on: root length distribution (RLD), root morphology, rock water holding capacity and seasonal pattern of water depletion. Studies were performed in southwestern Oregon under young stands of whiteleaf manzanita, ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir and Pacific madrone. RLD analysis shows that more then one quarter of the total root length of ericaceous plants is located in the rock layer. Stepwise procedures identified the best fitting multiple-regression model for relating RLD to depth, bulk density of rock and the space penetrable by roots (SPR). Linear expressions of SPR and depth were found to be significant explanatory variables. Roots of manzanita and madrone occupy rock fissures as small as 100 urn.

50|$|The {{dominant}} {{application of}} the electroseismic method is to measure the electrokinetic effect or streaming potential (item 2, above). Electrokinetic effects are initiated by sound waves (typically P-waves) passing through a porous rock inducing relative motion of the <b>rock</b> <b>matrix</b> and fluid. Motion of the ionic fluid through the capillaries in the rock occurs with cations (or less commonly, anions) preferentially adhering to the capillary walls, so that applied pressure and resulting fluid flow relative to the <b>rock</b> <b>matrix</b> produces an electric dipole. In a non-homogeneous formation, the seismic wave generates an oscillating flow of fluid and a corresponding oscillating electrical and EM field.

The excellent preservation of many fossils has allowed detailed anatomical studies, e. g. of the early teleost fish Cavenderichthys talbragarensis (Woodward, 1895). Here we report on the fluorescent characteristics and mineral composition of a range of Talbragar fossils. Most specimens fluoresce under ultraviolet, blue and green light. Elemental and mineralogical analyses revealed that the Talbragar fossils consist predominantly of quartz (SiO 2), a mineral that is likely to account for the observed fluorescence, with trace kaolinite (Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4) in some of the fish fossils. <b>Rock</b> <b>matrices</b> are predominantly composed of quartz and goethite (FeO(OH)).

30|$|The gradual {{increase}} in groundwater salinity {{is also not}} fully resolved at this time. However, poor recharge due to low rains and/or high ET leads to unlocking of deeper groundwaters that tend to be mineral richer leading to pumpage of deeper waters in contact with <b>rock</b> <b>matrices</b> (Tularam and Krishna 2009). Since local recharge highly depends on local rainfall; the decreasing rains have the potential of affecting groundwater quality (Taylor et al. 2012, Shemsanga et al. 2015). Decreasing rains/recharge is supported by local groundwater level trends (Shemsanga et al. 2015). Similarly, there are active HD—aquifer interactions; thus the gradual groundwater salinity increase could originate from HD salinity increases (Shemsanga et al. in preparation). This {{is supported by the}} fact that most wells close to HD had saltier waters while wells far away, and which acted as controls, had low salinity (Shemsanga et al. in preparation). It is worth mentioning that HD is a prominent discharge site for Makutupora aquifer, the main aquifers supplying water in DM. The possibility of these two water masses mingling requires careful understanding of these water components and further shows the need for holistically managing water resources, i.e., integrated water resources management (URT 2009).|$|R
40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{determination of the}} content of asbestos in <b>rock</b> <b>matrices</b> is a complex operation which is susceptible to important errors. The principal methodologies for the analysis are Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Phase Contrast Optical Microscopy (PCOM). Despite the PCOM resolution is inferior to that of SEM, PCOM analysis has several advantages, including more representativity of the analyzed sample, more effective recognition of chrysotile and a lower cost. The DIATI LAA internal methodology for the analysis in PCOM is based on a mild grinding of a rock sample, its subdivision in 5 - 6 grain size classes smaller than 2 mm and a subsequent microscopic analysis of a portion of each class. The PCOM is based on the optical properties of asbestos and of the liquids with note refractive index in which the particles in analysis are immersed. The error evaluation in the analysis of rock samples, contrary to the analysis of airborne filters, cannot be based on a statistical distribution. In fact for airborne filters a binomial distribution (Poisson), which theoretically defines the variation in the count of fibers resulting from the observation of analysis fields, chosen randomly on the filter, can be applied. The analysis in <b>rock</b> <b>matrices</b> instead cannot lean on any statistical distribution because the most important object of the analysis is the size of the of asbestiform fibers and bundles of fibers observed and the resulting relationship between the weights of the fibrous component compared to the one granular. The error evaluation generally provided by public and private institutions varies between 50 and 150 percent, but there are not, however, specific studies that discuss the origin of the error or that link it to the asbestos content. Our work aims to provide a reliable estimation of the error in relation to the applied methodologies and to the total content of asbestos, especially for the values close to the legal limits. The error assessments must be made through the repetition of the same analysis on the same sample to try to estimate the error on the representativeness of the sample and the error related to the sensitivity of the operator, in order to provide a sufficiently reliable uncertainty of the method. We used about 30 natural rock samples with different asbestos content, performing 3 analysis on each sample to obtain a trend sufficiently representative of the percentage. Furthermore we made on one chosen sample 10 repetition of the analysis to try to define more specifically the error of the methodology...|$|R
