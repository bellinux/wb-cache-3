40|$|The lateral {{line system}} on fish {{has been found}} to aid in {{schooling}} behavior, courtship communication, active and passive hydrodynamic imaging, and prey detection. The most widely used artificial prey stimulus has been the vibrating sphere, which some fish are able to detect even when the signal velocities to its lateral line are orders of magnitude smaller than background current velocities. It is not clear how the fish are able to extract this signal. This thesis uses a series of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations, matched with recent experiments, to quantify the effects of 3 D fish body parts on the <b>received</b> <b>dipole</b> signals, and to determine signal detection abilities of the lateral line system in background flow conditions. An approximation is developed for the dipole induced, oscillatory, boundary layer velocity profile over the surface of a fish. An analytic solution is developed for the case when the surface is a wall, and is accurate at points of maximal surface tangential velocity. Results indicate that the flow outside a thin viscous layer remains potential in nature, and that body parts, such as fins, do not significantly affect the <b>received</b> <b>dipole</b> signal in still water conditions. In addition, the canal lateral line system of the sculpin is shown to be over 100 times more sensitive than the superficial lateral line system to high frequency dipole stimuli. Analytical models were developed for the Mottled Sculpin canal and superficial neuromast motions, in response to hydrodynamic signals. When the background flow was laminar, the neuromast motions induced by the stimulus signal at threshold had a spectral peak larger than spectral peaks resulting from the background flow induced motions. (cont.) When the turbulence level increased, the resulting induced neuromast motions had dominant low frequency oscillations. For fish using the signal encoding mechanisms of phase-locking or spike rate increasing, signal masking should occur. by Mark Andrew Rapo. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|International audienceThe ROSETTA {{spacecraft}} {{arrived in}} the vicinity of the comet in early August. As part of the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC), the Mutual Impedance Probe (RPC-MIP) is designed to measure the bulk plasma properties in the comet environment. MIP is an active RF probe. It consists of two transmitters, which can operate separately as a monopole or coupled as a transmitting dipole, and a <b>receiving</b> <b>dipole.</b> The operating range of MIP is 7 kHz to 3. 5 MHz that allows covering the plasma density range expected during the mission from solar wind to deep coma densities. The baseline distance between the transmitter and the receiver is 40 - 60 cm, which allows probing plasmas with Debye lengths up to 20 - 25 cm. For longer Debye lengths, MIP uses one of the two Langmuir Probes of the RPC-LAP instrument located at about 4 m from the MIP <b>receiving</b> <b>dipole,</b> which allows probing plasma with Debye lengths up to about 2 m. The MIP <b>receiving</b> <b>dipole</b> (baseline 1 m) can also be used in a passive mode to measure the electrical activity in the comet environment in the same frequency range. In the active mode, MIP measures the coupling complex impedance between the transmitting monopole (or dipole) and the <b>receiving</b> <b>dipole.</b> To model the frequency response of MIP, a surface charge distribution method is used that takes into account the charge distribution induced on the spacecraft structures by the transmitter. The spacecraft surface is approximated by discrete elements smaller in size than the plasma Debye length. In our model, it is assumed that each spacecraft elementary surface carries a uniform charge distribution. The electric field measured by the receiver is the sum of the contributions from the transmitter itself and of all the elementary surfaces that represent the spacecraft. The frequency of the transmitted current is varied in frequency steps. Assuming a transmitted current I(f) of constant amplitude, the potential difference V(f) between the two receivers provides the mutual impedance Z(f) =V(f) /I(f) of the instrument as a function of frequency. The first observations in active mode, as well as the background electric wave activity {{in the vicinity of}} the comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko are presented. Preliminary inferred plasma parameters, such as bulk electron density and temperature, are derived by using the model for the MIP frequency response...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe mutual {{impedance}} probe {{is an active}} radio frequency probe, designed to measure in situ the bulk plasma properties. An ideal configuration consists of both a transmitting and a <b>receiving</b> <b>dipole,</b> whose baseline {{is at least a}} few Debye Lengths. Due to various accommodation constraints on the spacecraft, the transmitter may only be a monopole. In that case, the image of the transmitter charge is distributed over the whole spacecraft surface. The operating principle consists in injecting a frequency-variable current through the transmitter, in a frequency range that encompasses the plasma frequency (or upper hybrid frequency in a magnetised plasma), and measuring the induced voltage at the receiver. Assuming a transmitted current I(f) of constant amplitude that induces a potential difference V(f) at the receiver dipole, the {{mutual impedance}} probe provides the coupling complex impedance Z(f) = V(f) /I(f) between the transmitter and the receiver as a function of frequency. The impedance depends on the plasma properties, in particular the bulk density and temperature (in case of a Maxwellian distribution) of the electron population. The measurement principle is illustrated with in situ observations from the Mutual Impedance Probe (RPC-MIP), one of the five sensors of the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC) on the ESA Rosetta mission. RPC-MIP has been providing regular measurements of the comet plasma environment since early August 2014 when Rosetta was within 100 km from the nucleus of its target comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. RPC-MIP operates in the frequency range from 7 kHz to 3. 5 MHz that allows covering the plasma density range expected during the mission from solar wind to deep coma densities. RPC-MIP operates in two geometrical configurations. In the baseline configuration, the transmitter and receiver dipoles are aligned on a 1 m-beam. The transmitter-receiver distance, of the order of 50 cm, allows probing plasmas with Debye lengths up to 20 - 25 cm. For longer Debye lengths, MIP uses as the transmitter, one of the two Langmuir Probes of the RPC-LAP instrument located at about 4 m from the MIP <b>receiving</b> <b>dipole,</b> which allows probing plasma with Debye lengths up to about 2 m. Based on the same principle the Permittivity Probe (SESAME-PP), attached to the Rosetta Lander Philae, measures the electrical properties of the cometary surface material in the frequency range 20 Hz to 10 kHz.

40|$|International audienceThe Permittivity Probe (PP), a {{component}} of the SESAME instrument on board Rosetta's Lander Philae, was operated prior to the separation of Philae from Rosetta, during the descent and at the location of the final landing site. The working principle of PP consists in measuring, with a <b>receiving</b> <b>dipole,</b> the voltage induced in the medium by a current of known phase and amplitude injected by a transmitting antenna. The primary objective of PP is to analyse the electrical properties of the comet surface material down to a depth of about 2 m, and to record their variations with temperature, solar illumination and heliocentric distance. These observations are particularly sensitive to the concentration of water ice at the landing site. The second objective of the instrument is to monitor the spectrum of the electromagnetic and electrostatic waves generated by the interaction between the comet and the solar wind at frequencies of up to 20 kHz. The measurements performed during the descent were mainly devoted to the calibration of the instrument in its nominal configuration, with deployed landing gear and away from the Rosetta spacecraft influence, in an environment of known permittivity, either a vacuum or a plasma whose density and temperature would have been derived from the LAP and MIP data. This approach is unfortunately invalidated owing to the fact the PP receiver was most of the time saturated by the operation of the CONSERT radar during the descent, an interference which seemed to have been minimized during in-flight interference tests, but which was significantly stronger after separation of Philae from Rosetta. Nevertheless, it was possible to recover some information about the instrument's transmitter and receiver performances then used during the analysis of the data measured on the cometary surface...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTen {{years after}} the {{successful}} landing of the HUYGENS probe {{on the surface of}} Titan, we reassess the complex permittivity measurements of the surface materials performed by the PWA-HASI experiment (Permittivity, Waves and Altimetry - Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument). The complex permittivity is inferred from the mutual impedance of a classical quadrupolar probe, ie. the ratio of the voltage measured by a <b>receiving</b> <b>dipole</b> over the current emitted by another dipole. Using a simple model of the quadrupole configuration, the dielectric constant of the material at the landing site was first estimated to be of the order of 1. 8. A more realistic numerical model that took into account the influence of the HUYGENS gondola yielded a dielectric constant in the range 2 - 3 and a conductivity in the range 0. 4 - 0. 8 nS/m. due to uncertainties about the system geometry (Grard et al., 2006). However, a puzzling experimental fact remains to be explained, namely a sudden variation of the amplitude and phase of the received voltage 11 mn after landing that cannot be associated with any lander mechanical disturbance. Permittivity estimations were based on the first 11 mn sequence. The present analysis takes advantage of a recent analysis of the landing process that provided more realistic final position and attitude for the HUYGENS lander (Schroder et al., 2012). The new results lie within former estimated ranges and attention is paid to their sensitivity to geometry and to the reference measurements collected immediately before landing. This point is particularly critical for the estimation of the conductivity. The complete data set has been analysed, including the sequence collected after the first 11 mn. We consider various scenarios that may explain the observed phase and amplitude discontinuity. We tested two layers ground models in order to investigate the possibility that the upper layer may have experienced a fast physical change due to deliquescence or outgasing. Unfortunately a rigid quadrupolar array measure the average electric properties of the ground and cannot detect any inhomogeneity.

The receiving antenna on the neural interface is designed with different geometries and modeled at a range of implanted depths within the brain in order to estimate the maximum receiving power without violating SAR and tissue temperature elevation safety regulations. Based on the size of the designed antenna, sets of frequencies between 1 GHz to 4 GHz have been investigated. As expected the simulations demonstrate that longer <b>receiving</b> antennas (<b>dipole)</b> and lower working frequencies result in greater power availability prior to violating SAR regulations. For a 15 mm dipole antenna operating at 1. 24 GHz on the surface of the brain, 730 uW of power could be harvested at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) SAR violation limit. At approximately 5 cm inside the head, this same antenna would receive 190 uW of power prior to violating SAR regulations. Finally, the 3 -D bio-heat simulatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a recent effort to compare the sky noise power <b>received</b> by {{broadband}} <b>dipole</b> antennas at LWA frequencies as predicted by simulation and given by measurement are summarized. The simulation method, which combines results from a full-wave simulation of a given antenna design with a properly frequency-scaled all-sky map of radio continuum to generate predicted drift scans is first described. The measurement approach, which consists of conducting calibrated total power measurements of the antenna design {{over an extended period}} of time, is described. The measured and simulated drift scan results are then compared to determine the level of absolute agreement achieved between the two. Finally, conclusions are given. Drift Scan Simulation Approach The predicted variation in received sky noise with time is calculated in the usual manner by convolving simulated radiation patterns for an antenna with an all-sky map. In particular, the equivalent noise temperature due to sky noise for a lossless antenna at a given time, t (in LST), is given by the following expression [1] 1 TANT, lossless () t = ∑∑M(, i j) U (θφ,) cosb U (θφ,) cos...|$|R
40|$|The main crux of {{this thesis}} was {{to produce a}} model that was capable of {{simulating}} the theoretical performance of different configurations for a spatial measurement system using radio frequency technology. It has been important to study new modalities of spatial measurement since spatial measurement systems are an enabling technology that have allowed {{for the creation of}} better medical procedures and techniques, provided valuable data for motion capture in animation and biomechanics, and have improved the quality of manufacturing processes in many industries. However, there has been room for improvement in the functional design and accuracy of spatial measurement systems that will enhance current applications and further develop new applications in medicine, research and industry. In this thesis, a modelling framework for the investigation of spatial measurement based on radio frequency signals was developed. The simulation framework was designed for the purpose of investigating different position determination algorithms and sensor geomatries. A finite element model using the FEMLAB partial differential equation modelling tool was created for a time-domain model of electromagnetic wave propagation in order to simulate the radio frequency signals travelling from a transmitting source antenna to a set of receiving antenna sensors. Electronic line signals were obtained using a simple <b>receiving</b> infinitesimal <b>dipole</b> model and input into a time difference of arrival localization algorithm. The finite element model results were validated against a set of analytical solutions for the free space case. The accuracy of the localization algorithm was measured against a set of possible applications for a potential radio frequency spatial measurement system design. It was concluded that the simulation framework was successful should one significant deficiency be corrected in future research endeavours. A phase error was observed in the signals extracted at the receiving antenna locations. This phase error, which can be up to 40 °, was attributed to the zeroth order finite elements implemented in the finite element model. This phase error can be corrected in the future if higher order vector elements are introduced into future versions of FEMLAB or via the development of custom finite element analysis software but were not implemented in this thesis due to time constraints. Other improvements were also suggested for future work...|$|R
