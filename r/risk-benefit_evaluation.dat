40|$|Abstract Background Research ethics {{committees}} (RECs) are tasked {{to assess}} the risks {{and the benefits of}} a trial. Currently, two procedure-level approaches are predominant, the Net Risk Test and the Component Analysis. Discussion By looking at decision studies, we see that both procedure-level approaches conflate the various risk-benefit tasks, i. e., risk-benefit assessment, <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>evaluation,</b> risk treatment, and decision making. This conflation makes the RECs’ risk-benefit task confusing, if not impossible. We further realize that RECs are not meant to do all the risk-benefit tasks; instead, RECs are meant to evaluate risks and benefits, appraise risk treatment suggestions, and make the final decision. Conclusion As such, research ethics would benefit from looking beyond the procedure-level approaches and allowing disciplines like decision studies {{to be involved in the}} discourse on RECs’ risk-benefit task. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{tongue is}} an {{important}} oral structure that affects speech, position of teeth, periodontal tissues, nutrition, swallowing, nursing, and certain social activities. Ankyloglossia or tongue-tie, is a congenital anomaly characterized by an abnormally short lingual frenulum, which restricts mobility of the tongue. Though the ankyloglossia is not a serious condition, it {{may lead to a}} host of problems including infant feeding difficulties, speech disorders, and various mechanical and social issues related to the inability of the tongue to protrude. Hence, management of ankyloglossia should be considered at any age considering the <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Tongue being highly vascular and mobile structure, laser-assisted lingual frenectomy is the simplest, safest and less traumatic of all the treatment modalities available, with most promising results in minimally invasive dentistry.

40|$|Essentially all {{guidelines}} and regulations require that biomedical research studies have an acceptable risk-benefit profile. However, these documents offer little concrete guidance for implementing this requirement and determining {{when it is}} satisfied.

40|$|The {{currently}} {{reported data}} concerning the large WHI randomized controlled trial compare the impact of continuous combined conjugated estrogens + medroxyprogesterone acetate vs placebo in postmenopausal women. These results appear largely pessimistic. After 5. 2 years of hormone replacement, an excess of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, venous thromboembolism, breast cancer incidence and extension, mild cognitive impairment and dementia is recorded. By contrast, osteoporotic fracture risk and colorectal cancer are decreased during hormone replacement. Accordingly, this hormonal treatment {{can no longer be}} recommended on a long term basis, except after extensive <b>risk-benefit</b> balance <b>evaluation.</b> It should no longer be prescribed for prevention of chronic diseases. It remains indicated during 4 - 5 years for relief of vasomotor symptoms, genital atrophy and, potentially, for some aspects of quality of life. HRT should probably be prescribed in minimal-effective dosages; new regimens, routes of administration, new compounds and associations should be envisaged in order to avoid cardiovascular or breast problems.

40|$|We {{describe}} a 75 -year-old female patient with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who presented with acute ischemic stroke during treatment with dabigatran 2 × 110 mg per day. After informed consent, we reversed the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran using idarucizumab and applied an intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with recombinant {{tissue plasminogen activator}} (off-label use). An intracerebral hemorrhage was excluded after systemic thrombolysis. Despite the IVT, the patient’s clinical condition deteriorated and she developed an ischemic lesion in the right pons, the right thalamus and right cerebellum. To date, the literature lacks data concerning the thrombolytic treatment of acute ischemic stroke in patients after specific reversal of the non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant dabigatran using idarucizumab.

40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{insecticide}} synergist piperonyl butoxide-a-[2 -(2 -butoxyethoxy) ethoxy]- 4, 5 -methylenedioxy- 2 -propyltolu-ene-was {{tested for}} carcinoqeniclty in inbred F 344 rats in a 2 -year study employing doses of 10, 000 and 5, 000 ppm {{of the compound}} administered continuously in the feed. Although a statistically significant dose-related increase {{in the incidence of}} Iymphoreticular neoplasia was associated with administration of the compound to females, the incidence of that class of neo-plasm was higher in control males than in treated males. The finding of statistical significance in one sex is not considered by itself to constitute sufficient evidence of a biologic effect to justify an indictment of carcinogenic action. However, inasmuch as the chief use of this substance is to alter the in vivo metabolism of other chemicals, its possible role as a cocarcino-gen should be carefully considered in any <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> aimed at setting policies regarding its uses. -J Nat!

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the current EU {{regulatory framework for}} risk analysis of genetically modified (GM) crop cultivation and market introduction of derived food/feed. Furthermore the risk assessment strategies for GM crops and derived food/feed as designed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are described on which international agreement exists. Existing flaws in the EU regulatory framework for GMOs have been identified and proposals are put forward to improve current risk analysis procedures for GMOs by taking the SAFE FOODS Risk Analysis Framework into account. The SAFE FOODS framework describes an iterative decision-making process with four distinct stages i. e. framing, <b>risk–benefit</b> assessment, <b>evaluation,</b> and risk management which includes decision-making, and implementation, and a final review stage. Three major changes compared to current risk analyses practices are proposed, i. e. (i) {{the addition of a}} formal framing stage, during which problem formulation and the objectives of the risk analysis are established, (ii) enlargement of the scope of the risk assessment, by including the assessment of potential benefits, and an impact analysis of social and economic aspects, and (iii) addition of a formal evaluation stage, in order to weigh risks, costs and benefits and their distribution. Furthermore a broader participation of certain entities, organisations and individual citizens in specific segments of the risk analysis process, in particular in the framing and evaluation stage, is proposed. The proposed changes in current risk analyses practises may contribute to restore consumer confidence in risk analysis process of GMOs in the E...|$|R
40|$|Deregulation of antibacterials is a {{recurrent}} {{topic in the}} debate on pharmaceutical policy. This article focuses on one aspect of pharmaceutical regulation, namely the requirement of a medical prescription for purchasing antibacterials. However, a strategy of deregulation should not only concern the switch from prescription-only status to nonprescription status for a given drug, but should consider some complementary measures to minimise potentially harmful effects on health and costs. <b>Risk-benefit</b> and economic <b>evaluations,</b> which are possible approaches to assess the convenience of antibacterial deregulation, force the empirical evidence, the assumptions, {{as well as the}} value judgements on which the options are evaluated, to be made explicit. We outline the basic traits of an economic-evaluation approach to assess the issues related to the public interest and the feasibility of a deregulation policy. However, the answer cannot be a generic one, but should address the question for each particular country, and for each antibacterial and indication. Given the limitations of existing evidence on that issue, a tentative research agenda is also proposed.

40|$|SUMARY Melaleuca leucadendron L is a tree {{commonly}} known as cayeput, being an invasive, undesirable species in Cienaga de Zapata, {{in the province of}} Matanzas. According to the referred usages, it might be exploited in a reasonable way as an antimicrobial agent. As our objective we pretended to determine antimicrobial activity in the fluid extract of the leaves of this tree wildly growing in the before mentioned territory. The extract was obtained by repercolation and the assay was carried out in vitro, using the methods of diffusion in agar and dilution in a liquid media. Different concentrations of the extract were used against bacteria, yeast, and filamentous fungi. The microbicidal effect of the extract was demonstrated for all the tested microorganisms, establishing values of minimal inhibitory, minimal bactericidal and minimal fungicidal effects of the concentration. The effect kept steady during four years. These results confirm the purpose of using as antimicrobial the raw vegetable material existing in excess in the region. It is recommended {{to take into account the}} matters discussed in the study according to the undesirable effects, so other studies are required to deepen in that sense.

40|$|Abstract Microbial {{transformation}} of N, N-dimethyl-p-phenylene diamine (DMPDA), a microbial product formed from the fungicide fenaminosulf (p-dimethylaminobenzenediazo sodium sulfonate) was studied by enriching microbes in soils {{treated with the}} amine. Microorganisms isolated from DMPDA-treated soil belonged to the genera of Micrococcus, Alcaligenes, and Corynebacterium. Of the various isolates, Alcaligenes DM 4 showed maximal growth on DMPDA utilizing it as sources of carbon and nitrogen. When grown in mineral salts basal medium containing 0. 05 % DMPDA to serve as carbon and nitrogen sources, Alcaligenes DM 4 grew exponentially up to 18 h. Even though the characterization of the complete pathway of microbial degradation of DMPDA could not be carried out due to the auto-oxidation of the compound, the initial transformation product of DMPDA by Alcaligenes DM 4 {{has been identified as}} a dimer. The dimer is generated into the culture medium presumably by the extra-cellular oxidase of Alcaligenes DM 4.

The measured MeHg concentrations in fish did not exceed the Codex guideline level of 1 mg/kg. Swordfish (0. 28 ± 0. 23 mg/kg) and tuna (0. 14 ± 0. 13 mg/kg) had the highest MeHg concentrations. The MeHg concentration in the hair of infertile women (1. 82 ± 0. 14 mg/kg) was significantly {{greater than that of}} pregnant women (1. 24 ± 0. 18 mg/kg). In addition, 80 % of infertile women and 68 % of pregnant women had MeHg concentrations in hair that exceeded the USEPA reference dose (1 mg/kg).

40|$|Introduction: Antipsychotic {{polypharmacy}} (APP), {{the concomitant}} use of ≥ 2 antipsychotics, {{is common in}} clinical practice. Prior reviews {{have focused on the}} efficacy of APP, but no systematic review exists regarding the safety and tolerability of this practice. Areas covered: A systematic review of adverse effects associated with APP was conducted to prepare this review; case series with ≥ 2 patients, chart reviews, naturalistic, database, cohort and randomized studies that reported on the association between APP in general or specific APP combinations and global or specific adverse effect were included. Methodological limitations of available studies are discussed and recommendations for clinicians and future research are provided. Expert opinion: Across mostly small and uncontrolled studies, APP has been associated with increased global side effect burden, rates of Parkinsonian side effects, anticholinergic use, hyperprolactinemia, sexual dysfunction, hypersalivation, sedation/somnolence, cognitive impairment and diabetes. Effects on akathisia and mortality were inconclusive. Although some combinations, particularly aripiprazole augmentation of an agent with greater side effect burden, may reduce weight gain, dyslipidemia, hyperprolactinemia and sexual dysfunction, APP should remain a last-resort treatment option after monotherapy, switching and non-antipsychotic combinations have failed.

However, primary {{prevention of}} congenital anomalies is feasible because scientific evidence points to several risk factors (e. g., obesity, infectious and toxic agents) and protective factors (e. g., folic acid supplementation and glycemic control in diabetic women). Evidence-based community actions targeting fertile women can be envisaged, such as <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> protocols on therapies for chronic diseases, vaccination policies, regulations on workplace and environmental exposures as well as the empowerment of women in their lifestyle choices.

40|$|Purpose: Infective {{endocarditis}} (IE) {{in high-risk}} patients is a potentially severe complication which justifies the admin- istration of antibiotics before invasive dental treatment. This literature review presents the current guidelines for anti- biotic prophylaxis and discusses the controversial aspects {{related to the}} antibiotic administration for prevention of IE. Results: According to the guidelines of the American Heart Association, individuals {{who are at risk}} to develop IE follow- ing an invasive dental procedure still benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis. In contrast, the guidelines of the National In- stitute for Health and Clinical Excellence in England and Wales have recommended that prophylactic antibiotic treat- ment should no longer be performed in any at-risk patient. Bacteraemia following daily routines such as eating and toothbrushing may be a greater risk factor for the development of IE than the transient bacteraemia that follows an invasive dental procedure. However, a single administration of a penicillin derivate 30 to 60 minutes pre-operatively still represents the main prophylactic strategy to prevent bacteraemia. Conclusions: Presently, there is not enough evidence that supports and defines the administration of antibiotics to prevent IE. The authors suggest performing a <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> in light of the available guidelines before a deci- sion is made about administration...|$|E
40|$|Gene {{therapy with}} hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is an {{attractive}} therapeutic strategy for several forms of primary immunodeficiencies. Current approaches are based on ex vivo gene transfer of the therapeutic gene into autologous HSC by vector-mediated gene transfer. In the past decade, substantial progress has been achieved {{in the treatment of}} severe combined immundeficiencies (SCID) -X 1, adenosine deaminase (ADA) -deficient SCID, and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Results of the SCID gene therapy trials have shown long-term restoration of immune competence and clinical benefit in over 30 patients. The inclusion of reduced-dose conditioning in the ADA-SCID has allowed the engraftment of multipotent gene-corrected HSC at substantial level. In the CGD trial significant engraftment and transgene expression were observed, but the therapeutic effect was transient. The occurrence of adverse events related to insertional mutagenesis in the SCID-X 1 and CGD trial has highlighted the limitations of current retroviral vector technology. For future applications the <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> should include the type of vector employed, the disease background {{and the nature of the}} transgene.

Design/methodology/approach - Insights from extensive field research of a successful collaboration example in the Turkish dyeing and finishing industry. Findings - The competition among firms is increasingly shifting from company vs company to supply chain vs supply chain. The insights obtained from the collaborative model in this textile supply chain provide a good understanding of the benefits, bridges, and barriers associated with supply chain collaboration. Benefits can be grouped as customer-oriented benefits, productivity benefits, and innovation related benefits. Factors supporting collaboration are observed as trust, common goals for cooperation, and existence of cooperation mechanisms, while barriers are related to three factors: lack of trust, <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>evaluation,</b> and lack of common goals for cooperation. Research limitations/implications - Findings are based on interviews and questionnaires conducted with the managers of 3 T, 30 dyeing and finishing firms (ten are partners) and six technology-supplying partner firms, from various regions in Turkey. Practical implications - Highlights the importance of trust and collaboration mechanisms in managing collaborations. As the case of 3 T in the dyeing and finishing industry shows, collaborations might significantly contribute to the competitiveness of textile firms. Originality/value - This paper presents a successful collaboration model in creating new technologies and products by bringing the resources of competing partners together.

40|$|Anorexia nervosa (AN) is one {{of several}} neuropsychiatric {{disorders}} that are increasingly tackled experimentally using stereotactic neurosurgery (deep brain stimulation and ablative procedures). We analyze all 27 such cases published between 1990 and 2014. The majority of the patients benefitted significantly from neurosurgical treatments, in terms of both weight restoration and psychiatric morbidity. A remission of AN was reported in 61 % of patients treated with DBS and 100 % of patients treated with ablative surgery. Unfortunately, information on side effects is insufficient, and after DBS, severe side effects occurred in some cases. Altogether, the <b>risk–benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> is positive, particularly for ablative stereotactic procedures. However, fundamental ethical issues are raised. We discuss whether neurosurgery can be justified for treating psychiatric disorders of the will that are seemingly self-inflicted, such as addiction or AN, and where cultural factors contribute significantly to their development. We suggest that although psychosocial factors determine the onset of AN, this is not a legitimate argument for banning neurosurgical treatments, since in AN, a vicious circle develops that deeply affects the brain, undermines the will, and prevents ceasing the self-destructive behavior. Three confounding issues provide ethical challenges for research in neurosurgery for AN: first, a scarce information base regarding risks and benefits of the intervention; second, doubtful capabilities for autonomous decision making; and third, the minor age of many patients. We recommend protective measures to ensure that stereotactic neurosurgery research can proceed with respect for the patients' autonomy and orientation to the beneficence principle...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere is undisputed {{evidence}} that personalized medicine, that is, {{a more precise}} assessment of which medical intervention might best serve an individual patient {{on the basis of}} novel technology, such as molecular profiling, can {{have a significant impact on}} clinical outcomes. The field, however, is still new, and the demonstration of improved effectiveness compared with standard of care comes at a cost. How can we be sure that personalized medicine indeed provides a measurable clinical benefit, that we will be able to afford it, and that we can provide adequate access? The <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> that accompanies each medical decision requires not only good clinical data but also an assessment of cost and infrastructure needed to provide access to technology. Several examples from the last decade illustrate which types of personalized medicines and diagnostic tests are easily being taken up in clinical practice and which types are more difficult to introduce. And as regulators and payers in the United States and elsewhere are taking on personalized medicine, an interesting convergence can be observed: better, more complete information for both approval and coverage decisions could be gained from a coordination of regulatory and reimbursement questions. Health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) emerges as an approach that can satisfy both needs. Although HEOR represents a well-established approach to demonstrate the effectiveness of interventions in many areas of medical practice, few HEOR studies exist in the field of personalized medicine today. It is reasonable to expect that this will change over the next few years...|$|E

Since early {{detection}} can significantly improve patients’ survival rate, one of the physician’s primary obligations is to develop adequate screening plans to achieve early detection. ^ In clinical practice, physicians are required to make personalized screening recommendations with population-level guidelines. Therefore, physicians demand better information at an individual level, specifically, a better presentation of adenomas progression and <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> when individual patient’s risk-factor readings and pre-existing test results are considered. ^ I proposed a decision making support framework to help physicians with their decision making process, where analysis and interface displays would help provide a more transparent view of the model, measurements, and patient risk uncertainties to physicians. Specifically, an information presentation interface is developed on top of a mathematical model to better deliver and illustrate the result of cost and benefit analysis for physicians’ final decision making.

40|$|AbstractIn {{response}} to the sharp rise in the global burden caused by dengue virus (DENV) {{over the last few}} decades, the WHO has set out three specific key objectives in its disease control strategy: (i) to estimate the true burden of dengue by 2015; (ii) a reduction in dengue mortality by at least 50 % by 2020 (used as a baseline); and (iii) a reduction in dengue morbidity by at least 25 % by 2020. Although various elements will all play crucial parts in achieving this goal, from diagnosis and case management to integrated surveillance and outbreak response, sustainable vector control, vaccine implementation and finally operational and implementation research, it seems clear that new tools (e. g. a safe and effective vaccine and/or effective vector control) are key to success. The first dengue vaccine was licensed in December 2015, Dengvaxia® (CYD-TDV) developed by Sanofi Pasteur. The WHO has provided guidance on the use of CYD-TDV in endemic countries, for which {{there are a variety of}} considerations beyond the <b>risk–benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> done by regulatory authorities, including public health impact and cost-effectiveness.

Here, we report global levels for PCDDs, PCDFs, PCBs and the sum of o,p′-DDT, p,p′-DDT, o,p′-DDE, p,p′-DDE, o,p′-DDD and p,p′-DDD (ΣDDTs). A concise <b>risk–benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> related to human milk contamination with these persistent organic pollutants (POPs) was also done. Large global and regional differences were observed. Levels of PCDDs and PCDFs were highest in India and some European and African countries. PCB levels were highest in East and West Europe. The highest levels of ΣDDTs were found in less industrialized countries. A temporal downward trend for PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs is indicated. A risk–benefit assessment indicates that human milk levels of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs are still significantly above those considered toxicologically safe, while ΣDDTs are below or around those considered safe. With respect to potential adverse health effects, a more dominant role of in utero exposure versus lactational exposure is indicated. If potential adverse effects are balanced against positive health aspects for (breastfed) infants, the advantages of breastfeeding far outweigh the possible disadvantages. Our observations provide a strong argument to plea for further global source-directed measures to reduce human exposure further to dioxin-like compounds...|$|E

ObjectivesThe {{aim of this study}} was twofold: [1] to evaluate the prevalence of CRT DRI; [2] to analyze the predictive factors of CRT DRI. Methods and ResultsFrom January 2001 to May 2007, CRT implantation was obtained in 303 pts. The mean follow-up was 31 ± 19 months. Population characteristics were: mean age of 70 ± 10 years old; 56 female; aetiology [202 dilated and 101 ischemic cardiomyopathy]; NYHA class 3. 2 ±. 3; LVEF [26 ± 6 %]; QRS [171 ± 31] ms. Thirteen patients developed a DRI: endocarditis in 4, pocket erosion in 3, pocket abscess in 5 and septicaemia in 1. The prevalence of DRI was 4. 3 %. By univariate analysis, predictive factors of DRI were: procedure time [skin to skin: median of 85 vs. 57. 5 min; p=. 03], reintervention [54 % vs. 6. 5 %; p <. 0001], hematoma [31 % vs. 8. 6 % p=. 01], lead dislodgment [23 % vs. 6. 2 %; p=. 03], dialysis [23. 1 % vs. 1. 72 %; p=. 003] and procedure type [CRT ICD [8. 6 %] vs. CRT PM [1. 6 %] or up-grading procedure [1. 5 %]; p=. 03]. Four independent predictive factors of DRI were identified: procedure time [p=. 0002]; dialysis [p=. 001]; reintervention [p=. 006] and procedure type [CRT ICD vs. other procedures; p=. 01]. ConclusionsThis study found that the prevalence of CRT DRI is close to 4. 3 % at 2. 6 years [1. 7 % per year incidence]. Four independent predictive factors of infections were identified including reintervention, procedure time, dialysis, and primo CRT-ICD implantation. These parameters {{should be part of the}} <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> in patients selected for CRT's implantation...|$|E
30|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} an unprecedented explosion {{of scientific knowledge}} and advances in human microbiome research due to the emerging high-throughput molecular technologies. The term human microbiome refers to the population of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoan, and their genetic material that live on and inside the human organisms (skin, mucous membranes, intestinal tract, etc.) (Honey, 2008). A search of the literature at PubMed for the term “microbiome” in the title and abstract illustrates the fast progression of microbiome science. From 2006 to 2010 there were just 304 papers that used the word microbiome in their title and/or abstract, whereas the number has increased to 11, 128 from 2011 to 2017. Research on human microbiome, or our second genome, will inevitably bring about dramatic changes {{in our understanding of}} ourselves, normalcy, health and illness, and paradigm shift in the management of clinical practice and public health interventions, as well as the production and distribution of commercial products promising health benefits and disease prevention (e.g., individualized diet, probiotics, prebiotics and microbial-based interventions). For example, our commonly used diagnostic criteria for vaginal microbiota wherein the degree of “healthiness” is in part assessed by scoring the abundance of Lactobacillus morphotypes, but one study found a quarter of healthy women do not carry Lactobacillus in their vagina. This research calls for a better understanding of “normal” and “healthy” vaginal ecosystem that is based on its function, rather than simply on its composition (Ma et al., 2012). Another notable example is the increasing application of the new therapeutic modality of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which runs the risk of being perceived as a panacea for a multitude of illnesses and also the risk of abuse, as increasing websites sprung up advertising home DIY FMT kits as a “self-treatment” salvage (Ma et al., 2017). Extreme care must be taken for microbiome-based interventions to be specific in <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> and indications for application.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{integration}} of food data from research, monitoring, control, epidemiology {{and other sources}} is crucial to improve food safety and public health. Consequently, INSA launched the Portuguese Food Information Resource Programme (PortFIR) in a partnership with GS 1 Portugal CODIPOR to create national food expert networks and sustainable databases on food composition, consumption and chemical and microbiological contamination. Presently, the PortFIR data model is being developed. Existing data models on food information usually refer to either chemical substances or microorganisms. However, for food safety, particularly for <b>risk-benefit</b> <b>evaluation,</b> a unique data model to compile chemical and microbiological food information (CMFI) {{would be a huge}} step forward, regarding data standardization and optimization of resources. Purpose: The aim of this work is to explore the possibility of creating a unique data model for the compilation, management and use of CMFI compatible with EFSA’s chemical and microbiological calls for data and for nutrition applications, namely EuroFIR European Food Composition Data Bank. Method: The work was developed in two steps: 1) identification of existing relevant Data Models; 2) comparison and listing of all required attributes. Results: The data models identified as relevant were EFSA’s Standard Sample Description for Food and Feed, for chemical contaminants, Zoonoses Data Collection for microbiological contaminants and foodborne outbreaks and the CEN/TC 387 prEN_ 16104 Food Data – Data structure. The reasons to choose these references were the need to report data to EFSA and to update national data in the EuroFIR Food Composition Databank whose structure formed the basis of CEN/TC 387 work. All attributes in each model were listed and correspondence among models was cross-referenced. Conclusions: This work was the first stage {{in the development of a}} unique data model for CMFI. The biggest advantage of such a data model is the ability to store all the information needed in a single database whose compatibility allows to exchange and to share information with national and international partners, contributing to improve food safety at a global level...|$|E
