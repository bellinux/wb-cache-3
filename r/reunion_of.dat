Sea of Swords (2001) continues Drizzt's story after the events of The Spine of the World (1999), which focuses on Wulfgar, and Servant of the Shard (2000), which has Artemis Entreri and Jarlaxle as the main characters. Sea of Swords covers the companions' search for Wulfgar's lost magical warhammer, Aegis-fang, and the <b>reunion</b> <b>of</b> the group after an extended separation.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{successful}} camp, Baden-Powell went on an extensive speaking tour arranged by his publisher, Pearsons, {{to promote his}} forthcoming Scouting for Boys, which officially began the Scout movement.

Scouting began to spread throughout Great Britain and Ireland, then through {{the countries of the}} British Empire, and soon {{to the rest of the}} world. A <b>reunion</b> <b>of</b> the original campers was held in 1928 at the Chief Scout's home at Pax Hill in Hampshire.|$|E

5|$|Hermética {{remained}} a popular {{band in the}} Argentine heavy metal scene, even among the younger fans who {{had never seen the}} band live. Since their disbandment, the band's members have not attempted any reunion.

5|$|The Byzantine {{emperors}} {{appealed to}} the West for help, but the Pope would only consider sending aid {{in return for a}} <b>reunion</b> <b>of</b> the Eastern Orthodox Church with the See of Rome. Church unity was considered, and occasionally accomplished by imperial decree, but the Orthodox citizenry and clergy intensely resented the authority of Rome and the Latin Rite. Some Western troops arrived to bolster the Christian defence of Constantinople, but most Western rulers, distracted by their own affairs, did nothing as the Ottomans picked apart the remaining Byzantine territories.|$|E
5|$|The city of Arlington {{celebrated its}} centennial in 2003 with a parade, a festival honoring the city's history, {{sporting}} events, and musical and theatrical performances. The centennial celebrations {{culminated in the}} dedication of the $44 million Arlington High School campus, attended by an all-class <b>reunion</b> <b>of</b> the old school. In 2007, the city of Arlington renovated six blocks of downtown's Olympic Avenue at a cost of $4.4 million, widening sidewalks, improving street foliage, and adding new street lights. The project was credited with helping revitalize the city's downtown, turning Olympic Avenue into a gathering place for residents and a venue for festivals.|$|E

5|$|Urban responded favourably, perhaps {{hoping to}} heal the Great Schism of forty years earlier, and to reunite the Church under papal primacy by helping the Eastern churches in their time of need.

5|$|A {{few months}} later, the Emperor {{received}} word {{that his father}} had died on 10 March 1826, and that he had succeeded his father on the Portuguese throne as King Dom PedroIV. Aware that a <b>reunion</b> <b>of</b> Brazil and Portugal would be unacceptable to the people of both nations, he hastily abdicated the crown of Portugal on 2 May in favor of his eldest daughter, who became Queen Dona MariaII. His abdication was conditional: Portugal was required to accept the Constitution which he had drafted and MariaII was to marry his brother Miguel. Regardless of the abdication, PedroI continued to act as an absentee king of Portugal and interceded in its diplomatic matters, as well as in internal affairs, such as making appointments. He found it difficult, at the very least, to keep his position as Brazilian emperor separate from his obligations to protect his daughter's interests in Portugal.|$|E
5|$|For the sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, {{producer}} Kitase {{thought that}} the greatest fan expectation was for the <b>reunion</b> <b>of</b> Tidus and Yuna after their separation in the first game. The game generated rumors about Tidus' connection with the villain, Shuyin, who was physically similar and had the same actors. Square responded that such a storyline, given Tidus' nature, would be too complicated. For the remastering of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, producer Kitase's motivation was to have people {{too young to have}} played the games experience them; his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel.|$|E
5|$|Mutukumbo {{festival is}} the major festival celebrated in the {{province}} in Luapala Valley.

Kwanga festival is held in the October by the Njumba tribe in Samfya. It {{is seen as a}} cultural <b>reunion</b> <b>of</b> the tribe to preserve their rituals and traditions.

5|$|Shannon was {{discharged}} from the RAAF as a squadron leader on 15December 1945. He remained in England and became an executive with Shell and later Cunard. Shannon no longer flew after the war, but did like to drive fast cars. He also {{served as chairman of}} the No.617 Squadron Association, helping to raise funds for the Dambusters memorial at Woodhall Spa near RAF Scampton. His wife Ann died in 1990, and he married Eyke Taylor. On 8April 1993, shortly before a planned fiftieth anniversary <b>reunion</b> <b>of</b> surviving Dambusters, Dave Shannon died at his home in Sydenham, South London, aged seventy.

5|$|The {{band members}} {{subsequently}} focused on solo projects, and Ray and Dave released their own studio albums. Talk of a Kinks reunion circulated (including an aborted studio <b>reunion</b> <b>of</b> the original band members in 1999), but neither Ray nor Dave Davies showed {{much interest in}} playing together again. Meanwhile, former members John Gosling, John Dalton and Mick Avory had regrouped in 1994 and started performing on the oldies circuit along with guitar-player/singer Dave Clarke as the Kast Off Kinks. Gosling and Dalton retired in 2008 and were replaced in the band by former Kinks members Jim Rodford and Ian Gibbons. Ray Davies, Pete Quaife and Bob Henrit have occasionally made guest appearances with the group at Kinks fan club conventions.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} a remaster {{originated}} from a <b>reunion</b> <b>of</b> the games' original development team and voice cast during the making of Final Fantasy Type-0. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura, associate producer Hideki Imaizumi and a voice actor thought that they should create something to celebrate the tenth anniversary of X. Producer Yoshinori Kitase's personal motivation was to have people {{too young to have}} played the games experience them, as his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel. Another reason was that many did not have an opportunity to play the games since they were not compatible with the majority of PlayStation 3 models and neither available on the PlayStation Network unlike games from the original PlayStation like Final Fantasy VII and IX. Nomura entered negotiations with other old members of staff and got a remaster of X and X-2 approved, but the actual development process was delayed because much of the team was still busy with the creation of Final Fantasy XIII. The remaster was first announced at Tokyo Game Show 2011, where it was assumed that the game would release to commemorate Xs tenth anniversary.|$|E

5|$|During the Italian campaign, and afterwards, {{during the}} {{struggle}} of the Papal Curia with Frederick, Manuel tried to seduce the Popes with hints of a possible union between the Eastern and Western churches. Although in 1155 Pope Hadrian had expressed his eagerness to prompt the <b>reunion</b> <b>of</b> the churches, hopes for a lasting Papal-Byzantine alliance came up against insuperable problems. Pope Adrian IV and his successors demanded recognition of their religious authority over all Christians everywhere and sought superiority over the Byzantine Emperor; they were not at all willing to fall {{into a state of}} dependence from one emperor to the other. Manuel, on the other hand, wanted an official recognition of his secular authority over both East and West. Such conditions would not be accepted by either side. Even if a pro-western Emperor such as Manuel agreed, the Greek citizens of the empire would have rejected outright any union of this sort, as they did almost three hundred years later when the Orthodox and Catholic churches were briefly united under the Pope. In spite of his friendliness towards the Roman Church and his cordial relations with all the Popes, Manuel was never honoured with the title of Augustus by the Popes. And although he twice sent embassies to Pope Alexander III (in 1167 and 1169) offering to reunite the Greek and Latin churches, the Pope refused, under pretext of the troubles that would follow union.* J. W. Birkenmeier, The Development of the Komnenian Army, 114 Ultimately, a deal proved elusive, and the two churches have remained divided.|$|E
