40|$|We use {{combinations}} of feedforward networks trained to <b>recognize</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> face images to achieve excellent generalization.

40|$|Similar {{to adults}} with schizophrenia, youth {{at high risk}} for {{developing}} schizophrenia present difficulties <b>in</b> <b>recognizing</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> faces. These difficulties might index vulnerability for schizophrenia and {{play a role in the}} development of the illness. Facial emotion recognition (FER) impairments have been implicated in declining social functioning during the prodromal phase of illness and are thus a potential target for early intervention efforts. This study examined 9 - to 14 -year-old children: 34 children who presented a triad of well-replicated antecedents of schizophrenia (ASz), including motor and/or speech delays, clinically relevant internalizing and/or externalizing problems, and psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), and 34 typically developing (TD) children who presented none of these antecedents. An established FER task (ER 40) was used to assess correct recognition of happy, sad, angry, fearful, and neutral expressions, and facial emotion misperception responses were made for each emotion type. Relative to TD children, ASz children presented an overall impairment in FER. Further, ASz children misattributed neutral expressions to face displaying other emotions and also more often mislabeled a neutral expression as sad compared with healthy peers. The inability to accurately discriminate subtle differences <b>in</b> facial <b>emotion</b> and the misinterpretation of neutral expressions as sad may contribute to the initiation and/or persistence of PLEs.

50|$|A {{great deal}} of {{research}} conducted on emotion perception revolves around how people perceive <b>emotion</b> <b>in</b> others' facial expressions. Whether the <b>emotion</b> contained <b>in</b> someone's face is classified categorically or along dimensions of valence and arousal, the face provides reliable cues to one's subjective emotional state. As efficient as humans are <b>in</b> identifying and <b>recognizing</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>in</b> another's face, accuracy goes down considerably for most emotions, {{with the exception of}} happiness, when facial features are inverted (i.e., mouth placed above eyes and nose), suggesting that a primary means of facial perception includes the identification of spatial features that resemble a prototypical face, such that two eyes are placed above a nose which is above a mouth; any other formation of features does not immediately constitute a face and requires extra spatial manipulation to identify such features as resembling a face.|$|R

40|$|Affective {{computation}} allows {{machines to}} express and <b>recognize</b> <b>emotions,</b> a core component of computer games. A natural {{way to express}} emotion is language, through text and speech; computational methods that accurately <b>recognize</b> <b>emotion</b> <b>in</b> text and speech are therefore important. Machine learning techniques such as support vector machines (SVMs) have been used successfully for topic detection in documents and speech {{as well as for}} the identification of authors/speakers. SVMs have also been used for <b>emotion</b> detection <b>in</b> written and spoken communication, although with mixed success. An impediment to emotion extraction by use of support vector machines is that, after learning, it is not quite clear what has been learned. For instance, a gamer may acoustically respond to a character with fear and the SVMs that observe user behaviour confuse the sentiment (fear) with the character (e. g. an in-game persona). Successful emotion identification by support vector machines requires methods that ensure the recognition of sentiments without any confusion with certain topics or characters.

40|$|Background: The {{ability to}} <b>recognize</b> and {{interpret}} <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> others {{is a crucial}} prerequisite of adequate social behavior. Impairments <b>in</b> <b>emotion</b> processing have been reported from {{the early stages of}} Parkinson’s disease (PD). This study aims to characterize <b>emotion</b> recognition <b>in</b> advanced Parkinson’s disease (APD) candidates for deep-brain stimulation and to compare <b>emotion</b> recognition abilities <b>in</b> visual and auditory domains. Method: APD patients, defined as those with levodopa-induced motor complications (N = 42), and healthy controls (N = 43) matched by gender, age, and educational level, undertook the Comprehensive Affect Testing System (CATS), a battery that evaluates recognition of seven basic emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, and neutral) on facial expressions and four emotions on prosody (happiness, sadness, anger, and fear). APD patients were assessed during the “ON” state. Group performance was compared with independent-samples t tests. Results: Compared to controls, APD had significantly lower scores on the discrimination and naming of <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> prosody, and visual discrimination of neutral faces, but no significant differences in visual emotional tasks. Conclusion: The contrasting performance in emotional processing between visual and auditory stimuli suggests that APD candidates for surgery have either a selective difficulty <b>in</b> <b>recognizing</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> prosody or a general defect in prosody processing. Studies investigating early-stage PD, and the effect of subcortical lesions in prosody processing, favor the latter interpretation. Further research is needed to understand these deficits in emotional prosody recognition and their possible contribution to later behavioral or neuropsychiatric manifestations of PD...|$|R

Method: A bibliographical research of controlled studies with samples larger than 10 participants from 1990 to June 2008 was completed in Medline, Lilacs, PubMed and ISI. Thirty-two papers were evaluated. Results: Euthymic bipolar disorder presented impairment in recognizing disgust and fear. Manic BD showed difficult to recognize fearful and sad faces. Pediatric bipolar disorder patients and children at risk presented impairment in their capacity to <b>recognize</b> <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> adults and children faces. Bipolar disorder patients were more accurate <b>in</b> <b>recognizing</b> facial <b>emotions</b> than schizophrenic patients.
