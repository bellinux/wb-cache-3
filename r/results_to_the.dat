5|$|In a {{world where}} toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when humans are present, a group of toys, owned by six-year-old Andy Davis, are caught off-guard when Andy's {{birthday}} party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother, and infant sister Molly, are preparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, a pull-string cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody, organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Slinky Dog, into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge, spy on the party, and report the <b>results</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift – an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear, who thinks he is an actual space ranger.|$|E
5|$|Mayer was {{introduced}} to topology by his colleague Vietoris when attending his lectures in 1926 and 1927 at a local university in Vienna. He was told about the conjectured result {{and a way to}} its solution, and solved the question for the Betti numbers in 1929. He applied his <b>results</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> torus considered as the union of two cylinders. Vietoris later proved the full result for the homology groups in 1930 but did not express it as an exact sequence. The concept of an exact sequence only appeared in print in the 1952 book Foundations of Algebraic Topology by Samuel Eilenberg and Norman Steenrod where the results of Mayer and Vietoris were expressed in the modern form.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth {{is home to}} the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom (MBA) which conducts {{research}} in all areas of the marine sciences. The Plymouth Marine Laboratory is an offshoot of the MBA. Together with the National Marine Aquarium, the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Sciences, Plymouth University's Marine Institute and the Diving Diseases Research Centre, these marine-related organisations form the Plymouth Marine Sciences Partnership. The Plymouth Marine Laboratory, which focuses on global issues of climate change and sustainability. It monitors the effects of ocean acidity on corals and shellfish and reports the <b>results</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UK government. It also cultivates algae {{that could be used to}} make biofuels or in the treatment of waste water by using technology such as photo-bioreactors. It works alongside the Boots Group to investigate the use of algae in skin care protects, taking advantage of the chemicals they contain that adapt to protect themselves from the sun.|$|E

5|$|Some obstetricians {{argue that}} not {{offering}} screening for Down syndrome is unethical. As it is a medically reasonable procedure, per informed consent, people {{should at least}} be given information about it. It will then be the woman's choice, based on her personal beliefs, how much or how little screening she wishes. When results from testing become available, it is also considered unethical not to give the <b>results</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> person in question.|$|E
5|$|The {{color of}} the smoke {{indicates}} the <b>results</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people assembled in St Peter's Square. Dark smoke (fumata nera) indicates that the ballot {{did not result in}} an election, while white smoke (fumata bianca) announces that a new pope was chosen. Originally, in the event a pope was not elected, damp straw was added to the fire to create dark smoke. In the event a new pope was elected, the ballots were burned alone, creating white smoke.|$|E
5|$|The electors {{were then}} told {{to break up}} the Convention and {{assemble}} into the formal Assembly or Council. The electors voted by placing a pebble or written ballot into an appropriate jar. The baskets that held the votes were watched by specific officers, who then counted the ballots, and reported the <b>results</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> presiding magistrate. The majority of votes in any Curia, Tribe, or Century decided how that Curia, Tribe, or Century voted. Each Curia, Tribe, or Century received one vote, regardless of how many electors each Tribe or Century held. Once a majority of Curiae, Tribes, or Centuries voted in the same way on a given measure, the voting ended, and the matter was decided.|$|E
