50|$|One unique {{innovation}} of the K-series was {{the introduction}} of Variable Resonance Induction System (VRIS). Based on the Helmholtz <b>resonance</b> <b>principle,</b> the intake manifold is equipped with 3 chambers tuned to a specific resonant frequency. The computer dynamically switches between each resonant chamber to achieve the appropriate resonant frequency for the engine's rpm. This effect optimizes volumetric efficiency over a given rpm range to provide maximum torque over the entire rpm range. VRIS is used on the K8, KF, and KL but nearly all modern Mazda V6s are now using this technology.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of antenna designs {{are based on}} the <b>resonance</b> <b>principle.</b> This relies on the behaviour of moving electrons, which reflect off surfaces where the dielectric constant changes, in a fashion similar to the way light reflects when optical properties change. In these designs, the reflective surface is created by the end of a conductor, normally a thin metal wire or rod, which in the simplest case has a feed point at one end where it is connected to a transmission line. The conductor, or element, is aligned with the electrical field of the desired signal, normally meaning it is perpendicular to the line from the antenna to the source (or receiver {{in the case of a}} broadcast antenna).|$|E
50|$|This {{theory of}} {{operation}} is {{not supported by}} scientific theory; the devices have not been shown to work in blind testing, and the <b>resonance</b> <b>principle</b> invoked has not been shown to work in laboratories (and is not consistently employed by LRL manufacturers). In addition, the Inverse-Square Law limits the effective possible signal strength of any putative LRL; moreover, {{not only does this}} attenuation apply to the supposed emissions from the LRL devices, but the return signals from the sought-after targets are further attenuated by the same constraints. Since most of these LRL devices are powered by low voltage, low current AA, AAA or 9v cells, the resultant power available for emissions is quite minuscule at best, and the return signal would suffer even greater attenuation. Examples exist of LRL devices having no internal power source at all, and these are advertised as being self-powered or powered by ambient static electricity; these are indistinguishable from dowsing rods.|$|E

A comprehensive mathematical analysis is performed for both series and impedance matched circuits to show the frequency bifurcation effects in terms of input impedance, variations in transferred power levels and efficiencies.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the rapid inhibition of hypocotyl elongation by blue light was investigated in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seedlings by measuring the changes in turgor during the response. A special device, based on the <b>resonance</b> frequency <b>principle,</b> was built which permitted simultaneous and continuous measurements of both tissue rigidity (turgor) and growth rate on a single intact hypocotyl. The large decrease in growth rate following blue irradiation was consistently accompanied by a small increase in resonance frequency.

40|$|BACKGROUND: How {{does the}} cochlea analyse sound into its {{component}} frequencies? In the 1850 s Helmholtz thought it occurred by resonance, whereas {{a century later}} Békésy's work indicated a travelling wave. The latter answer seemed to settle the question, but with the discovery in 1978 that the cochlea emits sound, {{the mechanics of the}} cochlea was back on the drawing board. Recent studies have raised questions about whether the travelling wave, as currently understood, is adequate to explain observations. APPROACH: Applying basic <b>resonance</b> <b>principles,</b> this paper revisits the question. A graded bank of harmonic oscillators with cochlear-like frequencies and quality factors is simultaneously excited, and it is found that resonance gives rise to similar frequency responses, group delays, and travelling wave velocities as observed by experiment. The overall effect of the group delay gradient is to produce a decelerating wave of peak displacement moving from base to apex at characteristic travelling wave speeds. The extensive literature on chains of coupled oscillators is considered, and the occurrence of travelling waves, pseudowaves, phase plateaus, and forced resonance in such systems is noted. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: This alternative approach to cochlear mechanics shows that a travelling wave can simply arise as an apparently moving amplitude peak which passes along a bank of resonators without carrying energy. This highlights the possible role of the fast pressure wave and indicates how phase delays and group delays of a set of driven harmonic oscillators can generate an apparent travelling wave. It is possible to view the cochlea as a chain of globally forced coupled oscillators, and this model incorporates fundamental aspects of both the resonance and travelling wave theories...|$|R

The simulation data further verified that arc suppression coil grounding could directly decreases the grounding current when the single-phase grounding fault occurred. Moreover, it effectively eliminates the arc from the process and becomes the more reasonable grounding mode...|$|R
