According to some historians he was <b>really</b> <b>as</b> indifferent as he seemed {{and it was the}} ambition of his wife and of his allies that made him king. Some of them assert as well that the duke was hesitant because he, {{like the rest of the}} high nobility, benefited by Madrid's rule, but that the prospect of becoming king finally persuaded him. In any event, on 1 December 1640, the conspirators assailed the royal palace and the citadel of Lisbon, and meeting little resistance, acclaimed the duke as the new King of Portugal, John IV (João IV).|$|E

Despite having retained Thomas Erskine as his lawyer, who had successfully defended Hardy and Horne Tooke at the 1794 Treason Trials, and character references from George Fordyce, Aikin, and Hewlett, Johnson was fined £50 and sentenced to six months imprisonment at King's Bench Prison in February 1799.

500|$|Bell et al.′s {{objective}} was to test the explanations of how people become heterosexual or homosexual proposed by psychoanalysts and social scientists, to provide a firm scientific basis to thinking about sexual development and definitively refute mistaken theories. They wrote that the most notable proposed explanations of homosexuality were psychoanalytic theories attributing it to a failure to resolve Oedipal conflicts. In their view, theories {{about the origins of}} sexual orientation had usually not been rigorously tested prior to their study, partly because of the stigma associated with homosexuality and partly because some of the theories, including those advanced by psychoanalysts, use concepts which are hard to [...] "pin down and operationalize." [...] Bell et al. anticipated that psychologists and psychoanalysts would object to their work on methodological grounds, such as that no attempt was made to access unconscious material, or that the interviews, which lasted only a few hours as opposed to the hundreds of hours involved in an analysis, could never reveal what truly occurred in someone′s childhood. They argued, however, that the fact that their data was not obtained from clinical sources was a strength, that attempting to access unconscious material risks selective interpretation of the data, and that [...] "if the differences between homosexual and heterosexual patterns of development are <b>really</b> <b>as</b> great as psychoanalytic theory claims" [...] then such differences would be reflected to at least some extent in the reports of their respondents.|$|E

500|$|On the {{decision}} to downplay Raziel's quest for vengeance against Kain in this sequel, Hennig explained, [...] "he's being pretty simple-minded, he's sort of being very black-and-white in his interpretation of things, and being kind of petulant [...] he's not <b>really</b> <b>as</b> heroic as Kain is, {{and he has a}} lot of stuff to figure out, basically, about what's going on". Soul Reaver 2 was crafted to feature a more cinematic, story-focused experience than its predecessor, which the developers felt had been [...] "patchy" [...] in this regard. It entered production after Blood Omen 2, but shipped almost six months before the latter game. A separate team within Crystal Dynamics, with creative autonomy, developed Blood Omen 2, and contradictions created by its scenario hindered work on Soul Reaver 2. After researching time travel fiction, Hennig devised a subplot concerning temporal paradoxes to resolve the continuity problems between both titles, and established that Blood Omen 2s story is a product of the final paradox created when Kain saves Raziel at the end of Soul Reaver 2. Other themes were inspired by the works of Joseph Campbell, and theology surrounding Gnosticism. Concepts which formulated the crux of the story included the idea [...] "that the only way a hero can ever succeed is by following his own path", and the question, [...] "can you change history or not? And if so, what does it mean to change history - in terms of being responsible for the repercussions?" ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{release of}} The Little Mermaid in 1989, Disney was {{unprepared}} for the success that would be achieved by both the film's soundtrack and its songs, particularly that of [...] "Part of Your World", which became an instant hit. The studio had not thought to prepare a single version of the song at the time {{because they did not}} expect that it would soon be demanded by local radio stations, at which it was heavily rotated. The success of [...] "Part of Your World" [...] has been overshadowed by [...] "Under the Sea" [...] and [...] "Kiss the Girl", two other popular songs from the film. While both [...] "Under the Sea" [...] and [...] "Kiss the Girl" [...] were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 62nd Academy Awards, which [...] "Under the Sea" [...] ultimately won, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] did not receive a nomination, which some critics have viewed as a snub. Benson believes that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did not recognize [...] "Part of Your World" [...] because [...] "a story song at the time was probably not recognised <b>really</b> <b>as</b> much". However, when the film was released to VHS in 1998, Disney included a music video for [...] "Part of Your World" [...] starring Benson that appears towards the end of its closing credits. When The Little Mermaid was re-released to theaters in 1997, The Boston Phoenixs Jeffrey Gantz wrote that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] remains [...] "as poignant as ever". Tracy Dye of Bustle identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as her [...] "favorite Disney song of all time."
