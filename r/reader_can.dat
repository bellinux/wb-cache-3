5|$|In 2002, Chabon {{published}} Summerland, {{a fantasy}} novel written for younger readers that received mixed reviews but sold extremely well, {{and won the}} 2003 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award. Two years later, he published The Final Solution, a novella about an investigation led by an unknown old man, whom the <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> guess to be Sherlock Holmes, during {{the final years of}} World War II. His Dark Horse Comics project The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist, a quarterly anthology series that was published from 2004 to 2006, purported to cull stories from an involved, fictitious 60-year history of the Escapist character created by the protagonists of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay. It was awarded the 2005 Eisner Award for Best Anthology and a pair of Harvey Awards for Best Anthology and Best New Series.|$|E
5|$|Whereas the {{original}} version had included Sheikh Patrash Pasha showing Tintin a copy of Tintin in America, in the 1955 version this was changed to the earlier Tintin in the Congo, and Hergé would change it again for subsequent printings, this time to Destination Moon (1953), an Adventure set chronologically after Cigars. Benoît Peeters exclaimed that with this scene, the <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> imagine Tintin's surprise at encountering an adventure {{he had not yet}} had and which included the characters of Captain Haddock and Cuthbert Calculus whom he had not yet met. Another anachronism in this version appears when Snowy refers to Marlinspike Hall, the ancestral home of Captain Haddock, from the much later volumes of the series. Harry Thompson opined that the most important changes to the book were artistic, for in the late 1950s Hergé was {{at the peak of his}} artistic ability.|$|E

25|$|To be proved, a theorem must be expressible as a precise, formal statement.

25|$|From time to time, new {{vulnerabilities}} {{are discovered}} in various versions of Adobe Reader, prompting {{the company to}} issue security fixes. Other PDF readers are also susceptible. One aggravating factor is that a PDF <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file, providing a vector for attack. If a malicious web page contains an infected PDF file that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the PDF reader, the system may be compromised even if the browser is secure. Some of these vulnerabilities {{are a result of}} the PDF standard allowing PDF documents to be scripted with JavaScript. Disabling JavaScript execution in the PDF <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> help mitigate such future exploits, although it does not protect against exploits {{in other parts of the}} PDF viewing software. Security experts say that JavaScript is not essential for a PDF reader, and that the security benefit that comes from disabling JavaScript outweighs any compatibility issues caused. One way of avoiding PDF file exploits is to have a local or web service convert files to another format before viewing.|$|E
25|$|In computing, a hyperlink, {{or simply}} a link, is a {{reference}} to data that the <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> directly follow either by clicking, tapping, or hovering. A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document. Hypertext is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked from is called anchor text. A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a hypertext system, {{and to create a}} hyperlink is to hyperlink (or simply to link). A user following hyperlinks is said to navigate or browse the hypertext.|$|E
25|$|After {{determining}} {{that the subject}} is cooperative, the reader will make a number of probing statements or questions, typically using variations of the methods noted below. The subject will then reveal further information with their replies (whether verbal or non-verbal) and the cold <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> continue from there, pursuing promising lines of inquiry and quickly abandoning or avoiding unproductive ones. In general, while revelations seem {{to come from the}} reader, most of the facts and statements come from the subject, which are then refined and restated by the reader so as to reinforce the idea that the reader got something correct.|$|E

25|$|In {{the history}} of how systems of {{representation}} of language through graphic means have evolved in different human civilizations, more complete writing systems were preceded by proto-writing, systems of ideographic or early mnemonic symbols. True writing, in which the content of a linguistic utterance is encoded so that another <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> reconstruct, with a fair degree of accuracy, the exact utterance written down, is a later development. It is distinguished from proto-writing, which typically avoids encoding grammatical words and affixes, {{making it more difficult}} or impossible to reconstruct the exact meaning intended by the writer unless a great deal of context is already known in advance. One of the earliest forms of written expression is cuneiform.|$|E
25|$|The Sanskrit {{version of}} the Panchatantra text gives names to the animal characters, but these names are {{creative}} with double meanings. The names connote the character observable in nature but also map a human personality that a <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> readily identify. For example, the deer characters are presented {{as a metaphor for}} charming, innocent, peaceful and tranquil personality who is a target for those who seek a prey to exploit, while crocodiles are presented as a symbolism for those with dangerous intent hiding beneath welcoming ambiance (waters of a lotus flower-laden pond). Dozens of different types of wildlife found in India are thus named, and they constitute an array of symbolic characters in the Panchatantra. Thus, the names of the animals evoke layered meaning that resonates with the reader, and the same story can be read at different levels.|$|E
25|$|However, Alexander Grosart {{denies that}} Henry Vaughan was solely an imitator of Herbert. There are moments {{in when the}} <b>reader</b> <b>can</b> {{identify}} Vaughan's true self, rather than an imitation of Herbert. In such passages Vaughan is seen to demonstrate naturalness, immediacy and ability to relate the concrete through poetry. In some instances, Vaughan derives observations from Herbert's language that are distinctly his own. It is as if Vaughan takes proprietorship of some of Herbert's work, yet makes it completely unique to himself. Vaughan takes another step away from Herbert in his manner of presenting his poetry. Herbert in The Temple, which is most often the source of comparison between the two writers, lays down explicit instructions on its reading. This contrasts with the attitude of Vaughan, who saw the experience of reading as the best guide to his meanings and promoted no special reading method.|$|E
