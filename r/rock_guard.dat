50|$|The castle {{is a small}} spur castle on {{a narrow}} ridge with smooth sides. Its {{military}} effectiveness is due more to its remote and inaccessible location than impressive fortifications.

50|$|To {{navigate}} {{between the}} rocks of this gigantic cliff, {{embedded in the}} middle of Sergipe’s Alto Sertão, is an unforgettable experience. There are imposing valleys forming a 50 m-high canyon, surrounding a lake that, in certain points, reaches a depth of 190 m. Nests of herons and river islands complete the spectacle. The <b>rocks</b> <b>guard</b> traces of the area’s first inhabitants who lived there more than 8,000 years ago.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us rest here," [...] said St. John, as {{we reached}} the first stragglers of a {{battalion}} of <b>rocks,</b> <b>guarding</b> a sort of pass, beyond which the beck rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for gem--where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh for the frowning--where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a last refuge for silence.|$|R

The next day, Bobbo leads them to a deep pool. At the bottom, the desired swallow is trapped between two <b>rocks,</b> <b>guarded</b> by an enormous lobster. The five animals throw food into the water to satiate the crustacean's appetite, and Mariel and Dandin descend into the murky, forbidding depths to retrieve the swallow.|$|R

[...] The volunteers were then to march to the state rendezvous point and organize into units and be mustered into federal service. [...] Only two existing volunteer companies, the Little <b>Rock</b> <b>Guards</b> under Captain Albert Pike and the Crawford County Avengers under Captain John S. Roane, could answer the call. [...] Eight additional volunteer companies were raised through new enlistments.|$|R

The ruby rush was soon discovered to be a hoax as the rubies were garnets of little value. This ruby rock was moved from its original site in 1990.|$|R

These are known as <b>guard</b> <b>rocks.</b> If the <b>guard</b> <b>rocks</b> are removed, they are placed back in the positions they were before the shot was thrown, and the opponent's stone is removed from play and cannot be replayed. This rule is known as the four-rock rule or the free guard zone rule (for a while in Canada, a [...] "three-rock rule" [...] was in place, but that rule has been replaced by the four-rock rule).|$|R

50|$|Guardian Rock {{is a low}} {{ice-free}} rock {{lying in}} Bigourdan Fjord, 1.5 nmi km north of Parvenu Point, Pourquoi Pas Island, close off {{the west coast of}} the Antarctic Peninsula.

5000|$|Duart Castle on the Isle of Mull is the {{historic}} {{seat of the}} chiefs of the Clan Maclean. The castle is perched on a <b>rock</b> <b>guarding</b> the Sound of Mull. Dating from the thirteenth century it consists of a strong curtain wall {{as well as a}} substantial tower or keep that was added in about 1390. There are also later ranges that were built within the courtyard. Duart Castle was abandoned after the Jacobite rising of 1745 and it then became derelict and roofless. However, in 1911 it was acquired by Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 10th Baronet, chief of Clan Maclean who restored it. The castle is still owned by the Macleans of Duart although they now live in Perthshire. The castle {{is open to the public}} in the summer. The exterior of Duart Castle was used in the film [...] "Entrapment" [...] with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sean Connery, whose mother, Euphemia McBain [...] "Effie" [...] - [...] née McLean - [...] was a Maclean.|$|R
6000|$|The idea of Providence {{was very}} gaily travested by Daudet in [...] "Tartarin in the Alps." [...] You will {{remember}} how Tartarin's friend {{assured him that}} all Switzerland was one great Trust, intent upon attracting tourists and far too wise and kind to permit them to venture into real danger, that all the precipices were netted invisibly, and all the loose <b>rocks</b> <b>guarded</b> against falling, that avalanches were prearranged spectacles and the crevasses at their worst slippery ways down into kindly catchment bags. If the mountaineer tried to get into real danger he was turned back by specious excuses. Inspired by this persuasion Tartarin behaved with incredible daring. [...] . That is exactly the Providence theory of the whole world. There {{can be no doubt}} that it does enable many a timid soul to get through life with a certain recklessness. And provided there is no slip into a crevasse, the Providence theory works well. It would work altogether well if there were no crevasses.|$|R

60|$|Soon we were {{hemmed in}} with trees, which in places arched {{right over the}} roadway till we passed as through a tunnel. And again great {{frowning}} <b>rocks</b> <b>guarded</b> us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, {{we could hear the}} rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along. It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed. He kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.|$|R

According to the Israeli NGO Yesh Din, who had a field worker observing the incident, masked settlers had started the clashes by throwing stones.|$|R

The Rock can be painted several times in one night; however, it is a gentlemanly tradition among the fraternities not to paint over a sorority Rock for at least two to three days.|$|R
