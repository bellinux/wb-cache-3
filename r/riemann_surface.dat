The charts f and g are not compatible, so this endows C with two distinct <b>Riemann</b> <b>surface</b> structures. In fact, given a <b>Riemann</b> <b>surface</b> X and its atlas A, the conjugate atlas B = {f* : f∈A} is never compatible with A, and endows X with a distinct, incompatible Riemann structure.|$|E
