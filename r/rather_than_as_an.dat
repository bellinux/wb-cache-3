Volumetric MRI can detect changes in the size of brain regions. Measuring those regions that atrophy during the progress of Alzheimer's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator.

Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a long-lasting relish.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, in 1926, King Ferdinand allowed Filitti {{to resume}} his {{political}} career, making him {{a member of the}} Romanian Legislative Council. An emanation of the 1923 Constitution, it comprised experts tasked with reviewing laws endorsed by Parliament, and whose exact role sparked a series of controversies. Filitti was among those who described the Council as a necessary branch of the legislature, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> organ of the executive.|$|E
5|$|One point {{still at}} issue is the {{position}} of Ch'olan and Q'anjobalan–Chujean. Some scholars think these form a separate Western branch (as in the diagram below). Other linguists {{do not support the}} positing of an especially close relationship between Ch'olan and Q'anjobalan–Chujean; consequently they classify these as two distinct branches emanating directly from the proto-language. An alternative proposed classification groups the Huastecan branch as springing from the Ch'olan-Tzeltalan node, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> outlying branch springing directly from the proto-Mayan node.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} changes from the 1370s onwards was the {{adaptation}} of the town walls to mount gunpowder weapons. At this time cannon were still unreliable, only capable of reaching relatively short ranges and required the construction of specialist gunports. Cannons fired stone cannonballs, which did relatively little damage to stronger stone walls, and so were primarily used in defence of fortifications <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> offensive weapon by besiegers. The first gunports in Britain were installed in the 1360s on the Isle of Wight, but Southampton was not far behind. Around 1378 to 1379 the ongoing French threat led to gunports for handguns being built into the western Arcade wall, and by 1382 the town bought its own gun. God's House Tower was built to defend the southern quays around 1417 and the sluices that controlled {{the level of the}} town's moats, and equipped with numerous gunports rooftop firing points, and by 1439 Catchcold tower had also been constructed, again designed to accommodate gunpowder weapons.|$|E

5|$|This {{subfield}} {{of sociology}} studies, broadly, {{the dynamics of}} war, conflict resolution, peace movements, war refugees, conflict resolution and military institutions. As a subset of this subfield, military sociology aims towards the systematic study of the military as a social group <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> organization. It is a highly specialized sub-field which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with coerced collective action based on shared interests linked to survival in vocation and combat, with purposes and values that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns civilian-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies. Topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial-academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the institutional and organizational structure of military.|$|E
5|$|Due to his {{performances}} with Brescia, Pirlo {{was spotted}} by Inter coach Mircea Lucescu, {{who signed the}} playmaker. Pirlo was unable {{to break into the}} first squad permanently, however, and Inter finished eighth in the 1998–99 Serie A campaign. Inter loaned Pirlo to Reggina for the 1999–2000 season, alongside young Inter teammates Roberto Baronio and Mohamed Kallon. After an impressive season, he returned to Inter but was once again unable to break into the first team, making just four league appearances. He spent {{the second half of the}} 2000–01 season on loan at his former club, Brescia, where he played alongside his childhood idol, offensive playmaker Roberto Baggio. As Baggio occupied the attacking midfield role for Brescia, manager Carlo Mazzone made a ground-breaking decision, becoming the first coach to deploy Pirlo as a deep-lying playmaker, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> offensive midfielder, a deeper creative role in which he particularly excelled, due to his long passing ability. Despite initially struggling against relegation that season, Brescia would eventually manage a comfortable seventh-place finish in Serie A, also reaching the Coppa Italia quarter-finals, qualifying for the 2001 Intertoto Cup. A notable moment in Pirlo's Brescia career was his long pass which assisted Baggio's late equaliser against Juventus at the Stadio delle Alpi, on 1 April 2001.|$|E
