5|$|Under Lord Fairfax's ownership, the Cacapon <b>River</b> <b>Valley</b> was {{predominantly}} {{inhabited by}} English-speaking settlers {{as early as}} the late 1730s; most came from Pennsylvania and New Jersey. As settlement progressed {{during the second half of}} the 18th century, the fertile land of Hampshire County (including the Cacapon <b>River</b> <b>Valley)</b> also attracted German settlers from Pennsylvania and elsewhere in Virginia before and after the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783).|$|E

5|$|British General John Burgoyne moved {{south from}} the {{province}} of Quebec in June 1777 {{to gain control of}} the upper Hudson <b>River</b> <b>valley.</b> His campaign had become bogged down in difficulties following a victory at Fort Ticonderoga. Elements of the army had reached the upper Hudson as early as the end of July, but logistical and supply difficulties delayed the main army at Fort Edward. One attempt to alleviate these difficulties failed when nearly 1,000 men were killed or captured at the August 16 Battle of Bennington. Furthermore, news reached Burgoyne on August 28 that St. Leger's expedition down the Mohawk <b>River</b> <b>valley</b> had turned back after the failed Siege of Fort Stanwix.|$|E

50|$|Steep cliffs inside <b>river</b> <b>valleys</b> {{require a}} certain level of rock-climbing skills. However, because of the humid {{environment}} inside <b>river</b> <b>valleys,</b> some rock surfaces can be wet and some rocks may be loose despite appearing solid. To deal with wet climbing conditions, professional river-trekking boots are strongly advised.|$|R
40|$|Research {{concerning}} the global distribution of aeolian dust sources has principally focussed on salt/clay pan and desiccated lacustrine emission areas. In southern Africa such sources {{are identified as}} Etosha Pan in northern Namibia and Makgadikgadi Pans in northern Botswana. Dust emitting from ephemeral <b>river</b> <b>valleys,</b> however, has been largely overlooked. Rivers are known nutrient transport pathways and the flooding regimes of ephemeral <b>river</b> <b>valleys</b> frequently replenish stores of fine sediment which, on drying, can become susceptible to aeolian erosion. Such airborne sediment may be nutrient rich and thus be significant for the fertilisation of marine waters once deposited. This study investigates the dust source sediments from three ephemeral <b>river</b> <b>valleys</b> in Namibia {{in terms of their}} particle size distribution and their concentrations of bioavailable N, P and Fe. We compare the nutrient content of these sediments from the ephemeral <b>river</b> <b>valleys</b> to those collected from Etosha and Makgadikgadi Pans and consider their relative ocean fertilising potential. Our results show that the ephemeral <b>river</b> <b>valleys</b> contain fine grained sediment similar in physical character to Etosha and Makgadikgadi Pans yet they have up to 43 times greater concentrations of bioavailable iron and enriched N and P macronutrients that are each important for ocean fertilisation. The known dust-emitting <b>river</b> <b>valleys</b> of Namibia may therefore be contributing a greater fertilisation role in the adjacent marine system than previously considered, and not-yet investigated. Given this finding a re-assessment of the potential role of ephemeral <b>river</b> <b>valleys</b> in providing nutrient-rich sediment into the aeolian and marine systems in other dryland areas is necessary...|$|R

5|$|In 1641, Massachusetts {{expanded}} inland significantly, {{acquiring the}} Connecticut <b>River</b> <b>Valley</b> settlement of Springfield, which had recently disputed with, and defected {{from its original}} administrators, the Connecticut Colony.

In 1896, after the incumbent mayor had resigned, the town council selected Gallagher to briefly be the interim mayor until an election was held later that year. He served one more aldermanic term, but retired after defeat in the 1903 and 1907 elections. In 1911, he would also retire from his meat business. In retirement, Gallagher lived on a lavish estate on land he owned atop the Edmonton <b>River</b> <b>Valley</b> until his death in 1932.|$|E
5|$|James Caudy (1707 – March 15, 1784) was an American , settler, and {{landowner}} in the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians of the Colony of Virginia—present-day West Virginia. Caudy {{was born}} in the Netherlands, immigrated to the Thirteen Colonies in the 1730s, and settled within the Cacapon <b>River</b> <b>valley</b> near present-day Capon Bridge in Hampshire County. As early as 1741, Caudy was associated with the arrangement and development of transportation routes throughout present-day Hampshire County. Caudy twice hosted George Washington; first during his surveying expedition in 1748 and again upon Washington's 1750 return to the Cacapon <b>River</b> <b>valley.</b>|$|E
5|$|Largely {{bypassed}} by {{the early}} non-native explorers, fur traders, and settlers because of its remote location, the region attracted newcomers in quantity when prospectors found gold near Jacksonville in the Rogue <b>River</b> <b>valley</b> in 1851. This {{led to the creation}} of Jackson County in 1852 and, after gold discoveries near Waldo in the Illinois <b>River</b> <b>valley,</b> the creation of Josephine County, named for the daughter of a gold miner. Even with an influx of miners and of settlers who farmed donation land claims, Josephine County's population was only 1,204 in 1870.|$|E
