50|$|Rivet guns vary in {{size and}} shape and {{have a variety of}} handles and grips. Pneumatic rivet guns {{typically}} have a regulator which adjusts the amount of air entering the tool. Regulated air entering passes through the throttle valve which is typically controlled by a trigger in the hand grip. When the trigger is squeezed, the throttle valve opens, allowing the pressurized air to flow into the piston. As the piston moves, a port opens allowing the air pressure to escape. The piston strikes against the <b>rivet</b> <b>set.</b> The force on the <b>rivet</b> <b>set</b> pushes the rivet into the work and against the buck. The buck deforms the tail of the rivet. The piston is returned to the original position by a spring or the shifting of a valve allowing air to drive the piston back to the starting position.|$|E
5000|$|At {{a central}} {{location}} near the areas being riveted, a furnace was set up. Rivets {{were placed in}} the furnace and heated to glowing hot (often to white hot) so that they were more plastic and easily deformed. The rivet warmer or [...] "cook" [...] used tongs to remove individual rivets and throw them to a catcher stationed near the joints to be riveted. The catcher (usually) caught the rivet in a leather or wooden bucket with an ash-lined bottom. He placed the rivet into the hole to be riveted, then quickly turned to catch the next rivet. The [...] "holder up or holder on" [...] would hold a heavy <b>rivet</b> <b>set</b> or dolly or another (larger) pneumatic jack against the round head of the rivet, while the riveter (sometimes two riveters) applied a hammer or pneumatic rivet hammer to the unformed head, making it mushroom tightly against the joint in its final domed shape. Alternatively the buck is hammered more or less flush with the structure in a counter sunk hole. Before the use of pneumatic hammers, e.g. in the construction of RMS Titanic, the man who hammered the rivet was known as the [...] "basher". Upon cooling, the rivet contracted and exerted further force, tightening the joint.|$|E

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to extend our previous single robot path planning algorithm into the multiple robots version.

A {{frictional}} contact model is adopted {{for the analysis}} of conventional solid <b>rivet</b> <b>setting.</b> Material properties for the selected plates and rivets are obtained from analytical method using elastic constants and tensile strengths for each material. Rigid- and elasto-plastic models are selected for process analysis in this paper. Process variables are selected to investigate the effect of variables on the successful <b>rivet</b> <b>setting</b> and servicing in any structure as force transmitting member. Major variables in riveting process are material variables such as material properties and geometrical variables, which are dimensions of head, shank, and blank diameters. Analysis in this study is concentrated on the influence of variety of materials and of shank dimensions on the contact area after <b>rivet</b> <b>setting,</b> i. e. after forming process of rivet head. Soft and hard materials are selected as mother materials to investigate how the selection of material influences on the riveting process in quantitative manner. The geometry of head is closely investigated through simulation in terms of contact status, i. e. contact area between rivet head and mother material, which would affect the snap fit joint by riveting...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} formal {{definition}} of design problem using the axiomatic theory of design modeling. Based {{on the concept}} of product system and an informal description of design problem, a design problem is formulated into three parts: environment, structural requirements, as well as performance requirements. On the basis of this formulation, both structural requirements and performance requirements are related to product environment, which is divided into natural, built, and human environments. As a result, product environment is identified as the source of product requirements. An environment-based formulation of design problem is thus developed. This formulation implies that both design problem and design solutions are included in a product system. The design governing equation is formulated to capture the interdependence relation between product problem and product descriptions along the design process. An example of <b>rivet</b> <b>setting</b> tool design is used to illustrate the mathematical formulations throughout the paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{stress wave}} riveter deforms the rivet {{material}} {{by a high}} amplitude stress wave. Thus, the entire <b>rivet</b> is <b>set</b> in motion radially. The rivet expands rapidly and impacts the hole surface before the rivet tail begins to form. Unlike the oversqueezed <b>rivets,</b> therefore, it <b>sets</b> up uniform interference without distortion in the skins. Furthermore, the radial velocity is so high (over 200 in. /sec) that upon impact with the hole surface it deforms the surface plastically. This is especially effective in aluminum skins. Thus the SWR combines the advantages of plastically deforming the hole and the economic advantage of a relatively nonprecision hole and inexpensive rivets like those used in oversqueezing. The additional advantage SWR offers {{is that it is}} a portable tool...|$|R

Research has shown that friction is a very important factor that influences both the riveting process and the joint strength for SPR, but these influences have not been fully understood. In this paper, AA 5754 sheets with different surface textures, such as original with solid wax, hot water washed, sandpaper ground and grit blasted, were used to study the influence of friction on therivet inserting process, joint features and static lap shear strength. The results of joint features and <b>rivet</b> <b>setting</b> displacement-force curve showed that hot water wash and sandpaper grinding on aluminium sheet did not have significant influence on the rivet inserting process and joint features; however, for joints with grit-blasted substrates, the rivet -setting forces were higher at the beginning, and a middle section of the curve and the joint features, such as interlocks and minimum remaining bottom material thickness (Tmin), were clearly altered. The lap shear tests showed that hot water washing can slightly increase the lap shear strength, sandpaper grinding increased the static lap shear strength further and grit blasting increased the static lap shear strength the most...|$|R

SPR is becoming important in automotive applications for aluminium vehicle body assembly. However, compared with current sheet-metal joining {{processes in the}} automotive industry, the effects of various parameters such as mechanical properties, <b>rivet</b> <b>setting</b> methods and systems, methods of removing self-piercing rivets, etc. A study examining the effect of specimen configuration on the mechanical behavior of self-piercing riveted, dual-layer joints in aluminium alloys was conducted.

The basic aspects of SPR process forming by conducting both explicit and implicit analysis have been investigated in this thesis. It was found that the operating force-deformation curve of SPR process was determined by the rivet deformation force and its displacement. Under certain process conditions, an increase in inertia effect due to high velocity of metal forming process results was not significant to an extent. In this research, the springback characteristic parameters of the SPR process were also studied.

40|$|Regarding {{the use of}} material, modern {{lightweight}} car {{bodies are}} becoming more and more complex than previous constructions. The materials nowadays are used for a more specific field of application and more high strength steels are used and also other materials like aluminium, stainless steel, reinforced polymers are used more frequent. The joining of these materials often requires new or modified joining processes. The aim with this thesis is concerned with the development of simulation models of the joining process as well as mechanical properties of self piercing riveted (SPR) joints and pierce nut joints. In both of these joining methods problems occur when introducing more high strength steel sheets. For SPR, fractures occur in the rivet, and for pierce nut the thread will be damaged. Since both the SPR process and the pierce nut process expose the material for plastic deformation up to 150 %, correct material properties for very large strain and a simulation program that could handle this was required. With the commercial finite element program Deform 2 D an axi-symmetric model has been built for the SPR process and the pierce nut process. Because of the computational time, 3 D simulations were only used where it was necessary. The developed 3 D models use the commercial finite element program ABAQUS-Explicit. All simulation models have been verified with satisfactory agreement to experimental results. For SPR, an axi-symmetric simulation model was used for evaluating and optimising the setting process in the stainless steel sheets EN 1. 4301, HyTens 800 and HyTens 1200. Subsequently, 3 D models were used for predicting the mechanical properties of new SPR joints that have showed reduced risk for rivet cracking. In pierce nut simulations, nuts with hardness 8 and 10 have been set in the high strength steel sheet DP 600. An axi-symmetric simulation model was used for centred nut setting and two different simulation models in 3 D were used to evaluate eccentric nut setting and torque resistance. This work resulted in more knowledge about the fracture risk in the rivet and how to reduce it. The strain and stress, which was used as fracture indicators, were reduced to the half with modifications of the rivet and the die geometry. Mechanical property simulations in shear and peel load resulted in satisfactory results for new SPR joints that have showed reduced fracture risk during <b>rivet</b> <b>setting.</b> New die and rivet designs can be developed effectively by combining the process and mechanical property simulations. For a pierce nut joint in high strength steel sheets (1. 5 mm DP 600), the simulations show that the cutting of the sheet in combination with eccentric setting over the die causes the thread damage. The thread damage can be avoided by changing the dimension of the nut or by increasing the strength of the nut material. The simulation models can also be used to develop new nut and die geometries for future applications. QC 2010111...|$|R

40|$|To {{manufacture}} multi-material hybrid {{parts for}} the automotive industry, mechanical joiningprocesses like riveting are well established. However, adhesive bonding is increasingly beingused {{in the car}} body. The combination of the specific advantages of both joining techniques inform of hybrid joints yields in synergies of manufacturing, crash and durability performance. Critical issues are the formation of adhesive bags {{in the region of}} the mechanical junctionsand global deformations of the metal blanks between the mechanical joints. Bags in the regionof the mechanical junctions decrease the strength of the mechanical joints [1]. Globaldeformations caused by the formation of adhesives bags while the multi-point mechanicalfixation process takes place, influence the smoothness of the bonded part’s surface [2]. Thisproject focuses the numerical simulation of the time dependent formation process of bothtypes of bags.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the existing flush rivet inspection criteria and inspection methods to establish a norm for commercial flush riveted joints. Studies were made of thirty-four flush riveted joint load deformation curves to obtain their general characteristics and to establish some correlation of yield load as defined in ANC- 5 and as defined in Report on Flush Riveted Joint Strength by ARC Rivet and Screw Allowables Subcommittee (Airworthiness Project 12). The specimens corresponding to the load deformation curves were comprised of 18 machine countersunk joints, 12 double dimple joints and four sub-countersunk joints. Within each type of joints the specimen varied in series of sheet material and thickness, rivet material and rivet size. It is shown that yield load, defined as load giving four percent of <b>rivet</b> diameter joint <b>set,</b> is dependent on d/t ratios, the yield load lowering at increasing d/t values. Also, there are indications that as softer rivet material is used with a given sheet material, the increasing d/t ratios have less adverse effects. There could be made no particular correlation of yield load as defined by load at. 005 " set with any of the varying parameters. In the case of the double dimple and sub-countersunk joints, no particular conclusions could be reached as the test data was confined to a small range of d/t values.

S. history. Racial, gender, ethnic and religious violence persist. This <b>riveting</b> new <b>set</b> focused on hate crimes {{comes at a time when}} such acts are still not uncommon. The topic, then, remains relevant despite outcries for an end to such violence. It covers a wide variety of hate crimes, the consequences for both victims and perpetrators and their communities, efforts to combat hate crime, and other aspects of these ugly offenses that affect everyone. Rather than an "individual" crime, hate crime is, in fact, an assault against all members of stigmatized and marginalized communities. With respect to hate crime, at least, history does repeat itself as similar patterns of motivation, sentiment and victimization recur over time. Just as immigrants in the 1890 s were subject to institutional and public forms of discrimination and violence, so too were those of the 1990 s; likewise, former black slaves risked the wrath of the KKK when they exercised their newfound rights after the Civil War, just as their descendants risked violent reprisal for their efforts to win and exercise additional rights and freedoms in the civil rights era. While the politics of difference that underlie these periods of animosity may lie latent for short periods of time, they nonetheless seem to remain on the simmer, ready to resurface whenever a new threat is perceived - when immigration levels increase, or when relationships between groups shift for other political, economic, or cultural reasons, or in the aftermath of attacks like those on 9 / 11. Yet, understanding the scope of hate crimes is impossible without examining the victims, the offenders, the consequences and harms of hate crimes, and the actual definitions of just what hate crime is. This comprehensive five-volume set addresses these areas in careful analyses that take into account the variety and incidence of hate crimes and the impact they have on the broader realm of crime, punishment, communities, society, and the security of a pluralistic society that seeks to remain peaceful even in the face of change.
