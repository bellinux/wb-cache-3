40|$|Motor {{transport}} and road maintenance are the determining factors of environmental {{pollution in the}} <b>roadside</b> <b>zone.</b> The main acceptor of pollution {{in this case is}} the soil. In connection with the complexity of the application of instrumental control methods, it is perspective to carry out the monitoring of roadside territories on the basis of mathematical modeling. The objective of the study is to develop a model of vehicle emissions impact on roadside soils with washout from the road bed. As a physical model we will consider roadside underlying surface covered with a layer of raindrops. According to the physical model, pollutants are absorbed by rain drops when falling on the underlying surface. Movement of pollutants down the whole depth of soil profile is carried out under the action of filtering the contaminated liquid in the granular material of soil. Analytical dependencies have been obtained allowing to predict the roadside ecosystem pollution from exhaust emissions. Soil contamination with liquid effluents resulting from the dissolution of sulfur dioxide in atmospheric precipitation has been calculated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyses}} {{the clear}} zone design parameters, including driver reaction time, conditions of vehicle leaving roadway and driving distance in clear zone. Meanwhile, in classical physics, {{the process that}} the vehicle runs off roadway {{can be seen as}} a combination of uniform motion in a straight line and rectilinear motion of uniform deceleration. Then, based on the forgiving design concept, the paper sets up a calculation model for the <b>roadside</b> clear <b>zone.</b> It calculates width range of <b>roadside</b> clear <b>zone.</b> According to the calculated results and the actual instance of roadside, it brings forward the recommended width of <b>roadside</b> clear <b>zone.</b> Compared with RISER (Roadside Infrastructure for Safer European Roads), the paper considers driver reaction time, so the calculation of clear zone width is larger and safer. However, the computed results are reasonable and acceptable because they are essentially consistent with the suggested clear zone distance in AASHTO's Roadside Design Guide (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials). Therefore, the research results of the paper could be a supplementary guidance or reference for road designer and administrator...|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} the {{importance}} of <b>roadside</b> clear <b>zones</b> {{can be found on the}} Isle of Man TT motorcycle race course. It is much more dangerous than Silverstone because of the lack of runoff. When a rider falls off at Silverstone, he slides along slowly losing energy, with minimal injuries. When he falls off in the Manx, he impacts violently with trees and walls. Similarly, a clear zone alongside a freeway or other high speed road can prevent off-road excursions from becoming fixed-object crashes.|$|R
50|$|The old {{road safety}} {{paradigm}} of purely crash risk {{is a far}} more complex matter. Contributing factors to highway crashes {{may be related to the}} driver (such as driver error, illness, or fatigue), the vehicle (brake, steering, or throttle failures), or the road itself (lack of sight distance, poor <b>roadside</b> clear <b>zones,</b> etc.). Interventions may seek to reduce or compensate for these factors, or reduce the severity of crashes. A comprehensive outline of interventions areas can be seen in management systems for road safety.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Each year, {{due to the}} {{uncontrolled}} exit {{of vehicles}} from the roadway and hitting roadside obstacles-especially rollovers on embankments-huge costs are imposed on communities. For the reduction of such costs, different safety improvement programs may be implemented; for example guard installations, embankment slope reduction and/or the <b>roadside</b> clear <b>zone</b> enhancement. But the real problem always is the scarcity of available resources and how to allocate such scarce resources among the proposed alternatives and programs. In this research-work, by developing a specific approach, the optimized technique for the allocation of financial resources for safety improvement of roadside embankments is presented. Additionally, by developing special graphs, such facility is provided for planners and designers in different sections of road construction and maintenance to make optimum decisions either to install protective guards or to flatten roadside slopes. The results might also be beneficial for the correction and/or completion of the present related code of standards...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Invading species {{often are}} close relatives, and {{therefore}} share many characteristics {{as a consequence}} of their common ancestry. This tends to confound studies of invasions, since many irrelevant characteristics are likely to be correlated with a species geographic origin (alien or native). We address this problem by using phylogenetically independent comparisons to investigate the habitat characteristics of plants of the Central Plains Experimental Range (Colorado, U. S. A.). We initially show that exotic species are more likely than natives to occur in riparian <b>zones,</b> <b>roadsides,</b> and disturbed sites, and less likely to occur in grassland. The relationship between exotic origins and disturbed sites disappears when phylogenetic dependence is removed from the analyses; in contrast, the other associations persist following phylogenetic detrending, indicating that aliens and their native relatives consistently differ in their ability to exploit riparian, roadside, and grassland habitats. Our results indicate that disturbed sites currently are dominated by only a few groups of related exotic ruderals, while the ability to exploit <b>roadsides</b> and riparian <b>zones</b> has been and may continue to be important for the success of many taxa of invaders. Key words: biological invasions, comparative methods, disturbance, grasslands, phylogeny.

40|$|Governments are {{required}} to make difficult decisions, requiring policymakers {{to strike a balance}} between equity for individuals and the collective good. Specifically with regard to road safety at roadworks, policymakers must find an acceptable balance between cost, mobility and the safety of both road users and workers. Discussion of the ethical and legislative challenges associated with finding such a balance is largely absent from the Australian road safety context. By means of review and reflection relating to literature, policy and legislation, this paper explores aspects of governmental intervention and management of risk through the general lens of road safety ethics and regulation of the road network. More specifically, this paper presents a discussion of the ethical, legislative and economic challenges confronting practitioners required to select positive protection for <b>roadside</b> work <b>zones</b> in Queensland, Australia. The ‘so far as is reasonably practicable’ principle is explored for consistency both with legislation governing the management of road infrastructure and with governmental commitments to achieve zero harm. This paper concludes that disconnects exist between requirements for practitioners to manage the road efficiently and requirements for practitioners to provide a workplace that is ‘safe’...|$|R
40|$|A primary {{responsibility}} of the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) is to maintain a highway right of way that is safe for the traveling public.

40|$|Many good {{maintenance}} practices are done routinely to ensure safe travel on low-volume local roads. In addition, {{there are many}} specific treatments that may go beyond the point of routine maintenance and in fact provide additional safety benefits with a relatively low price tag. The purpose of this publication {{is to try to}} assemble many of these treatments that are currently practiced in Iowa by local agencies into one, easy-to-reference handbook that not only provides some clarity to each treatment with photos and narrative, but also features references to agencies currently using that technique. Some strategies that are utilized by Iowa, other states, and are topics of research have also been included to allow the user more information about possible options. Even though some areas overlap, the strategies presented have been grouped together in the following areas: Signing and Delineation, Traffic "Calming," Pavement Marking and Rumble Strips/Stripes, <b>Roadside</b> and Clear <b>Zone,</b> Guardrail and Barriers, Lighting, Pavements and Shoulders, Intersections, Railroad Crossings, Bridges and Culverts, and Miscellaneous. The intention is to make this a “living” document, which will continue to be updated and expanded periodically as other existing practices are recognized or new practices come into being...|$|R

40|$|Designing and {{maintaining}} a “forgivable roadside ” is an important con-cept to promote highway safety. However, {{it is not always}} possible, feasible or “affordable, ” particularly on Low-Volume Rural Roads (LVR). The results of recent research have provided reasonably good guidelines for roadside safety, barrier rail and end treatments on state highways and other major roads. Generally these sophisticated models and guidelines do not apply to LVR. Local governments have tens of thousands of miles of LVR where rights-of-way are narrow, clear zones and traversable slopes cannot be provided and budgets are inadequate for a multitude of competing problems. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) contracted with the authors to review the state-of-the-art of roadside safety, interview local roads personnel, study lo-cal roadside situations and develop guidelines on low-volume roads, roadside safety and barrier rail use. The computer program ROAD-SIDE was adapted to LVR conditions and simplified guidelines for its use where developed for LVR conditions. Computer results based on a range of Kansas LVR conditions were compiled and presented in a manual for easy use by Kansas personnel with responsibility for LVR safety. The paper presents information on adapting ROADSIDE for use on LVR and a sample of results from the Kansas Manual. Key words: guardrail, <b>roadside</b> safety, clear <b>zone,</b> low-volume road safety...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGlobally, the Road Safety Audit (RSA) {{concept has}} been {{recognized}} as an effective tool in examining the crash potential of in-service and future roadways in planning and design stages. As such, there is critical need for a practical tool {{that focuses on the}} safety of the existing, as-built, local road facilities. As requested by the World Bank, the RSA process has been developed for this purpose, giving specific recognition to the safety performance of roadside and median barriers for three existing, typical freeways in Jiangxi, China, and to the gathering of design experience for a new RGF project. On top of a routine road safety audit process, a total of 172 roadside crashes are collected, with 74 belonging to single vehicle Run-off-Road crashes, and crash records are analyzed to supplement the qualitative auditing suggestions. The structure and safety performance of the roadside and median barriers in the three freeways reviewed are evaluated and compared with their counterparts in the US barrier system. Several critical issues were identified and improvement suggestions were recommended, including less attention being paid to the <b>roadside</b> Clear Recovery <b>Zone</b> (CRZ), weak barrier structures, un-protected roadside obstacles (i. e. barrier ends, advertisement signs, drainage ditches, etc.), and poor connections or transitions of rails. Based on these observations, detailed pertinent countermeasures for each issue have been suggested in a roadside safety audit report for guiding roadside safety design in the RGF project...|$|R
40|$|Integrated {{assessment}} {{models have}} been used to explore cost effective abatement strategies in connection with negotiations on the Gothenburg protocol under the UN/ECE Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP). A variety of spatial and temporal issues must be addressed in order to model the multi-scalar processes involved and develop nested Integrated Assessment Models (n-IAM) useful both for further protocol negotiations and to address inter-relationships between local air quality, transboundary air pollution and climate change. We summarise the generic framework, highlighting the spatial characteristics of its' application to UK and European contexts, and identify the specific variations of the constituent models and data at each resolution. Encompassing NH 3, SO 2, NO X, particulates, O 3 and VOCs, it is clear a n-IAM must capture dynamics both beyond and through the current scales implemented by the UKIAM and ASAM. Ammonia abatement becomes significant at the micro scale using non-technical measures and buffer <b>zones,</b> <b>roadside</b> NO 2 is important at the urban scale, and the dynamics of O 3 stretch from the urban scale to the hemispheric level, affecting the fates of VOCs and NO X. Timescales implicit in dispersion models and empirical data, together with multi-scalar effects and policy scenarios must be mapped, and methodological approaches to critical loads and ecosystem recovery must be captured. At the UK National Focal Centre for Integrated Assessment Modelling work is ongoing linking the European scale ASAM and the national scale UKIAM, and progress is being made in linking these to global and urban scale integrated assessment models...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for seed-eating birds to disperse viable canola (Brassicaceae: Brassica napus) seeds and establish feral populations or disperse genetically modified cultivars {{was investigated in}} captive feeding trials determining the: 1) acceptability of canola as food, 2) passage time of canola through the gut (PT), and 3) viability of passed seed. Four dove/pigeon, one finch, and two duck species were tested. Only Crested Pigeons Ocyphaps lophotes and some Wood Ducks Chenonetta jubata ate canola seed in significant amounts {{in the presence of}} other food. Over 460 faecal pellets were examined for the presence of whole/ viable seed, but only seven pellets (∼ 1. 5 %), all from Wood Ducks, contained whole seed. Of the 11 passed seeds (represents < 0. 01 % of seed ingested by these ducks), only five germinated successfully (cf. 50 of 50 control seeds). Mean passage time of seed was quick for most species, ranging from 0. 5 h in Senegal Doves, Streptopelia senegalensis, 1. 3 h in Bronzewing Pigeons, to 2 - 3 h in the ducks C. jubata, and Anas superciliosa. This suggests that potential seed dispersal distances via these birds may generally be short (< 10 km). Although the passage of viable diaspores was rare, the large number of birds likely to be feeding on canola seed in agricultural fields or at spillages on <b>roadsides</b> and loading <b>zones</b> suggests there is the {{potential for}} birds to disperse viable canola seed, including viable seed from genetically modified canola crops. Management options such as avoiding large piles of spilt seed or storing canola seed near watercourses would minimize this risk. However, the eradication of any established feral herbicide-resistant GM-canola plants could remain problematical...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTThe sight {{distance}} (SD) on a three-dimensional (3 -d) compound curve {{has been studied}} recently {{in the absence of}} obstacles at road sides. Often, physical barriers are installed at road sides or in a roadway median for reducing potential collision severities; these rigid, semi-rigid, or even temporary cushion-type barriers can limit or reduce the driver's {{sight distance}}, depending on their horizontal offset distances away from the nearest edge of traveled way (ETW). The closer a barrier to the ETW is, the shorter the driver's sight distance would be. Since most barriers are constructed to prevent running-off road or crossing-median collisions, it is crucial to check whether the installation would reduce the driver's sight distance and potentially cause other traffic collisions such as rear-end or side swipe collisions. In this paper, an exact analytic framework is formulated with derived equations the first time to calculate the sight distance on a 3 -d compound curve {{in the presence of a}} median barrier, a roadside barrier, or a temporary cushion or barrier used for construction or other maintenance purposes. This framework provides an engineer a handy tool to examine the possible change of SD in the presence of a barrier and choose the required horizontal offset/clearance of a barrier from the nearest traveled way edge to meet certain design criteria or standards. This critical offset distance determined using this framework not only reinforces the importance of having <b>roadside</b> clearance recovery <b>zones</b> on highways but also provides a method to determine its horizontal clearance from a different standpoint. This analytic framework can easily be programmed into an Excel spreadsheet to evaluate the design of a physical barrier and its potential influence on sight distance along a 3 -d compound horizontal and vertical curve. Transportation engineers or practitioners may find this design tool handy and useful once the programmed spreadsheet is saved in a shared or a flash/thumb drive. Note that the sight distance on a two-dimensional curve, such as a horizontal or a vertical curve, can be calculated straightforward as special cases using the programmed spreadsheet...|$|R
