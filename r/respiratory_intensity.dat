40|$|The {{benefits}} of different wrap-films for Navalinda sweet cherry, packaged in small-format (consumer packages), were analysed. A {{storage and distribution}} process entailing eight days at 4 °C plus four days at 20 °C was simulated. The cherries were packed in punnets and film-wrapped with one macroperforated film and two microperforated films of 0. 30 (MAP. 30) and 0. 55 (MAP. 55) μmol cm/cm 2 atm day of CO 2 permeability at 0 °C. Packing in MAP at 0 °C did not alter the subsequent <b>respiratory</b> <b>intensity</b> of the fruits at 20 °C; however, the <b>respiratory</b> <b>intensity</b> at 20 °C did increase when the storage temperature was raised to 4 °C. The concentration of CO 2 (%) inside the packets at 20 °C was proportional to the permeability of the films: MAP. 30 (21 %) and MAP. 55 (15 %). The microperforated films preserved fruit acidity and firmness while slowing down the darkening of colour, loss of quality and decay. Shelf life was most effectively prolonged with MAP. 30 film. However, {{in view of the}} levels of hypoxia reached at 20 °C, its use is recommended only in the distribution and marketing processes with failsafe cold chains.

40|$|Concentrations of 10, 20 and 30 g/l of an edible coating {{based on}} {{derivatives}} of fatty acids and polysaccharides in alcohol solution were assayed {{to determine the}} effect on alteration of respiratory metabolism, control of transpiration and maintenance of post-harvest quality of >Picota> cherries. Treatment with 10 and 20 g/l coatings reduced the <b>respiratory</b> <b>intensity</b> of the fruits and attenuated the respiratory stress induced by low storage temperatures. After 2 weeks in storage at 0 °C plus 48 h at 20 °C, no off-flavours were detected, nor were there significant treatment-induced levels of ethanol and acetaldehyde. The weight loss of fruits during storage at 0 and 20 °C was inversely proportional to the concentration of the coating used. After storage, the fruits treated with concentrations of 10 and 30 g/l were shinier, more turgid and more attractive than the controls. None of the treatments produced significant changes in the evolution of quality parameters during storage, and they may therefore constitute an alternative technology to modified atmosphere packaging as currently used. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

In speech-language pathology, the few existing studies focusing on hippotherapy have primarily used subjective measurements such as questionnaires (e. g., Borton & Ogburn 2009). These studies suggested that children who participated in hippotherapy were believed (by their parents and others) to experience improved speech and language skills, increased motivation to attend therapy sessions, and improved self-concepts (Macauley & Gutierrez, 2004).

Light absorbance by the carapace of Gondogeneia antarctica and Djerboa furcipes was higher in the UVR (UVB + UVA) range (42. 1 % and 54. 5 % on average respectively) compared to the PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) range (38. 1 % and 50. 1 % respectively) of the solar spectrum. Bands of higher absorbance correlated with maximal absorbance ranges of sunscreening compounds indicating mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and carotenoids to be innate compounds of the exoskeleton of these species. Though the antioxidant enzyme catalase was photoinhibited, protein damage products did not accumulate under experimental exposure to a daily dose of 6. 84 kJ m(- 2) d(- 1) UVB, 66. 24 kJ m(- 2) d(- 1) UVA and 103. 14 kJ m(- 2) d(- 1) PAR.

40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) {{is often}} {{associated}} with substantial impairment of speech respiratory and phonatory control. However, the degree to which these impairments are related to abnormal laryngeal sensory function is unknown. This study examined whether individuals with PD exhibited abnormal and more asymmetric laryngeal somatosensory function compared with healthy controls, and whether these deficits were associated with disease and voice severity. Nineteen PD participants were tested and compared with 18 healthy controls. Testing included endoscopic assessment of laryngeal somatosensory function, with aerodynamic and acoustic assessment of respiratory and phonatory control, and clinical ratings of voice and disease severity. PD participants exhibited significantly abnormal and asymmetric laryngeal somatosensory function compared with healthy controls. Sensory deficits were significantly associated with timing of phonatory onset, voice <b>intensity,</b> <b>respiratory</b> driving pressure, laryngeal resistance, lung volume expended per syllable, disease severity, and voice severity. These results suggest that respiratory and phonatory control are influenced by laryngeal somatosensory function, that speech-related deficits in PD are related to abnormal laryngeal somatosensory function, and that this function may degrade as a function of disease severity. Thus, PD may represent a model of airway sensorimotor disintegration, highlighting the important role of the basal ganglia and related neural networks in the integration of laryngeal sensory input for speech-related motor control...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} some features of subpopulational profile and functional activity of monocytes in patients with acute pancreatitis. The study included 33 subjects with acute pancreatitis of middle-to-severe degree. Thirty-five healthy age-matched people served as a control group. The study of monocyte phenotype was performed by flow cytometry. Phagocytic ability of monocytes was determined by flow cytometry, by means of FITC-labeled staphylococcal protein A. We assessed percentage of fluorescent monocytes (defined as phagocytic index), like as average cell fluorescence (phagocytic number). The phagocytic indexes were determined for a total monocyte fraction, and well as for distinct cell subpopulations (CD 14 +CD 16 -, CD 14 dimCD 16 + и CD 14 lowCD 16 +). <b>Intensity</b> of <b>respiratory</b> burst in the monocytes was evauated with chemiluminescence analysis. We used two indicators (lucigenin and luminol) to assess production of primary and secondary reactive oxygen species. In the patients with acute pancreatitis, we have found certain changes in blood monocyte subpopulations and their functional activity. The changes in monocyte subpopulations in acute pancreatitis were characterized by increased numbers of inflammatory cell forms in blood (CD 14 lowCD 16 +), along with while near-normal contents of the cells with «classic» (CD 14 +CD 16 -) and «non-classical» phenotype (CD 14 dimCD 16 +), having been within reference ranges. It is assumed that high levels of pro-inflammatory monocytes may produce a pathogenetic «circuit» which is characterized by positive mutual stimulation of monocyte-mediated inflammation in local (pancreatic) and blood compartments. Apparent development of such mutual induction of inflammatory events may determine a low efficiency of anti-inflammatory therapy in acute pancreatitis. The functional characteristics of the monocytes in patients with acute pancreatitis are defined as a decrease in phagocytic activity and low <b>respiratory</b> burst <b>intensity.</b> Reduced phagocytic activity of monocytes was detectable in all the cellular subpopulations. Decreased <b>intensity</b> of monocytic <b>respiratory</b> burst in acute pancreatitis depends on low background and induced synthesis of both primary and secondary reactive oxygen species. Thus the patients with acute pancreatitis exhibit imbalanced with respect to synthesis of primary and secondary reactive oxygen species in the monocytes may result from specific action of circulating pancreatic enzymes upon the cells, or due to increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The imbalance between the monocyte subpopulations and reduction of their functional activity in acute pancreatitis may represent an immunopathogenetic basis for development of pancreatic necrosis and sepsis...|$|R
40|$|Potassium-deficient plants {{commonly}} {{have much}} higher respiration rates than their high-potassium controls. In {{view of the}} evidence that <b>respiratory</b> <b>intensity</b> is largely controlled by the internal level of phosphate acceptors like adenosine diphosphate, an attempt was made to determine whether potassium deficiency does in fact affect the free nucleotide contents of plants in any such manner as would explain the respiratory effect along these lines. Serious difficulties of technique •were encountered in estimating the nucleotides, and these have not been completely satisfactorily overcome. Certain widely used techniques were found wanting in various respects. Precipitation methods involving barium and zinc wore tested on both authentic adenine nucleotides and leaf preparations. These were abandoned, owing principally to variable recoveries of authentic nucleotides and to the presence of large quantities of precipitable impurities in leaf extracts. Precipitation with ethanol, a commonly used method for removing such interfering substances, was found to cause considerable losses of the nucleotides. Selective adsorption of nucleotides by various charcoals was found to induce an anomalous behaviour of AMP as regards its elution position when chromatographed on Dowex- 1 -chloride. This effect, whose nature is unknown, was a property of all the charcoals tested. Water extraction, following a short pre-immersion in boiling ethanol, was adopted for most of the analyses, but perchloric acid was sometimes used as the extractant; this acid -ma shown to release considerable quantities of bound nucleotides. Analyses of the free nucleotides in leaves of high- and low-potassium barley by chromatography on Dowex- 1 -Chloride and formate columns furnished no evidence of significant changes therein as a result of potassium deficiency. It is tentatively concluded that the enhanced respiration of potassium deficient barley must be primarily due to factors other than the levels of detectable free nucleotides.

Assessing the biodegradation potential of indigenous microorganisms by measuring the <b>respiratory</b> <b>intensity</b> {{with the addition of}} PAHs in sediment samples {{was also one of the}} aims of this study. The results show that the total PAH concentrations of the sediments were 99. 23 - 345. 53 ng/g dry weight (d. w.), and the PAHs composition pattern in the sediments was dominated by phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene. The numbers of phenanthrene. fluoranthene and pyrene-degrading bacteria during three cruises were 1. 42 x 10 (3) - 8. 93 x 10 (4) CFU/g d. w., 8. 29 x 10 (3) - 9. 43 x 10 (4) CFU/g d. w. and 7. 05 x 10 (3) - 9. 43 x(4) CFU/g d. w., respectively. The addition of three model PAH compounds (phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene) showed a great influence on the increasing of the microbial activity in the sediments. And there was a significant correlation among the change of respiratory activity, PAH concentration and the number of PAH-degrading bacteria.

30|$|Fruit {{is one of}} {{important}} tissues in fruited plants, which harbors seed formation, development, and maturity. According to <b>respiratory</b> <b>intensity</b> during ripening, fruit is divided into climacteric and non-climacteric phenotypes. The climacteric fruit must release massive ethylene at ripening, also called ethylene-dependent fruit. On the contrary, the non-climacteric fruit is ethylene-independent. To date, ethylene-dependent fleshy-fruits are the primary materials for studying fruit ripening, such as tomato, apple, and banana. In ethylene-dependent fruits, ERF, as the final response gene in ethylene signaling pathway, directly regulate fruit ripening by binding to the promoters of their downstream genes, including ACO, ACS, PG, EXP, and PSY (Han et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2014). At present, LeERF 1, MaERF 9, MdERF 1, and MdERF 3 has been reported as the positive activator (Li et al. 2007, 2016; Wang et al. 2007; Xiao et al. 2013), whereas SlERF 6, MaERF 11, and MdERF 2 are the negative repressors for fruit ripening (Han et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2012). Of these ERFs, MaERF 9 and MaERF 11 could not only regulate the transcription levels of ACO 1 and ACS 1 by binding to their promoter, but also physically interacted with ACO 1 (Xiao et al. 2013). Interestingly, MaERF 11 also interact with MaHDA 1, the complex repress expression levels of downstream genes targeted by MaERF 11 via histone deacetylation (Han et al. 2016). Moreover, the regulatory route of ERF genes is intricate during fruit ripening. In apple, MdERF 2 presents at least three roads in regulating MdACS expression. MdERF 2 repressor and MdERF 3 activator could regulate the transcription level of MdACS by binding to their promoter, respectively. Meanwhile, MdERF 2 inhibit MdERF 3 activity by combining to the DRE element in the promoter, indirectly suppressed the expression level of MdACS. Thirdly, a directly interaction between MdERF 2 and MdERF 3 restrain the binding of MdERF 3 to the MdACS promoter, and then suppress the MdACS expressed in fruit flesh (Li et al. 2016). In tomato, SlERF.B 3 {{has the ability to}} activate the regulatory network for fruit ripening. A dominant repressor version of SlERF.B 3 (SlERF.B 3 -SRDX) down-regulates ethylene receptor levels, but enhances triple response and up-regulated the expression levels of EIN 3 -like gene, contributing to an acceleration of fruit ripening (Liu et al. 2013). Further study found that SlERF.B 3 -SRDX could alter the expression pattern of other ERF family members. Most notably, SlERF.B 3 -SRDX also stimulate the transcription levels of ripening regulators, including RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN), NON-RIPENING (NOR), COLORLESS NON-RIPENING (CNR), and Homeodomain-leucine zipper HOMEOBOX (HB- 1) (Liu et al. 2014). Therefore, the regulatory role of AP 2 /ERF TF is multiple, and their regulated mechanism is very complex during fruit ripening.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThere {{is a lack}} of systematised {{information}} on respiratory sounds of healthy people. This impairs health professionals from differentiating respiratory sounds of healthy people from people with respiratory diseases, which may affect patients' diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to characterise respiratory sounds of healthy people. MethodsThe Web of knowledge, MEDLINE, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases were searched and studies using computerised analyses to detect/characterise respiratory sounds in healthy people were included. Data were extracted using a structured table-format. ResultsSixteen cross-sectional studies assessing respiratory sounds in 964 subjects (aged 1 day- 70 yrs) were included: 13 investigated normal <b>respiratory</b> sounds (frequency, <b>intensity</b> and amplitude) and 3 adventitious respiratory sounds (crackles and wheezes). The highest sound frequencies were observed at the trachea (inspiration: 447 – 1323  Hz; expiration: 206 – 540  Hz). Women (444 – 999  Hz) and infants (250 – 400  Hz) presented the highest frequencies at maximum power. Inspiratory sounds were more intense at the left posterior lower lobe (5. 7 – 76. 6  dB) and expiratory sounds at the trachea (45. 4 – 85. 1  dB). Nevertheless, studies establishing direct comparisons between inspiratory and expiratory sounds showed that inspiratory sounds presented the highest intensities (p <  0. 001). Amplitude was higher at the left upper anterior chest (1. 7  ±  0. 8  V) and lower at the right posterior lower lobe (1. 2  ±  0. 7  V). Crackles were the adventitious respiratory sound most frequently reported. ConclusionsRespiratory sounds show different acoustic properties depending on subjects' characteristics, subjects' position, respiratory flow and place of recording. Further research with robust study designs, different populations and following the guidelines for computerised respiratory sound analysis are urgently needed to build evidence-base...|$|R

We screened each publication for specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. We then identified and qualitatively summarized the use of mobile outcome assessments in clinical research, including the type and design of the study, therapeutic focus, type of mobile device(s) used, and specific mobile outcomes reported. Results The search retrieved 2, 530 potential articles of interest. After screening, 88 publications remained. Twenty-five percent of publications (n= 22) described mobile outcomes used in interventional research, and the rest (n= 66) described observational clinical research. Thirteen therapeutic areas were represented. Five categories of mobile devices were identified—inertial sensors, biosensors, pressure sensors and walkways, medication adherence monitors, and location monitors; inertial sensors/accelerometers were most common (reported in 86 % of publications). Among the variety of mobile outcomes, various assessments of physical activity were most common (reported in 74 % of publications). Other mobile outcomes included assessments of sleep, mobility, and pill adherence, as well as biomarkers assessed using a mobile device, including cardiac, glucose, gastric reflux, <b>respiratory</b> measures and <b>intensity</b> of head-related injury. Conclusion Mobile devices are being widely used in clinical research to assess outcomes, although their use in interventional research to assess therapeutic effectiveness is limited. For mobile devices to be used more frequently in pivotal interventional research – such as trials informing regulatory decision-making – more focus should be placed on: 1) consolidating the evidence supporting the clinical meaningfulness of specific mobile outcomes, and 2) standardizing the use of mobile devices in clinical research to measure specific mobile outcomes (e. g., data capture frequencies, placement of device). To that aim, this manuscript offers a broad overview of the various mobile outcome assessments currently used in observational and interventional research, and categorizes and consolidates this information for researchers interested in using mobile devices to assess outcomes in interventional research. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background Conventional cine MRI {{provides}} data on {{the variation}} of cardiac dimensions across the cardiac cycle; cardiac function analysis primarily focuses on the difference between end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) dimensions of {{the left and right}} ventricles (LV and RV). With cardiorespiratory-synchronized (CRS) CMR, there is an additional effective dimension of information available, related to the effect of the respiratory cycle phase on cardiac dimensions. However, there are currently no established ways to analyze this potentially useful additional physiological data. We have developed a set of tools for the functional analysis of CRS CMR, particularly {{for the study of the}} respiratory effects on LV-RV interaction, and derived some initial normative values for the results. Methods We have developed a set of interactive CMR function analysis programs. Images from CRS CMR are organized in a two-dimensional matrix, sorted by cardiac and respiratory cycle phases. The user can interactively position an analysis line across the ventricles in a representative image; this line can then be automatically tracked across the other cardiac and <b>respiratory</b> phases. The <b>intensity</b> profile along the line is then used to automatically track the corresponding positions of the edges of the LV and RV free walls and the interventricular septum (IVS). A variety of absolute and normalized variables can be derived from these varying positions, including ED and ES dimensions, and displayed as functional images over the cardiac and respiratory cycle dimensions. CRS CMR was performed with a sparsity-based method (XD-GRASP), using continuous acquisition of radial k-space samples with golden-angle increments and retrospective cardiac and respiratory phase sorting in reconstruction. An initial set of CRS CMR data from 9 normal subjects (age 28. 33 ± 5. 85) was analyzed, as well as from 3 patients (age 40 ± 9. 66, one with HCM). Results On visual inspection of the images, it is apparent that there is a clear shift in the relative position of the IVS over the respiratory cycle, to the left in inspiration and to the right in expiration, reflecting the LV-RV interaction; this is much more prominent near ED than ES. For the normal subjects, in midlevel short-axis views, the respiratory-related absolute shift in IVS position was 1. 07 - 3. 23 mm at ED and 0. 69 - 2. 14 mm at ES; corresponding values normalized to ED dimension were 2. 65 - 7. 08 pp and 1. 99 - 5. 18 pp. The ED-ES difference for the normalized shift ranges was - 1. 9 - 4. 35 pp (median 1. 35, first quartile 0. 68). For the HCM patient, the difference between the shift ranges was 0. 79 pp. Linear regression when plotting NCD against NEDD (reflecting the Frank-Starling relationship and giving an estimate of contractility) was 0. 68 ± 0. 11 in the normal subjects. Conclusions Novel physiologic data on LV-RV interaction can be derived from CRS CMR; this seems to show consistent ranges in normal subjects, and may provide useful information on disease-related changes in cardiac function...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho objetivou determinar a ocorrência de injúria pelo frio em abacates 'Hass'. Na primeira Etapa, os abacates foram armazenados a 5 ºC (77 % UR), 10 ºC (79 % UR) e 15 ºC (79 % UR) por até 21 dias. Aos 7; 14 e 21 dias de armazenamento, um lote com 36 frutos foi levado ao ambiente (22 °C e 77 % UR) para amadurecimento. Testou-se também o armazenamento a 2 °C (74 % UR) e 4 °C (77 % UR) por até 45 dias, sendo que aos 15; 30 e 45 dias, um lote com a mesma quantidade de frutos foi levado ao ambiente, mantido a 22 °C e 77 % UR. Frutos armazenados ao ambiente, desde o início, foram considerados testemunha. Avalaram-se a aparência e a luminosidade da polpa. Os frutos armazenados a 10 °C e 15 °C não apresentaram sintomas de injúrias pelo frio, que foram observados nos frutos armazenados a 2 °C, por períodos superiores a 15 dias, e nos mantidos a 4 °C, por 30 dias. Quando levados ao ambiente, os frutos armazenados a 2 °C conservaram aparência aceitável para o consumo (nota = 3) por até 10 dias, e os armazenados a 4 °C, por até 12 dias. Na segunda Etapa, analisaram-se a intensidade respiratória e a atividade das enzimas {{peroxidase}} (POD), polifenoloxidase (PPO), poligalacturonase (PG) e pectinametilesterase (PME) nos frutos armazenados a 2 ºC, por 45 dias, em comparação com os testemunha. A atividade das enzimas associadas ao escurecimento, POD e PPO, assim como das associadas ao amaciamento da polpa, PME e PG, foi inibida pelo armazenamento a 2 ºC, mas readquiriram atividade mais elevada que nos frutos-testemunha, quando foram transferidos ao ambiente, indicando estímulo devido aos danos pelo frio. This study {{aimed to}} determine the occurrence of chilling injury in 'Hass' avocado. In the first step, the avocados were stored at 5 ºC (77 % RH), 10 °C (79 % RH), and 15 ºC (79 % RH) for up to 21 days. At 7, 14, and 21 days of storage, one lot with 36 fruits {{was taken to the}} environment (22 °C and 77 % RH) for maturation. Storage of fruit at 2 °C (74 % RH) and 4 °C (77 % RH) for up to 45 days was also tested; at 15, 30, and 45 days, a batch of the same quantity of fruits was taken to environment and was maintained at 22 °C and 77 % RH. Fruits stored in the environment from the beginning were considered control treatment. Appearance and brightness of the pulp were evaluated. Fruits stored at 10 °C and 15 °C showed no symptoms of chilling injuries, however, such symptoms were observed in the fruits stored at 2 °C for periods exceeding 15 days and in the fruits kept at 4 °C for 30 days. Fruits stored at 2 °C, when brought to the environment, retained acceptable appearance for consumption (score = 3) up to 10 days, while those ones stored at 4 °C retained acceptable appearance for up to 12 days. In the second step, the <b>respiratory</b> <b>intensity</b> and enzymes activity of peroxidase (POD), polyphenoloxidase (PPO), polygalacturonase (PG), and pectinametilesterase (PME) in fruits stored at 2 °C for 45 days were analyzed and compared with the control fruits. The activity of enzymes associated with browning, POD and PPO, as well as enzymes associated with the pulp softening, PME and PG, was inhibited by storage at 2 °C, but regained activity higher than in control fruits, when they were transferred to the environment, indicating stimulation due to the chilling injury...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a influência do tipo de descasque, manual, mecânico e enzimático, e do armazenamento, a 5 ºC e 10 ºC e ambiente (21 - 23 ºC), na vida útil de laranjas 'Pêra' do tipo Rio, minimamente processadas. As laranjas foram colhidas maduras, e imediatamente lavadas, higienizadas e descascadas. Após a eliminação da casca, as frutas foram desinfetadas e embaladas em bandejas de isopor revestidas com filme PVC esticável. Durante o armazenamento sob as diferentes temperaturas, avaliaram-se a aparência, a quantidade de suco drenado, o aparecimento de podridões, a perda de massa fresca, a intensidade respiratória, os conteúdos de O 2 e CO 2 no {{interior}} das embalagens, a coloração, os teores de ácido ascórbico (AA) e de sólidos solúveis totais (SST), e acidez titulável (AT), assim como a relação SST/AT. Foram realizadas avaliações microbiológicas, bem como testes de aceitabilidade e de preferência de compra pelo consumidor. Somente os produtos descascados enzimaticamente (DE) apresentaram perda de suco, que aumentou com o tempo e a temperatura de armazenamento. A perda de massa fresca ocorreu em todos os produtos, mas os DE e os armazenados a 21 - 23 ºC apresentaram os maiores valores. Todas as laranjas processadas apresentaram pico respiratório na primeira hora após o descascamento, seguido de redução e estabilização. O descascamento enzimático e as menores temperaturas de armazenamento levaram aos teores mais elevados de O 2 e aos mais baixos de CO 2, nas embalagens. As frutas processadas apresentarem baixa contagem de microrganismos mesófilos, psicrófilos e coliformes totais, e ausência de coliformes fecais. Podridões apareceram nas descascadas manual (DM) e mecanicamente (DME) após 13 dias, 8 dias e 4 dias a 5 ºC e 10 ºC e ambiente (21 - 23 ºC), respectivamente. Os produtos obtidos com descascamento manual (DM) não diferiram dos DME ou DE, quanto aos teores de AT, SST e AA e relação SST/AT. Os produtos DM e DME, armazenados a 5 ºC, foram os preferidos pelos provadores e apresentaram boa aparência por 19 dias e bom sabor por 23 dias. Os DE e armazenados a 5 ºC apresentaram boa aparência por 4 dias e sabor desagradável no 1 º dia. The aim of {{this work}} was to evaluate the influence of type of peeling, manual, mechanic and enzymatic, and temperature of storage, 5 ºC, 10 ºC and ambient (21 - 23 ºC) on the shelf-life of minimally processed 'Pera' type Rio oranges. Ripe oranges were picked and immediately washed and peeled. After peeled, fruits were disinfected and packed on polystyrene trays recovered with stretchable PVC film. During storage, was evaluated the appearance, amount of juice loss, rotting, loss of fresh mass, <b>respiratory</b> <b>intensity,</b> level of O 2 and CO 2 inside the packages, color, contents of total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA) and ascorbic acid (AA) and the ratio TSS/TA. Microbiological evaluations were made as well as testing acceptance and preference by the consumer. Only enzymatically peeled products presented juice loss that increased with storage time. There was continuous loss of fresh mass in every product, but peeled products stored at 21 - 23 ºC presented the greatest losses. Processed oranges presented a respiratory peak at the first hour after peeling followed by reduction and stabilization at 11 th- 13 th hour. The enzymatic peeling and the lowest storage temperatures produces the highest contents of O 2 and the lowest of CO 2 in packages. Processed fruits presented low counting of microorganisms, mesophilic, psychrotrophs and coliforms. Fecal coliforms were not detected. Rotting appeared on manually and mechanically peeled after 13 days at 5 ºC, 8 days at 10 ºC or 4 days at 21 - 23 ºC. Products obtained from manual peeling {{did not differ from}} mechanically or enzymatically peeled related to contents of TA, TSS and AA and the ratio (TSS/TA). Products manually or mechanically peeled, and stored at 5 ºC, were considered the best by the tasters and presented good appearance during 19 days and good taste for 23 days. Products enzymatically peeled and stored at 5 ºC presented good appearance for four days and unpleasant taste in the first day...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} {{is to make a}} contribution to the problem in what degree the thermal reaction of the respiratory metabolism in insects is qualitatively or quantitatively changed when subjected experimentally for some length of time to variations in the thermal environment. The material under investigation consists of imagines of Stauroderus bicolor CHARP. (Orthoptera), Formica rufa L. (Hymenoptera), Stomoxys calcitrans L. (Diptera), Forficula auricularia L. (Dermaptera), larvae of Ephestia kühniella Z. (Lepidoptera) and Byrrhus pilula L. (Coleoptera), as well as pupae of Phalera bucephala L. (Lepidoptera). The test groups of the different species examined are transferred from an originally uniform environment, i. e. the same limited habitat to three different thermal enviromnents, + 5 °C, + 30 °C and c:a + 18 °C. At more or less regular intervals test animals were taken from these groups and their oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were determined at + 18 °C. The respiratory exchange at + 18 °C is thus used as an index of eventual metabolic changes caused by the change in the thermal environment. The measurements are made with the Thunberg-microrespirometer. In a few cases the respiratory measurements have been supplemented by investigation of the possible change in the resistance to cold. The results of the various experiments are discussed in two parts, Discussion I, dealing with insects, which during the experimental period were not changed by a metamorphosis, and Discussion II, dealing with the pupae of Phalera bucephala, which more or less undergo a metamorphosis independently of the temperature. A theoretical survey is made in Discussion I of various possibilities of a change in the potential respiration due to a changed environmental temperature. On this basis the separate experimental results are then discussed. All the test animals show a quantitatively or qualitatively changed gas metabolism caused by the previous environmental temperature. In Stauroderus bicolor the respiratory rate decreases more and more rapidly the higher the environmental temperature. This is assumed to be an effect of fasting. The other test animals show either a decrease in the potential respiration measured at + 18 ° C, which sets in rapidly for both heat and cold influence (Forficula auricularia and Ephestia kiihniella), or a more or less gradual increase in the potential respiration both through the influence of high and lowered environmental temperature (Formica rufa, Stomoxys calcitrans and Byrrhus pilula). Several possible explanations are discussed: compensatory adjustment of the metabolism to the environmental temperature, systematically altered temperature coefficient, remaining thermal effect, or reduction in vitality. In connexion with the increased respiratory quotient, which occurs at high temperature is discussed the existence of eventual anoxybiotic processes. A systematic change in RQ in Byrrhus pilula is assumed to be organically connected with its hibernation. Discussion II deals with the results of the experiments with the hibernating pupae of Phalera bucephali. The respiratory quantity and quality are chiefly affected by the developmental state of the pupae but can be altered by the effect of a different thermal environment. During the development the pupae have a period of minimal metabolism which is characterized by an extremely low RQ, below 0. 1. If the pupae are kept constantly at + 18 ° C and so the normal decrease in temperature at the coming of winter fails to take place, a diapause is induced with low <b>respiratory</b> <b>intensity</b> and a constantly low RQ. A fall of temperature to + 5 ° C, on the other hand, increases the developmental ability; a latent development sets in; the rate of the potential respiration increases gradually, mainly due to increased thermal sensibility, and the RQ becomes stabilized at a constant and higher value. Finally, if the pupae are returned to higher environmental temperature, + 18 ' C, a strong respiratory increase occurs and. the RQ attains a still higher constant value, a subitan development commences, and the pupae emerge before long. An extremely high environmental temperature, + 30 ° C seems to some degree to be able to break the diapause {{in the same way as}} a low one. In combination with the various developmental phases of the pupae, those metabolic processes are discussed, which are likely to cause the low RQ, and reasons are submitted for an assumption of two simultaneous metabolic types, one conversion of fat into carbohydrate and the other a complete combustion of the latter substance. With rising state of development, the pupae change from conversion type of metabolism to combustion type. The experiments are supplemented by an investigation of the dependence of respiration on temperature with progressive pupal development. A decrease in the RQ has been observed with rising temperature. The relationship between conversion and combustion processes are discussed in this connexion. The actual loss in water is calculated for various test groups of pupae from the combination of the gas exchange and the loss in weight, and it seems mainly to depend on the environmental temperature and not on the magnitude of the metabolism. There is a thermal optimum for the cost of production of the imago...|$|E
