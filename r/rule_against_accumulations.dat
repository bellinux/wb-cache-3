40|$|The Rule Against Perpetuities {{is dying}} an ignoble death. To attract trust {{business}} and the lawyers 2 ̆ 7 fees and trustees 2 ̆ 7 commissions that come with it, twenty states have abolished the Rule as applied to interests in trust. But the Rule Against Perpetuities {{is not the only}} rule of property law that bears on trust duration. Another is the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> <b>accumulations</b> of income, which limits the timeframe during which a settlor may direct the trustee to accumulate and retain income in trust. For 200 years, the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> <b>accumulations</b> of income has lurked in the shadow of its older and more distinguished cousin, the Rule Against Perpetuities. But with the race to abolish the Rule Against Perpetuities, the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> <b>accumulations</b> of income may have newfound relevance. Perpetual trusts are more likely than ordinary trusts to involve accumulations of income in trust. Accordingly, the task for this short essay is to examine the lurking <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> <b>accumulations</b> of income and its potential impact on the 100 billion perpetual trust industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{central theme}} of this study {{comprises}} the judicial and legislative rules developed to restrict attempts by men of property to endow their families in perpetuity, usually with land, in such manner that each successive living generation can neither part with the property nor prevent unborn generations from succeeding to it. Part One deals with attempts to accomplish this object by bestowing the whole title on each living generation but denying each such generation the power {{to dispose of the}} property or to prevent its· descent to the next generation. In this part the principal restrictive rules are judicial, the common-law rules against restraints on alienation. Part Two deals with attempts to accomplish the same object by splitting the title into present and future estates; bestowing only an estate for life on the currently living generation and conveying future estates directly to unborn generations, so that the currently living generation cannot cut them off. In this part the principal restrictive rules are likewise judicial, the common law Rule Against Perpetuities and the common-law <b>Rule</b> <b>Against</b> <b>Accumulations.</b> Part Two also deals with a partial statutory substitute for the common law <b>Rule</b> <b>Against</b> <b>Accumulations</b> which was in force in Michigan from 1847 to 1952. Part Three deals with a group of Michigan statutes, applicable to dispositions of land made between 184 7 and 1949, which partially superseded the common-law Rule Against Perpetuities and supplemented, but did not supersede, the common-law rules against restraints on alienation.

40|$|Trusts {{were first}} created in England many centuries ago by {{settling}} property upon protective Trusts whereby the income {{was paid to}} successive generations whilst the corpus was maintained intact thereby avoiding death duty. To prevent this, rules were formulated some 250 years ago to prevent the indefinite "tying-up" of property and these still apply today and are generally {{referred to as the}} Rules Against Perpetuity. In New Zealand these Rules have recently been amended but briefly they are to the effect that property may be placed in Trust for the period of a life in being plus 21 years thereafter or for 80 years. Similarly until the Perpetuities Act, 1964, it was permissible to accumulate income only for a very restricted period and as a result the compilers of Trust Deeds had to be wary that they did not infringe this law which became known as the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> <b>accumulations.</b> This, however, was abolished with the Perpetuities Act, 1964, and it is now permissible to accumulate income for the full period of the Trust. Many notable authorities have upheld the right of the individual to order his affairs {{in such a way as}} to preserve as much as possible of his funds intact for transmission to his beneficiaries. The classical dictum which has been quoted in many subsequent cases was that of Lord Tomlin in the Duke of Westminister v Inland Revenue Commissioners # 1936 # when he said, "every man is entitled if he can to order his affairs so that the Tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be". Planning an Estate and the introduction of a Trust into that plan requires a careful consideration of many varied, and often conflicting objectives. It also involves assessing existing problems and visualising those that may develop in future...|$|E

Each chapter finishes with a summary of relevant legal principles, making the book unusually accessible. Since the publication of the third edition in 2007, a number of significant cases have been decided in the area of trusts: - In relation to apparently explicit declarations of trust, Byrnes v Kendle (2011) 243 CLR 253 has changed the law laid down in the earlier High Court decision of Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Qld) v Jolliffe (1920) 28 CLR 178. The decision in Jolliffe had been unchallenged in more than 90 years. - In the area of the fiduciary’s accountability for bribes taken in breach of fiduciary duty, two recent decisions are included: Sinclair Investments (UK) Ltd v Versailles Trade Finance Ltd (in administrative receivership) [2011] 3 WLR 1153 and the contrary opinion of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Grimaldi v Chameleon Mining NL (No 2) [2012] FCAFC 6. - In the area of charitable trusts discussion of Aid/Watch Incorporated v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2010) 241 CLR 539 is included. - The impact of the Personal Property Security Act 2009 (Cth) on Romalpa clauses is also discussed...|$|R
