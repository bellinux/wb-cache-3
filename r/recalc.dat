40|$|Owing to its size, {{accessibility}} and erosional level, the Rochechouart impact structure, dated at ~ 203 +/- 2 Ma (<b>recalc.),</b> is {{a unique}} reser-voir of knowledge within {{the population of the}} rare terrestrial analogous to large impacts craters observed on planetary surfaces. The site gives direct access to fundamental mechanisms both in impact-related geology (origin and evolution of planets) and biology (habitability of planets, emergence and evolution of life). For the last decade P. Lambert has been installing Rochechouart as International Natural Laboratory for studying impact processes and collateral effects on planetary surfaces. For this purpose the Center for International Research on Impacts and on Rochechouart (CIRIR) was installed on site in 2016 with twofold objectives and activities. First ones are scientific and dedicated to the scientific community. The second are cultural and educational and are dedi-cated to the public sensu lato. We present here the CIRIR, its scientific programs and the related reseach opportunities...|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} as-run {{analysis of the}} AGR- 1 irradiation experiment. AGR- 1 {{is the first of}} eight planned irradiations for the Advanced Gas Reactor (AGR) Fuel Development and Qualification Program. Funding for this program is provided by the US Department of Energy (DOE) as part of the Next-Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) project. The objectives of the AGR- 1 experiment are: 1. To gain experience with multi-capsule test train design, fabrication, and operation with the intent to reduce the probability of capsule or test train failure in subsequent irradiation tests. 2. To irradiate fuel produced in conjunction with the AGR fuel process development effort. 3. To provide data that will support the development of an understanding of the relationship between fuel fabrication processes, fuel product properties, and irradiation performance. In order to achieve the test objectives, the AGR- 1 experiment was irradiated in the B- 10 position of the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for a total duration of 620 effective full power days of irradiation. Irradiation began on December 24, 2006 and ended on November 6, 2009 spanning 13 ATR cycles and approximately three calendar years. The test contained six independently controlled and monitored capsules. Each capsule contained 12 compacts of a single type, or variant, of the AGR coated fuel. No fuel particles failed during the AGR- 1 irradiation. Final burnup values on a per compact basis ranged from 11. 5 to 19. 6 %FIMA, while fast fluence values ranged from 2. 21 to 4. 39 ? 1025 n/m 2 (E > 0. 18 MeV). We’ll say something here about temperatures once thermal <b>recalc</b> is done. Thermocouples performed well, failing at a lower rate than expected. At the end of the irradiation, nine of the originally-planned 19 TCs were considered functional. Fission product release-to-birth (R/B) ratios were quite low. In most capsules, R/B values {{at the end of the}} irradiation were at or below 10 - 7 with only one capsule significantly exceeding this value. A maximum R/B of around 2 ? 10 - 7 was reached at the end of the irradiation in Capsule 5. Several shakedown issues were encountered and resolved during the first three cycles. These include the repair of minor gas line leaks; repair of faulty gas line valves; the need to position moisture monitors in regions of low radiation fields for proper functioning; the enforcement of proper on-line data storage and backup, the need to monitor thermocouple performance, correcting for detector spectral gain shift, and a change in the mass flow rate range of the neon flow controllers...|$|E
40|$|Exptl. data {{presented}} by L. M. Gan et al. are reinterpreted {{with the use}} of the error-in-variables method. The <b>recalcd.</b> reactivity ratios in microemulsion hardly deviate from earlier reported bulk copolymn. values. Furthermore it is shown that monomer sequence distribution as a function of copolymer compn. is equally well described by bulk reactivity ratios as it is by microemulsion reactivity ratios. This can easily be explained from the fact that the relation between monomer sequence distribution and copolymer compn. is governed by the reactivity ratio product, rather than by the sep. reactivity ratios. It is found that the reactivity ratio product in microemulsion does not significantly deviate from that in bul...|$|R
40|$|A new {{occurrence}} of colusite [12197 - 68 - 1] in vugs of marble quarried at Lorano, near Carrara, Apuan Alps, Italy, is reported. The tetrahedral bronze-brown crystals are cubic, space group P 43 n. Two different crystals of colusite were studied by x-ray diffraction and electron-microprobe methods. One crystal, with cell edge a 10. 538 Å, has a compn. corresponding to Cu 26 V 2 As 6 S 32,,whereas the other crystal, with a 10. 621 Å, has the compn. Cu 26 V 2 As 4 Sn 2 S 32. Published anal. data were <b>recalcd.</b> on {{a basis of}} 66 atoms per unit cell. Reflectance, measured at 470, 546, 589 and 650 nm, varies 26. 7 - 32 % in air and 13. 3 - 17. 9 % in oil...|$|R
