25|$|Hermit's Rest, {{another one}} of Colter's fantasy buildings, was {{constructed}} {{at the head of}} the Hermit Trail in 1914 to serve as a <b>refreshment</b> <b>stand</b> and gift shop. Constructed of native stones and massive logs, the building seemed to have grown in its setting, and was carefully screened by vegetation. Its most impressive feature was its enormous fireplace.|$|E
25|$|By 1980, the Conservancy {{was also}} engaged in design efforts and {{long-term}} restoration planning, using both its own staff and external consultants. It provided the impetus and leadership for several early restoration projects {{funded by the}} city, preparing a comprehensive plan for rebuilding the park. The restoration {{was accompanied by a}} crucial restructuring of management, whereby the park was subdivided into zones, to each of which a supervisor was designated, responsible for maintaining restored areas. That year, the Dairy (which was originally designed as a <b>refreshment</b> <b>stand</b> and rest spot) was transformed into the park's first visitor's center, with the Conservancy using it to revitalize public interest in the park through exhibits, music series, and children's programs. The first landscape to be restored was the Sheep Meadow, primarily with funds provided by New York State. During the next few years, Bethesda Terrace and Fountain, Belvedere Castle, and the East Green were restored.|$|E
500|$|In October 1895, {{before the}} visit of Manchester City to Bank Street, the club {{purchased}} a 2,000-capacity stand from Broughton Rangers Rugby League Club, and put up another stand on the [...] "reserved side" [...] (as distinct from the [...] "popular side"). However, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000. Improvements to the ground were restricted by the running track that encompassed the pitch, which, by {{the request of the}} Bradford and Clayton Athletic Company, could not be removed. However, the ground came into the possession of the club's former president, Mr W. Crompton, in 1898, allowing them to make whatever improvements to it they desired. One report in the Manchester Courier predicted the addition of a [...] tall stand on the side adjacent to Bank Street itself, with a <b>refreshment</b> <b>stand</b> underneath, while the opposite stand would be moved back [...] and raised up on brickwork by around , with the space underneath to be used as changing rooms for the players and referee and various rooms for the club committee.|$|E

2500|$|The {{park was}} {{expanded}} to [...] in 1900, and in 1914 a still-standing brick pavilion {{was built to}} house a <b>refreshment</b> <b>stand,</b> restrooms, and space for open-air concerts.|$|E
2500|$|Located in Orient Heights {{is one of}} Boston's {{more popular}} public beaches, Constitution Beach. The easternmost portion of the beach is known to locals as [...] "Shay's Beach." [...] The beach {{underwent}} renovations in the late 1990s as a new public bathhouse and <b>refreshment</b> <b>stand</b> was added, {{as well as a}} new pedestrian walkway over the tracks of the Blue Line onto Bennington Street. The East Boston Greenway was recently connected to the beach by the creation of a multi-use path from Wood Island.|$|E
2500|$|The Majestic {{was about}} one third the {{capacity}} of the other Warner theater in Madison, the Capitol, and typically screened the Warner studio's lesser films or finished out the runs that opened at the larger theater. After the 1948 Supreme Court anti-trust ruling United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. that declared that studios must separate their film production from their exhibition, Warner Brothers spun off its theater holdings as Stanley-Warner Theaters (later RKO-Stanley-Warner Theaters). In 1956, the theater was once again extensively renovated, and re-opened with the movie musical High Society. The Majestic boasted [...] "ultra modern decorative effects" [...] with new seats, screen, <b>refreshment</b> <b>stand</b> and improved projection.|$|E
5000|$|The {{focus of}} the camp was the [...] "Greek Village" [...] which offered sights and sounds, food and {{entertainment}} from all over Greece. There was also a 20,000-seat amphitheatre, and <b>refreshment</b> <b>stands</b> and expositions all around camp.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>refreshments</b> <b>stand</b> {{features}} a themed bar, with the Blue Man Group [...] "specialty" [...] drink, Electric Blue Lemonade, {{which is available}} in alcoholic and non-alcoholic versions. The bar also features other mixed drinks, as well as snacks.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its live animal exhibits, the zoo houses <b>refreshments</b> <b>stands,</b> a dance hall, roads, walkways, and picnic grounds. Between 1920 and 1972, the Cincinnati Summer Opera performed in an open-air pavilion and were broadcast by NBC radio.|$|R
2500|$|Mont Alto Park {{became the}} first [...] "state forest park" [...] in Pennsylvania. The park had a {{swimming}} pool, <b>refreshment</b> <b>stand,</b> hiking trails and a carousel. It was also the site of South Mountain Camp Sanitorium. This sanitorium was founded by Dr. Joseph Rothrock, a medical doctor and forester who opened several sanitoriums in the forests of Pennsylvania and {{became known as the}} father of forestry in Pennsylvania. The sanitorium treated those afflicted with tuberculosis and other respiratory illnesses. Over the years the park has gradually become less and less of a destination for visitors. It is now a quiet park with minimal facilities. The building that housed the carousel, which now serves as a picnic pavilion, is a reminder of the past.|$|E
2500|$|The Architect criticised the {{internal}} decoration, {{much of which}} was by the theatrical scenery designer William Roxby Beverley, for being too restrained. Besides the circular corridor, Jermyn also designed a Moorish gate for the approach to the Globe's entrance. Four large galleries were later built between the loggias to surround {{the internal}} corridor {{and there was a}} <b>refreshment</b> <b>stand</b> to service the queues waiting to enter the globe. The building was about [...] square and the external walls about [...] high. The [...] domed roof was originally specified in zinc, but Wyld insisted on it being made in lead, which had added to the cost and complexity of the build. Wyld complained that the building had not been finished to a high standard: there were cracks in the plaster and brickwork, leaks from rain, and there were complaints about the smell from the blocked drains almost as soon as the attraction opened to the public.|$|E
2500|$|As {{they played}} on public parkland, the club could not charge {{admission}} fees for spectators, {{and while the}} number of spectators grew to a few thousands, it yielded no gate receipts. In 1888, the club rented a pitch at Asplins Farm next to the railway line at Northumberland Park at a cost of £17 per annum, where spectators may be charged 3d a game, raised to 6d for cup ties. The first match on the ground was on 13 October 1888, a reserve match that yielded gate receipts of 17 shillings. The first stand with just over 100 seats and changing rooms underneath was built on the ground for the 1894–95 season at a cost of £60, however, the stand was blown down a few weeks later and had to be repaired. In April 1898, 14,000 fans turned up to watch Spurs play Woolwich Arsenal. In the overcrowded ground, spectators climbed up onto the roof of the <b>refreshment</b> <b>stand,</b> which then collapsed causing a few injuries. [...] As Northumberland Park can no longer cope with the larger crowds, Spurs were forced to look for a larger ground and moved to the White Hart Lane site in 1899.|$|E

From 1959 to 1975, it was the flagship division of International Industries, a holding company which also owned the Orange Julius <b>refreshment</b> <b>stands.</b>|$|R
50|$|At its origin, Midway Park {{offered a}} {{baseball}} field, dance pavilion and dining hall, and a sandy beach for bathing. Today, the park uses the original picnic shelters with several more modern additions.

2500|$|When {{the club}} was first formed in 1882, the club played its matches on public land at the Park Lane end of Tottenham Marshes. As the ground was on public land, the club could not charge {{admission}} fees for spectators, and {{while the number of}} spectators grew to a few thousands within a few years, it yielded no gate receipts. In 1888, the club rented a pitch at Asplins Farm next to the railway line at Northumberland Park at a cost of £17 per annum, with the spectators charged 3d a game. [...] The first stand with just over 100 seats and changing rooms underneath was built on the ground for the 1894–95 season. Overcrowding at the ground however would become an issue; in 1898, during a match against Woolwich Arsenal attended by a record crowd of 15,000, the <b>refreshment</b> <b>stand</b> collapsed when fans climbed up onto its roof in the overcrowded ground, prompting the club to start looking for a new ground. In 1899, the club moved a short distance to a piece of land behind the White Hart pub, which would become the White Hart Lane ground.|$|E
2500|$|While Stewart ran the {{recording}} studio where the auditorium had been, Axton ran the Satellite record shop, which she established in the cinema's old foyer, where the <b>refreshment</b> <b>stand</b> had been. (The store later expanded next door into a vacated barber shop.) The Satellite store sold records {{from a wide variety}} of labels, which gave the Stax staff first-hand knowledge of what kind of music was selling—and was subsequently reflected in the music that Stax recorded. The store quickly became a popular hangout for local teenagers and was used to test-market potential Stax singles, as acetates of recently recorded Stax music were played to gauge customers' reactions. It also provided regular employment for many of the young hopefuls who later became part of Stax's musical family and provided cash flow in the early years while the label was struggling to establish itself. In his 2013 book Respect Yourself: Stax Records and the Soul Explosion, Robert Gordon highlighted the importance of Estelle Axton to the company. Often addressed as [...] "Miz Axton" [...] or [...] "Lady A.", she was respected by the Stax staff and performers and was regarded as a mother figure in the company. Although she had no formal training or experience in marketing, she had an unerring instinct for music and made many valuable suggestions to the young writers and musicians. Booker T. Jones described Estelle as [...] "an inspirer": ...|$|E

50|$|The Esplanade was {{originally}} dedicated as the Boston Embankment in 1910. The Embankment was created {{as part of}} the construction of the 1910 Charles River Dam Bridge (today the site of the Museum of Science). The parkland was criticized for its lack of shade trees, <b>refreshment</b> <b>stands,</b> recreation facilities, transportation utility, and visitors. It extended to Charlesgate (upstream of the Harvard Bridge) and connected with Frederick Law Olmsted's Emerald Necklace system of parks and open spaces. To address criticism, trees, a refreshment pavilion, and concerts were brought to the park.|$|R
