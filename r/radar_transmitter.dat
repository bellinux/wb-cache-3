In this case the <b>radar</b> <b>transmitter</b> must be a power-amplifier, e.g., a klystron tube or a solid state transmitter. In this way, the transmitted pulse is intrapulse-modulated and the radar receiver must use pulse compression techniques.|$|E
25|$|The first F-100D (54–2121) flew on 24 January 1956, piloted by Daniel Darnell. It entered {{service on}} 29 September 1956 with the 405th Fighter Wing at Langley AFB. The {{aircraft}} suffered from reliability {{problems with the}} constant speed drive which provides constant-frequency current to the electrical systems. In fact, the drive was so unreliable that the USAF required it {{to have its own}} oil system to minimize damage in case of failure. Landing gear and brake parachute malfunctions claimed a number of aircraft, and the refueling probes had a tendency to break away during high speed maneuvers. Numerous post-production fixes created such a diversity of capabilities between individual aircraft that, by 1965, around 700 F-100Ds underwent High Wire modifications to standardize the weapon systems. High Wire modifications took 60 days per aircraft at a cost for the entire project of US $150 million. In 1966, the Combat Skyspot program fitted some F-100Ds with an X band <b>radar</b> <b>transmitter</b> to allow for ground-directed bombing in inclement weather or at night.|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} blind bombing in Flagpole led to Grandy {{deciding}} {{to use the}} blind radar technique again. Hubbard was less sure. In 52 practice drops with blind radar, the average error had been [...] as opposed to [...] with visual bombing. The problem for the aircrew was {{that they would be}} dropping a live hydrogen bomb—generally considered a dangerous thing to do—with no means of verifying that their instruments were correct. Air Chief Marshal Sir Harry Broadhurst, the head of Bomber Command, wished O'Connor luck; his XD827 would make the drop, with Squadron Leader Tony Caillard in XD827, the grandstand aircraft. The aircraft took off at 07:15 on 11 September 1958. Once in the air, though, a fault developed in the ground <b>radar</b> <b>transmitter.</b> Grandy then authorised a visual drop.
