25|$|Weapons and Tactics Package (3 weeks) – Involves 5000-8000 rounds {{fired from}} the M4 carbine {{equipped}} with a Special Operations Peculiar Modification kit and the MEU(SOC) Pistol (.45 ACP). A live fire and maneuvering exercise in immediate action (IA) drills within close range of <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> <b>support,</b> as well as transportation, is conducted on the third week. As the Marines become familiar with their weapons, they conduct field exercise, force-on-force, live-fire drills using a militarized version of the Simunitions kit called the Special Effects Small Arms Marking Systems, or SESAMS. The Marking Cartridge ammunition contains a sabot and a small, plastic round encasing a colored detergent or paint, usually red or blue.|$|E
2500|$|The initial air {{component}} {{based in}} Borneo consisted of detachments from squadrons stationed in Malaya and Singapore. These included Twin Pioneer and Single Pioneer transport aircraft, probably {{two or three}} Blackburn Beverley and Handley Page Hastings transports, and about 12 helicopters of various types. One of Walker's first [...] "challenges" [...] was curtailing the RAF's centralised command and control arrangements and insisting that aircraft tasking for operations in Borneo was by his HQ, not by the RAF Air Command Far East HQ in Singapore. Other aircraft of many types stationed in Malaya and Singapore provided sorties as necessary, including routine transport support into Kuching and Labuan. <b>Rotary</b> <b>wing</b> <b>support</b> included 60 naval and air force troop-lift helicopters and another 40 smaller army variants.|$|E
50|$|On June 28, 2008, HMM-268 {{deployed}} to Naval Air Station Lemoore after California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger requested military assistance to fight raging wildfires.

50|$|On 27 August 1990, MALS-14 FWD {{deployed}} {{aboard the}} SS Wright to the Persian Gulf for Operation Desert Shield. The deployment's compliment of Marines included aircraft maintenance and supply specialists from several Marine Corps bases {{located on the}} east coast of the United States. After debarking the <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> <b>support</b> package in Saudi Arabia, the SS Wright berthed at the port in Manama, Bahrain where the balance of MALS-14 FWD provided support to Marine Corps squadrons stationed in that country.|$|E
50|$|In 1966, <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> <b>support</b> was {{originated}} {{as part of}} {{the response}} to the ongoing war in South Vietnam. Starting with Helicopter Combat Support Squadron ONE (HC-1), detachments of helicopter gunships transferred to the Navy to conduct combat operations in the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam. HC-1, the “Fleet Angels”, operated two-aircraft detachments of Army UH-1B gunships, staged from shore bases and patrol craft tenders. Providing a quick reaction, close air-support (CAS) role for units of the Navy's River Patrol Force (also known as the Brown-water Navy), the effectiveness of the helicopter attack mission was quickly realized.|$|E
5000|$|The Warhorses {{deployed}} three {{aircraft and}} 40 Marines to Naval Air Station Lemoore on July 2, 2008 after California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger requested military assistance to fight raging wildfires. The helicopters provided heavy lift <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> <b>support</b> to United States Northern Command and the National Fire Center. [...] After nearly two weeks, where they dropped more than 68,000 {{gallons of water}} on the Basin Complex Fire in Big Sur, the squadron's detachment of three helicopters and 30+ Marines was moved to McClellan Airfield near Sacramento to aid fire fighters with a 7000 acre wildfire burning in Mendocino County.|$|E

50|$|Operation Perth was an Australian {{military}} operation in Orūzgān Province undertaken in July 2006 during the War in Afghanistan. The nine-day search and destroy operation occurred {{as part of}} a wider multi-national coalition operation to clear the Chora Valley, 40 km north-east of Tarin Kowt, involving more than 500 troops from six nations, including the Netherlands Korps Commandotroepen. The operation was undertaken by the Australian Special Operations Task Group, including personnel from 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment and the Special Air Service Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Mark Smethurst. Fixed and <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> <b>support</b> was provided by a range of Coalition air assets, including Australian CH-47 Chinooks from the 5th Aviation Regiment. Heavy fighting with Taliban insurgents resulted, and during the intense combat the Australians fought their way through the valley, clearing it in a series of synchronised and closely coordinated operations. Despite meeting stiff resistance from several hundred insurgents, the operation was ultimately successful with the Taliban sustaining heavy casualties and eventually fleeing the valley.|$|E
2500|$|United States Air Force Combat Control Teams, {{singular}} Combat Controller (CCT) (AFSC 1C2X1), are American {{special operations}} forces (specifically known as [...] "special tactics operators") who specialize {{in all aspects of}} air-ground communication, including air traffic control, fire support (including fixed and <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> close air <b>support),</b> and command, control, and communications in covert, forward, or austere environments.|$|R
25|$|The Air Element is the {{air force}} branch of the PNGDF, {{operating}} {{a small number of}} light aircraft and <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> assets in <b>support</b> of army operations. Like the PNGDF in general {{the air force}} suffers from chronic equipment shortages and underfunding, but probably even more so than the other two branches. The role of the air force is to support army operations with transport, air re-supply and medical evacuation capabilities. The Defence White Paper 2013 included a new role to be developed of surveillance.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the U.S. Air Force as a separate service in 1947, the army began to develop further its own aviation assets (light planes and <b>rotary</b> <b>wing</b> aircraft) in <b>support</b> of ground operations. The Korean War gave this drive impetus, and the war in Vietnam saw its fruition, as army aviation units performed a variety of missions, including reconnaissance, transport, and fire support. After the war in Vietnam, the role of armed helicopters as tank destroyers received new emphasis. In recognition of the growing importance of aviation in army doctrine and operations, aviation became a separate branch on 12 April 1983.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A novel {{design in}} micro-air-vehicle using {{flapping}} <b>rotary</b> <b>wings</b> with different wing spanwise length and area is proposed. With the wings flapping, produced thrust makes the wings rotation. Furthermore, lift force from <b>rotary</b> <b>wings</b> increases and overcomes the MAV weight. On {{the basis of}} this principle, a mechanical model is made and sample experiments of averaged lift measurement in different wing length and area and angle of attack are executed. It is shown that the maximum averaged lift produced by micro flapping <b>rotary</b> <b>wings</b> can reach to 80 mN approximately close to the weight of MAV...|$|R
