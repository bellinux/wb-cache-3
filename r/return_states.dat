30|$|The revenue {{effect of}} a higher tax burden on the 80 th- 95 th percentiles is the {{opposite}} of the effect for the top 5 percent. The negative coefficient on the interaction term (Table  5, column 3, row 9) implies that the greater the decrease in AGI, the smaller the decrease (or the larger the increase) in revenue corresponding to a higher tax rate on the next 15 percent. Evaluated at the mean change in AGI for this group (-$ 5, 257 per <b>return),</b> <b>states</b> with higher tax burdens on the 80 th- 95 th percentiles had smaller decreases in tax revenue, or actual increases 30.

Major results based on the CSFB/Tremont hedge fund indexes monthly data during the period 1994 - 2012, highlight {{the importance of the}} long memory parameter magnitude i. e shocks in shaping hedge fund return dynamics and show that the hedge fund dynamics are characterized by two levels of persistence: in the first one, associated to low-volatility regime, hedge fund returns are a stationary long memory process whereas in the second one, associated to high-volatility regime, returns exhibit higher parameter of fractional integration. More precisely, in high volatility regime i. e periods of turmoil, the process tends to be non-stationary but still exhibits a mean-reverting behavior. The findings are interesting and enable us to establish a relationship between hedge fund <b>return</b> <b>states</b> and memory phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem of philosophy of nature is attended in this paper: {{is it possible}} for time to flow even if the changes that in fact go along with it did not exist? The two antique positions that are the most recognized, the one of Aristotle and the one of the stoics, are analized in this essay. On the one hand, Aristotle defines time based on change, so his answer to the question here addressed would be negative; but, on the other hand, the stoics argue that there exist moments in which time truly flows without there being changes, as the orthodox version of the Eternal <b>Return</b> <b>states,</b> and therefore time does not presupposes the notion of change. I here present the following hypothesis: the heterodox stoics accepted the aristotelian idea of time that presupposes change, an idea which they got to know from Eudemus, and that leads them to propose transcyclic changes in order to solve the problems generated by the discussion on individualization, identity and change through time...|$|E
40|$|In this poster we {{describe}} the tabling techniques for Sequential and Concurrent Horn Transaction Logic. Horn Transaction Logic {{is an extension of}} classical logic programming with state updates and it has a SLD-style evaluation algorithm. This SLD-style algorithm enters into infinite loops when computing answers to many recursive programs when they change the underlying state of the knowledge base. We solve this problem by tabling (caching) the calls, call states and answers (unifications and <b>return</b> <b>states)</b> in a searchable structure for the Sequential Transaction Logic, or building a graph for the query and memoize the "hot " vertices (vertices, currently, possible to execute) for the Propositional Concurrent Transaction Logic, so that the same call is not re-executed ad infinum. With these techniques, we can efficiently compute queries to transaction logic programs, and when the underlying programs have the bounded term-depth property (Transaction Datalog) the techniques are guaranteed to terminate. The applications of these techniques promise termination and great improvements in the uses of transaction logic: state-changing systems, artificial intelligence planning, dynamic constraints on transaction execution, workflow modeling and verification, and systems involving financial transactions...|$|E

40|$|A between {{subjects}} {{experimental design}} was constructed to measure decision makers 2 ̆ 7 reinvestment {{behavior in a}} sunk cost decision relative to an alternative choice and a reserve fund choice. The independent variables were responsibility, decision choice relative-risk, and decision return. The dependent variable was the amount reinvested to a sunk cost decision. Second order interactions of responsibility, relative-risk, and return were hypothesized. ^ Alternative relative-risks and expected returns were manipulated by responsibility to reflect the kinds of decision alternatives strategic decision makers face. As such, opportunity costs were built into the study, contrary to conventional escalate-or-withdraw designs. ^ Planned comparisons of responsibility/relative-risk reinvestment means were conducted at levels of decision return. These tests indicated that responsible and nonresponsible subjects alike took a conservative reinvestment posture when they faced a risky reinvestment versus a conservative alternative choice in a low <b>return</b> <b>state.</b> In a high <b>return</b> <b>state,</b> responsible subjects escalated commitment to the sunk cost when they compared both decisions as low risk versus both decisions as high risk. In a high <b>return</b> <b>state,</b> nonresponsible subjects de-escalated when making the same comparison, however. ^ In a low <b>return</b> <b>state</b> the comparison of low reinvestment risk/high alternative risk versus high reinvestment risk/low alternative risk decision choices yielded significant de-escalation by both responsible and nonresponsible subjects. ^ These interactive differences indicate that the collective impacts of responsibility and relative-risk are influenced by level of return. An interaction of responsibility, relative-risk, and return was therefore demonstrated by planned comparisons. ^ These results contradict prospect theory predictions which maintain that decision makers will be risk-seeking {{in the face of}} negative feedback. Contrarily, subjects predominantly took a conservative posture when they analyzed marginal gains and losses from the perspective of partial loss recovery or when they analyzed marginal gains and losses from the perspective of complete recovery with potential gains. These results suggest the future utility of approaching the escalation phenomenon from the perspective of risk-return perception. ...|$|R
