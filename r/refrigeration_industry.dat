25|$|The process spurred on the {{industry}} of gas manufacturing, and gasification plants were established quickly along the Eastern seaboard of the United States. Similar processes, like the Haber Process, led to the manufacture of ammonia (NH3) by the combining of nitrogen, found in air, with high volumes of hydrogen. This spurred on the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>industry</b> which long used ammonia as its refrigerant. Prof. Lowe also held several patents on artificial ice making machines, {{and was able to}} run successful businesses in cold storage as well as products which operated on hydrogen gas.|$|E
25|$|The {{measured}} {{capacity of}} refrigeration is always dimensioned in units of power. Domestic and commercial refrigerators may be rated in kJ/s, or Btu/h of cooling. For {{commercial and industrial}} refrigeration systems, {{most of the world}} uses the kilowatt (kW) as the basic unit of refrigeration. Typically, commercial and industrial refrigeration systems in North America are rated in tons of refrigeration (TR). Historically, one TR was defined as the energy removal rate that will freeze one short ton of water at 0°C (32°F) in one day. This was very important because many early refrigeration systems were in ice houses. The simple unit allowed owners of these early refrigeration systems to measure a day's output of ice against energy consumption, and to compare their plant to one down the street. While ice houses make up a much smaller part of the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>industry</b> than they once did, the unit TR has remained in North America. The unit's value as historically defined was approximately 11,958 Btu/hr (3.505kW), and has now been conventionally redefined as exactly 12,000 Btu/hr (3.517kW).|$|E

50|$|There is a {{trend in}} the HVAC and <b>refrigeration</b> <b>industries</b> to use {{brushless}} motors instead of various types of AC motors.

While shaded-pole and permanent split capacitor motors once dominated as the motor of fan, many fans are now run using a brushless motor. Some fans use brushless motors also in order to increase overall system efficiency.|$|R

50|$|The {{company began}} as York Manufacturing Company (YMC). YMC had 6 {{original}} investors, Stephen Morgan Smith, Jacob Loucks, Henry H. LaMotte, Oliver J. Bollinger, George Buck, and Robert Shetter. The company made {{a variety of}} products over the decades. Its early-era product line included steam engines, turbines, washing machines, and farm machinery. Its interests grew in commercial ice making plant and commercial refrigeration plant for food processing and commercial cold storage; these eventually developed into its main line of business from the 1890s through the 1920s. For example, it {{did a lot of}} dairy plant business, including ice cream plant, as well as air washing for large buildings (a form of dehumidification that presaged modern air conditioning). Its ice machinery was used in part as a new source of ice (besides ice cut in winter) for the large ice trade. In the late 1920s, York Machinery Company bought seven of its eight independent sales companies and three companies selling collateral equipment. The new, larger York was called the York Ice Machinery Corporation. In the 1920s and subsequently, the commercial business lines evolved with the gradual advent of widespread home refrigerators, freezers, and air conditioners—the consumerization of the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>industry,</b> which had earlier been only commercial and industrial. Thus York became a builder of major appliances and of refrigeration compressors for sale to other OEMs, and it became an important brand in what had now coalesced into the commercial and residential HVAC industry (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning combined into integrated systems). It provided massive air conditioning plant for skyscrapers {{all the way down to}} AC window units for a single room. In 1956, Borg-Warner purchased the company, making it the York Division of Borg-Warner. In 1986, York was spun off as an independent company, York International.|$|E
