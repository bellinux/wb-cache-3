5|$|In 1529 the Chuj city of San Mateo Ixtatán (then {{known by}} the name of Ystapalapán) was given in encomienda to the conquistador Gonzalo de Ovalle {{together}} with Santa Eulalia and Jacaltenango. In 1549, the first reduction of San Mateo Ixtatán took place, overseen by Dominican missionaries, in the same year the Q'anjob'al reducción settlement of Santa Eulalia was founded. Further Q'anjob'al reducciones were in place by 1560. Q'anjob'al resistance was largely passive, based on withdrawal to the inaccessible mountains and forests. In 1586 the Mercedarian Order built the first church in Santa Eulalia. The Chuj of San Mateo Ixtatán remained rebellious and resisted Spanish control for longer than their highland neighbours, <b>resistance</b> <b>that</b> was possible owing to their alliance with the lowland Lakandon Ch'ol to the north.|$|E
5|$|In 1809, Nicolls {{commanded}} HMS Standards marines {{while the}} ship {{participated in the}} Gunboat War. On 18 May Nicolls' marines assisted marines and seamen {{under the command of}} Captain William Selby of HMS Owen Glendower in the capture of the island of Anholt. In the skirmish, a Danish garrison of 170 men put up a sharp but ineffectual <b>resistance</b> <b>that</b> killed one British marine and wounded two before surrendering. Following the capture of Anholt, Nicolls was briefly assigned as the British military governor of the island. On 8 August 1810, Nicolls received the brevet rank of major.|$|E
5|$|In March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces {{won their}} first major victory at Taierzhuang {{but then the}} city of Xuzhou was taken by Japanese in May. In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by {{flooding}} the Yellow River; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at Wuhan, but the city was taken by October. Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese <b>resistance</b> <b>that</b> Japan had hoped to achieve; instead the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing and continued the war.|$|E

50|$|Age {{stereotypes}} are internalized {{starting in}} early childhood. This process of early internalization is {{facilitated by the}} lack of <b>resistances</b> <b>that</b> are usually present when stereotypes are relevant to the personal identity of those exposed to them. In North America and Europe, these stereotypes tend to be negative.|$|R
5|$|John {{returns to}} the Resistance {{headquarters}} located aboard a nuclear submarine and is briefed by General Ashdown (Ironside) that the Resistance has discovered a hidden signal containing a code protocol which they believe can initiate a permanent shutdown of Skynet's machines. Working on this intelligence, the human militia plans to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco. It is decided among the <b>Resistance</b> <b>that</b> the offensive will commence in four days, due to an intercepted kill-list created by Skynet, which plans to terminate the Resistance's command staff within the same time frame. John learns he is second on this list, following Kyle Reese (Yelchin). The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyle's importance, but John knows Kyle will eventually travel {{back in time and}} become his father, and realizes that Skynet has learned of this fact.|$|E
5|$|The {{resistor}} {{is perhaps}} the simplest of passive circuit elements: as its name suggests, it resists the current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. The resistance {{is a consequence of}} the motion of charge through a conductor: in metals, for example, resistance is primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions. Ohm's law is a basic law of circuit theory, stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a range of temperatures and currents; materials under these conditions are known as 'ohmic'. The ohm, the unit of resistance, was named in honour of Georg Ohm, and is symbolised by the Greek letter Ω. 1Ω is the <b>resistance</b> <b>that</b> will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the morning}} of 26 September, the Germans pressed home their attacks and finally linked up from both sides at the river. It was not until about noon that they {{realised}} the British had actually withdrawn. Later in the day, they rounded up about 600 men, mostly {{the men in the}} aid stations and those left on the north bank, as well as some pockets of <b>resistance</b> <b>that</b> had been out of radio contact with division Headquarters and did not know about the withdrawal.|$|E
50|$|Atomizer coils made of kanthal {{usually have}} <b>resistances</b> <b>that</b> vary from 0.4Ω (ohms) to 2.8Ω. Coils of lower ohms have {{increased}} vapor production but could risk fire and dangerous battery failures if the user is not knowledgeable enough about electrical principles {{and how they}} relate to battery safety.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about how {{variations}} in fungicide treatment affect the selection pressure to evolve <b>resistance</b> to <b>that</b> fungicide.

5|$|Due to poor intelligence, the British {{were told}} to expect only limited {{resistance}} from German reserve forces. A serious challenge to their operation was not expected and many men believed that their work {{would lead to the}} ending of the war. Some—anticipating a period of occupation in Germany—packed leisure equipment in their kit or in the sea tail. The optimistic mood prior to the operation would have tragic consequences however. Frederick Browning's intelligence officer—Major Brian Urquhart—obtained information from the 21st Army Group in Belgium and Dutch <b>resistance</b> <b>that</b> German armour was present around Arnhem. This was backed up with aerial reconnaissance that he ordered to be flown. Browning however was dismissive and ordered his chief medical officer to have Urquhart sent on sick leave. In fact, SHAEF was aware that there were almost certainly two Panzer divisions at Arnhem but with the operation looming chose to ignore them. Such information would have been gleaned from Ultra intercepts that the First Allied Airborne Army was not privy to and therefore could not act upon themselves.|$|E
5|$|In 1529 the Chuj city of San Mateo Ixtatán (then {{known by}} the name of Ystapalapán) was given in encomienda to the conquistador Gonzalo de Ovalle, a {{companion}} of Pedro de Alvarado, together with Santa Eulalia and Jacaltenango. In 1549, the first reduction (reducción in Spanish) of San Mateo Ixtatán took place, overseen by Dominican missionaries, in the same year the Q'anjob'al reducción settlement of Santa Eulalia was founded. Further Q'anjob'al reducciones were in place at San Pedro Soloma, San Juan Ixcoy and San Miguel Acatán by 1560. Q'anjob'al resistance was largely passive, based on withdrawal to the inaccessible mountains and forests from the Spanish reducciones. In 1586 the Mercedarian Order built the first church in Santa Eulalia. The Chuj of San Mateo Ixtatán remained rebellious and resisted Spanish control for longer than their highland neighbours, <b>resistance</b> <b>that</b> was possible owing to their alliance with the lowland Lakandon Ch'ol to the north. The continued resistance was so determined that the Chuj remained pacified only while the immediate effects of the Spanish expeditions lasted.|$|E
5|$|On the October 11, 2004 {{edition of}} Raw, La Résistance {{had to defend}} the World Tag Team Championship in a match with Eugene and William Regal. Regal hit Sylvain Grenier {{with a pair of}} brass {{knuckles}} and pinned him to win the World Tag Team title. Eric Bischoff, however, restarted the match. The match resulted in La Résistance retaining the title, after Robért Conway jabbed Regal in the side with a flagpole. Bischoff informed La <b>Résistance</b> <b>that</b> at Taboo Tuesday they were scheduled to defend the World Tag Team title against the two individuals who were not chosen to face Triple H for the World title. Shawn Michaels won the fans choice, which gave Edge and Chris Benoit a World Tag Team title match. Edge, however, abandoned Benoit during the match, which forced Benoit to wrestle both members of La Résistance by himself. Despite this, Benoit managed to force Conway to submit to the Crippler Crossface to win the World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

5|$|Set reveals to the <b>Resistance</b> <b>that</b> the Nazis' {{discovery}} {{of one of}} the Da'at Yichud caches, which included advanced technology centuries ahead of its time, is what allowed Germany to surpass the Allies in military might and ultimately win the war. Set agrees to assist the Resistance by revealing the location of one such cache, but states that the Resistance requires a U-boat to access it. Blazkowicz obtains a U-boat, but discovers that it is the flagship of the Nazis' submarine fleet, and is equipped with a cannon designed to fire nuclear warheads, which requires codes from the Nazi lunar research facility to operate. Blazkowicz uses the technology found in the Da'at Yichud cache, namely the Spindly Torque—a sphere that destroys the super-concrete—to steal the identity of a Nazi Lunar scientist and infiltrate the Lunar Base. He succeeds at obtaining the codes, but upon returning to earth, he discovers that Deathshead has mounted an assault on the Resistance base, capturing some of the members.|$|E
