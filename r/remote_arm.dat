His technical assignments have included software verification at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory and Flight Simulation Laboratory; vehicle and satellite integration at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, for STS-5, 6, 7, 8, and 9; Astronaut Office EVA (Extra-vehicular activity) expert; and Space Station construction, EVA maintenance, and design. Spring served as a mission specialist on STS-61-B which flew November 26, 1985 through December 3, 1985. During that mission {{he was responsible for}} launching three communications satellites and performed two EVAs. During the EVAs, which totaled more than 12 hours, Spring investigated Space Station construction techniques, large structure manipulation while {{on the end of the}} <b>remote</b> <b>arm,</b> and a time and motion study for comparison between Earth training and space performance, with the EASE/ACCESS experiment. With the completion of STS-61-B, he has logged a total of 165 hours in space. After the Space Shuttle Challenger accident, Spring participated in the Kennedy Space Center Tiger Team for accident investigation, then led the Astronaut Office EVA (Extra Vehicle Activity) program until 1988.|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} remote pacemaker interrogation for the earlier diagnosis of clinically actionable events compared with traditional transtelephonic monitoring and routine in-person evaluation. BackgroundPacemaker patient follow-up procedures have evolved from evaluating devices with little programmability and diagnostic information solely in person to transtelephonic rhythm strip recordings that allow monitoring of basic device function. More recently developed remote monitoring technology leverages expanded device capabilities, augmenting traditional transtelephonic monitoring to evaluate patients via full device interrogation. MethodsThe time to first diagnosis of a clinically actionable event was compared in patients who were followed by remote interrogation (Remote) and those who were followed per standard of care with office visits augmented by transtelephonic monitoring (Control). Patients were randomized 2 : 1. <b>Remote</b> <b>arm</b> patients transmitted pacemaker information at 3 -month intervals. Control arm patients with a single-chamber pacemaker transmitted at 2 -month intervals. Control arm patients with dual-chamber devices transmitted at 2 -month intervals with an office visit at 6 months. All patients were seen in office at 12 months. ResultsThe mean time to first diagnosis of clinically actionable events was earlier in the <b>Remote</b> <b>arm</b> (5. 7 months) than in the Control arm (7. 7 months). Three (2 %) of the 190 events in the Control arm and 446 (66 %) of 676 events in the <b>Remote</b> <b>arm</b> were identified remotely. ConclusionsThe strategic use of remote pacemaker interrogation follow-up detects actionable events that are potentially important more quickly and more frequently than transtelephonic rhythm strip recordings. The use of transtelephonic rhythm strips for pacemaker follow-up is of little value except for battery status determinations.

40|$|ObjectivesThe primary {{objective}} {{was to determine if}} wireless remote monitoring with automatic clinician alerts reduces the time from a clinical event to a clinical decision in response to arrhythmias, cardiovascular (CV) disease progression, and device issues compared to patients receiving standard in-office care. A secondary {{objective was to}} compare the rates of CV health care utilization between patients in the remote and in-office arms. BackgroundIn addition to providing life-saving therapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators collect advanced diagnostics on the progression of the patient's heart disease. Device technology has progressed to allow wireless remote monitoring with automatic clinician alerts to replace some scheduled in-office visits. MethodsThe CONNECT (Clinical Evaluation of Remote Notification to Reduce Time to Clinical Decision) study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized evaluation involving 1, 997 patients from 136 clinical sites who underwent insertion of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (including cardiac resynchronization therapy devices) and were followed up for 15 months. Health care utilization data included all CV-related hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and clinic office visits. ResultsThe median time from clinical event to clinical decision per patient was reduced from 22 days in the in-office arm to 4. 6 days in the <b>remote</b> <b>arm</b> (p < 0. 001). The health care utilization data revealed a decrease in mean length of stay per CV hospitalization visit from 4. 0 days in the in-office arm to 3. 3 days in the <b>remote</b> <b>arm</b> (p = 0. 002). ConclusionsWireless remote monitoring with automatic clinician alerts as compared with standard in-office follow-up significantly reduced the time to a clinical decision in response to clinical events and was associated with a significant reduction in mean length of CV hospital stay.

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the clinical efficacy and safety of remote monitoring in patients with heart failure implanted with a biventricular defibrillator (CRT-D) with advanced diagnostics. Methods and results: The MORE-CARE trial is an international, prospective, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Within 8 weeks of de novo implant of a CRT-D, patients were randomized to undergo remote checks alternating with in-office follow-ups (<b>Remote</b> <b>arm)</b> or in-office follow-ups alone (Standard arm). The primary endpoint was a composite of death and cardiovascular (CV) and device-related hospitalization. Use of healthcare resources was also evaluated. A total of 865 eligible patients (mean age 66 ± 10 years) were included in the final analysis (437 in the <b>Remote</b> <b>arm</b> and 428 in the Standard arm) and followed for a median of 24 (interquartile range = 15 – 26) months. No significant difference was found in the primary endpoint between the Remote and Standard arms [hazard ratio 1. 02, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 80 – 1. 30, P = 0. 89] or in the individual components of the primary endpoint (P > 0. 05). For the composite endpoint of healthcare resource utilization (i. e. 2 -year rates of CV hospitalizations, CV emergency department admissions, and CV in-office follow-ups), a significant 38 % reduction was found in the Remote vs. Standard arm (incidence rate ratio 0. 62, 95 % CI 0. 58 – 0. 66, P < 0. 001) mainly driven by a reduction of in-office visits. Conclusions: In heart failure patients implanted with a CRT-D, remote monitoring did not reduce mortality or risk of CV or device-related hospitalization. Use of healthcare resources was significantly reduced as a result of a marked reduction of in-office visits without compromising patient safety. Trial registration: NCT 00885677...|$|E

Reflexes were evoked while participants performed rhythmic stepping and arm swinging movement with both arms and the leg contralateral to stimulation (ARM&LEG), with just arm movement (ARM) and with just contralateral leg movement (LEG). Stimulation intensities were just below threshold for evoking early latency (, 80 ms to peak) reflexes.

40|$|Microtektites, small blobs of ejecta {{formed in}} the shock melt and vapor plume of an impact, can be {{dispersed}} far from the source crater only if the impact is violent enough for the ejecta plume to pierce the atmosphere; they are therefore formed in far smaller (and more numerous) impact events on Mars than on Venus and Earth, which have thicker atmospheres. Microtektite abundances from the Chicxulub and Bosumtwi craters on Earth suggest that the volume of this material is ∼ 5 × 10 − 5 D 3. 74 c km 3, with Dc the crater diameter in kilometers, similar to the observed volumes of the dark parabolic ejecta deposits on Venus. Corresponding volumes on Mars are ∼ 2. 5 × smaller, but even so this result implies that even only a 15 -km crater can produce a layer of microtektites with a global average thickness on Mars of 40 microtektites per square centimeter.

The seriousness of the orbital debris problem is briefly described. Available 'solutions' are outlined from the literature. The engineering design is briefly mentioned, with an emphasis on the positive aspects of the space environment that should be used in an economical approach. The aspects of operating in microgravity, vacuum, and in utilizing solar energy are mentioned. A quantitative computer animation was developed to provide design data.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} work, {{a methodology}} is proposed to enable a robot to identify an object to be grasped and its intended grasp configuration while a human is teleoperating a robot towards the desired object. Based on the detected object and grasp configuration, the human is {{assisted in the}} teleoperation task. The environment is unstructured and consists {{of a number of}} objects, each with various possible grasp configurations. The identification of the object and the grasp configuration is carried out in real time, by recognizing the intention of the human motion. Simultaneously, the human user is assisted to preshape over the desired grasp configuration. This is done by scaling the components of the <b>remote</b> <b>arm</b> end-effector motion that lead to the desired grasp configuration and simultaneously attenuating the components that are in perpendicular directions. The complete process occurs while manipulating the master device and without having to interact with another interface. Intention recognition from motion is carried out by using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) theory. First, the objects are classified based on their shapes. Then, the grasp configurations are preselected for each object class. The selection of grasp configurations is based on the human knowledge of robust grasps for the various shapes. Next, an HMM for each object class is trained by having a skilled teleoperator perform repeated preshape trials over each grasp configuration of the object class in consideration. The grasp configurations are modeled as the states of each HMM whereas the projections of translation and orientation vectors, over each reference vector, are modeled as observations. The reference vectors are the ideal translation and rotation trajectories that lead the <b>remote</b> <b>arm</b> end-effector towards a grasp configuration. During an actual grasping task performed by a novice or a skilled user, the trained model is used to detect their intention. The output probability of the HMM associated with each object in the environment is computed as the user is teleoperating towards the desired object. The object that is associated with the HMM which has the highest output probability, is taken as the desired object. The most likely Viterbi state sequence of the selected HMM gives the desired grasp configuration. Since an HMM is associated with every object, objects can be shuffled around, added or removed from the environment without the need to retrain the models. In other words, the HMM for each object class needs to be trained only once by a skilled teleoperator. The intention recognition algorithm was validated by having novice users, as well as the skilled teleoperator, grasp objects with different grasp configurations from a dishwasher rack. Each object had various possible grasp configurations. The proposed algorithm was able to successfully detect the operator 2 ̆ 7 s intention and identify the object and the grasp configuration of interest. This methodology of grasping was also compared with unassisted mode and maximum-projection mode. In the unassisted mode, the operator teleoperated the arm without any assistance or intention recognition. In the maximum-projection mode, the maximum projection of the motion vectors was used to determine the intended object and the grasp configuration of interest. Six healthy and one wheelchair-bound individuals, each executed twelve pick-and-place trials in intention-based assisted mode and unassisted mode. In these trials, they picked up utensils from the dishwasher and laid them on a table located next to it. The relative positions and orientations of the utensils were changed {{at the end of every}} third trial. It was observed that the subjects were able to pick-and-place the objects 51...|$|E
40|$|The {{effort in}} this work has been to innovatively use range {{information}} from a laser sensor mounted on the end effector of a remote robotic arm in a telerobotic system to assist the user in carrying out remote tasks in unstructured environments. Assistance is provided {{in the form of}} Traded Supervisory Control where the human is involved in high level activities such as decision making and the machine generates task plans and executes tasks autonomously using laser data and machine intelligence. In this way human planning and high level decision making capabilities are combined with machine computational and precision task execution capabilities in an optimal way. Laser range data has been used in a novel way to generate trajectories and virtual constraints that assist the user either by executing trajectories autonomously or by guiding the user in teleoperation along specific virtual constraints. The ability of the laser to generate path plans and execute them autonomously, and generate 3 D geometry information is another novel feature of the project. This has been achieved without using sophisticated sensory suite and extensive computer processing. The user simply points to certain locations in the unstructured environment by teleoperating the <b>remote</b> <b>arm</b> using the master arm and presses certain keys on the keyboard. The machine using laser data and its intelligence generates the appropriate trajectories, virtual geometric surfaces and path plans which assist the user in executing the task. Time and accuracy results in executing a remote manipulation tasks on a real-time telerobotic system with master and slave arms, with and without laser based assistance have been generated and compared to validate the hypothesis that laser based assistance improves task performance and reduces the cognitive load on the user.
