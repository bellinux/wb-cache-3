Effective measures of controlling NOx emissions are necessary. In this study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, Ansys Fluent 14. 5, {{has been applied to}} research the processes of South American coal (SAm) <b>reburning</b> and cornstalk <b>reburning.</b> The influences of reburn zone excess air coefficient, <b>reburning</b> fuel fraction (Rff) and the secondary air temperature on the furnace combustion and NOx reduction have been determined. Results show that, in the simulated data range, the lower reburn zone excess air coefficient, the greater the rate of denitration for both SAm <b>reburning</b> and cornstalk <b>reburning.</b> The highest rates of denitration for SAm <b>reburning</b> and cornstalk <b>reburning</b> were 56. 15 % and 66. 89 %, respectively, in comparison to the conventional combustion. The denitration rate increases with the increase of <b>reburning</b> fuel fraction. However, when the <b>reburning</b> fuel fraction increases beyond a certain level, fuels within the furnace will undergo incomplete combustion. Under the premise of the fuel burnout, a relatively good case occurs at the <b>reburning</b> fuel fraction of 20 % for the two kinds of <b>reburning,</b> and the NOx removal rate is 60. 57 % for cornstalk <b>reburning,</b> which is 7. 61 % higher than that of the SAm <b>reburning.</b> Temperature also has certain influences on the denitration effect and it shows that, in the lower temperature range, the higher the temperature of the secondary air, the higher the denitration rate. However, as temperature reaches a certain value, the denitration effect is no longer enhanced but reduced. For the two kinds of <b>reburning,</b> the case with the secondary air at 500 K is a relatively good one, and the NOx removal rate reaches 66. 36 % for cornstalk <b>reburning,</b> while it is 55 % for SAm <b>reburning.</b> Overall, cornstalk <b>reburning</b> provides a higher NOx reduction rate in comparison to SAm <b>reburning...</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program has}} been completed to make detailed measurements of a pulverized coal flame with <b>reburning</b> and advanced <b>reburning.</b> Maps of species (CO, CO{sub 2 }, O{sub 2 }, NO, HCN, and NH{sub 3 }), temperature and velocity have been obtained which consist of approximately 60 measurements across a cross sectional plane of the reactor. A total of six of these maps have been obtained. Three operating conditions for the baseline flame have been mapped, two operating conditions with <b>reburning,</b> and one operating condition of advanced <b>reburning.</b> In addition to the mapping data, effluent measurements of gaseous products were obtained for various operating conditions. This report focuses on the advanced <b>reburning</b> data. Advanced <b>reburning</b> was achieved in the reactor by injecting natural gas downstream of the primary combustion zone to form a <b>reburning</b> zone followed by a second injection of ammonia downstream of <b>reburning</b> to form an advanced <b>reburning</b> zone. Finally, downstream of the ammonia injection, air was injected to form a burnout or tertiary air zone. The amount of natural gas injected was characterized by the <b>reburning</b> zone stoichiometric ratio. The amount of ammonia injected was characterized by the ammonia to nitrogen stoichiometric ratio or NSR and {{by the amount of}} carrier gas used to transport and mix the ammonia. A matrix of operating conditions where injector position, <b>reburning</b> zone stoichiometric ratio, NSR, and carrier gas flow rate were varied and NO reduction was measured was completed in addition to a map of data at one operating condition. The data showed advanced <b>reburning</b> was more effective than either <b>reburning</b> or NH{sub 3 } injection alone. At one advanced <b>reburning</b> condition over 95 % NO reduction was obtained. Ammonia injection was most beneficial when following a <b>reburning</b> zone which was slightly lean, S. R. = 1. 05, but was not very effective when following a slightly rich <b>reburning</b> zone, S. R. of 0. 95. In the cases where advanced <b>reburning</b> was most effective (<b>reburning</b> S. R. = 1. 05), higher NSR values improved NO reduction but NSR was secondary to NH{sub 3 } injector location. The optimal location for injection was found to coincide with changes in the temperature field. The mapped temperature, species and velocity data for advanced <b>reburning</b> showed that the largest drops in NO occurred in a region where the O{sub 2 } concentration was between 0. 7 and 3. 0 %, NH{sub 3 } was between 0 and 2961 ppm, and temperatures were between 1274 and 1343 K. These are similar to optimal conditions known for SNCR. Significant NO reductions were seen when NSR values were near one, suggesting NH{sub 3 } was very effective at NO reduction when surrounding temperature and species conditions were favorable. Because this was only one detailed set of data, it is difficult to conclude that these conditions are optimal or need to exist for optimal NO reduction. More detailed mapping data at other operating conditions would be useful in identifying optimal advanced <b>reburning</b> conditions...|$|E

Department of Agriculture, and a closely coordinated project sponsored by the DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL, formerly FETC). The overall Phase II objective of the SBIR project is to experimentally optimize the biomass <b>reburning</b> technologies and conduct engineering design studies needed for process demonstration at full scale. The DOE project addresses supporting issues for the process design including modeling activities, economic studies of biomass handling, and experimental evaluation of slagging and fouling. The performance of biomass has been examined in a 300 kW (1 x 10 {sup 6 } Btu/hr) Boiler Simulator Facility under different experimental conditions. Fuels under investigation include furniture waste, willow wood and walnut shells. Tests showed that furniture pellets and walnut shells provided similar NO{sub x} control as that of natural gas in basic <b>reburning</b> at low heat inputs. Maximum NO{sub x} reduction achieved with walnut shell and furniture pellets was 65 % and 58 % respectively. Willow wood provided a maximum NO{sub x} reduction of 50 % and was no better than natural gas at any condition tested. The efficiency of biomass increases when N-agent is injected into <b>reburning</b> and/or burnout zones, or along with OFA (Advanced <b>Reburning).</b> Co-injection of Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } with N-agent further increases efficiency of NO{sub x} reduction. Maximum NO{sub x} reduction achieved with furniture pellets and willow wood in Advanced <b>Reburning</b> was 83 % and 78 % respectively. All combustion experiments of the Phase II project have been completed. All objectives of the experimental tasks were successfully met. The kinetic model of biomass <b>reburning</b> has been developed. Model agrees with experimental data {{for a wide range}} of initial conditions and thus correctly represents main features of the <b>reburning</b> process. Modeling suggests that the most important factors that provide high efficiency of biomass in <b>reburning</b> are low fuel-N content and high content of alkali metals in ash. These results indicate that the efficiency of biomass as a <b>reburning</b> fuel may be predicted based on its ultimate, proximate, and ash analyses. The results of experimental and kinetic modeling studies were utilized in applying a validated methodology for <b>reburning</b> system design to biomass <b>reburning</b> in a typical coal-fired boiler. Based on the trends in biomass <b>reburning</b> performance and the characteristics of the boiler under study, a preliminary process design for biomass <b>reburning</b> was developed.

40|$|<b>Reburning</b> is {{examined}} {{as a means}} of NOₓ destruction in a 17 kW down-fired pulverized coal combustor. In <b>reburning,</b> a secondary fuel is introduced downstream of the primary flame to produce a reducing zone, favorable to NO destruction, and air is introduced further downstream to complete the combustion. Emphasis is on natural gas <b>reburning</b> and a bituminous coal primary flame. A parametric examination of <b>reburning</b> employing a statistical experimental design, is conducted, complemented by detailed experiments. Mechanisms governing the inter-conversion of nitrogenous species in the fuel rich reburn zone are explored. The effect of <b>reburning</b> on N₂O emissions, the effect of primary flame mode (premixed and diffusion) and the effect of distributing the <b>reburning</b> fuel, are also investigated. The parametric study allowed the effects of significant <b>reburning</b> variables to be identified and examined, but these effects could not be quantified. Detailed experiments identified optimum reburn zone stoichiometry between 0. 8 and 0. 9, depending on mixing in the reburn zone. Overall NO reductions, as high as 80 %, were possible and depended mainly on reburn zone variables, namely, temperature, residence time and stoichiometry. Exhaust N₂O emissions increased after air addition in the final stage of <b>reburning,</b> but were less than 10 ppm. Lower reductions in NO emissions were obtained when the primary flame was of the diffusion type, rather than of the premixed type, but final NO emissions below 250 ppm (dry, 0 % O₂) were still possible. <b>Reburning</b> fuel introduction in multiple streams did not enhance NO destruction, relative to single stream injections. Within the reburn zone, <b>reburning</b> mechanisms occurred in two regimes. One regime was {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>reburning</b> fuel flame and was distinguished by fast reactions between NO and hydrocarbons that were limited by mixing. The other regime covered the remainder of the reburn zone and was distinguished by slower reactions, without mixing complications. For the latter regime, a simplified model based on detailed gas phase chemical kinetic mechanisms and known rate coefficients was able to predict temporal profiles of NO, HCN and NH₃. Reactions involving hydrocarbons played important roles in both regimes and N₂ fixation by hydrocarbons limited <b>reburning</b> effectiveness at low primary NO values.

The data were analyzed by means of a combustion model, which included {{a detailed description of the}} <b>reburning</b> chemistry. The importance of several combustion parameters on the <b>reburning</b> efficiency was studied: inlet oxygen concentration, flue gas recycle ratio, temperature, and stoichiometric ratio. The inlet oxygen concentration was kept between 25 and 37 vol % and the burner stoichiometric ratio between 0. 7 and 1. 15. NO was injected in the oxidizer. As expected, similar to air-firing, <b>reburning</b> in oxy-fuel is favored by substoichiometric conditions. A decrease in combustion temperature, caused by a lowered stoichiometric ratio, is shown to be advantageous for reduction of NO under oxy-fuel conditions. The effect of inlet oxygen concentration on <b>reburning</b> is not significant as long as the combustion conditions are fuel-lean. However, the amount of recycled flue gas, which increases with decreasing oxygen content, significantly improves the total reduction. Instead, when the stoichiometric ratio is decreased, the recycle flow of the flue gas is reduced, which, to some extent, counteracts the otherwise positive effect of fuel-rich conditions in the flame zone in oxy-fuel conditions. Thus, during oxygen-rich combustion, the total <b>reburning</b> efficiency in oxy-fuel combustion is superior to once-through <b>reburning</b> in air-firing, but during substoichiometric conditions, the reduction in air and oxy-fuel combustion is comparable...|$|E

The SGAR systems include six AR variants: (1) AR-Lean [...] injection of the N-agent and promoter along with overfire air; (2) AR-Rich [...] injection of N-agent and promoter into the <b>reburning</b> zone; (3) Multiple Injection Advanced <b>Reburning</b> (MIAR) [...] injection of N-agents and promoters both into the <b>reburning</b> zone and with overfire air; (4) AR-Lean + Promoted SNCR [...] injection of N-agents and promoters with overfire air and into the temperature zone at which Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) is effective; (5) AR-Rich + Promoted SNCR [...] injection of N-agents and promoters into the <b>reburning</b> zone and into the SNCR zone; and (6) Promoted <b>Reburning</b> + Promoted SNCR [...] basic or promoted <b>reburning</b> followed by basic or promoted SNCR process. The project was conducted in two phases over a five-year period. The work included a combination of analytical and experimental studies to confirm the process mechanisms, identify optimum process configurations, and develop a design methodology for full-scale applications. Phase I was conducted from October, 1995 to September, 1997 and included both analytical studies and tests in bench and pilot-scale test rigs. Phase I moved AR technology to Maturity Level III-Major Subsystems. Phase II is conducted over a 45 month period (October, 1997 -June, 2001). Phase II included evaluation of alternative promoters, development of alternative <b>reburning</b> fuel and N-Agent jet mixing systems, and scale up. The goal of Phase II was to move the technology to Maturity Level I-Subscale Integrated System. Tests in combustion facility ranging in firing rate from 0. 1 x 10 {sup 6 } to 10 x 10 {sup 6 } Btu/hr demonstrated {{the viability of the}} AR technology. The performance goals of the project to reduce NO{sub x} by up to 95 % with net emissions less than 0. 06 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu and to minimize other pollutants (N{sub 2 }O and NH{sub 3 }) to levels lower than <b>reburning</b> and SNCR have been met. Experimental data demonstrated that AR-Lean + SNCR and <b>Reburning</b> + SNCR are the most effective AR configurations, followed by AR-Lean and AR-Rich. Promoters can increase AR NO{sub x} reduction efficiency. Promoters are the most effective at small amounts of the <b>reburning</b> fuel (6 - 10 % of the total fuel heat input). Promoters provide the means to improve NO{sub x} reduction and simultaneously decrease the amount of <b>reburning</b> fuel. Tests also showed that alkali-containing compounds are effective promoters of the AR process. When co-injected with N-agent, they provide up to 25 % improvement in NO{sub x} reduction. A detailed reaction mechanism and simplified representation of mixing were used in modeling of AR processes. Modeling results demonstrated that the model correctly described a wide range of experimental data. Mixing and thermal parameters in the model can be adjusted depending on characteristics of the combustion facility. Application of the model to the optimization of AR-Lean has been demonstrated. Economic analysis demonstrated a considerable economic advantage of AR technologies in comparison with existing commercial NO{sub x} control techniques, such as basic <b>reburning,</b> SNCR, and SCR. Particularly for deep NO{sub x} control, coal-based AR technologies are 50 % less expansive than SCR for the same level of NO{sub x} control. The market for AR technologies is estimated to be above $ 110 million...|$|E

40|$|The {{regulations}} {{established by}} the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 in the United States mean that a single NO{sub x} control technology {{is not likely to}} be sufficient for boilers in the ozone non-attainment areas. <b>Reburning</b> is an emerging three-stage combustion technology designed for the reduction of NO by introducing a small amount of <b>reburning</b> fuel above the primary flame where the majority of NO is chemically reduced to nitrogen. While coal, in general, has not been considered an effective <b>reburning</b> fuel, our recent research suggested that lignite has a <b>reburning</b> efficiency even higher than that of methane. The objectives of this research are to investigate (1) the relative importance of heterogeneous and homogeneous phase reactions, and (2) the role of CaO in the catalysis of char gasification by NO in <b>reburning</b> environment. Experiments have been performed with a flow reactor with a simulated flue gas at a stoichiometric ratio (SR). <b>Reburning</b> fuels in this study include methane, Pittsburgh No. 8 bituminous coal, Mississippi lignite, North Dakota lignite, chars derived from the coal and lignites, and the bituminous coal char impregnated with Can.

40|$|<b>Reburning</b> is {{a mature}} fuel staging NO{sub x} control {{technology}} {{which has been}} successfully demonstrated at full scale by Energy and Environmental Research Corporation (EER) and others on numerous occasions. Based on chemical kinetic modeling and experimental combustion studies, EER is currently developing novel concepts to improve {{the efficiency of the}} basic gas <b>reburning</b> process and to utilize various renewable and waste fuels for NO{sub x} control. This project is designed to develop engineering and modeling tools for a family of NO{sub x} control technologies utilizing biomass as a <b>reburning</b> fuel. Basic and advanced biomass <b>reburning</b> have the potential to achieve 60 - 90 +% NO{sub x} control in coal fired boilers at a significantly lower cost than SCR. The scope of work includes modeling studies (kinetic, CFD, and physical modeling), experimental evaluation of slagging and fouling associated with biomass <b>reburning,</b> and economic study of biomass handling requirements.

40|$|Fuel <b>reburning</b> and {{advanced}} <b>reburning</b> techniques {{are used to}} reduce NOx emissions from boilers. <b>Reburning</b> in some biomass fueled boilers is already practiced using natural gas as the <b>reburning</b> fuel. Gasification of biomass offers another means of implementing <b>reburning</b> in NOx control strategies for biomass fueled Rankine cycle power plants and similar concepts [1]. Siting the gasifier directly adjacent to the boiler in a close-coupled mode eliminates any need for gas cleaning prior to firing the product gas to the boiler. The close-coupled gasifier also allows fuels {{that are difficult to}} burn directly in the boiler to be used for power generation where they might not otherwise be used. High fouling and slagging fuels, such as cereal straws, other agricultural biomass, sludges, {{and a number of other}} materials, can be fired to the gasifier rather than directly to the boiler. The gasifier, operating at lower temperature and with a different reaction environment, can be employed to control the concentrations of alkali and other undesirable elements entering the boiler. The product gas from the gasifier is generally more readily fired to the boiler than are solid fuels. Ammonia in the producer gas and small amounts of alkali carrying over with the gas may promote the <b>reburning</b> reactions and increase the destruction of NOx. The feasibility is currently being investigated of close-coupled gasifier systems using selecte...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Reburning</b> {{technology}} has been developed to adopt various commercial combustion systems. Fuel lean <b>reburning</b> is an advanced <b>reburning</b> method to reduce NOx economically without using burnout air, however {{it is not easy}} to get high NOx reduction efficiency. In the fuel lean <b>reburning</b> system, the localized fuel rich eddies are used to establish partial fuel rich regions so that the NOx can react with hydrocarbon radical restrictively. In this paper, a new advanced <b>reburning</b> method which supplies reburn fuel with oscillatory motion is introduced to increase NOx reduction rate effectively. To clarify whether forced oscillating injection of reburn fuel can effectively reduce NOx emission, experimental tests were conducted in vertical combustion furnace. Experiments were performed in flames stabilized by a gas burner. The natural gas is used as both main and reburn fuel and total thermal input is about 40 kW. The forced oscillating injection of reburn fuel is realized by electronic solenoid valve, so that fuel rich region and fuel lean region is established alternately. In the fuel rich region, NOx is converted to N 2 by <b>reburning</b> reaction, however unburned hydrocarbon and CO is oxidized in fuel lean zone and mixing zone at downstream where slightly fuel lean region is formed by mixing of two regions. The NOx reduction rate increases up to 41 % by forced oscillating reburn motion. And this paper makes clear that in order to decrease NOx when oscillating reburn fuel injection system is adopted, the control of factors such as frequency and duty ratio is very important...|$|E
