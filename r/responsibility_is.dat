5|$|A defenseman is {{a player}} {{position}} whose <b>responsibility</b> <b>is</b> {{to assist the}} goalkeeper in preventing the opposing team from scoring. Each team fields three defensemen. These players generally remain on the defensive half of the field. Unless a defenseman gets the ball and chooses to run up the field and try to score or pass, by doing this {{they will need to}} cross the midfield line and signal one midfielder to stay back. A defensemen carries a long crosse which provides an advantage in reach for intercepting passes and checking.|$|E

5|$|A {{forward is}} a player {{position}} on the field whose <b>responsibility</b> <b>is</b> primarily offensive. Typically, a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other, and will primarily play {{on that side of}} the floor. Some players, known as creasemen, do not focus on one side or the other. These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender.|$|E
5|$|If the {{designated}} hitter (DH) rule is in effect, each {{team has a}} tenth player whose sole <b>responsibility</b> <b>is</b> to bat (and run). The DH {{takes the place of}} another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.|$|E

5|$|The {{courts have}} rarely treated {{content-based}} regulation of journalism with any sympathy. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974), the Court unanimously {{struck down a}} state law requiring newspapers criticizing political candidates to publish their responses. The state claimed that the law had been passed to ensure journalistic responsibility. The Supreme Court found that freedom, but not <b>responsibility,</b> <b>is</b> mandated by the First Amendment and so it ruled that the government may not force newspapers to publish that which they do not desire to publish.|$|E
5|$|In {{its current}} role No.79 Squadron's main <b>responsibility</b> <b>is</b> to provide {{introductory}} fast jet training to pilots who have recently graduated from No.2 Flying Training School.

5|$|Thus {{our actions}} are predetermined, and are causally {{related to the}} {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains our own. The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on the nature of things and the character of the agent. Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of our wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will is our own, no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human <b>responsibility</b> <b>is</b> known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E
