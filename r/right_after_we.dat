I felt a need to get a steady job and go in a career direction so that I could settle down and get married to my then girlfriend, now fiancee (soon to be wife in june :)). It was very interesting, something that I had been SO passionate about for YEARS was all of a sudden gone, normally a good sign when a persons calling has been directed elsewhere. After lots and lots of prayer I made the decision to leave WS following our tour with Sworn Enemy that ended in August of 05. The rest of the band planned to move on ward, but along with not really finding the right guy to fit my spot and some creative differences they decided to split. I know both Duke (drums) and Nate (bass) really felt like they needed to head back to school (as did I) and pursue their masters degrees..which is what I am currently doing as well. Peter and Caleb were going to keep WS going, but some logistics got cloudy and it just kinda fell away...culminating in Ghost of a Fallen Age being founded by Caleb. Caleb is really the only member doing full time music now, Peter still tours with Haste the Day as a merch guy (which is how we met him to begin with).The bottom line, so to speak, was that the majority of us were around the 25- and 26-year-old range. that may sound young, but in the game of music...if yo're not between 18-22...then you had better be making a for-real living, which we were not. we made enough to pay minimal bills, but after that..it was just enough to keep us going to the next show. music is a young mans game.In the end though we all still love music, metal in particular (except i think duke who is kind of soured on it), and our lives are going well.

40|$|Abstract only availableAlzheimer's disease (AD) {{took the}} life of my grandfather. It is {{believed}} that oxidative stress contributes to the progression of this disease. Studies in Dr. Sun's laboratory recognized NADPH oxidase as possible source for production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can damage cells in the brain. If this were true then something could be found to stop the activation of NADPH oxidase. This would stop the deterioration of cells, decreasing the amount of Alzheimer's cases. To do my part of this research, we culture immortalized astrocytes (DITNC) and look at how cells react to menadione, a compound that produces ROS, possible through activating NADPH oxidase. We will then see how apocynin stands up against menadione. To test this we had six wells containing the astrocytes. In the first two wells we didn't add anything to the cells, these were our control cells. In the other four wells we added menadione, and then in two of those wells we added apocynin. We then took pictures <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>we</b> added the inhibitor, 30 minutes after {{they were in the}} incubator, 60 minutes, and then 120 minutes later. Doing this allowed us to see the difference in adding apocynin and not adding it. Looking at our results, we found the wells with only Menadione had more cells that were dead and shriveled up, and there were fewer dying cells in the wells containing Apocynin. This means it is possible for Apocynin to be used to stop the activation of NADPH oxidase; this would keep cells from dying.

A investigação também sugere o cruzamento de fatores familiares e escolares na produção da indisciplina, pois existiria uma descontinuidade entre a ação formativa da família e as práticas pedagógicas da escolaThis {{dissertation}} is {{an inquiry}} into the meanings referring to school indiscipline, made {{by a group of}} students, teachers and coordinators of a private and non-denominational school located in the city of Ponta Grossa, PR. School indiscipline is a complex phenomenon and one of the biggest pedagogical obstacles, which is able to damage the teaching-learning process and weaken the teacher-student relationship. Having as its objective to comprehend the meanings of indiscipline, made by that group of people, we have developed an inquiry that explores, in its theoretical frame of reference, a set of concepts thought out by Basil Bernstein. On the field research we have used the qualitative way of proceeding. The selection of the interviewed people followed the criterion of intentional sampling by maximum variation. Coordinators, teachers and students that participated in this research were divided into two groups. The first one, formed by those who recently joined the school, while the second was formed by those who were already at the school for a long time. As a method of analysis of the information, we chose the form of analysis of content from which the following categories for interpreting indiscipline have been derived: a) lack of socio-affective structures; b) disengagement with the environment of collective learning system; c) nullification of the teaching-learning process; d) result of the provisional teaching staff; e) reflection of the deficiency of the formative role performed by the family. The text is structured in the following way. First of all, we study some concepts created by Basil Bernstein in his theoretical studies. Then, we approach the building up of indiscipline in schools, arguing the concept of indiscipline under the light of the reflection of a group of theoreticians about it. <b>Right</b> <b>after,</b> <b>we</b> show some characteristics of the empirical research, of the sampling which was used and of the context which was been studied. Next we develop the analysis of the content of the interviews and in the last section we present the final considerations. This research offers us a series of readings about school indiscipline, which may make clear some of its possible meanings. We gave special emphasis to the notion of the indiscipline as the lack of socio-affective structures in the students. Moreover, it would also be a reflection of the provisional teaching staff, as well {{as a consequence of the}} nullification of the teaching-learning process. This inquiry also suggests that there is a crossing between family aspects and school aspects in the production of indiscipline, that is to say that there would be a discontinuity between the formative action of the family and the pedagogical practices of the schoo...|$|E
