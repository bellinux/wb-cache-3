40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Two {{organophosphates}} (<b>Ruelene</b> and Tiguvon) and two carbamates (Sevin and Baygon) {{were administered}} topically at various sublethal concentrations to cricket eggs. All the pesticides caused an immediate {{decrease in the}} acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity level in the embryo, but the level usually returned to normal within three days after dosage. The pesticides {{were found to be}} competitive inhibitors of AChE. When applied before the AChE was present, the pesticides caused a depression of AChE when it first appeared. Nymphs were more susceptible than eggs to all the pesticides tested, except <b>Ruelene.</b> Penetration through the chorion was never more than 10...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 <b>Ruelene</b> was orally {{administered}} to three female sheep at a dosage rate of 121. 5 mg /kg. The cholinesterase (ChE) activity levels of blood plasma, {{red blood cells}} (RBC), and mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) which had fed on the sheep were tested at various times before and after dosage. Maximum depression of the sheep blood ChE activity occurred at the fourth hour after dosage, while the major depression of mosquito ChE activity occurred at the fifth hour. Mosquito death occurred first {{at an average of}} 35...|$|E
40|$|Details of {{chemotherapeutic}} and chemoprophylactic trials with systemic organic phosphorus compounds {{on specific}} oculo-vascular myiasis {{under field conditions}} are given. The results proved encouraging and showed that Dow-ET- 57, <b>Ruelene</b> and Neguvon, in this order of efficacy, have definite larvicidal actions against the causal Gedoelstia larvae. The mortality {{as well as the}} incidence of blindness were reduced notably by all three insecticides. The journals have been scanned in colour with a HP 5590 scanner; 600 dpi.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Acid and {{alkaline}} phosphatase was localized histochemically in the intestinal epithelium and excretory duct respectively in fresh frozen sections of Fasciola hepatica. Polyphenol oxidase was localized in the vitellaria, vitelline ducts and egg-shells. The distribution {{and nature of}} esterases was examined histochemically. Acetyl-cholinesterase was observed in the tegument, neural ganglia, neural commisure, acetabulum and oral sucker. Pseudocholinesterase was observed in the pharynx, cirrus, cirrus pouch wall, prostate gland sperm sac, testes, ovary, vitelline duct and duct walls of Mehlis' gland. Use of differential inhibitors of mammalian cholinesterases indicated that presence of acetylcholinesterase in structures containing pseudocholinesterase could not be demonstrated by differential enzyme activity. Non-specific esterase is reported in the excretory ducts and intestinal epithelium. The possible functions of the various esterases is discussed. Succinic dehydrogenase was observed in all those organs and tissues reported to contain esterases. It is reported from the cirrus, cirrus pouch wall, prostate gland and sperm sac for the first time. The effects of various concentrations of <b>Ruelene</b> (4 -tert-butyl- 2 -chlorophenyl methyl methyl phosphoramidate), Halaxon (di(2 -chloroethyl) 3 -chloro- 4 methylcoumarin- 7 -yl) phosphate, CoRal (0, 0 -diethyl- 0 - 3 -chloro- 4 -methyl- 2 -oxo- 2 H-l-benzyopyran- 7 -yl phosphorothioate), Dibenzylamine (DABA, 1, 6 bis (methylamino-methylphenoxy) hexane dihydrochloride), Tris (p-aminophenyl) carbonium chloride (TAC, pararosaniline chloride), Bayer 9015 (B 9015, 3, 3 '-dichloro- 5, 5 '-dinitro- 0, 0 '-biphenol), Bithionol (2, 2 '-thiobis (4, 6 -dichlorophenol) 'Actamer') were examined for inhibitory effect against fluke cholinesterases. Bithionol and B 9015 failed to inhibit esterases activity. CoRal, Neguvon, TAC and Halaxon inhibited all cholinesterase activity. <b>Ruelene</b> reversibly inhibited pharyngeal and reproductive complex cholinesterases but non-reversibly inhibited tegumental and neural Acetylcholinesterase. Dibenzylamine reversibly inhibited all cholinesterases. Bayer 9015 and DABA failed to inhibit excretory duct {{alkaline phosphatase}} activity. Bayer 9015 failed to inhibit acid phosphatase activity in intestinal epithelium. Bithionol, Bayer 9015 and Hexachlorophene (2, 2 ' dihydroxy- 3, 5, 6 - 3 ' 5 ' 6 ' hexachlorodiphenyl methane) all inhibited succinic dehydrogenase at all concentrations tested. Dibenzylamine had no inhibitory effect while TAC partially inhibited the staining reaction. Incubation of adult flukes in DABA-Hedon-Fleig saline for 8, 18 or 24 hours resulted in a decrease in PAS positive material and loss of tegument. This is compared with Bayer 9015 induced necrosis and a hypothesis explaining the mechanism of this necrosis is presented...|$|E
