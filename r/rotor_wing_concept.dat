5000|$|Rotor Blown Wing - Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin teamed {{to develop}} their {{unmanned}} <b>rotor</b> blown <b>wing</b> <b>concept.</b> They claimed it integrated fixed wing aerodynamics and advanced rotor control to provide a low complexity configuration. An artist depiction of Sikorsky's Rotor Blown Wing bore visual resemblance to the Boeing Heliwing, an unmanned tailsitter intended to reach [...] in forward flight; it first flew in April 1995 but crashed in July and the project was shelved. Sikorsky confirmed that the Rotor Blown Wing would be a tailsitter, with its name suggesting that the wing remains aligned into the proprotor wash during transition between vertical and forward, reducing download on the wing in hover mode.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems offered many {{advantages}} in several mapping {{applications such as}} slope mapping, geohazard studies, etc. This study utilizes UAV system for large scale stream mapping by using digital camera attached to the UAV. The digital camera combined with the UAV form a data acquisition system. This study only concentrates on one type of <b>rotor</b> <b>wing</b> UAV. It is becaue <b>rotor</b> <b>wing</b> units are stable and able to capture images easily. Aerial photograph were acquired {{in the form of}} strips which followed the procedure of acquiring aerial photograph where the 60 % forward lap and 30 % sidelap. Secondary data of ground control points and check points established using Total Station technique was used. The digital camera was calibrated using close range photogrammetric software and the recovered camera calibration parameters were then used in the processing of digital images. All the aerial photographs were processed using digital photogrammetric software and the output in the form of orthophoto was produced. The research output is then evaluated for planimetry and vertical accuracy using root mean square error (RMSE). Based on the analysis, sub-meter accuracy is obtained. As conclusion, <b>rotor</b> <b>wing</b> UAV system has potential use for large scale stream mapping or other diversified applications especially for small area which has limited time and less man power.
