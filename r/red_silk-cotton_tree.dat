5000|$|The trees {{growing out}} of the ruins {{are perhaps the most}} {{distinctive}} feature of Ta Prohm, and [...] "have prompted more writers to descriptive excess than any other feature of Angkor." [...] Two species predominate, but sources disagree on their identification: the larger is either the <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>tree</b> (Ceiba pentandra) or thitpok Tetrameles nudiflora, and the smaller is either the strangler fig (Ficus gibbosa). [...] or gold apple (Diospyros decandra). Angkor scholar Maurice Glaize observed, [...] "On every side, in fantastic over-scale, the trunks of the <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>trees</b> soar skywards under a shadowy green canopy, their long spreading skirts trailing the ground and their endless roots coiling more like reptiles than plants." ...|$|R
50|$|The Garudas have {{kings and}} cities, {{and at least}} some of them have the magical power of {{changing}} into human form when they wish to have dealings with people. On some occasions Garuda kings have had romances with human women in this form. Their dwellings are in groves of the simbalī, or <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Aziza (African) are {{a type of}} beneficent supernatural race in West African (specifically, Dahomey) mythology. Living in the forest, {{they provide}} good magic for hunters.

50|$|Iberá, in the {{northeast}} of Argentina, is a biologically rich region, with more than sixty ponds joined to marshes and swampland. The area is extremely humid, and is home to hundreds of bird species and thousands of insects, including {{a wide variety of}} butterflies. The area hosts a diverse array of flora and fauna, notably the royal water lily, <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>trees,</b> alligators, and capybara, the largest rodent species in the world.|$|R
5000|$|The River Ethiope {{which is}} {{reputed to be}} the deepest inland {{waterway}} in Africa (at 176 km). Its source is {{at the foot of}} a giant <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>tree</b> at Umuaja in Ukwuani Local Government Area of the state and flows through seven Local Government Areas in the State. It is a place of worship for Olokun traditional religion and also a common site for faithfuls of the Igbe Religious Movement.|$|R
50|$|The {{flag was}} first flown {{the day of}} independence, October 12, 1968, and it showed the {{national}} emblem in the center. However, in 1973, during the regime of Francisco Nguema, a different national emblem was used on the flag. Under Nguema's rule, the coat of arm consisted of several tools, a sword and a chicken. The modified national motto Trabajo (work), and Unidad, Paz, Justicia (Unity, Peace, Justice) was written in two stripes. The original coat of arms was restored after Nguema was deposed on 21 August 1979. The arms consists of a silver shield with a <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>tree,</b> which {{was derived from the}} arms of Rio Muni. Above the shield is an arc of 6 six-pointed yellow stars, that represent Rio Muni and the offshore islands. Beneath the shield is a silver scroll with the national motto, Unidad, Paz, Justicia ("Unity, Peace, Justice"). It is considered that under a <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>tree</b> a treaty was signed between Spain and a local ruler that {{marked the beginning of the}} colonial rule.|$|R
50|$|The park is {{accessible}} to tourists, and has well marked trails. There are two tree houses, one 140 feet {{high in a}} <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>tree,</b> from which visitors can view the park from above and observe bird life.Visitors can stay at chalets built on stilts, just outside the park entrance, surrounded by fig trees that are often occupied by Mona monkeys. Guides are available for forest walks, and will point out such things as termite nests and the many medicinal plants.|$|R
5000|$|Cochlospermum religiosum is a {{flowering}} plant from the tropical region of Southeast Asia and the Indian Subcontinent. It {{is a small}} tree growing to a height of 7.5 m usually found in dry deciduous forests. The name religiosum derives {{from the fact that}} the flowers are used as temple offerings. It is also known as <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>tree</b> because the capsules containing the seeds have a fluffy cotton-like substance similar to kapok. Another common name is buttercup tree because its yellow and bright flowers look like large-sized buttercups.|$|R
6000|$|I don't {{know what}} kind of a {{business}} man Mr. Chipperton was, but when Rectus told him that he had written a letter to his father which would make the thing all right, he was perfectly satisfied; and the next day we all went out in a sail-boat to the coral-reef, and had a splendid time, and the [...] "Tigress" [...] went off without any Chippertons. I think Mr. Chipperton put the whole thing down as the result of his lecture to Rectus up in the <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{proposed}} that I {{should go to}} my room and clean up a little first, but Corny couldn't wait. As her father had said, she wasn't good at waiting; and so we all went up into the <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>tree.</b> This was an enormous tree, with roots like the partitions between horse-stalls; it stood {{at the bottom of the}} hotel grounds, and had a large platform built up among the branches, with a flight of steps leading to it. There were seats up here, and room enough for a dozen people.|$|R
60|$|Bathurst has one {{compensating}} feature, the uncommon {{merit of}} an esplanade; the noble line of <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>trees</b> separating houses from river is apparently the only flourishing item. We remark {{that while some}} of these giants are clad in their old leaves others are bright green with new foliage, while others are bare and broomy as English woods in midwinter. They are backed by a truly portentous vegetation of red and white mangroves, palms, plantains, and baobabs, rank guinea-grass filling up every gap with stalks and blades ten feet tall.|$|R
40|$|This small, Greek Revival {{memorial}} borders {{the east}} side of the Plaza de Armas. It commemorates the city's first Catholic mass and town council meeting, which took place on the site in 1519. The temple was built in 1828. The first mass took place under a <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>tree,</b> so a tree of this species shades El Templete. Once or twice each century, the tree grows too large for the site, and is replaced.

5000|$|The dense {{forests of}} West Africa contain, in {{addition}} to a great variety of hardwoods, two palms, Elaeis guineensis (oil palm) and Raphia vinifera (bamboo palm), not found, generally speaking, in the savanna regions. Bombax or <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>trees</b> attain gigantic proportions in the forests, which are the home of the India rubber-producing plants and of many valuable kinds of timber trees, such as odum (Chlorophora excelsa), ebony, mahogany (Khaya senegalensis), Oldfieldia (Oldfieldia africana) and camwood (Baphia nitida). The climbing plants in the tropical forests are exceedingly luxuriant and the undergrowth or [...] "bush" [...] is extremely dense.|$|R
60|$|That afternoon, we had {{a meeting}} up in the <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>tree,</b> and Priscilla, who had sold out her small stock of flowers in the hotel-door market, was {{requested}} to be present. A variety-show, consisting {{of about a dozen}} young darkeys with their baskets and strings of sponges, accompanied her up the steps; but she was ordered to rout them, and she did it in short order. When we were alone, Rectus, as captain, began to state to her what we desired of her; but he was soon interrupted by Corny, who could do a great deal more talking in a given time than he could, and who always felt that she ought to begin early, in order to get through in good season.|$|R
50|$|The {{composition}} of the ecoregion's forests varies with moisture and soils. They have a three-storied structure, with the top story reaching 15 to 25 m. Arid areas are dominated by Anogeissus pendula growing in association with khair, especially on the quartzite ridges and gneiss hillocks of the Aravalli Range. Less arid areas are dominated by teak (Tectona grandis), bael (Aegle marmelos), Boswellia serrata, Desmodium oojeinense, Diospyros species, <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>tree,</b> Sterculia urens, Phyllanthus emblica, Dalbergia paniculata, and Terminalia elliptica. Mount Abu is covered in dry deciduous forest with conifers at the highest elevations. Thorn scrub forests, characterized by Euphorbia caducifolia, Maytenus emarginata, Acacia senegal, Commiphora mukul, Wrightia tinctoria, Flueggea leucopyrus, Grewia species, occur on rocky Aravalli hillsides and in degraded areas. The endemic species Dicliptera abuensis, Strobilanthes halbergii, and Veronica anagallis also grow in these areas. Date palms (Phoenix sylvestris) and fig trees (Ficus racemosa) grow near rivers and streams of the hills.|$|R
2500|$|Halfway {{along the}} path leading to the third enclosure, on the north side, is a House of Fire (or Dharmasala) similar to Ta Prohm's. The {{remainder}} of the fourth enclosure, now forested, was originally occupied by the city; as this was built of perishable materials it has not survived. The third enclosure wall is [...] In front of the third gopura is a cruciform terrace. The gopura itself is on a large scale, with three towers in the centre and two flanking pavilions. Between the southern two towers were two celebrated <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>trees,</b> of which Glaize wrote, [...] "resting on the vault itself of the gallery, [...] frame its openings and brace the stones in substitute for pillars in a caprice of nature that is as fantastic as it is perilous." [...] One of the trees is now dead, although the roots have been left in place. The trees {{may need to be}} removed to prevent their damaging the structure. On {{the far side of the}} temple, the third western gopura has pediments of a chess game and the Battle of Lanka, and two guardian dvarapalas to the west.|$|R
60|$|The {{meeting of}} the adherents was {{appointed}} for the next afternoon. We decided to have it on the Queen's Stair-way, which is a long flight of steps, cut in the solid limestone, and leading up out of a deep and shadowy ravine, where {{the people of the}} town many years ago cut out the calcareous material for their houses. There has been no stone cut here for a long time, and the walls of the ravine, which stand up as straight as the wall of a house, are darkened by age and a good deal covered up by vines. At the bottom, {{on each side of the}} pathway which runs through the ravine to the town, bushes and plants of various semi-tropical kinds grow thick and close. At the top of the flight of stairs are open fields and an old fort. Altogether, this was considered a quiet and suitable place for a meeting of a band of revolutionists. We could not have met in the <b>silk-cotton</b> <b>tree,</b> for we should have attracted too much attention, and, besides, the hotel-clerk would have routed us out.|$|R
50|$|The greater bulldog bat lives {{primarily}} in tropical lowlands. The bats are commonly found over ponds and streams {{as well as}} estuaries and coastal lagoons. They live in colonies that number in the hundreds. In Trinidad, bulldog bats roost in hollow <b>trees</b> like <b>silk-cotton,</b> <b>red</b> mangrove and balatá. The bats live in hollow tree roosts in other areas as well. They also roost in deep sea caves. Like most bats, bulldog bats are nocturnal.|$|R
