50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Cenozoic era and the early Alpine tectonic cycle, large anticlines, or folds were being formed in the Balkan Mountains, and during this time the region turned to dry land. About 45 million years ago, the rising <b>of</b> the Belogradchik <b>anticline</b> began, and during this folding, the limestone and the conglomerates in the core cracked, creating vertical and horizontal rifts in the <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>anticline.</b> In the core <b>of</b> the Belogradchik <b>anticline,</b> Paleozoic rocks are found and the slopes are formed of conglomerates, sandstone, and Jurassic limestone.|$|R
50|$|In the Cromerian Stage, before {{more recent}} {{glaciation}} had influenced the area, a <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> high ground, the Weald-Artois Anticline, joined the Upper Cretaceous chalk in Kent, England {{to that of}} the Boulonnais at Cap Blanc Nez in the Pas de Calais, France. It is possible that in the Cromerian Stage, the Outer Silver Pit was the bed of the combined Maas, Rhine, Scheldt and Thames. Since at that stage, the Weald-Artois Anticline had probably not been breached by the glacial lake outburst floods that scoured the Strait of Dover, the southern North Sea basin held a freshwater lake impounded by the <b>ridge</b> <b>of</b> the Weald-Artois <b>Anticline</b> and by the Norfolk-Friesland ridge. Whether the lake spilled north through the Outer Silver Pit would depend on how much the modern sea bed to the north has been raised by later marine and glacial sediment, and how much the various parts of the area were raised by forebulge effect caused by the weight of the Scandinavian ice cap. The east end of the Outer Silver Pit is in line with the lowest part <b>of</b> the Norfolk-Friesland <b>ridge.</b> The outlet at the western end of the pit appears to be blocked by somewhat higher ground.|$|R

40|$|During the Miocene, {{hydrocarbon}} seep-carbonates located atop intrabasinal {{highs and}} associated with sediment instability, formed commonly at the deformation {{front of the}} Northern Apennine collisional orogen. The parallelism between the structural trend {{and the distribution of}} seep-carbonates suggests a close relationship between tectonics and gas/fluid emission. The “Montepetra intrabasinal high” was formed during the closure stage of the foredeep, being related to the synsedimentary growth <b>of</b> an <b>anticline.</b> Field geometry suggests that detachment folding was the leading mechanism <b>of</b> <b>anticline</b> growth and synsedimentary instability along the anticline flanks. Ten different bodies of seep-carbonates occur in the Tortonian-early Messinian sediments: nine in the hinge zone and one in the southern backlimb <b>of</b> the <b>anticline.</b> Foraminiferal study, geochemistry, facies investigation and the three-dimensional geometry of carbonate bodies with respect to the encasing terrigenous sediments indicate a protracted (late Tortonian-early Messinian) activity of fluid migration with re-mobilization and ascent of sediments from the core <b>of</b> the <b>anticline,</b> stabilization <b>of</b> chemosynthesis-related communities, and in-situ brecciation. Seepage atop the intrabasinal high was fed by different circuits: one related to the compaction-dewatering of shallow (Tortonian-early Messinian) sediments, and a deeper one related to the deformation <b>of</b> the <b>anticline</b> core and to the activity of detachment surfaces and of faults propagating through the sedimentary cover...|$|R

30|$|For many years, {{this type}} of study was {{practically}} {{the only source of}} information on which exploratory efforts were based, and was even utilized in order to select the most favorable drilling sites. In the case <b>of</b> <b>anticline</b> folds discernible on the surface, many successful wells were drilled in the USA, solely based on the observation <b>of</b> exposed <b>anticline</b> tops. Until well into the twentieth century, these observations were preponderant in guiding exploratory efforts (Hoswell 1934). Other empirically guided exploratory methods were also successfully employed, such as “creekology,” or the drilling of successive wells along a riverbed or creek. If the first well was successful, subsequent wells drilled along the same creek had, in fact, a greater chance of being successful. Even without the understanding that we now have, regarding the geological processes that occur underground, many of those wells drilled followed the tops <b>of</b> <b>anticlines.</b> Those structures weakened surface rocks and facilitated their erosion, thus forming preferential channels for surface water flows. When drilling along such formations, those explorationists were unwittingly selecting the most favorable locations for hydrocarbon accumulations in the subsurface, and, not surprisingly, achieving greater success (Frehner 2004).|$|R

Given the important role of fracture characteristics for improving production, so the aim of this research is to investigate the density pattern of fracture in Asmari formation in Marun oilfield. For this purpose, results of image log, core data, graphic well log, methods of inscribed circle analysis and curvature changes geometry <b>of</b> <b>anticline</b> were analyzed. Asmari formation is the main reservoir rock in Marun oilfield that divided into five zones. Limestone and dolomite are the main lithology of zones 1, 2 and 3 which has a high density of fractures (especially in zones with 90 % dolomite). Also there is less fracture density (micro fracture) in the 4 and 5 Asmari zone due to an increase of shale and marl layers and due to less break ablity has a less distribution of fractures. The result show that there are a good conformity existed between the results of inscribed circle analysis, image log, core data, curvature and the presence of fractures in Marun anticline. The data indicate that highest density of fracture density concentrates in the southern limb in the central region <b>of</b> <b>anticline</b> and also in the north limb in the northeast region <b>of</b> the <b>anticline.</b> So, finally using these parameters, it is recommended that further development and production wells be drilled in the north eastern part of the oil filed as well as center part of southern flank <b>of</b> the <b>anticline...</b>|$|R
