5|$|In 2006, {{all three}} routes had their {{operations}} {{taken over by}} the MTA Bus Company brand of MTA Regional Bus Operations. The Q53 originally was a premium fare service, with a long nonstop segment between Rego Park to Broad Channel, as it was a <b>replacement</b> <b>service</b> for rail. Soon after the MTA's takeover of the route, it was converted to be a limited-stop service, with six stops along the corridor. Subsequently, the Q21 was extended up Woodhaven Boulevard, and its southern terminus in the Rockaways was switched. Increased ridership resulted {{in the creation of the}} Q21 Limited, which was soon replaced by the Q52 Limited, which replaced Q21 service south of Howard Beach.|$|E

Gatwick began upgrading its shuttle service in April 2008, with a bus <b>replacement</b> <b>service</b> in place from September 2009. A new operating system and shuttle cars (six Bombardier CX-100 vehicles) was installed, and the guideway and transit stations were refurbished at a total cost of £45million.

40|$|This {{research}} paper explores {{the importance of}} turnout location on the provision of bus <b>replacement</b> <b>services</b> that are required during periods of service disruption on a railway network. Turnouts allow trains to be guided from one railway track to another, enabling trains to turn around {{at a point where}} services are cancelled. They adjoin railway stations that will inevitably serve as an intermediate termination or commencement location on a railway line and where bus <b>replacement</b> <b>services</b> are provided to and from. A theoretical modelling exercise was undertaken to determine the impacts of altering turnout location based on fixed unplanned service disruption assumptions on the Sandringham railway line, in Melbourne’s suburban rail network. Attributes such as annual number of disruptions, level of commuter demand and volume of disruptions were assumed. Performance indicators including turnout cost, bus bridging costs and commuter disruption costs were assessed for each option. Results indicate that turnout location plays a significant role on the design of bus <b>replacement</b> <b>services</b> and can be a cost effective means of reducing costs to both user...|$|R
