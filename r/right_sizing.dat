Full length sizing of cartridges is often thought to greatly shorten case life by work hardening {{the full length of}} the case, which can cause the case neck to split, although some studies show that the number of reloads possible with a case is essentially the same for either full length sizing as for neck sizing only if the issue is one of neck hardening. If the reloaded cartridges are going {{to be used in the}} same firearm in which they were previously fired, though, and if that firearm has a bolt action or other action with a strong camming action on closing, then full length resizing may not be needed. A collet neck sizing die can be used to size just the case neck enough to hold the bullet, and leave the rest of the case unsized. The resulting cartridge will chamber into the specific rifle that previously fired it, though the fit might be tight and require more force to chamber than a full length resized case. The use of a neck-sizing die in conjunction with moderate pressure loads may extend the life of the case significantly by minimizing the amount of case that is work hardened or stretched. This is especially true for reloads intended for military rifles with intentionally large chambers such as the Lee–Enfield in [...]303 British. [...] The use of partial length or neck sizing for cartridges used in such large chambers permits effectively switching the headspacing from relying on the rim of a rimmed cartridge to the shoulder of the bottle neck transition instead, increasing the number of times a rimmed military cartridge can be reloaded from once to perhaps 5 or more times, all while avoiding dangerous incipient head separations. [...] One final form of limiting case wear is, unfortunately, limited strictly to benchrest shooters with custom-cut chambers. The chamber of these rifles is cut so that there is just enough room, typically just a few thousandths of an inch, in the neck area.

40|$|AbstractThe {{intensity}} of competition has increased within the Nigeria banking system, due to series of reforms {{that led to}} implementing organizational development in the industry as away of repositioning the country's economy {{to achieve the objective}} of becoming one of the 20 largest economy by the year 2020. Creating a sustainable competitive advantage therefore has become paramount importance considering the institutional changes that were introduced in form of strategy to conform to the changing norms and patterns of operation in the industry. Such strategies include merger and acquisitions, private placement, re-engineering process, <b>right</b> <b>sizing</b> and so on. This paper attempts to evaluate employee's perception of change effect as a competitive advantage on the Nigeria banking industry, thereby assessing employees’ perception of change effect on personal job outcome variables in relation to change success. Using multiple regression analysis, the findings of the study reveal the existence of significant relationship between employees’ perception of change success and the personal job outcome variables. The beta analysis shows that employee perception of job commitment; good salary and job security were the strong determinants of employee perception of change effect with perception of self- actualization and career progression as the weak determinants. It is proffered in the paper that change agents in the banking industry should always consider the aspect of job security and motivational incentives when implementing change...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{existing}} TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) {{is known}} to be unsuitable for a network with the characteristics of high BDP (Bandwidth-Delay Product) because of the fixed small or large buffer size at the TCP sender and receiver. Thus, some trial cases of adjusting the buffer sizes automatically with respect to network condition have been proposed to improve the end-to-end TCP throughput. ATBT (Automatic TCP Buffer Tuning) attempts to assure the buffer size of TCP sender according to its current Congestion Window size (CWND), but the ATBT assumes that the buffer size of TCP receiver is maximum value that operating system defines. In DRS(Dynamic <b>Right</b> <b>Sizing),</b> by estimating the TCP arrival data of two times the amount TCP data received previously, the TCP receiver simply reserves the buffer size for the next arrival, accordingly. However, we do not need to reserve exactly two times of buffer size because of the possibility of TCP segment loss. We propose an efficient TCP buffer Tuning technique (called TBT-PLR: TCP Buffer Tuning technique based on packet loss ratio) since we adopt the ATBT mechanism and the TBT-PLR mechanism for the TCP sender and the TCP receiver, respectively. For the purpose of testing the actual TCP performance, we implemented our TBT-PLR by modifying the linux kernel version 2. 4. 18 and evaluated the TCP performance by comparing TBT-PLR with the TCP schemes of the fixed buffer size. As a result, more balanced usage among TCP connections was obtained...|$|E

40|$|Industrial cooling {{remains one}} of the largest {{potential}} areas for electrical energy savings in industrial plants today. This is in spite of a relatively small amount of attention paid to it by energy auditors and rebate program designers. US DOE tool suites, for example, have long focused on combustion related systems and motor systems with a focus on pumps and compressors. A chilled water tool designed by UMass was available for some time but is no longer being supported by its designers or included in the government tool website. Even with the focus on motor systems, auditing programs like the DOE's Industrial Assessment Center program show dramatically less energy savings for electrical based systems than fossil fueled ones. This paper demonstrates the large amount of increased saving from a critical review of plant chilled water systems with both hardware and operational improvements. After showing several reasons why cooling systems are often ignored during plant energy surveys (their complexity, lack of data on operations etc.), three specific upgrades are considered which have become more reliable and cost effective in the recent past. These include chiller changeouts, <b>right</b> <b>sizing</b> of systems with load matching, and floating head pressures as a retrofit. Considerations of free cooling and improved cooling tower operations are shown as additional "big hitters?.

40|$|M. Ed. This {{research}} {{essay is}} an endeavour {{to address the}} community problems faced by senior phase students with regards to lack of guidance in the Etwatwa area. Guidance is offered within the school to a certain extent, however, it does not accomplish what it is supposed to. It is not regarded as an important subject as it is non-examinable subject. There is no link of the subject between the formal guidance education received at school, and the informal education {{taking place in the}} community. By means of an intensive investigation conducted through observation and in depth interviews, a conclusion was reached {{that there is a need}} for guidance intervention in this area in order to address the breakdown of family and societal life which are community problems. The study will focus on the role of guidance in addressing community issues in the Etwatwa informal settlement. Findings from the study suggest that the community and the school do not work together on addressing community problems such as teenage pregnancy, rape, poverty and child abuse. Evidence also suggests that the school provides no proper guidance given to students in order for them to face the outside world. There is also a problem due to of some school managers not giving sufficient support to the teaching of the subject.

40|$|Purpose – Organizational downsizing, <b>right</b> <b>sizing,</b> layoffs, and {{restructuring}} {{that attempt to}} reduce labour cost and increase competitiveness, have generated considerable feelings of job insecurity among today's employees. Conversely, the rapidity {{of change in the}} Middle Eastern region, coupled with the unpredictability of economic conditions, the inevitable need to survive and the ever‐lasting craving for organizational success merge to aggravate the adverse effects of job insecurity. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to study the relationship between job insecurity and powerlessness, management trust, peer trust and job satisfaction within Lebanon. Design/methodology/approach – Employees working within medium‐sized organizations in Lebanon were surveyed to measure their perceptions of job insecurity, job satisfaction, powerlessness, and interpersonal trust. Statistical analyses were performed using Pearson correlation matrix and linear regression tests. Findings – The study identified significant positive relationship between job insecurity and powerlessness, and negative relationships between job insecurity and management trust and job satisfaction. No significant relationship was found between job insecurity and peer trust. Research limitations/implications – The study adds to the existing job insecurity literature by empirically testing the relationship between job insecurity and powerlessness, peer trust, management trust and job satisfaction within Lebanese organizations. The researchers hope that this study will assist managers in understanding the importance of earning their subordinates' trust and its implications on job insecurity which could also negatively affect job satisfaction. Also, the issue of powerlessness should be seriously considered by management since it triggers the feeling of job insecurity. Originality/value – Western organizational behavior literature has given the topic of job insecurity significant attention. However, no scholarly research has yet examined the topic of job insecurity within the Middle East. This paper sheds light on important results regarding job insecurity and its consequences. Powerlessness predicts and aggravates job insecurity, and is affected by the nature of the job; trust in management has a negative effect on job insecurity, while peer trust has no influence. Also, job satisfaction is influenced by the perceptions of job insecurity. PublishedN/...|$|E
