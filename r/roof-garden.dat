60|$|The 1st of July, 1913, Ruth {{left for}} the Patton Kerrs' country house in the Berkshires, near Pittsfield. Carl wrote to her every day. He told her, apropos of Touricars and <b>roof-gardens</b> and {{aviation}} records and Sunday motor-cycling with Bobby Winslow, that he loved her; he even made, {{at the end of}} his letters, the old-fashioned lines of crosses to represent kisses. Whenever he hinted how much he missed her, how much he wanted to feel her startle in his arms, he wondered what she would read out of it; wondered if she would put the letter under her pillow.|$|R
60|$|But {{with what}} a {{difference}} the mid-autumn of the town welcomes its returners! Ghosts, we have called them, mainly to humor a figure we began with, but they are ghosts rather in the meaning of revenants, {{which is a good}} meaning enough. They must be a very aged or very stupid sort of revenants if their palingenetic substance does not thrill at the first nightly vision of Broadway, of that fairy flare of electric lights, advertising whiskeys and actresses and beers, and luring the beholder into a hundred hotels and theatres and restaurants. It is now past the hour of <b>roof-gardens</b> with their songs and dances, but the vaudeville is in full bloom, and the play-houses are blossoming in the bills of their new comedies and operas and burlesques. The pavements are filled, but not yet crowded, with people going to dinner at the tables d'hôte; the shop windows glitter and shine, and promise a delight for the morrow which the morrow may or may not realize.|$|R

60|$|The {{following}} {{few days}} were as gold and silver. Edward Pinkhammer, yet counting {{back to his}} birth by hours only, knew the rare joy of having come upon so diverting a world full-fledged and unrestrained. I sat entranced on the magic carpets provided in theatres and <b>roof-gardens,</b> that transported one into strange and delightful lands full of frolicsome music, pretty girls and grotesque drolly extravagant parodies upon human kind. I went here and there at my own dear will, bound by no limits of space, time or comportment. I dined in weird cabarets, at weirder tables d'hôte {{to the sound of}} Hungarian music and the wild shouts of mercurial artists and sculptors. Or, again, where the night life quivers in the electric glare like a kinetoscopic picture, and the millinery of the world, and its jewels, and the ones whom they adorn, and the men who make all three possible are met for good cheer and the spectacular effect. And among all these scenes that I have mentioned I learned one thing that I never knew before. And that is that the key to liberty is not in the hands of License, but Convention holds it. Comity has a toll-gate at which you must pay, or you may not enter the land of Freedom. In all the glitter, the seeming disorder, the parade, the abandon, I saw this law, unobtrusive, yet like iron, prevail. Therefore, in Manhattan you must obey these unwritten laws, and then you will be freest of the free. If you decline to be bound by them, you put on shackles.|$|R
6000|$|But {{instead of}} {{instantly}} complying our friend {{fell into a}} smiling muse, from which he broke at last to say: [...] "I have long been touched by the pathos of a fact which I believe is not yet generally known. Do you know yourself, with the searching knowledge which is called feeling it in your bones, that a good many Southerners and Southerly Westerners make this town their summer resort?" [...] We intimated that want of penetrating statistics which we perceived would gratify him, and he went on. [...] "They put up at our hotels which in the 'anguish of the solstice' they find invitingly vacant. As soon as they have registered the clerk recognizes them as Colonel, or Major, or Judge, but gives them the rooms which no amount of family or social prestige could command in the season, and there they stay, waking each day from unmosquitoed nights to iced-melon mornings, until a greater anguish is telegraphed forward by the Associated Press. Then they turn their keys in their doors, and flit to the neighboring Atlantic or the adjacent Catskills, till the solstice recovers a little, and then they return to their hotel and resume their life in the city, which they have almost to themselves, with its parks and drives and <b>roof-gardens</b> and vaudevilles, unelbowed by {{the three or four}} millions of natives whom we leave behind us when we go to Europe, or Newport, or Bar Harbor, or the Adirondacks. Sometimes they take furnished flats along the Park, and settle into a greater permanency than their hotel sojourn implies. They get the flats at about half the rent paid by the lessees who sublet them, but I call it pathetic that they should count it joy to come where we should think it misery to stay. Still, everything is comparative, and I suppose they are as reasonably happy in New York as I am in my London lodgings in the London season, where I sometimes stifle in a heat not so pure and clear as that I have fled from." ...|$|R
40|$|Brasilia’s urban {{landscape}} {{is almost entirely}} consisted of modern architecture. Buildings constructed from the 1960 s {{to the present day}} follow Le Corbusier’s concepts proposed in 1926 : the supports, <b>roof-gardens,</b> the free ground plan, and horizontal windows and free façade. Besides this, modern Brazilian architecture exhibits characteristics such as the presence of crafts, integrated arts, lightness, symbolism; and the influence of the Promenade of Le Corbusier’s. All these elements combined define the design of the modern space usually materialized with apparent concrete, glass and steel, among other materials. These elements are commonly used by preservationists during interventions in historic heritages, due to its distinguishable characteristics in terms of material consistency and patina. However, the presence of patina is not so easily accepted in modern heritage buildings. In this scenario, steel corrosion, small cracks in the concrete and patches on the coating are signs of pathologies and do not mean value, such as age-value. Authenticity is a tool to appraise values normally present on the fabric of the heritage and on the patina; but how to assess modern buildings’ significance where material consistency alone is no longer a defining characteristic of the heritage? This paradigm involves the understanding of modern architecture not only by its physical consistency, but also by its spatial logic design. In addition, modern laws require access to cultural heritage for all, a challenge to the preservation of historical or recent heritage buildings. This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of state-of-the-art of the preservation of Brazilian modern heritage sites through the analysis of the Palace of Justice Raymundo Faoro designed by Oscar Niemeyer in 1962. This goal might be achieved through the use of the Matrix of Authenticity and Accessibility [1] that provides building characterization with emphasis on authenticity and guides the interventions for universal access adaptations, through the identification of architectural barriers and their impacts on material consistency and on the original spatial design. This article suggests the Matrix is an effective tool for obtaining a complete information framework, a guideline for adaptations of historical or modern heritage...|$|R

60|$|The {{events of}} the evening had been a revelation to Psmith. He had not {{realised}} before {{the extent of the}} ramifications of New York's underworld. That members of the gangs should crop up in the Astor <b>roof-garden</b> and in gorgeous raiment in the middle of Broadway was a surprise. When Billy Windsor had mentioned the gangs, he had formed a mental picture of low-browed hooligans, keeping carefully to their own quarter of the town. This picture had been correct, as far as it went, but it had not gone far enough. The bulk of the gangs of New York are of the hooligan class, and are rarely met with outside their natural boundaries. But each gang has its more prosperous members; gentlemen, who, like the man of the Astor <b>roof-garden,</b> support life by more delicate and genteel methods than the rest. The main body rely for their incomes, except at election-time, on such primitive feats as robbing intoxicated pedestrians. The aristocracy of the gangs soar higher.|$|E

60|$|The {{young man}} from the west had arrived in New York only that afternoon, and his cousin, town born and bred, had already {{embarked}} upon the task of showing him the great city.

60|$|It {{was a warm}} night, and the <b>roof-garden</b> was full. From {{where they}} sat {{they could see the}} million {{twinkling}} lights of the city. Towards the end of the meal, Psmith's gaze concentrated itself on the advertisement of a certain brand of ginger-ale in Times Square. It is a mass of electric light arranged {{in the shape of a}} great bottle, and at regular intervals there proceed from the bottle's mouth flashes of flame representing ginger-ale. The thing began to exercise a hypnotic effect on Psmith. He came to himself with a start, to find Billy Windsor in conversation with a waiter.|$|E
60|$|The apartments {{are much}} better fitted {{for a family of}} generous size than those which Mr. Homos observed. Children, who were once almost unheard of, and quite unheard, in apartment-houses, {{increasingly}} abound under favor of the gospel of race preservation. The elevators are full of them, and in the grassy courts round which the houses are built, the little ones play all day long, or paddle in the fountains, warmed with steam-pipes in the winter, and cooled to an agreeable temperature in a summer which has almost lost its terrors for the stay-at-home New-Yorker. Each child has his or her little plot of ground in the <b>roof-garden,</b> where they are taught the once wellnigh forgotten art of agriculture.|$|E

Some of 'em were stockmen and some gamblers and some horse peculators and plenty were in the smuggling line.

60|$|The New Yorker {{sat at a}} <b>roof-garden</b> table, ingesting solace {{through a}} straw. His panama lay upon a chair. The July {{audience}} was scattered among vacant seats as widely as outfielders when the champion batter steps to the plate. Vaudeville happened at intervals. The breeze was cool from the bay; around and above--everywhere except on the stage--were stars. Glimpses were to be had of waiters, always disappearing, like startled chamois. Prudent visitors who had ordered refreshments by 'phone in the morning were now being served. The New Yorker was aware of certain drawbacks to his comfort, but content beamed softly from his rimless eyeglasses. His family was out of town. The drinks were warm; the ballet was suffering from lack of both tune and talcum--but his family would not return until September.|$|E
60|$|Something--the {{beauty of}} the night, perhaps, or some faint {{aftermath}} of sentimentality born of Sonia's emotion--tempted him during those few moments to relax. He threw aside his mask and breathed the freer for it. Once more he was a human being, treading the streets of a real city, his feet very much upon the earth, his heart full of the simplest things. All the scheming {{of the last few}} days was forgotten, the great issues, the fine yet devious way to be steered amidst the rocks which beset him; even the depression of the calamitous news from the North Sea passed away. He was a very simple human being, and he was in love. It was all so unpractical, so illusionary, and yet so real. Events, actual happenings--he thrust all thoughts of these away from his mind. What she might be thinking of him at the moment he ignored. He was content to let his thoughts rest upon her, to walk through the moonlit street, his brain and heart revelling in that subtle facility of the imagination which brought her so easily to his presence. It was such a vividly real Pamela, too, who spoke and walked and moved by his side. His memory failed him nowhere, followed faithfully the kaleidoscopic changes in her face and tone, showed him even that long, grateful, searching glance when their eyes had met in Von Teyl's sitting-room. There had been times when she had shown clearly enough that she was anxious to understand, anxious to believe in him. He clung to the memory of these; pushed into the background that faint impression he had had of her at the <b>roof-garden,</b> serene and proud, yet with a faint look of something like pain in her startled eyes.|$|E
6000|$|For {{the reader}} {{who has been}} on the spot the poet's words will paint a vivid picture of the scene; for the reader who has not been there, so much the worse; he should lose no time in going, and {{drinking}} a cup of the local wine at a table of the restaurant now in possession of Mr. Gray's point of view. I do not know a more filling moment, exclusive of the wine, than he can enjoy there, with those cascades before him and those temples beside him; for Mr. Gray has mentioned only one of the two, I do not know why, that exist on this enchanted spot, and that define their sharp, black shadows as with an inky line just beyond the restaurant tables. One is round and the other oblong, and the round one has been called the Sibyls', though now it is getting itself called Vesta's--the goddess who long unrightfully claimed the temple of Mater Matuta in the Forum Boarium at Rome. As Vesta has lately been dispossessed there by archaeology (which seems in Rome to enjoy the plenary powers of our Boards of Health), she may have been given the Sibyls' Temple at Tivoli in compensation; but all this does not really matter. What really matters is the mighty chasm which yawns away almost from your feet, where you sit, and the cataracts, from their brinks, high or low, plunging into it, and the wavering columns of mist weakly striving upward out of it: the whole hacked by those mountains Mr. Gray mentions, with belts of olive orchard on their flanks, and wild paths furrowing and wrinkling their stern faces. To your right there is a sheeted cataract falling from the basins of the town laundry, where the toil of the washers melts into music, and their chatter, like that of birds, drifts brokenly across the abyss to you. While you sit musing or murmuring in your rapture, two mandolins and a guitar smilingly intrude, and after a prelude of Italian airs swing into strains which presently, through your revery, you recognize as [...] "In the Bowery" [...] and [...] "Just One Girl," [...] and the smile of the two mandolins and the guitar spreads to a grin of sympathy, and you are no longer at the Cafe Sibylla in Tivoli, but in your own Manhattan on some fairy <b>roof-garden,</b> or at some sixty-cent table d'hote, with wine and music included.|$|E
6000|$|We {{had passed}} then, on the {{occasion}} of our several pilgrimages, in beneath the great flying, or at least straddling buttresses {{to the left of the}} mighty façade, where you enter that great idle precinct of fine dense pavement and averted and sacrificed grandeur, the reverse of the monstrous medal of the front. Here the architectural monster rears its back and shoulders on an equal scale and this whole unregarded world of colossal consistent symmetry and hidden high finish gives you the measure of the vast total treasure of items and features. The outward face of all sorts of inward majesties of utility and ornament here above all correspondingly reproduces itself; the expanses of golden travertine--the freshness of tone, the cleanness of surface, in the sunny air, being extraordinary--climb and soar and spread under the crushing weight of a scheme carried out in every ponderous particular. Never was such a show of wasted art, of pomp for pomp's sake, as where all the chapels bulge and all the windows, each one a separate constructional masterpiece, tower above almost grassgrown vacancy; with the full and immediate effect, of course, of reading us a lesson on the value of lawful pride. The pride is the pride of indifference as to whether a greatness so founded be gaped at in all its features or not. My friend and I were alone to gape at them most often while, for the unfailing impression of them, on our way to watch the casting of our figure, we extended our circuit of the place. To which I may add, as another example of that tentative, that appealing twitch of the garment of Roman association of which one kept renewing one's consciousness, the half-hour at the little foundry itself was all charming--with its quite shabby and belittered and ramshackle recall of the old Roman [...] "art-life" [...] of one's early dreams. Everything was somehow in the picture, the rickety sheds, the loose paraphernalia, the sunny, grassy yard where a goat was browsing; then the queer interior gloom of the pits, frilled with little overlooking scaffoldings and bridges, for the sinking fireward of the image that was to take on hardness; and all the pleasantness and quickness, the beguiling refinement, of the three or four light fine [...] "hands" [...] of whom the staff consisted and into whose type and tone one liked to read, with whatever harmless extravagance, so many signs that a lively sense of stiff processes, even in humble life, could still leave untouched the traditional rare feeling for the artistic. How delightful such an occupation in such a general setting--those of my friend, I at such moments irrepressibly moralised; and how one might after such a fashion endlessly go and come and ask nothing better; or if better, only so to the extent of another impression I was to owe to him: that of an evening meal spread, in the warm still darkness that made no candle flicker, on the wide high space of an old loggia that overhung, in one quarter, the great obelisked Square preceding one of the Gates, and in the other the Tiber and the far Trastevere and more things than I can say--above all, as it were, the whole backward past, the mild confused romance of the Rome one had loved and of which one was exactly taking leave under protection of the friendly lanterned and garlanded feast and the commanding, all-embracing <b>roof-garden.</b> It was indeed a reconciling, it was an altogether penetrating, last hour.|$|E

On the roof on the 34th Street side was the grand promenade, 90 x 200 ft, on solid footing high in the air, with a band stand, fountains, and trellises of columns. The roof garden restaurant occupied a space 75 x 84 ft, and was roofed in. The ceiling was 24 ft high. At the northeast and northwest corners of the roof garden were towers, with spiral stairways within, {{leading up to the}} copper covered roofs of the pavilions, which were 250 ft above the sidewalk. The palm gardens, used as cafes, rose to a height of two and three stories respectively and were roofed-over with domes of tinted glass. Balconies at the various floor levels opened on to these courts to overlook them. The materials used were cream-colored brick and terracotta, and were Italian Renaissance in style.|$|E
5000|$|After the Fair Rideout {{returned}} to San Francisco and married Fred Canady. She abandoned her art career, {{and moved to}} New York, where she remarried, and [...] "disappeared from history."For the decorative, as for the structural scheme, designs were invited among women qualified for such work throughout the United States, and after eager and close competition the prize was awarded to Alice Rideout, of San Francisco. The pediment and symbolic groups of the <b>roof-garden</b> were her work. On the roof were winged groups typical of feminine characteristics and virtues, in choicest symbolism. One of the central figures represented the spirituality of woman, and at her feet a pelican, emblem of love and sacrifice. In the same group charity was {{side by side with}} virtue, and sacrifice was further symbolized by a nun, placing her jewels on the altar. Another group represented the genius of civilization, a student at her right and a woman at her left struggling through darkness for the light. All these and other groups represent the genius and labor of Miss Alice Rideout. The center of the pediment was occupied by Minerva with Wisdom's owl at her feet, and on either side, women's work in the progress of civilization was typified by literature, art, and home life.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{containing}} restaurants, {{bars and}} a palm garden (added in 1935), the completed building underwent {{a number of}} alterations and extensions in rapid succession, and the theatre had three different names {{in just a few}} years: opened as the Phoebus Palast in 1926, it became the Emelka Palast in 1932 and Europa Palast in 1935. The exterior was adorned by a large number of illuminated advertising signs, of which two in particular made it a major landmark on the Berlin skyline, day and night: one advertising Allianz insurance company, who also had office-space in the building when it first opened, and the other advertising Odol mouthwash. The latter was mounted on a tower, erected in 1935, which brought the total height of the building to 50 m.After 1933 the central office block was taken over by the Nazi government authorities, who had the neon signs removed and occupied it with numerous affiliated organisations, particularly the Reich Ministry of Labour. The building sustained much damage during the Allied bombing raids of World War II, but was not a complete write-off. Although the northernmost section containing the ballroom was subsequently demolished, the remainder was renovated, and spent the next few decades occupied by various offices. The postwar restoration converted the <b>roof-garden</b> facility into a more enclosed 12th storey, as well as altering other details of the structure, and did not recreate the famous illuminated signage.|$|E
