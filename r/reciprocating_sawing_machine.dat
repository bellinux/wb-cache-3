40|$|In the {{handling}} of bulk metals, it is common practice to use a <b>sawing</b> <b>machine,</b> such as a bandsaw or power hacksaw to reduce the workpiece to a manageable size for downstream processing. Recently, stationary power hacksaws have been replaced with more versatile portable electric <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws.</b> These <b>machines</b> differ from bandsaws and power hacksaws {{in that they are}} portable, light-weight, and <b>saw</b> by rapidly <b>reciprocating</b> a blade over a short stroke length. In industrial applications, the speed of metal sawing is an important economic factor. The mechanics of metal <b>sawing</b> with traditional <b>machines</b> have been described in the literature, but virtually no research has been published on the mechanics of <b>reciprocating</b> <b>sawing.</b> Research was undertaken to describe metal <b>sawing</b> with <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> by the application of metal cutting mechanics. Cutting rates of metals with a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> are dependent upon several process parameters, such as the applied pressure on the <b>saw,</b> the <b>reciprocating</b> speed of the saw blade, and the geometry of the cutting edges. An analytical model was developed to predict the cutting rate of metals with a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw.</b> Particular attention was placed on the sawing rates of steel due to their broad commercial usage. The analytical model for <b>reciprocating</b> <b>sawing</b> rates was compared to empirical studies of important process parameters. A wear model for the cutting edges of saw blade teeth was also derived. Using a Design of Experiments technique, a test matrix was developed to determine the significance of applied thrust force and reciprocating speed on cutting rates of steel. Results of analytical predictions from the newly developed sawing model and empirical data compared reasonably well...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} {{research}} is {{a new type of}} the multirip <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> with circular <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> blades. This <b>machine</b> has a number of advantages in comparison with other machines of similar purpose. The paper presents an overview of different types of saw equipment and describes basic characteristics of the machine under investigation. Using the concept of lifecycle management of the considered machine in a unified information space is necessary to improve quality and competitiveness in the current production environment. In this lifecycle all the members, namely designers, technologists, customers, etc., have a philosophy to tend to optimize the overall machine design as much as possible. However, it is not always possible to achieve. Conversely, at the boundary between the phases there are several mismatching situations, if not even conflicting inconsistencies. For example, improvement of mass characteristics can lead to poor stability and rigidity of the <b>saw</b> blade. <b>Machine</b> output improvement through increasing frequency of the machine motor rotation, on the other side, results in reducing stable ability of the saw blades and so on. In order to provide a coherent framework for the collaborative environment between the members of the life cycle, the article presents a technique to construct a mathematical model that allows combining all different members’ requirements in the unified information model. The article also gives analysis of kinematic and dynamic behavior and technological characteristics of the machine. Describes in detail all the controlled parameters, functional constraints, and quality criteria of the machine under consideration. Depending on the controlled parameters, the analytical relationships formulate functional constraints and quality criteria of the machine. The proposed algorithm allows fast and exact calculation of all the functional constraints and quality criteria of the machine for a given vector of the control variables. Based on the obtained unified information model, a multi-criterion problem has been formulated for the process of automated synthesis and rational choice to design and manufacture the multirip <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> of new generation. </p...|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} examined {{the features that}} may differentiate cuts made in bone by mechanical and hand-powered saws, specifically investigating the characteristics of commercially available <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws.</b> The partial limbs of adult white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were used {{as a proxy for}} human remains, and were cut using five commercially available <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> blades and a hand-powered hacksaw. The reciprocating blades tested ranged from five teeth-per-inch to 14 / 18 teeth-per-inch and included raker, alternating, and wavy tooth sets. The hacksaw blade had 32 teeth-per-inch, with wavy set teeth. All the blades examined were intended to cut wood, metal, or both materials. The resulting false start kerfs and complete kerfs on the remains were then examined macroscopically and microscopically. The present study utilized both qualitative and quantitative analysis to examine kerf features that characterize <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws.</b> The presentation of specific features within the kerf varied based upon blade properties, how the implement was powered, and how it was wielded in reference to the material. The {{results of the present study}} demonstrated that significant differences do exist between <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> blades. Kerf characteristics in which significant differences were noted include: kerf false start (cross section) shape, frequency of cut surface drift, presence of harmonics, striation regularity, and exit chipping size. Inter-blade differences generally reflect class characteristics previously established for hand-powered blades, though reciprocating blades do not strictly follow these categorizations (Symes 1992; Symes et al. 1998, 2010). Identification of inter-blade differences allows the limited identification of sub-classes within <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saws</b> based on the above characteristics, though blades cannot be uniquely identified. Additionally, interior exit chipping was noted, which has not been mentioned in previous sharp force trauma research. Ultimately, this research has applications for sharp force trauma analysis and further aids in the identification of <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> use in a forensic context, including dismemberments...|$|R

40|$|The Los Alamos LSDDP {{demonstrated}} a Mega-Tech hydraulic cutting shear to remove legs from plutonium glove boxes.

30|$|In {{order to}} confirm the IOF, orbitozygomatic {{osteotomy}} is essential. After the periorbit is elevated from the outer or lower wall of the orbit, {{the tip of the}} <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> is positioned in the outermost part of the IOF from {{the lower part of the}} orbit. Osteotomy should be performed along the malar eminence. A beveled or V-shaped bone cut is performed using a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> to increase the exposure and return the bone to its original position after the operation. If the tumor mass does not involve the temporal bone or the petrous portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA), this level of osteotomy is sufficient for exposure to the infratemporal skull base. However, if removal of the petrous portion of the ICA is required, the glenoid fossa should be removed together with osteotomized bony segments, and temporal craniotomy may be performed to expose the glenoid fossa. TMJ capsule can be freed from the fossa and lowered for full exposure, but the capsule and meniscus should be preserved if possible. If additional exposure is required, the condyle can be removed from the sigmoid notch. A V-shaped bone cut can be performed using a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>saw</b> to remove the outer two thirds of the glenoid fossa. By thus removing the glenoid fossa, the ICA inside the glenoid fossa can be protected.|$|R

40|$|The thesis investigates optical {{measuring}} {{and statistical}} data processing, and presents {{a method to}} understand and reduce sawing variation by examination of sawn timber sizes. Continuous timber size control offers improved opportunities for analysing <b>saw</b> <b>machines</b> or even individual sawblades. The thesis is illustrated with seven <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> case studies {{that relate to the}} development of the technique. Log and cant breakdown is examined in single- and double-arbor circular saws and bandsaws. The first analysis of each <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> is made in normal production, and the second using a controlled benchmarking test. A total of 44350 logs were sawn in the study. The behaviour of a <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> is described using such descriptors as total, within-board and between-board standard deviations, and sawblade bend. Based on observations in benchmarking, an equation y=αeβx±R, where α and β are constants, R the process reproducibility, and x a variable that expresses sawing time and saw load, can be established for each of the <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> descriptors. An example is the total standard deviation descriptor function s= 0. 21 e 0. 58 x± 0. 11, established for a single-arbor circular saw in a 4 -piece saw set-up. The method will help a sawmill to establish descriptors and equations used to describe the behaviour of their <b>saw</b> <b>machines,</b> to baseline <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> performance and to compare it to best practices in the industry. The descriptors may be used to establish current, short- or long-term capabilities and characteristics. The method can be used to examine various production conditions and tooling, such as effects of log size, feed speed, and sawing time. Other factors include saw speed, sawblade parameters, operation of setworks and feedworks, and effects of seasons. The results of the study show that sawblade behaviour, feedworks and work piece holding problems, and previous <b>saw</b> <b>machines</b> may be causes of large sawing variation. reviewe...|$|R
