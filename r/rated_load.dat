Both uniform and non-uniform strain <b>rate</b> <b>loads</b> were applied to the notched and un-notched composite specimens, respectively.

Application of the initial crack size for the characteristic distance of the Average Stress failure criterion yielded acceptable tensile notch strengths. The compressive notch strength was less sensitive to the tensile notch strength. The non-constant, varying strain <b>rate</b> <b>loading</b> showed that the failure strength and stiffness depend on the history of the applied <b>loading</b> <b>rates.</b> The effects of the varying strain rates on both notched and un-notched specimens were different qualitatively.
