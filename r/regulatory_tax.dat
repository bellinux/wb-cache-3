5000|$|The Netherlands {{initiated}} {{a carbon tax}} in 1990. However, in 1992 it was replaced with a 50/50 carbon/energy tax called the Environmental Tax on Fuels, the taxes are assessed partly on carbon content and partly on energy content. The charge {{was transformed into a}} tax and became part of general tax revenues. As such, it fell under the administration of the Ministry of Finance. The general fuel tax is collected on all hydrocarbon fuels. Fuels used as raw materials are not subject to the tax. Tax rates are based 50/50 on the energy and carbon contents of fuels. In 1996 The <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Tax</b> on Energy, another 50/50 carbon/energy tax, was also implemented. The Environmental tax and the <b>regulatory</b> <b>tax</b> are 5.16 Dutch guilder, or NLG, (~$3.13) or per tonne of CO2 and 27.00 NLG (~16.40) per tonne CO2 respectively. Under the general fuel tax, electricity is not taxed, though fuels used to produce electricity are taxable. Energy-intensive industries used to benefit from preferential rates under this tax but the benefit was cancelled in January 1997. Also, since 1997 nuclear power has been taxed under the general fuel tax at the rate of NLG 31.95 per gram of uranium-235.38 The European Environment Agency put out an Executive Summary stating [...] "Although the 5th Environmental Action Programme of the EU in 1992 recommended the greater use of economic instruments such as environmental taxes, there has been little progress in their use since then at the EU level." [...] However, [...] "at Member State level, there has been a continuing increase in the use of environmental taxes over the last decade, which has accelerated in the last 5-6 year...Countries including the Netherlands and the United Kingdom." ...|$|E

In this paper, we apply and extend Glaeser and Gyourko's methodology in order to estimate the <b>regulatory</b> <b>tax</b> on an individual house level in a set of Florida metropolitan areas. Our novel data address some of the quality measurement concerns raised about the Glaeser and Gyourko methodology and allow us to look at the evolution of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>tax</b> over a 10 -year period. We find that the tax is an important component of sales price and that as a percentage of sales price has increased in a majority of Florida's MSAs. In addition, we decompose the overall house price increase into land, materials and regulatory components and find that increasing stringency in the regulatory environment within Florida represents a substantial portion of the run-up in house prices in most metropolitan areas. <b>Regulatory</b> <b>tax</b> Cost of regulation House prices Land use regulation...|$|E

The overall tax base and rate structure corroborates recent theoretical findings that heterogeneity in production processes and transaction costs may justify optimal departures from the Pigovian corrective tax rule.

Further improvements of the energy tax structure are also discussed, such as targeting the energy tax base and linking the tax rate more precisely to fuel characteristics.

40|$|The {{authors found}} that, in post-communist economies, the {{unofficial}} economy's share of GDP {{is determined by}} the extent of control rights held by bureaucrats and politicians. Exploring in detail the role of taxation and bribery, and using data from an expanded data set of 49 Latin American, OECD, and transition economies, the authors find that the unofficial economy accounts for a larger share of GDP where there is great bureaucratic inefficiency and discretion, and where firms experience a greater <b>tax</b> and <b>regulatory</b> burden, as well as more bribery and corruption. The unofficial economy is also much larger where there is less state revenue and where the rule of law is weak. They also find that countries with a larger unofficial economy tend to grow more slowly. Thus, this framework suggests an additional channel whereby corruption and ineffective <b>regulatory</b> and <b>tax</b> administration can result in lower growth: the unofficial economy. Wealthy OECD economies and some Eastern European economies find themselves the"good equilibrium"of relatively low <b>regulatory</b> and <b>tax</b> burden (not necessarily low statutory tax rates), sizable revenue mobilization, good rule of law and control of corruption, and a small unofficial economy. Several countries in Latin America and the former Soviet Union exhibit characteristics consistent with a"bad equilibrium": the discretionary application of heavy <b>regulatory</b> and <b>tax</b> burdens, the weakrule of law, heavy bribery, and an active unofficial economy. In this large country sample (unlike in the earlier framework for transition economies only), the authors find that it is the ineffective and discretionary application of <b>regulatory</b> and <b>tax</b> regimes in many countries [...] not higher tax rates by itself [...] that increase the size of the unofficial economy. The tax burden reported by firms appears to be more a function of regulatory and bureaucratic inefficiency and discretion rather than of tax rates alone.

40|$|AbstractThe {{theory of}} {{evolutionary}} variational inequalities fits {{very well in}} a lot of optimization problems, like for example the dynamic oligopolistic market equilibrium problem that we describe in this paper. But here, the authors analyze the behavior of control policies whose aim is to regulate the exportation through the adjustments of supply taxes or incentives on the firms. This is considered as a policy-maker optimization problem. This aspect is studied {{with the help of an}} inverse evolutionary variational formulation. Moreover, a characterization of the inverse variational inequality with an appropriate evolutionary variational inequality is given. Unlike the paper (Barbagallo & Mauro, 2013), here the authors explore the possibility of presence of production and demand excesses. Moreover, we provide a definition of equilibrium for the firms by using the infinite dimensional duality theory and later we define an optimal <b>regulatory</b> <b>tax.</b> Finally, we present a numerical scheme in order to compute the equilibrium solution of the inverse variational inequality that models the policy-maker's point of view for the dynamic oligopolistic market equilibrium problem in presence of excesses, then we provide a numerical example...|$|E

40|$|The high prevalences of {{antibodies}} against human T-cell leukemia (lymphotropic) virus type I (HTLV-I) {{reported for}} remote populations in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands {{and for some}} aboriginal populations in Australia have been verified by virus isolation. Limited genetic analysis of the transmembrane portion (gp 21) of the envelope gene of these viruses indicates the existence of highly divergent HTLV-I strains in Melanesia. Here, we report the complete nucleotide sequence of an HTLV-I isolate (designated HTLV-IMEL 5) from the Solomon Islands. The overall nucleotide divergence of HTLV-IMEL 5 from the prototype HTLV-IATK was approximately 8. 5 %. The degree of variability in the amino acid sequences of structural genes ranged between 3 and 11 % and was higher (8. 5 to 25 %) for the <b>regulatory</b> (<b>tax</b> and rex) genes and the other genes encoded by the pX region. Since HTLV-IMEL 5 was as distantly related to HTLV-II as to the other known HTLV-I strains, {{it could not have}} arisen from a reocmbinational event involving HTLV-II but rather might be an example of independent viral evolution in this remote population.

40|$|Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) and HTLV- 2 {{are complex}} retroviruses that {{persist in the}} host, {{eventually}} causing leukemia and neurological disease in {{a small percentage of}} infected individuals. In addition to structural and enzymatic proteins, HTLV encodes <b>regulatory</b> (<b>Tax</b> and Rex) and accessory (open reading frame I and II) proteins. The viral Tax and Rex proteins positively regulate virus production. Tax activates viral and cellular transcription to promote T-cell growth and, ultimately, malignant transformation. Rex acts posttranscriptionally to facilitate cytoplasmic expression of viral mRNAs that encode the structural and enzymatic gene products, thus positively controlling virion expression. Here, we report that both HTLV- 1 and HTLV- 2 have evolved accessory genes to encode proteins that act as negative regulators of both Tax and Rex. HTLV- 1 p 30 II and the related HTLV- 2 p 28 II inhibit virion production by binding to and retaining tax/rex mRNA in the nucleus. Reduction of viral replication in a cell carrying the provirus may allow escape from immune recognition in an infected individual.
