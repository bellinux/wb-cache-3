5|$|Most {{histories}} of professional Australian sculling commence with this event. By 1877, Australia had a vigorous interest in sport, and {{a class of}} professional athletes was emerging. Far from defeating him, the match of 30 June 1877 gave Rush new energy. After {{a year or two}} of retirement, he began to train and compete, mastering the sliding seat. He <b>regained</b> <b>his</b> Australian Championship in September 1881.|$|E

5|$|The {{struggle}} between Basiliscus and Zeno impeded the Eastern Roman Empire's ability {{to intervene in}} the fall of the Western Roman Empire, which happened in early September 476. When the chieftain of the Heruli, Odoacer, deposed Western Emperor Romulus Augustus, sending the imperial regalia to Constantinople, Zeno had just <b>regained</b> <b>his</b> throne, and he could only appoint Odoacer dux of Italy, thereby ending the Western Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, a highly {{unstable}} Osborn has partially <b>regained</b> <b>his</b> sanity {{with the help}} of anti-psychotic drugs. He comes to see Parker as the son he had always wanted and attempts to have Parker take on the Green Goblin mantle using physiological torture but ultimately fails. Osborn's next plan involves using a drunken Flash Thompson to drive a truck into Midtown High School, resulting in an accident that causes Thompson brain damage. This successfully enrages Parker into what Osborn anticipates will be a climactic battle. During this confrontation, an emotionally weary Parker tells Osborn he is tired of their constant battle, and declares a truce.|$|E

5|$|By 1972, Diefenbaker {{had grown}} disillusioned with Trudeau, and campaigned wholeheartedly for the Tories in that year's election. Diefenbaker was reelected comfortably {{in his home}} riding, and the Progressive Conservatives came within two seats of {{matching}} the Liberal total. Diefenbaker was relieved both that Trudeau had been humbled and that Stanfield had been denied power. Trudeau <b>regained</b> <b>his</b> majority two years later in an election that saw Diefenbaker, by then the only living former Prime Minister, have his personal majority grow to 11,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{left for}} the Eighth Crusade, led by Louis of France, in 1270, but Henry became {{increasingly}} ill; concerns about a fresh rebellion grew {{and the next year}} the King wrote to his son asking him to return to England, but Edward did not turn back. Henry recovered slightly and announced his renewed intention to join the crusades himself, but he never <b>regained</b> <b>his</b> full health and on the evening of 16 November 1272, Henry died in Westminster, probably with Eleanor in attendance. He was succeeded by Edward, who slowly made his way back to England via Gascony, finally arriving in August 1274.|$|E
5|$|In October 1899, he saw {{his first}} combat action when he led 300 Marines to take the town of Noveleta, from Filipino rebels known as Insurrectos. In the initial moments of the assault, his first {{sergeant}} was wounded. Butler briefly panicked, but quickly <b>regained</b> <b>his</b> composure and led his Marines {{in pursuit of the}} fleeing enemy. By noon the Marines had dispersed the rebels and taken the town. One Marine had been killed and ten were wounded. Another 50 Marines had been incapacitated by the humid tropical heat.|$|E

Karthik was rewarded with selection for South Zone, which represents the country’s south, in the Under-19 zonal competition. He was not a success with the bat, scoring 0, 1 and 2 in his 3 innings. In April 2002, Karthik was selected to play against the touring Australian Cricket Academy, and scored 125 in the second of two matches.|$|E

5|$|On the ground, Taylor's {{offensive}} scrambling, while effective, was not Virginia Tech's primary rushing weapon. Running back Brandon Ore, Virginia Tech's starter at the position, {{would need}} to have a good game, analysts predicted, if the Hokies wanted to win the game. Ore, who suffered several injuries during the 2006 season, failed to produce meaningful offensive yardage until late in the season, disappointing many fans who hoped he would repeat his excellent 2006performance on the field. With a 146-yard performance against Virginia in the final game of the regular season, Ore seemed to have <b>regained</b> <b>his</b> 2006form and promised success in the ACC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|Pantulf <b>regained</b> <b>his</b> lands {{after he}} cleared {{himself of the}} charge, through the {{mechanism}} of a trial by ordeal. It is not clear why the ordeal was required, with the historian David Bates speculating that either the evidence of Pantulf's involvement was not conclusive or that murder victim's family demanded the ordeal because they suspected any evidence pointing to Pantulf's innocence. Pantulf gave Saint-Evroul four altar frontals for the abbey's help after he was cleared of the charges.|$|E

5|$|Phase 2: Khalid, {{aware of}} the {{situation}} at the wings, ordered the cavalry of the right wing to attack the northern flank of the Byzantine left wing while he with his mobile guard attacked the southern flank of the Byzantine left wing, while the Muslim right wing infantry attacked from the front.

5|$|Since Humphrey (VI) {{was only}} {{sixteen years old}} at the time of his father's death, the Braose lands were taken into the king's custody until 1270. Part of this inheritance, the Marcher lordship of Brecon, was in the {{meanwhile}} given to the custody of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford. Humphrey technically <b>regained</b> <b>his</b> lordship from Clare in 1270, but by this time these lands had effectively been taken over by the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who had taken advantage of the previous decade's political chaos in England to extend his territory into the Marches.|$|E
5|$|The Bahamas did {{not come}} under {{external}} threat during Rogers' second term, but the reappointed governor had difficulties. Still seeking to bolster the island's defences, Rogers sought imposition of a local tax. The assembly, which had been instituted in Rogers' absence, objected, and Rogers responded by dissolving it. The governmental battle exhausted Rogers, who again went to Charleston in early 1731 {{in an attempt to}} recover his health. Though he returned in July 1731, he never truly <b>regained</b> <b>his</b> health, and died in Nassau on 15 July 1732.|$|E
