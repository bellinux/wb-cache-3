5000|$|The {{nature of}} applied {{psychology}} was too demanding for Walter Dill Scott {{to continue his}} research on human behavior, which lead his focus to establishing his own theories. Scott developed laws of suggestibility as a critical mechanism of advertising. He argued that consumers don't act rationally, and therefore can be easily influenced. According to Scott, consumer suggestibility was based on three factors: emotion, sympathy, and sentimentality. He believed that advertising was primarily a persuasive tool, rather than an informational device, and that advertising had its effect on consumers in a nearly hypnotic manner. People {{were thought to be}} highly susceptible to suggestion, as long as suggestion was available to them under a variety of conditions. Using his three parts of suggestibility, Scott advised companies to take on the [...] "direct command" [...] approach for advertising to consumers by using phrases such as [...] "Use Apple Computers." [...] Scott also recommended that companies use <b>return</b> <b>coupons</b> because they required consumers to take direct action. A 1903 article published in The New York Times suggested that Walter Dill Scott also advocated for the use of illustrations in advertisements. Illustrations attract reader attention, and must self-explanatory and relevant. This would then allow the reader to study the explanatory text of the advertisement. Scott said companies should also consider the circulation used and the tone the advertisement portrays to the audience. According to Scott, advertisements are utilized most effectively when large numbers of the right kind of people see them in a publication which adds confidence and recommends it favorably to prospective customers. Successful writers of advertisements had to possess technical knowledge, a creative imagination, and the ability to give precise descriptions of things.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{find and}} compare the levels of {{acceptance}} of and barriers to voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) among adults in two different counties of Guizhou province, China, {{one in which the}} China CARES project was operating and the other in which it was not. Design: A longitudinal design with two-stage cluster sampling was employed. Methods: A total of 1012 participants were recruited in the two counties. All participants were interviewed, then given a coupon for free VCT after the interview. Participants were paid for <b>returning</b> the <b>coupon</b> within 2 months, whether tested or not. The uptake of VCT was measured within 2 months after the interview. Results: The study found that the levels of HIV/AIDS knowledge and acceptability of VCT among the adults in both counties were low. Although 459 participants (43. 5 %) expressed an intent to use the VCT services, only 193 (16. 5 %) actually visited the VCT facilities, and only 42 (3. 7 %) actually took an HIV test within 2 months after the interview. The use of VCT was related to occupation, age, transportation difficulties, health status, ethnicity, and high-risk behaviors. The main barriers to HIV testing included perceiving oneself as low risk, fear of unsolicited disclosure, and fear of stigma and discrimination that would result from taking the test. Conclusion: Education about HIV/AIDS and VCT needs to be improved, and levels of stigma and discrimination reduced, in order to enhance the uptake of VCT services, an essential step for the initiation of treatment...|$|R
40|$|Can {{social media}} be an {{effective}} way for merchants to create new business? We believe {{that more and more}} businesses are using Social Media Promotions (SMPs) as an inexpensive way to market their business and/or new items to new, old and existing customers. We examined the effects of SMPs on businesses by surveying 111 customers and over 30 businesses. We found that customers mainly purchased a promotion to either try out a new place or enjoy the value of the deal. On the business side, we found that businesses have had a good experience with offering SMPs. Businesses can maintain profitability while offering a promotion via a social media site. The customer experience at the business is mostly the deciding factor in determining if they will <b>return</b> without the <b>coupon.</b> This study concludes that businesses were able to be successful offering discounts via a promotion on social media sites, such as Groupon and LivingSocial, as long as they follow some key steps in their strategy and prepare themselves for the positive and negative effects that they might experience.

40|$|An {{alternative}} powder prepregging {{method for}} use with LaRC-TPI (a thermoplastic polyimide) /graphite composites is investigated. The alternative method incorporates the idea of moistening the fiber prior to powder coating. Details of the processing parameters are given and discussed. The material was subsequently laminated into small coupons which were evaluated for processing defects using electron microscopy. After the initial evaluation of the material, no major processing defects were encountered but {{there appeared to be}} an interfacial adhesion problem. As a result, prepregging efforts were extended to include an additional fiber system, XAS, and a semicrystalline form of the matrix. The semicrystalline form of the matrix {{was the result of a}} complex heat treating cycle. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the fiber/matrix adhesion was evaluated in these systems relative to the amorphous/XAS coupons. Based on these results, amorphous and semicrystalline/AS- 4 and XAS materials were prepregged and laminated for transverse tensile testing. The results of these tests are presented, and in an effort to obtain more information on the effect of the matrix, remaining semicrystalline transverse tensile coupons were transformed back to the amorphous state and tested. The mechanical properties of the transformed <b>coupons</b> <b>returned</b> to the values observed for the original amorphous coupons, and the interfacial adhesion, as observed by SEM, was better than in any previous sample...|$|R
40|$|This paper shows that, {{contrary}} to the suggestion of some investment advisors, for an individual Canadian investor subject to personal income taxation, the after-tax return on a discount bond is always higher (or, at worse, equal) to the return on an otherwise identical premium bond. This follows because the tax rate on capital gains {{is lower than the}} tax rate on coupon income in Canada. It is also shown that a decline in the capital gains tax rate raises the after-tax yield on discount bonds, but reduces the after-tax yield on premium bonds, and may even cause the yield on premium bonds to become negative. Further, a cut in the tax rate on interest income raises the after-tax yield on all bonds, but raises the yield on premium bonds relative to discount bonds. While the lower after-tax <b>returns</b> on higher <b>coupon</b> bonds might be expected to cause the pre-tax yields on these bonds to rise, no evidence of such tax capitalization is found using a large dataset of matched pairs of Government of Canada bonds for the period 1986 - 2006. The observed near equality of pre-tax yields since 1995 for otherwise equivalent bonds with different coupons implies that individuals in Canada earn a significantly smaller after-tax return from holding premium bonds than discount bonds. The empirical analysis suggests that the marginal investor in the bond market is an investor who pays the same rate of tax on capital gains and interest income, such as professional investors, financial institutions or pension funds, rather than an individual taxpayer...|$|R
40|$|South Africa has a {{substantial}} HIV epidemic {{as well as}} a rising methamphetamine use problem, particularly in Cape Town. Respondent driven sampling (RDS) may be a useful tool for engaging vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations in HIV research, although its effectiveness has not yet been examined among South African methamphetamine users. The aim of the current study was to describe the effectiveness of RDS as a method for engaging methamphetamine users in Cape Town into a HIV behavioral research study. RDS procedures were used to screen 374 potential participants from a peri-urban township in Cape Town. Measures of homophily, equilibrium and RDS- 1 estimators were computed for key demographic and social variables. Beginning with 8 seeds, 345 methamphetamine users were enrolled over a 6 month period, with a <b>coupon</b> <b>return</b> rate of 67 %. The sample included 197 men and 148 women who were ethnically diverse (73 % Coloured, 27 % Black African) and had a mean age of 28. 8 years (SD= 7. 2). Social networks were adequate (mean network size > 5) and mainly comprised of close social ties. Equilibrium on race was reached after 11 waves of recruitment, and after ≤ 3 waves for all other variables of interest. There was little to moderate preference for either in- or out-group recruiting in all subgroups. Results suggest that RDS is an effective method for engaging methamphetamine users into HIV prevention research in South Africa. RDS may be a useful strategy for seeking high risk methamphetamine users for HIV testing and linkage to HIV care in this and other low resource settings. We also discuss future directions for RDS studies. Thesi...|$|R
40|$|Background: South Africa {{continues}} to witness {{an increase in}} illicit poly-substance use, although a precise measurement {{continues to}} be compounded by difficulties in accessing users. In a pilot attempt to use respondent-driven sampling (RDS) —a chain referral sampling method used to access populations of individuals who are ‘hard-to-reach’—this article documents the feasibility of the method as recorded in a simultaneously run, multisite, poly-substance study in Cape Town. Here we aim to a) document the piloting of RDS among poly-substance users in the three socio-economic disparate communities targeted; b) briefly document the results; and c) review the utility of RDS as a research tool. Methods: Three cross-sectional surveys using standard RDS procedures were used to recruit active poly-substance users and were concurrently deployed in three sites. Formative research was initially conducted to assess the feasibility of the survey. To determine whether RDS {{could be used to}} successfully recruit poly-substance users, social network characteristics, such as network size was determined. Results: A 42. 5 % <b>coupon</b> <b>return</b> rate was recorded in total from 12 initial seeds. There were vast differences in the recruitment chains of individual seeds—two generated more than 90 recruits, and 2 of the 10 recruitment chains showing a length of more than 10 waves. Findings include evidence of the use of 3 or more substances in all three sites, high levels of unemployment among users, with {{more than a third of}} participants in two sites reporting arrest for drug use in the past 12 months. Conclusions: Our results indicate that RDS was a feasible and acceptable sampling method for recruiting participants who may not otherwise be accessible. Future studies can use RDS to recruit such cohorts, and the method could form part of broader efforts to document vulnerable populations...|$|R
40|$|An {{examination}} of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC- 2) radiator assembly was conducted at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) {{during the summer of}} 2009. Immediately apparent was the predominance of impact features resident only in the thermal paint layer; similar phenomenology was observed during a prior survey of the WFPC- 1 radiator. As well, larger impact features displayed spallation zones, darkened areas, and other features not encountered in impacts onto bare surfaces. Whereas the characterization of impact features by depth and diameter on unpainted surfaces has been long established, the mitigation provided by the painted layer presented a challenge to further analysis of the WFPC- 2 features; a literature search revealed no systematic characterization of the ballistic limit equations of painted or coated surfaces. In order to characterize the impactors responsible for the observed damage, an understanding of the cratering and spallation phenomenology of the painted surface was required. To address that challenge, NASA sponsored a series of hypervelocity calibration shots at the White Sands Test Facility (WSTF). This effort required the following activities: the production, painting, and artificial ageing of test coupons {{in a manner similar to}} the actual radiator; the determination of the test matrix parameters projectile diameter and material (mass density), impact velocity, and impact angle, so as to enable both an adequate characterization of the impact by projectile and impact geometry and support hydrocode modeling to fill in and extend the applicability of the calibration shots; the selection of suitable projectiles; logistics; and an analysis of feature characteristics upon <b>return</b> of the <b>coupons.</b> This paper reports the results of the test campaign and presents ballistic limit equations for painted surfaces.

40|$|People who inject drugs (PWID) {{are greatly}} {{affected}} by blood borne viruses (BBV). Behavioural surveillance, {{which consists of}} ongoing cross-sectional surveys of at-risk populations, is a core component of BBV prevention. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) {{is a relatively new}} sampling method, developed to sample hard-to-reach populations, such as PWID. This thesis aimed to describe the role of RDS in the behavioural surveillance of PWID. An RDS study of PWID was conducted in 2009 in Sydney, Australia. Five seeds were selected to start the recruitment, which led to a sample of 261 participants over 16 waves. To achieve the thesis aim, I examined the benefits and challenges of conducting RDS with minimal and existing resources, the ability to use RDS data to calculate unbiased population estimates, the characteristics of the RDS study&# 146;s sample as compared with those from separate service-based sampling studies, and whether RDS network data can add to the usefulness of a behavioural surveillance system. While there were benefits to conducting RDS with existing resources, there were also challenges related to crowd control and privacy issues. An examination of RDS requirements and assumptions found a lack of random recruitment and a low proportion of <b>coupons</b> <b>returned,</b> which suggested that population estimates were biased. In a comparison of RDS participants with participants from two separate service-based sampling studies, no marked differences in demographics or risk practices were found. As well, compared to pharmacy-based sampling, RDS was 80 % less likely to capture participants with small injecting networks, a group found to be of interest to behavioural surveillance. Finally, using the network information gathered through RDS, it was found that closeness, Aboriginal origin status and hepatitis C testing were related to sharing injecting equipment within dyads, which were formed by linking participants&# 146; information with that of their recruiter. The results indicate that in locations where there is good coverage by services for PWID, RDS should be best viewed as a complementary tool, where it can be used on an intermittent basis to evaluate existing sampling methods and to add to the understanding of how network characteristics shape risk practices...|$|R
