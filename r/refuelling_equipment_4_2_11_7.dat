5000|$|Although online {{refuelling}} {{is generally}} desirable, it requires design compromises {{which means that}} it is often uneconomical. This includes added complexity to <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment,</b> and the requirement for these to pressurise during refuelling gas and water-cooled reactors. Online <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment</b> for Magnox reactors proved to be less reliable than the reactor systems, and retrospectively its use {{was regarded as a}} mistake. [...] Molten salt reactors and pebble bed reactors also require online handling and processing equipment to replace the fuel during operation.|$|R

50|$|With the {{changeover}} of traction from {{steam to}} diesel and electric locomotives, a comprehensive reorganisation of Bahnbetriebswerke was necessary. Sites {{that were only}} needed {{for the maintenance of}} steam locomotives no longer had any significance. And whilst for the servicing of electric locomotives, hardly any special installations were necessary apart from the erection of catenary in the Bw, the most important measure for the stabling of diesel locomotives was the installation of <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like the Windscale designs, the Magnox {{reactors}} allowed {{access to}} the fuel channels and could be refuelled while operating. This was a key criterion for the design because its use of natural uranium leads to low burnup ratios and the requirement for frequent refuelling. For power use, the fuel canisters were left in the reactor as long as possible, while for plutonium production they were removed earlier. The complicated <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment</b> proved to be less reliable than the reactor systems, and perhaps not advantageous overall.|$|R

[...] The first four aircraft had been built for Western Airlines, but that order was subsequently cancelled; the fifth was bought separately a year later. To fulfil Canada's requirements for aerial refueling, two aircraft were fitted with Beechcraft made probe and drogue refueling pods in 1972.

50|$|A {{total of}} four flying S.30 series flying boats - Cabot, Caribou, Clyde and Connemara - were {{equipped}} with in-flight <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment</b> and extra fuel tanks in order {{that they could be}} used to provide a regular trans-atlantic airmail service. The concept was for the aircraft to take off at lower weights and, once airborne, take on extra fuel to reach an all up weight of 53000 lb, giving the aircraft a range of over 2500 mi. The extra fuel reduced the payload to 4270 lb against the 6250 lb of the standard aeroplane. The refuelling was performed by three converted Handley Page Harrow bombers, one operating out of Ireland and two out of Newfoundland.|$|R
500|$|The {{decision}} {{to proceed with}} the B.2 versions of the Vulcan was made in May 1956. It was anticipated that the first B.2 would be around the 45th aircraft of the 99 then on order. As well as being able to achieve greater heights over targets, it was believed that operational flexibility could be extended by the provision of in-flight <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment</b> and tanker aircraft. The increasing sophistication of Soviet air defences required the fitting of electronic countermeasure (ECM) equipment and vulnerability could be reduced by the introduction of the Avro Blue Steel stand-off missile, then in development. In order to develop these proposals, the second Vulcan prototype VX777 was rebuilt with the larger and thinner phase 2C wing, improved flying control surfaces and Olympus 102 engines, first flying in this configuration in August 1957. Plans were in hand to equip all Vulcans from the 16th aircraft onwards with in-flight <b>refuelling</b> receiving <b>equipment.</b> A B.1, XA903, was allocated for Blue Steel development work. [...] Other B.1s were used {{for the development of the}} BOl.6 (later Olympus 200), XA891; a new AC electrical system, XA893; and ECM including jammers within a bulged tail-cone and a tail warning radar, XA895.|$|R
50|$|Basic groundcrewman {{aircraft}} support training {{consists of}} three individual courses, totalling approximately 19 weeks. The first course conducted is a basic drivers course where soldiers gain qualifications in operating the Army Landrover 110 and Unimog truck. This lasts for 38 days and is held at Puckapunyal in Victoria. The next course to be completed is the two-week bulk fuel tanker course held at the Army Logistic Training Centre at Bandiana in Victoria. This course involves instruction in operating bulk and portable <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment</b> and fuel quality control. The final course, and longest in duration at 9 to 12 weeks is the forward arming and refuelling course, held at the Oakey Army Aviation Centre in Queensland. Here soldiers are taught aircraft refuelling and arming operation both in the barracks and field environment.|$|R
50|$|The two X-47B demonstrators were {{initially}} {{planned to have}} a three-year test program with 50 tests at Edwards AFB and NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, culminating in sea trials in 2013. However, the aircraft performed so consistently that the preliminary tests stopped after 16 flights. Thereafter, the Navy {{decided to use the}} aircraft to demonstrate carrier launches and recoveries, as well as autonomous inflight refueling with a probe and drogue. In November 2011, the Navy announced that aerial <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment</b> and software would be added to one of the prototype aircraft in 2014 for testing. The Navy also affirmed that the demonstrator aircraft would never be armed. In 2012, Northrop Grumman tested a wearable remote control system, designed to allow ground crews to steer the X-47B while on the carrier deck.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, 14 former BA Super VC10s were {{purchased}} and stored for spare parts. In the early 1990s, {{to help the}} VC10 fleet replace the recently retired Handley Page Victor tankers, five of the stored aircraft were converted to VC10 K4 tankers. Shortly after entering service, extensive wing plank corrosion was discovered on the lower wing surfaces; this was attributed mainly to the storage method used prior to conversion, the wing tanks had been defuelled and filled with water as ballast. Extensive wing plank corrosion rectification work, including plank replacement, often took place during major services. The K4 conversions, as with the K2, lacked forward freight doors, thus {{it was decided that}} there would be no internal refuelling tanks fitted. The K4 has identical <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment</b> to the K2 and K3, but lacks the extra fuselage fuel tanks and retains the same fuel capacity as a Super VC10.|$|R
5000|$|McLaren {{were also}} {{concerned}} about the standard <b>refuelling</b> <b>equipment</b> provided for 1995 by suppliers Intertechnique, having suffered a major leak in a test of the new rig outside of its factory. Intertechnique had redesigned the fuel equipment, which was used by all of the teams, {{in the wake of a}} pit lane fire suffered by driver Jos Verstappen during the previous year's German Grand Prix. The new fuel rigs, in addition to being half the size of the 1994, also featured longer nozzles, and were designed to lock onto the car before any fuel could begin to flow. Intertechnique traced the problem to a faulty valve within the equipment, which caused 10 kg of fuel to leak, and modified the parts accordingly. [...] It was only the seventeenth race since refuelling had been reintroduced to the sport at the start of the 1994 season.|$|R

Building on existing work in user-experience and Kurosu’s framework for user-experience design and evaluation, we developed a method for testing people’s experience of video content with added programmable controlled surround lighting. We employed simple video content to evoke a response of positive or negative affect. Using a repeated-measures design (N = 33), we manipulated the colour of surround lighting to enhance the affect response (yellow and green for positive affect; red and purple for negative affect) and then tested the benefits of added surround lighting. Yellow surround colour enhanced positive affect in response to video content and red surround colour enhanced negative affect. There was evidence of assimilation effects as a result of alternating coloured (e. g., yellow) and white surround lighting on affect. This work has implications for the choice of surround lighting colour to enhance user-experience, research design and substantive future research.

40|$|Mobile {{payment is}} one of the {{telematics}} programs that the Taiwan Government focuses on. In accompany to the governmental sponsored program {{on the development of the}} mobile payment service, several legal issues are being raised on; for example, challenges on lacking of an adequate definition on the mobile payment with its technological characteristics; the interests of the stakeholders under existing legal advantages; and the fairness of the market competition between the telecommunication and the banking service providers. Moreover, this dissertation aims to help legislature to foresee the future possible payment methods other than mobile payment service and to bring up key issues that the legislature shall be concerned of and included in the future legislation or amendment. Moreover, this dissertation provides a review and comparison in legislative intent in the European Union and the United States. By examining regulations in the EU, the US and the current regulations of stored-value card and electronic monetary card in Taiwan, significant legal objectives relating to the mobile payment is being summarized. Also, this dissertation suggests that protection of law and order could be transferred limitedly to self-discipline and self-regulation of the enterprises under the concept of lasser-faire. 行動支付是國家在未來資通服務中欲嘗試推動及協助廠商的範疇之ㄧ，隨著科技的新穎、使用普遍性及生意模式的樣態變化，行動支付也繁衍出許多的法律問題，如法律上對於行動支付的定義是否符合該技術特徵的性質歸屬；行動支付究竟屬於金融服務或電信服務的業務範圍；銀行業者如何在既有的法律優勢下阻擾電信業者參與市場競爭的實質公平性問題；及立法者應否針對諸如行動支付等未來的支付服務方式進行相關立法或修法等均值得討論。 文中也介紹歐盟及美國相關法律，並就我國現行法律中關於行動支付與儲值卡或電子票證之類比問題進行深度討論。本文認為法律應以經營模式賦予行動支付相關保護，讓電信業者與銀行業者相互公平競爭，並儘量讓業者落實自我監督之自由企業概念。Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION	 1 1. 1 Research Background	 2 1. 1. 1 Initiative of Telematic Service and ITAS	 2 1. 1. 2 Development Telematics in Taiwan	 6 1. 2 Research Purpose	 9 1. 3 Research Methods	 10 1. 4 Research Framework	 10 Chapter 2 INFRASTRUCTURE OF MOBILE PAYMENT IN THE BUSINESS TRANSACTION	 13 2. 1 Mobile Payment Characteristics	 14 2. 2 Mobile Payment Solutions	 16 2. 2. 1 Bank Account based Mobile Payment	 16 2. 2. 2 Credit Card based Mobile Payment	 16 2. 2. 3 Telecommunication Company Billing of Mobile Payments	 17 2. 3 Technologies for Mobile Payments	 17 2. 3. 1 Short Message Service (SMS) 	 18 2. 3. 2 Unstructured Supplementary Service Delivery	 19 2. 3. 3 WAP/GPRS	 20 <b>2.</b> 3. <b>4</b> Phone-based Application (J 2 ME/BREW) 	 20 2. 3. 5 SIM-based Application	 21 2. 3. 6 Near Field Communication (NFC) 	 22 2. 3. 7 Dual Chip	 22 2. 3. 8 Mobile Wallet	 23 <b>2.</b> <b>4</b> A Generic Architecture of Mobile Payment System	 24 2. 5 Existing M-Commerce Cases	 26 2. 5. 1 Paybox	 27 2. 5. 1. 1 Payment Scheme	 27 2. 5. 1. 2 Characteristics of the Paybox Business Model	 28 2. 5. 2 Mobipay	 30 2. 5. 2. 1 Payment Scheme	 30 2. 5. 2. 2 Characteristics of the Paybox Business Model	 32 2. 5. 3 TeliaSonera Shopper	 33 2. 5. 3. 1 Payment Scheme	 33 2. 5. 3. 2 Characteristics of the Sonera Business Model	 35 <b>2.</b> 5. <b>4</b> M-Pay	 36 <b>2.</b> 5. <b>4.</b> 1 Payment Scheme	 37 <b>2.</b> 5. <b>4.</b> <b>2</b> Characteristics of the M-Pay Business Model	 38 2. 5. 5 NTT DoCoMo	 39 2. 5. 5. 1 Payment Scheme	 40 2. 5. 5. 2 Characteristics of the M-Pay Business Model	 42 2. 5. 6 M-PESA	 44 2. 5. 6. 1 Payment Scheme	 44 2. 5. 6. 2 Characteristics of the M-PESA Business Model	 46 2. 6 Synthesis	 47 Chapter 3 LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO MOBILE PAYMENT ISSUES IN THE E.
