40|$|Abstract- Parallel {{operation}} {{is an effective}} way to improve the capacity of <b>full</b> <b>power</b> converter in permanent-magnet directdrive (PMDD) wind power generation system. But it causes the zero-sequence circulating-current (ZSCC), which brings current discrepancy, current waveform distortion, power losses, and electromagnetic interference (EMI), etc. The paper proposes a new topology of <b>full</b> <b>power</b> converters which are composed of n <b>full</b> <b>power</b> converters. The n converters have the same structures and are in parallel with each other. Besides, the average models of the system are analyzed and the fundamental mechanism of ZSCC generation is given. Based on the above analysis, the control strategy of the system is designed. The simulation and experiment results of two parallel <b>full</b> <b>power</b> converters show the feasibility of the proposed theory and control scheme.

50|$|Siemens Corporation {{developed}} {{two ways}} in powering these old coal plants. The {{first one is}} called a <b>Full</b> <b>Powering</b> {{and the second is}} called Parallel <b>Powering.</b> <b>Full</b> <b>Powering</b> is only used with old plants because the boilers has reached the life of its usage. <b>Full</b> <b>powering</b> replaces the original boiler and gas-turbine (GT) and heat recovery steam generator are added (HRSG). While compared to the full repowering concept, this repowering scheme achieves slightly lower efficiency. Due to the two independent steam sources for the steam turbine, this concept provides a higher fuel flexibility and also greater flexibility in respect to load variations.|$|R
