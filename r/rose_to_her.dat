25|$|The Doctor {{returns to}} the {{remaining}} guests and Rose, who is now free of the observation room. Using a device he finds in the room, the Doctor reverses Cassandra's teleport and brings her back onto the station. In the elevated temperature and without moisturising, Cassandra begins to dry out and crack. She begs for mercy from the Doctor, but he refuses to listen and Cassandra ruptures. Rose notes that with all the events that occurred no one had witnessed the actual destruction of Earth. The Doctor returns <b>Rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> present time, and explains {{to her that he}} is the last of the Time Lords, and that his planet of Gallifrey was destroyed {{in the wake of a}} great war. The episode closes with Rose and the Doctor going off to get chips on a sunny London afternoon.|$|E
500|$|The Ninth Doctor {{appears in}} the first six of the Doctor Who {{hardback}} New Series Adventures novels which tie in with the first series of the revamped show. The first three of these novels— The Clockwise Man, The Monsters Inside and Winner Takes All—were published on 19 May 2005 and feature solely the Doctor and Rose. The Monsters Inside depicts the Doctor taking <b>Rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> first alien planet, Justicia. Rose mentions the visit to Justicia in the first series episode [...] "Boom Town" [...] which aired 4 June 2005 in an example of the television series referencing the novels. The second batch of Ninth Doctor novels—comprising The Deviant Strain, Only Human and The Stealers of Dreams—were released 8 September 2005 and feature the Doctor, Rose and later companion Captain Jack. All of the Ninth Doctor novels except Only Human make reference to the [...] "Bad Wolf" [...] story arc of the first series although in keeping with the TV series, the Doctor does not acknowledge these as significant. The Ninth Doctor appeared in the Penguin Fiftieth Anniversary eBook novella The Beast of Babylon by Charlie Higson. Here it is shown that he had adventures between dematerialising near the end of [...] "Rose" [...] and re-materializing to tell Rose the TARDIS travels in time.|$|E
500|$|Lead {{writer and}} {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies chose the name Rose because he considered it a [...] "good luck charm" [...] after he used it for Lesley Sharp's character in Bob & Rose. His desire to make the show [...] "essentially British" [...] was another justification: he considered Rose to be [...] "the most British name in the world" [...] and feminine enough to subvert a recent trend of female companions having [...] "boyish" [...] names, such as Peri, Benny, Charley, and Ace. Davies also frequently uses the surname [...] "Tyler" [...] in his work—previous characters he created with the surname include Ruth Tyler in Revelations (1994), Vince Tyler in Queer as Folk (1999), and Johnny Tyler in The Second Coming (2003)—due to his affection for how the surname is spelled and pronounced. The casting of Piper as Rose was announced on by the BBC on 24 May 2004. Head of Drama for BBC Wales Julie Gardner commented that the former pop star [...] "fits the bill perfectly" [...] as a [...] "unique, dynamic partner for Christopher Eccleston". Whilst some fans—including {{a representative of the}} Doctor Who Appreciation Society—were enthusiastic about the announcement, others felt it was [...] "publicity stunt" [...] casting and questioned Piper's acting credentials. One of the factors that influenced Piper's acceptance of the role was {{that she was able to}} relate the character of <b>Rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own experiences as a teenager.|$|E

2500|$|Fergus {{tried to}} get the 'Maol' cow to rise and walk but she refused to get up. [...] His men {{believed}} that the Maol was in grief and sorrow due to the death of her Master. [...] Fergus lost his temper then and prodded the Maol with his sword. [...] When she still refused to get up, he beat her nine rhythmic blows across her back. [...] She bellowed and lowed so loudly that her agonies could be heard for many miles around. [...] Still the cow did not get up on her feet. [...] Bricne came then and said that he could make the 'Maol' get up if he got enough gifts and payment in return for that favour. [...] Fergus agreed to that and the Maol <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> feet and led the captured herds away from Erris on the long journey towards Cruachan.|$|E
2500|$|Both Heather and Mae West {{became the}} focus of Fred's incestuous sexual attentions after Anna Marie ran away from home at age 15 in 1979 after {{enduring}} a particularly severe beating from <b>Rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> stomach just days after being discharged from hospital for treatment of an ectopic pregnancy. The frequency of the abuse endured by Heather and Mae increased when both girls hit puberty. Fred was both overt and unapologetic in his conduct, and would justify his actions with the simple explanation: [...] "I made you; I can do what I like with you." [...] He would further refer to his intentions to impregnate both his daughters on at least one occasion, and would occasionally force all his children to watch pornography with him. As Heather, Mae and their younger brother Stephen were very close in age, the trio resolved that if their father asked either of the two girls to be alone in a room with him, they would only do so if at least one other member of the trio were present to avoid either girl being raped. In addition, both girls developed a regime whereby they would only shower or undress when their father was either out of the house, or as her sister stood guard at the door. Stephen himself was also informed by his father he would have to have sex with his mother by the age of 17 (although his parents would evict him from their home at age 16).|$|E
