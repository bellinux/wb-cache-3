5|$|Since 1998, an American botanist, Austin Mast, {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae.

5|$|The olive baboon {{lives in}} groups of 15 to 150, {{made up of a}} few males, many females, and their young.

Female relatives form their own subgroups in the troop. Related females are largely friendly to each other.

Female kin form these strong bonds because they do not emigrate from their natal groups.|$|E

5|$|A minimum term {{of service}} of 25 years was established, {{at the end}} of which the {{retiring}} auxiliary soldier, and all his children, were awarded Roman citizenship. This is deduced from the fact that the first known Roman military diplomas date from the time of Claudius. This was a folding bronze tablet engraved with the details of the soldier's service record, which he could use to prove his citizenship. Claudius also decreed that prefects of auxiliary regiments must all be of equestrian rank, thus excluding centurions from such commands. The fact that auxiliary commanders were now all of the same social <b>rank</b> <b>as</b> most tribuni militum, (military tribunes, a legion's senior staff officers, all of whom only one, the tribunus laticlavius, was of the higher senatorial rank), probably indicates that auxilia now enjoyed greater prestige. Indigenous chiefs continued to command some auxiliary regiments, and were probably granted equestrian rank for the purpose. It is also likely that auxiliary pay was standardised at this time, but we only have estimates for the Julio-Claudian period.|$|E
