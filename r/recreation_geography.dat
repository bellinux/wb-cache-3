40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to prepare a visitor {{economic}} expenditure study for the 1999 Eastern States Exposition, better known as the Big E. The study was executed as part of a class project in <b>Recreation</b> <b>Geography</b> offered the Fall 1999 semester at Westfield State College. The students undertook an economic expenditure study at the Big E by studying tourism economics, executing the visitor exit surveys, and evaluating the responses...|$|E

40|$|John N. Jackson {{was born}} and raised in London England. He served in the Royal Navy, {{acquired}} a B. A. and a Ph. D, conducted research for a city planning office and lectured at the University of Manchester. He joined Brock Universityâ€™s faculty in 1965 as a Professor of Applied Geography. Since his retirement in 1991 he has been Professor Emeritus to Brock. 	Throughout his time in academia Jackson has focused his research on the history of the modern city, both throughout Europe and Canada. Jackson has also completed specific research on the Niagara Peninsula; including industrial <b>geography,</b> <b>recreation</b> along the Lake Erie shore, St. Catharines early history, the Welland Canals, railway development, comparisons across the Niagara River. 	While living in the Niagara region Jackson has become involved in many community events. He has been the Director for the Bruce Trail Association, President of the Welland Canals Foundation, and been involved in local historical groups throughout the Niagara region. Fonds contains photographs related to the publication Recreational Development and the Lake Erie Shore. The photographs have been arranged to correspond with the page on which they appear in the book. Pages are marked as the page before the actual photographs, as the pages containing photographs are not numbered. Photographs from pages 43 and 225 are missing. Also some miscellaneous photographs and negatives are included...|$|R
40|$|Long span {{bridges and}} high rise {{buildings}} {{are two types}} of structures that have always arisen the atten-tion of engineers and architects. The former are appropriate for creating crossings over wide rivers or estuaries in a sort of <b>recreation</b> of the <b>geography</b> of our planet. The latter are many times used to be a symbol of the wealthy of the cities where they are erected. Construction of both typologies has experienced a dramatic activity since the last decades of the past century in many countries located in different continents such as Europe, Asia or America, and such tendency has even increased in recent years, and several challenging proposals have also been proposed for the years to come. This article starts with {{a brief description of the}} capabilities and advantages of long span bridges and tall buildings. Afterwards, a description of the main realizations of suspension and cable-stayed bridges already existing all around the world is presented mentioning their main characteristics and fea-tures. Additionally, information on bridge projects that could take place in a near future are mentioned. Then, a similar treatment is carried out for the vast collection of signature buildings erected in the last decades. It will be observed that in addition to the new tall structures in already very cosmopolitan cit-ies, many of them have been built in other places and have transformed radically the skyline of cities in China, Singapore, Korea or the Arabic Gulf countries, to name a few...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{treating}} these models {{here is to}} indicate {{the wide range of}} situations in which integrated environmental models (abbreviated as IEMs) have been applied in the past ten years (e. g., in water resource management models, land use planning models, agricultural, regional and urban planning, as well as ecosystem management planning models). Fourteen integrated environmental models will be discussed. This is a small but fairly representative sample of models which have actually been operationalized. The next chapter evaluates the strong and weak points of each of these models. The models originate from various countries with different fields of application, and use various mathematical tools for integrating the successive modules. Examples of such mathematical tools are, among others, optimization, simulation and evaluation techniques. An exhaustive survey of IEMs is given by Braat and van Lierop (1984). Such models are characterized by a multidisciplinary approach to environmentally relevant phenomena originating from different disciplines. There are links - either direct and/or indirect - between various constituent modules which have their background in different disciplines such as (regional) economics, ecology, demography, <b>recreation,</b> <b>geography</b> etc. In the sequel of this chapter, a module will be interpreted as a set of interrelated - often monodisciplinary oriented - variables which have their background in a specific, identifiable part of a compound environmental phenomenon...|$|E
