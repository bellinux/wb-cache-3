The 6th Massachusetts marched through the city to Federal Hill, where they set up camp for a short stay of three days. On May 16, the regiment returned to the Elkridge <b>relay</b> <b>station.</b> They served out the majority of their term at the <b>relay</b> <b>station</b> and vicinity, except for a second assignment in Baltimore from June 26 to July 1, 1861.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Mobile WiMAX {{networks}} are generally {{based on the}} 802. 16 e standard. This version of standard supports a number of handover types and allows full mobility of users. However, the <b>relay</b> <b>stations</b> are not considered in this standard version. <b>Relay</b> <b>stations</b> are introduced in the originating 802. 16 j standard version. This paper deals {{with the impact of}} <b>relay</b> <b>stations</b> implementation from the handover point of view. The influences of fixed <b>relay</b> <b>stations</b> amount on the number of handover procedure initializations and on the diversity set size are investigated...|$|R

The low temperature of the crater floor makes it ideal for infrared observations, and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near-continuous power to the observatory. About 120 kilometers from the crater lies the 5-km tall Malapert Mountain, a peak that is perpetually visible from the Earth, and which {{could serve as a}} radio <b>relay</b> <b>station</b> when suitably equipped.|$|E

5|$|Following {{months of}} rumours, in October 2013 a BBC press conference {{announced}} {{the return of}} 11 episodes (two of which previously existing) from a television <b>relay</b> <b>station</b> {{in the city of}} Jos, Nigeria. In the course of his work abroad, Philip Morris of Television International Enterprises Archives had discovered episodes 1-6 of The Enemy of the World and episodes 1-6 of The Web of Fear. and returned 11 of these to the BBC. The return of the nine missing episodes was the single largest recovery of Doctor Who episodes in 25 years, resulting in only the second full serial from Troughton's first two seasons to be restored to the BBC.|$|E

5|$|Brody {{runs into}} Mike, who tells {{his father that}} Sean is with his friends, {{drifting}} towards Cable Junction, a small island housing an electrical <b>relay</b> <b>station,</b> and apologizes for disobeying him and putting Sean in danger. Brody accepts his apology while telling him to get to safety and quickly finds them, but when the shark returns, he panics and maroons the police boat on Cable Junction. He then tries to pull them in with a winch but hooks an underwater power cable. The shark's next attack sends most of the teenagers into the water, and they swim to Cable Junction while Sean and Jackie are trapped on the boats. Using an inflatable raft, Brody hits the power cable with an oar to attract the shark, and encourages it to bite the cable; the shark is fatally electrocuted, and its body sinks {{to the bottom of}} the sea. The kids rejoice as Brody picks up Sean and Jackie, and they join them on Cable Junction to await rescue.|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”In {{cellular}} networks, mobile {{users in}} hot cells may suffer from low throughput {{due to the}} load imbalance problem. Different approaches such as channel borrowing and cell breathing have been proposed to accommodate this problem. Meanwhile, <b>relay</b> <b>stations,</b> which can extend cell coverage and enhance signal strength for boundary users, appear to be impor-tant components in next generation networks. In this paper, we propose a new relay-based load balancing scheme which utilizes <b>relay</b> <b>stations</b> to transfer over-loaded traffic from hot cells to neighboring cooler cells. The proposed algorithm dynamically controls the associations of <b>relay</b> <b>stations</b> to base stations, and the associations of mobile users to <b>relay</b> <b>stations</b> and base stations. Simulation results show that our scheme significantly improves the performance of boundary users without penalizing total system throughput. 1 I...|$|R

The East Asian <b>Relay</b> <b>Station</b> moved to Thailand in 1997 when Hong Kong was handed over to Chinese sovereignty. Together, these facilities have given the BBC World Service an easily accessible signal in regions where shortwave listening has traditionally been popular.
