The company soon faced a number of violent protests, as its employees wanted better working conditions, better pay and <b>resettlement</b> <b>benefits.</b> By October 2008, it was operating at half the capacity, withholding further investments until the government finally agreed to give the company a lenient tax status.|$|E

(10) The {{affected}} Scheduled Tribes, {{other traditional}} forest dwellers and the Scheduled Castes having fishing rights {{in a river}} or pond or dam in the affected area shall be given fishing rights in the reservoir area of the irrigation or hydel projects. (11) Where the affected families belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes are relocated outside of the district, then, they shall be paid an additional twenty-five per cent, rehabilitation and <b>resettlement</b> <b>benefits</b> {{to which they are}} entitled in monetary terms along with a one-time entitlement of fifty thousand rupees.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} ‘resettlement’ {{is to help}} prisoners deal with {{problems}} that have contributed to their offending. These can include issues such as health, education, criminal attitudes, relationships and employment. Resettlement services are therefore {{an important part of}} helping to reduce re-offending behaviours and it is a considerable challenge for the Northern Ireland Prison Service (NIPS) to deliver them effectively. This inspection is a follow-up to the last report on the Northern Ireland Prisoner Resettlement Strategy completed in 2007. The inspection report shows the <b>resettlement</b> process has <b>benefitted</b> from the resources that were provided to implement the Criminal Justice Order. Improvements have been identified in relation to the appointment of additional staff, co-located offender management teams that were working well together, a better environment for some life sentence prisoners, better engagement with the voluntary and community sector and greater effort to address the resettlement needs of short-term and remand prisoners. Whilst the resettlement process had improved, better outcomes for prisoners were less obvious. This was partly a reflection of the NIPS inclination to measure inputs rather than outcomes which are the real test of whether services are being delivered successfully. In addition the successful delivery of resettlement remained hampered by working practices within the Service and its dominant security ethos. Every aspect of prisoner life contributes to the resettlement agenda and {{it is important that the}} Strategic Efficiency and Effectiveness (SEE) programme currently being developed by the Prison Service to enable reform, explicitly deals with the resettlement agenda. Our recommendations for change need to be folded into the reform agenda...|$|R
50|$|This was {{encouraged}} by the Trans-Siberian Railroad Committee, which was personally headed by Tsar Nicholas II. The Stolypin agrarian reforms included <b>resettlement</b> <b>benefits</b> for peasants who moved to Siberia. An emigration department was created in 1906 at the ministry of agriculture. It organized resettlement and assisted the settlers during their first years in the new settlements. The settlers received on average 16.5 hectares of land per man. The total area allocated was 21 million hectares. Migrants received a small state subsidy, exemption from some taxes, and advice from state agencies specifically developed to help with peasant resettlement.|$|E
50|$|The 2013 Act {{focuses on}} {{providing}} not only compensation {{to the land}} owners, but also extend rehabilitation and <b>resettlement</b> <b>benefits</b> to livelihood looser from the land, which shall be {{in addition to the}} minimum compensation. The minimum compensation to be paid to the land owners is based on a multiple of market value and other factors laid down in the Act. The Act forbids or regulates land acquisition when such acquisition would include multi-crop irrigated area. The Act changed the norms for acquisition of land for use by private companies or in case of public-private partnerships, including compulsory approval of 80% of the landowners. The Act also introduced changes in the land acquisition process, including a compulsory social-impact study, which need to be conducted before an acquisition is made.|$|E
40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} the National Open Apprenticeship Scheme on youth employment in Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State, Nigeria. Data were collected with the aid of the structured questionnaire administered to 120 randomly selected youths in the study area. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The results revealed high (79. 2 %) level of awareness and high (84. 2 %) level of participation by respondents in the scheme. More participation by the respondents in the scheme were on catering with 11. 3 % response and welding and fabrication with 10. 0 % response. Socio-economic effect of the scheme was more on employment generation with 87. 5 % response. Major problems of respondents in the scheme were, exclusion of some participants from <b>resettlement</b> <b>benefits</b> which accounted for 76. 3 % of the problem and insufficient resettlement package which accounted for 71. 3 % of the problem. Increasing the number of participants to benefit from the scheme’s resettlement package and improving the content of the resettlement package are recommended...|$|E
40|$|Temporary {{protection}} {{programs can}} provide haven to endangered persons while states and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) work to create durable solutions in sending, host and third countries. [1] They {{have the potential}} to further the interests of forced migrants in protection, states in effective and coordinated migration management, and the international community in solidarity. US temporary protection programs rest primarily on executive discretion and have not been substantially revisited for nearly 25 years. “Parole” represents the primary vehicle for temporarily admitting non-citizens for emergency and humanitarian reasons. [2]   Prior to 1980, the United States used parole to admit large refugee and refugee-like populations to whom (in most cases) it later extended lawful permanent resident (LPR) status. The 1980 Refugee Act made the US refugee resettlement program the primary vehicle for refugee admissions, limited the use of parole to individuals (not groups), and created a presumption against granting parole to refugees. The United States provides immigrant (permanent) visas to abused, neglected and abandoned children, as well as to certain Iraqis and Afghanis who worked for the US military or for military contractors.  It can also award up to 5, 000 non-immigrant (temporary) “T” visas each year to victims of human trafficking and up to 10, 000 non-immigrant “U” visas to survivors of crime who assist law enforcement officials in investigating and prosecuting crimes. However, since 1980, the United States has lacked a dedicated legal vehicle for admitting other refugee-like populations. Temporary protected status (TPS) applies to non-citizens from states experiencing  armed conflict, the aftermath of natural disaster, or other extraordinary, temporary conditions that make it unsafe to return. The TPS statute allows the Secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to designate states or regions within states for TPS, although the United States has never limited TPS to sub-state groups. TPS does not cover persons from designated states who arrive following the effective date of the designation, even those who fled great peril. TPS recipients cannot petition for the admission of close family members. In addition, TPS cannot be granted to persons in substantial need of protection from undesignated states.   Like refugees and asylees, TPS recipients receive work authorization. Unlike refugees or asylees, they are not eligible for <b>resettlement</b> <b>benefits</b> or deemed “qualified” for most federal public benefit programs. They can apply for political asylum and immigration benefits. However, TPS does not, in itself, lead to permanent status or other durable solutions.   Beyond TPS, the executive branch can exercise its discretion not to remove persons who fall outside its law enforcement priorities, including persons who might otherwise suffer violence, extraordinary hardship, or death at home.   This paper outlines international standards for the design and operation of temporary protection programs, describes the US refugee protection program writ large, and identifies gaps in protection. It recommends that Congress create a non-immigrant “protection” visa for non-citizens who are at substantial risk of persecution, danger, or harm in their home or host countries, and that DHS expand its use of parole for de facto refugees and individuals in refugee-like situations. It also argues that the United States should prioritize the reconstruction and development of TPS-designated states and work to establish regional migration and development agreements covering North America, Central America and the Caribbean. Congress should also pass legislation to extend LPR status to long-term recipients of temporary protection.  In particular, it should advance the “registry” date to January 1, 1999 (which would provide LPR status to most non-citizens in the country since that date) and it should automatically move up the registry cut-off date each year thereafter by one year. It should also pass broad immigration reform legislation, including a legalization program that would credit years in receipt of temporary protection toward the time required to “earn” legalization. And it should allow temporary protection recipients to apply affirmatively for “cancellation of removal” (which brings LPR status) after 10 years. DHS should also create a more inclusive TPS determination process by hosting quarterly public hearings on conditions in TPS-designated and TPS–eligible nations. It should also re-designate more states for TPS in order to allow persons from designated states who have fled dangerous conditions and entered the United States between the initial designation and re-designation periods to qualify for TPS.       [1] Temporary protection refers to the universe of programs that provide safe haven to persons who would be at risk in their home or host countries. Temporary protected status (TPS) is the US program that offers group protection to non-citizens from designated states. [2] In a legal fiction, parole does not constitute an “admission. ” Nor does it connote criminal conduct under US immigration law. It is an exercise of executive discretion that allows physical entry and residence for a temporary period. </div...|$|E
