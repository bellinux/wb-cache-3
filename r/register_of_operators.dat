50|$|In {{line with}} an IATA resolution, from December 2006 the airline began to publish its fares for {{international}} destinations originating in Russia in euros, rather than US dollars. This {{resulted in a}} fare increase, as the conversion rate used was 1 euro = 1 US dollar. Fuel surcharges were also published in euros. Its domestic fares were still to be shown in the local currency. Also in December 2006, the airline became the second Russian air carrier to complete, and pass, the IATA International Safety Audit (IOSA), {{which is the first}} global air safety standard. On 27 September 2007, OAO Sibir Airlines /S7 Airlines/ received an official notice of IATA when the carrier was entered in the <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>operators</b> IOSA.|$|E

ZIMRA is well known of meeting its set target by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. Value Added Tax (VAT) {{is one of the}} tax heads that ZIMRA uses as a method of collecting revenue in Zimbabwe. VAT a tax system which is levied, charged and collected on behalf of the Zimbabwean government on the value of supplies made by <b>registered</b> <b>operators</b> <b>of</b> goods and services and importations of any goods and services into Zimbabwe. ZIMRA then introduced the use of Electronic Fiscal Devices to enhance efficiency in the collection of VAT. The Electronic Fiscal Devices were introduced in 2011.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the effectiveness of VAT administration on revenue collection. The researcher observed during audit that revenue collected from VAT is continuously decreasing when the economy started to be unstable. VAT administration that was used when the economy was stable is still being used to the unstable economy and this has caused a lot of challenges in VAT administration. This has highly negatively affected revenue collection on VAT. Descriptive research design was used to gather data using questionnaires and interviews as research instruments. A sample of 45 people was used comprises <b>of</b> <b>registered</b> <b>operators,</b> VAT officers, line managers and the managing director of Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA). The research finding indicated that the effectiveness of VAT administration on revenue collection is affected by the instability of the economy of Zimbabwe. The effectiveness of VAT administration is affected through its factors that are the registration of VAT taxpayers, processing of VAT returns, and collection of VAT arrears, penalties and interest, VAT refunds, VAT rates, VAT audits. The respondents also noted that the effectiveness of VAT administration of revenue collection is negatively affected due to the current economic hardships. The recommendations that were made were that ZIMRA should revise its VAT administration that were used during the stable economy to suits the unstable economy through decrease of VAT threshold, VAT rate, payment plan, frequent <b>of</b> VAT audits, <b>registering</b> <b>of</b> informal sectors...|$|R
5000|$|Registration {{of motor}} {{vehicles}} in Australia is done through each state and territory government, through their road transport agencies. [...] Registration certificates record the <b>registered</b> <b>operator</b> <b>of</b> a vehicle, they often act {{as proof of}} ownership, though technically, {{this is not the}} case. Ownership is governed by common law. Ownership of the vehicle (if a secured financial asset) may be checked through the Personal Property Security <b>Register</b> <b>of</b> the federal government, though this is not a mandatory register. [...] Often some proof of entitlement or ownership is required to register a car. [...] A [...] "Certificate of Vehicle Registration" [...] or similar is issued by the state or territory agency, this document {{can be used as a}} secondary identity document <b>of</b> the <b>operator.</b> Along with the certificate, the agency also issues vehicle registration number plates. The registration lasts generally for a maximum of a year, after which time the vehicle registration must be renewed. The registration certificate notes the model, make, year, shape, VIN Chasis number and Engine number, weights, engine capacity and number of passengers. A compulsory third party insurance policy is required to renew the vehicle, as well as inspections for older or commercial vehicles. [...] While most states and territories no longer issue registration stickers for the vehicle, registration details are available electronically by police or online by individuals in most states. Vehicles can be registered to companies or individuals. Certain vehicles are registered with the federal government, e.g. military or through the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme (FIRS) via state or territory agencies. Increasingly, many registration functions can be performed online.|$|R

40|$|Surveys have {{identified}} that many older motorcyclists are returning riders {{but it is}} difficult to draw conclusions about their crash risk because of discrepancies in definitions and the inability to identify returning riders in official crash databases. Analyses of NSW crash data were undertaken in which returning riders were defined as aged 25 and over, holding a full licence 10 years prior to the crash, and not the <b>registered</b> <b>operator</b> <b>of</b> one or more motorcycles during the 5 - 10 years prior to the crash. Based on this definition, there were 472 riders in casualty crashes in 2005 - 09 who were returning riders (5. 5 % of riders aged 25 and over in casualty crashes) and the characteristics of their crashes were similar to those involving continuing riders. In contrast, crashes of new riders were more likely to have characteristics suggestive of relatively more riding in urban areas, probably for transport rather than recreation. More work is recommended to assess the validity of the definition to allow a better understanding of the effects of long periods away from riding on riding skills and crash risk...|$|R
