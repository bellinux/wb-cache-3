As people age, they often reach a point when {{they are no longer}} capable of handling their own finances or have difficulty making other decisions for themselves. To ensure that federal cash payments received by incapacitated adults are used in their best interest, the Social Security Administration (SSA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and other federal agencies assign a <b>responsible</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> or fiduciary to oversee these benefits. SSA and VA can designate spouses, other family members, friends, and organizations to serve as fiduciaries. Similarly, when state courts determine that adults are incapacitated, they have the authority to grant other persons or entities [...] guardians [...] the authority and responsibility to make financial and other decisions for them. Incapacitated adults are vulnerable to financial exploitation by fiduciaries and guardians, so these arrangements are not without risk. In 2010, we identified hundreds of allegations of abuse, neglect, and exploitation by guardians in 45 states and the District of Columbia between 1990 and 2010. At that time, we reviewed 20 of these cases and found that guardians had stolen or otherwise improperly obtained $ 5. 4 million from 158 incapacitated victims, many of whom were older adults. To protect against financial exploitation, state courts as well as federal agencies are responsible for screening prospective guardians and federal fiduciaries, respectively, to make sure suitable individuals are appointed. They are also responsible for monitoring the performance of those they appoint. This statement today is based on our recent report on this topic. It will cover (1) SSA and VA procedures for screening prospective federal fiduciaries, and state court procedures for screening prospective guardians; (2) SSA and VA monitoring of federal fiduciary performance, and state court monitoring of guardian performance; (3) information sharing between SSA and VA fiduciary programs and between each of these programs and state courts; and (4) federal support for improving state courts' oversight of guardianships. ...|$|E

40|$|Reports on {{a survey}} into the {{copyright}} and intellectual property (IPR) policies of UK higher education institutions with regards to lecture recording. The practice of using institutional semi-automated lecture recording systems is becoming mainstream with 71 % of institutions reporting using it in 2016 (UCISA, 2016). However, these systems raise {{a number of issues}} related to copyright and IPR that in some cases are documented in specific policy documents. Issues that arise include the consent that is obtained from academic staff, the ownership of the resulting outputs and responsibility and advice given for the use of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> content in the lectures. These issues are also often linked to, or conflated with wider ethical issues such as identity, privacy and academic freedom. The findings from the survey are presented alongside a policy analysis of IPR documents and policies from 11 institutions. These are compared to the guidance provided by Jisc (2015). The findings from the survey reveal that most institutions are still developing their IPR policy with regards to lecture recording, that many institutions seek consent from lecturers, but there is an increasing move towards making lecture recording opt-out as opposed to opt-in. The survey revealed in 94 % of cases the lecturers or presenter is <b>responsible</b> for any <b>third</b> <b>party</b> content contained within their lecture and while institutions do offer advice about dealing with <b>third</b> <b>party</b> content, much of it is delivered in a relatively passive way, through agreeing to use the system or by information made available online in guides. The findings from the policy analysis suggest that those institutions {{with a high level of}} institutional control tend to have a higher level of comprehensiveness of approach towards lecture recording. Additionally the institutions that provide a higher level of support for copyright advice, have a tendency towards open practice and higher levels of appetite for risk.

40|$|<b>Third</b> <b>parties</b> play a {{prominent}} role in network-based explanations for successful knowledge transfer. <b>Third</b> <b>parties</b> can be either shared or unshared. Shared <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> signal insider status and have a predictable positive effect on knowledge transfer. Unshared <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> however, signal outsider status and are believed to undermine knowledge transfer. Surprisingly, unshared <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> have been ignored in empirical analysis, and so we do not know if or how much unshared <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> contribute to the process. Using knowledge transfer data from an online technical forum, we illustrate how unshared <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> affect the rate at which individuals initiate and sustain knowledge transfer relationships. Empirical results indicate that unshared <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> undermine knowledge sharing, and they also indicate that the magnitude of the negative unshared-third-party effect declines the more unshared <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> overlap in what they know. Our results provide a more complete view of how <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> contribute to knowledge sharing. The results also advance our understanding of network-based dynamics defined more broadly.

40|$|This article {{systematically}} {{examines the}} varying effectiveness of African and non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> in mediating civil wars in Africa. Drawing {{on data from}} the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, supplemented with unique data on mediation efforts, which together cover all mediation efforts in civil wars in Africa between 1960 and 2012, this article presents quantitative evidence supporting the effectiveness of African <b>third</b> <b>parties.</b> Compared to non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> {{are far more likely}} to conclude peace agreements and these peace agreements are more likely to be durable. Most effective, however, are mixed mediation efforts in which there is coordination between African and non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> but in which African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> take the lead. The phrase, ‘African solutions to African challenges’ should thus be understood as a division of labour and responsibilities, rather than an excuse for non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> to ignore Africa’s problems or African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> acting on their own. Indeed, whilst African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> should take the lead in mediation processes in African civil wars, non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> should support these processes by lending additional strength.

40|$|How is two-party electoral {{competition}} {{influenced by}} <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> even under normal political conditions? I {{argue that the}} mere threat of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> entry into the election induces anticipatory electoral strategies by the major parties. This effect, which is a normal aspect of the two-party system, is how <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> play a consistent role in U. S. elections. The ability for <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> to influence the major parties is moderated by electoral institutions. The ballot access requirement, {{in the form of}} a signature requirement, varies widely across House elections and is a significant predictor of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> electoral success. Consistent with conventional wisdom, I find that it has a negative effect on the likelihood of entry. Notably, the requirement also has a positive effect on <b>third</b> <b>party</b> vote shares, conditional on successful petitioning, due to a screening and quality effect. I explore the effects of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat in unidimensional and multidimensional settings. A formal model of elections predicts that the threat of entry induces major party divergence in a unidimensional ideological space. The major parties diverge in anticipation of potential <b>third</b> <b>party</b> entry. An empirical analysis of candidate positioning in the 1996 U. S. House elections finds support of this hypothesis. Data on major party campaign advertising in the 2000 to 2004 U. S. House elections are used to assess <b>third</b> <b>party</b> effects in a multidimensional framework. I show that <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat influences the scope and content of campaign advertising. Major party candidates, particularly incumbents, discuss a broader range of issues when <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat is higher. I use the case of environmental issues and the Green party to assess the influence of <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> on issue-specific content. I find that Green party threat leads to predictable differences between Democratic and Republican advertising on environmental issues. In sum, <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> play a consistent role in U. S. House elections by inducing anticipatory strategies by the major parties. This strategic framework for understanding <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> stresses two things. First, one should focus on the major parties in order to gauge the influence of <b>third</b> <b>parties.</b> Second, one should not conclude that <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> are irrelevant because of their minimal electoral success. <b>Third</b> <b>party</b> effects are in fact present even in elections where a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> does not enter.

The <b>third</b> <b>party</b> may sue the agent, as principal, on the contract; equally the agent may, as principal, sue the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> on the contract. When, however, the undisclosed principal discovers that the contract that he in fact authorised has been concluded, he may adopt it, and may consequently sue the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> on it. Equally, the <b>third</b> <b>party,</b> on discovering the undisclosed principal, may sue the principal on the contract. it follows that the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> has a choice or an election to sue either the agent or the undisclosed principal, when discovered; but having elected to sue one of them the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> is debarred from suing the other, even if he or she sues the agent before being aware that there is a principal.
