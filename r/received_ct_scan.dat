40|$|Background: Stroke is {{becoming}} an increasingly serious public health issue in Ethiopia and the paucity of data specific to the Ethiopian setting is limiting the formulation of an appropriate response. Objective: This study aimed to describe types, risk factors, management patterns, and outcomes among stroke patients treated at a tertiary teaching hospital in northern Ethiopia from 2012 to 2014. Design: Medical record review with a standardized abstraction tool was used to obtain all data for this retrospective case study. Data was entered in EpiInfo Version 7 and analyzed using STATA 12. Descriptive statistics were used to explore differences among stroke subtypes and compare with other sub-Saharan African countries. Results: Among 142 stroke patients (mean age 62. 8  ±  15. 6  years, 54. 2 % male), ischemic stroke was the most frequent subtype (55. 6 %) followed by intracerebral hemorrhage (32. 4 %) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (5. 6 %). 38. 0 % of patients had pre-existing hypertension and 4. 9 % had pre-existing diabetes, and most were not on any treatment. 66. 2 % of patients were hypertensive at hospital arrival and nearly all presented with focal neurological deficit. Less than 10 % arrived at the hospital within 3  h of stroke; nearly half (47. 9 %) were delayed over 24  h. 76. 1 % <b>received</b> <b>CT</b> <b>Scan.</b> We observed 12. 0 % in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: Ischemic stroke was the predominant form of stroke, although {{to a lesser degree}} than in studies from developed countries. Under-diagnosing of hypertension and other risk factors and delayed presentation at the hospital are the major challenges to address...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Pelvic x-ray is {{a routine}} {{part of the}} primary survey of polytraumatized {{patients}} according to Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines. However, pelvic CT is the gold standard imaging technique in the diagnosis of pelvic fractures. This {{study was conducted to}} confirm the safety of a modified ATLS algorithm omitting pelvic x-ray in hemodynamically stable polytraumatized patients with clinically stable pelvis in favour of later pelvic examination by CT scan. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of all polytraumatized patients in our emergency room between 01. 07. 2004 and 31. 01. 2006. Inclusion criteria were blunt abdominal trauma, initial hemodynamic stability and a stable pelvis on clinical examination. We excluded patients requiring immediate intervention because of hemodynamic instability. Results We reviewed the records of n = 452 polytraumatized patients, of which n = 91 fulfilled inclusion criteria (56 % male, mean age = 45 years). The mechanism of trauma included 43 % road traffic accidents, 47 % falls. In 68 / 91 (75 %) patients, both a pelvic x-ray and a CT examination were performed; the remainder had only pelvic CT. In 6 / 68 (9 %) patients, pelvic fracture was diagnosed by pelvic x-ray. None of these 6 patients was found having a false positive pelvic x-ray, i. e. there was no fracture on pelvic CT scan. In 3 / 68 (4 %) cases a fracture was missed in the pelvic x-ray, but confirmed on CT (false negative on x-ray). None of the diagnosed fractures needed an immediate therapeutic intervention. 5 (56 %) were classified type A fractures, and another 4 (44 %) B 2. 1 in computed tomography (AO classification). One A 2. 1 fracture was found in a clinically stable patient who only <b>received</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> (1 / 23). Conclusion While pelvic x-ray {{is an integral part of}} ATLS assessment, this retrospective study suggests that in hemodynamically stable patients with clinically stable pevis, its sensitivity is only 67 % and it may safely be omitted in favor of a pelvic CT examination if such is planned in adjunct assessment and available. The results support the safety and utility of our modified ATLS algorithm. A randomized controlled trial using the algorithm can safely be conducted to confirm the results. </p...|$|E

In this study, we performed brachytherapy with computed tomography (CT) -guided permanent implantation of 125 I seeds {{in the treatment of}} patients with the recurrence of NPC. Methods: A total 30 patients (20 male and ten female) at the median age of 55 (range 25 – 80) years were diagnosed with recurrent nonkeratin NPC, with a total 38 lesions and a short disease-free interval (median ~ 11 months) after primary radiotherapy alone or combined with chemotherapy. Patients <b>received</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan,</b> starting from 2 months after the treatment. Follow-up was conducted for ~ 2 – 38 months to observe the local control rate and overall survival rate. We also analyzed the possible correlation between survival periods and the status of recurrent tumors. Results: The local control rates at 6, 12, 24, 30, and 36 months after the procedure of 125 I seed implantation were 86. 8 %, 73. 7 %, 26. 3 %, 15. 8 %, and 5. 3 %, respectively. The overall 1 -, 2 -, and 3 -year survival rates were 80. 0 % (24 / 30), 30. 0 % (9 / 30), and 6. 7 % (2 / 30), respectively, with a median survival period of 18 months (17. 6 ± 8. 6 months). Interestingly, the survival periods of the patients who had primary radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy were 15. 8 ± 7. 9 and 24. 3 ± 7. 9 months, respectively. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis demonstrated that χ 2 (log rank) was 7. 555, with very significant difference (P< 0. 01). The survival periods of patients in tumor stages I, II, III, and IV were 25. 4 ± 8. 7, 19. 8 ± 9. 4, 16. 1 ± 4. 5, and 12. 8 ± 7. 8 months, respectively, with significant differences (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Our data suggest that the survival period of recurrent NPC patients after 125 I seed implantation is inversely related to the tumor stages of the recurrence but not to chemotherapy after the primary radiotherapy. Therefore, CT-guided 125 I seed implantation can be set for treatment of recurrent NPC, for better survival rate with minimal damage. Keywords: CT-guided 125 I seed, radiochemotherapy, NPC ...|$|E
30|$|In our study, early CT brain imaging had a {{very low}} {{diagnostic}} yield, with only one early scan (2.1 %) revealing a relevant finding. the incidence of late scanning was low and all patients who died <b>received</b> early <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> This suggests that no acute pathology was missed.

40|$|Objectives: Of the {{currently}} published clinical decision {{rules for the}} management of minor head injury (MHI) in children, the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rule, derived and validated in a large multicenter prospective study cohort, with high methodologic standards, appears to be the best clinical decision rule to accurately identify children at very low risk of clinically important traumatic brain injuries (ciTBI) in the pediatric emergency department (PED). This study describes the implementation of an adapted version of the PECARN rule in a tertiary care academic PED in Italy and evaluates implementation success, in terms of medical staff adherence and satisfaction, as well as its effects on clinical practice. Methods:  The adapted PECARN decision rule algorithms for children (one for those younger than 2  years and one for those older than 2  years) were actively implemented in the PED of Padova, Italy, for a 6 -month testing period. Adherence and satisfaction of medical staff to the new rule were calculated. Data from 356 visits for MHI during PECARN rule implementation and those of 288 patients attending the PED for MHI in the previous 6  months were compared for changes in computed tomography (CT) scan rate, ciTBI rate (defined as death, neurosurgery, intubation for longer than 24  hours, or hospital admission at least for two nights associated with TBI) and return visits for symptoms or signs potentially related to MHI. The safety and efficacy of the adapted PECARN rule in clinical practice were also calculated. Results:  Adherence to the adapted PECARN rule was 93. 5 %. The percentage of medical staff satisfied with the new rule, in terms of usefulness and ease of use for rapid decision-making, was significantly higher (96 % vs. 51 %, p <  0. 0001) compared to the previous, more complex, internal guideline. CT scan was performed in 30 patients (8. 4 %, 95 % confidence interval [CI] =  6 % to 11. 8 %) in the implementation period versus 21 patients (7. 3 %, 95 % CI =  4. 8 % to 10. 9 %) before implementation. A ciTBI occurred in three children (0. 8 %, 95 % CI =  0. 3 to 2. 5) during the implementation period and in two children (0. 7 %, 95 % CI =  0. 2 to 2. 5) in the prior 6  months. There were five return visits (1. 4 %) postimplementation and seven (2. 4 %) before implementation (p =  0. 506). The safety of use of the adapted PECARN rule in clinical practice was 100 % (95 % CI =  36. 8 to 100; three of three patients with ciTBI who <b>received</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> at first evaluation), while efficacy was 92. 3 % (95 % CI =  89 to 95; 326 of 353 patients without ciTBI who did not receive a CT scan). Conclusions:  The adapted PECARN rule was successfully implemented in an Italian tertiary care academic PED, achieving high adherence and satisfaction of medical staff. Its use determined a low CT scan rate that was unchanged compared to previous clinical practice and showed an optimal safety and high efficacy profile.

40|$|Background: Head {{injuries}} {{are common in}} children and account for over 600 000 emergency room visits annually. Many children <b>receive</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> {{as part of their}} work-up to evaluate for intracranial injury. <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> add risk of sedation and ionizing radiation, and recent effort has been made {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> ordered in the evaluation of a head-injured child. Skull fractures are an independent risk factor for intracranial injury, and ultrasound may be of use to the clinician trying to detect these fractures. In the pediatric patient with a minor head injury, is ultrasound effective for the detection of skull fractures when compared to the reference standard CT? Methods: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was conducted on Medline-Ovid, Web of Science, and CINAHL-Ebscohost using the keywords “ultrasonography OR sonography” AND “skull fractures. ” Reference lists from articles were examined, and any relevant sources were examined independently. The studies were evaluated and assessed using the GRADE method. Results: Three prospective studies were evaluated. Ultrasound was examined as a diagnostic modality for skull fracture detection and was compared against the reference standard of CT. Ultrasound was found to have high specificity (94 %, 95 %, and 97 %) and moderate sensitivity (82 %, 100 %, and 88 %) respectively, in detecting skull fractures in pediatric patients. Conclusion: Ultrasound detects skull fractures in children with high specificity, but this may not be relevant in clinical use. Clinical decision rules and algorithms, such as the PECARN score, are already well studied and used to guide clinicians in their evaluation of head-injured children. Future studies that evaluate ultrasound in conjunction with a clinical decision rule are needed to determine if the incorporation of ultrasound as a diagnostic modality will help decrease the use of <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> in the pediatric population...|$|R

Performances of original dictated reports, an untrained reviewer, and a trained reviewer (who was trained on 22 non-traumatic scans) were compared. Of the 66 pregnant women who <b>received</b> abdominal <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> 44 sustained abdominal trauma. Seven suffered placental abruptions, all of which were identified on CT. Sensitivity and specificity were 100 % and 79. 5 %, respectively, for the untrained reviewer, 100 % and 82. 1 % for the trained reviewer, and 42. 9 % and 89. 7 % for the original dictated reports. Placental abruptions are often overlooked on <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> Sensitivity may be improved by systematic evaluation of the placenta and specificity by training on normal placental morphology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Prediction {{rules for}} {{intracranial}} traumatic findings {{in patients with}} minor head injury are designed to reduce the use of computed tomography (CT) without missing patients at risk for complications. This study investigates whether alternative modelling techniques might improve the applicability and simplicity of such prediction rules. Methods We included 3181 patients with minor head injury who had <b>received</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> between February 2002 and August 2004. Of these patients 243 (7. 6 %) had intracranial traumatic findings and 17 (0. 5 %) underwent neurosurgical intervention. We analyzed sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve (AUC-value) to compare the performance of various modelling techniques by 10 × 10 cross-validation. The techniques included logistic regression, Bayes network, Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID), neural net, support vector machines, Classification And Regression Trees (CART) and "decision list" models. Results The cross-validated performance was best for the logistic regression model (AUC 0. 78), followed by the Bayes network model and the neural net model (both AUC 0. 74). The other models performed poorly (AUC Conclusions No alternative modelling technique outperformed the logistic regression model. However, the Bayes network model had a presentation format which provided more detailed insights into {{the structure of the}} prediction problem. The search for methods with good predictive performance and an attractive presentation format should continue. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{quantify}} the radiation dose in the thyroid attributable to different <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> and {{to estimate the}} thyroid cancer risk in pediatric patients. Methods: The information about pediatric patients who underwent <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> was abstracted from the radiology information system in one general hospital between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012. The radiation doses were calculated using the ImPACT Patient Dosimetry Calculator and the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of thyroid cancer incidence was estimated based on the National Academies Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII model. Results: The subjects comprised 922 children, 68 % were males, and <b>received</b> 971 <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> The range of typical radiation dose to the thyroid {{was estimated to be}} 0. 61 – 0. 92 mGy for paranasal sinus <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> 1. 10 – 2. 45 mGy for head <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> and 2. 63 – 5. 76 mGy for chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> The LAR of thyroid cancer were as follows: for head CT, 1. 1 per 100, 000 for boys and 8. 7 per 100, 000 for girls; for paranasal sinus <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> 0. 4 per 100, 000 for boys and 2. 7 per 100, 000 for girls; for chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> 2. 2 per 100, 000 for boys and 14. 2 per 100, 000 for girls. The risk of thyroid cancer was substantially higher for girls than for the boys, and from chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> was higher than that from head or paransal sinus <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> Conclusions: Chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> caused higher thyroid dose and the LAR of thyroid cancer incidence, compared with paransal sinus or head <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> Therefore, physicians should pay more attention to protect the thyroid when children underwent <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> especially chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} {{the frequency of}} evolution in CT appearance from an initial scan to a subsequent scan within 12  h and the prognostic significance of such deterioration. Methods: All patients who presented to Department of Neurosurgery, Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College with traumatic brain injury and <b>received</b> their <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> within the first 4  h of injury {{were included in the}} study. Indications for repeat <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> were: any deterioration in neurological status after the initial scan, potentially deteriorating lesion on initial scan with or without worsening neurology, worsening neurological status after the initial <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> findings, or no neurological improvement after initial management in patients with normal <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> with significant head injury. This compiled with the data of 107 patients. Results: There were 67 males and 40 females. The cause of trauma of the 70 % patients was road traffic accident. In 11 patients, the lesion evolved towards resorption while 32 patients had no significant changes in the subsequent <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> Sixty four patients showed an increase {{in the size of the}} lesion and 65. 6 % of them were required surgical intervention subsequently. Conclusions: In case where the initial <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> performed within 4  h of significant head injury was not correlated with the patient's neurology, it should be repeated within 12  h...|$|R
5000|$|In medicine, an incidentaloma is a tumor (...) {{found by}} {{coincidence}} (incidentally) without clinical symptoms or suspicion. Like {{other types of}} incidental findings, it is found {{during the course of}} examination and imaging for other reasons. It is a common occurrence: up to 7% of all patients over 60 may harbor a benign growth, often of the adrenal gland, which is detected when diagnostic imaging is used for the analysis of unrelated symptoms. With the increase of [...] "whole-body CT scanning" [...] as part of health screening programs, the chance of finding incidentalomas is expected to increase. 37% of patients <b>receiving</b> whole-body <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> have abnormal findings that may need further evaluation. Since many incidentally found lesions may never cause disease, there is a risk of overdiagnosis.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. In {{patients}} with blunt trauma, a cross-table lateral cervical (CTLC) film {{is followed by}} a focused computed tomographic (<b>CT)</b> <b>scan</b> of the cervical spine to assess an area inadequately delineated by common techniques and suspected injuries, based on recent guidelines in the United States. The {{purpose of this study was}} to calculate the frequency of such supplemental <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> and to evaluate the efficacy of the recent guidelines describing the use of CTLC films as an indicator of supplemental focused <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> in Japan. METHODS. A review of CTLC films was performed. 100 initial CTLC films with injuries and another 100 films without injuries were evaluated for the lowest vertebra visualised on the CTLC film. The frequency of abnormal signs on the CTLC films was then examined. RESULTS. Technically adequate CTLC films that showed the upper border of the T 1 vertebra were not obtained from 70 {{patients with}} injuries and 63 patients without injuries. 88 patients with injuries and 28 patients without injuries had abnormal findings on CTLC films. Overall, 97 patients with injuries and 74 patients without injuries should have <b>received</b> supplemental <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> CONCLUSION. CTLC films require frequent supplemental use of CT, even for patients without cervical spine injuries. Thus, the guidelines that consider CTLC film as an indicator of the necessity for <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> are not efficient and need revision...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is an {{autosomal recessive}} genetic disease that affects approximately 30, 000 people in the United States. Mucus in CF patients can be exceptionally viscous, leading to progressive cycles of inflammation and infection. The most widely accepted staging system used to score sinus computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> <b>scans</b> is the Lund- Mackay Score (LMS). Methods: To determine if a significant correlation exists between LMS {{and the need for}} revision sinus surgery in a patient population with CF, we performed a retrospective review of 32 patients with CF who were referred to the Tulane Otolaryngology Clinic from 2005 to 2011 and <b>received</b> a <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> of the paranasal sinuses. <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> were graded in a blinded manner by the institution 2 ̆ 7 s neuroradiologist using the LMS system. Results: We found no statistically significant difference in the raw or scaled LMSs between patients receiving revision surgery (n 1 / 49) and patients receiving a single surgery (n 1 / 423). Conclusions: <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> are vital for preoperative planning, but they are not a useful tool for risk stratification. More specifically, application of the LMS is not relevant in identifying which CF patients with chronic rhinosinusitis will be at risk for revision surgeries...|$|R

A major trauma (whole-body) CT protocol based upon mechanism of injury was investigated in a busy emergency department. Methods Trauma patients presenting in two 3 -month periods before and after the introduction of a major trauma CT protocol were identified. The mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Score, radiological imaging performed and injuries detected were recorded.

40|$|Objectives. Incidental {{findings}} on computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> <b>scans</b> are common. We sought to examine rates of findings and disclosure among discharged patients who <b>received</b> a <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> in the ED. Methods. Retrospective chart review (Aug-Oct 2009) of 600 patients age 18 and older discharged home from an urban Level 1 trauma center. CT reports {{were used to}} identify incidental findings and discharge paperwork {{was used to determine}} whether the patient was informed of these findings. Results. There were 682 <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> among 600 patients: 199 Abdomen & Pelvis, 405 Head, and 78 Thorax. A total of 348 incidental findings were documented in 228 / 682 (33. 4 %) of the scans, of which 34 (9. 8 %) were reported to patients in discharge paperwork. Patients with 1 incidental finding were less likely to receive disclosure than patients with 2 or more (=. 010). Patients age < 60 were less likely to have incidental findings (<. 001). There was no significant disclosure or incidental finding difference by gender. Conclusions. While previous research suggests that CT incidental findings are often benign, reporting to patients is recommended but this is rarely happening...|$|R
50|$|The {{increased}} use of <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> has been the greatest in two fields: screening of adults (screening CT of the lung in smokers, virtual colonoscopy, CT cardiac screening, and whole-body CT in asymptomatic patients) and CT imaging of children. Shortening of the scanning time to around 1 second, eliminating the strict need for the subject to remain still or be sedated, {{is one of the}} main reasons for the large increase in the pediatric population (especially for the diagnosis of appendicitis). As of 2007 in the United States a proportion of <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> are performed unnecessarily. Some estimates place this number at 30%. There are a number of reasons for this including: legal concerns, financial incentives, and desire by the public. For example, some healthy people avidly pay to <b>receive</b> full-body <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> as screening, but it is not at all clear that the benefits outweigh the risks and costs, because deciding whether and how to treat incidentalomas is fraught with complexity, radiation exposure is cumulative and not negligible, and the money for the scans involves opportunity cost (it may have been more effectively spent on more targeted screening or other health care strategies).|$|R
