However, no reported experimental work has dealt with the issue of characterizing the ARW of the constant <b>rate</b> <b>biased</b> RLG in the INS. To avoid the need for high cost precise calibration tables and complex measuring set-ups, the objective {{of this study is to}} present a cost-effective experimental approach to characterize the ARW of the gyros in the constant <b>rate</b> <b>biased</b> RLG INS. In the system, turntable dynamics and other external noises would inevitably contaminate the measured RLG data, leading to the question of isolation of such disturbances. A practical observation model of the gyros in the constant <b>rate</b> <b>biased</b> RLG INS was discussed, and an experimental method based on the fast orthogonal search (FOS) for the practical observation model to separate ARW error from the RLG measured data was proposed. Validity of the FOS-based method was checked by estimating the ARW coefficients of the mechanically dithered RLG under stationary and turntable rotation conditions. By utilizing the FOS-based method, the average ARW coefficient of the constant <b>rate</b> <b>biased</b> RLG in the postulate system is estimated. The experimental results show that the FOS-based method can achieve high denoising ability. This method estimate the ARW coefficients of the constant <b>rate</b> <b>biased</b> RLG in the postulate system accurately.

To get the multitrait-multirater matrix, ten college students watched the video-tapes of football matches and rated {{the performance of}} the players on several traits. After the interviewing of 41 football fans, the performance traits of four different positions in a football team were obtained using critical incident technique. The results indicate: comparing the heterotrait-monorater triangless, some rater&# 39;s rating showed halo effect obviously; comparing the monotrait-heterorater diagonals, ego-centric effect can be shown in some extent on different traits. There were less interrater reliability on the rating of some ambiguous traits. The conclusion can be used on rater training. We can give the raters feedback about their <b>rating</b> <b>bias</b> by analyzing the multitrait-multirater matrix.

40|$|The ongoing rapid {{development}} of the e-commercial and interest-base websites make it more pressing to evaluate objects' accurate quality before recommendation by employing an effective reputation system. The objects' quality are often calculated based on their historical information, such as selected records or rating scores, to help visitors to make decisions before watching, reading or buying. Usually high quality products obtain a higher average ratings than low quality products regardless of <b>rating</b> <b>biases</b> or errors. However many empirical cases demonstrate that consumers may be misled by rating scores added by unreliable users or deliberate tampering. In this case, users' reputation, i. e., the ability to rating trustily and precisely, {{make a big difference}} during the evaluating process. Thus, one of the main challenges in designing reputation systems is eliminating the effects of users' <b>rating</b> <b>bias</b> on the evaluation results. To give an objective evaluation of each user's reputation and uncover an object's intrinsic quality, we propose an iterative balance (IB) method to correct users' <b>rating</b> <b>biases.</b> Experiments on two online video-provided Web sites, namely MovieLens and Netflix datasets, show that the IB method is a highly self-consistent and robust algorithm and it can accurately quantify movies' actual quality and users' stability of rating.

40|$|Abstract: The {{efficient}} markets hypothesis {{implies that}} the forward exchange rate [...] {{the price of the}} currency deliverable 30 days in the future [...] should be an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Empirical studies, however, conclude that the forward rate is biased. We argue that democratic political processes affect the forward <b>rate</b> <b>bias.</b> In particular, elections, cabinet negotiations, and cabinet dissolutions may generate uncertainty about the future composition of the government and its commitment to the exchange rate. Since economic agents will be less able to predict future exchange rate movements during periods of political uncertainty, the forward bias will increase during these periods. We test the effect of political events on the forward bias using data from eight industrial democracies between 1974 and 1995. Using both ordinary least squares and seemingly unrelated regression, we find that political uncertainty helps explain forward <b>rate</b> <b>bias...</b>|$|E

40|$|Rates and {{patterns}} of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions {{have important implications for}} the origin and maintenance of mammalian isochores and the effectiveness of selection at synonymous sites. Previous studies of mammalian nuclear genes largely employed approximate methods to estimate rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions. Because these methods did not account for major features of DNA sequence evolution such as transition/transversion <b>rate</b> <b>bias</b> and unequal codon usage, they might not have produced reliable results. To evaluate the impact of the estimation method, we analyzed a sample of 82 nuclear genes from the mammalian orders Artiodactyla, Primates, and Rodentia using both approximate and maximum-likelihood methods. Maximum-likelihood analysis indicated that synonymous substitution rates were positively correlated with GC content at the third codon positions, but independent of nonsynonymous substitution rates. Approximate methods, however, indicated that synonymous substitution rates were independent of GC content at the third codon positions, but were positively correlated with nonsynonymous rates.

40|$|In this thesis, a novel {{attitude}} estimation {{device is}} proposed utilizing cost-effective measurement sensors. The device fuses a rate gyroscope with an accelerometer array to estimate {{and eliminate the}} <b>rate</b> gyro <b>bias</b> online yielding accurate real time aircraft attitude tracking. Attitude determination algorithms are dependent on instantaneous and accurate measurements of translational and rotational body rates for precise estimation of vehicle orientation in three-dimensional space. Measurement error of instantaneous rate sensors, gyroscopes, is introduced via inherent biases and signal noise resulting in gyro drift. Integration of the rate signal for calculation of a net displacement amplifies these minute measurement errors leading to inaccurate and unreliable attitude observation. The proposed device is a departure from typical attitude observers and bias estimators due to its reliance on accelerometers measuring the local gravitational vector in lieu of additional magnetic field sensors or GPS. The end result of this work is a longitudinal attitude estimation device able to compute a <b>rate</b> gyro <b>bias</b> in real-time producing accurate pitch angle tracking while subjected to simulated aircraft flight conditions.
