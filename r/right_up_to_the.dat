5|$|After {{discarding}} two drafts, Bell approached producer Frank Spotnitz for help. Spotnitz {{suggested that}} the dog could escape from a ship and go on a killing spree. In addition, Spotnitz also {{came up with the}} idea for Mulder and Berquist to develop a quasi-romance before the latter is killed at the end of the episode. Bell began to write the script on January 2, 1999, a mere three weeks before pre-production was scheduled to begin. The episode ended up being re-written <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> start of shooting on February 2.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{had in the}} {{meantime}} expanded his territories west along the Apsus and Genusus river valleys, <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> borders of Illyria. Philip's plan was, it seems, to first take the Illyrian coasts, conquer the area between the coasts and Macedon, and use the new land link to provide a rapid route for reinforcements across the narrow straits to Italy.|$|E
5|$|The Western Front {{continued}} to receive Southern Rhodesian troops <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the}} war, including veterans of the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment's campaign in East Africa. During the conflict's latter stages, the British Army sent some of its Southern Rhodesian officers to the Western Front to promote the colony's benefits, hoping to encourage emigration there by British servicemen after the war.|$|E
50|$|In February 1309 {{a dispute}} was settled between Henry de Lacy of Castle Donington and the Abbey of Chester over the fishing rights here. Unusually the dispute was settled not with either side having <b>rights</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of the}} river, but with the manor of Castle Donington owning their land and <b>the</b> river <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} bank. The boundary of Derbyshire and Leicestershire still take this line.|$|R

50|$|African Americans {{are among}} the largest {{ethnic groups in the}} state of Tennessee, making up 17% of the state's {{population}} in 2010. African Americans arrived in <b>the</b> region prior <b>to</b> statehood. They lived both as slaves and as free citizens with restricted <b>rights</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Civil War. The state, and particularly the major cities of Memphis and Nashville have played important roles in African-American culture and the Civil Rights Movement.|$|R
5|$|The {{issue of}} {{military}} reform, {{which had been}} extremely contentious <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of Leopold II's reign, continued to be important up to {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. Under the influence of pro-militarist lobbying, expansion and further reform of the army was discussed in parliament, and a new system of universal military conscription was adopted in 1913.|$|E
5|$|The tower-keep had {{a modest}} entrance, which was reached by a draw-bridge that lay across the {{surrounding}} moat, which initially reached <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{base of the}} castle. A simple, 12-foot (3.6 m) high bailey wall, with minimal defensive value, surrounded the moat, which was in contrast wide, 10-foot (3 m) deep, {{and would have been}} difficult for an attacker to drain. On {{the east side of the}} castle Nunney Brook was used as a line of defence rather than a bailey wall.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of {{photographic}} societies such as Danske Kamera Piktorialister (Danish Camera Pictorialists) in the 1930s, there was increasing pressure from activists such as H.B.J. Cramer to have photography recognized as an art form. Indeed, the movement continued <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1970s. A counter-movement to pictorialism, the 1920s' Neue Sachlichkeit was slow to reach Denmark but surfaced in 1948 when Keld Helmer-Petersen published his abstract colour studies in 122 Colour Photographs.|$|E

5|$|December 1942 {{also saw}} {{the return of the}} HZL bomber {{squadron}} to Croatia from service on the Eastern Front, where they had flown more than 1,500 sorties. Upon its return the squadron was redesignated 1./(Kroat.)KG after having flown its nine Dornier Do 17Z bombers from Russia back to the NDH. The Dorniers proved a welcome addition to the strike power of the Axis forces fighting the Partisans in Yugoslavian territory <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of 1944. In late 1943, a second squadron, 2./(Kroat.)KG was formed to provide operational training. It was equipped with Italian designed and built CANT Z.1007 and Fiat BR.20 medium bombers.|$|E
5|$|From {{as early}} as the Preclassic period, the ruler of a Maya polity was {{expected}} to be a distinguished war leader, and was depicted with trophy heads hanging from his belt. In the Classic period, such trophy heads no longer appeared on the king's belt, but Classic period kings are frequently depicted standing over humiliated war captives. <b>Right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of the Postclassic period, Maya kings led as war captains. Maya inscriptions from the Classic show that a defeated king could be captured, tortured, and sacrificed. The Spanish recorded that Maya leaders kept track of troop movements in painted books.|$|E
5|$|In {{some parts}} of Iron Age Scotland, quite unlike almost all of {{recorded}} history <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> present day, there {{does not seem to}} have been an hierarchical elite. Studies have shown that these stone roundhouses, with massively thick walls must have contained virtually the entire population of islands such as Barra and North Uist. Iron Age settlement patterns in Scotland are not homogenous, but in these places there is no sign of a privileged class living in large castles or forts, or of an elite priestly caste or of peasants with no access to the kind of accommodation enjoyed by the middle classes.|$|E

5|$|On this occasion, {{an unknown}} number of fire engines were either wheeled or dragged through the streets, some from across the City. The piped water had already failed which they were {{designed}} to use, but parts of the river bank could still be reached. Gangs of men tried desperately to manoeuvre the engines <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river to fill their reservoirs, and several of the engines toppled into the Thames. The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance; they could not even get into Pudding Lane.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{script was}} in use {{up to the}} arrival of the Europeans, its use peaking during the Classic Period. In excess of 10,000 {{individual}} texts have been recovered, mostly inscribed on stone monuments, lintels, stelae and ceramics. The Maya also produced texts painted on a form of paper manufactured from processed tree-bark generally now known by its Nahuatl-language name amatl used to produce codices. The skill and knowledge of Maya writing persisted among segments of the population <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Spanish conquest. The knowledge was subsequently lost, {{as a result of the}} impact of the conquest on Maya society.|$|E
5|$|The assault {{resulted}} in a public outcry over the event which pressured {{all levels of the}} government <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top ranks of the federal government to investigate into the matter. In the closing months of 1992, and also the opening months of 1993, dozens of articles mentioning misdeeds by the royal families of several states–but in particular Sultan Iskandar himself were published. A good deal of these alleged misdeeds that were mentioned included the charging of exorbitant fines–way above the prescribed legal limits–upon offenders who had obstructed the Sultan's car, amongst others. Sultan Iskandar, nevertheless bore the brunt of the backlash by the numerous references centred towards alleged acts of criminal wrongdoings even though many of the listed acts were committed by other members of the royal family.|$|E

The upper hindwing has a pale discal streak.|$|R
5|$|The colour {{alone is}} not a {{reliable}} guide to determine the species, as some scarlet robins (P.boodang) take on an orange hue, but while male scarlet and red-capped robins (P.goodenovii) have red breasts and black throats, the flame robin's breast plumage extends <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> base of the bill. It is also a little slimmer and has a smaller head than the scarlet robin, and is clearly larger than the red-capped. Females of the respective species are harder to tell apart. Those of red-capped, rose and pink robins are all smaller, with wing lengths less than , smaller than the smallest flame robin. The female scarlet robin has a more pronounced red flush to the breast and the spot on the crown above the bill is more prominent and white rather than off-white.|$|E
5|$|The script {{received}} constant {{input from}} the producers and from Shatner and Nimoy. The discussions led to repeated rewrites, <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> day the pages were to be shot. At one point, scenes were being rewritten so often it became necessary to note on script pages the hour of the revision. Though changes were constant, the biggest push for alteration revolved around the ending. Much of the rewriting {{had to do with}} the relationships of Kirk and Spock, Decker and Ilia, and the Enterprise and Vger. A final draft of the third act was approved in late September 1978, but had it not been for a Penthouse interview where NASA director Robert Jastrow said that mechanical forms of life were likely, the ending may not have been approved at all.|$|E
5|$|Stelae were {{considered}} to be invested with holiness and, perhaps, even to contain a divine soul-like essence that almost made them living beings. Some were apparently given individual names in hieroglyphic texts and {{were considered}} to be participants in rituals conducted at their location. Such rituals in the Classic Period appear to have included a k'altun binding ritual, in which the stela was wrapped in bands of tied cloth. This ritual was closely tied to the k'atun-ending calendrical ceremony. A k'altun ritual is depicted carved onto a peccary skull deposited as a funerary offering at Copán, the scene shows two nobles flanking a stela-altar pair where the stela seems to have been bound with cloth. The act of wrapping or binding a sacred object was of considerable religious importance across Mesoamerica, and is well attested among the Maya <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> present day. The precise meaning of the act is not clear, but may be to protect the bound object or to contain its sacred essence. The binding of stelae may be linked to the modern K'iche' Maya practice of wrapping small divinatory stones in a bundle.|$|E

5|$|Tatars {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Kadan experienced a major failure in March 1242 at Klis Fortress, when they were hunting for Béla IV of Hungary. The Tatars believed that the king was in the Klis Fortress, and so they began to attack from all sides, launching arrows and hurling spears. However, the natural defenses of the fortress gave protection, and the Tatars could cause only limited harm. They dismounted from their horses and began to creep up hand over hand to higher ground. But the fortress defenders hurled huge stones at them, and managed to kill a great number. This setback only made the Tatars more ferocious, and they came <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> great walls and fought hand to hand. They looted the houses in the outskirt of the fortress and took away much plunder, but failed to take Klis altogether. Upon learning that the king was not there, they abandoned their attack, and ascending their mounts rode off in the direction of Trogir, a number of them turning off toward Split.|$|E

Furthermore, we will explore the terror threat of today’s Denmark and compare it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> debate of threats post World War II. Our starting point will be different debaters from 1945 til now and compare their argumentation. For argumentation analysis, we apply Toulmins theory of argument, Kai Sørlanders ethical consistency demands and Max Webers mindset- and responsibility ethics...|$|R
