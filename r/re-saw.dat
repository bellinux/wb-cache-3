Pallets were also sold for domestic use in the US.|$|R
5000|$|Cordwood saws, {{also called}} buzz saws in some locales, use blade {{of a similar}} size to sawmills. Where a sawmill rips (cuts with the grain) a {{cordwood}} saw crosscuts (cuts across the grain). Cordwood saws can have a blade from 20 in to more than 36 in diameter depending on the power source and intended purpose. Cordwood saws are used to cut logs and slabs (sawmill waste) into firewood. The Cord (unit) is the standard measurement of standing timber (by estimation) or rough logs. [...] "Cordwood" [...] means unsplit logs four feet long. In the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries, farmers would supply householders in town with cordwood, which would then be <b>re-sawn</b> and split to a length and circumference suitable for woodburning heaters and ranges. Almost all these devices were designed to accept 16-inch sticks, conveniently a piece of cordwood cut into three equal lengths. Once a piece of cordwood had been <b>re-sawn</b> to three 16-inch pieces, it could easily be split to stovewood size with an ax.|$|R
40|$|Case {{hardening}} is {{a feature}} of dried wood that causes the wood to deform (cup) after <b>re-sawing</b> and equalising the moisture content. VTT has analysed case hardening {{with the aid of}} the simulation model PEO and with experimental drying, conditioning and storage tests. Case hardening cannot be predicted by the moisture content gradient alone. However, the case hardening gap after drying to a high final moisture content of 18 % is nearly identical to the calculated gap caused by cupping when the moisture gradients of the two halves of the test piece are equalised. 24 hours (proposed in ENV 14464) is too little time to show the total cupping when keeping the sliced specimens in a plastic bag. Thus the test according the standard doesn’t show the whole cupping tendency of, for example, panels when the moisture content is equalised after <b>re-sawing</b> the timber and planing the billets. Increasing the kiln drying rate increases the resulting case hardening tendency. With effective conditioning at the drying temperature, or with steaming after cooling, it is possible to reduce or remove the case hardening. But at normal temperatures in end-use or storage of timber the case hardening diminishes very slowly, despite the equalising of the moisture content in the cross-sectio...|$|R
50|$|The {{remains of}} the burned-out factory {{building}} were removed {{right down to the}} cement ground floor. Next, workers piped in steam from the heating plant to melt the ice in the water wheel, and power created by the water wheel was transferred to a shaft attached to the cement floor that operated a straight-line rip saw, planer and a few other machines. With manufacturing capability partially restored, workers <b>re-sawed</b> and planed spruce lumber from the company's lumberyard to build a new factory building around the machinery in place. At night, the machines were protected by removable wooden covers that resembled small chicken coops.|$|R
50|$|About {{the same}} time, Yonash became {{involved}} with using a portable sawmill that could be “taken to the tree.” This allowed redwood trees {{that had been left}} as slash from logging to be cut into usable lumber. But the next question was, what to use it for? This led to the birth of Industrial Woodcraft in 1970, located in the old Nulaid property. The founding of Industrial Woodcraft was based on a business principle that Yonash had formulated which said “the smaller the piece the higher the price.” Industrial Woodcraft took “junk” wood and <b>re-sawed</b> it into items such as grape stakes, planter boxes, etc., as well as all manner of custom cut wood for various enterprises—whatever there was a market for.|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} acknowledged {{that in most}} circumstances, some special treatment of an asphalt surface is required to improve aircraft braking in wet conditions. It is increasingly common for transverse grooves to be sawn in the runway surface for this purpose. Grooves introduce a number of potential distress mechanisms that are not present in an ungrooved surface including, rubber filling the grooves, reduction of groove depth due to surface erosion, groove edge break and groove closure. Groove loss by closure is the most concerning form of distress as this usually occurs early in the surface's life and cannot be corrected by <b>re-sawing</b> the grooves. Asphalt resurfacing and regrooving after removal of the closed grooves is required. In addition, maintenance activities such as crack filling, surface rejuvenation sprayed treatments, patching and resurfacing, require additional consideration when grooves are present. Despite the difficulties associated with grooves, sawing of grooves is now the most common method used for improving aircraft braking performance on wet asphalt runways...|$|R

5000|$|The entire Jimna {{operation}} including timber cutters {{was controlled}} by Hancock and Gore Ltd. Once re-erected in 1922, the mill at Jimna was enlarged and in 1924 it was capable of turning out 80,000 super feet of sawn pine weekly. Initially the mill cut only hoop pine using steam-driven saws. In 1933 the Architectural and Building Journal of Queensland reported that Jimna Mill milled approximately 23,000 feet of logs into wide boards and building timbers each day while the top logs were milled into case timber. At Brisbane the building timbers were planed on Hancock and Gore's planning machines and manufactured into all kinds of building timbers including lining boards and flooring. The case timbers were <b>re-sawn</b> and manufactured into butter boxes, jam cases, fruit cases, kerosene cases etc. Specially selected logs were transported to Brisbane for manufacture into [...] "Bull-dog" [...] plywood and Hancock and Gore Ltd high class joinery. Bringing timber to the mill were 15 bullock teams and 11 lorries, while five lorries delivered the sawn and seasoned timber to Kilcoy railway station for transportation to Hancock and Gore establishments in Brisbane. The record for the greatest daily output of pine was 48,000 super feet in 8 hours and for 10 hours work {{on the same day}} the cut was 64,500 super feet.|$|R

40|$|Shape stability, {{the ability}} of the wood to retain its shape, {{is one of the most}} {{important}} parameters when using timber as a building material and for other applications. Generally, timber undergoes changes in dimensions and shape when its moisture content is changed. However, this can often not be tolerated in constructions and thus, methods to improve the shape stability have to be found. In this thesis, the influence of high-temperature drying on the immediate shape stability after drying but also on the long-term behaviour under in-service conditions was studied for Norway spruce and different larch species. Special focus was on twist, as this is the predominant distortion type leading to downgrading of Scandinavian timber species. Small-scale specimens were dried at high temperatures (120 ?C and 170 ?C) and compared to conventional drying (80 ?C). All drying schedules, independent of temperature, included pre-steaming and steaming phases at saturated conditions (98 ?C, 98 % relative humidity). The effect of restrained drying or top-loading was investigated by restraining half of the boards during the drying process. After completed drying, all specimens were moisture-cycled to investigate the permanency of shape stability and distortion reduction attained during restrained drying. The influence of drying temperatures on shape stability of spruce was also compared to commercial heat-treatment. The results showed that high-temperature drying is an alternative for Scandinavian timber species such as Norway spruce and larch. Distortions, especially twist, were successfully reduced by restrained drying and the obtained shape stability was permanent, even in changing humidity conditions. Drying temperature did not influence shape stability, but similar results were found for shape stability for drying at temperatures levels 80, 120 and 170 ?C. The good shape stability for low-temperature drying (80 ?C) is most probably achieved by the pre-steaming and steaming phases, which constituted a short high-temperature treatment with corresponding softening and creep behaviour. Excessively twisted boards were heat-treated at 95 ?C to investigate the possibility to reduce twist. Twist could be effectively reduced by heat-treatment, however, twist increased slightly in subsequent moisture cycling. These results confirm earlier studies in that excessively twisted boards can be straightened by heat-treatment, as mechano-thermal creep helps to attain the desired shape of the board. High-temperature drying influences both the chemical and physical properties of timber. In this study, sorption behaviour, stiffness (static and dynamic modulus of elasticity in bending), bending strength and toughness were investigated. It could be shown that stiffness is more or less unaffected by drying temperature, whereas bending stress decreases with increasing drying temperature. The toughness tests did not show a clear tendency of strength loss with increasing temperature. Finally, the effect of different drying temperatures and heat-treatment on the susceptibility for mould growth was studied. It could be stated that all kiln drying temperatures resulted in about equal mould growth levels, whereas air-drying had lower and heat-treatment substantially lower mould levels. Other factors influencing the amount of mould growth were presence of sapwood or heartwood and the type of surface ? original drying surface or <b>re-sawn</b> surface...|$|R
