25|$|Because the Earth's {{rotation}} speed varies {{in response to}} climatic and geological events, UTC leap seconds are irregularly spaced and unpredictable. Insertion of each UTC leap second is usually decided about six months in advance by the International Earth Rotation and <b>Reference</b> <b>Systems</b> Service (IERS), when needed {{to ensure that the}} difference between the UTC and UT1 readings will never exceed 0.9 seconds.|$|E

25|$|In {{theoretical}} physics, general covariance is the invariance of {{the form}} of physical laws under arbitrary differentiable coordinate transformations. The essential idea is that coordinates are only artifices used in describing nature, and hence should play {{no role in the}} formulation of fundamental physical laws. A more significant requirement is the principle of general relativity that states that the laws of physics take the same form in all <b>reference</b> <b>systems.</b> This is a generalization of the principle of special relativity which states that the laws of physics take the same form in all inertial frames.|$|E
25|$|Because pronominal <b>reference</b> <b>systems</b> to the speaker, addressee, and a {{third person}} are so common (some argue universal) cross-linguistically, {{it would seem that}} pronoun systems are quite stable. However, the changes {{involved}} in second-person pronouns in English call this stability into question and highlight the significance of social forces in language development. The spread of feudalistic ideology caused many European languages to develop two sets of second-person singular pronouns in order to reflect hierarchy. Therefore, pronouns encoded not only person or number, but also the speaker's assessment of the addressee's status and the speaker-addressee relationship.|$|E
25|$|For other {{operation}}s, such as diving {{and heavy}} lifting, {{there is a}} risk of damage or injuries. Depending on the risk, the operation is done in Class 2 or 3. This means at least three Position <b>reference</b> <b>systems</b> should be selected. This allows the principle of voting logic, so the failing PRS can be found. For this reason, there are also three DP control computers, three gyrocompasses, three MRU’s and three wind sensors on Class 3 ships. If a single fault occurs that jeopardizes the redundancy, i.e., failing of a thruster, generator or a PRS, and this cannot be resolved immediately, the operation should be abandoned as quickly as possible.|$|E

40|$|The {{free energy}} of a {{molecular}} system can, at least in principle, be computed by thermodynamic perturbation from a <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> whose free energy is known. The convergence of such a calculation depends critically on the conformational overlap between the reference and the physical systems. One approach to defining a suitable <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> is to construct it from the one-dimensional marginal probability distribution functions (PDFs) of internal coordinates observed in a molecular simulation. However, the conformational overlap of this <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> tends to decline steeply with increasing dimensionality, due {{to the neglect of}} correlations among the coordinates. Here, we test a <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> that can account for pairwise correlations among the internal coordinates, as captured by their two-dimensional marginal PDFs derived from a molecular simulation. Incorporating pairwise correlations in the <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> is found to dramatically improve the convergence of the free energy estimates relative to the first-order <b>reference</b> <b>system,</b> due to increased conformational overlap with the physical distribution...|$|R

2500|$|The {{accident}} {{started at}} 12:40:26 WST {{when one of}} the aircraft’s three air data inertial reference units (ADIRU) started providing incorrect data to the flight computer. In response to the anomalous data, the autopilot disengaged automatically, and a few seconds later, the pilots received electronic messages on the aircraft ECAM, warning them of an irregularity with the autopilot and inertial <b>reference</b> <b>systems,</b> and aural stall and overspeed warnings. During this time, the pilot took control of the aircraft, increasing the altitude to 37,180 ft. The autopilot was then re-engaged and the aircraft started to return to the prior selected flight level. The autopilot was disengaged by the crew after about 15 seconds and would remain disengaged {{for the remainder of the}} flight.|$|E
2500|$|The other {{consequence}} of tidal acceleration is the deceleration of {{the rotation of}} Earth. The rotation of Earth is somewhat erratic on all time scales (from hours to centuries) due to various causes. The small tidal effect cannot be observed in a short period, but the cumulative effect on Earth's rotation as measured with a stable clock (ephemeris time, atomic time) of a shortfall of even a few milliseconds every day becomes readily noticeable in a few centuries. Since some event in the remote past, more days and hours have passed (as measured in full rotations of Earth) (Universal Time) than would be measured by stable clocks calibrated to the present, longer length of the day (ephemeris time). This is known as ΔT. Recent values {{can be obtained from}} the International Earth Rotation and <b>Reference</b> <b>Systems</b> Service (IERS). [...] A table of the actual length of the day in the past few centuries is also available.|$|E

The autopilot became disengaged and the pilots failed to correct for a slow right roll even after a [...] "bank angle" [...] alarm sounded. Despite the bank angle reaching 100° with almost 60° nose down attitude, the pilots did not level the wings before trying to regain pitch control. The aircraft reached [...] {{at the end of}} the recording, in excess of the aircraft's maximum rated speed for a dive (...) [...] The descent rate varied during the fatal dive, with a maximum recorded value of 53,760 feet per minute. The aircraft began to suffer small structural failures twenty seconds prior to the end of the recording, at which time the investigators concluded the aircraft was in a [...] "critically unrecoverable state". Both flight recorders ceased to function when the 737 broke up in mid-air at 9,000 feet above sea level.|$|E
