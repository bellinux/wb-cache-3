5|$|While totally {{dominating}} the region's production, sparkling Champagne {{is not the}} only product that is made from the region's grapes. Non-sparkling still wines, like those made around the village Bouzy, are sold under the appellation label Coteaux Champenois. There is also a rosé appellation in the region, Rosé des Riceys. The regional vin de liqueur is called <b>Ratafia</b> de Champagne. Since the profit of making sparkling Champagne from the region's grape is now much higher, production of these non-sparkling wines and fortified wines is very small.|$|E

50|$|Count Alfred Wojciech Potocki, a {{grandson}} and heir of the Duchess, {{started to run}} the Łańcut and Lwów Lubomirski estates in 1823. He modernised the management of these properties, and implemented the Schwartz distillation equipment. The production of premium vodkas, liqueurs, creams and <b>ratafias</b> was started, in addition to regular and anise flavoured vodkas. The estate ran two company outlets in Lwów and Vienna. In 1882 Alfred Józef Potocki created a network of agents to promote sales in Galicia and Austria-Hungary. Trains of the Viennese rail lines passing through the town of Łańcut used to make longer stops to allow travellers to buy the distilleries' famous products. In 1900, Count Alfred Potocki's Distillery {{won a gold medal}} at the International Exposition in Paris for his array of products. Between 1911-1912 Roman Potocki moved the plant to a newly equipped building. Some of the buildings were destroyed with the eruption of World War I. The difficulties were helped by establishing a stock company in 1917.|$|R
25|$|Although other {{editions of}} the London Pharmacopoeia were issued in 1621, 1632, 1639, and 1677, {{it was not until}} the edition of 1721, {{published}} under the auspices of Sir Hans Sloane, that any important alterations were made. In this issue many of the remedies previously in use were omitted, although a good number were still retained, such as dogs’ excrement, earthworms, and moss from the human skull; the botanical names of herbal remedies were for the first time added to the official ones; the simple distilled waters were ordered of a uniform strength; sweetened spirits, cordials and <b>ratafias</b> were omitted as well as several compounds no longer used in London, although still in vogue elsewhere. A great improvement was effected in the edition published in 1746, in which only those preparations were retained which had received the approval of the majority of the pharmacopoeia committee; to these was added a list of those drugs only which were supposed to be the most efficacious. An attempt was made to simplify further the older formulae by the rejection of superfluous ingredients.|$|R

60|$|Either in {{reward of}} such virtue, or {{according}} to some more hidden law of sequence, Mr. Freely's business, in spite of prejudice, started under favourable auspices. For Mrs. Chaloner, the rector's wife, was among the earliest customers at the shop, thinking it only right to encourage a new parishioner who had made a decorous appearance at church; and she found Mr. Freely a most civil, obliging young man, and intelligent to a surprising degree for a confectioner; well-principled, too, for in giving her useful hints about choosing sugars he had thrown much light on the dishonesty of other tradesmen. Moreover, {{he had been in}} the West Indies, and had seen the very estate which had been her poor grandfather's property; and he said the missionaries were the only cause of the negro's discontent--an observing young man, evidently. Mrs. Chaloner ordered wine-biscuits and olives, and gave Mr. Freely to understand that she should find his shop a great convenience. So did the doctor's wife, and so did Mrs. Gate, at the large carding-mill, who, having high connexions frequently visiting her, might be expected to have a large consumption of <b>ratafias</b> and macaroons.|$|R

The vertigo of omnipotence, the disease of Cæsars, shook her reason. ‘O the mad world!’ she thought, and laughed aloud in exultation.|$|E

The young king, in a flannel jacket, was at tennis with the gentlemen of his suite, crying out after the balls, and swearing like the meanest of his subjects. The next time Mr. Esmond saw him, 'twas when Monsieur Simon took a packet of laces to Miss Oglethorpe: the Prince's ante-chamber in those days, at which ignoble door men were forced to knock for admission to his Majesty. The admission was given, the envoy found the King and the mistress together; the pair were at cards and his Majesty was in liquor. He cared more for three honors than three kingdoms; and a half-dozen glasses of <b>ratafia</b> made him forget all his woes and his losses, his father's crown, and his grandfather's head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hermann l'Ivrogne" [...] {{is another}} piece of the same order; and though not very refined, yet {{possesses}} considerable merit. As {{in the case of}} the celebrated Captain Smith of Halifax, who [...] "took to drinking <b>ratafia,</b> and thought of poor Miss Bailey,"--a woman and the bottle have been the cause of Hermann's ruin. Deserted by his mistress, who has been seduced from him by a base Italian Count, Hermann, a German artist, gives himself entirely up to liquor and revenge: but when he finds that force, and not infidelity, have been the cause of his mistress's ruin, the reader can fancy the indignant ferocity with which he pursues the infame ravisseur. A scene, which is really full of spirit, and excellently well acted, here ensues! Hermann proposes to the Count, on the eve of their duel, that the survivor should bind himself to espouse the unhappy Marie; but the Count declares himself to be already married, and the student, finding a duel impossible (for his object was to restore, at all events, the honor of Marie), now only thinks of his revenge, and murders the Count. Presently, two parties of men enter Hermann's apartment: one is a company of students, who bring him the news that he has obtained the prize of painting; the other the policemen, who carry him to prison, to suffer the penalty of murder.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ratafia</b> is a {{term used}} for two types of sweet {{alcoholic}} beverage, either a fortified wine or a fruit-based beverage. The latter type is a liqueur or cordial flavoured with lemon peel, herbs in various amounts (nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, mint, rosemary, anise, etc.) typically combined with sugar. It may also be prepared with peach or cherry kernels, bitter almonds, or other fruits, as many different varieties are made. The same name is given to a flavouring essence resembling bitter almonds, and also to a light biscuit. The former type {{is a type of}} mistelle, a mixture of marc brandy and the unfermented juice of the grape, and it is the type of <b>Ratafia</b> produced in France.|$|E

5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in Grenoble by Mathieu Teisseire in 1720. The Teisseire {{district}} in the city is named after the family. A distiller by trade, Teisseire originally manufactured vinegars and <b>Ratafia</b> de Teisseire, a type of cherry liqueur which he had invented and which made his family's fortune. [...] The 18th-century Venetian adventurer Giacomo Casanova was particularly fond of Teisseire's <b>ratafia</b> and described it in his memoirs, Histoire de ma vie, as [...] "the divine liqueur of Grenoble". He went on to write: [...] "This excellent liqueur is composed of cherry juice, eau de vie, sugar, and cinnamon, {{and it would be}} impossible for the nectar of the gods on Olympus to surpass it in delicacy."The Teisseire business, which was located at Place Grenette in Grenoble, then passed to Mathieu's son, Mathieu II. With the death of Mathieu II in 1781, it was run his widow and younger son Camille Teisseire whom he had named as his principal heir. For some time after Mathieu II's death, the company was known as Veuve Teisseire & Fils (The Widow Teisseire and Son). In addition to running the family business, Camille Teisseire was an active politician, serving on the Grenoble city council during the French Revolution and later as the Deputy for Isère in the French Parliament. The family further increased its wealth and diversified its holdings when it formed an alliance with the Perier family through Camille's marriage to the daughter of Claude Perier. When Camille Teisseire took up his seat in the French Chamber of Deputies in 1820, he turned the management of the distilling business over to his eldest son Charles, and the company became known as Teisseire, Père & Fils (Teisseire, Father & Son). At that time in addition to their <b>Ratafia</b> de Teisseire, the firm was producing 5 other liqueurs, 19 varieties of eau-de-vie, 8 varieties of wine and spirits, and 24 varieties of crème alcoolisée (a type of liqueur with an elevated sugar content).|$|E
