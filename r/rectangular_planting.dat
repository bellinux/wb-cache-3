When the editors of a symposium on Roman gardens included a contribution on the expected Greek precursors, Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway's article prompted a reviewer to observe, [...] "For all practical purposes there {{appear to have been}} no gardens of any sort in Greek city homes, beyond perhaps a few pots with plants." [...] Aside from vegetable plots and orchards, Ridgway found some literary and a small amount of archaeological evidence for public, or semi-public gardens linked to sanctuaries. In fifth- and fourth-century Athens, some public places were planted with trees, as Plato directed in his Laws, [...] "The fountains of water, whether of rivers or springs, shall be ornamented with plantings and buildings for beauty", though he does not offer details. In 1936 the surroundings of the Temple of Hephaestus at Athens were excavated to bare rock, in which <b>rectangular</b> <b>planting</b> pits were identified, which ran round three sides of the temple but not across its front and were lined up with the columns of the temple. In their bases were the shattered remains of flower pots in which layered stems had been rooted; however, associated coins show that the first of these plantings had been made not before the third century BCE. By that time, in mainland Greece and Ionia, the influence of Achaemenid Persia was paramount in humanly-tended gardens, but in the previous century, of Alexander the Great, Plutarch observed that as a boy he would inquire of Persian visitors to his father's court in Macedon, about Persian roads and military organization, but never of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon; Herodotus, who probably visited Babylon in the mid-fifth century, does not mention the hanging gardens. Xenophon, under Achaemenid Persian influence, planted a grove upon his return to Athens. The myth, set in Macedon, of Silenus discovered drunken by Midas can be dated to the Hellenistic period simply from its setting, a rose garden.|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{analysis}} of progeny trial data improved predicted genetic responses {{by more than}} 10 % for around 20 of the 216 variables tested, although, in general, the gains were more modest. The spatial method partitions the residual variance into an independent component and a two-dimensional spatially autocorrelated component and is fitted using REML. The largest improvements in likelihood were for height. Traits that exhibit little spatial structure (stem counts, form, and branching) did not respond as often. The spatial component represented up to 50 % of the total residual variance, usually subsuming design-based blocking effects. The autocorrelation tended to be high for growth, indicating a smooth environmental surface, it tended to be small for measures of health, indicating patchiness, and otherwise the autocorrelation was intermediate. Negative autocorrelations, indicating competition, were present in only 10 % of diameter measurements for the largest diameter square planted trials, and between nearest trees with <b>rectangular</b> <b>planting</b> at smaller diameters. Bimodal likelihood surfaces indicate that competition may be present, but not dominant, in other cases.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of AERMOD/PRIME for modeling dispersion at two highly complicated sites. One site has a power plant with two 130 m hyperbolic cooling towers and various <b>rectangular</b> <b>plant</b> structures. The other site consists of two combustion turbines with associated multi-tiered, sloped, and porous structures. When simple rectangular structures {{are associated with a}} site, AERMOD should give reasonable concentrations estimates. When the structures become more complicated, porous and/or cylindrical, the model may not give accurate concentration estimates. To evaluate {{the performance of}} AERMOD/PRIME for these situations, wind-tunnel testing was conducted to obtain a data set of maximum ground-level concentrations versus downwind distance for 36 wind directions at each site. AERMOD/PRIME was then run using the BPIP determined building dimensions and the site specific Equivalent Building Dimensions (EBD) for AERMOD/PRIME input. EBD are the building dimensions that should be input in the model to accurately represent the ground-level concentrations due to the wakes and eddies created by the structures on the site. AERMOD/PRIME predicted concentrations, using both BPIP and EBD dimensions, were then compared with windtunnel measurements obtained using a scale model of the facility. ISC/PRIME and ISCST 3 were also run for the same cases for comparative purposes. In general, the results showed that all models agreed best with the wind tunnel observations when EBD were used for the building dimension inputs. The study also showed that AERMOD/PRIME tended to underpredict the wind tunnel concentrations for these sites, apparently because AERMOD/PRIME does not adequately account for stack downwash effects.

40|$|The {{commissioning}} {{and construction}} of new nuclear power plants in the United States has dwindled over the past 30 years despite significant innovation in reactor technology. This is partially due to the ever-increasing seismic hazard estimates, which increases the demand on and risk to nuclear power plant structures. Seismic base isolation is a mature technology which introduces a laterally-flexible and vertically-stiff layer between the foundation and superstructure to significantly reduce the seismic response of the structure, systems, and components therein. Such devices have also been noted to concentrate the displacement response in one plane, reduce higher-mode participation, and provide damping to protect against excessive displacements, all of which aid in increasing safety margins for seismically-isolated nuclear structures. Despite numerous studies analyzing the applicability of seismic base isolation to nuclear power plant structures, {{some of which are}} discussed herein, no seismically-isolated nuclear plant has been constructed in the United States. This study presents a time-domain procedure for analyzing the performance of seismically-isolated nuclear structures in response to design-basis earthquake events using ALE 3 D. The simulations serve as a parametric study to assess the effects of soil column type, seismic isolation model, superstructure mesh, and ground motion selection on global displacements, rotations, and accelerations, as well as internal floor accelerations. Explicit modeling of the soil columns and superstructures enables detailed analysis of soil-structure interaction. The soil columns analyzed have constant properties over the height of the finite element soil mesh and include rock, soft rock, and stiff soil sites, as well as a "no soil" case for comparison. Four separate 3 -dimensional seismic isolation bearing models were coded into ALE 3 D and validated. These include models for friction pendulum, triple friction pendulum, simplified lead rubber, and robust lead rubber bearings. Lastly, two superstructure finite element meshes were considered: a cylindrical plant design meant to represent a typical conceptual design for advanced reactors, and a <b>rectangular</b> <b>plant</b> design meant to represent an advanced boiling water reactor. The ground motions considered include 30 three-component time history records scaled to meet the seismic hazard for the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. Every combination of soil column, isolator model, and superstructure were subjected to a subset of three of the harshest ground motions, termed the "basic motions", and the combinations which included the <b>rectangular</b> <b>plant</b> design atop the rock soil column were subjected to all 30 motions. The results of the various simulations including accelerations in the soil columns and superstructures as well as displacements and rotations in the isolators and superstructures are presented. The results suggest three possible effects: an isolator-type effect, a soil-type effect, and a slenderness effect. The isolator-type effect refers to significant increases in vertical soil acceleration amplifications, isolator uplift/tension, and global rotations including torsion and overturning for friction bearings in comparison to elastomeric bearings. Additionally it is noted that inclusion of lead plug softening has the effect of increasing peak lateral isolator deformations, especially for the ground motions that naturally induce high-amplitude deformations in the bearings. These results suggest that uplift/tension may be troublesome in high-seismic areas and the use of restrainers should be analyzed as a possible solution. Furthermore, these results reinforce the lateral design displacement estimate procedures for seismically-isolated nuclear structures in ASCE 4 - 11. The results prove that explicit inclusion of the soil column is necessary for proper response characterization and the chosen soil properties greatly affect the efficacy of seismic isolation designs. The soil-type effect comes from observations of comparative simulations which show that, in general, peak isolator uplift/tension and deformation, as well as peak global displacements and rotations including torsion and overturning increase as the soil column becomes less-stiff, regardless of the isolator model or superstructure considered. These results suggest that although seismic isolation can be effective for structures atop a variety of soil columns, it is imperative that a single isolator design only be considered applicable to a corresponding soil column unless extensive analyses prove otherwise for a specific case. Differences in peak response parameters between the two superstructures point to a possible slenderness effect. Specifically, the isolator deformations as well as the global displacements and rotations are observed to increase for the cylindrical superstructure in comparison to the rectangular superstructure cases utilizing the same ground motion, soil column, and isolator model. Should further research reaffirm this effect, a practical limit could be set for superstructure slenderness...|$|R

The purpose of the model was to investigate disease dynamics in a plantation over several years, specifically to evaluate {{the relative importance of}} dispersal and infection rates, the effect of inoculum source ageing, the impact of different source sizes and the effect of sanitation. Versions of the model were used to simulate gradients of incidence and severity in the horizontal plane as disease developed with time. Only the case of a within-year monocyclic disease was considered, i. e. infections initiated in one year did not produce inoculum until the next year. One such disease is witches' broom of cocoa (an airborne disease caused by the basidiomycete fungus Crinipellis perniciosa (Stahel) Singer). The probability of inoculum arriving at an infection court from a source was assumed to decline exponentially with distance from that source. Infection was modelled stochastically: an infection occurred if a calculated infection probability exceeded a uniformly-distributed random variable, generated for each possible infection event. The shapes of the gradients in both the incidence and severity models were defined by two parameters. An infection parameter determined the position of the disease front and a inoculum dispersal parameter, the slope of the front. The effects of reduced inoculum production as sources age was incorporated into the incidence model but had only a minor impact on disease spread. The size of the source area initially infected was found to be important only when numbers of diseased trees were few. A threshold, above which further increases in source area had little impact on subsequent dynamics, was reached rapidly. Using the severity model, phytosanitation was found to be effective in retarding disease spread only at very high efficiencies, often in excess of 90 %...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} of using planting pattern for reducing herbicides dose in corn (single cross 704), a field experiment {{was conducted in}} 2007 at research field of Collage of Agriculture, Islamic Azad University branch of Takestan. The experimental design was randomized complete block with 18 treatments and using factorial design with 4 replications. Treatments consisted of corn planting pattern in 3 levels (single row, rectangular twin row and crinkle twin row), and weed control treatments in 6 levels (rates of 1, 1. 5, 2, 2. 5 l/ha foramsulfuron, A weed free as control and full season hand weeding control). Biomass of weed species 15 and 45 days after post emergence herbicide application, and seed yield of corn were measured. Results of statistical analysis showed that different dose of herbicide in each planting pattern had a various effect on weeds. Application of low rates of herbicide in crinkle planting pattern was similar to higher dosages of herbicide in <b>rectangular</b> and single <b>planting</b> pattern. The most seed yield was occurred in the crinkle planting pattern with rate of 2 l. ha- 1 foramsulfuron and the lowest seed yield was belong to single row planting pattern. Environmental and economical advantages {{can be obtained by}} reducing herbicide rates, and selecting an appropriate planting pattern...|$|R
