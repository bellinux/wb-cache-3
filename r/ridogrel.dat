40|$|Background: <b>Ridogrel</b> at low doses {{inhibits}} thromboxane synthase. Oral <b>ridogrel,</b> from 5 mg once {{daily to}} 150 mg twice daily, improves the endoscopic appearance of colonic mucosa and clinical manifestations in {{mild to moderate}} ulcerative colitis. Aim: One US trial and one international trial were conducted {{to determine the effect}} of <b>ridogrel</b> on mild to severe active ulcerative colitis. Methods: Two 12 -week, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trials were conducted. A US trial compared 0. 5 mg, 2. 5 mg and 5 mg of <b>ridogrel</b> once daily with placebo. An international trial compared 0. 5 mg of <b>ridogrel</b> once daily with 2. 5 mg and 5. 0 mg of <b>ridogrel</b> once daily and 800 mg of mesalazine (known as mesalamine in the USA) three times daily. The primary efficacy outcome measure was the rate of complete remission. Results: In the US trial, complete remission was achieved in 20. 8 % of patients in the 0. 5 mg <b>ridogrel</b> group, 17. 9 % in the 2. 5 mg <b>ridogrel</b> group, 20. 6 % in the 5. 0 mg <b>ridogrel</b> group and 13. 6 % in the placebo group. In the international trial, 14. 4 % of patients in the 0. 5 mg <b>ridogrel</b> group, 19. 6 % in the 2. 5 mg <b>ridogrel</b> group. 19. 4 % in the 5. 0 mg <b>ridogrel</b> group and 16. 4 % in the mesalazine group experienced complete remission. In the international trial, rates of complete remission at the end-point were greater in the 2. 5 mg and 5. 0 mg <b>ridogrel</b> groups than in the 0. 5 mg <b>ridogrel</b> group, but the differences were not statistically significant. In the US trial, rates of complete remission at the end-point were greater in the 2. 5 mg and 5. 0 mg <b>ridogrel</b> groups than in the placebo group, but the differences were not statistically significant. Approximately 30 % of the patients in each group discontinued treatment before the 12 -week end-point owing to a lack of therapeutic response. All doses of <b>ridogrel</b> were well tolerated and comparable with placebo or mesalazine in terms of safety. Conclusions: No significant differences in the primary efficacy outcome measure were found between either the 2. 5 mg or the 5. 0 mg dose of <b>ridogrel</b> and placebo in the US trial and between either the 2. 5 mg or the 5. 0 mg dose of <b>ridogrel</b> and the 0. 5 mg dose of <b>ridogrel,</b> a surrogate dose for placebo, in the international trial.

40|$|OBJECTIVES. We {{sought to}} examine {{to what extent}} a {{combination}} of strong thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibition and moderate endoperoxide receptor blockade enhances streptokinase-induced coronary thrombolysis and provides anti-ischemic activity independent from its thrombolytic activity. METHODS. Coronary thrombi, induced by crush injury and stenosis of the coronary artery, were lysed with streptokinase, 10, 000 IU/kg body weight over 90 min, in anesthetized dogs receiving solvent (n = 11), <b>ridogrel,</b> 0. 31 mg/kg intravenously, for thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibition (n = 7) or <b>ridogrel,</b> 5 mg/kg, for additional prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonism in addition to thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibition (n = 7) 10 min before the administration of streptokinase. RESULTS. Thrombolytic efficacy was greatest in animals receiving both dual-acting <b>ridogrel,</b> 5 mg/kg intravenously, and streptokinase {{as evidenced by the}} highest incidence of high grade coronary reperfusion (solvent 3 of 11; <b>ridogrel,</b> 0. 31 mg/kg, 5 of 7; <b>ridogrel,</b> 5 mg/kg, 7 of 7; p < 0. 05 vs. solvent) within the shortest delay (solvent 210 min; <b>ridogrel,</b> 0. 31 mg/kg, 85 min; <b>ridogrel,</b> 5 mg/kg, 37 min; p < 0. 05 vs. solvent and <b>ridogrel,</b> 0. 31 mg/kg) and the lowest incidence of reocclusion (solvent 5 of 7; <b>ridogrel,</b> 0. 31 mg/kg, 2 of 7; <b>ridogrel,</b> 5 mg/kg, 1 of 7; p < 0. 05 versus solvent). Myocardial infarct size after coronary artery ligation (90 min) and subsequent reperfusion (150 min) in anesthetized dogs was 49. 3 +/- 4. 3 % versus 29 +/- 3. 9 % (p < 0. 05 vs. solvent) of the area of the left ventricle at risk in dogs receiving solvent (n = 9) or <b>ridogrel,</b> 5 mg/kg intravenously (n = 10), respectively, despite similar hemodynamic characteristics, collateral blood flow and area at risk in both groups. CONCLUSIONS. Combined thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibition and endoperoxide receptor antagonism 1) upgrades thrombolysis with streptokinase in canine coronary arteries, 2) limits myocardial infarct size after nonthrombotic coronary occlusion and reperfusion, and 3) may preserve ventricular function compromised by coronary occlusion through dual manipulation of the arachidonic acid cascade in blood and myocardial tissue, respectively. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Thromboxanes are {{produced}} in excess and platelets are activated in active Crohn's disease. Preliminary reports {{have suggested that}} <b>ridogrel,</b> a dual thromboxane synthase inhibitor and receptor antagonist, may have therapeutic benefit in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. AIMS: To investigate the efficacy of <b>ridogrel</b> in patients with active Crohn's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an international, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 5 mg/day oral <b>ridogrel</b> for 12 weeks in 85 patients with moderately active Crohn's disease. Sixty patients were randomized to receive <b>ridogrel,</b> and 25 to placebo. The Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) {{was used to assess}} disease activity: remission was defined as a CDAI < 150. Changes in clinical condition, as assessed by the Harvey-Bradshaw index, global evaluation by the investigator and the patient, and blood measures of inflammation, were used as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The patients' mean (s. d.) CDAI at recruitment was 277 (68) in the <b>ridogrel</b> treated group and 265 (70) in the placebo group. At their final assessment, 20 out of 60 (35 %) patients who had been given <b>ridogrel</b> in an intention-to-treat analysis and seven out of 25 (28 %) patients given placebo were in remission (no significant difference). No significant differences in Harvey- Bradshaw index or global evaluation were noted between patients given <b>ridogrel</b> and those given placebo. Adverse events were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: A 5 -mg dose of oral <b>ridogrel</b> was not more effective than placebo in inducing remission in patients with moderately active Crohn's disease. If thromboxane synthesis and platelet function are to be targeted for the treatment of Crohn's disease, more potent agents require development and assessment. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Thromboxane plays a {{principal}} role in platelet aggregation, {{and is a}} potent vasoconstrictor. It is now understoood, that the receptor for thromboxane (TP) responds to multiple endogenous ligands. Inhibiting the synthesis of thromboxane does not prevent functional responses mediated by TP receptors. <b>Ridogrel</b> is an investigational drug with dual activities as an antagonist of TP receptors, and an inhibitor of thromboxane synthase. Single doses of <b>ridogrel</b> ranging 1. 5 to 125 milligrams per kilogram reduced serum (platelet-derived) thromboxane B 2 synthesis, they did not affect urinary thromboxane B 2 excretion or blood pressure,in twelve-week-old Spontaneously Hypertensive Stroke-Prone Rats (SHR-SP). In contrast, repeated doses of <b>ridogrel</b> 12. 5 milligrams per kilogram every twelve hours for seven days, reduced renal thromboxane B 2 synthesis without affecting renal prostacyclin synthesis. Blood pressure was reduced despite an increase in plasma renin activity. The pressor response to the TP receptor agonist U 46, 619 was shifted to the right following <b>ridogrel</b> pre-treatment, confirming competitive TP receptor antagonism. More importantly, the pressor responses to angiotensin II and noradrenaline were also blunted by <b>ridogrel</b> pre-treatment. The reduction in vasopressor responses to those agents, following repeated administration of <b>ridogrel,</b> suggests modulation of vascular responses by a more generalized mechanism, or that a TP receptor-mediated component contributes to the contractile responses caused {{by a number of}} vasopressor agents. The dual actions of a thromboxane synthase inhibitor/TP receptor antagonist (TSI-TPA) drug such as <b>ridogrel,</b> have the potential to improve endothelial dysfunction, and attenuate TP receptor-mediated contraction. Furthermore, the redirection of arachidonic acid metabolism toward the synthesis of prostacyclin, and the enhancement of intracellular cAMP generation, would favour vasorelaxation, reduce shear stress and increase erythrocyte deformability in the micro-circulation. It remains to be proven whether any or all of these effects explain the antihypertensive response to extended treatment with <b>ridogrel.</b> Untreated twelve-week old SHR-SP excrete less urinary thromboxane B 2 than normotensive Wistar-Kyoto or Sprague-Dawley rats, suggesting that reduced renal thromboxane A 2 synthesis is a compensatory response to hypertension; a compensatory response which <b>ridogrel</b> augments. An especially attractive prospect is that TSI-TPA drugs may provide anti-platelet activity while lowering blood pressure. A subset of patients may derive additional benefit from the potential antiasthmatic, uricosuric and gastric-protective effects of <b>ridogrel...</b>|$|E

Thrombotic occlusion of the everted segment graft with a platelet-rich thrombus, persisting for at least 30 min, occurred spontaneously within 4. 3 +/- 3. 9 min (mean +/- SD). These dogs were then heparinised and randomised to 1 of 4 blinded treatment groups: double placebo infusion, bolus injections of 0. 5 mg/kg rt-PA, repeated at 15 min intervals until recanalisation occurred or up to 4 doses, <b>ridogrel</b> infusion (5 mg/kg bolus followed by continuous infusion of 5 mg/kg over 150 min), or the combination of rt-PA and <b>ridogrel.</b> In the control group, stable occlusion as measured with an electromagnetic flow probe was maintained throughout the observation period. rt-PA produced reperfusion in 3 of 5 dogs, associated with cyclic reocclusion and reflow in 1 dog. <b>Ridogrel</b> administration did not produce recanalisation {{in any of the}} animals. The combined administration of <b>ridogrel</b> and rt-PA produced stable reperfusion without reocclusion in all of 5 dogs (p < 0. 003 vs control groups), within 41 +/- 17 min. Coronary blood flow after recanalisation was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) in dogs given rt-PA and <b>ridogrel</b> (29 +/- 6 ml/min after 10 min and 30 +/- 9 ml/min after 60 min) than in dogs given rt-PA alone (10 +/- 5 ml/min after 10 min and 14 +/- 6 ml/min after 60 min). <b>Ridogrel,</b> alone or in combination with rt-PA, prolonged the template bleeding time from approximately 3. 5 min to more than 20 min, whereas rt-PA alone did not significantly affect the bleeding time.

Heparin was administered as a 10, 000 IU bolus dose before PTCA and followed by an intravenous infusion at a rate of 1, 000 IU/hour for 24 hours. Bleeding problems at the arterial entry site occurred in 13 patients, which required a blood transfusion in only 2 patients.

Coronary angiography, after 5 to 10 days, revealed a patent infarct-related vessel in all of 14 ridogrel-treated patients and in two of three control patients. The capacity of whole blood to generate thromboxane B 2 decreased to 1 % and 3 %, respectively, of baseline (P < 0. 001) at 45 minutes and 12 to 24 hours after administration of <b>ridogrel</b> (50 to 450 mg); it increased three-fold for 6 -keto-prostaglandin F 1 -alpha and prostaglandin F 2 -alpha and 25 -fold for prostaglandin E 2 (P < 0. 001).

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>ridogrel,</b> a dual {{thromboxane}} A 2 (TXA 2) synthase inhibitor and TXA 2 /prostaglandin (PG) endoperoxide receptor antagonist, on systemic and renal production of prostaglandins and on platelet TXA 2 /PG endoperoxide receptors was evaluated upon chronic administration (300 mg b. i. d. orally, for 8 and 29 days) to man. Such a medication with <b>ridogrel</b> inhibits the systemic {{as well as}} the renal production of TXA 2 as measured by the urinary excretion of 2, 3 -dinor-TXB 2 and TXB 2 respectively without inducing significant changes in systemic or renal PGI 2 production. Simultaneously with the latter effects, the production of TXB 2 by spontaneously coagulated whole blood ex vivo is inhibited (> 99 %) while that of PGE 2 and PGF 2 -alpha is largely increased. Administration of <b>ridogrel</b> causes a three- to five-fold shift to the right of concentration-response curves for U 46619 in eliciting platelet aggregation; no tachyphylaxis is observed after 29 days of treatment in this respect. Apart from a reduction of serum uric acid levels with a concomitant increase in urinary uric acid excretion during the first days of treatment, no clinically significant changes in hematological, biochemical, hemodynamic and coagulation parameters occur during the 8 days or 29 days study. The study demonstrates that <b>ridogrel</b> is a potent inhibitor of the systemic as well as renal TXA 2 synthase and an antagonist of platelet TXA 2 /PG endoperoxide receptor in man, covering full activity during 24 h at steady-state plasma level conditions without tachyphylaxis during 29 days of medication.

ANG II. Perfusate was analyzed for thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) and prostaglandin F 1 &# 945; (PGF 1 &# 945;). RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed for TXS. MAP was higher in F-HT than in M-HT after 14 days. SQ infusion reduced MAP substantially more in F-HT and OE-HT than in others. <b>Ridogrel</b> prevented increases in MAP in F/OE-HT rats, but not M/OVX-HT. Basal release of TXB 2 and PGF 1 &# 945; increased {{to a greater extent}} in F-HT than in M-HT relative to their controls. ANG II-stimulated TXB 2 and PGF 1 &# 945; release increased to a greater extent in F-HT than in M-HT. With or without ANG II, TXB 2 production in HT during PFP increased with estrogen.

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the role of}} endothelium-derived contracting factor (EDCF) in the response to endothelin- 1 in arteries with regenerated endothelium. METHODS: Rings of porcine coronary arteries, with and without endothelium of previously deendothelialized left anterior descending coronary arteries and native left circumflex coronary arteries, were suspended in conventional organ chambers for the measurement of isometric force. RESULTS: In quiescent rings of the previously deendothelialized left anterior descending coronary artery treated with the NO-synthase inhibitor nitro-L- arginine, endothelin- 1 caused contractions which were larger in rings with than that in those without endothelium. Under the same experimental conditions, in the left circumflex coronary artery, the contractions to endothelin- 1 were augmented markedly by {{the removal of the}} endothelium. In rings with endothelium of the previously deendothelialized left anterior descending coronary artery, indometacin (inhibitor of cyclooxygenase) and <b>ridogrel</b> (thromboxane A 2 receptor antagonist and inhibitor of thromboxane synthase) inhibited contractions to endothelin- 1. Dazoxiben (inhibitor of thromboxane synthase) inhibited, to the same extent as indometacin and ridogel, the response to higher concentrations of endothelin- 1. The endothelium-dependent component of the response to lower concentrations of endothelin- 1 was inhibited by indometacin and <b>ridogrel,</b> but not by dazoxiben. In rings without endothelium of both previously deendothelialized left anterior descending and native left circumflex coronary arteries, indometacin and <b>ridogrel</b> did not affect the contractions to endothelin- 1.

To document the thrombolytic potential of K 1 K 2 Pu, the thrombolytic potency and fibrin specificity were studied in a combined platelet-rich arterial eversion graft thrombosis and venous whole blood clot model in heparinized dogs (100 U/kg bolus and 50 U/kg per h infusion). Dose-response effects of bolus injections of K 1 K 2 Pu(0. 032 to 0. 25 mg/kg) were {{compared with those of}} recombinant t-PA (rt-PA) and of recombinant single chain u-PA (rscu-PA) (0. 25 to 1. 0 mg/kg each) in groups of five or six dogs, each given hcparin with or without the thromboxane synthase inhibitor/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonist <b>ridogrel.</b> Heparin and <b>ridogrel</b> {{in the absence of a}} thrombolytic agent did not produce arterial reflow or venous clot lysis in five dogs. Addition of K 1 K 2 Pu, rt-PA or rscu-PA resulted in a dose-dependent induction of arterial reflow and of venous clot lysis in the absence of systemic fibrinolytic activation and fibrinogen breakdown.

40|$|The {{chimeric}} molecule K 1 K 2 Pu, comprising the two kringle domains (K 1 and K 2) of {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (t-PA) and the COOH-terminal region with the serine protease domain (Pu) of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), was previously shown to have a 5 - to 10 -fold reduced clearance rate with maintained specific thrombolytic activity, resulting in an increased thrombolytic potency in animal models of venous and arterial thrombosis. To document the thrombolytic potential of K 1 K 2 Pu, the thrombolytic potency and fibrin specificity were studied in a combined platelet-rich arterial eversion graft thrombosis and venous whole blood clot model in heparinized dogs (100 U/kg bolus and 50 U/kg per h infusion).

40|$|Background. The {{efficacy}} of thrombolytic therapy in treating patients with {{acute myocardial infarction}} is limited by failure to achieve reperfusion in some patients, by the prolonged time required to achieve reperfusion, and by reocclusion of some coronary arteries. We designed this study to {{examine the effect of}} combined inhibition of thrombin and thromboxane synthesis and blockade of thromboxane A 2 receptors in addition to tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) on thrombolysis and reocclusion in an experi-mental canine model with coronary thrombosis. Methods and Results. Blood flow velocity in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) of 32 anesthetized mongrel dogs was monitored by a pulsed Doppler flow probe. Coronary thrombosis was induced by applying electrical stimulation to the LAD at the site where an external constrictor was used to narrow the artery. Three hours after the formation of occlusive thrombus, animals were randomly assigned to receive one of the following: 1) t-PA (80 gg/kg+ 8,ug * kg- min' 1 i. v.) and saline; 2) t-PA and hirulog, a hirudin-based synthetic peptide and specific thrombin inhibitor (2 mg/kg+ 2 mg- kg`-l hr-' i. v.); 3) t-PA and <b>ridogrel,</b> a combined thromboxane A 2 synthetase inhibitor and receptor antagonist (5 mg/kg+ 2. 5 mg kg ` hr- 1 i. v.); or 4) t-PA, hirulog, and <b>ridogrel.</b> Reperfusion developed in 14 % (one of seven) of dogs treated with t-PA alone at an average of 86 ± 4 minutes after treatment, in 78 % (seven o...|$|E
40|$|Some {{evidence}} {{indicate that}} platelets (PLTs) and leukocytes {{might contribute to}} the development of neointimal hyperplasia following arterial injury, via release of several growth factors. To study the relative contribution of these cells and of growth factors released in consequence of activation, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), isolated from the aorta of New Zealand White rabbits, were grown in Dulbecco's medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum (FCS). At 70 % confluence, SMCs were made quiescent by removing FCS from the medium. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were stimulated with activated platelets, neutrophils, lymphocytes+monocytes, whole leukocytes and platelets + whole leukocytes. Then, 1 microCi of O 3 H-thymidine were added to SMC cultures to evaluate the degree of proliferation. Relative contribution of different PLT-derived mediators to SMC growth was evaluated by adding either ketanserin, a 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist, <b>ridogrel,</b> a thromboxane A 2 (TxA 2) receptor antagonist, BN 52021, a platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist, and trapidil, a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor antagonist, or all antagonists together. SMC proliferation was significantly increased by platelet activation. This effect was reduced by adding either ketanserin, <b>ridogrel,</b> BN 52021 or trapidil. Neutrophils, lymphocytes + monocytes and whole leukocytes also increased SMC proliferation. Simultaneous stimulation of SMCs by platelets and whole leukocytes was associated with a significant increase in SMC proliferation as compared to platelets or leukocytes alone. Thus, TxA 2, 5 -HT, PAF, and PDGF all contribute to SMC proliferation in vitro. Adding all antagonist together resulted in an additive antiproliferative effect. Leukocytes are also important in SMC proliferation. Interaction between platelets and leukocytes may play a pivotal role in the modulation of this phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|Platelet-derived {{growth factors}} are {{implicated in the}} neointimal {{proliferation}} (NP) that is partly responsible for restenosis after coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Reducing platelet accumulation at PTCA sites may attenuate NP and restenosis. Single antiplatelet agents are not effective, due to multiple platelet activation pathways. Previous work suggested that combined antagonism of 2 mediators of platelet aggregation––thromboxane A 2 (by <b>ridogrel)</b> and serotonin (by ketanserin), could reduce platelet-thrombus formation and lessen NP. We therefore tested the hypothesis that combined treatment with 3 agents (<b>ridogrel,</b> kemnserin, and an ADP antagonist––clopidogrel) {{would be more effective}} in reducing NP after PTCA. We studied 18 dogs with coronary flow probes and plastic constrictors chronically implanted on LAD arteries. All dogs underwent LAD PTCA and were sacrificed after 8 weeks of monitoring. Eight dogs were controls, while 10 dogs were treated with combined anti platelet therapy for 3 weeks before and 3 weeks after PTCA. Compared to controls, ex vivo platelet aggregation was virtually abolished in treated dogs, and bleeding times during treatment were greater (> 720 vs 119 ± 4 sec, p< 0. 001). Cyclic flow variations (CFVs) after PTCA, from repetitive accumulation and dislodgement of platelet aggregates at PTCA sites, occurred in 7 / 8 controls but in only 1 / 10 treated dogs (p< 0. 01). Platelet counts and hematocrit values were not different between treated and control groups. Quantitative coronary artery histology revealed that neointimal area was threefold less in the treated group (0. 18 ± 0. 07 cm 2 vs 0. 52 ± 0. 12, P= 0. 032), as was the percent lumen stenosis (13 ± 4 % vs 40 ± 13 %, P= 0. 06).

40|$|The {{extrinsic}} coagulation pathway {{is activated}} when tissue factor (TF) is exposed {{as a consequence}} of arterial damage. TF binds to factor VII (FVII) or activated FVII (FVIIa), generating a complex that activates both FX and FIX, ultimately leading to thrombin formation. To determine whether inhibition of FVII binding to TF would result in antithrombotic effects, active site-blocked FVIIa (FVIIai) was used in a rabbit model of intravascular thrombus formation. In addition, to study the interaction between extrinsic coagulation pathway activation and platelet aggregation, in the same model of intravascular thrombus formation, recombinant human FVIIa was administered in antiplatelet-treated rabbits. Cyclic flow variations (CFVs), due to recurrent thrombus formation, were initiated by placing an external constrictor around the endothelially-injured rabbit carotid arteries (Folt's model). Carotid blood flow was measured continuously by a Doppler flow probe placed proximally to the constrictor. CFVs were induced in 29 New Zealand White rabbits. After CFVs were observed for 30 min, the animals were randomly divided in four groups: 5 animals received via a small catheter (26 G) placed proximally to the stenosis, an intra-arterial infusion of human recombinant FVIIai (0. 1 mg/kg/min for 10 min); 9 animals received AP- 1, a monoclonal antibody against rabbit TF (0. 1 mg/kg i. v. bolus); 7 animals received <b>ridogrel,</b> a dual thromboxane A 2 synthetase inhibitor and thromboxane A 2 receptor antagonist (10 mg/kg i. v. bolus); finally, 8 rabbits received aurintrycarboxilic acid (ATA), an inhibitor of platelet glycoprotein Ib/von Willebrand factor interaction (10 mg/kg i. v. bolus). FVIIai abolished CFVs in 5 of 5 animals (CFV frequency minutes 0 cycles/hour; p < 0. 05; carotid blood flow velocity minutes 106 +/- 9 % of the baseline values; NS vs baseline). AP- 1 abolished CFVs in 7 of 9 animals (CFV frequency minutes 0 cycles/hour; p < 0. 05; carotid blood flow velocity minutes 58 +/- 35 % of the baseline values; NS vs baseline). Finally, in all the animals receiving <b>ridogrel</b> or ATA CFVs were abolished (CFV frequency 0 cycles/hour; p < 0. 05 in both groups; carotid blood flow velocity, respectively 62 +/- 32 and 66 +/- 40 % of the baseline values; NS vs baseline in both groups). Thirty minutes following inhibition of CFVs, in the FVIIai treated rabbits, human recombinant FVIIa was infused, via the small catheter placed proximally to the stenosis, at the dose of 0. 1 mg/kg/min for 10 min. In the other three groups, FVIIa, at the same dose, was infused i. v. Infusion of FVIIa restored CFVs in all FVIIai treated animals and in 6 of 7 AP- 1 treated animals, thus indicating that AP- 1 and FVIIai bindings to TF was competitive and was replaced by FVIIa. Infusion of FVIIa failed to restore CFVs in <b>ridogrel</b> e ATA treated rabbits (1 of 7 and 0 of 8 rabbits, respectively), showing that activation of extrinsic coagulation by FVIIa was overcome by inhibition of platelet function. Activated partial thromboplastin time, and ex vivo platelet aggregation in response to ADP and thrombin, were not different after FVIIai infusion, while prothrombin time was slightly but significantly prolonged as compared to baseline values. Thus, FVII-VIIa {{plays an important role in}} initiating thrombus formation in vivo. Administration of FVIIai exerts a potent antithrombotic effects in this model without affecting systemic coagulation. In addition, in this model platelets exert an important role in arterial thrombosis, since in the presence of inhibition of platelet function, activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway failed to restore thrombus formation...|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} {{contributions of}} cyclooxygenase- 1 (COX- 1) versus COX- 2 to vascular biosynthesis of prostacyclin (PGI_(2)) and thromboxane (TxA_(2)) {{and the role}} of estrogen in the regulation of COX function were studied in the thoracic aorta of age-matched 14 - 16 week old female (F) and male (M) Sprague Dawley rats. We hypothesized that COX- 1 and COX- 2 contribute differentially to the synthesis of PGI_(2) and TxA_(2) in the presence of estrogen. Ovary intact (Int-F), ovariectomized (OvX-F) and OvX+estrogen-replaced (OvX+ER-F) rats were studied. Rats were sacrificed 14 days post-op, and 3 mm aortic rings were incubated in Krebs-Henseleit-bicarbonate buffer (KHB), containing either vehicle (basal), vasopressin (VP, 10 ^(- 6) M), VP+SC- 560 (SC, selective COX- 1 inhibitor, 10 ^(- 7) M), or VP+NS- 398 (NS, selective COX- 2 inhibitor, 10 ^(- 5) M). The KHB was analyzed by specific radioimmunoassays (RIA) for 6 -keto-PGF_(1 ?) (stable metabolite of PGI_(2) and TxB_(2) (stable metabolite of TxA 2). Basal PGI_(2) was similar in M and all F groups (P= 0. 19). VP-stimulated PGI_(2) in M (4, 528 ? 745) and OvX-F (4, 785 ? 773) was reduced similarly by SC and NS (P> 0. 05). Also, VP-stimulated PGI_(2) in Int-F (15, 352 ? 2, 209) and OvX-ER-F (13, 053 ? 3, 086) was reduced significantly by SC and NS (P 0. 05). VP-stimulated TxA_(2) in M (30 ? 4) and OvX-F (31 ? 7) was reduced similarly by SC and NS (P> 0. 05). VP-stimulated TxA_(2) in OvX-ER-F (71 ? 7) was reduced markedly more by NS than by SC (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, these data suggest that: 1) in the absence of estrogen in OvX-F and M, both PGI_(2) and TxA_(2) are derived equally from COX- 1 and COX- 2; and 2) in Int-F and OvX-ER-F, estrogen markedly enhances PGI_(2) and TxA_(2) production, primarily by upregulating COX- 2 function. Furthermore, the mechanism by which TxA_(2) inhibits PGI_(2) synthesis was investigated in M rats. It was hypothesized that TxA_(2) inhibits PGI_(2) through a PKC-mediated nitrosylation on PGI synthase. Aortic rings were prepared and incubated in KHB, containing either vehicle (VP, 10 ^(- 6) M), Calphostin C (CAL; PKC inhibitor, 10 ^(- 6) M), or Furegrelate (FUR; TP receptor antagonist; 50 ?M), <b>Ridogrel</b> (RID; combined TP receptor antagonist and TxS inhibitor; 10 ^(- 5) M), or Dazoxiben (DAZ; 50 ?M). The KHB was analyzed by specific RIA for 6 -keto-PGF_(1 ?) and TxB_(2). TxA_(2) release was significantly attenuated by DAZ, RID, and FUR but was markedly enhanced by CAL 228 % (0. 001 0. 05). However, PGI_(2) release was enhanced 158 % in the presence of DAZ (0. 001 <P< 0. 05). It is possible that Calphostin may inhibit a PKC-mediated homologous desensitization loop to increase TxA_(2) release. DAZ effects clearly show that TxS inhibitors increase PGI_(2) release, however, it is puzzling that <b>Ridogrel</b> did not have the same effect. While TxA_(2) does seem to have a depressing effect of PGI_(2), it is clear that PKC-mediated nitrosylation of PGI synthase is not the mechanism by which TxA_(2) inhibits PGI_(2) release...|$|E

In control rings, arachidonic acid induced contractions of WKY aorta that were not different between preparations with and without endothelium. Incubation with interleukin- 2 (10 units/mL) for 6 or 18 hours augmented the response to arachidonic acid in rings with, but not in those without, endothelium from WKY rat aortas. In the WKY aorta, both the endothelium- dependent and endothelium-independent contractions to arachidonic acid observed after incubation with interleukin- 2 were abolished by indomethacin and <b>ridogrel</b> (a thromboxane-endoperoxide receptor antagonist and a thromboxane synthase inhibitor) but were not affected by dazoxiben (a thromboxane synthase inhibitor). Interleukin- 2 did not augment the vascular reactivity of WKY aortic smooth muscle to activation of the thromboxane- endoperoxide receptor with U 46619. In aortas from SHRs, arachidonic acid evoked endothelium-dependent contraction; interleukin- 2 did not modify the response to arachidonic acid in preparations with and without endothelium. These data demonstrate that 1) endothelium-dependent contractions to arachidonic acid are observed in SHR but not in WKY rat aortas; 2) interleukin- 2 induces endothelium-dependent contractions to arachidonic acid in the WKY aorta that are mediated by an augmented release of a metabolite of cyclooxygenase, different from thromboxane A 2 but activating thromboxane- endoperoxide receptors; and 3) interleukin- 2 {{does not affect the}} endothelium- dependent and endothelium-independent response to arachidonic acid in the SHR aorta. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Objective Hypertensive rats {{are more}} {{sensitive}} to the pressor effects of acute ouabain than normotensive rats. We analyzed the effect of chronic ouabain (similar to 8. 0 mu g/day, 5 weeks) treatment on the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto rats and the contribution of vascular mechanisms. Methods Responses to acetylcholine and phenylephrine were analyzed in isolated tail arteries. Protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) were also investigated. Results Ouabain treatment enhanced blood pressure only in SHRs. The pD(2) for acetylcholine was decreased in arteries from SHRs compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats, and ouabain did not change this parameter. However, ouabain was able to increase the pD(2) to phenylephrine in SHRs. Nitric oxide synthase inhibition with N(G) -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or potassium channel blockade by tetraetylamonium increased the response to phenylephrine in SHRs, with a smaller increase in response observed in ouabain-treated SHRs. In addition, indomethacin (a COX inhibitor) and <b>ridogrel</b> (a thromboxane A(2) synthase inhibitor and prostaglandin H(2) /thromboxane A(2) receptor antagonist) decreased contraction to phenylephrine in tail rings from ouabain-treated SHRs. Protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase was unaltered following ouabain treatment in SHRs, whereas COX- 2 expression was increased. Conclusion Chronic ouabain treatment further increases the raised blood pressure of SHRs. This appears to involve a vascular mechanism, related to a reduced vasodilator influence of nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor and increased production of vasoconstrictor prostanoids by COX- 2. These data suggest that the increased plasma levels of ouabain could {{play an important role in}} the maintenance of hypertension and the impairment of endothelial function.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Platelet-vessel wall {{interaction}} {{plays an}} important role in acute cardiovascular disorders. Thrombin is a potent platelet activator but also has profound effects on the endothelium. Endothelial cells possess antithrombotic activity by releasing nitric oxide and prostacyclin, both potent vasodilators and platelet inhibitors. We studied the role of thrombin as a regulator of platelet-vessel wall interaction in isolated human arteries suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. METHODS AND RESULTS: In arteries with endothelium, thrombin (0. 01 to 1 U/mL) induced endothelium-dependent relaxations, which were reduced by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 10 (- 4) mol/L) and/or indomethacin (10 (- 5) mol/L). Human platelets (75, 000 /microL) evoked only marginal contractions in arteries with endothelium (3 +/- 3 % of the contraction to KCl 100 mmol/L; NS), which were markedly enhanced by endothelial removal (22 +/- 4 %; P <. 05). Thrombin (1 U/mL) did not affect the response to platelets in arteries with (6 +/- 5 %; NS) but induced a huge contraction in rings without endothelium (53 +/- 6 %; P <. 01 versus control without endothelium). The potent contraction to thrombin-activated platelets (1000 to 75, 000 /microL) in arteries without endothelium was markedly inhibited by the thromboxane A 2 synthetase/receptor antagonist <b>ridogrel</b> (10 (- 5) mol/L; P <. 005 versus control) and the single-acting thromboxane receptor blocker SQ- 30741 (10 (- 7) mol/L; P <. 01 versus control). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, thrombin directly stimulates platelets to release thromboxane A 2, inducing potent vasoconstriction, which is prevented by the simultaneous thrombin-induced release of prostacyclin and nitric oxide from endothelial cells. In arteries devoid of functional endothelial cells, as occurs in patients with coronary artery disease, a combined inhibition of thromboxane production and action provides a potent therapeutic tool to interfere with the thrombin-induced activation of platelet-vessel wall interaction...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Na(+), K(+) -ATPase {{activity}} {{contributes to}} the regulation of vascular contractility {{and it has been}} suggested that vascular Na(+), K(+) -ATPase activity may be altered during the progression of diabetes; however the mechanisms involved in the altered Na(+), K(+) -ATPase activity changes remain unclear. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate ouabain-sensitive Na(+), K(+) -ATPase activity and the mechanism(s) responsible for any alterations on this activity in aortas from 1 - and 4 -week streptozotocin-pretreated (50 mg kg(- 1), i. v.) rats. Main methods: Aortic rings were used to evaluate the relaxation induced by KCl (1 - 10 mM) in the presence and absence of ouabain (0. 1 mmol/L) as an index of ouabain-sensitive Na(+), K(+) -ATPase activity. Protein expression of COX- 2 and p-PKC-beta II in aortas were also investigated. Key findings: Ouabain-sensitive Na(+), K(+) -ATPase activity was unaltered following 1 -week of streptozotocin administration, but was increased in the 4 -week diabetic aorta (27 %). Endothelium removal or nitric oxide synthase inhibition with L-NAME decreased ouabain-sensitive Na(+), K(+) -ATPase activity only in control aortas. In denuded aortic rings, indomethacin. NS- 398, <b>ridogrel</b> or Go- 6976 normalized ouabain-sensitive Na(+), K(+) -ATPase activity in 4 -week diabetic rats. In addition, COX- 2 (51 %) and p-PKC-beta II (59 %) protein expression were increased in 4 -week diabetic aortas compared to controls. Significance: In conclusion, diabetes led to a time-dependent increase in ouabain-sensitive Na(+), K(+) -ATPase activity. The main mechanism involved in this activation is the release of TxA(2) /PGH(2) by COX- 2 in smooth muscle cells, linked to activation of the PKC pathway. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether {{prostaglandin}} endoperoxides, which continue to be formed in the setting of thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibition, might influence the fate of ischemic myocardium in a model of coronary occlusion and reperfusion. BACKGROUND: It was recently demonstrated that thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibitors reduce ischemic myocardial injury through a redirection of prostaglandin (PG) endoperoxides toward the synthesis of "cardioprotective" prostaglandins, such as PGI 2, PGE 2 and PGD 2. However, part of these prostaglandin endoperoxides may also stimulate a receptor, shared with thromboxane A 2, mediating platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. METHODS: New Zealand White rabbits were subjected to 30 min of coronary occlusion, followed by 5. 5 h of reperfusion. Fifteen minutes before reperfusion, the animals were randomized to receive 1) saline solution (control animals, n = 8); 2) SQ 29548, a potent and selective thromboxane A 2 /PGH 2 receptor antagonist (n = 8); 3) dazoxiben, a selective thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibitor (n = 8); 4) R 68070 (<b>Ridogrel),</b> a drug with dual thromboxane A 2 synthase-inhibiting and thromboxane A 2 /PGH 2 receptor-blocking properties (n = 8); or 5) aspirin + R 68070 (n = 8). RESULTS: Dazoxiben and R 68070, but not SQ 29548, significantly reduced thromboxane B 2 formation and increased plasma levels of 6 -keto-PGF 1 alpha, PGE 2 and PGF 2 alpha. Ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by U 46619 (a thromboxane A 2 mimetic) was inhibited by SQ 29548 and R 68070 but not by dazoxiben. In control animals, infarct size determined at the end of the experiment by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining averaged 57. 7 +/- 3. 2 % of the area at risk of infarction. The administration of SQ 29548 did not significantly reduce infarct size compared with that in control animals, whereas dazoxiben and R 68070 significantly reduced infarct size to 36. 7 +/- 2. 8 % and 16. 6 +/- 3. 6 % of area at risk of infarction, respectively (p < 0. 001 vs. control values). In rabbits treated with R 68070, infarct size was also significantly smaller than that of dazoxiben-treated rabbits (p < 0. 01). This protective effect of R 68070 was completely abolished when the drug was administered with aspirin, infarct size in this group averaging 59. 7 +/- 1. 6 % (p = NS vs. control values). No differences in regional myocardial blood flow, systemic blood pressure, heart rate or extent of area at risk were observed among groups. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, prostaglandin endoperoxides play an important role in modulating the cardioprotective effects of thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibitors. The simultaneous inhibition of thromboxane A 2 synthase and blockade of thromboxane A 2 /PGH 2 receptors by R 68070 identify a pharmacologic interaction of potential therapeutic importance...|$|E

The data from the studies for stroke, bleeding complications as well as for the combined endpoint "severe vascular events" (SVE: death or stroke or myocardial infarction) were summarised in meta-analyses. In order to include grey literature contact has been taken up with the pharmaceutical manufacturers of TAI. Results are presented in a descriptive way. Results: The medical analysis included data from 184 RCT (vs. placebo) and from 22 RCT (vs. anticoagulant drugs). The absolute reduction of IS (4. 8 % vs. 6. 6 %; p< 0, 00001) and SVE (10. 0 % vs. 12. 4 %; p< 0, 00001) were definitely higher than the absolute increase of bleeding complications (1. 6 % vs. 0. 9 %; p< 0, 00001), but relatively similar to this absolute increase in a subpopulation with a low risk for SVE. With regard to the stroke prevention, evidence of efficacy could be yielded for acetylsalicil acid (ASA), dipyridamole, cilostazol, <b>ridogrel</b> and the combination ASA with dipyridamole. ASA is less effective than anticoagulants in the prevention of ischaemic stroke in atrial fibrillation, however, it causes fewer bleeding complications. Low dosed ASA can be considered cost-effective in secondary prevention of ischemic stroke, which is not the case for clopridogrel. Dipyridamole/ASA being more effective compared with ASA alone is connected with higher acquisition costs. Discussion: The exclusive consideration of stroke prevention is limited, as well as physicians by allocation to TAI expect to avoid all thrombotic events. Since no pharmacoeconomic studies exist for the German context, the economic assessment had to be based on international evidence. Conclusions: From the medical point of view, TAI may be recommended for primary and secondary prevention of IS in patients with a high risk of severe vascular events and with low risk for bleeding complications. ASA may be also administered in patients with atrial fibrillation in case of contraindication to anticoagulation drugs. From the health economic point of view a systematic primary prophylaxis of IS with ASA cannot be recommended, whereas in secondary prophylaxis savings can be made. Neither the use of Dipyridamole/ASS nor Clopidogrel is advisable for a systematic secondary prophylaxis of IS...|$|E
