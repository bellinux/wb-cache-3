25|$|Intending {{to improve}} on the RX 550, Spectrum {{introduced}} the Beaver RX 650 in 1991, intending to place it in the Advanced Ultra-light <b>Aeroplane</b> <b>category</b> (AULA) in Canada. The RX 650 has doors that fold upwards, making it ideal for use on floats. The cockpit cage was changed to welded steel tube, from the previously used aluminum and a sprung tailwheel was added. In service the 650 quickly proved to have structural issues and its acceptance in the AULA category was rescinded by Transport Canada until the issues could be rectified. Most customer 650s were kept flying by operating them in the Basic Ultra-light <b>Aeroplane</b> <b>category.</b> Spectrum Aircraft {{went out of business}} in 1992, prior to rectifying the issues with the 650.|$|R

5000|$|The Top Gun was {{designed}} {{to comply with the}} Canadian Basic Ultralight <b>Aeroplane</b> <b>category,</b> as well as the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight category. In kit form the aircraft {{was designed}} to comply with the Canadian Amateur-built Aircraft rules as well as the US Experimental - Amateur-built aircraft rules. It features a 521 sq ft parachute-style wing, two-seats-in-tandem accommodation, four-wheeled landing gear and a single [...] Rotax 582 engine in pusher configuration. The [...] Hirth 3203, the [...] Hirth F-30 or [...] Hirth F-30ES engines were factory options. Parachute options included square or elliptical canopies of 400 to 600 sq ft. Landing gear options include skis and floats.|$|R
2500|$|The UL {{version of}} the CH 601 was {{specially}} designed for the Canadian Advanced Ultralight <b>Aeroplane</b> <b>category</b> that was introduced in 1991. Heintz {{was instrumental in the}} creation of the category as the author of the standards and used the CH 601 as a model for the category. The UL version had a reduced gross weight of 1058 lbs, the maximum allowed in the category. When the gross weight for the AULA category was increased to 1200 lbs in 2001 the CH 601 UL had its gross weight increased to the 1200 lb mark also. The UL version was supplied in 51% or 85% kit or completed form by Zenair in Canada and was designed for engines of [...] The aircraft did not neatly fit any US categories and US buyers were advised to consider the HD instead.|$|R

The company {{went out of business}} in 1992, before rectifying the deficiencies in the RX-650's design.|$|R
25|$|The {{airworthiness}} {{design requirements}} {{applicable to the}} Vickers Viscount and other safe-life transport <b>category</b> <b>aeroplanes</b> did not require retirement lives to be determined taking account of an unpredictable gross defect of the kind inflicted on the wing spar of VH-RMQ by insertion of the flared bush. Similarly, the airworthiness maintenance requirements did not require periodic inspection for fatigue cracking of the wing spars.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{the design}} choices {{of the new}} {{generation}} aircraft are moving towards {{the research and development}} of innovative technologies, aimed at improving performance as well as to minimize the environmental impact. In the current “greening” context, the morphing structures represent a very attractive answer to such requirements: both aerodynamic and structural advantages are ensured in several flight conditions, safeguarding the fuel consumption at the same time. An aeronautical intelligent system is therefore the outcome of combining complex smart materials and structures, assuring the best functionality level in the flight envelope. The Adaptive Trailing Edge Device (ATED) is a sub-project inside SARISTU (Smart Intelligent Aircraft Structures), an L 2 level project of the 7 th EU Framework programme coordinated by Airbus, aimed at developing technologies for realizing a morphing wing extremity addressed to improve the general aircraft performance and to reduce the fuel burning up to 5 %. This specific study, divided into design, manufacturing and testing phases, involved universities, research centers and leading industries of the European consortium. The paper deals with the aeroelastic impact assessment of a full-scale morphing wing trailing edge on a Large <b>Aeroplanes</b> <b>category</b> aircraft. The FE (Finite Element) model of the technology demonstrator, located in the aileron region and manufactured within the project, was referenced to for the extrapolation of the structural properties of the whole adaptive trailing edge device placed in its actual location in the outer wing. The input FE models were processed within MSC-Nastran® environment to estimate stiffness and inertial distributions suitable to construct the aeroelastic stick-beam mock-up of the reference structure. Afterwards, a flutter analysis in simulated operative condition, have been carried out by means of Sandy®, an in-house code, according to meet the safety requirements imposed by the applicable aviation regulations (paragraph 25. 629, parts (a) and (b) -(1)) ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{retirement}} {{life of the}} wing spar of a transport <b>category</b> <b>aeroplane</b> type-certificated to the safe-life principle {{is based on a}} safety factor applied to data obtained from flight tests and information about properties of the spar material. [...] The life of 11,400 flights for the Viscount inner lower boom was based on safety factors of 3.5 for the ground-air-ground cycle and 5.0 for fatigue damage due to atmospheric gusts. These safety factors were typical for this class of aeroplane. [...] A 50% reduction of mean time to failure does not adequately explain why the inner lower boom in VH-RMQ should have failed before reaching its {{retirement life}}. In anticipation that the atmospheric gust spectrum in Australia may be more severe on the Viscount than the spectrum in some other climatic zones the gust spectrum was measured during 14,000 Viscount flights in Australia before 1961. [...] The Department of Civil Aviation accepted the Viscount retirement lives as compatible with the atmospheric gust spectrum these aircraft would encounter during operations in Australia.|$|R
