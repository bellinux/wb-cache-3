40|$|With record-low {{interest}} rates, {{private equity}} has seen unparalleled activity in recent years. Though thriving, private equity firms {{have proved to}} be guilty of overleveraging their portfolio companies as general partners. The results of overleveraging have been varied. At one end, firms seem dedicated to a portfolio company’s restructuring, investing further and pledging more capital in hopes of future growth. At the other end, firms wishing to exit their investment, <b>redeem</b> <b>debt</b> previously given to a portfolio company at a premium and engage in a quick sale thereafter, leaving that company unable to satisfy its future obligations. Firms that engage in this behavior have exposed a hole in the legal framework of private equity. This Note addresses the varied results of overleveraging and advocates for enhanced fiduciary duties of the general partners and expanding the duties of the indenture trustee for pre-default behavior. These measures would prevent domestic firm general partners from engaging in improper redemptions that would prevent the portfolio company from paying its obligations...|$|R

50|$|The Solidus Bond {{utilizes}} SHA-256 elliptical encryption on a decentralized {{block chain}} {{to create and}} <b>redeem</b> <b>debt</b> instruments issued in a digital currency. The bonds are brought into existence upon command by any investor via algorithm rather than fiat. Coupon payments and bond redemption are also executed by algorithm, {{eliminating the need for}} brokerages and theoretically reducing bond duration to zero, making credit ratings obsolete. Investors choose bond size and bond maturity of seven days to 10 years. Payments are emitted from the block chain to the SwiftCoin wallet chosen by the investor at the time of bond creation. There are no commissions or fees to pay. The only requirement to purchase a Solidus Bond is a SwiftCoin wallet and a sufficient balance of the SwiftCoin digital currency to cover the face value of the bond. Bond ownership is conveyed solely through possession. There are no accounts, records, or user databases and the block chain ledger is not public. Interest rates are set by the market and were 18% in 2016. Holders of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies convert to SwiftCoin to access the Solidus Bond block chain, then cash back into their initial currency at bond expiry. Solidus Bonds are not open source. Unlike Bitcoin, Solidus Bonds cannot be mined.|$|R

In my study, it was found that Indians preferred to channel funds for philanthropy in India through friends and family because of lack of trust in formal organizations and greater confidence in the activities of friends and family in India due to familiarity and better accountability.

500|$|When state {{expenditures}} exceeded its revenues, Jennings {{preferred to}} secure the state's debts with bank loans to cover the shortfall rather than issuing treasury notes. Although taxes were levied and the state borrowed from the First State Bank of Indiana, the state's fiscal status remained bleak, worsened by the economic depression of 1819. Around 1820 federal deposits at the First State Bank were suspended and the bank's notes were no longer accepted for purchases from federal land offices. Numerous reports of corruption at the Bank of Vincennes {{and the collapse of}} land values, brought on by the panic of 1819, put the bank in further financial distress. By 1821 the bank was insolvent. In June 1822 the Knox County circuit court declared the First State Bank had forfeited its charter. In November 1823 the Indiana Supreme Court upheld the termination of the bank's charter and concluded that the First State Bank had [...] "embezzled" [...] $250,000 of federal deposits, issued more paper than it could <b>redeem,</b> had <b>debt</b> exceeding the limited allowed under its charter, established more branches than its capital and specie could support, paid shareholders large dividends, and took steps to dissolve without paying debts owed. For several years after the First State Bank's failure, Indiana citizens depended on the Bank of the United States, with a branch in Louisville, and the Farmers and Mechanics Bank of Madison for financial services. Farmers and Mechanics Banks fared better than the First State Bank of Indiana, but its charter expired on January 1, 1835, and its paper passed at depreciated rates for several years.

Firms are more likely to issue equity or <b>redeem</b> convertible <b>debt</b> during the restricted period, suggesting strong incentives for manipulation. (JEL G 12, G 14) Can firms increase their stock price by constraining the ability of investors to sell? A growing literature in finance suggests that when there are limits to arbitrage, prices may deviate from fundamentals, often for sustained periods. These papers argue that among other things, noise trader risk (De Long et al., 1990), short-sale constraints (D’Avolio, 2002; and Jones and Lamont, 2002), investor withdrawals (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997), or systematic psychological biases (Barberis and Thaler, 2004) can make investors unwilling or unable to trade against mispricing. 1 As long as there are benefits to having a high stock price, firms have strong incentives to further constrain investors from selling shares, thus bringing prices back to fundamentals. The idea that restricting trade can affect stock prices applies in a variety of settings, but is most obvious in initial public offerings (IPOs), where differences of opinion about the prospects of the firm are high. At IPO, many firms choose to offer {{only a small fraction of}} the total shares outstanding to the public, releasing a part of the float after a lockup period during which employees and some other investors are not allowed to sell.

40|$|The {{rural poor}} are {{vulnerable}} to disasters such as war, drought, floods and illness; to exploitation, and to heavy expenditure on social needs such as dowries, weddings and funerals. Their vulnerability increases as traditional supports weaken, costs rise, and their reserves, such as livestock, diminish. On the positive side, trees {{to which they have}} access or which they own, have become more valuable and easier to market. It is time trees were seen as savings and security for many of the rural poor. They can free poor farmers from insecurity by enabling them to build up reserves and meet contingencies. But for trees to be good savings for the poor, professionals have themselves to recognize their potential, and to be freed from misperceptions and representative reflexes. In the past, trees on private farms have been neglected because of foresters' concerns with field crops, and the absence of a profession with energy and fuel as its central concern. Temperate climate biases have also tended to blur recognition of the rapid rates of tree growth in many tropical conditions. Nor has it been widely appreciated how the value of trees to poor people has risen as a result of deforestation and increased demand for fuelwood and timber. In practice, poor people increasingly use trees as savings and security to deal with contingencies. As in the past, tree products are used directly to meet seasonal food and cash shortages. In many countries, the sale of firewood and charcoal continues to be a means for poor people to survive during bad times. But now, in addition, trees on private land are planted and protected by poor people as investments. In western Kenya they are planted to pay for school fees and in Benin to provide support in old age. Trees are also mortgaged, and sold to <b>redeem</b> <b>debts.</b> As savings and security, trees have advantages. They are cheap to establish, appreciate in value rapidly, are in manageable and divisible units, and often regenerate after cutting;nor are they easily begged, borrowed or stolen. In these respects they compare on balance favorably with other forms of savings such as livestock,jewellery, land and bank deposits. Trees are also increasingly cash crops for small and poor farmers. In two districts in Kenya - Kakamega and Kisli where landholdings are very small, and where aerial surveys have shown up to 30 % of the agricultural land under planted and managed tree cover, small farmers who cannot afford to plant coffee or tea, planttrees instead. Unlike most other cash crops, trees have the advantage of being convenient and harvestable for timber or firewood at any time, and so provide a 'bank balance' which can be drawn on when the need arises. A 1987 study carried out in West Bengal showed that from trees harvested under the West Bengal Group Farm Forestry Programme, 38 % of the cash was spent on buying land, 14 % on housing, 22 % on marriages, 4 % on other contingencies, and 21 % on other productive expenditure - thus confounding the poverty cynics who say that the poor will always fritter away their cash. Almost all the cash realized from the trees was used by these poor people to better their economic or social condition in some long-term manner For poor farmers {{to be able to use}} trees in these ways, it is only common sense that they need rights to their trees, just as depositors in banks need rights to withdraw cash when required. But the normal official and professional reflex is to restrict rights to cut, transport and sell trees and tree produce from private land. This is intended to serve the environment, but is self-defeating. Restrictions reduce or remove the incentive to plant and protect trees. Farmers who are insecure in their rights tend to cut and sell them when they can. ln contrast, experience in Haiti, Kenya and elsewhere shows farmers with secure rights planting and protecting trees on a large scale, confounding those who doubt poor farmers' ability to take a long view and to save. Policy makers and those engaged in policy dialogues have, then, to argue for and secure the removal of restrictions, and they must see that these removals are real and are widely known by the public. If they are successful, then a growing body of evidence suggests that small farmers will surprise the sceptics by the speed and scale of their tree planting and the restraint with which they harvest them. Conditions vary, but in many rural areas the potential seems large for trees to provide farmers with savings, security and income which could help millions to struggle up out of debt and dependence, and to gain in self-respect, independence and freedom. Trees can liberate.

50|$|In 1778 Thurlow was {{admitted}} to the Privy Council, raised to the peerage as Baron Thurlow, of Ashfield in the County of Suffolk, and appointed Lord Chancellor by Lord North. In this post he notably opposed the economical and constitutional reforms proposed by Edmund Burke and John Dunning. The Tory administration of Lord North fell in March 1782, after twelve years in office. The Whigs under Lord Rockingham came to power, but Thurlow nevertheless managed to cling on as Lord Chancellor. Rockingham died in July 1782, but Thurlow remained Lord Chancellor also when Lord Shelburne became Prime Minister. The latter government fell in April 1783, when a coalition government under Charles James Fox and Lord North was formed (with the Duke of Portland as titular Prime Minister). Thurlow was not invited to resume the role of Lord Chancellor, and instead the Great Seal was put into commission. He went into opposition and contributed to the downfall of the coalition in December 1783. William Pitt the Younger became Prime Minister and reinstated Thurlow as Lord Chancellor. The relationship between Pitt and Thurlow was always fragile, and Thurlow often relied on his friendship with King George III to be able to remain in office. He opposed a bill for the restoration to the heirs of estates forfeited in the Jacobite rising of 1745. Partly to please the king, he consistently and strongly supported Warren Hastings, and negotiated with the Whigs to ensure his continued power {{in the event of a}} change of government.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} critically examines predominant political-economic {{theories of}} public credit and public debt {{in light of}} the origins, development, and recent record expansion in such debt. Using a "history of thought" approach, I focus on those aspects of theory, from three main schools of thought - Classical, Keynesian, and Public Choice - which seek to explain the evolution of public debt, its political-economic causes and effects, the meaning of sustainability in public debt burdens, and the conditions under which governments are likely to monetize or repudiate their debts. For empirical context, I also provide three centuries of data on public debt for major nations, relative to their national income, and government bond-yield data for more recent decades. There is value in classifying the major political economists who have examined public credit and public debt since 1700 as "pessimists," "optimists" or "realists. " Public debt pessimists argue that government provides no truly productive services, that its taxing and borrowing detract from the private economy, while unfairly burdening future generations, and that high and rising public leverage ratios are unsustainable and will likely cause national insolvency and long-term economic ruin. When public debts become excessive or un-payable, pessimists advise explicit default or deliberate repudiation. Public debt pessimists also believe financiers in general and public bondholders in particular are unproductive. Pessimists usually endorse smaller-sized governments and free markets. With few exceptions, most public debt pessimists appear in the Classical or Public Choice schools of thought. Among prominent public debt pessimists, the most representative are David Hume and Adam Smith. Public debt optimists believe that government provides not only productive services, such as infrastructure and social insurance, but means to mitigate what they perceived to be "market failures," including savings gluts, economic depressions, inflation, and secular stagnation. Optimists contend that deficit-spending and public debt accumulation can stimulate or sustain economy activity and ensure full employment, without burdening present or future generation. To the extent public debts become excessive or un-payable, optimists tend to advise implicit default, by official and deliberate debasement of the national currency (inflation). As do pessimists, public debt optimists view financiers and bondholders as essentially unproductive. Optimists also defend a relatively larger economic role for the state. Almost without exception, optimists reside in the Keynesian school of political-economic thought. Among the leading optimists, the most representative are Alvin Hansen and Abba Lerner. Public debt realists contend that government can and should provide certain productive services, mainly national defense, police protection, courts of justice, and basic infrastructure, but that social and redistributive schemes tend to undermine national prosperity. Realists say public debt should fund only services and projects that help a free economy maximize its potential, and that analysis must be contextualized - i. e., related to a nation's credit capacity, productivity, and taxable capacity. According to realists, public leverage is neither inevitably harmful, as pessimists say, nor infinite, as optimists say. Realists view financiers as productive and insist that sovereigns <b>redeem</b> their public <b>debts</b> in full, on time, and in sound money. Realists favor constitutionally-limited yet energetic governments that help promote robust markets. They appear mainly in the Classical era of political-economic thought. The most representative and renowned of the public debt realists are Sir James Steuart and Alexander Hamilton. My main thesis is that public debt realists provide the most persuasive theories of public credit and public debt, and thus the most plausible interpretations of the long, fascinating history of public debt. Moreover, certain puzzles and paradoxes arising in contemporary public debt experience, among developed nations - including the recent, multi-decade trend of simultaneously rising public-leverage ratios and declining public debt yields - is explicable primarily in realist terms. In contrast, public debt pessimists and optimists alike offer unbalanced, inadequate accounts of public debt experience. Whereas pessimists are too often confused or mistaken in foreseeing an alleged "inevitable" ruin from public debt, optimists more often than not are confused and mistaken about the alleged "stimulus" attainable by large-scale deficit-spending and debt build-ups. Looking ahead, the realist perspective is likely to provide superior guideposts for maximally-accurate interpretations of public debt policies and trends. Dissertatio...|$|R
