High Availability Software can provide communications abstractions like <b>redundant</b> <b>message</b> and event queues to help active subsystems in this task. Additionally, an important concept called “checkpointing” is exclusive to highly available software. In a checkpointed system, the active subsystem identifies all of its critical state and periodically updates the standby with any changes to this state. This idea is commonly abstracted as a distributed hash table - the active writes key/value records into the table and both the active and standby subsystems read from it. Unlike a “cloud” distributed hash table (Chord (peer-to-peer), Kademlia, etc.) a checkpoint is fully replicated. That is, all records in the “checkpoint” hash table are readable so long as one copy is running. [...] Another technique, called an checkpoint, periodically saves the entire state of a program.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Flooding is a {{fundamental}} file search operation in unstructured peer-to-peer (P 2 P) file sharing systems, in which a peer starts the file search procedure by broadcasting a query to its neighbors, who continue to propagate it to their neighbors. This procedure repeats until a time-to-live (TTL) counter is decremented to 0. Flooding can seriously limit system scalability, {{because the number of}} <b>redundant</b> query <b>messages</b> grows exponentially during the message propagation. Our study shows that more than 70 percent of the generated <b>messages</b> are <b>redundant</b> in a flooding with a TTL of 7 in a moderately connected Gnutella network. Existing efforts to address this issue have been focused on limiting the use of the flooding operation. We propose a new flooding scheme, called LightFlood, with the objective of minimizing the number of <b>redundant</b> <b>messages</b> and retaining a similar message-propagating scope as that of the standard flooding. In the scheme, each peer keeps track of the connectivities of every immediate and next indirect neighbor peers, which can be acquired locally. LightFlood identifies the neighbor with the highest connectivity and uses the link to that neighbor to form a suboverlay within the existing P 2 P overlay. In LightFlood, flooding is divided into two stages. The first stage is a standard flooding with a limited number of TTL hops, where a message can spread to a sufficiently large scope with a small number of <b>redundant</b> <b>messages.</b> In the second stage, message propagating is only conducted along the suboverlay, significantly reducing the number of <b>redundant</b> <b>messages.</b> Our analysis and simulation experiments show that the LightFlood scheme provides a low-overhead broadcast facility that can be effectively used in P 2 P search. For example, compared with standard flooding with seven TTL hops, we show that LightFlood with an additional two to three hops can reduce up to 69 percen...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Flood is a {{communication}} primitive {{that can be}} initiated by the base station of a sensor network to send a copy of some message to every sensor in the network. When a flood of some message is initiated, the message is forwarded by every sensor that receives the message until the sensors decide not to forward the message any more. This uncontrolled flood can cause the forwarded messages to collide with one another, {{with the result that}} many sensors in the network do not receive any copy of the flooded message. In this paper, we present a flood protocol, called the disciplined flood protocol, that aims to reduce message collisions, avoids <b>redundant</b> <b>message</b> forwarding, and guarantees the termination of a flood without requiring any sensor to maintain any extra information.

In GSTR, each node records whether it has forwarded a reply message for a query message that the node forwarded to the destination region.

40|$|Abstract-Traditionally complex queries {{have been}} {{performed}} over unstructured P 2 P networks by means of flooding, which is inherently inefficient due to {{the large number of}} <b>redundant</b> <b>messages</b> generated. While Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) can provide very efficient look-up operations, they traditionally do not provide any methods for complex queries. By exploiting the structure inherent in DHTs we can perform complex querying over structured P 2 P networks by means of efficiently broadcasting the search query. This allows every node in the network to process the query locally, and hence is as powerful and flexible as flooding in unstructured networks, but without the inefficiency of <b>redundant</b> <b>messages.</b> While there have been various approaches proposed for broadcasting search queries over DHTs, the focus has not been on validation under churn. Comparing blind search methods for DHTs through simulation we see that churn, in particular nodes leaving the network, has a large impact on query success rate. In this paper we present novel results comparing blind search over Chord and Pastry while under varying levels of churn. We further consider how different data replication strategies can be used to enhance the query success rate...|$|R

A receiver-driven communication scheme is employed to eliminate <b>redundant</b> <b>message</b> exchanges and sender based logging is employed to ensure seamless application progress with varying processor execution speeds and routine failures.

Further, identifying the fastest replica during execution is a challenge in itself.

Implementing logical machines via the state machine approach affords free substitution of the fault tolerance method used in each site and in the wide-area replication protocol, allowing one to balance performance and fault tolerance based on perceived risk. We present a new Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol that establishes a reliable virtual communication link between logical machines.

Unfortunately, these properties come {{at the cost of}} <b>redundant</b> <b>message</b> transmissions to ensure bimodal delivery to all interested peers. In systems with high message throughput, those additional messages could pose a significant burden on the excess of required bandwidth. Furthermore, the overlays upon which message dissemination takes place are oblivious to the underlying network, or rely on posterior optimizations that bias the overlay to mimic the network topology. This contributes even more to the required bandwidth as ’undesirable ’ paths are chosen with equal probability among desired ones. In a Cloud Computing scenario, nodes tend to be aggregated in sub-nets inside a data-center or in multiple datacenters, which are connected by costlier, long-distance links. The goal of this work is, therefore, to build an overlay that approximates the structure of the physical network, while ensuring the connectivity properties desirable to ensure reliable dissemination. By having each node judiciously choose which nodes are in its dissemination list at construction time, i. e. by giving preference to local nodes, we are able to significantly reduce the number of messages traversing the long-distance links.

Consequently, they have been studied extensively in recent years [1], [2]. However, current methods are designed for centralized systems, and rely on the graph embedding for effective pruning and indexing. As graph sizes become very large and graph data must be deployed in the distributed environment, these techniques become impractical. In this work, we propose a solution for efficient parallel processing of distance join queries over distributed large graphs. There have been emerging efforts devoted to managing large graphs in distributed and parallel systems. Programming models like Pregel [3] and iterative computing framework like HaLoop [4] have been proposed to handle queries over distributed graphs. However, they are designed in the perspective of functionality instead of the query efficiency. In this work, we define an optimization problem: combining the iterative join and the graph exploration method to minimize the evaluation time of distance join queries. Without sacrificing a system's scalability, our technique exploits a light-weight vertex centric encoding schema built on a distance-aware partition of the entire graph.
