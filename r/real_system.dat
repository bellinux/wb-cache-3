25|$|A {{system with}} an {{intermediate}} quality factor (Qnbsp&=nbsp&) {{is said to}} be critically damped. Like an overdamped system, the output does not oscillate, and does not overshoot its steady-state output (i.e., it approaches a steady-state asymptote). Like an underdamped response, the output of such a system responds quickly to a unit step input. Critical damping results in the fastest response (approach to the final value) possible without overshoot. <b>Real</b> <b>system</b> specifications usually allow some overshoot for a faster initial response or require a slower initial response to provide a safety margin against overshoot.|$|E
25|$|As can be seen, the semi-implicit method can {{simulate}} correctly both stable {{systems that}} have their roots in the left half plane and unstable {{systems that have}} their roots in the right half plane. This is clear advantage over forward (standard) Euler and backward Euler. Forward Euler tends to have less damping than the <b>real</b> <b>system</b> when the negative real parts of the roots get near the imaginary axis and backward Euler may show the system be stable even when the roots are in the right half plane.|$|E
25|$|It {{follows from}} {{theory that the}} Kalman filter is the optimal linear filter in cases where a) the model {{perfectly}} matches the <b>real</b> <b>system,</b> b) the entering noise is white (uncorrelated) and c) the covariances of the noise are exactly known. Several methods for the noise covariance estimation have been proposed during past decades, including ALS, mentioned in the section above. After the covariances are estimated, {{it is useful to}} evaluate the performance of the filter; i.e., whether it is possible to improve the state estimation quality. If the Kalman filter works optimally, the innovation sequence (the output prediction error) is a white noise, therefore the whiteness property of the innovations measures filter performance. Several different methods can be used for this purpose. If the noise terms are non-Gaussian distributed, methods for assessing performance of the filter estimate, which use probability inequalities or large-sample theory, are known in the literature.|$|E

2500|$|Like Kant and Bergson, Deleuze {{considers}} traditional {{notions of}} space and time as unifying forms imposed by the subject. He therefore concludes that pure difference is non-spatio-temporal; it is an idea, what Deleuze calls [...] "the virtual". (The coinage refers to Proust's definition of what is constant in both the past and the present: [...] "real without being actual, ideal without being abstract.") While Deleuze's virtual ideas superficially resemble Plato's forms and Kant's ideas of pure reason, they are not originals or models, nor do they transcend possible experience; instead they are the conditions of actual experience, the internal difference in itself. [...] "The concept they [...] form is identical to its object." [...] A Deleuzean idea or concept of difference is therefore not a wraith-like abstraction of an experienced thing, it is a <b>real</b> <b>system</b> of differential relations that creates actual spaces, times, and sensations.|$|E

2500|$|Vibrational motion {{could be}} {{understood}} in terms of conservation of energy. In the above example the spring has been extended by a value of x and therefore some potential energy (...) is stored in the spring. Once released, the spring tends to return to its un-stretched state (which is the minimum potential energy state) and in the process accelerates the mass. At the point where the spring has reached its un-stretched state all the potential energy that we supplied by stretching it has been transformed into kinetic energy (...) [...] The mass then begins to decelerate because it is now compressing the spring and in the process transferring the kinetic energy back to its potential. Thus oscillation of the spring amounts to the transferring back and forth of the kinetic energy into potential energy. In this simple model the mass continues to oscillate forever at the same magnitudeâ€”but in a <b>real</b> <b>system,</b> damping always dissipates the energy, eventually bringing the spring to rest.|$|E
