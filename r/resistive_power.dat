In AC/DC equipment, the heaters of all the tubes are connected in series.

If necessary, resistance (which can be a ballast tube (barretter), a power resistor or a resistive mains lead are added so that, when the mains voltage is applied across the chain, the specified heating current flows. Some types of ballast resistors were built into an envelope like a tube that was easily replaceable. With mains voltages of around 220 V, the power dissipated by the additional resistance and the voltage drop across it could be quite high, and it was common to use a <b>resistive</b> <b>power</b> cable (mains cord) of defined resistance, running warm, rather than putting a hot resistor inside the case.
