The oceans’s response to the atmosphere change and climate change can be determined by <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves.</b> In addition, <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> have significant theoretical meaning and real value in the atmosphere and ocean. In recent years, more and more researchers have focused on the study of <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> [1 – 4]. Many studies on <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> have been conducted in the zonal area, and many meaningful results have been achieved [5, 6]. However, as everyone knows, the propagation of <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> happens in the earth which is a spherical area [7], so the above mentioned achievements could not be directly applied. It is necessary to discuss the propagation characteristic of (3 + 1)-dimensional <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> in the spherical area under the influence of dissipation.

30|$|With the {{development}} of soliton theory, <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> have been becoming an important research direction {{in the field of}} the nonlinear partial differential [8 – 10]. In recent years, some weakly nonlinear models for the evolution of <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> have been extensively studied [11 – 13]. More importantly, some methods are found to study the nonlinear models [14 – 18] and some significant properties are discussed [19 – 23]. In the past, <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> were often studied in the zonal area. However, <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> are prominently affected via the rotation effect of the earth. Therefore, in order to study some propagation characteristics of <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves,</b> we use the (3 + 1)-dimensional quasi-geostrophic vorticity equation with dissipation effect in the cylindrical coordinate to describe the dynamic behavior of <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves.</b>|$|R
500|$|A {{low-pressure}} area, low, {{or depression}} is a region on the topographic map where the atmospheric pressure {{is lower than}} that of surrounding locations. [...] Low-pressure systems form under areas of wind divergence that occur in the upper levels of the troposphere. [...] The formation process of a low-pressure area is known as cyclogenesis. [...] Within the field of meteorology, atmospheric divergence aloft occurs in two areas. [...] The first area is {{on the east side of}} upper troughs, which form half of a <b>Rossby</b> <b>wave</b> within the Westerlies (a trough with large wavelength that extends through the troposphere). [...] A second area of wind divergence aloft occurs ahead of embedded shortwave troughs, which are of smft within the troposphere below, which lowers surface pressures as upward motion partially counteracts the force of gravity.|$|E
500|$|Jet streams are {{typically}} continuous over long distances, but discontinuities are common. The {{path of the}} jet typically has a meandering shape, and these meanders themselves propagate eastward, at lower speeds {{than that of the}} actual wind within the flow. Each large meander, or wave, within the jet stream is known as a <b>Rossby</b> <b>wave</b> (planetary wave). Rossby waves are caused by changes in the Coriolis effect with latitude. Shortwave troughs, are smaller scale waves superimposed on the Rossby waves, with a scale of [...] long, that move along through the flow pattern around large scale, or longwave, [...] "ridges" [...] and [...] "troughs" [...] within Rossby waves. Jet streams can split into two when it encounters an upper-level low, that diverts a portion of the jet stream under its base, while the remainder of the jet moves by to its north.|$|E

5000|$|Once the {{frequency}} relation is formulated {{in terms of}} ω, the angular frequency, the problem can be solved with 3 distinct solutions. These three solutions correspond to the equatorially trapped gravity wave, the equatorially trapped <b>Rossby</b> <b>wave</b> and the mixed Rossby-gravity wave (which {{has some of the}} characteristics of the former two) [...] [...] Equatorial gravity waves can be either westward- or eastward-propagating, and correspond to n=1 (same as for the equatorially trapped <b>Rossby</b> <b>wave)</b> on a dispersion relation diagram ("w-k" [...] diagram). At n = 0 on a dispersion relation diagram, the mixed Rossby-gravity waves can be found where for large, positive zonal wave numbers (+k), the solution behaves like a gravity wave; but for large, negative zonal wave numbers (&minus;k), the solution appears to be a <b>Rossby</b> <b>wave</b> (hence the term Rossby-gravity waves). [...] As mentioned earlier, the group velocity (or energy packet/dispersion) is always directed toward the east with a maximum for short waves (gravity waves).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Rossby</b> <b>wave</b> {{instability}} {{occurs because}} of the local wave trapping in a disc. It {{is related to the}} Papaloizou and Pringle instability; where the wave is trapped between the inner and outer radii of a disc or torus.|$|E
50|$|In {{the vortex}} <b>Rossby</b> <b>wave</b> hypothesis, the waves travel {{radially}} {{outward from the}} inner vortex. The waves amplify angular momentum at a radius that {{is dependent on the}} radial velocity matching that of the outside flow. At this point, the two are phase-locked and allow the coalescence of the waves to form a secondary eyewall.|$|E
50|$|The special {{identifying}} {{feature of}} <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> {{is that the}} phase velocity of each individual wave always has a westward component, but the group velocity can be in any direction.

40|$|<b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> are an {{important}} part of the ocean's response to changes in atmospheric stimuli, and provide a mechanism by which the west of ocean basins learns of changes in the east.

Here we examine the signature of <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> from a number of different sensors and discuss the extra information gained from such synergistic observations...|$|R
50|$|Research {{has shown}} that trapped {{equatorial}} <b>Rossby</b> <b>wave</b> packets can {{increase the likelihood of}} tropical cyclogenesis in the Pacific Ocean, as they increase the low-level westerly winds within that region, which then leads to greater low-level vorticity.

50|$|Most {{investigations}} of <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> {{has been done}} on those in Earth's atmosphere. <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> in the Earth's atmosphere are easy to observe as (usually 4-6) large-scale meanders of the jet stream. When these deviations become very pronounced, masses of cold or warm air detach, and become low-strength anticyclones and cyclones, respectively, and are responsible for day-to-day weather patterns at mid-latitudes. The action of <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> partially explains why eastern continental edges, such as the Northeast United States and Eastern Canada, are colder than Western Europe at the same latitudes.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> on an eastward jet such as the Kuroshio or Gulf Stream Extensions, a series of numerical experiments is conducted using a primitive equation model. In these experiments, an inflow and an outflow imposed on the western and eastern boundaries drive an unstable narrow jet and a broad interior flow in the western and eastern regions of the model domain, respectively. The barotropic <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> are radiated from the transient region between the two regions. The eddy potential vorticity flux by the waves tends to compensate for the difference in the mean potential vorticity along mean streamlines between both sides of the transient region. Instability of the jet is insufficient for this compensation and weakens the mean potential vorticity gradient too much. Moreover, as the potential vorticity of the outflow is increased, the <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> are intensified in order to compensate for the increase in the difference in the mean potential vorticity. These features strongly suggest that the <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> are substantial in matching a jet with an interior flow. The speed of the waves and properties of eddies in recirculations of the jet are consistent with a two-layer analytic model, which indicates that the <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> are radiated from eddies in recirculations. These eddies as well as the <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves</b> increase in amplitude with the transport of the recirculation near the surface presumably because of mean advection. Therefore, the mean potential vorticity of the interior flow, the intensity of the <b>Rossby</b> <b>waves,</b> and the transport of the recirculation change consistently with one another...|$|R
