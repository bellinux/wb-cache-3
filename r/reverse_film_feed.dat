The overall objective in Briefel's article, Monster Pains: Masochism, Menstruation, and Identification in the Horror Film, is that the female monster is unable to control their emotions when pain occurs whereas male monsters are unable to feel pain.|$|R

40|$|TiO 2 and MgF 2 {{thin films}} were {{prepared}} by sol-gel processing. Their microstructure was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and ellipsometric porosimetry {{as a function}} of the number of coating-firing cycles with different single layer thicknesses. TiO 2 /MgF 2 multilayers were processed in different stacking sequences; the nucleation of the subsequent material was correlated to the underlying crystal structure and the respective film morphology. It was found that dense crystalline MgF 2 films on glass can be manufactured by homoepitaxial growth of multiple thin layers. On an underlying TiO 2 layer the effect of densification and crystallization is increased. In the <b>reverse</b> <b>film</b> order no such effect could be observed...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the ability of taking and {{processing}} of intraoral periapical radiographs (IOPA) by the dental college undergraduate students and also to evaluate the impact of teaching on their skills. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted in the OMRD department. Final year students (52) and interns (41) of 2014 were included in this study. In this 1 year study, 13104 IOPAs were taken and manually processed by these students. These radiographs were evaluated by two senior faculties of the department separately. To check variability between two examiners, ANOVA test was performed and all data were analyzed using WINDOW'S SPSS version 12 (Microsoft, USA). Results: Of 13104 IOPAs, 3538 were considered as faulty radiographs, of this 26. 1 % cone cut which occupies the first position and was followed by improper vertical angulation (25. 2 %), film position error (23. 2 %), improper horizontal angulation (13. 1 %), processing errors (9. 5 %), and miscellaneous such as <b>reversed</b> <b>film,</b> film bending (2. 9 %). Conclusion: Considering the statistical analysis by increasing experience, students make fewer numbers of errors...|$|R

5000|$|Serratia marcescens [...] is {{a species}} of {{rod-shaped}} gram-negative bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae. A human pathogen, S. marcescens is involved in hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), particularly catheter-associated bacteremia, urinary tract infections and wound infections, and is responsible for 1.4% of HAI cases in the United States. It is commonly found in the respiratory and urinary tracts of hospitalized adults and in the gastrointestinal system of children. Due to its abundant presence in the environment, and its preference for damp conditions, S. marcescens is commonly found growing in bathrooms (especially on tile grout, shower corners, toilet water line, and basin), where it manifests as a pink, pink-orange, or orange discoloration and slimy <b>film</b> <b>feeding</b> off phosphorus-containing materials or fatty substances such as soap and shampoo residue.|$|R

40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{development}} of integrated Co rich CoPtP hard magnetic material for MEMS applications such as Electromagnetic Vibration Energy Harvesting. We report a new method of electrodeposition compared to the conventional DC plating, involving a combination of forward and reverse pulses for optimized deposition of Co rich CoPtP hard magnetic material. This results in significant improvements in the microstructure of the developed films as the pulse <b>reverse</b> plated <b>films</b> are smooth, stress free and uniform. Such improvements in the structural properties {{are reflected in the}} hard magnetic properties of the material as well. The intrinsic coercivities of the pulse <b>reverse</b> deposited <b>film</b> are more than 6 times higher for both in-plane and out-of-plane measurement directions and the squareness of the hysteresis loops also improve due to the similar reasons...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The belt-finishing {{process is}} a recent {{manufacturing}} technique in industry, the mechanisms and characteristics of which {{have not yet been}} fully explained. This paper attempts to make a contribution {{to the understanding of the}} consequences of the process on the surface roughness of surfaces prepared by hard turning. Abrasive film wear and contact parameters between grains and surfaces are analysed. The effects and significant interactions of the most influential belt-finishing parameters on the surface roughness are then investigated. It was shown that the applied force and the hardness of the roller have a great influence on the surface roughness. Furthermore, the <b>film</b> <b>feed</b> rate influences considerably the wear of grains and, as a consequence, this parameter has an important impact on the material removal mode and on the surface roughness...|$|R

40|$|Stigma {{proves to}} be a serious barrier for {{individuals}} living with mental illness, and research has shown that the media heavily contribute to and support damaging stereotypes about individuals with mental illness. This study examined how current <b>films</b> <b>feed</b> into fears about mental illness, especially the stereotype that individuals with serious mental illness are violent. A population of films released from 1990 [...] 2010 containing a character with schizophrenia or a related disorder was compiled and 30 films were randomly selected for viewing from this list. The films were scored for acts of violence committed by characters with and without mental illness, and the acts of violence were coded for severity. This study found that characters with mental illness committed significantly more acts of violence than characters without mental illness did. The significance of these findings along with recurring themes found in the movies are discussed in this paper...|$|R
5000|$|Toby Philpott {{was called}} {{to work on the}} 1986 Frank Oz film Little Shop of Horrors, where he was among a team of people who {{operated}} the animatronic plant that, in the <b>film,</b> <b>feeds</b> on human blood. The limbs were operated by gimbals and Philpott controlled the right-hand leaf of the plant, which he has described as [...] "quite heavy work." [...] Philpott was also an understudy to the puppeteers who operated the plant's lips. The plant increased in size throughout the movie and, at its largest incarnation, Philpott controlled one of the tentacles. However, that sequence was cut from the theatrical release when audiences responded negatively to the ending, in which the plant ate all the major characters and destroyed the city. The filmmakers created a new, more upbeat ending, and Philpott was out of town and unavailable for the plant's new scenes.|$|R

The squid was about [...] long and was missing its feeding tentacles, likely from a failed attack by a sperm whale.

50|$|A {{variety of}} largely {{proprietary}} gauges were devised for the numerous camera and projection systems being developed independently {{in the late}} 19th century and early 20th century, ranging from 13 mm to 75 mm (0.51-2.95 in), {{as well as a}} variety of <b>film</b> <b>feeding</b> systems. This resulted in cameras, projectors, and other equipment having to be calibrated to each gauge. The 35 mm width, originally specified as 1.375 inches, was introduced in 1892 by William Dickson and Thomas Edison, using 120 film stock supplied by George Eastman. Film 35 mm wide with four perforations per frame became accepted as the international standard gauge in 1909, and remained by far the dominant film gauge for image origination and projection until the advent of digital photography and cinematography, despite challenges from smaller and larger gauges, because its size allowed for a relatively good trade-off between the cost of the film stock {{and the quality of the}} images captured.|$|R
