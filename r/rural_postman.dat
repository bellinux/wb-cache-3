50|$|This {{problem is}} named after the postman and his {{challenge}} to deliver mail in any order he may choose, but minimizing his costs such as time or travel distance. It is also sometimes called the undirected chinese postman problem. The undirected <b>rural</b> <b>postman</b> problem (URPP) aims to minimize {{the total cost of}} a route that maps the entire network, or in more specific cases, a route that maps every edge that requires a service. If the whole network must be mapped, the route that maps the entire network is called a covering tour. In the case where only certain edges need to be mapped, the problem aims to solve the route that optimizes the demands, crossing over into non-required routes a minimal number of times.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of formal}} methods allows {{automated}} generation and optimization of test sequences. Developing formal methods for generating communications protocol conformance tests has drawn considerable attention in recent years.

Some related graph theoretic optimization techniques for the Chinese Postman Problem (CPP) and <b>Rural</b> Chinese <b>Postman</b> Problem (RCPP) are applied to T-method and UIO-method respectively to determine minimum-cost test sequences. It is shown in this thesis that {{the solution to the}} RCPP can also be applied to D-method and W-method to derive minimum-cost test sequences.

40|$|The {{objective}} of protocol testing is {{to confirm that}} a protocol implementation under test conforms to its specification. However, in protocol test architectures that utilize multiple remote testers in a distributed environment, this objective can be {{complicated by the fact}} that testers may encounter problems relating to controllability and observability during the application of a test sequence. Solutions in literature to these problems usually involve first generating a test sequence from the specification of an implementation under test, then inserting coordination messages or appending selected test subsequences that will allow the testers to solve the controllability and observability problems. This thesis proposes a method that uses a set of transformation rules to construct a directed graph from a given specification. A transition tour of this directed graph based on a <b>rural</b> Chinese <b>postman</b> tour will result in a test sequence with no potential for controllability or observability problems, and where the use of coordination messages is either minimized or, if possible, avoided altogether...|$|R
40|$|For {{the general}} case, we give lower bounds (i. e., approximations to the {{greatest}} lower bound (GLB)) {{on the length of}} test sequences generated by any D-method without overlapping test segments as well as by any method employing a W-set (W-method) without overlapping test segments. We then establish a lower bound (i. e., an approximation to the GLB) on the length of test sequences generated by any D-method (or W-method) that overlaps test segments. It is observed that the reduction in the length of test sequences generated by any D-method (or W-method) due to overlapping is significant. Thus, two types of efficient algorithms based on overlapping test segments are established for both a method employing a distinguishing sequence and a method employing a W-set. The first type of efficient algorithms utilize the maximum-cardinality minimum-cost matching algorithm. The second type of efficient algorithms utilize the <b>rural</b> Chinese <b>postman</b> tour algorithm. Moreover, the sufficiency conditions for the second type of algorithms to find a minimum length test sequence is polynomial time are indicated. Furthermore, the sufficiency conditions for the second type of algorithms to achieve the optimal length test sequences are discussed. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{a variant of}} the {{directed}} <b>rural</b> <b>postman</b> problem (RPP) where profits are associated with arcs to be served, and incompatibility constraints may exist between nodes and profitable arcs leaving them.

The problem looks for a tour starting and ending at the depot that maximizes the difference between collected profits and total cost as sum of traveling costs and paid penalties, while satisfying remaining incompatibilities. The problem finds application in the domain of road transportation service, and in particular in the context of horizontal collaboration among carriers and shippers.

50|$|Tati's {{first major}} feature, Jour de fête (The Big Day), {{tells the story}} of an inept <b>rural</b> village <b>postman</b> who {{interrupts}} his duties to inspect the traveling fair that has come to town. Influenced by too much wine and a documentary on the rapidity of the American postal service, he goes to hilarious lengths to speed his mail deliveries aboard his bicycle. Tati filmed it in 1947 in the village of Sainte-Sévère-sur-Indre where he had found refuge during the war. Due to the reluctance of French distributors, Jour de fête was first successfully released in London in March 1949 before obtaining a French release on 4 July 1949, where it became a great public success, receiving the 1950 Le Grand prix du cinéma français. The film was intended to be the first French feature film shot in colour; Tati simultaneously shot the film in black and white as an insurance policy. The newly developed Thomson colour system proved impractical, as it could not deliver colour prints. Jour de fête was therefore released only in black and white. Unlike his later films, it has many scenes with dialogue, and offers a droll, affectionate view of life in rural France. The colour version was restored by his younger daughter, film editor and director Sophie Tatischeff, and released in 1995. The film won the Prize for Best Original Script at the Venice Film Festival.|$|R
40|$|Software {{needs to}} be {{adequately}} tested {{in order to increase}} the confidence that the system being developed is reliable. However, testing is a complicated and expensive process. Formal specification based models such as finite state machines have been widely used in system modelling and testing. In this PhD thesis, we primarily investigate fault detection and identification when testing from finite state machines. The research in this thesis is mainly comprised of three topics - construction of multiple Unique Input/Output (UIO) sequences using Metaheuristic Optimisation Techniques (MOTs), the improved fault coverage by using robust Unique Input/Output Circuit (UIOC) sequences, and fault diagnosis when testing from finite state machines. In the studies of the construction of UIOs, a model is proposed where a fitness function is defined to guide the search for input sequences that are potentially UIOs. In the studies of the improved fault coverage, a new type of UIOCs is defined. Based upon the <b>Rural</b> Chinese <b>Postman</b> Algorithm (RCPA), a new approach is proposed for the construction of more robust test sequences. In the studies of fault diagnosis, heuristics are defined that attempt to lead to failures being observed in some shorter test sequences, which helps to reduce the cost of fault isolation and identification. The proposed approaches and techniques were evaluated with regard to a set of case studies, which provides experimental evidence for their efficacy.

An Enhanced Algorithm for Protocol Conformance Test Sequence Generation Based on the UIO Method. (December 1993) Ravindra Allada, B. E., Osmania University, Hyderabad, India Chair of Advisory Committee: Dr. Hosame Abu-Amara A computer protocol is a standard set of rules with which the computer systems on a computer network communicate. Each protocol specification may lead to different possible implementations. This implies that the protocol implementation should be checked for conformance to its specification. This checking procedure is called conformance testing. There are four methods for protocols conformance testing namely, the T-Method, D-Method, U-Method, and W-Method. Except for the T-Method, all the other methods follow the same pattern of generating test subsequences. A test subsequence checks the partial behavior of a protocol. Using the test subsequences, a test sequence can be constructed by using one of these methods, namely, reset transition method, optimization method, and heuristics. The main purpose of any protocol conformance testing method is to generate a smaller length test sequence without loss of fault coverage. In this thesis, a test generation method based on multiple unique input/output sequences (UIOS) and the <b>rural</b> Chinese <b>postman</b> tour algorithm was developed with fault detection capability to detect double type 2 faults...|$|R
