5|$|I-165 {{returned}} {{twice to}} Australian waters. In September 1943, {{she made an}} uneventful reconnaissance of the north west coast. I-165 conducted another <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrol</b> off north western Australian between 31 May and 5 July 1944. This {{was the last time}} a Japanese submarine entered Australian waters.|$|E
5|$|In the American Civil War, {{camouflage}} paint was applied {{by both sides}} during the Union blockade of 1861–1865. Blockade runners aiding the Confederates sometimes painted their ships all in mist-gray, to hide themselves in coastal fog. One Union blockade crew may have painted their rowboat white, and its oars, and wore white clothing for a night <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrol</b> up an enemy-held river.|$|E
5|$|Steiner was {{not present}} during the bombing, but at a command bunker in Franceville-Plage. After the raid, he {{set out for the}} battery, but was unable to gain entry due to the volume of fire from the British paratroopers. At the same time, a <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrol</b> from an army Flak unit with a {{half-track}} mounting a large anti-aircraft gun arrived. The crew had intended to seek cover at the position, but instead used the gun to engage the paratroopers.|$|E

5|$|The Turkish force withdrew towards Katia, {{which by}} the time the {{regiment}}'s <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrol</b> got there had been abandoned; the Turks were heading towards Oghratina. Once the enemy were located, the regiment kept patrols in contact with them overnight and all during the next day while the Turks withdrew to Negilia. By 8 August the enemy had reached Bir el Abd, where they established defences and were waiting for the New Zealanders.|$|E
5|$|A <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrol</b> {{from the}} 13th Parachute Battalion {{reported}} a large gathering of Germans in Bréville and suspected an attack was imminent. At 08:00 a massive artillery and mortar bombardment fell along the 1st Special Service Brigade lines, while the 857th Grenadier Regiment, which had {{gathered in the}} village, attacked No. 6 Commando. By 10:30, the attack on No. 6 Commando had been driven back, but to their left at Hauger No.4 Commandos had to win a hand-to-hand fight before the Germans withdrew. Twice more during the day the commandos were attacked unsuccessfully, from Sallenelles {{in the north and}} again from Bréville.|$|E
5|$|In late November 1916, the 34th Battalion {{was shipped}} to France for {{service on the}} Western Front. Initially posted to the Armentières sector in Belgium, the {{battalion}} {{did not participate in}} its first major battle until June 1917, when it took part in the Battle of Messines after the British and Dominion operations switched to the Ypres sector of Belgium. During the engagement, Jeffries received a bullet wound to the thigh while leading a <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrol</b> and was evacuated to the 3rdGeneral Hospital in London. While recuperating, he was promoted to captain on 26 June, before rejoining his battalion in September as a company commander.|$|E
50|$|The {{battalion}} {{was founded}} on July 1, 1943 from the existing long range <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrols</b> (Kaukopartiot).|$|R
50|$|SissiOs./5.D was {{rounded up}} by Second Lieutenant V.I. Laajoki from the 51 volunteers he {{recruited}} from the 5th Division sub-units (e.g. JR 22). In the autumn of 1941 SissiOs./5.D did short <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrols</b> in the recently captured areas by the Svir River (Свирь, Svir, Syväri, Sviri). From the beginning of 1942 Detachment took part on longer <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrols,</b> independently and together with other Sissi Detachments.|$|R

5|$|The Dallachy Wing was {{on alert}} to attack any ships {{found by the}} <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrol.</b> Although the group of five {{merchant}} ships were highly vulnerable to attack and a worthwhile target, Coastal Command came under the operational command of the Admiralty and was bound by its decision to give higher priority to attacking warships than merchant vessels. As a result, the wing was dispatched against Z33 even though the destroyer and its escorts were well protected and {{in a difficult position}} for aircraft to attack.|$|E
5|$|On 21 November, {{reinforcements}} {{had reached}} {{them and the}} decision was made to move the commandos to La Calle by rail. With only intermittent air cover, the train was attacked by German fighters and No. 6 Commando suffered heavy casualties with 11 killed and 32 wounded. After the train driver jumped from the engine, one of the commandos took over the duties of driving the train. The unit remained in La Calle until 26 November, during which time the commandos were used to unload stores from the ships in the port, while half the unit carried out a <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrol</b> near Tabarka, to determine whether the German tanks that were parked there were real or decoys.|$|E
5|$|On {{the desert}} flank, 2RTR {{advanced}} with the 7th Armoured Brigade group. During the morning, reports were received {{of up to}} 30 German armoured vehicles operating nearby, and ASquadron 2RTR moved to investigate. Most of the German force had pulled back, but three tanks were located and brought under fire. One Panzer IV was disabled {{and the other two}} driven off, for the loss of one British tank due to mechanical failure. A second force of 15 German tanks was engaged by two tanks of No2 Troop, destroying a Panzer III and forcing the remainder to withdraw. By midday, the brigade group had reached a position west of Fort Capuzzo, and in the afternoon the nine remaining cruisers of ASquadron 2RTR began a <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrol</b> towards Sidi Azeiz.|$|E

5|$|Early on 14 November, in the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Mughar Ridge, a <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrol</b> to Et Tine found it had been evacuated and the 12th occupied the town. In doing so, they secured a water source and a quantity of supplies, although a large amount of equipment was lost to a fire that had been set by the withdrawing garrison. The 12th then took up an observation position at El Dhenebbe to support the British flank before moving to Wadi Menakh on 18 November to water their horses. They were then ordered to launch an attack around Latron during the Battle of Nebi Samwil, but after moving to Abu Shushen where they dismounted, the regiment was recalled to Junction Station. From there, the following day amidst heavy rain they moved to Deiran. Three days later, the 12th encamped at Mejdel for a week of rest along with the majority of the Australian Mounted Division. After a brief respite, as the 4th Light Horse Brigade was sent to El Burj to relieve British forces there, the 12th went into reserve; the horses were sent back to Deiran, and dismounted patrols and reconnaissance parties were sent out.|$|E
5|$|On 23 August a <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrol</b> {{from the}} 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles crossed the River Touques by boat, but German {{resistance}} in the area was too heavy for the battalion to cross. Instead they moved upriver, intending to cross at Bonnerville sur Touques. Intelligence reported that the railway embankment on the river was held in force by the Germans, and this put attempts to cross the river there on hold. Elsewhere the 2nd Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry reached the river. Major John Howard and his D Company swam across and established the battalion's bridgehead. With local French assistance {{and a collection of}} small boats and rafts, the rest of the battalion were also able to cross the river, entering Touques on 24August. The next day they liberated Saint Philibert, La Correspondence and Petiville, and reached Malhortie where the Germans were still defending the bridge and high ground. At 13:00, the battalion assaulted and captured the bridge intact, but German resistance prevented them from proceeding any further. On 26August the advance continued, and at 19:00 Foulbec was liberated. Circumstances had divided the 6th Airlanding Brigade's forces, and they were now advancing along two routes, with the Belgian and Dutch brigades along the coast and the airlanding battalions further inland. The 6th Airlanding Brigade battalions headed towards Honfleur and Berville sur Mer, meeting slight German opposition, while the Belgians occupied the area around Berville and Foulbec.|$|E
5|$|On 7June the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion at Le Mesnil was {{attacked}} by units from the 857th and 858th Grenadier Regiments, supported by tanks and self-propelled guns. The battalion inflicted heavy casualties on the Germans, but only managed to drive them back with a bayonet charge by 'B' Company. The next day the battalion was involved in several small battles, and on the 9June sent a <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrol</b> to check if the Germans were still occupying Bavent. The patrol was driven back by a strong German force, but that night another patrol entered the village and planted explosive charges on weapons and in buildings. Attacks by German infantry and armour continued until {{the night of the}} 12/13June, when Bréville was finally captured by the division's only reserves, a mixed force from the 12th Parachute Battalion and 12th Devonshire Battalion supported by a troop of tanks from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars. On 13 June the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division crossed the River Orne from the west, and took over responsibility for the southern sector of the Orne bridgehead. At the same time the 4th Special Service Brigade was attached to the 6th Airborne Division, which gave them the ability to rotate one brigade at a time out of the front line to allow them to rest. The 3rd Parachute Brigade, having suffered more casualties than the division's other brigades, was the first formation relieved.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} mobilization, the Life Guards arrived at their {{assigned}} position near the Belgian border. Strachwitz and his platoon volunteered for a mounted, long-distance <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrol,</b> which would penetrate far behind Belgian lines. His orders were to gather intelligence on rail and communications connections and potentially disturb them, {{as well as}} report on the war preparations being made by their opponents. If the situation allowed, he was to destroy railway and telephone connections and to derail trains, causing as much havoc as possible. His patrol ran into many obstacles and they were constantly {{on the verge of}} being detected by either British or French forces. Their objective was the Paris–Limoges–Bordeaux train track. Strachwitz dispatched a messenger, who broke through to the German lines and delivered the intelligence they had gathered. The patrol blew up the signal box at the Fontainebleau railway station, and tried to force their way through to presumed German troops at the Marne near Châlons. However, the French forces were too strong and they were unable to get through. After six weeks behind the lines their rations were depleted and they had to resort to stealing or begging. Strachwitz then decided to head for Switzerland, hoping that the French–Swiss border was not as heavily protected. After a brief skirmish with French forces, one of Strachwitz's men was seriously wounded, which forced them to seek medical attention. During many weeks of outdoor living their uniforms had deteriorated, so Strachwitz took that opportunity to buy new clothes for his men. Their progress was slowed by the wounded man, and the group was caught in civilian clothes by French forces.|$|E
5|$|Preceded by mixed Universal Carrier and {{motorcycle}} reconnaissance detachments, the 192nd and 193rd Regiments {{began moving}} to their designated areas after noon, and arrived there at nightfall. At this point, 192nd Regiment could muster only 295 men, while another 241 {{could not be}} moved by vehicle—presumably due to {{the large number of}} breakdowns and the lack of spare parts—and were ordered to proceed to Kilkis. Shortly after 17:00, about 45 German planes bombed the 192nd Regiment at the village of Theodorovo. Two officers and 15 men were killed, over 50 personnel were wounded, while two Carriers, ten Austins and ten motorcycles were destroyed, effectively destroying the 2nd Open Tank Company as a combat formation. Col. Sionidis' command, which was also in the village, suffered 13 dead and 45 wounded. Despite these losses, the 192nd Regiment reached its assigned positions, where it divided in two Resistance Centres: left, with the Tank Battalion and one of the 47mm anti-tank troops, and the right, with the Foot Battalion and a 20mm anti-tank troop. First German probing attacks during the night were successfully repelled. 193rd Regiment was more fortunate; it reached its deployment area without major obstacles, although a <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrol</b> clashed with the Germans near Kato Sourmena, and returned with a German prisoner. On the same evening, the division's 3.7cm Flak shot down a German reconnaissance plain over Krisia railway station, and reconnaissance patrols reported German infiltration along the entire line of the railway track between Mouries and Rodopoli. During the night, the division was allocated reinforcements from the 1st Security Battalion of Thessaloniki in the form of two infantry companies (one for each of the 192nd and 193rd Regiments), two MG squads and a 75mm battery. In order to reconstitute the 192nd Regiment's 2nd Open Tank Company, divisional command ordered the crews of the two Italian-equipped Closed Tank Companies to abandon their vehicles and help man the Universal Carriers. The Italian tanks were hence abandoned and took no part in the fighting, but the reorganization of the 2nd Open Tank Company was not completed until April 8. 191st Regiment was also ordered to send a squadron of its Tank Company to the Rupel Pass.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of 31 July/1 August, the 7th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) carried out a <b>reconnaissance</b> <b>patrol,</b> {{when they reached the}} Gaza to Beersheba road. Here they {{attacked}} an Ottoman cavalry patrol, capturing one prisoner.|$|E
