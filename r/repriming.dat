Contractile inactivation starts soon after membrane depolarization, and causes spontaneous relaxation from the contracture response.

We have studied this phenomenon using short (1. 5 mm) frog muscle fibers dissected from the Lumbricalis brevis muscles of the frog, with a two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. After a contracture caused by membrane depolarization to 0 mV, from a holding potential of - 100 mV, a second contracture can be developed only if the membrane is repolarized beyond a determined potential value for a certain period of time. We have used a <b>repriming</b> protocol of 1 or 2 s at - 100 mV.

With this procedure it is possible to demonstrate that the inactivation process builds up with a very slow time course, with a half time of approximately 35 s and completion in greater than 100 s.

40|$|The {{ability of}} a number of calcium {{antagonistic}} drugs including nitrendipine, D 600, and D 890 to block contractures in single skinned (sarcolemma removed) muscle fibers of the frog Rana pipiens has been characterized. Contractures were initiated by ionic substitution, which is thought to depolarize resealed transverse tubules in this preparation. Depolarization of the transverse tubules is the physiological trigger for the release of calcium ion from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and thus of contractile protein activation. Since the transverse tubular membrane potential cannot be measured in this preparation, tension development is used as a measure of activation. Once stimulated, fibers become inactivated and do not respond to a second stimulus unless allowed to recover or <b>reprime</b> (Fill and Best, 1988). Fibers exposed to calcium antagonists while fully inactivated do not recover from inactivation (became blocked or paralyzed). The extent of drug-induced block was quantified by comparing the height of individual contractures. <b>Reprimed</b> fibers were significantly less sensitive to block by both nitrendipine (10 degrees C) and D 600 (10 and 22 degrees C) than were inactivated fibers. Addition of D 600 to fibers recovering from inactivation stopped further recovery, confirming preferential interaction of the drug with the inactivated state. A concerted model that assumed coupled transitions of independent drug-binding sites from the <b>reprimed</b> to the inactivated state adequately described the data obtained from <b>reprimed</b> fibers. Photoreversal of drug action left fibers inactivated even though the drug was initially added to fibers in the <b>reprimed</b> state. This result is consistent with the prediction from the model. The estimated KI for D 600 (at 10 degrees and 22 degrees C) and for D 890 (at 10 degrees C) was approximately 10 microM. The estimated KI for nitrendipine paralysis of inactivated fibers at 10 degrees C was 16 nM. The sensitivity of <b>reprimed</b> fibers to paralysis by D 600 and D 890 was similar. However, inactivated fibers were significantly less sensitive to the membrane-impermeant derivative (D 890) than to the permeant species (D 600), which suggests a change in the drug-binding site or its environment during the inactivation process. The enantomeric dihydropyridines (+) and (-) 202 - 791, reported to be calcium channel agonists and antagonists, respectively, both caused paralysis, which suggests that blockade of a transverse tubular membrane calcium flux is not the mechanism responsible for antagonist-induced paralysis.

40|$|While large, myelinated {{dorsal root}} {{ganglion}} (DRG) neurons are capable of firing at high frequencies, small unmyelinated DRG neurons typically display much lower maximum firing frequencies. However, the molecular basis for this difference has not been delineated. Because the sodium currents in large DRG neurons exhibit rapid <b>repriming</b> (recovery from inactivation) kinetics and the sodium currents in small DRG neurons exhibit predominantly slow <b>repriming</b> kinetics, it has been proposed that differences in sodium channels might contribute to the determination of repetitive firing properties in DRG neurons. A recent study demonstrated that Nav 1. 7 expression is negatively correlated with conduction velocity and DRG cell size, while the Nav 1. 6 voltage-gated sodium channel has been implicated as the predominant isoform present at nodes of Ranvier of myelinated fibres. Therefore we characterized and compared the functional properties, including <b>repriming,</b> of recombinant Nav 1. 6 and Nav 1. 7 channels expressed in mouse DRG neurons.

40|$|In frog fast {{skeletal}} muscle, we find {{a decline}} of twitch, tetanus, and maximum K and caffeine contracture tensions as tonicity of the bathing solution is increased. The decline of tension independent of the method of producing contraction indicates that the major effect of hypertonicity is directly on contractile tension probably because of the increased internal ionic strength. However, there is some apparent disruption of excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in solutions made three times the normal tonicity (3 T solutions) since: (a) in 3 T solutions tetanic and K contracture tensions decline to zero from a value near the average maximum caffeine contracture tension at this tonicity (10 % of 1 T tetanic tension). At this time, caffeine contractures of 10 % of 1 T tetanic tension can be elicited; (b) once the K contracture tension has declined, elevated [Ca++]o, 19. 8 mM, restores K contracture tension to 13 % of 1 T tetanic tension. This probable disruption is not caused by changes in mechanical threshold since in 2 T solutions the mechanical threshold is shifted by 12 mv in the hyperpolarizing direction.

40|$|The central {{features}} of the mechanical cycle that drives the contraction of muscle are two translational steps: the working stroke, whereby an attached myosin crossbridge moves relative to the actin filament, and the <b>repriming</b> step, in which the crossbridge returns to its original orientation. Although the mechanism {{of the first of}} these is understood in some detail, that of the second has received less attention.

(1980) Annu. Rev. Physiol. 42, 293 – 309]. To discriminate between these two models we investigated the single-molecule mechanics of the myosin–actin interaction in the presence of ATP analogues such as GTP, for which the hydrolytic step itself limits the actomyosin GTPase rate to a much lower rate than for ATP. The lifetimes of bound states was proportional to 1 /[GTP], indicating that during the bound period myosin was in the actomyosin rigor configuration. Moreover, despite the very low actomyosin GTPase, the rate of actin binding and formation of the rigor state was higher than with ATP; it follows that most interactions with actin result in the release of GTP and not of the products, GDP and phosphate. There was no significant movement of the actin during this interaction, so <b>repriming</b> must occur while myosin is dissociated, as in the original Lymn–Taylor scheme [Lymn, R. W. & Taylor, E. W.

The activation curve relating peak tension to membrane potential could be shifted toward more negative or less negative potential values by hyperpolarizing or depolarizing the fiber membrane to - 130, - 120, or - 70 mV, respectively, {{which indicates that}} contractile threshold depends on the fiber membrane potential. Long (greater than 5 s) depolarizing (90 mV) pulses induce prolonged contractile responses showing a plateau and a rapid relaxation phase similar to K contractures. Conditioning hyperpolarizations prolong {{the time course of}} these responses, while conditioning depolarizations shorten it. The shortening of the response time course, which results in a decrease of the area under the response, is dependent on the amplitude and duration of the conditioning depolarization.

When the area under the response is reduced by 50 %, the level of membrane potential also affects the <b>repriming</b> rate.

Using this high time resolution system, {{it was possible to}} record individual Ca 2 + sparks at ∼ 30 -fold higher time resolution than previously attained. The resulting new experimental data provides a means of characterizing the time course of fluorescence during the brief (a few milliseconds) rising phase of a spark, which was not possible with the previously used 1. 5 – 2 ms per line confocal systems. Analysis of the time course of individual identified events indicates that fluorescence begins to rise rather abruptly {{at the start of the}} spark, continues to rise at a slightly decreasing rate to a relatively sharp peak, and then declines along a quasi-exponential time course. The mean rise time of 198 sparks was 4. 7 ± 0. 1 ms, and there was no correlation between rise time and peak amplitude. Average sparks constructed by temporally and spatially superimposing and summing groups of individual sparks having similar rise times gave a lower noise representation of the sparks, consistent with the time course of individual events. In theory, the rising phase of a spark provides a lower bound estimation of the time that Ca 2 + ions are being released by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + channel(s) generating the spark. The observed time course of fluorescence suggests that the Ca 2 + release underlying a spark could continue at a fairly constant rate throughout the rising phase of the spark, and then stop rather abruptly at the time of the peak...|$|R

Cursing fearfully, the man declared that he had “used the gun 20 years and it had never before missed fire.” Examining the lock, he <b>reprimed</b> the weapon and again aimed and pulled the trigger--without effect.Following the same procedure he tried a third time, but the result was the same. A bystander told him to “fix up his gun a little” and then “you can kill the cuss all right.” So for a fourth and final time the would-be murderer prepared, even putting in a fresh load. However, Benjamin declared, “This time the gun bursted and killed the wretch upon the spot.” One of the Missourians was heard to say, “You’d better not try to kill that man.” ...|$|R
40|$|In {{most current}} models of muscle {{contraction}} {{there are two}} translational steps, the working stroke, whereby an attached myosin cross-bridge moves relative to the actin filament, and the <b>repriming</b> step, in which the cross-bridge returns to its original orientation. The development of single molecule methods has allowed a more detailed investigation {{of the relationship of}} these mechanical steps to the underlying biochemistry. In the normal adenosine triphosphate cycle, myosin. adenosine diphosphate. phosphate (M. ADP. Pi) binds to actin and moves it by ca. 5 nm on average before the formation of the end product, the rigor actomyosin state. All the other product-like intermediate states tested were found to give no net movement indicating that M. ADP. Pi alone binds in a pre-force state. Myosin states with bound, unhydrolysed nucleoside triphosphates also give no net movement, indicating that these must also bind in a post-force conformation and that the <b>repriming,</b> post- to pre-transition during the forward cycle must take place while the myosin is dissociated from actin. These observations fit in well with the structural model in which the working stroke is aligned to the opening of the switch 2 element of the ATPase site...|$|E
40|$|Short {{muscle fibers}} (approximately 1. 5 mm) of Rana pipiens were voltage- clamped with a two-microelectrode {{technique}} at a holding potential of - 100 mV. Using conditioning depolarizing ramps, with slopes greater than 0. 2 mV/s, partially inactivated responses are obtained at threshold values between - 55 and - 35 mV. With slopes {{equal to or}} slower than 0. 1 mV/s, one inactivates contraction without ever activating it. When the membrane potential is brought slowly to values more positive than about - 40 mV, test pulses, applied {{on top of the}} ramps, bringing the membrane potential to values up to + 100 mV, are ineffective in eliciting contractile responses, which indicates complete inactivation. After inactivation, contractile threshold is shifted by perhaps 10 mV, to about - 40 mV. The sensitivity of fibers to depolarizing ramps is increased by D- 600 (50 microM), dantrolene (50 microM), tetracaine (100 microM), and low calcium (10 (- 8) M). In the presence of these agents, complete inactivation was obtained using ramp slopes of 1, 0. 8, 0. 4, and 0. 2 mV/s, respectively. Nifedipine was less effective. With D- 600, once inactivation had been induced, no <b>repriming</b> occurred after repolarization to - 100 mV, and partial recovery occurred after washing out the drug. With low calcium, tetracaine, and nifedipine, the tension- voltage relationship was not affected, whereas the steady state inactivation curve (obtained in <b>repriming</b> experiments) was shifted by 10 - 25 mV toward more negative potentials. With D- 600, the activation curve was not modified, whereas the inactivation curve could not be obtained, because of <b>repriming</b> failure. With dantrolene, the inactivation curve was not affected, whereas the activation curve was shifted toward less negative potentials and peak tension diminished, depending on the pulse duration. The results indicate {{that it is possible to}} induce complete inactivation without activation, and to differentiate activation and inactivation parameters pharmacologically, which suggests that the two are separate processes...|$|E
40|$|At present {{little is}} known about how the low-affinity {{cholecystokinin}} receptor inhibits secretagogue-stimulated amylase secretion from pancreatic acinar cells. To examine this question we have determined how cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK 8) influences Ca 2 +-dependent amylase secretion from alpha-toxin-permeabilized pancreatic acini. CCK 8 significantly inhibited Ca 2 +-stimulated amylase secretion. The inhibitory actions of CCK 8 were completely blocked by the addition of JMV- 180, a specific antagonist for the low-affinity CCK 8 receptor. Previous studies have shown that Ca 2 +-dependent amylase secretion from alpha-toxin-permeabilized acini has two distinct phases [Padfield and Panesar (1997) Am. J. Physiol. 36, G 655 - 660]. There is an initial rapid phase of secretion which represents release from exocytotic sites primed by MgATP prior to permeabilization. This is followed by a slower sustained phase of secretion which, in part, reflects the MgATP-dependent <b>repriming</b> of the exocytotic machinery. CCK 8 did not influence the initial rapid phase of the Ca 2 +-dependent secretory response, but inhibited the second slower sustained phase. Moreover, CCK 8 was shown to inhibit the MgATP-dependent priming of exocytosis in the acini. These results indicate that the low-affinity CCK receptor blocks stimulated amylase secretion by inhibiting the MgATP-dependent <b>repriming</b> of exocytosis...|$|E
40|$|The SHARE II (Space Station Heat Pipe Advanced Radiator Elements) flight {{experiment}} was flow in August 1991 on STS- 43 {{in support of}} the Space Station Freedom (SSF) program. The flight {{experiment was}} designed to demonstrate startup and sustained microgravity operation of two 22 ft. long high capacity prototype SSF heat pipe radiator designs. The monogroove heat pipe radiator, one of the two heat pipe radiator designs flown on this experiment, {{is the subject of this}} paper. During the flight, the monogroove heat pipe, which contained 40 to 50 ppm of noncondensible gas to simulate end-of-life conditions, was shown to start up, vent bubbles as necessary, <b>reprime</b> under load, and operate successfully under all test conditions. The monogroove heat pipe operated under load for a total of 75 hours and achieved sustained heat transport of 50, 000 watt-inches. This paper briefly describes the results of the previous SHARE flight experiment and the improvements made to the monogroove heat pipe as a result of that experiment. The test results of the SHARE II flight are discussed in detail. Based on the results of the SHARE II experiment, the monogroove heat pipe is ready for use in its intended application on SSF...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{has been}} developed to examine {{the behavior of a}} titanium-water loop heat pipe (LHP) under standard and elevated acceleration fields. The LHP was mounted on a 2. 44 m diameter centrifuge table on edge with heat applied to the evaporator via a mica heater and heat rejected using a high-temperature polyalphaolefin oil (PAO) coolant loop. The LHP was tested under the following parametric ranges: heat load at the evaporator, 100 ≤ Qin ≤ 600 W; heat load at the compensation chamber, 0 ≤ Qcc ≤ 50 W; radial acceleration, 0 ≤ ar ≤ 10 g. For stationary operation, the evaporative heat transfer coefficient decreased monotonically with heat load while the thermal resistance decreased to a minimum then increased. Heat input to the compensation chamber was found to increase the evaporative heat transfer coefficient and decrease the thermal resistance for Qin = 500 W. Transient periodic flow reversal in the LHP was found for some cases, which was likely due to vapor bubble formation in the primary wick. Operation in an elevated acceleration environment revealed that dry-out was dependent on both Qin and ar, and the ability for the LHP to <b>reprime</b> after an acceleration event that induced dry-out was influenced by the evaporator temperature. The evaporative heat transfer coefficient and thermal resistance were found not to be significantly dependent on radial acceleration. However, the evaporator wall superheat was found to increase slightly with radial acceleration at high heat loads...|$|R
