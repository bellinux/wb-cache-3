25|$|In 1811 John Edwards junior had a son, Nash Vaughan Edwards, {{named after}} both his cousin {{and a fellow}} lawyer who became the family's benefactor. The work on Rheola House itself did not begin until 1812, and was {{completed}} in 1814. The result was a 'rustic' villa-style building, which <b>retained</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> its cottage origins. Following principles of the picturesque, the house is asymmetric, and sits modestly within its wooded landscape. The building has two main facades, each with a full-height bay to one side, and a veranda along one front. The grounds too were given picturesque features. A stables, laundry and an icehouse were built closer to the lake.|$|E
25|$|Other public festivals {{were not}} {{required}} by the calendar, but occasioned by events. The triumph of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of religious vows, though these tended to be overshadowed by {{the political and social}} significance of the event. During the late Republic, the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display, and the ludi attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests. Under the Principate, all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control: the most lavish were subsidised by emperors, and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office. Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries. Others, such as the traditional Republican Secular Games to mark a new era (saeculum), became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity. That the spectacles <b>retained</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> their sacral aura even in late antiquity is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part.|$|E

Despite war tramping and Western labors Glenn <b>retained</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> his old grace and lightness. But just to dance with him was enough to swell her heart, and for once she grew oblivious to the spectators.|$|E
6000|$|Near {{the right}} hand of John Perkins stood a chair. On {{the back of it}} stood Katy's blue shirtwaist. It still <b>retained</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> her contour. Midway of the sleeves were fine, {{individual}} wrinkles made by the movements of her arms in working for his comfort and pleasure. A delicate but impelling odor of bluebells came from it. John took it and looked long and soberly at the unresponsive grenadine. Katy had never been unresponsive. Tears:--yes, tears--came into John Perkins's eyes. When she came back things would be different. He would make up for all his neglect. What was life without her? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'M. Darpent?' I asked; and I {{was told}} that I was right, and that the young {{advocate}} had been writing a discourse upon Cicero which he was to read aloud to the fair critics and their friends. Madame de Montausier added {{that his father was}} a counselor in the Parliament, who had originally been a Huguenot, but had converted himself with all his family, and had since held several good appointments. She thought the young man, Clement Darpent, likely to become a man of mark, and she did not like him the less for having <b>retained</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> the Huguenot gravity.|$|E
50|$|The settlement's present {{appearance}} {{dates from}} the early nineteenth century. Thomas Bateman rebuilt the entire village in the 1820s, incorporating the mullioned windows of earlier buildings to <b>retain</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> its traditional appearance. The small parish church also dates from this period, and Bateman rebuilt Middleton Hall as his own residence.|$|R

50|$|From its {{earliest}} days, Bellenden was populated disproportionately by French Huguenots, and still <b>retains</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> its French flavour, with various streets, pubs and businesses carrying French {{names such as}} the Montpelier Public House, Petit Chou cafe and Choumert Road attracting a significant French population to the area. For this reason Bellenden has for some years been known as 'the French Quarter'.|$|R
60|$|She had {{remained}} small and was quaintly stooped in {{neck and shoulders}} but <b>retained</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> her childish charm. To her I was quite alien, in no sense a brother. She was very reticent, {{but it did not}} take me long to discover that in her quiet fashion she commanded the camp. For all his military bluster, the old soldier was entirely subject to her. She was never wilful concerning anything really important, but she assumed all the rights of an individual and being the only child left in the family, went about her affairs without remark or question, serene, sweet but determined.|$|E
6000|$|Peggotty had {{considered}} herself highly privileged in {{being allowed to}} participate in these labours; and, although she still <b>retained</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> her old sentiment of awe in reference to my aunt, had received so many marks of encouragement and confidence, {{that they were the}} best friends possible. But the time had now come (I am speaking of the Saturday when I was to take tea at Miss Mills's) when it was necessary for her to return home, and enter on the discharge of the duties she had undertaken in behalf of Ham. 'So good-bye, Barkis,' said my aunt, 'and take care of yourself! I am sure I never thought I could be sorry to lose you!' ...|$|E
60|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the month}} the Plague spread rapidly, and all work ceased in the parishes most affected. But, just as it had raged for weeks in the Western parishes outside the City, so it seemed {{restricted}} by certain invisible lines, after it had made its entry within the walls, and while it raged in some parts others were entirely unaffected, and here shops were open, and the streets still <b>retained</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> their usual appearance. There had been great want among the poorer classes, owing to the cessation of work, especially along the riverside. The Lord Mayor, some of the Aldermen, and most other rich citizens had hastened to leave the City. While many of the clergy were deserting their flocks, and many doctors their patients, others remained firmly at their posts, and worked incessantly, and did all that was possible in order to check the spread of the Plague and to relieve the distress of the poor.|$|E
50|$|During the 1980s and 1990s {{the area}} {{experienced}} a considerable change in its socioeconomic landscape as many affluent Wellingtonians {{became aware of}} its natural beauty, resulting in many small coastal batches and cottages being replaced with larger family homes and infill housing. Many retired residents still remain in their older batches and cottages, allowing the area to <b>retain</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> its character.|$|R
50|$|To some extent, Thringstone {{has become}} an {{extension}} of Coalville (within living memory, it was relatively isolated) although, thanks to contiguity with Gracedieu Wood and the preservation of other greenbelt areas, it manages to <b>retain</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> an individual identity {{and has not been}} absorbed into the urban sprawl of Coalville to the same degree as parts of Whitwick, Snibston and Hugglescote.|$|R
50|$|Set {{within the}} London green belt, the towns still <b>retain</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> their own identities. Welwyn Garden City has a famous {{heritage}} {{being one of}} only two Garden Cities in the country, and is uniquely both Garden City and designated New Town. They function to some extent as dormitory towns for householders who work in London. The Welwyn Viaduct is a locally important landmark.|$|R
60|$|Ronda was {{the most}} virulent nest of Moorish depredators in the whole border country. It was {{situated}} {{in the midst of}} the wild Serrania, or chain of mountains of the same name, which are uncommonly lofty, broken, and precipitous. It stood on an almost isolated rock, nearly encircled by a deep valley, or rather chasm, through which ran the beautiful river called Rio Verde. The Moors of this city were the most active, robust, and warlike of all the mountaineers, and their very children discharged the crossbow with unerring aim. They were incessantly harassing the rich plains of Andalusia; their city abounded with Christian captives, who might sigh in vain for deliverance from this impregnable fortress. Such was Ronda in the time of the Moors, and it has ever <b>retained</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> the same character, even to the present day. Its inhabitants continue to be among the boldest, fiercest, and most adventurous of the Andalusian mountaineers, and the Serrania de Ronda is famous as the most dangerous resort of the bandit and the contrabandista.|$|E
60|$|The next {{incident}} which I have {{to relate}} as bearing at all upon {{the question of}} Miss Northcott is an unpleasant one. Yet I must detail it as accurately as possible, since it may throw some light upon the sequel. One cold night, several months after the conversation with my second cousin which I have quoted above, I was walking {{down one of the}} lowest streets in the city on my way back from a case which I had been attending. It was very late, and I was picking my way among the dirty loungers who were clustering round the doors of a great gin-palace, when a man staggered out from among them, and held out his hand to me with a drunken leer. The gaslight fell full upon his face, and, to my intense astonishment, I recognised in the degraded creature before me my former acquaintance, young Archibald Reeves, who had once been famous {{as one of the most}} dressy and particular men in the whole college. I was so utterly surprised that for a moment I almost doubted the evidence of my own senses; but there was no mistaking those features, which, though bloated with drink, still <b>retained</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> their former comeliness. I was determined to rescue him, for one night at least, from the company into which he had fallen.|$|E
60|$|It was in {{one corner}} of an old palace on the Grand Canal, and the window of the little parlor looked down upon the water, which had made friends with its painted ceiling, and {{bestowed}} tremulous, golden smiles upon it when the sun shone. The dining-room was not so much favored by the water, but it gave upon some green and ever-rustling tree-tops, that rose to it from a tiny garden-ground, no bigger than a pocket handkerchief. Through this window, also, we could see the quaint, picturesque life of the canal; and from another room we could reach a little terrace above the water. We were not in the appartamento signorile, [Footnote: The noble floor --as the second or third story of the palace is called.]--that was above, --but we were more snugly quartered on the first story from the ground- floor, commonly used as a winter apartment in the old times. But it had been cut up, and suites of rooms had been broken according to the caprice of successive landlords, till it was not at all palatial any more. The upper stories still <b>retained</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> former grandeur, and had acquired with time more than former discomfort. We were not envious of them, for they were humbly let at a price less than we paid; though we could not quite repress a covetous yearning for their arched and carven windows, which we saw sometimes from the canal, above the tops of the garden trees.|$|E
50|$|The current Sholing Council Ward {{population}} of over 159,500 {{falls into the}} Southampton Itchen. The local MP is currently Gear (politician). The area is now {{an integral part of}} the City of Southampton, with little physical trace of its rural beginnings, however it still manages to <b>retain</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> its former rustic nature with its many open areas, albeit smaller than before, and its large gypsy population.|$|R

50|$|In 1921, the Philadelphia Skating Club and Humane Society {{was one of}} {{the seven}} {{original}} clubs which formed the United States Figure Skating Association. It {{is one of the few}} clubs in the United States that owns its own rink, located in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, and which opened in 1938.

6000|$|The Yankee has <b>retained</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> {{the long}} {{sound of the}} a in such words as axe, wax, pronouncing them exe, wex (shortened from aix, waix). He also says hev and hed (h[=a]ve, h[=a]d for have and had). In most cases he follows an Anglo-Saxon usage. In aix for axle he {{certainly}} does. I find wex and aisches (ashes) in Pecock, and exe in the Paston Letters. Golding rhymes wax with wexe and spells challenge chelenge. Chaucer wrote hendy. Dryden rhymes can with men, as Mr. Biglow would. Alexander Gill, Milton's teacher, in his 'Logonomia' cites hez for hath as peculiar to Lincolnshire. I find hayth in Collier's 'Bibliographical Account of Early English Literature' under the date 1584, and Lord Cromwell so wrote it. Sir Christopher Wren wrote belcony. Our fect is only the O.F. faict. Thaim for them was common in the sixteenth century. We have {{an example of the}} same thing in the double form of the verb thrash, thresh. While the New Englander cannot be brought to say instead for instid (commonly 'stid where not the last word in a sentence), he changes the i into e in red for rid, tell for till, hender for hinder, rense for rinse. I find red in the old interlude of 'Thersytes,' tell in a letter of Daborne to Henslowe, and also, I shudder to mention it, in a letter of the great Duchess of Marlborough, Atossa herself! It occurs twice in a single verse of the Chester Plays, ...|$|E
6000|$|Peter was graciously {{received}} {{and the conversation}} dealt, for a few moments, with the usual banalities of the voyage. Then followed the business of settling the Duchesse in her place. When she was really installed, and surrounded with all the paraphernalia of a great and fanciful lady, including a handful of long cigarettes, she raised {{for the first time}} her veil. Peter, who was at the moment engaged in conversation with her, was a little shocked by the result. Her features were worn, her face dead-white, with many signs of the ravages wrought by the constant use of cosmetics. Only her eyes had <b>retained</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> their former splendor. These latter were almost violet in color, deep-set, with dark rims, and were sufficient almost in themselves to make one forget for a moment the less prepossessing details of her appearance. A small library of books was by her side, but after a while she no longer pretended any interest in them. She was a born conversationalist, a creature of her country entirely and absolutely feminine, to whom the subtle and flattering deference of the other sex was the breath of life itself. Peter burned his homage upon her altar with a craft which amounted to genius. In less than half an hour, Madame la Duchesse was looking many years younger. The vague look of apprehension had passed from her face. Their voices had sunk to a confidential undertone, punctuated often by the music of her laughter. Sogrange, with a murmured word of apology, had slipped away long ago. Decidedly, for an Englishman, Peter was something of a marvel! ...|$|E
60|$|But for Austria, {{and even}} more for Russia, there was this to be said; that the French Republican ideal was incomplete, and that they possessed, in a corrupt but still {{positive}} and often popular sense, what was needed to complete it. The Czar was not democratic, but he was humanitarian. He was a Christian Pacifist; there is something of the Tolstoyan in every Russian. It is not wholly fanciful {{to talk of the}} White Czar: for Russia even destruction has a deathly softness as of snow. Her ideas are often innocent and even childish; like the idea of Peace. The phrase Holy Alliance was a beautiful truth for the Czar, though only a blasphemous jest for his rascally allies, Metternich and Castlereagh. Austria, though she had lately fallen to a somewhat treasonable toying with heathens and heretics of Turkey and Prussia, still <b>retained</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> the old Catholic comfort for the soul. Priests still bore witness to that mighty mediaeval institution which even its enemies concede to be a noble nightmare. All their hoary political iniquities had not deprived them of that dignity. If they darkened the sun in heaven, they clothed it with the strong colours of sunrise in garment or gloriole; if they had given men stones for bread, the stones were carved with kindly faces and fascinating tales. If justice counted on their shameful gibbets hundreds of the innocent dead, they could still say that for them death was more hopeful than life for the heathen. If the new daylight discovered their vile tortures, there had lingered in the darkness some dim memory that they were tortures of Purgatory and not, like those which Parisian and Prussian diabolists showed shameless in the sunshine, of naked hell. They claimed a truth not yet disentangled from human nature; for indeed earth is not even earth without heaven, as a landscape is not a landscape without the sky. And in, a universe without God there is not room enough for a man.|$|E
5000|$|Spike often nicknames people, both as insults and as {{terms of}} endearment; for example, he calls Dawn [...] "Little Bit" [...] or [...] "the Niblet". Spike also <b>retains</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> his {{literary}} intellect from his human side, routinely referencing poetry, songs, and literature; on occasion he even waxes poetic {{on the nature}} of love, life, and unlife as being driven by blood, reasoning that blood is more powerful than any supernatural force because it is what separates the living from the dead.|$|R
60|$|On {{the borders}} of Lancashire and Westmoreland, two centuries since, stood Lynnwood, a picturesque mansion, still <b>retaining</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> the {{character}} of a fortified house. It was ever a matter of regret to its owner, Sir Marmaduke Carstairs, that his grandfather had so modified its construction, by levelling one side of the quadrangle, and inserting large mullion windows in that portion inhabited by the family, that it was in no condition to stand a siege, in the time of the Civil War.|$|R
25|$|The {{immediate}} commercial {{failure of}} the novel has been suggested as pivotal in Herbert's later career – {{it was clear to}} him that novel-writing was not likely to prove financially rewarding, which helped focus his efforts on light journalism and set the tone for most of his later writings. He would not write anything quite the same again – The House by the River (1920), a crime novel, <b>retains</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> the simple style, but begins to introduce elements of humour not found in The Secret Battle.|$|R
60|$|The {{house was}} quiet, the {{children}} having gone to bed, and he groped {{his way through}} the dark parlour to his den, turning on the electric switch, sinking into an armchair, and lighting a cigar. He liked this room of his, which still <b>retained</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> that flavour of a refuge and sanctuary it had so eminently possessed in the now forgotten days of matrimonial conflict. One of the few elements of agreement he had held in common with the late Mrs. Ditmar was a similarity of taste in household decoration, and they had gone together to a great emporium in Boston to choose the furniture and fittings. The lamp in the centre of the table was a bronze column supporting a hemisphere of heavy red and emerald glass, the colours woven into an intricate and bizarre design, after the manner of the art nouveau--so the zealous salesman had informed them. Cora Ditmar, when exhibiting this lamp to admiring visitors, had remembered the phrase, though her pronunciation of it, according to the standard of the Sorbonne, left something to be desired. The table and chairs, of heavy, shiny oak marvellously and precisely carved by machines, matched the big panels of the wainscot. The windows were high in the wall, thus preventing any intrusion from the clothes-yard on which they looked. The bookcases, protected by leaded panes, held countless volumes of the fiction from which Cora Ditmar had derived her knowledge of the great world outside of Hampton, together with certain sets she had bought, not only as ornaments, but with a praiseworthy view to future culture,--such as Whitmarsh's Library of the Best Literature. These volumes, alas, were still uncut; but some of the pages of the novels--if one cared to open them--were stained with chocolate. The steam radiator was a decoration in itself, the fireplace set in the red and yellow tiles that made the hearth. Above the oak mantel, in a gold frame, was a large coloured print of a Magdalen, doubled up in grief, with a glory of loose, Titian hair, chosen by Ditmar himself as expressing the nearest possible artistic representation of his ideal of the female form. Cora Ditmar's objections on the score of voluptuousness and of insufficient clothing had been vain. She had recognized no immorality of sentimentality in the art itself; what she felt, and with some justice, was that this particular Magdalen was unrepentant, and that Ditmar knew it. And the picture remained an offence to her as long as she lived. Formerly he had enjoyed the contemplation of this figure, reminding him, as it did, of mellowed moments in conquests of the past; suggesting also possibilities of the future. For he had been quick to discount the attitude of bowed despair, the sop flung by a sensuous artist to Christian orthodoxy. He had been sceptical about despair--feminine despair, which could always be cured by gifts and baubles. But to-night, as he raised his eyes, he felt a queer sensation marring the ecstatic perfection of his mood. That quality in the picture which so long had satisfied and entranced him had now become repellent, an ugly significant reflection of something--something in himself he was suddenly eager to repudiate and deny. It was with a certain amazement that he found himself on his feet with the picture in his hand, gazing at the empty space where it had hung. For he had had no apparent intention of obeying that impulse. What should he do with it? Light the fire and burn it--frame and all? The frame {{was an integral part of}} it. What would his housekeeper say? But now that he had actually removed it from the wall he could not replace it, so he opened the closet door and thrust it into a corner among relics which had found refuge there. He had put his past in the closet; yet the relief he felt was mingled with the peculiar qualm that follows the discovery of symptoms never before remarked. Why should this woman have this extraordinary effect of making him dissatisfied with himself? He sat down again and tried to review the affair from that first day when he had surprised in her eyes the flame dwelling in her. She had completely upset his life, increasingly distracted his mind until now he could imagine no peace unless he possessed her. Hitherto he had recognized in his feeling for her nothing but that same desire he had had for other women, intensified to a degree never before experienced. But this sudden access of morality--he did not actually define it as such--was disquieting. And in the feverish, semi-objective survey he was now making of his emotional tract he was discovering the presence of other disturbing symptoms such as an unwonted tenderness, a consideration almost amounting to pity which at times he had vaguely sensed yet never sought imaginatively to grasp. It bewildered him by hampering a ruthlessness hitherto absolute. The fierceness of her inflamed his passion, yet he recognized dimly behind this fierceness an instinct of self-protection--and he thought of her in this moment as a struggling bird that fluttered out of his hands when they were ready to close over her. So it had been to-night. He might have kept her, prevented her from taking the car. Yet he had let her go! There came again, utterly to blot this out, the memory of her lips.|$|E

There are attractive interiors, particularly the stair with twisted balusters and timber arcading. Many fittings were moved here in the 1880s by Dorothea Veitch from Bassendean House.|$|R
