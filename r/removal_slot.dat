Směrnice přímek a koeficienty korelace u graficky prezentovaných výsledků poskytují informace o charakteru závislosti hloubky drážky na nastaveném výkonu za daného posuvu. The {{results of}} CO 2 laser micro-machining {{research}} {{are presented in}} this paper. There was researched laser beam and its using on different types of polymeric materials in details. From experiment it is evident the slot depth grows linear with increasing values of power at concrete adjusted value of feed. Biggest depth is at low values of feed. This phenomenon was observed at all materials. Gradient of lines and correlation coefficients offer information about dependence character of slot depth on adjusted power and feed at graphic presenting results. Value of gradient (k) is used for exact control of stock <b>removal</b> (<b>slot</b> depth). Gradient of line gives information about sloth depth at increasing of power about definite number of percents. Correlation coefficient gives approximate quality of linear dependence (compare with R 2 = 1). Resulting structures can be very exact and with high quality of surface in dependence on laser parameters and on type of machining material...|$|E
40|$|Liquid {{film cooling}} is an {{important}} method for cooling {{the walls of a}} liquid rocket engine. Mass transfer via entrainment decreases the effectiveness of the film coolant and it is therefore important to estimate the amount of film coolant that establishes itself along the wall of a combustion chamber if the coolant flow rate is to be optimized. However, film entrainment research is limited in regards to film cooling applications in rockets. The correlations and theories that have been published are often limited in scope and have only been tested at momentum fluxes that are an order of magnitude less than those typically experienced in rockets. Experimental research has been conducted in a cold-flow test article at AFRL in order to investigate the effects of the gas stream momentum flux on the coolant flow rate that remains attached to the wall. Specifically, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the establishment of a shear driven liquid film introduced into a rectangular test section by a. 38 mm X 25. 4 mm slot, perpendicular to the stream-wise direction of the gas phase. A secondary objective of this thesis was to investigate the ability of several diagnostics to measure the interfacial shear stress, mean film thickness, and the film mass flow rate of a liquid water film shear-driven by nitrogen gas in cold flow conditions. Ultimately, a film <b>removal</b> <b>slot</b> was chosen to measure the film mass flow rate, differential pressure taps were chosen to indirectly deduce the interfacial shear stress by measuring a stream-wise pressure drop, and a laser focus displacement meter was chosen to measure the liquid film thickness. Lastly, a high-speed video camera was used to obtain qualitative visual data of the surface of the shear-driven liquid film. ^ Experiments were conducted during June and November 2011 in order to accomplish the objectives of the thesis. The experimental apparatus consisted of a rectangular channel through which nitrogen gas flowed at momentum fluxes ranging from 2. 5 to 110 kPa. A liquid water film was introduced into the test section at flow rates ranging from. 0034 kg/s to. 018 kg/s through a. 38 X 25. 4 mm slot that was perpendicular to the gas flow. In the experiments described herein, the film <b>removal</b> <b>slot</b> failed to completely remove the entire film, and, therefore, the results from the film <b>removal</b> <b>slot</b> were inaccurate. However, from the data that was obtained, it appears as though the liquid that becomes entrained into the gas phase increases with both increasing gas phase momentum flux and injected liquid flow rate. The amount of liquid entrained appears to vary from about 20 to 60 % of the injected liquid flow rate for the conditions studied. In addition, the correlations for entrainment proposed by several other authors did not agree well with the data that was obtained nor each other. The pressure drop data that was obtained was inaccurate due to problems with the flow, an electrical error, or leaks in pressure lines. Due to difficulties encountered with the differential pressure transducers, it is not recommended that the interfacial shear stress be estimated from pressure drop data. The thickness of the liquid film was shown to decrease with increasing gas phase momentum flux and increase with increasing liquid film flow rate. The film thicknesses measured ranged from 4 µm at the highest momentum fluxes and lowest liquid flow rates to 160 µm at the lowest gas phase momentum fluxes and highest liquid flow rates, with a 25 % relative uncertainty. The film thickness that were measured were of the same order of magnitude as estimated or measured for similar conditions by other researchers. A numerical model was used to determine an upper bound on the film thickness results, and the experimental results fell below and exhibited the same trends as the upper bound. It was also discovered that the turbulent surface of the liquid film and entrained liquid droplets at high momentum fluxes adversely affected the ability of the LFD to directly detect the surface of the liquid film. A new method for using the LFD to measure film thicknesses based on geometric optics is proposed. However, the results obtained by this new method still require further validation. ...|$|E

40|$|To {{examine whether}} the ban and {{complete}} <b>removal</b> of <b>slot</b> machines in Norway in 2007 {{may have led}} to: a) changes in gambling behaviour and changes in prevalence of problem gambling among adolescents, and b) changes in gambling behaviour among adolescent problem gamblers. Two school surveys were conducted, one before (in 2006) and one after the intervention (in 2008), comprising students aged 13 to 18 years (net samples = 4, 912 in 2006 and 3, 855 in 2008). Identical measures of gambling behaviour and problem gambling were obtained in both surveys. After the intervention, a small proportion {{reported that they had}} changed their gambling behaviour, mainly in terms of having stopped gambling. Comparisons of self-reports of gambling behaviour showed that slot machine gambling had decreased significantly, while gambling on other games had increased, yet frequent gambling on any game had decreased after the intervention. However, the change in prevalence of at-risk and problem gambling differed across instruments. The prevalence of self-perceived gambling problems had decreased whereas the prevalence of at-risk and problem gambling as assessed by SOGS-RA had increased. Among at-risk and problem gamblers frequent gambling and perceived gambling problems were reported less frequently in 2008 compared to 2006. The ban and <b>removal</b> of <b>slot</b> machines in Norway was succeeded by a decrease in frequent gambling among adolescents in general as well as among at-risk and problem gambler...|$|R
40|$|Water-base {{pressure}} sensitive adhesives dominate the market of adhesives applied to paper. These materials are formulated as emulsions {{of acrylic polymers}} in water. Surfactants are used to stabilize the hydrophobic polymer particles. When water-based adhesives are dried, particles coalesce and surfactant segregates to interparticle domains that provide pathways for water to enter the adhesive film. Atomic force microscopy, under humidity controlled conditions, {{has been used to}} characterize formation of these structures in adhesive films. Surfactant rich domains, which strongly interact with water, lead to dramatic differences between the wet and dry mechanical properties of adhesive films. The efficiency of adhesive <b>removal</b> by <b>slotted</b> screening was observed to correlate with wet tensile strength for a set of model adhesives. In contrast, dry tensile strength is not useful for predicting performance during recycling operations...|$|R

She forced the <b>removal</b> of <b>slot</b> machines from American Legion, Eagles, and Shrine facilities and even the prestigious Multnomah Athletic Club. She reorganized the police department, ferreting out corruption and enforced city ordinances against vice. Her administration instituted one-way traffic patterns in the downtown and revitalized the Housing Authority of Portland. She also promoted an ordinance that passed unanimously prohibiting anyone from being excluded in a public place in Portland. She survived a recall effort in October 1949 and derision in the press (she was called [...] "No Sin Lee" [...] after closing the Chinese gambling establishments), but her anti-gambling stance likely cost her a second mayoral term, since influential citizens of the city believed it would destroy the private clubs.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} study to provide causal {{evidence}} {{on the impact of}} slot machines on individual consumer bankruptcy filings, using recent econometric techniques designed to identify causality. We exploit very detailed administrative data from Alberta, Canada, on the location of the universe of slot machine locations, and administrative data on the location of universe of individual bankruptcy filers. Specifically, we compare the impacts on neighborhood bankruptcies of a bar or restaurant with a large amount of gambling removing its slot machines, compared to a bar or restaurant {{with a small amount of}} gambling removing its slot machines. We exploit our ability to observe the total dollar magnitude of gambling at every bar and restaurant. In order to control for unobservable neighborhood characteristics, we use the spatial difference in difference econometric methodology. This methodology differences out unobservable neighborhood characteristics by comparing bankruptcy filers that are fractions of a kilometer (radii of 0, 25 km, 0. 5 km and 0. 75 km) from the specific bar or restaurant, compared to bankruptcy filers slightly further away (radii of 1. 5 km, 2. 0 km and 2. 5 km). We find that a 1 % increase in total dollars gambled in the year prior to the <b>removal</b> of <b>slots</b> from the specific bar or restaurant, causes a 1 % to 3 % reduction in bankruptcy filers two years after the closure of that slot machine location. These effects are much larger for very close neighbors of the slots location (0. 25 km) compared to neighbors slightly further away (0. 5 km and 0. 75 km) ...|$|R
40|$|Low-speed wind-tunnel {{tests have}} been made to {{determine}} the external and internal characteristics of leading-edge air intakes in swept wings, under flight conditions. Tests on a delta model show that leading-edge intakes in the wing root give an advantage in effective sweepback and critical Mach number (estimated from the low-speed pressure distribution) compared with nacelle-type intakes adjacent to the body. The internal loss in level flight for a 52 ° sweptback entry is 4 ~/o ram worse than when the entry is square to the direction of flight. The explanation of this loss is found {{in the nature of the}} pre-entry retardation for level-flight velocity ratios. A boundary-layer bypass leading from a slot inside the intake removes most of the additional loss. Tests on a swept-wing model with a simplified intake give the effects of duct diffusion, of boundary layer from an adjacent body, and of boundary-layer <b>removal</b> through a <b>slot</b> or porous wall. A general formula for intake loss is applied to show the dependence of the loss on entry shape and on the value of the design velocity ratio. Sectio...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this research program was to investigate methods to modify the leading edge separation region, {{which could lead to}} an improvement in aeroelastic stability of advanced airfoil designs. The airfoil section used is representative of current low aspect ratio fan blade tip sections. The experimental potion of this study investigated separated zone boundary layer from <b>removal</b> through suction <b>slots.</b> Suction applied to a cavity {{in the vicinity of the}} separation onset point was found to be the most effective location. The computational study looked into the influence of front camber on flutter stability. To assess the influence of the change in airfoil shape on stability the work-per-cycle was evaluated for torsion mode oscillations. It was shown that the front camberline shape can be an important factor for stabilizing the predicted work-per-cycle and reducing the predicted extent of the separation zone. In addition, data analysis procedures are discussed for reducing data acquired in experiments that involve periodic unsteady data. This work was conducted in support of experiments being conducted in the NASA Glenn Research Center Transonic Flutter Cascade. The spectral block averaging method is presented. This method is shown to be able to account for variations in airfoil oscillation frequency that can occur in experiments that force oscillate the airfoils to simulate flutter...|$|R
