In this context, {{the aim was to}} evaluate the agronomic characteristics and to deter-mine the influence of the order of <b>racemes</b> and nutrient sources on yield of castor bean. Thus, under field con-ditions, in the municipality of Remigio, Paraíba State, an experiment with BRS Nordestina cultivar was carried out in randomized blocks design arranged in 5 (different sources of organic manure: without organic manure, compost, compost enriched with rock powders and manure and mineral complete) x 4 (orders of <b>racemes</b> pri-mary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary) factorial experiment, with four replications. During the experiment, plant height and insertion of <b>racemes</b> were evaluated, length and number of <b>racemes,</b> early blooming and matu-ration of <b>racemes.</b> After harvesting, the following variables were determined: mass of <b>racemes,</b> number of grains per plant, yield, weight of hundred grains, length and width of the grains and the contribution of differ-ent orders of <b>racemes</b> in total yield. The growth of castor bean increased with the fertilizing, especially for or-ganic compounds. The first inflorescences were emitted in castor bean plants fertilized organically. The mass of <b>racemes,</b> the number of grains per plant and productivity were higher in <b>racemes</b> of secondary and tertiary orders.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{increasing}} atmospheric carbon dioxide （CO_ 2 ） concentration resulted in the enhancement of vegetative growth {{and an increase in}} seed yield in soybean （Glycine max （L. ） Merrill）. However, the way this increase in seed yield comes about is not well known. The objective {{of this study was to}} make clear the effects of CO_ 2 enrichment on flowering and podding, since these are the factors which directly limit the seed yield in soybean. Cultivar 2 ̆ 7 Fukuyutaka 2 ̆ 7 were grown in the ambient CO_ 2 concentration （AC: 350 μmol CO_ 2 mol^ Air） and an enriched CO_ 2 concentration （EC: 700 μmol CO_ 2 mol^ Air） throughout the growth period. The effects of EC on the flowering were significantly different among the individual <b>racemes.</b> On the terminal <b>racemes</b> and the primary <b>racemes,</b> there was no difference in the total number of flowers between AC and EC, although the number of flowers at the peak of flowering differed slightly with the CO_ 2 regime used. On the secondary <b>racemes</b> with compound leaves, EC condition increased the number of flowers compared with AC. The opposite effect was seen on the secondary <b>racemes</b> without compound leaves. Furthermore, large number of flowers on the tertiary <b>racemes</b> appeared in EC throughout the flowering period. The number of pods and the pod-setting ratio in EC condition on the secondary <b>racemes,</b> the secondary <b>racemes</b> with compound leaves and the tertiary <b>racemes</b> were larger than those in AC condition. Therefore, enrichment of CO_ 2 increased seed yield because of the increase in the number of flowers and the high pod-setting ratio on the high order <b>racemes</b> （the secondary <b>racemes,</b> the secondary <b>racemes</b> with compound leaves and the tertiary racemes）, which appeared at later time during the flowering period...|$|R

25|$|Ragweeds are monoecious, most {{producing}} inflorescences {{that contain}} both staminate and pistillate flowers. Inflorescences {{are often in}} the form of a spike or <b>raceme</b> made up mostly of staminate flowers with some pistillate clusters around the base. Staminate flower heads have stamens surrounded by whitish or purplish florets. Pistillate flower heads have fruit-yielding ovules surrounded by many phyllaries and fewer, smaller florets. The pistillate flowers are wind pollinated, and the fruits develop. They are burs, sometimes adorned with knobs, wings, or spines.|$|E
25|$|The {{inflorescence}} is compacted into a many-flowered spike, or {{a simple}} or branched <b>raceme,</b> and is apical, {{although it can}} seem axillary. Stems are monopodial (unbranched) until an inflorescence is formed, and then sympodial (potentially branched); this prevents the rosette from dying as in Agave. Flowers of all taxa within Aloeae are tubular and have some fusion of petal-like tepals, although the amount of fusion varies among genera. Differences in flower structure and colour among genera are considered to represent pollination syndromes, particularly shifts between insect and bird pollination, and so are less reliable indicators of relationships among species than was once thought. Thus Astroloba corrugata, like most species of Astroloba, has small, pale, horizontally held flowers that are insect-pollinated, whereas A.rubriflora has larger, red, vertically held flowers that are bird-pollinated.|$|E

The inflorescence is a simple or slightly branched <b>raceme.</b> Individual flowers have four petals that are rose-purple to pink, rarely white. The petals are free at the base rather than united in a floral tube, as in Epilobium. The lower petals are narrower than the upper ones, making the flower radially unsymmetric (zygomorphic). There are eight more-or-less equally sized stamens, and a long, four-lobed style. The fruit is a long, thin, four-chambered (loculicidal) capsule that splits to reveal the many seeds.
