Panta bhat (rice soaked overnight in water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas. Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen are cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger, green chillies, and turmeric. People of erstwhile East Bengal use a lot of ajmoda, coriander leaves, tamarind, coconut, and mustard in their cooking while those aboriginally from West Bengal use a lot of sugar, garam masala, and red chilli powder. Vegetarian dishes are mostly prepared without onion and garlic.|$|E

40|$|Red {{onion is}} one of the main horticultural {{commodities}} in Indonesia. Generally <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> is cultivated by using tuber as a source of seeds. The weakness of the use of tuber as a source of seeds, besides the high cost also the quality of seed is less well guaranteed because it almost always carries of the pathogen disease. To overcome the weakness of <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> cultivation with tuber, the alternative is the cultivation with the seed of botani (True Seed of Shallot/TSS). The weakness of botanical seeds as a source of seed is the low germination/growing power. Therefore, to solve the problem of <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> cultivation with TSS, has been done research on the modification of growing medium and giving of plant growth regulator to produce seeds of <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> origin of botanical seed (TSS). Botanical seeds (TSS) of <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> treated with coconut water and seeded on mixed soil + compost medium, soil + husk charcoal and soil + compost + chaff charcoal produce growing percentage and vegetative growth of optimum seeds.

40|$|Red Onion (Allium Ascolanicum) is a non-substituted {{commodity}} for Indonesian consumer. It is {{a well-known}} situation in Indonesia, where the fluctuation supply of some agriculture products like rice and also <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> may causes the economic inflation in one region.

Nagari Saning Baka {{is a well-known}} village in Solok Regency as a center of <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> production in West Sumatera Province. However, since around 1980 s, secondary data from local government showed significant decreased of production area of this crop.

This study have tried to identified factors that influence the production risk of <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> in this region by using regression analysis to test some hypothetical input factors, like numbers of seed, fertilizer, volume of pesticides, frequency of pesticides applied, labor, and variety of <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> itself. The production risk as dependent variable is identified by calculating the variance of production for each farmer. This study uses cross section data by collecting information from 70 farmers as sample. As a result, the risk analysis showed that <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> farmers are facing high risk in their farm, and higher risk in hot season compare to rainy season. The expected production of <b>red</b> <b>onion</b> is only 3. 2 Ton/Ha per planting season. The result for regression analysis showed that only three input factors have showed high significance in influencing the production risk of <b>red</b> <b>onion,</b> are; the use of single fertilizer, leaf fertilizer and the uses of pesticides...|$|R

In Australia and New Zealand, {{there are three}} Angus burgers sold; The Grand Angus (which is a clone of the Angus Deluxe) and the Mighty Angus (which resembles the Angus Cheese and Bacon, but with no pickles and mayonnaise and onion relish replacing the ketchup and mustard). For a limited time only, the Angus The Third, similar to the Grand Angus, but with no mustard and made with a tomato chili relish and only one slice of cheese. Also, for a limited time, Angus the Great was sold, a clone of the Angus Mushroom and Swiss. In October 2012, an Angus version of the Cheddar Bacon Onion (CBO) Sandwich was made available, consisting of a horseradish-like sauce, grilled caramelized onions, bacon and cheddar cheese. In May 2013, McDonald's stopped selling the Angus burger. Two years later the third-pound burgers returned (known as Sirloin Third Pound Burgers), but as a limited-time promotion. It comes in three sandwiches: Bacon & Cheese, Lettuce & Tomato, and Steakhouse. The Angus Burgers are still available in Canada and some markets in Latin America.|$|E

The Loved Ones were named after Evelyn Waugh's short and darkly satirical novel The Loved One. To round out the line-up, Humphrys, Lynch and Clyne recruited former Wild Cherries guitarist Rob Lovett.
