50|$|Due to {{the number}} of wars Spain was {{involved}} in during the early 18th century the country could not provide itself with enough soldiers for its own campaigns. This was also exacerbated by the severe loss of manpower {{as a result of a}} plague epidemic. Diplomatic approaches were made to a number of countries with <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> the <b>recruitment</b> of mercenaries to fight for Spain. Swiss, Germans, Italians and Walloons were recruited but the Spanish were particularly keen to engage Irishmen because of their reputation as soldiers. The Confederation of Kilkenny established licences <b>for</b> the <b>recruitment</b> of Irishmen to fight for the King of Spain.|$|R
2500|$|On 1 May 2009, Han posted {{an article}} on his blog {{entitled}} <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> articles, <b>recruitment,</b> article fees and article submission email address for a new magazine. [...] The post mentioned that Han would be setting up a magazine, informing the email addresses for article submission, response to recruitment ads, and advertising offers, but without revealing the magazine's title to prevent illegal copying. [...] The blog post also mentioned that the writer of the selected cover story, if the story had not been previously published, would get up to RMB 2,000 per 1,000 characters in article fees. [...] This would be 10 to 40 times of the standard rate in China's publishing industry, and 2 to 4 times higher than what China's top magazine would pay China's top writer for an article. [...] Writers of previously unpublished non-cover story articles in the magazine would be paid RMB 1,000 per 1,000 characters, 10 to 20 times higher than standard rates in the publishing industry. [...] As for previously-published articles or selected extracts from articles, the rate would be RMB 500 per 1,000 characters, which would be about 15 times the standard rates. [...] Contributors of photographs would be paid up to RMB 5,000 per photograph.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Although a {{large body}} of {{literature}} has addressed many of the issues relating to flexible working from both a supply and demand perspective, less attention has focused on situations where these two positions conflict. This research explores a secondary, qualitative data set consisting of over 200 cases of alleged family responsibilities discrimination reported to a community advocacy organization in Brisbane, Australia. Findings indicate that discord in the work environment occurs in relation to (1) <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> part-time work; (2) altered duties during or after maternity leave; (3) <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> changes to rostered work hours; (4) having to take leave to care for sick children; and (5) opportunities <b>for</b> <b>recruitment</b> or promotion. Direct family responsibilities discrimination was evident in only six cases, while the remainder were indirect. A small number of cases were formally lodged for redress although financial compensation was limited. Economic factors such as a shrinking labour force highlight the importance of finding solutions to situations where business imperatives and the well-being of families collide...|$|R

5|$|Hundreds {{of members}} of the Bosnian Muslim SS {{divisions}} volunteered to fight in the 1948–1949 Arab–Israeli War. Many were recruited by agents of al-Husayni, who achieved political leadership of the Palestinian Arabs following the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine. The Syrian government also made a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> the transfer of 8,000 Bosnian Muslim refugees to Syria, many <b>for</b> <b>recruitment</b> into the Syrian Armed Forces. Iraq sent representatives to Europe and invited 2,500 Bosnian Muslims to settle in their nation. Frantzman and Culibrk estimate that approximately 1,000 former Bosnian Muslim SS members fought in Palestine, but say it is possible that Bosnian Muslim participation was much more extensive. Contemporary Haganah intelligence records suggest that up to 4,000 Bosnian Muslim volunteers took part. Many of the volunteers served in the Arab Liberation Army's Ajnaddin Battalion, as well as the Army of the Holy War.|$|R
