40|$|Abstract – The {{theory of}} tax clienteles <b>for</b> <b>dividend</b> {{policies}} pre-dicts {{that after a}} firm initiates a cash dividend, the ownership of its equity by tax-exempt/tax-deferred and corporate investors will in-crease as these investors purchase shares of stock that are being sold by individual investors <b>for</b> whom <b>dividends</b> are tax disadvan-taged. This study provides support for this prediction. This result, which is not well explained by omitted time-dependent factors or potentially relevant nontax factors, offers convincing new evidence {{that the effects of}} tax clienteles <b>for</b> <b>dividend</b> policies are strong enough to influence the decisions of investors...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose that}} the {{decision}} to pay dividends is driven by prevailing investor demand <b>for</b> <b>dividend</b> payers. Managers cater to investors by paying dividends when investors put a stock price premium on payers, and by not paying when investors prefer nonpayers. To test this prediction, we construct four stock price-based measures of investor demand <b>for</b> <b>dividend</b> payers. By each measure, nonpayers tend to initiate dividends when demand is high. By some measures, payers tend to omit dividends when demand is low. Further analysis confirms that these results are better explained by catering than other theories of dividends...|$|R

40|$|I {{study the}} {{catering}} theory of dividends (Baker and Wurgler, 2004) and shed further {{light to the}} question: are managers catering to the demand <b>for</b> <b>dividends</b> or are companies' real growth expectations a more important driver <b>for</b> <b>dividend</b> policy. Baker and Wurgler (2004) assume inefficient stock markets and argue that corporate managers are increasing the short-term value of their companies by changing the dividend payout policy according to the investor demand <b>for</b> <b>dividends</b> i. e. catering to the dividend demand. The main challenge in interpreting the results of Baker and Wurgler (2004 a) is that they use the average market-to-book ratio of dividend payers relative to the average market-to-book ratio of nonpayers as a proxy <b>for</b> <b>dividend</b> demand. They, thus, assume that the market-to-book ratio measures the mispricing of a company - not its growth prospects. I employ an improved proxy for the demand <b>for</b> <b>dividends</b> by decomposing the market-to-book ratio to a mispricing component and a growth opportunity component. In a novel approach, I apply the decomposition of market-to-book ratio method (Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson and Viswanathan, 2005) to dividend policy decisions {{as a means of}} gaining more credible results. The decomposition method has previously been employed when studying other corporate decisions, e. g. merger activity and timing of seasoned equity offerings, but not dividend policy decisions. By decomposing the market-to-book ratio, I am able to analyse the dividend decisions from both the perceived market mispricing and individual company growth opportunity point of views. By using the traditional market-to-book ratio, as Baker and Wurgler (2004 a) have done, these separate motives are mixed. My data set consists of firm-years in the US market (NYSE, AMEX and Nasdaq) during the period of 1981 - 2008. I find no support for the catering theory of dividends. Instead, the growth opportunities of companies seem to play a more important role in dividend initiation decisions. In dividend omission decisions, it seems that neither the growth opportunities nor the catering motives explain the decisions. My findings are consistent with the trade-off/life-cycle theory of dividends...|$|R

40|$|We {{find that}} {{the sign of the}} {{correlation}} between institutional ownership and volatility depends on the firm's dividend policy: institutional ownership is negatively (positively) related to volatility among non-dividend (dividend) paying stocks.

This result is robust to many control variables and possible endogeneity concerns. Supporting our conjecture that institutions herd on dividend signals we {{find that the}} correlation between turnover and institutional ownership is higher <b>for</b> <b>dividend</b> paying stocks, and that the positive correlation between turnover and institutional ownership is higher on dividend declaration days.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} longitudinal Compustat data on {{dividend payments}} and share repurchases of over 2000 US industrial firms by using 2 -yearly averages {{for the period}} 1992 - 2007. First, dynamic auto-regressive models <b>for</b> <b>dividends</b> and share repurchases were estimated by maximum likelihood to yield consistent and efficient estimates. Second, because firms pay dividends at different rates, comprehensive dynamic and static random-effects models <b>for</b> <b>dividends</b> were estimated. Third, models were estimated for share repurchases and the interrelationships between dividends and repurchases were investigated, tackling endogeneity issues. The results showed that dividend decisions are likely to precede those regarding share repurchases, and higher dividend payments decreased the magnitudes of repurchases; the effects of repurchases on dividends were generally insignificant.

As another example, the Wilshire 4500 and Wilshire 5000 indices have five versions each: full capitalization total return, full capitalization price, float-adjusted total return, float-adjusted price, and equal weight.
