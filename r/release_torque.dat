40|$|This study {{evaluated}} <b>release</b> <b>torque</b> {{values for}} rental ski-binding-boot (S-B-B) systems that had {{one to four}} seasons use in a popular New Zealand commercial ski area. The proportions of S-B-B systems in classes of deviation from the reference release moment were determined {{according to the international}} equipment safety requirements from ASTM F 1063 - 03, ASTM F 1064 - 03, ASTM F 939 - 06, ISO 13993 : 2001, and ISO 11088 - 2006 (E). A randomly chosen sample of 9 % (124 skis/ 62 pairs) of S-B-B systems from the total ski rental fleet was tested using a Wintersteiger calibration machine. There were a high percentage of Class I deviations in the rental fleet: 50 % (2 seasons), 95 % (3 seasons), and 64 % (4 seasons). Class 1 deviations do not require corrective action; however, increased sampling is indicated. Based on the high percentage of Class I deviations the entire fleet should be inspected. Class II deviations that required immediate corrective action were found in 48 % of the S-B-B with two seasons of use. Only 8 % of the rental fleet had Class III deviations warranting removal from the rental fleet. The heel-pieces of S-B-B systems that had two or more seasons of use were nine {{times more likely to be}} out of tolerance than those with only one season of use; however, there was only a small increase in the proportion of toe-pieces out of tolerance for older compared to newer S-B-B systems. These differences may be due to age or to different models of S-B-B systems. The policy of retiring ski rental equipment after three or four seasons of use appears to be inadequate to ensure the supply of safe equipment...|$|E

Failure of binding release associated {{with a knee injury}} is significantly higher among females compared to males. The International Standards Organization ISO 11088 standard for binding setting values allows a lowering by 15 % upon request of the skier. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of lowered ski binding settings by 15 % on the outcome of the self-release test among female recreational skiers. Materials and methods: In this randomized single-blinded study, a cohort of 20 females (24. 5 ± 2. 7 years) performed the self-release test in the laboratory thrice with each leg under two conditions: 1)  with an actual ISO 11088 setting and 2) with a setting lowered by 15 %. For each attempt, torques calculated via the force plate were normalized to torques measured by a binding adjustment system (relative <b>release</b> <b>torque,</b> RRT). Results: Among 240 trials in total, more females were significantly able to self-release their ski bindings with lowered binding settings when compared to their actual ISO settings (53 % vs 9 %, p< 0. 001). Thirteen females (65 %) were able to release their bindings at least once with both legs with lowered binding settings compared to only three females (15 %) with their actual binding settings (p< 0. 001). Mean RRT of all failure of binding release trials significantly differed between lowered and actual binding settings (58. 6 %± 22. 2 % vs 50. 5 %± 20. 4 %, p= 0. 003). Conclusion: Four times more females were able to self-release their ski bindings at least once with both legs with a 15 % lowered binding setting compared to their normal ISO 11088 setting. The fact that the ISO standard accepts a lowering by 15 % upon request of the skier could represent an important measure to prevent knee injuries, especially for female recreational skiers.

40|$|Objectives: Titanium {{implants}} have {{a tendency}} for high bone-implant bonding, and, in comparison to stainless steel implants {{are more difficult to}} remove. The current study was carried out to evaluate, i) the release strength of three selected anodized titanium surfaces with increased nanohardness and low roughness, and ii) bone-implant bonding in vivo. These modified surfaces were intended to give improved anchorage while facilitating easier removal of temporary implants. Material and methods: The new surfaces were referenced to a stainless steel implant and a standard titanium implant surface (TiMAX). In a sheep limb model, healing period was 3 months. Bone-implant bonding was evaluated either biomechanically or histologically. Results: The new surface anodized screws demonstrated similar or slightly higher bone-implant-contact (BIC) and <b>torque</b> <b>release</b> forces than the titanium reference. The BIC of the stainless steel implants was significant lower than two of theh anodized surfaces (p= 0. 04), but differences between stainless steel and all titanium implants in <b>torque</b> <b>release</b> forces were not significant (p= 0. 06). Conclusion: The new anodized titanium surfaces showed good bone-implant bonding despite a smooth surface and increased nanohardness.

50|$|The ACCAR {{alternative}} to the hemispherical cruising altitude rules, if adopted in 1997, could have eliminated the navigation paradox at all altitudes, and could have saved 342 lives in over 30 midair collisions (up to November 2006) since the Risk Analysis proof that the current regulations multiply midair collision risk {{in direct proportion to}} pilot accuracy in compliance. The Namibian collision in 1997, the Japanese near-miss in 2001, the Überlingen collision in Germany in 2002, and the Amazon collision in 2006, are all examples where human or hardware errors doomed altitude-accurate pilots killed by the navigation paradox designed into the current cruising altitude rules.

40|$|Actin {{filament}} rotation in {{skeletal muscle}} is studied by a mechanical model that simulates structure and tension. The four anchoring Z-filaments are twisted around {{and change the}} structure of the Z-lattice. The “small square ” without twist represents the resting stage of muscle. Torque causes contraction by clockwise rotation (as seen from the Z-band), drilling into the A-band and transition of the “small square ” to “basket weave ” by increasing the twist and decreasing the <b>torque.</b> <b>Release</b> decreases the <b>torque</b> (“forcedepression”) by passive clockwise rotation. Stretch causes increased torque (“stretch activation”) by passive counterclockwise rotation. Torque arises during Ca 2 �-activation by a conformational change in the highly charged coiled-coils: The four �-actinin Z-filaments generate strong torque for the isometric tension. Quick release experiments show that less than one rotation reduces this torque to zero. The 5 – 12 rotations necessary for isotonic shortening result from torque-generation in the two long tropomyosin coiled-coils. Myosin controlls the velocity of active and passive rotations. © 2000 Academic Press The conventional theory of muscle contraction supposes the essential activity (the “power strokes”) and the main elasticity (the “series elastic component”) in the myosin cross-bridges (1 – 5). The reasons are discussed later in this paper. Considerable arguments against that model have been put foreward (e. g., 6 – 10). The importance of the actin filaments and the Z-bands for the origin of muscle force was largely underestimated. An alternative model explaines muscle contraction on the basis of actin filament rotations (8, 11 – 14). These rotations have been repeatedly considered (15 – 19) and were demonstrated by in vitro experiments on myosin-covered glass-surfaces (20, 21). Recently, actin filament rotation in muscle was discussed in this journal (22) in comparison with other biological rotors...|$|R
40|$|FoF 1 -ATP synthase {{manufactures}} {{the energy}} “currency,” ATP, of living cells. The soluble F 1 portion, called F 1 -ATPase, {{can act as}} a rotary motor, with ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product <b>release,</b> inducing a <b>torque</b> on the γ-subunit. A coarse-grained plastic network model is used to show at a residue level of detail how the conformational changes of the catalytic β-subunits act on the γ-subunit through repulsive van der Waals interactions to generate a torque that drives unidirectional rotation, as observed experimentally. The simulations suggest that the calculated 85 ° substep rotation is driven primarily by ATP binding and that the subsequent 35 ° substep rotation is produced by product release from one β-subunit and a concomitant binding pocket expansion of another β-subunit. The results of the simulation agree with single-molecule experiments [see, for example, Adachi K, et al.

These results {{were found to be}} congruent with the professional treatment technique used by Canadian chiropractors. This article reports on the data obtained during the 2000 and 2001 academic years, comparing these results to those previously gathered. In addition, because of the implementation of a new curriculum during this time period, there was unique opportunity to observe whether or not student perceptions differed between those students in the `old' curricular program, and those students in the `new' curricular program. The results gathered indicate that students in both curricular programs show an interest in learning Thompson Terminal Point, Activator Methods, Gonstead, and Active Release Therapy techniques in the core curriculum, as an elective, or during continuing educational programs provided by the college. Students continue to show less interest in learning CranioSacral Therapy, SacroOccipital Technique, Logan Basic, Applied Kinesiology and Chiropractic BioPhysics.

40|$|This thesis elaborates on {{design and}} {{fabrication}} of an artificial mechanical upper limb prototype for transradial amputations, i. e. {{for patients with}} stump between elbow and wrist joints. The artificial limb is designed {{for use in a}} wide spectrum of patients. Therefore, the main components are designed to be applicable to smaller as well as larger hand dimensions. The artificial mechanical limb is designed to be controlled by the other hand of a patient and enables grasping of objects via cylindrical and hook grip. Fingers are driven by tension springs and can be locked in extension. Clenching can be initiated by pressing a button, which unlocks the fingers, thus an object can be grasped. Wrist joint is adjustable when pressed a release button. Forearm joint is locked by preloaded spring. The lock of the forearm joint is <b>released</b> by sufficient <b>torque.</b> New position of the forearm joint is locked automatically when the torque is not being applied. Prototypes of the artificial mechanical upper limb were manufactured by using of rapid prototyping technologies (FDM, SLM) as well as CNC milling machine.
