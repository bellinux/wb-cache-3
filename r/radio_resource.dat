25|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>resource</b> {{management}} is often solved by scalarization; that is, {{selection of a}} network utility function that tries to balance throughput and user fairness. The choice of utility function has a large impact on the computational complexity of the resulting single-objective optimization problem. For example, the common utility of weighted sum rate gives an NP-hard problem with a complexity that scales exponentially {{with the number of}} users, while the weighted max-min fairness utility results in a quasi-convex optimization problem with only a polynomial scaling with the number of users.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>radio</b> <b>resource</b> {{management}} is {{to satisfy the}} data rates that are requested by the users of a cellular network. The main resources are time intervals, frequency blocks, and transmit powers. Each user has its own objective function that, for example, can represent some combination of the data rate, latency, and energy efficiency. These objectives are conflicting since the frequency resources are very scarce, thus {{there is a need}} for tight spatial frequency reuse which causes immense inter-user interference if not properly controlled. Multi-user MIMO techniques are nowadays used to reduce the interference by adaptive precoding. The network operator would like to both bring great coverage and high data rates, thus the operator would like to find a Pareto optimal solution that balance the total network data throughput and the user fairness in an appropriate subjective manner.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{addresses}} the virtualisation of <b>radio</b> <b>resources</b> {{as part of}} RAN virtualisation, a candidate solution for 5 G networks, {{in order to achieve}} flexibility and efficiency. A virtual RAN operates over cloud data centres (known as C-RAN) as the physical infrastructure. A V-RAN serves multiple VNOs, which do not own access infrastructure and demand for connectivity to serve their subscribers. Virtualisation of <b>radio</b> <b>resources</b> proposes to aggregate all the <b>radio</b> <b>resources</b> from different RATs and provides virtual links for each of the VNOs based on their SLAs and requirements. The architecture for the V-RAN is illustrated and briefly discussed.|$|R

30|$|In {{heterogeneous}} cellular networks, <b>radio</b> <b>resources</b> can independently be or jointly managed. A {{situation where}} <b>radio</b> <b>resources</b> are jointly managed in the heterogeneous network and each cell in RAT j (j[*]=[*] 1,...,J) has {{a total of}} Bj, 0 bbu is considered. The physical meaning of a unit of <b>radio</b> <b>resources</b> (such as time slots, code sequence, etc.) {{is dependent on the}} specific technological implementation of the radio interface. However, no matter which multiple access technology (FDMA, TDMA, CDMA, or OFDMA) is used, system capacity could be interpreted in terms of effective or equivalent bandwidth. Therefore, in this article, bandwidth required by a call is denoted by bbu, which is similar to the approach used for wireless networks in[13].|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the algorithm Courteous Priority Access to the shared commercial radio with offloading (CPAwO), for public safety network (PSN) over LTE heterogeneous networks (HetNets). We propose {{a solution for}} prioritization of PSN users {{with access to the}} commercial <b>radio</b> network <b>resources.</b> Our model offers additional <b>radio</b> <b>resources</b> to the PSN. Furthermore, it ensures a certain priority for commercial users by assigning quantities of additional <b>radio</b> <b>resources</b> through the courteous scheme. This allows delaying preemption and blocking bearers when the <b>radio</b> <b>resources</b> are limited. The other part of CPAwO model is to apply the principle of offloading {{in order to reduce the}} impact of the macrocell congestion. This technique is to switch the new bearers arriving at the LTE macrocells to small cells, in order to decrease the number of the blocked and interrupted bearers in the network. The results of the simulation showed that the allocation of <b>radio</b> <b>resources</b> via the courteous mechanism with offloading of new bearers to small cells reduces the rate of blocking bearers and delays the preemption of active bearers present in the LTE HetNets. It also reduces the cost of the end-to-end communications, thanks to the reallocation of free frequencies...|$|R

UTRAN TDD uses a hybrid solution of code and time division multiple access, called TD-CDMA. We present a fair and efficient scheduling algorithm that adapts its behavior to traffic and interference conditions. Specifically, our scheduling algorithm is able to manage the <b>radio</b> <b>resources</b> taking into account both traffic fluctuations, in the uplink and downlink direction, and variations in system interference.

30|$|Virtualization of {{wireless}} networks {{is also possible}} [43 â€“ 45].
