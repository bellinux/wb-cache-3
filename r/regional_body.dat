Twenty-five minor watercourses were added to the Authority's jurisdiction in 1973. Reorganisation in 1974 under the Water Act 1973 brought the Avon catchment into a new <b>regional</b> <b>body,</b> the Wessex Water Authority.|$|E
5|$|With the {{formation}} of WMATA in October 1966, planning of the system shifted from federal hands to a <b>regional</b> <b>body</b> {{with representatives of the}} District, Maryland and Virginia. Congressional route approval was no longer a key consideration. Instead, routes had to serve each local suburban jurisdiction to assure that they would approve bond referenda to finance the system. Because the least expensive way to build into the suburbs was to rely upon existing railroad right-of-ways, the Orange Line took much of its present form, except that it also featured a further extension along the railroad to Bowie, Maryland and along the Dulles Access Road to the Dulles Airport.|$|E

25|$|As of 2016, 422 {{million people}} have {{diabetes}} worldwide, up from an estimated 382 million people in 2013 and from 108 million in 1980. Accounting for the shifting age structure of the global population, the prevalence of diabetes is 8.5% among adults, nearly double the rate of 4.7% in 1980. Type2 makes up about 90% of the cases. Some data indicate rates are roughly equal in women and men, but male excess in diabetes {{has been found in}} many populations with higher type 2 incidence, possibly due to sex-related differences in insulin sensitivity, consequences of obesity and <b>regional</b> <b>body</b> fat deposition, and other contributing factors such as high blood pressure, tobacco smoking, and alcohol intake.|$|E
25|$|Roman Catholics are {{the second-largest}} {{religious}} group, {{and the group}} which grew {{the most in the}} 1990s. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Arlington includes most of Northern Virginia's Catholic churches, while the Diocese of Richmond covers the rest. The Virginia Conference is the <b>regional</b> <b>body</b> of the United Methodist Church. The Virginia Synod is responsible for the congregations of the Lutheran Church. The Episcopal Diocese of Virginia, Southern Virginia, and Southwestern Virginia support the various Episcopal churches. In November 2006, 15 conservative Episcopal churches voted to split from the Diocese of Virginia over its ordination of openly gay bishops and clergy; these churches continue to claim affiliation with the larger Anglican Communion through other bodies outside the United States. Though Virginia law allows parishioners to determine their church's affiliation, the diocese claims the secessionist churches' properties. The resulting property law case is a test for Episcopal churches nationwide.|$|E

500|$|The Manchester Evening Chronicle {{brought to}} the fore the issue of [...] "regional unity" [...] for the area in April 1935 under the {{headline}} [...] "Greater Manchester– The Ratepayers' Salvation". It reported on the [...] "increasing demands for {{the exploration of the}} possibilities of a greater merger of public services throughout Manchester and the surrounding municipalities". The issue was frequently discussed by civic leaders in the area at that time, particularly those from Manchester and Salford. The Mayor of Salford pledged his support to the idea, stating that he looked forward to the day when [...] "there would be a merging of the essential services of Manchester, Salford, and the surrounding districts constituting Greater Manchester." [...] Proposals were halted by the Second World War, though in the decade after it, the pace of proposals for local government reform for the area quickened. In 1947, Lancashire County Council proposed a three [...] "ridings" [...] system to meet the changing needs of the county of Lancashire, including those for Manchester and surrounding districts. Other proposals included the creation of a Manchester County Council, a directly elected <b>regional</b> <b>body.</b> In 1951, the census in the UK began reporting on South East Lancashire as a homogeneous conurbation.|$|E

2500|$|In presbyterianism, congregations {{are united}} in {{accountability}} to a <b>regional</b> <b>body</b> called the presbytery, or, in Continental Reformed terminology, the classis, {{which comes from}} the Latin word for [...] "fleet." [...] Presbyteries {{are made up of}} the minister and an elder 'commissioned' from each parish, as well as other clergy, such as theological college professors, chaplains, and retired ministers. When there is a larger number of ordained ministers than ruling elders, additional ruling elders are appointed to redress the imbalance. The commissioners of the presbytery are expected to exercise their own judgement and are not required to represent the majority view of their congregations. In some Dutch Reformed bodies, a classis serves as a delegated body, which ceases to exist in between meetings, whereas a presbytery exists perpetually.|$|E
