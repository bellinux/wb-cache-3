25|$|Heads {{may appear}} cabossed (also caboshed or caboched): {{with the head}} cleanly {{separated}} from the neck so that only the face shows; couped: with the neck cleanly separated from the body so that the whole head and neck are present; or erased: with the neck showing a <b>ragged</b> <b>edge</b> as if forcibly torn from the body. While cabossed heads are shown facing forward (affronté), heads that are couped or erased face dexter unless otherwise specified for differencing. Heads of horned beasts are often shown cabossed to display the horns, but instances {{can be found in}} any of these circumstances. A lion's head cabossed is called simply a face, and a fox's head cabossed, a mask.|$|E

500|$|Warren {{was born}} on June 22, 1949, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to middle class parents Pauline (née Reed, 1912–1995) and Donald Jones Herring (1911–1997). Warren has {{described}} her family as teetering [...] "on the <b>ragged</b> <b>edge</b> of the middle class" [...] and [...] "kind of hanging on at the edges by our fingernails". She was their fourth child, with three brothers. She was raised as a Methodist.|$|E

5000|$|The San Francisco Chronicle {{praised the}} novel as [...] "lyrical..sensuous and sensitive..a tale of lasting love", while Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "a short, poignant story, moving {{precisely}} because it has the <b>ragged</b> <b>edges</b> of reality".|$|R
2500|$|In modern popular culture, the {{portrayal}} of earthquakes is shaped {{by the memory of}} great cities laid waste, such as Kobe in 1995 or San Francisco in 1906. Fictional earthquakes tend to strike suddenly and without warning. For this reason, stories about earthquakes generally begin with the disaster and focus on its immediate aftermath, as in Short Walk to Daylight (1972), The <b>Ragged</b> <b>Edge</b> (1968) or [...] (1999). A notable example is Heinrich von Kleist's classic novella, The Earthquake in Chile, which describes the destruction of Santiago in 1647. Haruki Murakami's short fiction collection After the Quake depicts the consequences of the Kobe earthquake of 1995.|$|E
6000|$|Holmes {{moved the}} lamp, {{and we both}} bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its <b>ragged</b> <b>edge</b> that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, [...] "March, 1869," [...] and beneath were the {{following}} enigmatical notices: ...|$|E
60|$|But no. As I said, {{he fixed}} {{me with a}} cold and {{glittering}} eye, and in it was the aristocrat's undisguised contempt for the canaille. Behind him was the solid phalanx of a bourgeois society.

"Most remarkable, most remarkable," [...] murmured Professor Porter, {{clutching}} frantically at Mr. Philander {{to regain}} the balance which the sudden fright had so perilously endangered. Unfortunately for them both, Mr. Philander's center of equilibrium was {{at that very moment}} hanging upon the <b>ragged</b> <b>edge</b> of nothing, so that it needed but the gentle impetus supplied by the additional weight of Professor Porter's body to topple the devoted secretary from the limb.|$|E
60|$|Morgan le Fay rippled {{along as}} musically as ever. Marvelous woman. And what a glance she had: when it fell in reproof upon those servants, they shrunk and quailed as timid people {{do when the}} {{lightning}} flashes out of a cloud.

It was the same with that poor old Brer Uriens; he {{was always on the}} <b>ragged</b> <b>edge</b> of apprehension; she could not even turn toward him but he winced.|$|E

50|$|Dianthus superbus var. longicalycinus (長萼瞿麥), within Caryophyllaceae family (石竹科), simply {{looks like}} wild Dianthus (石竹). Dianthus can be {{recognized}} by their rather <b>ragged</b> <b>edges</b> of petals and long calyxes connected to petals. Most flowers are pink and blue. The huge amount of Dianthus gives an impression of the endemic plant in the Matsu Islands. However, Dianthus, though not common, {{can also be found}} in Taiwan.|$|R

This insect is the most serious insect pest of iris in Nebraska and is found virtually everywhere in the state.

60|$|This palace was far, {{far away}} toward the rising sun, immeasurably remote, astronomically remote, in Newport, Rhode Island, Holy Land of High Society, ineffable Domain of the American Aristocracy. As a rule {{they spent a}} part of every Sabbath--after morning service--in this sumptuous home, {{the rest of it}} they spent in Europe, or in dawdling around in their private yacht. Six days of sordid and plodding fact life at home on the <b>ragged</b> <b>edge</b> of Lakeside and straitened means, the seventh in Fairyland--such had been their program and their habit.|$|E
60|$|The {{filaments}} I could plainly enough {{perceive to}} be even, round, cylindrical, transparent bodies, and to cross each other every way, that is, there were not more seem'd to lie horizontally then perpendicularly and thwartway, {{so that it is}} somewhat difficult to conceive how they should grow in that manner. By tearing off a small piece of it, and looking on the <b>ragged</b> <b>edge,</b> I could among several of those fibres perceive small joints, that is, one of those hairs split into two, each of the same bigness with the other out of which they seem'd to grow, but having not lately had an opportunity of examining their manner of growth, I cannot positively affirm any thing of them.|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "mansion"--the Colonel's {{usual name}} for the house--was a rickety old two-story frame of {{considerable}} size, which had been painted, some time or other, but had nearly forgotten it. It was away out in the <b>ragged</b> <b>edge</b> of Washington and had once been somebody's country place. It had a neglected yard around it, with a paling fence that needed straightening up, in places, and a gate that would stay shut. By the door-post were several modest tin signs. [...] "Col. Mulberry Sellers, Attorney at Law and Claim Agent," [...] was the principal one. One learned from the others that the Colonel was a Materializer, a Hypnotizer, a Mind-Cure dabbler; and so on. For {{he was a man}} who could always find things to do.|$|E

"Not a {{pleasant}} {{place to be}} caught in a squall," [...] returned the other, gazing through the voluminous clouds of smoke which he emitted at several coral reefs, whose <b>ragged</b> <b>edges</b> just rose {{to the level of the}} calm sea without breaking its mirror-like surface; [...] "I've seen one or two fine vessels caught that way, just hereabouts, and go right down in the middle of the breakers." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wound {{cleansing}} is {{a fundamental}} component of wound care. It consists of the removal of foreign matter, dead (devitalized) tissue and other physical impedimenta to healing, such as <b>ragged</b> <b>edges.</b> However, {{it is interesting to}} note that despite the move in the 21st century toward evidence-based practice, the only general consensus that exists here is that cleansing and excision reduce infection rates. The recommendation has been made that cleansing is required when: ...|$|R
60|$|From {{rubbing his}} nose with the ruler, to poising {{it in his hand}} and giving it an {{occasional}} flourish after the tomahawk manner, the transition was easy and natural. In some of these flourishes it went close to Miss Sally's head; the <b>ragged</b> <b>edges</b> of the head-dress fluttered with the wind it raised; advance it but an inch, and that great brown knot was on the ground: yet still the unconscious maiden worked away, and never raised her eyes.|$|R
60|$|At {{last they}} reached the <b>ragged</b> <b>edge</b> of timber-line, and there, rolling away under the mist, lay the bare, grassy, upward-climbing, naked neck of the great peak. The wind had grown keener moment by moment, and {{when they left the}} storm-twisted pines below, its breath had a wintry nip. The rain had ceased to fall, but the clouds still hung densely to the loftiest summits. It was a {{sinister}} yet beautiful world--a world as silent as a dream, and through the short, thick grass the slender trail ran like a timid serpent. The hour seemed to have neither daytime nor season. All was obscure, mysterious, engulfing, and hostile. Had he been alone the youth would have been appalled by the prospect.|$|E
60|$|From {{his point}} of {{perspective}} he saw himself an outcast from society, forever to be a shady skulker along the <b>ragged</b> <b>edge</b> of respectability; a denizen des trois-quartz de monde, that pathetic spheroid lying between the haut and the demi, whose inhabitants envy each of their neighbours, and are scorned by both. He was self-condemned to this opinion, as he was self-exiled, through it, to this quaint Southern city a thousand miles from his former home. Here he had dwelt for longer than a year, knowing but few, keeping in a subjective world of shadows which was invaded at times by the perplexing bulks of jarring realities. Then {{he fell in love}} with a girl whom he met in a cheap restaurant, and his story begins.|$|E
6000|$|Take {{the lens}} {{and look at}} every piece of the work from corner to corner--note {{especially}} as a thing which would only have been enjoyed by a painter, and which all great painters do intensely enjoy--the fringe of the tent, [Footnote: [...] "I think Jabal's tent is made of leather; the relaxed intervals between the tent-pegs show a curved <b>ragged</b> <b>edge</b> like leather near the ground" [...] (Mr. Caird). The edge of the opening is still more characteristic, I think.] and precise insertion of its point in {{the angle of the}} hexagon, prepared for by the archaic masonry indicated in the oblique joint above; [Footnote: Prints of these photographs which do not show the masonry all round the hexagon are quite valueless for study.] architect and painter thinking at once, and doing as they thought.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, {{the fire}} still blazed noisily on the cheerful hearth; but the storm, as if disdaining {{the office of}} {{heightening}} the human horror of the farm-house scene, was rapidly subsiding. The thunder pealed less frequently and less loudly, the wind fell into intervals of noiseless calm, and occasionally the moonlight streamed, in momentary brightness, through the <b>ragged</b> <b>edges</b> of the fast breaking clouds. The breath of the still morning was already moving upon the firmament of the stormy night.|$|R
50|$|D. devisi is a short, {{thick and}} {{slightly}} flat snake. The eyes are set {{near the top}} of the head and have a conspicuous iris. D. devisi is yellowish brown to olive green in colour with irregular, <b>ragged</b> <b>edged</b> narrow dark bands running across the body. De Vis's banded snake is usually confused with death adders as both have thick, banded bodies. The main difference is that the De Vis' banded snake’s tail does not taper abruptly and its head is not broad and triangular.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of the CCC, a [...] "can opener" [...] {{approach}} was used, with a small bent needle making small incisions around the anterior surface of the lens, forming a somewhat continuous hole that the lens could be removed through. However, any of these <b>ragged</b> <b>edges</b> could promote a tear that could proceed outwards. A CCC when done correctly, does not have any edges, and any forces applied to the capsule during surgery are distributed and do not result in a tear.|$|R
