The workout rooms and locker rooms were also altered in this remodel. The space below the theater is used for arts classes, a sacristy (to be used for liturgies and Masses), and weight/workout rooms.

500|$|The porte-cochère of {{the hotel}} {{featured}} three great sharp-edged pillars jutting {{out in front of}} the glass-fronted building, angling down into the ground, which resembled fins. The two-story glass walled entry was bordered by a wall of imported Italian marble, and above the entrance area was a horizontal plane with copper lights suspended from the beams. [...] Rather than being polished, the marble was unusual in that it was rough and grained. Natural and stained cork was used throughout the building. A.J. Leibling of The New Yorker described the hotel in 1953: [...] "The main building of the Sands is a great rectangular hall, with the <b>reception</b> <b>desk</b> in one corner, slot machines along one long wall and a bar and cocktail lounge, complete with Latin trio, along the opposite wall. In the middle is a jumble of roulette and craps tables and 21 layouts." [...] The casino, of substantial size, was accessed by three sets of terrazzo stairs, and was lit by low-hanging chandeliers. The bar featured bas-reliefs with a Western theme, including cowboys, racing wagons and Joshua trees, designed by Allan Stewart of Claremont College, California. The Garden Room restaurant overlooked the hotel's pool and landscaped grounds.|$|E
500|$|The FBI {{already had}} the lodge under {{investigation}} at the time due to the connection to Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., who was staying {{there at the time}} that Sinatra's deal was finalized. There were concerns that Kennedy was involved in the arrangement of a casino for use by the American mafia. [...] The FBI suspected that the expansion was made using funds borrowed from Jimmy Hoffa. Following a request by Robert Kennedy, who had concerns over the press coverage of his and his brother's relationships with Marilyn Monroe, Sinatra made accommodation available for her for a weekend prior to her death on August 4, 1962. During this period she was not allowed to leave and only Giancana was allowed to visit her. Even her former husband, Joe DiMaggio, was turned away. She attempted suicide through an overdose, but contacted the <b>reception</b> <b>desk</b> and was rushed to hospital where she had her stomach pumped. The cabin, known as Monroe's, and another, known as Sinatra's, are still part of the guest accommodation. Also in that year, a federal investigation took place into a prostitution ring being run from the foyer of the Cal Neva.|$|E

[...] One {{of the chief}} features was the interior garden court, with fountains and flowers, walls of white terracotta, frescoes and stained glass. The entrance hall was built in Sienna marble, with a mosaic title floor and a coffered ceiling. [...] The original <b>reception</b> <b>desk</b> of the Waldorf Hotel became a registration desk when it merged with the Astoria Hotel in 1897. Beyond the lobby was the main corridor leading to the Empire Room, with an alcove off it containing the elevators and grand staircase. Near this was the Marie Antoinette parlor, which {{was used as a}} reception room for women. It contained 18th century antiques brought back by Boldt and his wife from an 1892 visit to Europe, including a bust of Marie Antoinette, and an antique clock which was once owned by her. The Empire Room was the largest and most lavishly adorned room in the Waldorf, and soon after opening, it became one of the best restaurants in New York City, rivaling Delmonico's and Sherry's. It was modeled after the grand salon in King Ludwig's palace at Munich, with satin hangings, upholstery and marble pillars, all of pale green, and Crowninshield's frescoes. Empire in style, the Waldorf's restaurant feathered columns of dark-green marble, and the pilasters that came opposite them were of mahogany, with ormolu work in the panels. The Waldorf State Apartments, consisting of nine suites, were located on the second floor. The apartments, including the Henry IV Drawing Room, the Francois V Bedroom, which was a reproduction of the room at the Palais de Fontainebleau, had their own music room and a banquet hall to seat 20, with a handsome china collection including 48 Sevres plates with European portraits.|$|E

40|$|We {{have all}} {{experienced}} difficulty using everyday things. Video recorders, mobile phones, and microwave ovens are technological miracles, {{when you think}} about it, but they aim to help us perform relatively simple tasks. So, why aren’t they easier to use? Door handles, can openers, pushchairs, and food packaging may seem relatively basic in terms of their technology, but these mundane products confuse, perplex, and frustrate us when they appear impossible to use. Donald Norman’s book, The Design of Everyday Things [1], provides many examples of usability failures and explains the challenges of and possible routes towards user-centered design. Since the first computers were built, much of the mystique surrounding the software systems that run on them {{stems from the fact that}} software is rarely intuitive. Many people work for companies that have implemented difficult-to-use applications. Anyone observing the people at supermarket checkouts, hotel <b>reception</b> <b>desks,</b> or the next desk at his or her own office will have seen and heard frustration expressed at the system being used. If a company implements an unusable system, its employees will probably get on with their jobs, but they are likely to be less efficient and comfortable than should be the case. But these are captive users. Put an unusable site onto the Web, and your users will not stick around very long. Your users have the freedom to abandon your site and visit your competitors’. It may have been possible to implement difficult-to-use systems in the past, but it is no longer...|$|R
40|$|The risk of {{developing}} Type 2 diabetes is increasing at epidemic proportions, and is 12 - 17 % higher in Marion County Florida than it is across the state, based on Florida Department of Health statistics. The purpose of this DNP project {{was to determine if}} awareness of individual risk {{of developing}} Type 2 diabetes through a questionnaire would result in high-risk participants agreeing to attend a diabetes prevention program (DPP) at a local medical clinic. The health belief model and Rosswurm and Larrabeeâ??s model for change were used as frameworks. The review of the literature showed that prevention programs were highly effective in reducing the {{risk of developing}} diabetes. A validated diabetes risk questionnaire was placed at <b>reception</b> <b>desks</b> at 3 clinic sites. Forty-four anonymous participants completed the questionnaire. The convenience sample obtained from the questionnaire provided a score that categorized individuals into a high-risk and a low-risk group. Quantitative data from the participants were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Twenty-one of the participants indicated they were at high risk of developing diabetes. Ninety-five percent of those who received a high-score on the diabetes risk questionnaire responded that they would be interested in participating in a DPP at a local medical clinic. As a result of the DNP project completion, a DPP with the goal of reducing the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes will be implemented in the Marion County medical clinic. Future collaboration with health care and community organizations will assist to expand DPPâ??s, bring awareness of diabetes risk, and promote social change...|$|R

The glass curtain wall received new mechanical louvers. The interior wall coverings of dark wood paneling and bronzed aluminum were replaced with a cream-colored travertine wainscoting topped by a band of polished stone. Fabric covered the walls above the band, and white wooden grills were used to help break up the space. A new terrazzo floor in pastel colors was also installed. The old <b>reception</b> <b>desk</b> was removed, and a new, curvilinear <b>reception</b> <b>desk</b> was emplaced.
