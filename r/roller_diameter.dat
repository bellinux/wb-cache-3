50|$|While {{roller cam}} {{followers}} {{are similar to}} roller bearings, {{there are quite a}} few differences. Standard ball and roller bearings are designed to be pressed into a rigid housing, which provides circumferential support. This keeps the outer race from deforming, so the race cross-section is relatively thin. In the case of cam followers the outer race is loaded at a single point, so the outer race needs a thicker cross-section to reduce deformation. However, in order to facilitate this the <b>roller</b> <b>diameter</b> must be decreased, which also decreases the dynamic bearing capacity.|$|E

Two of the world’s largest bearing producers, SKF [3] and Timken [4] promoted energy efficient bearings based on their abilities to grind rollers to reduced radial deviation from round (OOR).

For example, tapered roller bearing designers typically specified rollers of minimum length to reduce problems associated with rolling contact.

(2) Changes in the size of the diameter of the roller CVT 17 mm produces decreased power because of too rapid movement of the roller is not in accordance with engine speed so that the workload is too imposing received roller CVT.

30|$|During the {{oscillating}} twin-roll {{strip casting}} process, {{the quality of}} final products is directly influenced by the flow field distribution of molten metal in the pool. The variation in the flow field is caused by oscillating roller benefits, for homogeneous distribution of strip impurity, and decreasing the grain size. Thus, {{the quality of the}} strip could be improved. A numerical model was developed using the multiphase flow technology, coupled with heat transfer, fluid flow, solidification, and oscillation. Furthermore, a transient algorithm was adopted for simulating the oscillating twin-roll strip casting process of AlSi 9 Cu 3 and 3104 aluminum alloy. This paper focuses on the flow distribution in the pool, in comparison with the traditional vertical twin-roll strip casting process, while the amplitude or frequency is changing with the definite value of casting velocity, <b>roller</b> <b>diameter,</b> nozzle angle, and the strip thickness. Consequently, the conclusions were experimentally validated by oscillating twin-roll 3104 aluminum alloy strip casting. Vibrating casting technology can change the flow field in the pool by vibration, which can improve the quality of the strip core.|$|E

40|$|The {{limiting}} {{shear stress}} coefficient {{has been studied}} in a impacting ball apparatus for four different lubricating oils at - 30 ºC and 20 ºC. The {{results show that the}} most interesting effects are; oil type, maximum contact pressure, temperature, and the interaction between the above mentioned parameters. A theoretical study has been used to investigate the possibility of using optical interferometry for pressure and viscosity measurements in a fully flooded EHD point contact. From the theoretical study it can be concluded that a film thickness map obtained from an optical interferometry method can be used both for pressure and for viscosity measurements. However, to get reliable results from the viscosity calculations, the measurements must be very accurate. Using photographs from a high-speed video camera, it was confirmed that the main part of a lubricating film will appear {{at the end of the}} contact time for a contact simultaneously subjected to squeeze and sliding motion. This corresponds with earlier findings using totally different equipment for electric detection of the asperity contact. The present investigation used a ball and glass disc apparatus. A simple iterative method is used for the computation of the central film thickness in a fully flooded elastohydrodynamic point contact lubricated with a polymeric viscosity-index-improved base oil. The shear stress dependence of the VI-improved base oil is included in the iterative method. Experimental data are presented on temporary viscosity loss and central film thickness at different temperatures from - 8 ºC to 40 ºC. A good approximation of the central film thickness is achieved by using an iterative method. A ball and disc apparatus was used to investigate the lubricant replenishment of a grease-lubricated elastohydrodynamic point contact. In starved conditions in the grease-lubricated contact, a primary reservoir is formed at the sides of the contact. This reservoir governs the replenishment of the contact. The slide to roll ratio and the friction torque was measured for a grease lubricated roller bearing at - 30 ºC and 20 ºC. A numerical model for the roller motion was also built; only the rheology of the base oil to the grease is used in the model. It could be concluded that the degree of sliding, in the unloaded zone, is mainly dependent on the local distribution of the lubricant and the position of the roller.
