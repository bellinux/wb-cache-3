5|$|There {{were three}} general dinosaur faunas {{in the late}} Cretaceous. In the {{northern}} continents of North America and Asia, the major theropods were tyrannosaurids and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods, with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and pachycephalosaurians. In the southern continents that had made up the now-splitting Gondwana, abelisaurids were the common theropods, and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores. Finally, in Europe, dromaeosaurids, rhabdodontid iguanodontians, nodosaurid ankylosaurians, and titanosaurian sauropods were prevalent. Flowering plants were greatly <b>radiating,</b> with the first grasses appearing {{by the end of}} the Cretaceous. Grinding hadrosaurids and shearing ceratopsians became extremely diverse across North America and Asia. Theropods were also <b>radiating</b> as herbivores or omnivores, with therizinosaurians and ornithomimosaurians becoming common.|$|E

5000|$|Effective <b>radiated</b> {{power and}} {{effective}} isotropic <b>radiated</b> power both measure {{the amount of}} power a radio transmitter and antenna (or other source of electromagnetic waves) <b>radiates</b> in a specific direction: {{in the direction of}} maximum signal strength (the [...] "main lobe") of its radiation pattern. [...] This maximum <b>radiated</b> power is dependent on two factors: the total power output and the radiation pattern of the antenna - how much of that power is <b>radiated</b> in the desired direction. The latter factor is quantified by the antenna gain, which is the ratio of the signal strength <b>radiated</b> by an antenna to that <b>radiated</b> by a standard antenna. For example, a 1000 watt transmitter feeding an antenna with a gain of 4 (6 dBi) will have the same signal strength in the direction of its main lobe, and thus the same ERP and EIRP, as a 4000 watt transmitter feeding an antenna with a gain of 1 (0 dBi). So ERP and EIRP are measures of <b>radiated</b> power that can compare transmitters with different antennas on an equal basis.|$|R
5000|$|Gain is a {{parameter}} {{which measures}} {{the degree of}} directivity of the antenna's radiation pattern.

5000|$|Connections {{between the}} {{imperial}} <b>radiate</b> crown and {{the cult of}} Sol are postulated. Augustus was posthumously depicted with <b>radiate</b> crown, as were living emperors from Nero (after AD 65) to Constantine. Some modern scholarship interprets the imperial <b>radiate</b> crown as a divine, solar association rather than an overt symbol of Sol; Bergmann calls it a pseudo-object designed to disguise the divine and solar connotations {{that would otherwise be}} politically controversial but there is broad agreement that coin-images showing the imperial <b>radiate</b> crown are stylistically distinct from those of the solar crown of rays; the imperial <b>radiate</b> crown is depicted as a real object rather than as symbolic light. Hijmans argues that the Imperial <b>radiate</b> crown represents the honorary wreath awarded to Augustus, perhaps posthumously, to commemorate his victory at the battle of Actium; he points out that henceforth, living emperors were depicted with <b>radiate</b> crowns, but state divi were not. To Hijmans this implies the <b>radiate</b> crown of living emperors as a link to Augustus. His successors automatically inherited (or sometimes acquired) the same offices and honours due to Octavian as [...] "saviour of the Republic" [...] through his victory at Actium, piously attributed to Apollo-Helios.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>radiated</b> {{electromagnetic}} disturbances {{produced by}} operating electromotor equipments in coal mines have some {{effects on the}} electromagnetic environment in coal mines. Based on {{the analysis of the}} Chinese national EMC standard on rotating electrical machines and the operation characteristics of the electromotor equipments in coal mines, it can be concluded that frequency spectrum of the <b>radiated</b> disturbances resulting from AC motors ranges from 9 kHz to 1 GHz. The <b>radiated</b> electromagnetic disturbances in the pumping house underground mines have been measured. The results show that the <b>radiated</b> emissions above 30 MHz produced by the normal running electromotor system are quite low, which are comparable to the <b>radiated</b> emission limits set in the Chinese national standard GB 755 - 2008 ； the maximum <b>radiated</b> field strength reaches about 0. 56 V/m under 30 MHz. However, when motors start or stop, the <b>radiated</b> field strength can reach about 1. 26 V/m or higher. Therefore, some shielding measures for monitoring and communication equipments should be taken to reduce the radiation interference from AC motors...|$|R
