5000|$|The cement {{is made by}} fusing {{together}} a mixture of a calcium-bearing material (normally calcium oxide from limestone) and an aluminium-bearing material (normally bauxite for general purposes, or refined alumina for white and <b>refractory</b> <b>cements).</b> The liquified mixture cools to a vesicular, basalt-like clinker which is ground alone to produce the finished product. Because complete melting usually takes place, raw materials in lump-form can be used. A typical kiln arrangement comprises a reverberatory furnace provided with a shaft preheater in which the hot exhaust gases pass upward as the lump raw material mix passes downward. The preheater recuperates most of the heat in the combustion gases, dehydrates and de-hydroxylates the bauxite and de-carbonates the limestone. The calcined material drops into the [...] "cool end" [...] of the melt bath. The melt overflows the hot end of the furnace into molds in which it cools and solidifies. The system is fired with pulverized coal or oil. The cooled clinker ingots are crushed and ground in a ball-mill.

40|$|Abstract. A self-flow {{refractory}} castable (SFRC) without cement requires {{a matrix of}} fine particles and a broad size distribution of coarse particles (aggregate). The matrix ensures the rheological behaviour and performs the binding role of the absent <b>refractory</b> <b>cement.</b> The presence of the aggregate coarse particles hinders the flowability index (FI), but improves the castable mechanical strength and reduces firing shrinkage. A new methodology of SFRC particle distribution design was developed, using response surface statistical modelling and commercial alumina powders (reactive and tabular). First, {{the composition of the}} fine matrix was optimised, seeking minimum water content and maximum IF. To this matrix, various aggregate distributions, combining six tabular alumina size fractions and with different Andreasen distribution modulus, q, between 0. 18 to 0. 28, were added, to identify the composition with maximum FI. The results obtained show that a minimum specific surface area (SSA) of 2. 22 m 2 /g is necessary to reach the self-flow turning point, after which the largest FI requires the maximisation of the aggregate maximum paste thickness (MPT), corresponding to a distribution with q= 0. 22.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author © 2006 Dr. Peter DuxsonGeopolymers are a relatively new class of material that has many broad applications, including use {{as a substitute for}} Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), use in soil stabilisation, fire resistant panels, <b>refractory</b> <b>cements,</b> and inorganic adhesives. The synthetic alkali aluminosilicate structure of geopolymer results in a highly versatile material that can be synthesised en masse, cost competitively and from a wide varietyof aluminosilicate bearing raw materials. Despite the commercial promise and technical viability of the technology, the fundamental understanding of the chemical structure and characteristics of geopolymeric materials, and to some degree the academic rigor of some aspects of the science related to geopolymers, leave a lot to be desired. In particular, the understanding of the effects of Si/Al ratio and alkali cation type on the molecular structure of the binder, and how these relate to the microstructure and mechanical and thermal properties are poorly understood. The thesis explores the structure and characteristics of a systematic multi-dimensional matrix of geopolymers derived from metakaolin, a relatively pure aluminosilicate source. The thesis addresses the determination of the core molecular structure of geopolymers by solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and how this is altered by the nominal Si/Al ratio and alkali cation type. The chemical ordering is observed to reduce with Si/Al ratio and with inclusion of potassium over sodium. Most significantly, the presence of Al-O-Al linkages is identified {{for the first time in}} specimens with Si/Al ratios close to unity, by the application of 17 O NMR techniques on geopolymers. The role of molecular structure and gel chemistry of geopolymers is elucidated, and links are drawn to understand the development of the microstructure and physical properties of the material. The thermal evolution of geopolymeric gels derived from metakaolin is investigated in terms of physical and structural development when exposed to temperatures up to 1000 °C. The response of geopolymers to heating is characterised into four regions regardless of the extent of shrinkage or crystallisation. Several critical material performance relationships exist that are related to both the microstructure and chemical composition. The thesis presents an updated structural model of geopolymers to include new insights obtained from application of solid-state NMR techniques and thermal analysis. The improvements in structural understanding described in the thesis have the potential to affect all aspects of geopolymer science. Open Acces...|$|R

Department of Energy and conducted by the Bureau of Mines, to evaluate refractory liner materials for coal gasifier reactors. Commercially available refractories were exposed to coal gasifier reactor environments, reproduced in the laboratory with a high-temperature, high-pressure test facility, followed by extensive postexposure evaluation. Thirty-six castable or gunnable <b>refractories</b> and <b>cements</b> and 24 <b>refractory</b> brick were evaluated. The behavior of castable refractories reinforced with stainless steel fibers was also examined. Gas environments that were evaluated included steam, H 2, CO 2, CO, and typical high-and low-Btu gas mixtures. Exposure pressures ranged from 100 to 1, 000 psig, temperatures from 5000 to 1, 1000 C, for periods from 50 h to 2, 000 h. In some exposures, sodium and/or potassium hydroxide were introduced in order to simulate a high-alkali environment. It was found that intermediate-and low-alumina refractories produced from domestically available raw materials, rather than high-alumina refractories produced from imported raw materials, gave the best service as liner materials and that alkali attack was probably not a serious problem with most refractories.

The product has been designed for developing areas in Nicaragua where power is inaccessible and a multi-purpose cookstove/phone charger could be of use. The cookstove features a cylindrical combustion chamber {{that can be used}} for gasification. Gasification is a burning process where smoke from the fire is also burned, creating higher temperatures and a cleaner burn. The combustion chamber is insulated using <b>refractory</b> <b>cement,</b> which will drop the temperature from about 700 Celsius inside the chamber to 200 Celsius outside the chamber. The cookstove outputs heat at a rate of 4. 6 - 6. 6 kW. The cookstove has thermoelectric modules attached to the outside, which, by utilizing the Seebeck effect, convert excess heat into electrical energy. Ideally, the energy would be transferred into the phone at 5 volts and 0. 5 - 0. 6 amps and some of the electrical energy would be used to power a cooling fan to help the stove function properly. The final temperatures that were recorded ranged from around 400 ºC to 700 ºC in the combustion chamber and around 500 ºC for the cooking surface. Gasification was successfully occurring during this stage, and the smoke was being visibly burned off. The electrical output was less successful, resulting with only around 0. 08 V coming out of the thermoelectric generators due to the lack of air flow within the electrical housing and poor electrical connection.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{effectiveness}} of sodium silicate-activated Class F fly ash in improving the thermal shock resistance and in extending the onset of hydration of Secar # 80 <b>refractory</b> <b>cement.</b> When the dry mix cement, consisting of Secar # 80, Class F fly ash, and sodium silicate, {{came in contact with}} water, NaOH derived from the dissolution of sodium silicate preferentially reacted with Class F fly ash, rather than the # 80, to dissociate silicate anions from Class F fly ash. Then, these dissociated silicate ions delayed significantly the hydration of # 80 possessing a rapid setting behavior. We undertook a multiple heating -water cooling quenching-cycle test to evaluate the cement’s resistance to thermal shock. In one cycle, we heated the 200 and # 61616;C-autoclaved cement at 500 and # 61616;C for 24 hours, and then the heated cement was rapidly immersed in water at 25 and # 61616;C. This cycle was repeated five times. The phase composition of the autoclaved # 80 /Class F fly ash blend cements comprised four crystalline hydration products, boehmite, katoite, hydrogrossular, and hydroxysodalite, responsible for strengthening cement. After a test of 5 -cycle heat-water quenching, we observed three crystalline phase-transformations in this autoclaved cement: boehmite and # 61614; and # 61543;-Al 2 O 3, katoite and # 61614; calcite, and hydroxysodalite and # 61614; carbonated sodalite. Among those, the hydroxysodalite and # 61614; carbonated sodalite transformation not only played a pivotal role in densifying the cementitious structure and in sustaining the original compressive strength developed after autoclaving, but also offered an improved resistance of the # 80 cement to thermal shock. In contrast, autoclaved Class G well cement with and without Class F fly ash and quartz flour failed this cycle test, generating multiple cracks in the cement. The major reason for such impairment was the hydration of lime derived from the dehydroxylation of portlandite formed in the autoclaved cement, causing its volume to expand...|$|E

X-ray fluorescence (XRF) studies were conducted to determine the chemical composition of the kaolin deposits. Kaolinite was the predominant mineral, followed by quartz, with traces of illite-muscovite, Fe-bearing minerals (hematite), anatase and feldspar. The average chemical composition of the kaolin samples was 58. 02 wt. % SiO 2, 28. 00 % Al 2 O 3, 1. 48 % Fe 2 O 3, 1. 26 % TiO 2 and 0. 41 % K 2 O (ignited basis).
