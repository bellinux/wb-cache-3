5|$|May 2006 {{was very}} busy for Konnan. In AAA, {{he made his}} first {{appearance}} with La Legión Extranjera (with Chessman & Ron Killings) on May 1, 2006, losing to El Zorro, Octagon & Vampiro Canadiense at AAA Sin Limite. He soon became the leader of the stable, which was active through 2009. That same month, Konnan became the TNA Impact! Spanish color commentator. Additionally, he and the LAX began a storyline that saw them <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> wrestle (as well as himself and Moody Jack <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> commentate), claiming that Latinos were discriminated against within TNA.|$|E

50|$|Christians {{were the}} targets of {{persecution}} because they <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> worship the Roman gods or {{to pay homage to}} the emperor as divine. In the Roman Empire, <b>refusing</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice to the Emperor or the empire's gods was tantamount <b>to</b> <b>refusing</b> <b>to</b> swear an oath of allegiance to one's country.|$|R

5|$|All {{of these}} {{positions}} were nominally {{appointed by the}} Emperor and their holders were answerable directly to him. Nevertheless, from 1936 the Japanese Army and Navy held, effectively, a legal right to nominate (or <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> nominate) their respective ministers. Thus, they could prevent the formation of undesirable governments, or by resignation bring about the collapse of an existing government.|$|E
5|$|Conscientious objectors (COs) <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> {{participate}} in military service because of belief or religious training. During wartime, this stance conflicts with conscription efforts. Those {{willing to accept}} non-combatant roles, such as medical personnel, are accommodated. There are few legal options for draftees who cannot cooperate with the military in any way.|$|E
5|$|George {{objected to}} the anti-Catholic wording of the Accession Declaration {{that he would be}} {{required}} to make at the opening of his first parliament. He made it known that he would <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> open parliament unless it was changed. As a result, the Accession Declaration Act 1910 shortened the declaration and removed the most offensive phrases.|$|E
25|$|The mines reopened under National Guard protection, {{and many}} {{went back to}} work. The {{companies}} instituted the 8-hour day, but <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> set a $3 per day minimum wage, <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> abandon the one-man drill, and especially <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> employ Western Federation of Miners members.|$|R

Once again, Somma <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> have his name appear on the libretto.|$|R

5|$|He was accepted, and {{although}} his appointment delighted Murray, {{the government was}} very concerned {{at the loss of}} a good Attorney General. In an attempt to persuade him to stay, the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Newcastle offered him the Duchy of Lancaster, in addition to the position of Attorney General, an extra £6,000 a year, and a pension, and finally attempted to blackmail him by saying that if he accepted the office of Lord Chief Justice, the government would <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> grant him a peerage. It was customary for all Lord Chief Justices to be given a peerage, and Murray responded by saying that in that situation he would <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> become either Lord Chief Justice or Attorney General. Newcastle gave in, and promised to allow him to become Lord Chief Justice and to recommend him for a peerage.|$|E
5|$|In most circumstances, {{in order}} to become law a bill must be first passed by both houses of the Diet and then {{promulgate}}d by the Emperor. This role of the Emperor is similar to the Royal Assent in some other nations; however, the Emperor cannot <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> promulgate a law and therefore his legislative role is merely a formality.|$|E
5|$|King Philip V and Frederick IV of Denmark paid Violante Beatrice visits in 1703 and 1709, respectively. The former {{chose to}} ignore {{the other members of}} the Tuscan Royal Family and reluctantly deigned only speak to her. The latter, on the other hand, was taken with Violante, going as far as to <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> leave the room while she was {{changing}} clothes.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Tobin became {{disenchanted with}} the Democratic Party and President Harry S. Truman. For {{the first time}} since 1928, he <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> be a {{delegate}} to the Democratic National Convention, and <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> speak at the convention when invited to do so. In the 1948 presidential election, he <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> endorse Truman, <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> put the resources of the national Teamsters union behind Truman's re-election, and told local unions to vote their conscience.|$|R
5|$|The abductors <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> give Foster any {{explanation}} {{as to what is}} happening.

5|$|The child Baldwin V of Jerusalem died in {{late summer}} 1186. Raymond of Tripoli and his {{supporters}} could not prevent BaldwinV's mother, Sybilla, and her husband, Guy of Lusignan, from seizing the throne. Baldwin of Ibelin, who was the only Jerusalemite baron to <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> pay homage to Sybilla and Guy after their coronation, moved to Antioch. Bohemond granted a fief to him.|$|E
5|$|The story I {{am going}} to tell is a horrible one: I beg that daughters and fathers should hold {{themselves}} aloof, while I sing, or if they find my songs enchanting, let them <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> believe this part of my tale, and suppose that it never happened: or else, if they believe that it did happen, they must believe also in the punishment that followed.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} {{competing}} hypotheses about the ultimate {{fate of the}} Universe and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible. Some physicists have suggested various multiverse hypotheses, in which the Universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.|$|E
5|$|We’re flattered, of course, that Madonna and Björk {{have offered}} to perform with us. But the only {{performances}} we’ll participate in are illegal ones. We <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> perform {{as part of the}} capitalist system, at concerts where they sell tickets.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey of}} American adults {{conducted}} by YouGov in September 2015 found that 56% supported Judge Bunning's decision to jail Davis for contempt of court, while 31% of Americans opposed the decision. When asked what Davis should do, 65% said that Davis should resign from office; 23% said that Davis {{should stay in}} office and continue to <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples; and 4% said that Davis should remain in office but issue licenses to all persons legally entitled to one.|$|E

She refused paramedics' attempts to put her on a stretcher, returned to her vehicle, and continued to <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> cooperate. She then attempted {{to walk away from the}} scene, but was prevented from doing so by a male police officer, whom she then slapped. She was handcuffed and charged with careless driving, refusing a breathalyser test, and two counts of assault on a police officer. She was released on HK$5,000 bail.|$|E
5|$|Discovery {{procedures}} for defendants began with adoption of state {{laws in the}} 1920s. In the following decades, courts began instituting new procedures. In 1962, for example, the California Supreme Court ordered reciprocal discovery rules, without an initial law requiring it. However, a series of problems surfaced with this judicially imposed system. Not only did both sides <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> share intended testimony, but no 'alibi notice rule' was fashioned, leading to an unworkable position for both sides. In 1974, the California Supreme Court ordered the legislature to create the discovery system, ending the state's experiment with judicial discovery rule-making.|$|E
5|$|During {{the wedding}} {{rehearsal}} the next day, Twilight barges in and decries Cadance as a fraud. Shining Armor is furious with Twilight and explains the apparent reasons for Cadance's behavior, and he, Princess Celestia {{and her friends}} <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> believe Twilight's claims, leaving a saddened Twilight alone with Cadance. When Twilight tries to apologize to her, Cadance reveals her evil side, casting a spell around Twilight which transports her underground to the caves beneath Canterlot.|$|E

5000|$|Jehovah's Witnesses {{came into}} {{conflict}} with the Nazi regime because they <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> salute Adolf Hitler with the traditional [...] "Heil Hitler" [...] salute, believing that it conflicted with their worship of God. Because <b>refusing</b> <b>to</b> salute Hitler was considered a crime, they were arrested, and their children attending school were expelled, detained and separated from their families. When Germany made military enlistment mandatory, they were persecuted because they <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> bear arms. Being politically neutral, they also <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> vote in the elections.|$|R
