5000|$|Physicochemical {{methods are}} based on the use of coagulants and {{adsorbents}} [...] Coagulants promote the coarsening and precipitation of fine-dispersed asphalt-resinous substances in oil. Adsorbents selectively absorb organic and inorganic compounds. These methods remove asphalt and resinous compounds, emulsified and dissolved water from oil. Adsorptive treatment with bleaching clays neutralizes free acid in acid-treated oil, unstable oxidized and sulphurized products as well as traces of sulphonic acid. In addition, clay treatment leads to higher resistance to oil oxidation at high temperatures and increased colour stability. This process is used in clay polishing plants for waste <b>oil</b> <b>re-refining</b> and transformer <b>oil</b> regeneration systems for the reclamation of old transformer oil to as-new condition.|$|R

40|$|Acid tars are waste {{residues}} of obsolete benzole refining, <b>oil</b> <b>re-refining</b> {{and white}} <b>oil</b> production processes. They are black, acidic, viscous semi-liquids comprising an extremely complex mixture of water, sulfuric acid {{and a large}} range of organic compounds. Acid tars were often dumped into excavations and existing holes in the ground together with various co-disposed materials without any treatment or engineered lining system leaving a legacy of acid tar lagoons. Acid tars may pose potential risks to {{human health and the}} environment because of their acidity, volatiles and other hazardous components. The major contamination pathways of acid tar lagoons are considered to be direct contact, gas emission, bulk tar migration offsite, and surface and ground water contamination. The leaching, weathering and migration behaviours of acid tars were investigated by carrying out a series of batch, cascade and flow cell tests. The results demonstrated that acid tars are capable of leaching Significant levels of contaminants if disturbed, while the leaching level is Significantly lower under simulated groundwater flow in a model soil. The time scale to leaching stabilization was of the order of months in the model soil and is expected to significantly exceed that in the natural environment. To support this work a nubmber of analytical methods for determining physical and chemical properties of acid tars had to be adapted from standard techniques. These modified techniques are described in detail together with recommendations for data integration and correlation of all analyses to form a better understanding of acid tars and their potential environmental impact.

In the study area, four trenches were constructed with a total volume of about 25, 000 m(3). They were almost totally filled with <b>re-refined</b> lubricating <b>oil</b> waste for approximately 25 years. No protection liners were used in the bottoms and laterals of the disposal trenches. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the potential of the resistivity and ground penetrating radar (GPR) methods in characterizing the contamination of this lubricant oil waste disposal area in Ribeiro Preto, SP, situated on the geological domain of the basalt spills of the Serra Geral Formation and the sandstones of the Botucatu Formation. Geophysical results were shown in 2 D profiles. The geophysical methods used enabled the identification of geophysical anomalies, which characterized the contamination produced by the trenches filled with lubricant oil waste. Conductive anomalies (smaller than 185 Omega m) immediately below the trenches suggest the action of bacteria in the hydrocarbons, as has been observed in several sites contaminated by hydrocarbons in previously reported cases in the literature. It was also possible to define the geometry of the trenches, as evidenced by the GPR method. Direct sampling (chemical analysis of the soil and the water in the monitoring well) confirmed the contamination. In the soil analysis, low concentrations of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were found, mainly naphthalene and phenanthrene. In the water samples, an analysis verified contamination of the groundwater by lead (Pb).

40|$|Over 2 × 10 ^ 11 {{kilograms}} of ammonia are produced globally per {{year by the}} Haber-Bosch process which combines molecular hydrogen and nitrogen to synthesize ammonia. Most is used for fertilizer and agriculture while the remaining is used for other purposes including industrial processes and explosives. Explosives used in the mining industry are commonly ammonium nitrate (43) -based. Excess ammonia and nitrate which can be dissolve into mine runoff water during blasting. Ammonia in mine and mineral wastewater can range from 20 - 110 mg/L. Ammonia is also present in several types of industrial wastewater such as caustic soda solutions used in the <b>oil</b> <b>re-refining</b> industry for removal of sulfur compounds from hydrocarbon streams. These waste streams are known as sulfidic caustic solution (SCS) or spent caustic. This thesis concerns the treatment of ammonia in two distinct types of industrial wastewaters {{in order to meet}} specific discharge criteria. The first industrial wastewater is a low ammonia concentration WWTP effluent (2 – 6 mg/L TAN as N) from a gold mine in Alaska. The other is an extremely high (6000 + mg/L TAN as N) concentration sulfidic caustic solution from <b>oil</b> <b>re-refining.</b> It was hypothesized that that for the low concentration of ammonia mine water, which had low turbidity and relatively simple water chemistry, advanced separation technologies such as ion-exchange, zeolite and membrane filtration, and electrocoagulation would work well compared to alternative treatment options. For the highly complex matrix oil refining caustic solution, it was expected that a straightforward commonly used ammonia removal technology, such as breakpoint chlorination would work very well. Laboratory column and batch testing using ion-exchange adsorption and chloramination were performed using actual waters contaminated with ammonia. For the low level mine water, several ion-exchange resins and zeolites were tested and compared based on the amount of water that could be treated per unit volume of resin. For the high concentration ammonia water linear regression relationships were determined which model the removal of ammonia {{as a function of the}} applied chlorine dose. For the mine water with low levels ammonia it was found that the number of bed volumes in which ammonia was removed with BRZ increased with increasing EBCT and decreasing potassium concentration. It was also found that temperature of a 5 °C did not significantly impact the removal. For removal of ammonia from SCS solution, applied chlorine doses needed to remove ammonia were measured between 2. 54 and 2. 01 [Cl₂]/[N]. In conclusion the results obtained from this investigation and implications described can be used to assist in the design of systems to remove of ammonia from wastewaters of similar characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Typically {{lubricants}} contain 90 % base oil(most often petroleum fractions,called mineral oils) {{and less}} than 10 % additives. Vegetable oils or synthetic liquids such as hydrogenated polyolefins,esters,silicones,fluorocarbons and many others are sometimes used as base oils. Solvent extraction is the method to eliminate the usage of high temperature or hydrogenation process in <b>re-refining</b> the base <b>oil</b> from spent lubricant oil. The main objective {{of this study is}} to recover the base oil from spent lubricants using solvent extraction method. Besides that,the effect of different solvent,the retention time and the characteristics of the extracted base oil are also determined. The raw materials that being used were spent lubricant oil and two types of solvents. These solvents are hexane mixed with potassium hydroxide in isopropyl alcohol and N-vinyl- 2 -pyrolidone (NNVP). During the experimental study, 200 ml of lubricant oil and 800 ml of solvents were mixed and leave to settle. After that,the mixture was filtered by vacuum pump to separate the sludge. Separation was continued using rotary evaporator to get the pure base oil. Then,the characteristics of the base oil for every mixture were analyzed. Results shows that the best solvent,is solvent 1 (Hexane + KOH + IPA) because it can recover more volume of base oil compare to solvent 2 (NNVP). Besides that,the best stirring time (retention time) for both solvent is 60 minutes. Solvent 1 is better than solvent 2 because it can recover higher volume of base oil compared to solvent 2 by 37 %.

(ULI) and Chemical Engineering Partners (CEP) have carried out a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to prepare nanostructured hydrotreating catalysts using atomic layer deposition (ALD) to exhibit superior performance for the re-refining of used lube oil. We investigated the upgrading of recycled lube oil by hydrogenation using commercial, synthetically-modified commercial catalysts, and synthesized catalysts. A down-flow (trickle bed) catalytic unit was used for the hydrogenation experiments. In addition to carrying out elemental analyses of the various feed and product fractions, characterization was undertaken using H{sup 1 } and C{sup 13 } NMR. Initially commercial were evaluated. Second these commercial catalysts were promoted with precious metals using atomic layer deposition (ALD). Performance improvements were observed that declined with catalyst aging.

40|$|Two novel {{processes}} {{based on}} ionic liquid methodology, including steps {{to recover the}} ionic liquids for reuse and recycle, are developed for the recovery of key value components from food wastes: namely glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) from seafood waste (scallop gut) and chitin-glucan complexes from cider yeast wastes. Both these components are high-added value materials in nutraceuticals and the chitin- glucan complexes are of particular interest because they are recovered from a vegetarian source. GAG recovery from scallop gut involves treatment of the wet waste with the ionic liquid, HBetNTf 2, in a low temperature (30 oC) process to separate the insoluble GAG mixture from other components of the waste, which are soluble. The important aspects of this process {{from the point of}} view of economic viability are: (i) it is a low-temperature process, (ii) the extraction of the unwanted components occurs quickly, (iii) the product GAGs are obtained in good yield, and (iv) all solvents used can be recovered. The recovery of chitin-glucan involves enzymatic pre-treatment of the cider yeast waste to give a digested pellet from which the complex can be recovered by treatment with the IL, BMIMCl. Two low temperature ionic liquid processes (TESA/TESAC and P 6, 6, 6, 14 Cl) for <b>re-refining</b> waste lubricant <b>oils</b> to recover base oils, of sufficient quality to be reused in lubricant applications, are also developed. The TESA/TESAC process is based on a reversible reaction from a solvent, TESA, in which the base oil is soluble to an ionic liquid, TESAC in which the base oil is insoluble. The conversion occurs when carbon dioxide is passed through the solvent and reversed by heating above 50 oC.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{re-refining}} of {{the used}} lube oils has gained worldwide {{a lot of}} attention due to the necessity for added environmental protection and increasingly stringent environmental legislation. One of the parameters determining the quality of the produced base oils is the composition of feedstock. Estimation of the chemical composition of the used oil collected from several European locations showed that the hydrocarbon structure of the motor oil is changed insignificantly during its operation and the major part of the changes is accounted for with depleted oil additives. In the lube <b>oil</b> <b>re-refining</b> industry silicon, coming mainly from antifoaming agents, is recognized to be a contaminant generating undesired solid deposits in various locations in the re-refining units. In this thesis, a particular attention was paid to the mechanism of solid product formation during the alkali treatment process of silicon-containing used lube oils. The transformations of a model siloxane, tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDS), were studied in a batch reactor at industrially relevant alkali treatment conditions (low temperature, short reaction time) using different alkali agents. The reaction mechanism involving solid alkali metal silanolates was proposed. The experimental data obtained demonstrated that the solids were dominant products at low temperature and short reaction time. The liquid products in the low temperature reactions were represented mainly by linear siloxanes. The prolongation of reaction time resulted in reduction of solids, whereas both temperature and time increase led to dominance of cyclic products in the reaction mixture. Experiments with the varied reaction time demonstrated that the concentration of cyclic trimer being the dominant {{in the beginning of the}} reaction diminished with time, whereas the cyclic tetramer tended to increase. Experiments with lower sodium hydroxide concentration showed the same effect. In addition, a decrease of alkali agent concentration in the initial reaction mixture accelerated TMDS transformation reactions resulting in solely liquid cyclic siloxanes yields. Comparison of sodium and potassium hydroxides applied as an alkali agent demonstrated that potassium hydroxide was more efficient, since the activation energy in KOH presence was almost 2 -fold lower than that for sodium hydroxide containing reaction mixture. Application of potassium hydroxide for TMDS transformation at 100 ° C with 3 hours reaction time resulted in 20 % decrease of solid yields compared to NaOH-containing mixture. Moreover, TMDS transformations in the presence of sodium silanolate applied as an alkali agent led to formation of only liquid products without formation of the undesired solids. On the basis of experimental data and the proposed reaction mechanism, a kinetic model was developed, which provided a satisfactory description of the experimental results. Suitability of the selected siloxane as a relevant model of industrial silicon-containing compounds was verified by investigation of the commercially available antifoam agent in base-catalyzed conditions...|$|R
