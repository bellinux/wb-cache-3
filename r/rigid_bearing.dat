40|$|The {{following}} general conclusions may {{be drawn}} from the ex-perimental work described: Inherently compensated thrust bearings can operate quite successfully when one of the pads is a compliant elastomer. Some consideration does need to be given to the possibility of pneumatic hammer instability. Compliant surface air lubricated bearings show an increased load capacity over equivalent rigid surface bearings at the same supply pressure. In some cases this increase was as much as 100 percent. There is a corresponding increase in flow rate as compared to a <b>rigid</b> <b>bearing</b> so that compliant bearings should be designed to run near their maximum load capacity where the clearance is small and the flows are much reduced. I t is possible to run the compliant bearings near this load limit because their stiffness is virtually constant. There is no rapid decrease in stiffness as the load limit is approached analogous to the <b>rigid</b> <b>bearing</b> case. Stiffness of the compliant bearings (at least for the inherently compensated type) is not much different from that of their <b>rigid</b> <b>bearing</b> equivalents. Extremely soft elastomers would probably show some reduction in relative stiffness. Bonding and machining of natural rubber is readily accom-plished. Acknowledgment...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{case of a}} {{rotating}} shaft with internal damping mounted either on elastic dissipative bearings or on infinitely <b>rigid</b> <b>bearings</b> with viscoelastic suspensions is investigated {{in order to obtain}} the stability region. A Euler–Bernoulli shaft model is adopted, in which the transverse shear effects are neglected and the effects of translational and rotatory inertia, gyroscopic moments, and internal viscous or hysteretic damping are taken into account. The hysteretic damping is incorporated with an equivalent viscous damping coefficient. Free motion analysis yields critical speeds and threshold speeds for each damping model in analytical form. In the case of elastic dissipative bearings, the present results are compared with the results of previous studies on finite element models. In the case of infinitely <b>rigid</b> <b>bearings</b> with viscoelastic suspensions, it is established that viscoelastic supports increase the stability of long shafts, thus compensating for the loss of efficiency which occurs with classical bearings. The instability criteria also show that the effect of the coupling which occured between rigid modes introducing external damping and shaft modes are almost more important than damping factor. Lastly, comparisons between viscous and hysteretic damping conditions lead to the conclusion that an appropriate material damping model is essential to be able to assess these instabilities...|$|R

Since the rub fault is highly nonlinear and transient, time-frequency representation (TFR) based on local mean decomposition (LMD) is extensively used for the study.

The present investigation advances the analysis and experimental validation of simple gas bearing configurations with static and dynamic force characteristics desirable in high-speed turbomachinery. Comprehensive experiments and analysis were conducted on a small rotor supported on three lobed hybrid (hydrostatic/hydrodynamic) <b>rigid</b> gas <b>bearings.</b> The <b>rigid</b> <b>bearings</b> are made up of preloaded 120 ? lobes with minute feed holes for external pressurization that are fed, for example, by bleed off from a turbocharger compressor outlet. The bearing nominal clearance and dimensionless preload are 66 microns and 0. 33, respectively. The test rotor, weighing 827 grams, integrates a DC motor and can achieve speeds as large as 100, 000 rpm. For various imbalance conditions, coast down tests from 60, 000 rpm characterize the rotor response on its bearings. As the supply pressure rises, the rotor response shows an increase in critical speed and a noticeable reduction in damping ratio. Threshold speeds of instability also increase with increasing supply pressures, and whirl frequency ratios range from nearly 50 % of rotor speed for a purely hydrodynamic condition to 25 % for a pressure supply five times ambient conditions. Bearing transmitted loads closely follow the rotor imbalance responses with large peak values while traversing the critical speeds. Similar imbalance response measurements were conducted with the test rotor supported on hybrid pressure dam gas bearings and on HyPad? tilting pad gas bearings. A linear rotordynamics model accounts for the rotor and gas hybrid bearings. A FE laminar flow model for hybrid gas bearing analysis predicts frequency dependent stiffness and damping force coefficients at the operating speeds and levels of feed pressure tested. The eigenvalue analysis forwards natural frequencies in agreement with the measurements. Estimated whirl frequency ratios are typically 50 % of rotor speed, thus predicting sub synchronous instabilities at lower rotor speeds than found experimentally when increasing the magnitude of feed pressurization...|$|R
40|$|PaperPg. 47 - 54. This paper {{describes}} how a serious field vibration problem {{on a high}} speed centrifugal compressor using tilting pad bearings was identified, following the introduction in the plant of simple methods of vibration recording and analysis, as being due to fractional frequency whirl at around 40 % of the running speed. A clear correlation was discovered between the vibration behavior and the bearing clearance. This correlation is shown to match closely the predictions of a theoretical study {{of the effect of}} bearing geometry (clearance and preload) on the stability of the particular rotor/bearing system, when a commonly used empirical criterion for stability is employed, namely that the logarithmic decrement of the system should be at least 0. 25 for instability to be avoided. The study shows that adequate stability could only be achieved in this particular system for bearings lying within a limited range of clearance and preload. Tight clearance, high preload bearings or loose clearance, negative preload bearings both give instability, and variations in bearing dimensions between nominally identical units are shown to be capable of moving the system from the stable to the unstable zone. The vibration problems have now been overcome by proper pad selection aimed at achieving an optimum bearing clearance and preload of about 7 mils and 0. 15, respectively. The marginal stability in this machine is associated {{with the fact that the}} shaft first critical speed is about 44 % of the full running speed, while machines of the same type, but with stiffer shafts giving a critical speed of about 55 % of the running speed, have been free of instability problems.

The role of discretisation and surface displacement interpolation errors are investigated under steady load conditions. Under dynamic load, ring, housing and previous experimental works are compared.

Correlation of dynamic film-thickness measurements with the elastic solutions are generally improved over rigid predictions. With regard to minimum film thickness, inertial 'ring' solutions gave similar values to housing solutions with and without gas loading; this facilitates non-dimensionalisation. Two separate minimum-film regime were subsequently identified: one in the con-rod neck and a second, at higher load, in the cap. The first condition sees thicker minimum films than the rigid bearing; the second, thinner films with an increased sensitivity to load.

Here, in this project we are going to design bearings required to support the shaft which runs {{at a very high}} speed. Current project concentrate to analyse the load bearing capacity of the thrust bearings. In the analysis Reynolds’ Equation is used to know the pressure distribution of these bearings. The Reynolds’ Equation is solved by using FINITE DIFFERENCE METHOD and using many assumptions to know the pressure distribution of the thrust bearings.

In high speed turbomachinery elements, conventional bearings can’t be used since {{at such a}} high speed (50000 - 80000) rpm these bearings get worn and thus they fail. In this project the analysis of a compliant bearing, which has bump foils to enhance the load carrying capacity, has been done. The thin air film between the rotating shaft and the bearing creates the pressure to support the load. Reynolds Equation was first devised for the given compliance system. Due to its nonlinear nature iterative methods are required to solve it. For calculating the pressure distribution and hence the load carrying capacity of the bearings Finite Difference Approximations were used and a unique method, method of quadratic equations was used to find out several parameters.

The proposed method has been employed to evaluate the indentation damage generated {{in the presence of}} bending deformation, resulting from the contact between a thin plate and a rigid sphere. For this purpose, the 3 D Digital Image Correlation (3 D-DIC) technique has been adopted to quantify the out of plane displacements at the back face of the plate. Tests were conducted using aluminum thin plates and a <b>rigid</b> <b>bearing</b> sphere to evaluate the influence of the thickness and the material behavior during contact. Information provided by the 3 D-DIC technique has been employed to perform an indirect measurement of the contact area during the loading and unloading path of the test. A symmetrical distribution in the contact damage region due to the symmetry of the indenter was always observed. In the case of aluminum plates, the presence of a high level of plasticity caused shearing deformation as the load increased. Results show the full-field contact damage area for different plates’ thicknesses at different loads. The contact damage region was bigger when the thickness of the specimen increased, and therefore, bending deformation was reduced.

40|$|The Oil-Free Turbomachinery Program at the NASA Glenn Research {{center is}} {{committed}} to, revolutionary improvements in performance, efficiency {{and reliability of}} turbomachinery propulsion systems. One of the key breakthroughs by which this goal is being achieved is the maturation of air lubricated foil bearing technology. Through experimental testing, foil bearings have demonstrated a variety of exceptional qualities that show them to {{have an important role}} in the future of rotordynamic lubrication. Most of the work done with foil bearings thus far has considered ambient air at atmospheric pressure as the working fluid or lubricating fluid in the bearing. However, special applications of oil-free technology require the use of air at non- standard ambient conditions or completely different working fluids altogether. The NASA Jupiter Icy Moon Orbiter program presents power generation needs far beyond that of any previous space exploration effort. The proposed spacecraft will require significant power generation to provide the propulsion necessary to reach the moons of Jupiter and navigate between them. Once there, extensive scientific research will be conducted that will also present significant power requirements. Such extreme needs require exploring a new method for power generation in space. A proposed solution involves a Brayton cycle nuclear fission reactor. The nature of this application requires reliable performance of all reactor components for many years of operation under demanding conditions. This includes the bearings which will be operating with an alternative working fluid that is a combination of Helium and Xenon gases commonly known as HeXe. This fluid has transport and thermal properties that vary significantly from that of air and the effect of these property differences on bearing performance must be considered. One of the most promising applications of oil-free technology is in aircraft turbine engines. Eliminating the oil supply systems from aircraft engines will lead to significant weight and maintenance reduction. In such applications, the lubricating fluid will be high altitude air. This air will be at much lower pressure than that at sea level. Again this property change will result in a change in bearing performance, and analysis is required to quantify this effect. The study of these alternate working fluid properties will be conducted in two ways: analytically and experimentally. Analytical research will include the use of a mathematical code that can predict film thickness profiles for various ambient conditions. Estimations of load capacity can be made based upon the film thickness trends. These values will then be compared to those obtained from classical <b>rigid</b> <b>bearing</b> analysis.

40|$|For {{dynamical}} systems having several {{degrees of}} freedom, motion {{in one direction}} can induce motion in the other and/or vice versa. This {{means that there is}} a certain coupling between these two motions. Coupling can in some cases be a source of instability that causes self-excited vibrations in rotating machinery. In modeling hydropower rotors, couplings other than those that are the result of gyroscopic effect are normally not considered. This is due to the complexity of the reasons for coupling which mainly depends on machinery hardware, for example, the bearing's design (type) and the asymmetry in machine components. In this thesis, couplings due to bearings and gyroscopic effect were studied analytically and numerically. The performed studies include mathematical modeling and numerical simulation of some cases examples. Plain cylindrical hydrodynamic journal-bearing was modeled as a fluid-film lubrication separating the rotor from the stationary <b>rigid</b> <b>bearing.</b> Both nonlinear and linear fluid-film forces were considered in the analyses. In case of tilting-pad bearings, the fluid-film and the flexible support structures were modeled as linear stiffness while neglecting the pads inertia and the fluid-film damping. Plain cylindrical hydrodynamic journal-bearings provide high damping to the rotor system, but they also cross couple the rotor translational motions. Cross coupling is the main source of oil induced instability; therefore, the rotor speed should not exceed the speed at which oil-induced instability occurs. The inherent nonlinearity of plain cylindrical hydrodynamic journalbearings becomes strong for eccentricities greater than 60 % of the bearing clearance, where most existing linear models are not able to accurately predict the rotor trajectory. Strong nonlinearities together with cross coupling are the source of complex dynamics in fluid-film journal bearings. Paper A concerns analysis of the dynamic behavior of a rigid symmetric rotor that is supported by two identical finite-length journal bearings at high eccentricities. The journal bearing impedance descriptions method, a method that is valid for all bearing aspect ratios and all eccentricities, was used to evaluate linear analysis of the rotor steady-state imbalance response. The results show that linear bearing models derived from the nonlinear impedance descriptions of the Moes-cavitated (π - film) finite-length bearing can predict the steady-state imbalance response of a rigid symmetric rotor that is supported by two identical journal-bearings at high eccentricities. This is, however, only the case when operating conditions are below the threshold speed of instability and when the system has period one solutions. The error increases in the vicinity of resonance speed. The gyroscopic coupling effect on oil whirl instability and journal trajectories was analyzed in Paper B. The same linear and nonlinear bearing models from Paper A were reused here, and the flexible non-symmetric rotor that is supported by two identical finite-length journal-bearings was modelled by finite element method. The results show that the instability threshold of a rigid non-symmetric rotor-bearing system depends on the low stability characteristics of the less loaded bearing. However, when shaft flexibility and the gyroscopic coupling effect are taken into account, the instability threshold increases. The gyroscopic coupling effect not only increases the instability threshold, the magnitude of journal trajectories also significantly increases. This is normally not a preferable condition since high vibrations will induce heat and stress in babbited bearings. Rotor imbalance has a positive effect on flexible non-symmetric rotors; it enables the rotor system to be operated beyond its threshold speed of instability with reduced vibration amplitudes. Tilting pad journal-bearing has low cross coupling between the rotor's translational (lateral) motions. Vertical rotors and shafts designed to transmit thrust are equipped with thrust bearing. Paper C focuses particularly on modelling and analyzing the thrust bearing's dynamic influence on vertical rotors. A case study on an existing vertical hydroturbogenerator is presented. Results show that the tilting-pad thrust bearing influences the system's second and third natural frequencies. But in this case, the system's first natural frequencies were not influenced by the thrust bearing. The rotor second natural lateral vibration mode shows that the rotor system without thrust bearing has larger vibration amplitude at the exciter location than the rotor system with thrust bearing. The thrust bearing stiffening effect at rotor second natural bending mode has also resulted in reduced vibration amplitude of the rotor at the exciter location. The main observation is that the thrust bearing generates a stiffening moment which is directly proportional to the rotor's angular motions at thrust bearing location. The results obtained from the conducted studies are useful during the design process for new hydropower rotor-bearing systems and for maintaining old existing hydropower plants. The developed models can serve as a simulation tool during design modifications or during analysis of failures. Due to the large scale of real hydropower units, simulations are useful because they are more time and cost-efficient than running full-scale experiments. They also facilitate analysis {{of a large number of}} operating conditions and design modifications.

It is shown that, depending on the angular momentum magnitude, either static states of the system or two motions corresponding to rotations of the bearing body about the axis of the greatest moment of inertia are asymptotically stable, while all the other stationary motions are unstable in the sense of Lyapunov...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{problem that the}} bearing rigidity theory studies is to determine when a framework can be uniquely determined up to a translation and a scaling factor by its inter-neighbor bearings. While many previous works focused on the bearing rigidity of two-dimensional frameworks, a first contribution {{of this paper is}} to extend these results to arbitrary dimensions. It is shown that a framework in an arbitrary dimension can be uniquely determined up to a translation and a scaling factor by the bearings if and only if the framework is infinitesimally <b>bearing</b> <b>rigid.</b> In this paper, the proposed bearing rigidity theory is further applied to the bearing-only formation stabilization problem where the target formation is defined by inter-neighbor bearings and the feedback control uses only bearing measurements. Nonlinear distributed bearing-only formation control laws are proposed for the cases with and without a global orientation. It is proved that the control laws can almost globally stabilize infinitesimally <b>bearing</b> <b>rigid</b> formations. Numerical simulations are provided to support the analysis.

60|$|One of {{them had}} the <b>rigid</b> {{precision}} of <b>bearing</b> which denotes military training: {{he was young and}} slight of build, with unruly dark hair fluttering round the temples from beneath his white sugar-loaf hat, and escaping the trammels of the neatly-tied black silk bow at the nape of the neck; he held himself very erect and rode his horse on the curb, the reins gathered tightly in one gloved hand, and that hand held closely and almost immovably against his chest.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of a two-plane automatic bal-ancing device for <b>rigid</b> rotors. Ball <b>bearings,</b> which are free to travel around a race, are used to eliminate im-balance due to shaft eccentricity or misalignment. Here we consider the effect that asymmetries such as support anisotropy have on the auto-balancing process. Stabil-ity diagrams show that the device is robust to the con-sidered asymmetries when the rotation speeds are su-percritical and the mass imbalance is small.

50|$|Castor {{wind-off}} at {{the front}} during braking is handled by McLaren's proprietary Ground Plane Shear Centre - the wishbones on either side in the subframe are fixed in <b>rigid</b> plane <b>bearings</b> and connected to the body by four independent bushes which are 25 times more stiff radially than axially. This solution provides for a castor wind-off measured to 1.02 degrees per g of braking deceleration. Compare the Honda NSX at 2.91 degrees per g, the Porsche 928 S at 3.60 degrees per g and the Jaguar XJ6 at 4.30 degrees per g respectively. The difference in toe and camber values are also of very small under lateral force application. Inclined Shear Axis is used {{at the rear of}} the machine provides measurements of 0.04 degrees per g of change in toe-in under braking and 0.08 degrees per g of toe-out under traction.|$|R
