5|$|Post {{is where}} {{mainstream}} music could have gone. While modern chart music hasn't gone there entirely, Björk {{opened up the}} space for a more enigmatic and less readily labelled style; she undoubtedly helped broaden the playing field. Modern music still, regularly, finds itself, like a dinosaur stuck in a tar pit, going nowhere and heading for extinction. Yet, there are pockets of air that artists like Björk - and those before her like Kate Bush - have pumped full of oxygen for the next generations of rare, raw and intense female talents - the Lordes and Sias of the world - to breath. In this way, the album title is a misnomer. Björk was a precursor rather than a late comer, less post than pre. Post stands today as {{a body of work}} that still informs the more marginal artistic fringes of modern music and <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> how narrow and staid our world would be without outliers like Björk.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of 4 consists of mid-tempo pieces, {{but unlike the}} filler that might have occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in this realm. Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while {{not be easy to}} grind to, still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> that a party is not only meant for dancing. It is a place where you go to enjoy the company of others and oftentimes, that involves real human conversation and interaction. Echoing this sentiment, André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast. 'Party' like much of 4, is a conversation, and André 3000 wants to be heard.|$|E
25|$|The two rice stalks and {{the farmer}} {{represents}} agriculture that <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> {{that the city}} was once a farming community before evolving into an urbanized city. The globe symbolizes the city's global competitiveness while the green leaf represents the city's environmental advocacy.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding {{the purpose}} of art, O'Grady has observed: [...] "I think art’s first goal is to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> that we are human, {{whatever}} that is. I suppose the politics in my art could be to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> {{that we are all}} human." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{frequently}} injects {{elements that}} <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> of his Andean heritage. For example, this Crucifix has three coca leaves below {{the heart of}} Christ. He says he put them there to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> that coca leaves (not cocaine) {{play an important role}} in Indigenous Andean cultures.|$|R

25|$|We loyally went {{on using}} the script {{inherited}} from our forefathers. We clung tenaciously to our runes, {{longer than any}} other nation. And thus our incomparable wealth of runic inscriptions also <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> of how incomparably slow we were - slow and as if reluctant - to join {{the company of the}} civilised nations of Europe.|$|E
25|$|Hearst {{promoted}} {{writers and}} cartoonists {{despite the lack}} of any apparent demand for them by his readers. The press critic A. J. Liebling <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> how many of Hearst's stars would not have been deemed employable elsewhere. One Hearst favorite, George Herriman, was the inventor of the dizzy comic strip Krazy Kat; not especially popular with either readers or editors {{at the time of its}} initial publication, it is now considered by many to be a classic, a belief once held only by Hearst himself.|$|E
25|$|But, {{whatever}} {{might be}} Shaftesbury's speculative opinions or his mode of expressing them, all witnesses bear {{testimony to the}} elevation and purity {{of his life and}} aims. As an earnest student, and ardent lover of liberty, an enthusiast in the cause of virtue, and a man of unblemished life and untiring beneficence, Shaftesbury probably had no superior in his generation. His character and pursuits are the more remarkable, considering the rank of life in which he was born and the circumstances under which he was brought up. In many respects he <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> of the Stoic philosopher and Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, whose works he studied with avidity, and whose influence is stamped upon his own productions.|$|E

25|$|The {{decline of}} the Roman Empire brought {{sweeping}} changes to Gaul, as the region was invaded by Germanic tribes from the north including the Visigoths, Burgundians and the Franks, none of whom were familiar with wine. The invaders set up kingdoms in Aquitaine, Burgundy and Île-de-France. By the time that Charlemagne established his kingdom in the late 8th century, power in France was polarised between south and north: unlike the Mediterranean south, where grapes were easy to cultivate and wine was plentiful, the more viticulturally challenged regions of the north saw wine as a luxury item and a symbol of status. The influence of the Christian Church (which had been largely permeated throughout the region since the 6th century) also enhanced the image of wine in France as it became {{an integral part of}} the sacrament of the Eucharist, though the discovery of a second-third century silver wine dipper as part of temple votive deposit at Pont-de-Leyris <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> that wine was an integral part of pagan rites as well.|$|E
25|$|Rabbinic {{literature}} also records {{a tradition}} of eating cheese and other dairy products during Hanukkah. This custom, as mentioned above, commemorates the heroism of Judith during the Babylonian captivity of the Jews and <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> that women also {{played an important role}} in the events of Hanukkah. The deuterocanonical book of Judith (Yehudit or Yehudis in Hebrew), which is not part of the Tanakh, records that Holofernes, an Assyrian general, had surrounded the village of Bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer Judea. After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews was cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps and pretended to surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. She went back to his tent with him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her (the beheading of Holofernes by Judith has historically been a popular theme in art). When Holofernes' soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated.|$|E

500|$|While blessing the badnjak, some priests chant the {{following}} prayer: [...] "O Lord Jesus Christ, our God, who did plant the Tree of Life in paradise {{so that it}} might bestow upon us eternal blessedness, bless also now this tree which {{is a symbol of}} Thy cross and the Tree of Life in paradise, and which <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> of Thy holy birth and of the logs which the shepherds of Bethlehem kindled to warm themselves when they came to worship Thee, the divine infant, and thereby prefigured Thy salvation-bearing cross." ...|$|E
500|$|African American Studies scholar James Smethurst {{was more}} critical, writing in The Boston Globe that [...] "this {{catalogue}} of the nadir {{is one of the}} book's weaknesses, since it sometimes departs from its account of peonage without much transition. Paying more attention to the considerable presence of involuntary servitude in African-American literature and intellectual history, reaching back to Charles Chesnutt and Paul Laurence Dunbar, would have helped". However, he concludes that [...] "the book vividly and engagingly recalls the horror and sheer magnitude of such neo-slavery and <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> how long after emancipation such practices persisted." ...|$|E

500|$|On its exhibition, The Combat was {{generally}} highly praised by critics for its technical excellence, its {{combination of the}} Venetian and English styles of painting, and as an indication that Etty was moving away from nudity and towards history painting.
