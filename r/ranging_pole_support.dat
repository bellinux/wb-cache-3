40|$|A land {{surveyor}} makes accurate measurements using knowledge, physical dexterity, and properly calibrated equipment. All measurements contain errors, but the professional surveyor is {{mindful of the}} various sources and consciously works to minimize them based on experience and informed decision making. One such error source is the level vial, a standard component of numerous survey instruments and accessories. This paper derives expected miscentering error from a circular sprit level with an example using a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) <b>range</b> <b>pole</b> as commonly used for real-time kinematic positioning. We demonstrate that when {{the length of a}} 2 -m, 40 min: 2 mm, GNSS <b>range</b> <b>pole</b> is well known (standard deviation of <b>range</b> <b>pole</b> length = ± 1 mm) and the observer has a decent centering ability (standard deviation of vial centering ability = ± 1 mm), the most probable error magnitude for a single observation is 8 mm...|$|R

50|$|Umbrellas and parasols are {{primarily}} hand-held portable devices sized for personal use. The largest hand-portable umbrellas are golf umbrellas. Umbrellas {{can be divided}} into two categories: fully collapsible umbrellas, in which the metal <b>pole</b> <b>supporting</b> the canopy retracts, making the umbrella small enough to fit in a handbag; and non-collapsible umbrellas, in which the <b>support</b> <b>pole</b> cannot retract and only the canopy can be collapsed. Another distinction can be made between manually operated umbrellas and spring-loaded automatic umbrellas which spring open at the press of a button.|$|R

40|$|Decision Support System {{is playing}} an {{important}} role in computer science, technology and engineering. Intelligent decision-making is one of the current hotspots in the decision support system research. Intelligent decision-making methods and algorithms {{are one of the most}} important basics and key cores in intelligent information processing, intelligent pervasive computing and so on. In this paper, conduct the research to two kinds of indefinite multi-objective decision making question: the indefinite sector and the indefinite language. (1) In view of multi-attribute decision-making under linguistic setting, propose one new decision method. Firstly construct a <b>range</b> <b>pole</b> plan and introduce the policy-maker risk-preference weight. Then with three tuples (Limit low similarity, Risk degree, Risk-preference value) reflect the risk-degree existing in the decision-making process. At last, construct the risk-weighted similarity measure operator (RWSMO) to measure the risk balance similarity's size between each of decision schemes and the <b>range</b> <b>pole</b> plan. (2) In view of multi-attribute decision-making under the indefinite sector, propose one new decision method based on the multiple-valued intuitive fuzzy sets. </span...|$|R
