2500|$|According to {{musician}} Ronan Nolan, {{former editor}} of Irish Music magazine, the bodhrán evolved in the mid-19th century from the tambourine, which can be heard on some Irish music <b>recordings</b> <b>dating</b> <b>back</b> to the 1920s and viewed in a pre-Famine painting. However, in remote parts of the south-west, the [...] "poor man's tambourine" [...] – made from farm implements and without the cymbals – was in popular use among mummers, or wren boys. A large oil painting on canvas by Daniel Maclise (1806–1870) depicts a large Halloween house party in which a bodhrán features clearly. That painting, produced c. 1842, shows a flautist accompanied by a tambourine player who, in an Arabic style in contrast to standard bodhrán technique, used his fingers rather than a tipper. It is known that by the early 20th century, home-made frame drums were constructed using willow branches as frames, leather as drumheads, and pennies as jingles. In photographs from the 1940s and videos from the 1950s, jingles remained part of the bodhrán construction like a tambourine, yet were played with cipín, also known in English as [...] "tipper".|$|R

5000|$|The {{identity}} of the first rock and roll record {{is one of the}} most enduring subjects of debate among rock historians. Various <b>recordings</b> <b>dating</b> <b>back</b> to the 1940s and 1950s have been cited as the first rock and roll record. A number of sources have considered the first to be [...] "Rocket 88", which was recorded in 1951 by Ike Turner and his band, but credited to his saxophonist and the song's vocalist Jackie Brenston. According to The Boston Globes Joan Anderman, most rock historians cite it as the first, while The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll and the website of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame said that it is [...] "frequently cited" [...] and [...] "widely considered the first", respectively. People in the music industry have also called it the first, among several others. [...] "Rocket 88" [...] is cited for its forceful backbeat and unrefined, distorted electric guitar. By contrast, writer and musician Michael Campbell wrote that, [...] "from our perspective," [...] it was not the first rock and roll record because it had a shuffle beat rather than the rock rhythm originally characteristic in Chuck Berry's and Little Richard's songs, although he added that [...] "Rocket 88" [...] had basic characteristics of rock music such as the emphasis on guitar and distortion. Its characterization as a rock and roll or rhythm and blues song continues to be debated. Nigel Williamson questions whether it was really an R&B song [...] "with an unusually fast, bottom-heavy eight-to-the bar boogie rhythm and a great lyric about cars, booze and women".|$|R
