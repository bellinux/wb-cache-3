30|$|Although the NCAC was {{determining}} {{decisions on}} the Accreditation status of childcare services since 1993 {{it was not until}} 1997 that the federal government approved the establishment of a process, under the Child Care Act 1972 – 1973, PART V — ADVISORY COMMITTEES, s 16 being, the Accreditations Decisions Review Committee (ADRC). With such a process in place, services who considered an unjust/unfair assessment of their practices had been made and the ensuing Accreditation Decision made by NCAC not reflective of the services practices, now had the right to be heard. From ADRC’s creation in 1997 until 1998, this important review committee was located within the accrediting body (NCAC) as a separate committee with recommendatory powers. However, it became clear that if a review committee was to provide an objective <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accreditation</b> Decisions of NCAC and promote fairness and equity in the administration of the child care quality assurance system, it needed to be a separate and independent body. Consequently, in 1998 the commonwealth government revised the Terms of Reference of ADRC to provide ADRC the status of an independent review committee with recommendatory powers. As with recommendatory powers (Douglas, 2006), ADRC could not bind the decision making body (NCAC) to reconsider its accreditation decision in the light of its recommendations. The right to determinative decision-making powers, like the powers provided to the review process in the Council of Accreditation for Children and Families (COA) in US (Frisino, 2002), still eluded ADRC.|$|E

30|$|Not {{withstanding}} its {{inability to}} posses such powers as the COA, {{the establishment of an}} independent committee to <b>review</b> the <b>Accreditation</b> Decisions <b>of</b> the NCAC could have been considered to be more than promoting fairness and equity in the administration of a child care quality assurance system. Such a move placed ADRC on equal footing with NCAC, that is, the decision reviewer on the same level as the decision maker.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and analyze research into accreditation and accreditation processes. Data sources: A multi-method, systematic <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the <b>accreditation</b> literature was conducted from March to May 2007. The search identified articles researching accreditation. Discussion or commentary pieces were excluded. Study selection: From the initial identification of over 3000 abstracts, 66 studies that met the search criteria by empirically examining accreditation were selected. Data extraction and results of data synthesis: The 66 studies were retrieved and analyzed. The results, examining the impact or effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>accreditation,</b> were classified into 10 categories: professions' attitudes to accreditation, promote change, organizational impact, financial impact, quality measures, program assessment, consumer views or patient satisfaction, public disclosure, professional development and surveyor issues. Results: The analysis reveals a complex picture. In two categories consistent findings were recorded: promote change and professional development. Inconsistent findings were identified in five categories: professions' attitudes to accreditation, organizational impact, financial impact, quality measures and program assessment. The remaining three categories - consumer views or patient satisfaction, public disclosure and surveyor issues - did not have sufficient studies to draw any conclusion. The search identified a number of national health care accreditation organizations engaged in research activities.

40|$|In {{engineering}} education, the <b>accreditation</b> {{and assessment}} <b>of</b> academic programmes is vital {{in order to}} maintain the quality and the status of engineering graduates, and hence the technical workforce. Results of a survey of the relevant literature and observations indicate that various accreditation models have been developed regionally, as well as internationally but most of these models seem to be non-uniform, too complex, non-transparent and, moreover, non-precise. This leads to confusion and growing concerns about the mutual recognition and global mobility of the engineering profession. As a result, there is an urgent need for a systematic global model <b>of</b> engineering <b>accreditation</b> that can be used to assess global professional skills and attributes of engineering graduates. The aim of the current paper is to present a brief <b>review</b> <b>of</b> existing <b>accreditation</b> systems implemented in engineering education worldwide as well as to describe the methodology for developing a global accreditation model in engineering education.

30|$|Standards {{of quality}} can {{influence}} the way childcare is both implemented and viewed by families. In Australia, childcare services are required {{to participate in a}} process <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> in order for their families to be eligible to receive Commonwealth government Childcare Benefit payments that assist them with the cost <b>of</b> childcare. The <b>accreditation</b> process determines if the practices the services implement are in line with agreed elements of quality care practices and such practices protect the rights of the child. Of equal interest however, are the strategies the nation has in place to protect the child care service itself from potential unfair/unjust assessment of its practices. The concepts of procedural fairness, if the service considers an unjust/unfair assessment of their practices has been made, are rightly addressed in the Australian Child Care Accreditation System (CCAS). This final step within CCAS is one which is quite unique in the international context. This paper addresses the framework, implementation, and issues that need to be faced in delivering a fair and just <b>review</b> <b>of</b> a service’s <b>Accreditation</b> Decision, along with the role the review process plays in the nation’s accreditation system for childcare. Data from review applications submitted by services over a nine year period was analysed to determine if childcare services who considered the assessment of their practices was unfair/unjust, was supported following an evidence based <b>review</b> <b>of</b> its practices by the review agency. Conclusions highlighted a range of issues such as assessment practices, subjectivity of assessment and relevance of assessment to context that require further research. Such findings can be utilized to inform policy development on the ongoing development <b>of</b> holistic <b>accreditation</b> systems internationally.|$|R

Stimulating and engaging staff to participate in accreditation processes is a considerable challenge. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore the experiences of health executives, managers and frontline clinicians who participated in organizational accreditation processes: what motivated them to engage, and what benefits accrued? Design/participants: The setting was a large public teaching hospital undergoing a planned <b>review</b> <b>of</b> its <b>accreditation</b> status. A research protocol was employed to conduct semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 30 staff with varied organizational roles, from different professions, to discuss their involvement in <b>accreditation.</b> Thematic analysis <b>of</b> the data was undertaken. Results: The analysis identified three categories, each with sub-themes: accreditation response (reactions to accreditation and the value of surveys); survey issues (participation in the survey, learning through interactions and constraints) and documentation issues (self-assessment report, survey report and recommendations). Participants' occupational role focuses their attention to prioritize aspects <b>of</b> the <b>accreditation</b> process. Their motivations to participate and the benefits that accrue to them can be positively self-reinforcing. Participants have a desire to engage collaboratively with colleagues to learn and validate their efforts to improve. Conclusion: Participation in the accreditation process promoted a quality and safety culture that crossed organizational boundaries. The insights into worker motivation can be applied to engage staff to promote learning, overcome organizational boundaries and improve services. The findings can be applied to enhance involvement with accreditation and, more broadly, to other quality and safety activities. 7 page(s...|$|R

Even though law enforcement accreditation has existed for more than a decade, many law enforcement agencies have chosen not {{to be a part of}} the process. The reasons for this reluctance or refusal are many. Accreditation, whether for educational institutions, hospitals, or law enforcement agencies provides an avenue for this increased functionality and professionalism through compliance to a set of standards that have been developed by professionals within and without the field. While the number of accredited law enforcement agencies has continually increased over a ten year period, the number remains small compared to the more than twenty thousand law enforcement agencies nationwide. To help promote a better understanding <b>of</b> the <b>accreditation</b> process, this study was undertaken to provide answers to the following questions: 1) To what degree are the accreditation standards realistic, applicable, and obtainable? 2) To what degree are the benefits <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> worth the effort and costs involved? and 3) To what degree would those agencies that are either accredited or in the accreditation process recommend non-participating agencies to enter the process? A <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the literature suggests that little has been done in the way of empirical research to provide interested law enforcement agencies with data with which to make an informed decision concerning law enforcement accreditation. To accomplish the goals of this study, 582 law enforcement agencies who were either accredited or working towards accreditation were mailed a questionnaire that was to be completed and returned to the researcher. Results indicated that most agencies felt they were more professional due to their participation in the process but that some changes in the accreditation standards and process would be beneficial. The results also revealed that many agencies incurred unexpected costs related to the accreditation process.

40|$|Objective: To <b>review</b> the {{background}} <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> in healthcare. We examine the National Safety Quality Health Service (NSQHS) standards {{development and the}} perceptions {{of some of the}} NSQHS accredited accreditation providers in Australia. Design: An exploratory qualitative study in which the researchers use interviews and content comparison analysis to examine the Australian NSQHS standards (the Standards), the approving accrediting agencies and the perceived impact of the changes on the healthcare system. Setting: The researchers focus on providers’ accreditation products and services, and how the Standards will impact on the Australian Healthcare system. Australia is not alone in undergoing reforms in accreditation and performance in healthcare. Other countries and international organisations have recently revised and renewed their interest in how healthcare systems perform. Outcome: This has {{led to the development of}} revised standards; quality and safety review frameworks; performance indicators for monitoring, assessing and managing healthcare systems to achieve effectiveness, equity, efficiency and quality. Measures: Analysis of qualitative data using the constant comparison method. Findings: Five major themes are found from in-depth interviews with accreditation program providers: the multiple levels <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> that are offered; the importance of assessor recruitment and training; the aspiration of service excellence; improved processes; and the importance of value versus price to those who are accredited by the participants of this study.

40|$|Abstract: Interprofessional {{healthcare}} {{was introduced}} {{as a concept}} to enhance quality of patient care. Its application involves a team of different healthcare professionals working together to deliver excellence in patient care. This is presupposed by an understanding of one another’s professions {{and its relation to}} best practices in patient care. Through the early adoption of this concept, enhanced interprofessional communication and patient education techniques have been developed and have been proven to show an enhanced quality of patient care. Concurrently, there has been an explosion of new health professional schools in university settings that have the potential to better promote inter professional education through innovative and creative ideas. Rightly so, interprofessional healthcare perspectives are serving as a catalyst for health professional education. The benefits to inter professional education are unarguable. Professions and education administrators must evaluate its current accreditation standards to ensure that they best prepare health professional students to meet societal demands. Thus far, several health professional accreditation associations have added or revised educational standards to include the need for interprofessional education. This paper will provide a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the recent changes in accreditation standards across health professions {{as it relates to the}} inclusion of interprofessional education.
