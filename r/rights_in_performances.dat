40|$|International audienceIn {{terrestrial}} animals with rigid protective structures, {{the ability to}} upright after being overturned {{can make the difference}} between life and death, especially in suboptimal thermal conditions or in the presence of predators. This trait is assumed to be under strong selection. Different factors can influence righting ability, body dimensions and body mass for instance. As these morphological traits diverge among populations, inter-population variability <b>in</b> <b>righting</b> ability is expected. Previous studies on tortoises were performed within single populations and they usually focused on juveniles raised in captivity, precluding an assessment of the inter-population variability in a natural (realistic) context. In the current study, we quantified the <b>righting</b> <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> four populations of free-ranging adult tortoises. We found strong differences <b>in</b> <b>righting</b> success among populations and between genders, suggesting possible adaptations to local conditions. For instance, the topography (e. g. slopes) of each study site varied markedly. On average, males were more successful <b>in</b> <b>righting</b> themselves than females.

Articles 139 and 140 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong state that protection {{should be given to}} intellectual property rights in Hong Kong. It comes as no surprise then that Hong Kong has a suite of legislation dealing with each of the major intellectual property regimes, namely copyright, trade marks, patents and registered designs. The copyright regime is enshrined in the Copyright Ordinance (Cap 528) and like most other jurisdictions, registration is not a pre-requisite for obtaining copyright protection, nor are there any formalities that need to be complied with before copyright protection is afforded to a work in Hong Kong. The Copyright Ordinance gives protection {{to a wide range of}} creative outputs including literary works (including computer programs), dramatic, musical and artistic works, sound recordings, films, broadcasts, published editions as well as <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>performances</b> and moral rights.

5000|$|Currently {{there is}} no proper private copy {{exception}} in the United Kingdom, {{there is only a}} narrow exception regarding broadcast time-shifting (sec. 70(1) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988). On 1.6.2014 the UK implemented art. 5(2)b of the Infosoc Directive by introducing a limited private copy exception. In fact, the Copyright and <b>Rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>Performance</b> (Personal Copies for Private Use) Regulations 2014 provided an exception limited to the personal use, to the owners of a personal copy and with the exclusion of the even indirectly commercial uses. No compensation was provided. Indeed, the Government took the stand that [...] "levies or other compensation are neither required nor desirable {{in the context of a}} narrow provision that causes minimal harm. Levies are an unnecessary and inefficient tax on consumers. They are unfair to consumers in that they are payable regardless of the use to which a levied device (for example a hard disk) is put and regardless of whether a user has already paid for the copies they store on a device. Furthermore, particularly in the current economic climate, it is not right to extract more money from the pockets of hard pressed consumers.”. Notwithstanding the long process of consultation and all the empirical evidence gathered, the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA), the Musicians’ Union, and UK Music still found that this narrow exception harmed their interests; therefore, they brought an application for judicial review and surprisingly succeeded. More precisely, on 19.6.2015 the High Court of Justice ruled only one issue (the fourth) in favour of the claimants, that was [...] "The submission that the decision was flawed because the evidence relied upon to justify the conclusion about harm was inadequate/manifestly inadequate: This submission focuses upon the Secretary of State’s conclusion that the exception would lead to minimal or zero harm when the evidence relied upon does not support that conclusion”.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground: Assessment of <b>right</b> {{ventricular}} <b>performance</b> <b>in</b> the perioperative {{period is}} difficult {{because there is no}} generally accepted method of measuring right ventricular volume. We set out to determine whether conductance technology could provide a valuable technique for the investigation of intraoperative right ventricular function. Methods and results: Three validating studies were performed in 25 patients undergoing routine coronary revascularization. Study 1 : The influence of conductance catheter position <b>in</b> the <b>right</b> ventricle was examined in 10 patients. Insertion of the conductance catheter through the outflow tract was associated with a larger gain constant and a smaller parallel conductance compared with insertion through the tricuspid valve. Study 2 : The reproducibility of contractility measurements {{with the use of a}} conductance catheter was examined in 7 additional patients. Removal and reinsertion of the conductance catheter was not associated with any significant difference <b>in</b> <b>right</b> ventricular volume or contractile function. Study 3 : Right ventricular performance before and after cardiopulmonary bypass was compared in 8 additional patients. There was a fall in the slope of the right ventricular preload recruitable stroke work from 15. 6 (3. 8) to 11. 0 (5. 1) mm Hg (P =. 01) and an increase in the slope of the end-diastolic pressure-volume relations from 0. 05 (0. 02) to 0. 11 (0. 05) mm Hg/mL (P =. 001). Conclusions: The conductance technique can be used to study perioperative changes <b>in</b> <b>right</b> ventricular <b>performance.</b> Insertion of the conductance catheter through the outflow tract provides stable and reproducible data.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{examined}} whether {{individual differences}} in hemispheric utilization can interact with the intrinsic attentional biases of the cerebral hemispheres. Evidence suggests that the hemispheres have competing biases to direct attention contralaterally, with the left hemisphere (LH) having a stronger bias than the right hemisphere. There is also evidence that individuals have characteristic biases to utilize one hemisphere {{more than the other}} for processing information, which can induce a bias to direct attention to contralateral space. We predicted that LH-biased individuals would display a strong rightward attentional bias, which would create difficulty in selectively attending to target stimuli in the left visual field (LVF) as compared to <b>right</b> <b>in</b> the <b>performance</b> of a bilateral flanker task. Results Consistent with our hypothesis, flanker interference effects were found on the N 2 c event-related brain potential and error rate for LH-biased individuals in the Attend-LVF condition. The error rate effect was correlated with the degree of hemispheric utilization bias for the LH-Bias group. Conclusion We conclude that hemispheric utilization bias can enhance a hemisphere's contralateral attentional bias, at least for individuals with a LH utilization bias. Hemispheric utilization bias may play an important and largely unrecognized role in visuospatial attention. </p...|$|R
