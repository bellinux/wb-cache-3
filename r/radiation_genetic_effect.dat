40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a statistical approach which incorporates pedigree {{information in the}} form of relationship matrices into the analysis of standard agricultural genetic trials, where elite lines are tested. Allowing for the varying levels of inbreeding of the lines which occur in these types of trials, the approach involves the partitioning of the <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> of lines into additive <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> and non-additive <b>genetic</b> <b>effects.</b> The current methodology for creating relationship matrices is developed and in particular an approach to create the dominance matrix under full inbreeding in a more efficient manner is presented. A new method for creating the dominance matrix assuming no inbreeding is also presented. The application of the approach to the single site analyses of wheat breeding trials is shown. The wheat lines evaluated in these trials are inbred lines so that the total <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> of each of the lines is partitioned into an additive <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> and an epistatic <b>genetic</b> <b>effect.</b> Multi-environment trial analysis is also explored through the application of the approach to a sugarcane breeding trial. The sugarcane lines are hybrids and therefore the total <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> of each hybrid is partitioned into an additive <b>genetic</b> <b>effect,</b> a heterozygous dominance <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> and a residual non-additive <b>genetic</b> <b>effect.</b> Finally, the approach for inbred lines is examined in a simulations study where the levels of heritability and the genetic variation as a proportion of total trial variation is explored in single site analyses.

For many animals, part of the environment is social and provided by parents and other interacting partners. When expression of genes in social partners affects trait expression in a focal individual, indirect <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> occur. In this study, we explore the <b>effects</b> of indirect <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> on the magnitude and range of phenotypic values in a focal individual in a multi-member model analyzing three possible classes of interactions between individuals.

First, they are parameterizations of the genotypic values determined by the model of <b>genetic</b> <b>effects.</b> Second, they are consequently also affected by the regression method used to estimate the genotypic values from the observed marker genotypes and phenotypes. There are two common causes for marker-genotype data to be incomplete in those experiments—missing marker-genotypes and within-interval mapping.

Several traits related to ascites were measured on more than 4, 000 broilers kept under cold conditions. Heritabilities were estimated using an animal model with a direct <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> and a model with direct and maternal <b>genetic</b> <b>effects.</b> Estimated heritabilities from the direct <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> model were 0. 46 for hematocrit value, 0. 42 for BW, 0. 47 for right ventricular weight, 0. 46 for total ventricular weight, 0. 45 for ratio of right ventricular weight to the total ventricular weight, 0. 32 for total mortality, and 0. 18 for fluid accumulation in the heart sac. Maternal effects significantly influenced the traits BW, total ventricular weight, and total mortality.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundDominance and {{imprinting}} <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> {{have been}} shown to contribute to genetic variance for certain traits but are usually ignored in genomic prediction of complex traits in livestock. The objectives of this study were to estimate variances of additive, dominance and imprinting <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> and to evaluate predictions of genetic merit based on genomic data for average daily gain (DG) and backfat thickness (BF) in Danish Duroc pigs. MethodsCorrected phenotypes of 8113 genotyped pigs from breeding and multiplier herds were used. Four Bayesian mixture models that differed in the type of <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> included: (A) additive <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> (AD) additive and dominance <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> (AI) additive and imprinting <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> and (ADI) additive, dominance and imprinting <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> were compared using Bayes factors. The ability of the models to predict genetic merit was compared with regard to prediction reliability and bias. ResultsBased on model ADI, narrow-sense heritabilities of 0. 18 and 0. 31 were estimated for DG and BF, respectively. Dominance and imprinting <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> accounted for 4. 0  to  4. 6 and 1. 3  to  1. 4  % of phenotypic variance, respectively, which were statistically significant. Across the four models, reliabilities of the predicted total genetic values (GTV, sum of all <b>genetic</b> <b>effects)</b> ranged from 16. 1 (AI) to 18. 4  % (AD) for DG and from 30. 1 (AI) to 31. 4  % (ADI) for BF. The least biased predictions of GTV were obtained with model AD, with regression coefficients of corrected phenotypes on GTV equal to 0. 824 (DG) and 0. 738 (BF). Reliabilities of genomic estimated breeding values (GBV, additive <b>genetic</b> <b>effects)</b> did not differ significantly among models for DG (between 16. 5 and 16. 7  %); however, for BF, model AD provided a significantly higher reliability (31. 3  %) than model A (30. 7  %). The least biased predictions of GBV were obtained with model AD with regression coefficients of 0. 872 for DG and 0. 764 for BF. ConclusionsDominance and genomic imprinting effects contribute significantly to the genetic variation of BF and DG in Danish Duroc pigs.

40|$|Social {{interactions}} between individuals {{living in a}} group can have {{both positive and negative}} effects on welfare, productivity, and health of these individuals. Negative effects of social interactions in livestock are easier to observe than positive effects. For example, laying hens may develop feather pecking, which can cause mortality due to cannibalism, and pigs may develop tail biting or excessive aggression. Several studies have shown that social interactions affect the genetic variation in a trait. Genetic improvement of socially-affected traits, however, has proven to be difficult until relatively recently. The use of classical selection methods, like individual selection, may result in selection responses opposite to expected, because these methods neglect the effect of an individual on its group mates (social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects).</b> It has become clear that improvement of socially-affected traits requires selection methods that take into account not only the direct effect of an individual on its own phenotype but also the social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> also known as indirect <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> of an individual on the phenotypes of its group mates. Here, we review the theoretical and empirical work on social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> with a focus on livestock. First, we present the theory of social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects.</b> Subsequently, we evaluate the evidence for social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> in livestock and other species, by reviewing estimates of genetic parameters for direct and social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects.</b> Then we describe the results of different selection experiments. Finally, we discuss issues concerning the implementation of social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> in livestock breeding programs. In our opinion, this review demonstrates that selection for socially-affected traits, using methods that target both the direct and social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> is a promising, but sometimes difficult to use in practice, tool to simultaneously improve production and welfare in livestock...|$|R

Here we develop a computational procedure that captures temporal changes in <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> and apply it to analyze transcription during inhibition of the TOR signaling pathway in segregating yeast cells. We found a high-order coordination of gene modules: sets of genes co-associated with the same genetic variant and sharing a common temporal <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> pattern. The temporal <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> of some modules represented a single state-transitioning pattern; for example, at 10 - 30 minutes following stimulation, <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> in the phosphate utilization module attained a characteristic transition to a new steady state.

40|$|Assessing {{the impact}} of the social {{environment}} on health and disease is challenging. As social effects are in part determined by the genetic makeup of social partners, they can be studied from associations between genotypes of one individual and phenotype of another (social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> SGE, also called indirect <b>genetic</b> <b>effects).</b> For the first time we quantified the contribution of SGE to more than 100 organismal phenotypes and genome-wide gene expression measured in laboratory mice. We find that genetic variation in cage mates (i. e. SGE) contributes to variation in organismal and molecular measures related to anxiety, wound healing, immune function, and body weight. Social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> explained up to 29 % of phenotypic variance, and for several traits their contribution exceeded that of direct <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> (effects of an individual's genotypes on its own phenotype). Importantly, we show that ignoring SGE can severely bias estimates of direct <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> (heritability). Thus SGE may be an important source of "missing heritability" in studies of complex traits in human populations.

Commonalities between clinically-assessed major depressive disorder (MDD) and self-declared depression (SDD) are also unclear. MethodsUsing data from a large Scottish family-based cohort (GS:SFHS, N= 19, 994), we estimated the genetic and environmental variance components for MDD and SDD. The components representing the <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> associated with genome-wide common genetic variants (SNP heritability), the additional pedigree-associated <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> and non-genetic effects associated with common environments were estimated in a linear mixed model (LMM). FindingsBoth MDD and SDD had significant contributions from components representing the <b>effect</b> from common <b>genetic</b> variants, the additional <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> associated with the pedigree and the common environmental effect shared by couples. The estimate of correlation between SDD and MDD was high (r= 1. 00, se= 0. 20) for common-variant-associated <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> and lower for the additional <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> from the pedigree (r= 0. 57, se= 0. 08) and the couple-shared environmental effect (r= 0. 53, se= 0. 22).

Two models were used: Model 1 includes month of calving, year of calving, parity as fixed effects, days open and days dry as covariates and direct genetic, maternal genetic, covariance between direct and maternal genetic, permanent environmental and residual as random effects; Model 2 is similar to Model 1, but excluding additive maternal and covariance between additive direct and maternal effects. Estimates of heritability for 305 day milk yield (305 dMY) were 0. 22 and 0. 23, for Model 1 and Model 2, respectively. Heritability estimates for age at first calving (AFC) were 0. 77 and 0. 82 for Model 1 and model 2, respectively. The removal of additive maternal <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> and covariance between direct and maternal <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> from the model increased estimates for heritability of additive <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> by 0. 01 and 0. 05 for 305 dMY and AFC, respectively. Then, the additive maternal <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> and covariance between direct and maternal <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> do not seem to make important contributions to the phenotypic variance for milk yield and age at first calving, and these effects are probably not important for genetic evaluations...|$|R
40|$|Maternal {{effects have}} been {{reported}} using different animal models for post weaning growth traits in some cattle breeds. Variance components for additive direct, additive maternal,permanent environmental maternal effects, the covariance between additive direct and maternal effects were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood, fitting five animal models from 2978 of 18 months(18 MW) weight pedigree records of indigenous Tuli cattle of Zimbabwe. All investigated models included a random direct <b>genetic</b> <b>effect,</b> but different combinations of random maternal genetic and permanent environmental effects {{as well as for}} direct-maternal genetic covariance. The direct heritability (h 2 a) were constant (0. 10) when the maternal <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> were included in the model, while (h 2 a) estimates were higher (0. 22) and (0. 63) when maternal effects were excluded. The maternal heritability(h 2 m) was (0. 23) and higher than the direct heritability (0. 10) when only maternal <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> were included in the model and did not change even when the permanent environmental effects of the dam was added. The permanent environmental effects of the dam was negligible and a strong positive correlation between direct and maternal <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> (? 2 am) was observed. The strong positive genetic correlation between direct and maternal <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> would not limit the effective utilization of both direct and maternal effects in selection for 18 MW growth in indigenous Tuli cattle. A simple animal model with additive direct <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> as the only random effect would be appropriate for genetic evaluation of 18 MW in indigenous Tuli cattle. ...|$|R
40|$|Division {{of labor}} {{is central to}} the {{organization}} of insect societies. Within-colony comparisons between subfamilies of workers (patrilines or matrilines) revealed <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> on division of labor in many social insect species. Although this has been taken as evidence for additive <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> on division of labor, it has never been experimentally tested. To determine the relative roles of additive and nonadditive <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> (e. g., <b>genetic</b> compatibility, epistasis, and parent-of-origin imprinting effects) on worker behavior, we performed controlled crosses using the Argentine ant Linepithema humile. Three of the measured behaviors (the efficiency to collect pupae, the foraging propensity, and the distance between non-brood-tenders and brood) were affected by the maternal genetic background and the two others (the efficiency to feed larvae and the distance between brood-tenders and brood) by the paternal genetic background. Moreover, there were significant interactions between the maternal and paternal genetic backgrounds for three of the five behaviors. These results are most consistent with parent-of-origin and <b>genetic</b> compatibility <b>effects</b> on division of labor. The finding of nonadditive <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> is in strong contrast with the current view and has important consequences for our understanding of division of labor in insect societies...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{parameter}} estimation for simple carcass traits has {{been confined to}} the improved goat breeds worldwide unlike in the unimproved breeds in developing countries where goats are numerous. Variance components for additive direct, additive maternal, permanent environmental maternal effects, the covariance between additive direct and maternal effects were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood, fitting five animal models from 2341 (1359 males; 982 females) hot carcass weight pedigree records collected {{over a period of}} 13 years (1984 - 1997) of indigenous Matebele goat of Zimbabwe. All investigated models included a random direct <b>genetic</b> <b>effect,</b> but different combinations of random maternal genetic and permanent environmental maternal effects as well as direct-maternal genetic covariance. The analytical models included fixed effects of sex, age at slaughter and year of slaughter. The direct heritability (h 2 a) ranged from 0. 14 to 0. 26 when the maternal <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> were included in the model, whereas h 2 a estimate was 0. 26 when maternal effects were excluded. The maternal heritability (h 2 m) was 0. 00 when only maternal <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> were included in the model and were 0. 05 and 0. 10 when the permanent environmental effect of the dam was added. The permanent environmental effect of the dam was negligible. A positive covariances between direct and maternal <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> (σ 2 am) was observed when maternal <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> and permanent environmental maternal effects were accounted for in the model. A simple animal model with direct additive <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> as the only random effects other than the residuals was the best model for genetic evaluation of hot carcass weight in indigenous Matebele goat. </p...|$|R
