The chicks (375) were randomly placed into five climatic chambers set to distinct thermal conditions, being: one as recommended by the literature, another as stated by Cassuce and the other three at different levels of apparent cold stress (mild, moderate and severe).

40|$|A basic {{cryopreservation}} {{protocol for}} great scallop sperm was recently published, with which thawed sperm survival remained limited to 25 % of control values (Suquet et al. 2014). We designed here {{a set of}} five experiments to test ways of improving thawed sperm survival and storage by studying the effects of (1) cryoprotectant concentration; (2) sugar incorporation in the extender; (3) egg yolk addition to the extender; (4) sperm dilution rate; and (5) storage capacity of thawed sperm at 4 degrees C. A sixth experiment was then performed to compare <b>rearing</b> <b>performances</b> of larvae produced using thawed sperm from the optimal protocol defined {{in the present study}} with those produced using fresh sperm. During the first experiment, a significantly higher percentage of motile spermatozoa was recorded after thawing when the treatment had included 15 or 20 % polyethylene glycol (PEG). In the second experiment, no significant improvement in post-thaw sperm motility was recorded when trehalose or glucose was added to the extender. In the third experiment, adding 10 or 20 % egg yolk to the extender significantly decreased the percentage of motile sperm. During the fourth experiment, significantly higher percentages of motile sperm were observed for dilution rates ranging from 3 : 1 to 1 : 1 than for higher dilution rates. In the fifth experiment, a significant decrease in the percentage of post-thawed sperm was observed for storage durations of 30 and 60 min, relative to shorter durations. During the last experiment, similar <b>rearing</b> <b>performances</b> were observed between larvae produced using fresh and thawed sperm, up to 9 days post fertilization. In conclusion, the high survival of sperm recorded after thawing (67 % of the control level) and the high <b>rearing</b> <b>performances</b> of progenies obtained using thawed sperm validate the use of the present improved cryopreservation protocol for sperm cryobanking in great scallop...|$|R

Screening for thermotolerance in the silkworm, Bombyxmori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) is an essential prerequisite for the development of thermotolerant breeds/hybrids. In the current study, the aim was to identify potential bivoltine silkworm strains specific for tolerance to high temperature.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of certain highly unsaturated fatty acids in osmotic regulation, {{few studies have been}} addressed to determine the essential fatty acid requirements for a given species cultured under different salinities. As Galaxias maculatus is a diadromic species, the present study aimed to determine the effect of salinity on the optimum dietary EPA/docosahexaenoic (DHA) ratio for survival and growth during the larval stages. Larvae were fed for 20 days with rotifers containing two different EPA/DHA ratios (low: 0. 64 and high: 2. 18) at three different salinities (0, 10 and 15 g L- 1). The results of this study showed a marked effect of water salinity on larval dietary lipid utilization in G. maculatus larvae. These results suggested that G. maculatus larvae reared at higher salinities may have a higher dietary requirement for DHA, whereas larvae reared at 0 ‰ showed higher requirements for EPA.

Thus, two complete extruded isoproteic diets with different crude fat to N-free extract ratio (CF/NFE: L= 1. 0 vs. H= 1. 5) were tested in juvenile shi drum to evaluate productive performances and quality traits of the final product. Experimental trial was conducted over summer 2001 using 4 groups of 200 fish (IBW = 83  25 g) fed 2 % BW. Growth parameters and feed efficiency were recorded and fish were submitted to morphometric, chemical and reological analysis. Considering a 4 months feeding period L-diet fed fish showed a significant greater weight gain than H-fed fish due to a higher specific growth rate (SGR) and a lower food conversion ratio (FCR). Chemical composition of whole body fish resulted in higher crude protein and lower lipids contents for animals of L-diet thesis.

To demonstrate {{the effectiveness of this}} technique, we conducted rearing trials using fish from two different strains: AB and nacre. Growth, survival, water quality, and rotifer density were assayed daily through the polyculture phase (days 5 – 9), and during the transition to standard rearing conditions (days 10 – 12). After that point, once the fish were fully integrated onto recirculating systems, parameters were measured once per week out to day 30.
