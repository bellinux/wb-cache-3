5|$|Although the {{ingredients}} of the BLT have existed for many years, {{there is little evidence}} of BLT sandwich recipes prior to 1900. In the 1903 Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book, a <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> club sandwich included bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and a slice of turkey sandwiched between two slices of bread. Whilst the 1929 book Seven Hundred Sandwiches does include a section on bacon sandwiches, the recipes often include pickles and none contain tomato.|$|E

25|$|Cato wrote {{extensively}} on the medical uses of wine, including a <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> laxative: wine made from grapevines treated {{with a mixture of}} ashes, manure and hellebore. He recommended that the flowers of certain plants, e.g. juniper and myrtle, be soaked in wine to help with snakebites and gout. He also believed that a mixture of old wine and juniper, boiled in a lead pot, could aid in urinary issues and that mixing wine with very acidic pomegranates could cure tapeworms.|$|E
25|$|Mezcal {{is highly}} varied, {{depending}} on the species of agave used, the fruits and herbs added during fermentation and the distillation process employed, creating subtypes with names such as de gusano, tobalá, pechuga, blanco, minero, cedrón, de alacran, creme de café and more. A special <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> specific mezcal type known as pechuga uses cinnamon, apple, plums, cloves, and other spices that is then distilled through chicken, duck, or turkey breast. It is made when the specific fruits used in the recipe are available, usually during November or December. Other variations flavor the mash with cinnamon, pineapple slices, red bananas, and sugar, each imparting a particular character to the mezcal. Most mezcal, however, is left untouched, allowing the flavors of the agave used to come forward.|$|E

The cut of beef used is generally skirt steak. Swede is sometimes called turnip in Cornwall, but the recipe requires use of actual swede, not turnip. Pasty ingredients are usually seasoned with salt and pepper, depending on individual taste. The use of carrot in a traditional Cornish pasty is frowned upon, though it does appear regularly in recipes.|$|E

500|$|The title The Cookbook derived of Elliott feeling [...] "no two {{records are}} going to sound alike; each record has its own spices and herbs.

Whether they was on railroad tracks or cooking in somebody's kitchen, they was always singing." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} Luciano Revoredo, {{the preparation}} of pisco with lemon dates {{as far back as}} the 18th century. He bases his claim on a source found in the Mercurio Peruano which details the prohibition of aguardiente in Lima's Plaza de toros de Acho, the oldest bullring in the Americas. At this time, the drink was named Punche (Punch), and was sold by slaves. Revoredo further argues this drink served as the predecessor of the Californian Pisco punch, invented by Duncan Nicol in the Bank Exchange Bar of San Francisco, California. A <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pisco-based punch, including egg whites, was found by researcher Nico Vera in the 1903 Peruvian cookbook Manual de Cocina a la Criolla; consequently, culinary expert Duggan McDonnell considers that [...] "t is entirely possible that the 'Cocktail' that came to be the pisco sour [...] had been prepared for a reasonable time in Lima before being included in a cookbook." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} several {{references to}} The Beatles and McCartney's solo career.

A {{modified version of}} the song plays in the final scene, then over the closing credits of the episode; when played backwards, McCartney can be heard reciting the recipe in the song. Mirkin had McCartney record the recipe, which was later added in reverse over the original song. McCartney thought it was [...] "very funny" [...] that the staff wanted to [...] "send up the whole cult thing" [...] of backmasking on the Beatles' songs. [...] "A secret lentil soup recipe seemed a nice parody of that", he said. One of the backwards snippets says, [...] "Oh, and by the way, I'm alive", a reference to the [...] "Paul is dead" [...] urban legend.|$|E

500|$|Neela Debnath of The Independent {{described}} the episode as [...] "the perfect <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Christmas special", particularly praising the touching moments. In the same paper's DVD review, Ben Walsh gave [...] "The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe" [...] {{four out of}} five stars, calling it [...] "best Doctor Who Christmas Special for some years". He commented that [...] "the eco-message is a bit laboured, but the central tragedy that powers this scatty episode is a poignant one". Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern was pleased, despite noting that he had low expectations for the special. He particularly praised Smith's performance, although he noted that the [...] "heart-warming" [...] scene with Amy and Rory called for a [...] "companions shake-up" [...] next series. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave [...] "The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe" [...] an A-, feeling that it could stand proudly beside [...] "A Christmas Carol", the previous Christmas special.|$|E
500|$|The {{actual number}} of recipes {{deviates}} from that claimed by the author. On the one hand, {{there may be more}} than one recipe under a single numbered heading. For example, under number 4 in chapter 1, there are three disparate recipes, one for stewed meat in saffron sauce, one for a thick sauce of sieved vegetables and one for boiled meatballs, as well as a tip to add raisins only to those dishes that are meant to be sweet. Chapter 2 opens with five unnumbered recipes for sauces to be used with fish. On the other hand, some of the numbered headings are not followed by any actual recipe, serving only to reiterate that various dishes may be prepared using the same basic technique. For instance, in chapter 3, the <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> puff-pastry apple tart, is followed by eleven numbered headings saying, [...] "pear tart likewise", [...] "woodland strawberry tart likewise", [...] "sour cherry tart likewise", and so on for fig, prune, date, gooseberry, peach, plum, currant and quince tarts.|$|E
500|$|The BLT Cookbook {{begins with}} a <b>recipe</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> mini-cocktail {{selection}} of the BLT, followed by a larger version that the author recommends for large gatherings such as picnics. Non-traditional presentations of the BLT combination include [...] "Tomatoes Stuffed with Bacon Risotto", [...] "Potato Soup with Tomatoes and Bacon" [...] and [...] "Tomato Bread Pudding". The author presents varieties of the BLT that omit one ingredient. [...] "The Fisherman's BLT"which uses seafoodis {{an alternative to the}} standard sandwich and the [...] "ZLT" [...] comprises zucchini, lettuce and tomato. Jordan was inspired by a salmon sandwich she bought at Pike Place Market in Seattle to create a BLT sandwich with salmon. The [...] "Bacon, Leek and Tomato Strudel" [...] is a dish that does not use bread. All recipes presented in The BLT Cookbook include tomatoes. Towards the end of the book, recipes for bread pudding, strudel and tomato pie are included. Selected wines that Jordan recommends to accompany her dishes include a Rhone-style red, beaujolais, or pinot noir.|$|E
