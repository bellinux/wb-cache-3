It is an excellent abrasive medium as well as a construction material with high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>mechanical</b> and chemical <b>deterioration.</b> Under standard condition, silicon carbide has no melting point (decomposes at 2700 °C – principle used for industrial production of silicon),thus the bulk form must be prepared in a composite form with a metallic, ceramic or polymer binder. This method is suitable for tailoring of mechanical properties; nevertheless,it does not produce SiC form applicable for laboratory purposes. Binder-free sintering of SiC is practically impossible, despite decreased chemical resistivity of the produced material. Pure SiC is insoluble in all acids except hydrofluoric acid. Reaction of SiC with HF is enabled only due to residual SiO 2 created during the industrial production. However, SiO 2 located between the planes of growth of Si...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} scrutinizes the popular view that tremors of central origin but {{not those of}} {{peripheral}} origin are largely resistant <b>to</b> <b>mechanical</b> perturbations. We explore the effects of perturbations in a well-established model of peripheral tremor and document that (a) tremor frequency can remain unchanged when spring or weight loads are added, (b) entrainment by external drives can be limited to drives of similar frequency, and (c) resetting of tremor phase by torque pulses can remain fractional. This <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>mechanical</b> perturbations arises in the model because peripheral neuromuscular dynamics act as a limit-cycle oscillator which, by its very nature, will absorb moderate changes to signals and parameters. We conclude from our study that <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>mechanical</b> perturbations is not an exclusive property of central tremors, but rather may {{also be found in}} peripheral tremors.

40|$|Amyloid {{structures}} {{have been}} identified as a key pathological marker in a range of conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. A combination of their disease relevance and potential nanomaterial applications has made understanding amyloid formation and the source of its toxicity of great interest. The fragmentation of amyloid fibrils into smaller particles is important for the kinetics of their formation and how they elicit toxicity. This thesis sheds light on how fibrils formed from different proteins fragment, and compares their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>mechanical</b> stress, in order to decipher if fibril fragmentation mechanism is fibril dependent or a property shared by amyloid fibrils in general. To accomplish these goals, this thesis is divided into three sections. The first part of this thesis develops methods for recombinant production and purification of Sup 35 NMC, Sup 35 NM and α-synuclein proteins. In vitro polymerisation conditions for these proteins and the commercial proteins lysozyme, β-lactoglobulin and insulin B chain has enabled, via AFM imaging methods and MatLab tracing, the calculation of persistence length from far larger populations than has previously been observed. The second part investigates the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>mechanical</b> stress of α-synuclein, β-lactoglobulin and lysozyme fibrils using a fragmentation assay, which enables the determination and comparison of the fibrils’ <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>mechanical</b> stress. This work has demonstrated that polymer rigidity (Lp) is inherently linked <b>to</b> the <b>resistance</b> of the tested amyloid fibrils <b>to</b> <b>mechanical</b> stress. The third part of the thesis successfully implements a chemical labelling strategy using ‘click’ chemistry to allow a modification of fibril functionality. This has been applied to fluorescence labelling strategies and 19 F-labelling for novel methods of determining the population size of amyloid fibrils by 19 F DOSY NMR...|$|R

30|$|Results showed that, as the {{concentration}} increased, the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>mechanical</b> degradation also increased. This made the 100  wppm solution the least resistant and 1000  wppm solution {{the most resistant}} <b>to</b> <b>mechanical</b> degradation. These results agreed with those reported by as Soares et al. (2015), indicating that increasing polymer concentration (PAM or PEO) in the solution could increase the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>mechanical</b> degradation. It was also observed that the shear stabilities of 100, 150, 200  wppm solutions were very close and followed the same trends. In other words, 200  ppm solution was only slightly more resistant to degradation (DR t= 120 /DRmax =  0.5) than 100  wppm solution (DR t= 120 /DRmax =  0.39). But, above 200  wppm a sudden rise in the shear resistance of the solutions was observed. Both 500 and 1000  wppm solutions showed superior shear stability compared to other solutions. We found that although 200  wppm HPAM solution had similar initial DR% to 500 and 1000  wppm solutions (Fig.  6), it had a larger decline in DR (Fig.  7). The values of DR t= 120 /DRmax for 500 and 1000  wppm solutions were 0.62 and 0.72 {{at the end of}} 2 -h shearing period, respectively. It is also {{interesting to note that the}} DR/DRmax declined at a slower rate after t =  60  min.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} efforts of {{increasing}} {{the quality of a}} product when the process generating the product was complex. The process studied was complex in that the amount of factors that were believed to affect the different quality aspect was very large, while the many interdependent factors made the relations between the different factors difficult to discover. The process that was investigated was the mining group LKAB's production of iron ore pellet specially developed for direct reduction. The large size of the product makes it demanding regarding the process's ability to satisfy the conditions that the pellets require to obtain a higher <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>mechanical</b> abrasion. Fine-grained decomposition of the product gives lower revenues and can cause problems in the direct reduction process. It was therefore of interest for LKAB to better understand how the problem could be avoided. Several factors were believed to influence these properties, but {{the purpose of this study}} was to specifically explore the impact of the choice of fuel for the burner used in the pelletizing. The burner is used in the pelletizing process to add heat to the process and sinter the pellets, in this case in the production of direct reduction pellets in Kiruna Pelletizing Plant 3. LKAB primarily uses coal as fuel for the burner, but oil is used as fuel in cases when coal for various reasons can’t be used. The relation linked to the choice of fuel and its impact on the pellets <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>mechanical</b> abrasion were investigated by the use of controlled experiments, and analysis of historical data in the form of an exploratory data analysis and a multiple regression analysis. Based on these analyzes, it was not possible to reveal any clear-cut link between the choice of fuel and the pellets <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>mechanical</b> abrasion. The analyzes did however mainly point out that if there is a relation, the use of coal is to be preferred as it produces the best pellets in terms of its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> abrasion. The recommendations to LKAB that the study resulted in thus has been to continue to use coal as often as possible as it possibly could have a positive impact on the product's ability <b>to</b> withstand <b>mechanical</b> abrasion while it also is more economical than using oil.

40|$|A {{specific}} rigid element {{approach is}} {{proposed for the}} in-plane dynamical analysis of masonry walls, whose seismic performance is strongly related <b>to</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>deterioration</b> and hysteretic energy dissipation. Since the execution of effective time-history analysis necessitates the use of discrete models with reduced number of degrees of freedom, the tricky issue lies in achieving a balance between accuracy in the geometrical description {{and the need for}} a realistic damage material model. For this reason, a mechanistic ``rigid body spring model'' RBSM was adopted, which consists of a collection of plane quadrilateral rigid elements connected to each other by two normal springs and one shear spring at each side. The material model was based on a phenomenological description of the cyclic response of masonry, and specific separate hysteretic laws were assigned for the axial and shear deformation between the elements. This separation led to a large reduction in computational effort, though a Coulomb-like law was adopted in order to relate the strength of the shear springs to the vertical axial loading. The effective performance of the present approach is demonstrated by the numerical validation and by comparisons with some well-known experimental and numerical tests presented in the literature...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the radial hydride {{formation}} in cold worked and stress relieved (CWSR) Zircaloy- 4 cladding was performed using a ring tensile method and finite element analysis. Un-irradiated Zircaloy- 4 cladding ring specimens charged with hydrogen were tested at various temperatures and loading conditions. Measured threshold stresses at loaded temperatures of 400 degrees C, 335 degrees C, 300 degrees C, and 235 degrees C {{turned out to be}} 60 +/- 5 MPa, 68 +/- 5 MPa, 75 +/- 6 MPa, and 90 +/- 6 MPa, respectively, demonstrating the tendency of decreasing threshold stress with increasing temperature. These stresses were lower than previously reported ones and close to the lower bound of collected data from the literature. These results reveal that high temperature preheating seems to affect an initiation of the reorientation. This implies that temperature increase caused by the vacuum drying of spent fuel assemblies for transportation can promote the hydride reorientation, leading <b>to</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>deterioration</b> of the cladding.
