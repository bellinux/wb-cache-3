25|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{fitted with}} a retractable tricycle undercarriage with steerable nosewheels, allowing a fairly large crab angle during cross-wind landing. The <b>reverse</b> <b>pitch</b> control with which the aircraft is fitted allows the constant-speed mechanism to be manually overridden to reverse the blade pitch angle, thus providing excellent ground-handling characteristics, helping {{to slow down the}} plane to shorten the landing run. This control also allows the aircraft to back up on its own during taxiing.|$|E
25|$|The Be-103 {{features}} include an advanced, blended wing, swept at 22°, with -long {{fixed leading edge}} slats, trailing-link main landing gear, and three-bladed MT-12 <b>reverse</b> <b>pitch</b> propellers. Fuel is stored in the wet wings. The aircraft is built from aluminum-lithium alloy with titanium used in high-stress areas. A 30-parameter, five-hour flight data recorder, engine fire-detection systems and an ice detector are also standard, as are hydraulic brakes. However, unlike most modern aircraft, the Be-103 is not equipped with wing flaps.|$|E
5000|$|Fisher {{conducted}} nearly 200 {{of these}} high rate/low speed descents and demonstrated the technique for Generals"Hap" [...] Arnold and Dwight Eisenhower in 1948. For the latest pressurized airliners and combat aircraft that operated at high altitudes, {{this was an}} effective method of safely dumping altitude {{in the event of}} an emergency, and was adopted worldwide as a safe procedure. Fisher was also instrumental in developing the use of <b>reversing</b> <b>pitch</b> to rapidly slow an aircraft, which allowed them to land safely on shorter runways, and, in general, greatly reduce the incidence of runway overruns.|$|R
50|$|The ADO15 used a {{conventional}} BMC A-Series four-cylinder, water-cooled engine, but departed from tradition by mounting it transversely, with the engine-oil-lubricated, four-speed transmission in the sump, and by employing front-wheel drive. Almost all small front-wheel-drive cars developed since {{have used a}} similar configuration, except with the transmission usually separately enclosed rather than using the engine oil. The radiator was mounted at {{the left side of}} the car so that the engine-mounted fan could be retained, but with <b>reversed</b> <b>pitch</b> so that it blew air into the natural low pressure area under the front wing. This location saved vehicle length, but had the disadvantage of feeding the radiator with air that had been heated by passing over the engine. It also exposed the entire ignition system to the direct ingress of rainwater through the grille.|$|R
50|$|Barracudas {{were used}} to test several {{innovations}} including RATOG rockets for takeoff and a braking propeller which slowed the aircraft by <b>reversing</b> the blade <b>pitch.</b>|$|R
25|$|Hughes was {{involved}} in another near-fatal aircraft accident on July 7, 1946, while performing the first flight of the prototype U.S. Army Air Forces reconnaissance aircraft, the XF-11, near Hughes airfield at Culver City, California. An oil leak caused one of the contra-rotating propellers to <b>reverse</b> <b>pitch,</b> causing the aircraft to yaw sharply and lose altitude rapidly. Hughes attempted to save the aircraft by landing it at the Los Angeles Country Club golf course, but just seconds before reaching the course, the XF-11 started to drop dramatically and crashed in the Beverly Hills neighborhood surrounding the country club.|$|E
2500|$|The B-36 was {{too large}} to fit in most hangars. Since even an {{aircraft}} with {{the range of the}} B-36 needed to be stationed as close to enemy targets as possible, this meant the plane was largely based in the extreme weather locations of the northern continental United States, Alaska and the Arctic. Since the maintenance had to be performed outdoors, the crews were largely exposed to the elements, with temperatures of [...] in winters and [...] in summers, depending on the airbase location. Special shelters were built so that the maintenance crews could be given a modicum of protection. Ground crews were at risk of slipping and falling from icy wings, or being blown off the wings by propeller wash running in <b>reverse</b> <b>pitch.</b> The wing roots were thick enough, at 7ft (2.1m), to enable a flight engineer to access the engines and landing gear during flight by crawling through the wings. This was possible only at altitudes not requiring pressurization.|$|E

50|$|Pregame Line: Virginia +16.5Georgia Tech {{ended its}} three-game losing streak to UVA with a {{dominating}} defensive effort and superb performances by Reggie Ball and Calvin Johnson. Reggie Ball is now 1-3 against the Wahoos and had 205 yards passing, 2 touchdown passes, and a rushing touchdown. Calvin Johnson set his personal longest touchdown reception record twice recording 58 and 66 yard {{touchdowns in a}} 165-yard effort. Tashard Choice, Rashaun Grant, and Jamaal Evans added 103 yards on 26 carries between them. Patrick Nix called three risky plays in the game. The first was a fullback pass from Mike Cox to Reggie Ball. The blocking back has never rushed for yardage but managed to complete a 17-yard pass to Ball. Rashaun Grant also received two <b>reverse</b> <b>pitches</b> from Tashard Choice, which netted only 7 yards. The defense held the Cavs to 166 yards of offense and forced three turnovers (two interceptions by Djay Jones and Jahi Word-Daniels and a fumble recovery by Jamal Lewis). The only Cavalier score {{was made possible by}} a fourth quarter fumble by Ball and Choice on a speed option. Also of note, Georgia Tech sported a white helmet and mustard uniform from the Bud Carson era (1969-1971).|$|R
40|$|A {{stabilized}} pinch configuration is described, {{consisting of a}} D-shaped plasma cross section wrapped tightly around a guiding axis. The {open_quotes}helical-D{close_quotes} geometry produces a very large axial (toroidal) transform of magnetic line direction that <b>reverses</b> the <b>pitch</b> of the magnetic lines without the need of azimuthal (poloidal) plasma current. Thus, {{there is no need}} of a {open_quotes}dynamo{close_quotes} process and its associated fluctuations. The resulting configuration has the high magnetic shear and pitch reversal of the reversed field pinch (RFP). (Pitch = P = qR, where R = major radius). A helical-D pinch might demonstrate good confinement at q << 1...|$|R
5000|$|Radio-controlled helicopters, {{although}} often grouped with RC aircraft, {{are in a}} {{class of}} their own because of the vast differences in construction, aerodynamics and flight training. Hobbyists will often venture from planes, to jets and to helicopters as they enjoy the challenges, excitement and satisfaction of flying. Some radio-controlled helicopters have photo or video cameras installed and are used for aerial imaging or surveillance. Newer [...] "3d" [...] radio-control helicopters can fly inverted with the advent of advanced swash heads, and servo linkage that enables the pilot to immediately <b>reverse</b> the <b>pitch</b> of the blades, creating a reverse in thrust.|$|R

50|$|The {{investigation}} {{found that a}} series of non-standard actions resulted in severe loss of airspeed due to the accidental selection of the propellers into <b>reverse</b> <b>pitch</b> (<b>reverse</b> <b>pitch</b> is normally only used to slow an aircraft on the ground). The aircraft subsequently impacted 6NM (11 km) short of the runway. Contributing to the accident were errors concerning {{the implementation of a}} safety recommendation which had been made by the manufacturer to Fokker 50 operators. In addition, this warning had not been adequately communicated to Luxair flight crews.|$|E

5000|$|Later, {{flying a}} U.S. Navy Grumman F8F Bearcat fighter, Fisher {{developed}} {{a way to}} fly [...] "zero-g", vertical dives. From 20,000 ft, the F8F would be nosed down into a vertical dive, while he simultaneously <b>reversed</b> the propeller <b>pitch.</b> This technique allowed a controlled vertical dive at rates of descent that varied between 30,000 and 37,000 fpm.|$|R
50|$|Aside from {{landing gear}} brakes, most large {{aircraft}} have {{other ways of}} decelerating. In aircraft, air brakes are aerodynamic surfaces that create friction, with the air flow causing the vehicle to slow. These are usually implemented as flaps that oppose air flow when extended and are flush with aircraft when retracted. Reverse thrust is also used in many aeroplane engines. Propeller aircraft achieve reverse thrust by <b>reversing</b> the <b>pitch</b> of the propellers, while jet aircraft do so by redirecting their engine exhaust forwards. On aircraft carriers, arresting gears are used to stop an aircraft. Pilots may even apply full forward throttle on touchdown, in case the arresting gear does not catch and a go around is needed.|$|R
2500|$|Hughes did {{not follow}} the agreed testing program and {{communications}} protocol, and remained airborne almost {{twice as long as}} planned. An hour into the flight (after onboard recording cameras had run out of film), a leak caused the right-hand propeller controls to lose their effectiveness and the rear propeller subsequently <b>reversed</b> its <b>pitch,</b> disrupting that engine's thrust, which caused the aircraft to yaw hard to the right. The USAAF account said that, [...] "It appeared that loss of hydraulic fluid caused failure of the pitch change mechanism of right rear propeller. Mr. Hughes maintained full power of right engine and reduced that of left engine instead of trying to fly with right propeller windmilling without power.

5000|$|A {{fixed-wing}} aircraft generates forward thrust when air is pushed {{in the direction}} opposite to flight. This {{can be done in}} several ways including by the spinning blades of a propeller, or a rotating fan pushing air out from the back of a jet engine, or by ejecting hot gases from a rocket engine. [...] The forward thrust is proportional to the mass of the airstream multiplied by the difference in velocity of the airstream. Reverse thrust can be generated to aid braking after landing by <b>reversing</b> the <b>pitch</b> of variable-pitch propeller blades, or using a thrust reverser on a jet engine. Rotary wing aircraft and thrust vectoring V/STOL aircraft use engine thrust to support the weight of the aircraft, and vector sum of this thrust fore and aft to control forward speed.|$|R

50|$|On 10 February 2004, Kish Air Flight 7170, {{operated}} by a Fokker 50 Mk.050, crashed at Sharjah International Airport killing 43 people. Three survived with serious injuries. The cause was that the propellors were put into <b>reverse</b> <b>pitch</b> while the aircraft was in flight.|$|E
50|$|In some aircraft, {{such as the}} C-130 Hercules, {{the pilot}} can {{manually}} override the constant-speed mechanism to <b>reverse</b> the blade <b>pitch</b> angle, and thus reverse {{the thrust of the}} engine (although the rotation of the engine itself does not reverse). This is used to help slow the plane down after landing in order to save wear on the brakes and tires, but in some cases also allows the aircraft to back up on its own - this is particularly useful for getting floatplanes out of confined docks. See also Thrust reversal.|$|R

50|$|Pitch is {{controlled}} by the rear part of the tailplane's horizontal stabilizer being hinged to create an elevator. By moving the elevator control backwards the pilot moves the elevator up (a position of negative camber) and the downwards force on the horizontal tail is increased. The angle of attack on the wings increased so the nose is pitched up and lift is generally increased. In micro-lights and hang gliders the <b>pitch</b> action is <b>reversed</b> - the <b>pitch</b> control system is much simpler so when the pilot moves the elevator control backwards it produces a nose-down pitch and the angle of attack on the wing is reduced.|$|R
