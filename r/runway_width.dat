50|$|After {{the loss}} of the community's mining industry, Uranium City began a sharp depopulation. The Saskatchewan provincial {{government}} assumed ownership of the airport in early 1997 from Transport Canada. The facility was downgraded two years later as its runway was shortened from 5000 ft to 3930 ft, while the <b>runway's</b> <b>width</b> was halved to 100 ft.|$|R
5000|$|The older {{parallel}} runway, Runway 6C/24C, was 7,096 x 150 ft. (2163 x 46 m). Several {{years ago}} it was decommissioned as a <b>runway,</b> its <b>width</b> narrowed, and it is now designated Taxiway C. [...] "TAXI" [...] in large yellow letters on each end is intended to discourage approaching aircraft using it as a runway.|$|R
30|$|The {{operational}} {{conditions in the}} active runway crossing operation are characterized by two elements namely the runway configuration and visibility conditions. For the first element, runway characteristics such as <b>runway</b> length, <b>width,</b> location of stopbars, and number of branches are specified.

50|$|Having {{a runway}} length of 3,227 meters and a <b>runway</b> <b>width</b> of 45 meters, General Santos International Airport has the country's third longest runway—to date—after Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila and Mactan-Cebu International Airport in Cebu. It {{is the first}} airport in Mindanao to have {{accommodated}} the landing and take off of Boeing 747 aircraft. The airport is also capable of handling landings and take-offs of even larger aircraft such as Airbus A380.|$|E
50|$|By end of June 2011, a new {{terminal}} spanning 17,000 square meters {{and a more}} spacious aircraft apron which can accommodate 10 wide-body aircraft, twice {{the capacity of the}} old apron will be operated. To meet the technical requirements of a world-class airport, the airport runway would be extended from 2,200 meters to 2,600 meters and then to 3,000 meters and <b>runway</b> <b>width</b> extension from 30 m to 45 m. Expansion of the airport is part of infrastructure development in support of the 2012 Pekan Olahraga Nasional which was held in Pekanbaru.|$|E
5000|$|While the New {{terminal}} building, {{capable of}} handling 300 passengers at peak hours, featured six check-in counters, VIP Lounges, Departure and Arrival Lounges, Transit Suites & Snooze Cabins, Visitors Waiting Area and Cafeteria, the airside saw drastic improvements too. The sole runway was extended from 1375 metres to 2300 metres. <b>Runway</b> <b>width</b> was also increased by 15 metres to 45 metres, making it {{capable of handling}} larger aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320.A new night landing system and airfield lighting system was installed along with modern Navigational aids.|$|E

40|$|Vertical-motion cues {{supplied}} by a g-seat to augment platform motion cues {{in the other}} five degrees of freedom were evaluated {{in terms of their}} effect on objective performance measures obtained during simulated transport landings under visual conditions. In addition to evaluating the effects of the vertical cueing, <b>runway</b> <b>width</b> and magnification effects were investigated. The g-seat was evaluated during fixed base and moving-base operations. Although performance with the g-seat only improved slightly over that with fixed-base operation, combined g-seat platform operation showed no improvement over improvement over platform-only operation. When one <b>runway</b> <b>width</b> at one magnification factor was compared with another width at a different factor, the visual results indicated that the <b>runway</b> <b>width</b> probably had no effect on pilot-vehicle performance. The new performance differences that were detected may be more readily attributed to the extant (existing throughout) increase in vertical velocity induced by the magnification factor used to change the <b>runway</b> <b>width,</b> rather than to the width itself...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} examine aspects of human visual perception during approaches to a runway. The <b>runway</b> <b>width</b> illusion has commonly been reported {{to contribute to the}} dangerous tendency of pilots to fly low approaches to runways that are wide and high approaches to runways that are narrow. Attempts to prevent the <b>runway</b> <b>width</b> illusion have not attempted to identify the ideal location for an indicator of altitude. Thus the present experiment examined the effect of varying <b>runway</b> <b>width</b> and manipulated scenes in order to determine whether the <b>runway</b> <b>width</b> illusion was present and where participants were focusing their attention in the scenes. Thirty-two non-pilot participants and 3 pilots took part in the experiment and viewed static and dynamic scenes of runways that were narrow (30. 48 m), medium (60. 96 m) or wide (91. 44 m) at one of three viewing heights low (30. 48 m), medium (45. 72 m) or high (60. 96 m). After viewing scenes, participants were required to estimate their altitude and aim-point. The results of this experiment revealed that participants were fairly inaccurate at estimating altitude and were inclined to overestimate aim-point, however the data also indicated that there was a robust <b>runway</b> <b>width</b> illusion that was present across static and dynamic trials and in both altitude and aim-point data. The standard marking on the runway in an attempt to prevent the <b>runway</b> <b>width</b> illusion was not effective at preventing incorrect altitude estimations but did assist participants to estimate aim-point. It was also found that the objects that participants' most commonly reported using to estimate altitude in the visual scene were located in the lower segment of the scenes...|$|E
50|$|Major {{construction}} on the base initially included a new 3000 m <b>runway</b> with a <b>width</b> of 45 m, as well as aprons and taxiways, a control tower, an Information Technology Wing building (which also houses flight simulator and mission simulator facilities), on-base accommodation and major renovation of the four existing hangars.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} 3 visual strategies for timing {{the initiation of}} the landing flare based on perceptions of either: (i) a critical height above ground level; (ii) a critical <b>runway</b> <b>width</b> angle (Y); or (iii) a critical time-to-contact (TTC) with the runway. Visual displays simulated landing approaches with trial-to-trial variations in glideslope, lighting, and scene detail. Twenty-four participants (8 private pilots, 8 student pilots and 8 non-pilots) were instructed to initiate the flare when they perceived that their TTC with the runway (30 m wide by 840 m long) had reached a critical value of 2 seconds. Our results demonstrated a significant effect of flight experience on flare timing accuracy and dominance of the height-based strategy over the runway-width-angle and TTC-based strategies...|$|E
40|$|Vortex wakes of {{aircraft}} pose a hazard to following aircraft until the energetic {{parts of their}} flow fields have decayed to a harmless level. It is suggested here that in-trail spacings between aircraft can be significantly and safely reduced by designing an individual, vortex-free flight corridor for each aircraft. Because each aircraft will then have its own flight corridor, which is free of vortex wakes while in use by the assigned aircraft, the time intervals between aircraft operations can be safely reduced {{to the order of}} seconds. The productivity of airports can then be substantially increased. How large the offset distances between operational corridors need to be to have them vortex free, and how airports need to be changed to accommodate an individual flight-corridor process for landing and takeoff operations, are explored. Estimates are then made of the productivity of an individual flight-corridor system {{as a function of the}} in-trail time interval between operations for various values of wake decay time, <b>runway</b> <b>width,</b> and the velocity of a sidewind. The results confirm the need for short time intervals between aircraft operations if smaller offset distances and increased productivity are to be achieved...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} growth and local advancement require increasing development of local infrastructure, including the air transportation. Selaparang airport in the Province of West Nusa Tenggara apparently has technical limitations for airside and landside development. Therefore, the local government and PT. Angkasa Pura I have formulated a policy to relocate a new airport with International standard, {{which is to be}} known as Lombok International Airport (BIL), to replace the Selaparang airport. Data used for the airport reconstruction analysis consisted of technical facilities required for the airside such as runway, taxiway and apron. The International Coorperation Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Federal Aviation Association (FAA) method were used reffering to Boeing Characteristic Airplane and the apron formulation capacity at peak time based on Japan International Coorperation Agency (JICA). Results of the analysis showed that the the reconstruction Phase I and Phase II of planned Lombok International Airport were classified as 4 C and 4 E, with 11 and 31 runways, respectively based on the ICAO standard by 2028. These figures were in accordance to the results of windrose analysis on system of up to 95 % direction site USAbility factor. The planned airplanes using the airside facilty on Phase I were B 737 - 400 and MD 82 and B 747 - 400 on Phase II. The required length for runway of phase I is 3000 m, 4000 m for phase II, and 45 m <b>runway</b> <b>width</b> using the MTOW value. The taxiway dimension analysis was based on ICAO, FAA and Boeing Characteristic Airplane and resulted in 15 m taxiway for phase I and 23 m phase II. The analysis was divided into three analyses.

40|$|Aerial {{refueling}} {{technology for}} both manned and unmanned aircraft {{is critical for}} operations where extended aircraft flight time is required. Existing refueling assets are typically manned aircraft, which couple to a second aircraft {{through the use of}} a refueling boom. Alignment and mating of the two aircraft continues to rely on human control with use of high-resolution cameras. With the recent advances in unmanned aircraft, it would be highly advantageous to remove/reduce human control from the refueling process, simplifying the amount of remote mission management and enabling new operational scenarios. Existing aerial refueling uses a camera, making it non-autonomous and prone to human error. Existing commercial localizer technology has proven robust and reliable, but not suited for aircraft-to-aircraft approaches like in aerial refueling scenarios since the resolution is too coarse (approximately one meter). A localizer approach system for aircraft-to-aircraft docking can be constructed using the same modulation with a millimeterwave carrier to provide high resolution. One technology used to remotely align commercial aircraft on approach to a runway are ILS (instrument landing systems). ILS have been in service within the U. S. for almost 50 years. In a commercial ILS, two partially overlapping beams of UHF (109 to 126 MHz) are broadcast from an antenna array so that their overlapping region defines the centerline of the runway. This is called a localizer system and is responsible for horizontal alignment of the approach. One beam is modulated with a 150 -Hz tone, while the other with a 90 -Hz tone. Through comparison of the modulation depths of both tones, an autopilot system aligns the approaching aircraft with the runway centerline. A similar system called a glide-slope (GS) exists in the 320 -to- 330 MHz band for vertical alignment of the approach. While this technology has been proven reliable for millions of commercial flights annually, its UHF nature limits its ability to operate beyond the 1 -to- 2 -meter precisions associated with commercial <b>runway</b> <b>width.</b> A prototype ILS-type system operates at millimeter-wave frequencies to provide automatic and robust approach control for aerial refueling. The system allows for the coupling process to remain completely autonomous, as a boom operator is no longer required. Operating beyond 100 GHz provides enough resolution and a narrow enough beamwidth that an approach corridor of centimeter scales can be maintained. Two modules were used to accomplish this task. The first module is a localizer/glide-slope module that can be fitted on a refueling aircraft. This module provides the navigation beams for aligning the approaching aircraft. The second module is navigational receiver fitted onto the approaching aircraft to be re fueled that can detect the approach beams. Since unmanned aircraft have a limited payload size and limited electrical power, the receiver portion was implemented in CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) technology based on a super-regenerative receiver (SRR) architecture. The SRR achieves mW-level power consumption and chip sizes less than l mm 2. While super-regenerative techniques have small bandwidths that limit use in communication systems, their advantages of high sensitivity, low complexity, and low power make them ideal in this situation where modulating tones of less than 1 kHz are used...|$|E

50|$|This {{illusion}} {{may make}} a pilot change (increase or decrease) the slope of their final approach.

The much wider runway would give the pilot the mental picture of {{the point where they}} would usually begin the flare, when they are much higher than they should be.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{approaches to}} evaluation of commercial Spaceports solutions, starting from specific customer needs {{and related to}} the case of a small reusable vehicle able to carry people or microgravity payloads on parabolic flights to 100 Km of altitude. The approach to the Spaceport evaluation and selection is based on the vehicle concept and associated technologies, {{as well as on the}} spacecraft reference mission scenario, in particular takeoff, landing and trajectory. With the aid of a proper functional analysis and concept of operations, specific requirements to the Spaceports capabilities will be derived for the selected reference mission, with emphasis to launch and landing operations (<b>runway,</b> length, <b>width),</b> location, climate, proximity of alternate landing sites, handling, use, storage and transportation of propellants, layout, safety. For the selected test case, rather than designing a brand new Spaceport, the used approach will start from the assessment of specific existing sites and infrastructures, and will eventually identify follow on upgrades to fulfill the relevant mission requirements, including some preliminary contingency scenarios during operations that may be driving specific Spaceport requirements. Also, new concepts of spaceports will be evaluated to enhance operations flexibility for commercial purposes, which include sea and land based configurable platforms for VTOL Operations and associated infrastructures. The approach to the development of the Spaceports Safety analysis, of a proper Safety Risk Management and the operations integration within the applicable National Regulatory system and requirements will also be evaluated, in accordance with the relevant mission requirements. The application of Safety analysis and in general of the safety criteria will be paramount in the assessment of existing infrastructures and in the identification of requirements to possible modifications and enhancement of specific capabilities. In particular, Safety Assessment will take into account the Spaceport existing layout, with reference to the closest populated area and traffic road, for the definition of minimum distance related to the use and storage of propellants or explosives needed for the spaceplane. The Spaceports evaluation will include a preliminary definition of the concept of a Ground Segment that provides the functionalities to support the reference mission both on ground and on flight. Ground Segment includes the ground facilities and tools that support the operations at the Spaceports, the Mission Control Center, and the Ground Stations to track the vehicle trajectory with the associated communication approach. Further considerations on future market trends will also be developed...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 33 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 7 - 10 July 2014 "Leading Transport into the Future", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. In the past airfields were designed and built by architectural and engineering companies without due regard and consideration to flight operational requirements. This deficiency was recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Federation of Air Line Pilots (IFALPA). Both leading aviation controlling bodies advocated the incorporation of flight operational considerations in the overall airfield layout and pavement design. Pertinent issues {{to be addressed in}} the paper include: approach light system design and consideration, aircraft maneuvering area design and construction, taxiway and runway markings, runway skid resistance, <b>runway</b> length and <b>width</b> consideration, <b>runway</b> end safety area (RESA) and safety strip considerations, rapid exit taxiway designs, apron lighting, taxiway design consideration and control over foreign object debris (FOD). Some case studies (e. g. King Shaka International Airport, OR Tambo International Airport, Lanseria International, Arusha and Mwanza Regional Airports, East London, Nairobi and Kilimanjaro International Airports) will be used to illustrate that by proper consideration to the flight operations factor, these airports could have been planned and designed/upgraded/maintained in a much more efficient and safe manner, that could have ensured an increased availability factor. Major high risk pavement failures have been recorded (asphalt surfacing being blown out and loose stones) by not considering aircraft related factors (jet blast, oil spillages).
