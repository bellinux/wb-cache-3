5|$|<b>Rocket</b> <b>Science</b> premiered on January 19, 2007 at the Sundance Film Festival and was theatrically {{released}} on August 10. It {{was not a}} financial success, earning only US$756,000 from its $4.5 million budget, though it was well-received by critics. Reviewers praised Thompson and Kendrick's performances and the film's parallels to real life; others believed that the film was deliberately quirky and forgettable. It was nominated for Sundance's Dramatic Grand Jury Prize and three Independent Spirit Awards. Though it failed to win any of the Grand Jury Prizes at Sundance, Blitz won its Dramatic Directing Award.|$|E

The Ages Michael Dwyer described it as [...] "a refinement of a unique sonic formula that read something like this: schlock-horror/weird sci-fi films plus obscure garage-punk music plus massive vintage keyboard contraption complete with theremin equals Rocket Science." [...] Carmine Pascuzzi of MediaSearch opined that [...] "it shows good improvement - showcasing powerful rock and electronic grooves. They give a genuine tilt at the rock 'n' roll styling" [...] where the group [...] "demonstrates a purpose and ambition in delivering some infectious tracks.

25|$|Goddard's work as both theorist and {{engineer}} anticipated many of {{the developments}} that were to make spaceflight possible. He {{has been called the}} man who ushered in the Space Age. Two of Goddard's 214 patented inventions—a multi-stage rocket (1914), and a liquid-fuel rocket (1914)—were important milestones toward spaceflight. His 1919 monograph A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes {{is considered one of the}} classic texts of 20th-century <b>rocket</b> <b>science.</b> Goddard successfully applied three-axis control, gyroscopes and steerable thrust to rockets to effectively control their flight.|$|E

40|$|An {{attitude}} reconstruction algorithm {{has been}} developed for a flexible sounding rocket whose spin vector nutates unstably about its minor inertia axis. This algorithm deduces attitude for use in post-flight analysis of the sounding <b>rocket's</b> <b>science</b> data. An additional motive for pursuing this work has been {{to show that a}} flexible-body dynamic model {{can be used in a}} Kalman filter/smoother-type attitude estimation system. The attitude reconstruction algorithm is a squareroot information filter/smoother. It uses a dynamic model of the rocket that includes a main rigid body and a flexure mode for a pair of elastic booms. Boom bending is the principal cause of the energy loss that leads to unstable growth of the nutations. The flexure of the booms is modeled by a Markov process, but the laws of mechanics are used to model the flexure's influence on the attitude dynamics of the main spacecraft body. The filter/smoother achieves an attitude accuracy that is significantly better than can be achieved using a rigid-body model. The peak attitude error is estimated to be 4 deg, and the majority of the error seems to be caused by the limited accuracy of the rocket's attitude sensors...|$|R
25|$|In his sculpture, he digs through sources {{ranging from}} other art and other genres (most notably Feynman diagrams), to flea markets, nuclear power plants, and fields of grass. He is {{in search of}} forms and ideas from which to build models, table pieces, and {{occasionally}} larger landscape pieces. Even some nominally finished, large scale works are reworked heavily. But at the same time, some random sculptural equivalents of brush strokes or artifacts of a piece's former life are retained, a degree of wabi-sabi, as {{may be seen in}} <b>Rocket</b> <b>Science</b> (circa 2006–9, Hogpen Hill, Connecticut).|$|E
25|$|Smaller bombs {{meant that}} bombers could carry more of them, {{and also that}} they could be carried on the new {{generation}} of rockets in development in the 1950s and 1960s. U.S. <b>rocket</b> <b>science</b> received a large boost in the postwar years, largely with the help of engineers acquired from the Nazi rocketry program. These included scientists such as Wernher von Braun, who had helped design the V-2 rockets the Nazis launched across the English Channel. An American program, Project Paperclip, had endeavored to move German scientists into American hands (and away from Soviet hands) and put them to work for the U.S.|$|E
25|$|The {{first such}} game created {{in this fashion}} is Escape Goat 2, the sequel to Escape Goat, by MagicalTimeBean. This {{included}} a humorous video introducing both the game and Double Fine's program, which was filmed {{during the week of}} the 2014 Game Developers Conference in March 2014. For the second title, Last Life by <b>Rocket</b> <b>Science</b> Amusements, Double Fine helped to prepare and present a Kickstarter campaign to help funding the final development of the title. The third title announced under this program was Mountain by David OReilly, a procedural terrarium that provides an ambient, minimalist, zen-like experience full of secrets and mysteries. In August 2014, Double Fine announced that a fourth game would be released under the program, the multiplayer beat 'em up Gang Beasts by Boneloaf, which launched into Steam Early Access on August 29, 2014. The latest addition to the Double Fine Presents program is GNOG by KO_OP, a puzzle adventure to be released in 2016.|$|E
500|$|Reece Thompson plays Hal Hefner, a shy fifteen-year-old {{student at}} Plainsboro High School, New Jersey with a {{pronounced}} stutter. Beginning in late 2004, <b>Rocket</b> <b>Sciences</b> producers traveled to several American and Canadian cities {{looking for an}} actor to play the lead role of Hal. At one point, Carter Jenkins was set to play Hal, but NBC blocked this as he was contracted for further episodes of Surface. HBO Films told the producers {{after six months of}} searching for a Hal that it would abandon the project if a lead actor was not found in two weeks, at which point a desperate Jeffrey Blitz watched all of the unsolicited audition tapes that he had been sent and [...] "knew immediately we had a promising candidate" [...] when he saw Thompson's tape. Although a casting call was originally posted for a teenage boy aged 13–18 who had a stutter and could also act, Thompson had previously been taught how to stutter. However Blitz wanted Hal to stutter in a different style, knowing he was going to block up on a particular word and looking for ways to work round it. Before filming, Thompson was taught this specific style by a speech pathologist.|$|R

500|$|Film critic Justin Chang, {{writing for}} Variety, {{summarized}} {{the film as}} [...] "eloquent about love, self-realization and adolescent angst". The main theme addressed in <b>Rocket</b> <b>Science</b> is Hal's coming of age, which is portrayed both by his understanding of love and finding his voice. The film takes its title from Hal's closing quote that understanding life and love [...] "shouldn't be rocket science".|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were less}} positive. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly graded <b>Rocket</b> <b>Science</b> as a C, calling the film [...] "one of those terminally annoying, depressive-yet-coy Sundance faves {{in which the}} tale of a mopey teen misfit unfolds behind a hard candy shell of irony". David Cornelius of DVD Talk criticized the film's phoniness and {{deliberate}} quirkiness. He was impressed by Thompson's portrayal of Hal, [...] "bursting with authenticity", but wrote that the supporting characters [...] "never have the chance to ring true" [...] in a cast [...] "overflowing with unnecessary hokey colorfulness". Online film critic for ReelViews James Berardinelli called the film [...] "moderately uplifting but not especially memorable" [...] and claimed that [...] "the problem with <b>Rocket</b> <b>Science</b> is that the character {{at the center of the}} drama isn't very energetic or, truth be told, interesting." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips, who gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, felt that it [...] "doesn't quite work" [...] and [...] "the spark goes out of the writing" [...] when Hal seeks out Ben in Trenton.|$|E

5000|$|The {{success of}} Oboler's 1942-1943 Lights Out revival {{was part of}} a trend in 1940s American radio toward more horror. Genre series like Inner Sanctum, Suspense and others drew {{increasingly}} large ratings. Perhaps with this in mind, NBC broadcast another Lights Out revival series from New York in the summer of 1945, using seven of Wyllis Cooper's original 1930s scripts. Like Oboler's, this revival aired in the early evening and not late at night, and because of this, it was reported, [...] "only those Cooper scripts which stressed fantasy rather than horror" [...] were broadcast. These included a bloodless ghost story about a man who accidentally condemns his dead wife to haunt a nearby cemetery and [...] "The <b>Rocket</b> Ship", <b>science</b> fiction involving interstellar travel. Cooper, then an advertising executive at New York's Compton Agency, may have had little or {{nothing to do with the}} actual broadcasts other than allowing his scripts to be performed.|$|R
500|$|<b>Rocket</b> <b>Science</b> was {{nominated}} for three Independent Spirit Awards, in the categories of [...] "Best First Feature", [...] "Best First Screenplay" [...] (Jeffrey Blitz) and [...] "Best Supporting Female" [...] (Anna Kendrick), but failed to win any.

[...] "Nick takes his work very seriously—it's an approach that's very much like Ben, in my mind," [...] said Blitz of D'Agosto, calling his performance [...] "just right". D'Agosto joked about his being cast as a high school student, having been cast as a student previously in Election, which was released eight years before <b>Rocket</b> <b>Science,</b> in 1999. Like Kendrick, D'Agosto had to learn a number of debating techniques to prepare for his role.|$|E
500|$|Vincent Piazza plays Earl Hefner, Hal's obsessive-compulsive, kleptomaniacal older brother. Vincent Piazza was {{studying}} at the New York acting school where <b>Rocket</b> <b>Science</b> casting sessions were being held; {{he decided to}} audition {{and was one of}} the first actors to be cast. When he first auditioned, he spoke with a lisp, said Blitz: [...] "I eventually decided to do away with the lisp—one major speech impediment per family is plenty—but kept many of the rest of the choices Vince brought to Earl." [...] Blitz cited Piazza's portrayal of Earl as an example of [...] "the strong choices that actors make in interpreting their character".|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since the}} first <b>rocket</b> entered space, <b>science</b> and {{technology}} have become the obsessions of the 20 th century. With their aid it seems possible that man can discover his own origins and learn {{the history of the}} cosmos.

As well as the creation myths, there are radically opposing theories of the world's origin. Some hold the "big bang" theory, by which the world began in a fiery cataclysm and might disapear again in an equally spectacular crash. Others believe that the universe is infinite and always the same. This is a tribute to the human beings who, with the help of science, might eventually reach the truth...|$|R
5|$|Due {{to reduced}} {{interest}} in his pre-war work, Coggins applied for a position teaching watercolor at Hunter College. He taught watercolor painting there from 1948 to 1952. In New York, {{as a result of}} his friendship with Fletcher Pratt, Coggins was introduced to the members of the Hydra Club, where he met Judith Merril and L. Ron Hubbard. Coggins was also invited to join Pratt's Trap Door Spiders club, where he became closely associated with L. Sprague de Camp and Isaac Asimov. The contact with such visionary thinkers complimented his exposure to the German V-2 rockets in Europe and served to strengthen his growing interest in space travel, <b>rockets,</b> and <b>science</b> fiction. In 1951 and 1952, Coggins collaborated again with Fletcher Pratt on two classic books: Rockets, Jets, Guided Missiles & Space Ships, and By Space Ship to the Moon. The books were released amidst the great wave of interest in space travel sweeping the United States and the rest of the world in the 1950s, and they were published in several countries and translated into other languages. These books made the prospect of space exploration seem a practical possibility. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientists used the books to demonstrate their ideas to Congressmen when seeking funding for the space program, and there are many NASA scientists today who retain fond memories of the influence the books had on their careers.|$|R
