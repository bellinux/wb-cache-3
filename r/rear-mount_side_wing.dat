The side strakes sometimes referred to as [...] "cheese graters" [...] or [...] "egg slicers," [...] that spanned from the doors to the rear fenders were needed for rules in several countries outlawing large openings on cars. The Testarossa had twin radiators in the back with the engine instead of a single radiator up-front. In conjunction the strakes provided cool air to the <b>rear-mounted</b> <b>side</b> radiators, thus keeping the engine from overheating. The strakes also made the Testarossa wider at the rear than in the front, thus increasing stability and handling.|$|R
