40|$|Aims. During {{the solar}} minimum of 2008, {{the value of}} total solar {{irradiance}} at 1 AU (TSI) was more than 0. 2 Wm − 2 lower than during the last minimum in 1996, indicating {{for the first time}} a directly observed long-term change. On the other hand, chromospheric indices and hence solar UV irradiance do not exhibit a similar change. Methods. Comparison <b>of</b> <b>TSI</b> with other activity parameters indicates that only the open solar magnetic field, BR, observed from satellites at 1 AU show a similar long-term behaviour. The values at the minima correlate well and the linear fit provides a direct physical relationship between TSI and BR during the minimum times. Results. This correlation allows an unambiguous reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>TSI</b> back in time, provided the open solar magnetic field can be determined from e. g. geomagnetic indices or cosmogenic radionucleides. Since the solar UV irradiance has no long-term trend, the mechanism for the secular change <b>of</b> <b>TSI</b> must differ from the effect of surface magnetism, as manifested by sunspots, faculae, and network which indeed explain well the intra-cycle variability of both total and spectral irradiance. Conclusions. The long-term trend <b>of</b> <b>TSI</b> is most probably caused by a global temperature change of the Sun that does not influence the UV irradiance in the same way as the surface magnetic fields...|$|R
40|$|Aims. The {{existing}} {{records of}} total solar irradiance (TSI) since 1978 differ {{not only in}} absolute values, but also show different trends. For the study <b>of</b> <b>TSI</b> variability these records need to be combined and three composites have been devised; however, the results depend on {{the choice of the}} records and the way they are combined. A new composite should be based on all existing records with an individual qualification. It is proposed to use a time-dependent uncertainty for weighting of the individual records. 				 					Methods. The determination of the time-dependent deviation <b>of</b> the <b>TSI</b> records is performed by comparison with the square root of the sunspot number (SSN). However, this correlation is only valid for timescales of the order of a year or more because TSI and SSN react quite differently to solar activity changes on shorter timescales. Hence the results concern only periods longer than the one-year-low-pass filter used in the analysis. 				 					Results. Besides the main objective to determine an investigator-independent uncertainty, the comparison <b>of</b> <b>TSI</b> with √SSN {{turns out to be a}} powerful tool for the study <b>of</b> the <b>TSI</b> long-term changes. The correlation <b>of</b> √SSN with <b>TSI</b> replicates very well the TSI minima, especially the very low value of the recent minimum. The results of the uncertainty determination confirm not only the need for adequate corrections for degradation, but also show that a rather detailed analysis is needed. The daily average <b>of</b> all <b>TSI</b> values available on that day, weighted with the correspondingly determined uncertainty, is used to construct a “new” composite, which, overall, compares well with the Physikalisch-Meteorologisches Observatorium Davos (PMOD) composite. Finally, the TSI − √SSN comparison proves to be an important diagnostic tool not only for estimating uncertainties of observations, but also for a better understanding of the long-term variability <b>of</b> <b>TSI...</b>|$|R
40|$|Aims: We {{characterize}} the solar rotational modulations of spectral solar irradiance (SSI) and {{compare them with}} the corresponding changes of total solar irradiance (TSI). Solar rotational modulations <b>of</b> <b>TSI</b> and SSI at wavelengths between 120 and 1600  nm are identified over one hundred Carrington rotational cycles during 2003 – 2013. 				 					Methods: The SORCE (Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment) and TIMED (Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics) /SEE (Solar EUV Experiment) measured and SATIRE-S modeled solar irradiances are analyzed using the EEMD (Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition) method to determine the phase and amplitude of 27 -day solar rotational variation in TSI and SSI. 				 					Results: The mode decomposition clearly identifies 27 -day solar rotational variations in SSI between 120 and 1600  nm, {{and there is a}} robust wavelength dependence in the phase of the rotational mode relative to that <b>of</b> <b>TSI.</b> The rotational modes of visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) are in phase with the mode <b>of</b> <b>TSI,</b> but the phase of the rotational mode of ultraviolet (UV) exhibits differences from that <b>of</b> <b>TSI.</b> While it is questionable that the VIS to NIR portion of the solar spectrum has yet been observed with sufficient accuracy and precision to determine the 11 -year solar cycle variations, the temporal variations over one hundred cycles of 27 -day solar rotation, independent of the two solar cycles in which they are embedded, show distinct solar rotational modulations at each wavelength...|$|R

40|$|Aone-dimensional radiative–convective equilibriummodel {{is used to}} {{investigate}} the influence of clouds on the onset of a runaway greenhouse under strong solar forcing. By comparing experiments with clear-sky conditions (clouds are transparent to radiation) to experiments with full-sky conditions (clouds are radiatively active), the authors find that the critical solar irradiance {{that is necessary to}} trigger a runaway greenhouse is increased from around 1. 15 – 1. 20 times the present-day total solar irradiance (TSI) on Earth S 0 for clear-sky conditions to around 1. 40 – 1. 45 S 0 for full-sky conditions.
