40|$|Problem: Incident {{investigation}} reports do {{not usually}} contain {{enough information to}} aid in studying boom arm vertical speed for roof bolting machines to determine the impact that appendage speed had on an operator's risk of experiencing a contact. Laboratory experiments with human subjects are also not feasible because of safety and ethical issues. Method Researchers successfully developed a three-dimensional computer model that uses virtual human simulation software as the primary means to gather contact data when the boom arm touches the operator's hand, arm, head, or leg. Results: Data analysis of <b>roof</b> <b>bolter</b> simulations shows that {{the speed of the}} boom arm is {{the most important factor in}} determining the risk of an operator making contact. Regardless of other variables, contact incidents were always greater when the bolter arm was moving up, greater on the hand, and greater for the boom arm part of the machine. The reason why the subject experiences more contacts when the boom arm is moving up rather than down is that more risky behaviors occur during drilling and bolting when the boom arm is ascending. Based on the data collected, boom speeds greater than 13 in/sec result in a substantial increase in risk to the <b>roof</b> <b>bolter</b> operator of making contact. Speeds less than or equal to 13 in/sec are associated with a more modest relative risk of making contact, which represents a decrease in potential hazard.

40|$|Roof bolting {{typically}} {{follows the}} extraction of a commodity {{to help keep the}} roof from collapsing.

S. <b>roof</b> <b>bolter</b> fatal and nonfatal lost-time injury data at underground work locations for all commodities from 2004 through 2013 and determines risk indices for six roof bolting tasks. For fatal and nonfatal incidences combined, the roof bolting tasks in order of the highest to lowest risk index were bolting, handling of materials, setting the temporary roof support (TRS), drilling, tramming, and traversing. For fatalities, the roof bolting tasks in order of the highest to lowest risk index were handling of materials, setting the TRS, bolting, drilling, traversing, and tramming. Age was found to be a significant factor. Severity of injury, indicated by days lost, was found to increase with increasing age as well as with increasing experience, largely due to the confounding of age and experience. The operation of the roof bolting machine used in underground mining should be a research priority given the high frequency and severity of incidents. The results also suggest that temporal factors may exist, so additional research is warranted to better understand these factors and potentially develop interventions.

40|$|AbstractDespite recent {{advances}} in mine health and safety, roof collapse and instabilities are still the leading causes of injury and fatality in underground mining operations. Improving safety and optimum design of ground support requires good and reliable ground characterization.

The actual measurements on the samples of the roof and wall strata from the exploration boring are reliable but the related holes are far apart, thus unsuitable for design purposes. The best source of information could be the geological back mapping of the roof and walls, but this is disruptive to mining operations, and provided information is only from rock surface.

40|$|In This Chapter [Drilling, blasting, and crushers Diesel {{particulate}} Enclosed cabs Ventilation with jet fans Stopping construction methods Propeller fans as main fans] This chapter {{explains how}} to control dust in large-entry stone mines, including both silica dust and diesel particulate. Most stone mines are limestone mines, but a substantial minority are marble, sandstone, and granite mines. These mines differ from most others in that entry widths are 30 ft or more and entry heights are 25 ft or more. Such mines, developed with room-and-pillar methods, have large open areas that can make ventilation and dust control more difficult. Because {{of the difficulty of}} ventilating stone mines, improved ventilation is a major focal point of this chapter. However, the chapter also covers the control of dust from drills, blasting, and crushers. Another part of the chapter covers enclosed cabs, an effective dust control technique for some workers. BACKGROUND The major dust compliance problem in stone mines is caused by silica (quartz) in the rock. Mines in high-silica rock, 8 % or more, {{are far more likely to}} have a dust problem than those where there is less silica. Geographically, the limestone in the Northeastern and South Central United States has higher silica than the rest of the country. Chekan and Colinet [2002] have analyzed Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) dust sampling results [MSHA 2001] from the stone industry. They have concluded that, on average across the United States, the workers exposed to the highest dust concentrations are rotary drill operators, front-end loader operators, truck drivers, and crusher operators. However, there are many regional differences. Also, occupations that work outside of cabs, such as blasters, <b>roof</b> <b>bolters,</b> and laborers, can be exposed to high dust levels...|$|R

In the absence of detailed demographic data for the mining industry, the current study uses injury and illness data reported to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) to examine differences, over time and by commodity, in the proportions of injured or ill workers aged 45 years and older. These data indicate that from 1988 to 1998, the percentage of injured or ill older workers (aged 45 years and older) have been steadily increasing. The most notable increase occurred at coal mining operations where the proportion of injured/ill older workers increased from 24 to 44 percent. A more detailed breakdown of the industry by commodity for 1998 showed the highest proportions of older injured/ill workers (over 40 %) occurring in coal, iron ore, alumina mills, cement, and trona operations. In coal operations, as the employment size of the mine operation increased, so did its proportion of older injured/ill workers. Also, higher proportions of older injured/ill workers were observed at surface coal work locations than at underground locations. The distribution of older injured/ill miners by occupation for several select commodities shows the highest proportions for supervisors, electricians, mechanics, and surface equipment operators, and the lowest proportions for surface laborers and for underground coal <b>roof</b> <b>bolters</b> and scoop operators. With few exceptions, older injured workers have the highest median number of days lost per injury when examined by type of mining operation and by occupation.

Nonfatal disabling injury rates were determined for the 5 year period from 1990 to 1994. Details regarding the populations of the mines {{included in the analysis}} and the demographics of injured miners were described. A total of 22, 607 underground nonfatal injuries which had corresponding seam height information were reported to the MSHA over the study period; 91. 6 % of these were due to handling materials, machinery, powered haulage, slip or fall of person, fall of mine roof, and/or nonpowered hand tools. The strongest relationship between seam height and injury rates was seen for walking/running and crawling/kneeling activities. Accidents involving load, haul, and dump types of powered haulage equipment demonstrated the most consistent trend in injury rates associated with differences in seam height. Injury rates declined as seam height increased for all mine types for these types of accidents. The lowest rates of injuries involving shuttle cars and the highest rates of injuries involving powered haulage conveyors were observed in low seams across all mine sizes. Fatal and non fatal injury rates for machinery accidents involving <b>roof</b> <b>bolters</b> and nonfatal injuries resulting from falls of roof were lowest in high seam mines, {{with the exception of the}} largest mines. Nonfatal disabling injury rates for material handling accidents and injury rates for accidents involving powered haulage locomotives were greater in larger mines.

40|$|Identifying the {{properties}} of overlying rocks in underground mining operations is important to ensure the appropriate roof support design is used to maintain stability of the mine entries. Recently J. H. Fletcher & Co. developed a monitoring and control system for <b>roof</b> <b>bolters</b> for the underground mining industry. The system records the drilling parameters used during roof bolt drilling and the information can {{provide insight into the}} physical properties of the roof strata. The parameters include thrust, rotational speed, torque and velocity and the measurements are collected every 0. 1 second during the operation. The drilling parameters were analyzed to determine the application of identifying the strength of rocks being drilled from the measurements. The data was converted into the specific energy of drilling which {{is a measure of the}} amount of energy required for removing a given unit of rock during a drilling operation. The laboratory studies completed to date indicate a fairly high correlation between the specific energy of drilling and the unconfined compressive strength of :he rocks that were drilled. Additionally, the drilling parameters were shown to be effective for identifying the presence of fractures or bed separations between rock layers. The thrust, torque and specific energy of drilling were all good indicators for identifying the fractures or separations. Regardless of the drilling parameters used during the drilling experiments, the location of the fractures were identified. In order to determine the application of the drilling parameters for identifying roof rock properties, two series of experiments were conducted. The first series of experiments used three "manufactured" roof layers that had various rock samples embedded in concrete blocks. The rock samples included three types of sandstone, marble, and argillite. Another concrete block was poured with foam inserts to simulate large bedding separations (2 to 8 -in). Two other manufactured blocks were constructed using high-strength concrete with cardboard layers embedded to simulate smaller fractures or bedding separations. The size of the cardboard layers varied from 1 / 8 - to 1 -in thick. One of the blocks had the cardboard layers embedded at an inclined angle to determine the effect of the orientation on the drilling parameters. A series of experiments was conducted with the rotational speed and the penetration rate held constant and the thrust and torque allowed to vary.

The objective was to determine the impact of <b>roof</b> <b>bolter</b> machine appendage speed on the likelihood of the operator coming in contact with. A contact means two or more objects intersecting or touching each other, e. g., appendage makes contact with the operator 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s hand, arm, head or leg. Incident investigation reports do not usually contain enough information to aid in studying this problem and laboratory experiments with human subjects are also not feasible because of safety and ethical issues. As an alternative, researchers developed a computer model approach as the primary means to gather data. By simulating an operator 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s random behavior and machine 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s appendage velocity, researchers can study potential hazards of tasks where {{it is not possible to}} perform experiments with human subjects. Analysis information is helpful to the mining industry in terms of making recommendations that reduce the likelihood that roof-bolter operators experience injury due to contact with a moving boom. Data analysis of <b>roof</b> <b>bolter</b> simulations show that the virtual-operator 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s response time has little effect on the number of contacts experienced. Based on frequency and cross-tabulation, regardless of other variables, contact incidents were always greater when the boom was moving up, were always greater on the palm, and were always greater for the boom part of the machine. Also, regardless of boom speed, the 25 th-percentile-sized operators experienced more contacts than did other operator sizes. Furthermore, regardless of boom speed, the 152 -cm mine seam experienced more contacts than did other seam heights tested. Results of a survival analytic approach suggest that controlling the boom speed is the most important factor in determining the risk of an operator making contact. Based on the data collected, boom speed greater than 41 cm/s results in a substantial increase in risk to the <b>roof</b> <b>bolter</b> operator and should probably be avoided. At speeds less than or equal to 25 cm/s are associated with a more modest relative risk, which represents an acceptable level of risk. Also, at speeds between 25 and 41 cm/s, there could be a particular boom speed in this range at which a significant inflection point in the relative risk estimates occurs.

40|$|Significant strides {{have been}} made in {{optimizing}} the design of filtration and pressurization systems used on the enclosed cabs of mobile mining equipment to reduce respirable dust and provide the best air quality to the equipment operators. Considering all of the advances made in this area, one aspect that still needed to be evaluated was a comparison of the efficiencies of the different filters used in these systems. As high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filters provide the highest filtering efficiency, the general assumption would be that they would also provide the greatest level of protection to workers. Researchers for the U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) speculated, based upon a previous laboratory study, that filters with minimum efficiency reporting value, or MERV rating, of 16 may be a more appropriate choice than HEPA filters in most cases for the mining industry. A study was therefore performed comparing HEPA and MERV 16 filters on two kinds of underground limestone mining equipment, a <b>roof</b> <b>bolter</b> and a face drill, to evaluate this theory. Testing showed that, at the 95 -percent confidence level, there was no statistical difference between the efficiencies of the two types of filters on the two kinds of mining equipment. As the MERV 16 filters were less restrictive, provided greater airflow and cab pressurization, cost less and required less-frequent replacement than the HEPA filters, the MERV 16 filters were concluded to be the optimal choice for both the <b>roof</b> <b>bolter</b> and the face drill in this comparative-analysis case study. Another key finding of this study is the substantial improvement in the effectiveness of filtration and pressurization systems when using a final filter design.

Test conditions included using various combinations of rotational speeds and thrusts, using 2. 54 - and 3. 49 -mm- (1 - and 1 3 / 8 -in. -) diameter hexagonal and round drill steels, using vacuum and wet conditions and using drill media of differing compressive strengths. This paper details the affects {{of each of these}} variables on the performance and sound power level emission. When drilling into granite, it was found that wet drilling generated lower sound power levels and performed better than vacuum drilling...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{methods for}} limiting occupational silica exposures for roof bolting personnel in underground coal mining. A canopy air curtain and an air tube were evaluated as means to provide filtered air over the breathing zone of these personnel. Laboratory testing showed that dust reductions beneath the air curtain and air tube approached 60 percent and 40 percent, respectively, with low interference air velocities. The data {{also showed that}} dust reductions were highest for positions closest to the device and that these levels decreased with distance. This paper also evaluates a metal rake, a flexible insert, and a rigid insert for cleaning the <b>roof</b> <b>bolter</b> dust collector box. Less dust was produced when using the rigid insert. Surprisingly, the flexible insert was sometimes no better than scraping or raking the dust onto the mine floor. However, little dust got on the coveralls when using either of the inserts...|$|E
40|$|Testing of the <b>roof</b> <b>bolter</b> canopy {{air curtain}} (CAC) {{designed}} by the U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has gone through many iterations, demonstrating successful dust control performance under controlled laboratory conditions. J. H. Fletcher & Co., an original equipment manufacturer of mining equipment, further developed the concept by incorporating it into the design of its roof bolting machines. In the present work, laboratory testing was conducted, showing dust control efficiencies ranging from 17. 2 to 24. 5 percent. Subsequent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis revealed limitations in the design, and a potential improvement was analyzed and recommended. As a result, a new CAC design is being developed, incorporating {{the results of the}} testing and CFD analysis.

40|$|In {{response}} to the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, mandatory noise standards have been developed that specify time-noise limits of mine personnel exposure. Most affected by elevated noise levels is the pneumatic <b>roof</b> <b>bolter</b> operator, {{both in terms of}} levels near or in excess of 115 dbA and in terms of length of exposure. Therefore, the principal emphasis of this Bureau of Mines report is on pneumatic drill noise control. It is not the intent of this report to suggest any drill redesign; instead, methods are suggested to reduce the noise level by complementing existing machines. An integral muffler system and a separate muffler system were tested in an attempt to lower pneurnaric drill noise levels. Pneumatic drills, when new, operate at about 115 dbA when drilling in sandstone. Using the drill muffler systems, it was possible to decrease the noise level of a 115 -dbA s rope drill to approximately 100 dbA...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study to verify and validate a computer model that represents and analyzes motions and hazardous events in a simulated three dimensional workplace. The purpose of the computer model is to support research that is investigating the safe speed range for the vertical movement of <b>roof</b> <b>bolter</b> boom arms to reduce worker injuries in underground coal mines. The information obtained for this paper is based upon a project that is investigating means to reduce workers risks of injury from exposure to mining machinery. The methodology being employed by the project includes human factors design considerations, anthropometric modeling and simulation tools, laboratory validation, engineering interventions, and collaboration with industry and an equipment manufacturer. The results of this study were used to (1) determine the input parameters that are unique to the mining environment and needed to develop a credible, computer-based, human-machine interactive model, (2) develop test methods to measure the required parameters, and (3) to refine the human-machine interactive computer model...|$|E
30|$|MSHA {{studies have}} shown that roof bolting is one of the sources of high respirable quartz dust in {{underground}} coal mines (Schultz and Haney 2002). Over-exposure to quartz-rich dust could cause pneumoconiosis, silicosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) for underground coal miners (NIOSH 2011). To reduce the miners’ exposure to respirable dust, MSHA sets a dust standard to reduce the overall dust concentration limit from 2.0 to 1.5  mg/m 3 in the coal mine atmosphere during a working shift. This new standard will be effective on August 1, 2016. Between 2012 and 2014, MSHA collected 341, 788 miners’ dust samples both by mine operators and by inspectors (MSHA 2015). The analysis of the data shows that among all the samples 9060 are above the limit of 2.0  mg/m 3 while 18, 668 are above the 1.5  mg/m 3 new standard. It also shows that among the 23, 416 dust samples of <b>roof</b> <b>bolter</b> operators, 381 and 983 of them are above the 2.0 and 1.5  mg/m 3 standards, respectively.|$|E
30|$|Dust {{generated}} from bolt hole drilling in roof bolting operation could have high quartz content. As a dust control measure, vacuum drilling is employed {{on most of}} the roof bolters in US underground mines. However, fine rock particulates from drilling could escape from the dust collection system and become airborne under some circumstances causing the <b>roof</b> <b>bolter</b> operators expose to quartz-rich respirable dust. A previous research shows that drilling can be controlled through properly selected penetration and rotational rates to reduce the specific energy of drilling. Less specific energy means less energy is wasted on generating noise, heat and over-breakage of rock. It implies that proper control of drilling has a great potential to generate significantly less fine rock dust during drilling. The drilling experiments have been conducted to study the effect of controlling drilling on reducing respirable dust. The preliminary results show that the size distributions of respirable dust were different when controlling drilling in different bite depths. This paper presents the findings from laboratory experimental studies.|$|E
