40|$|Estimating {{discards}} is {{an important}} issue for ﬁsheries management so that total mortality caused by ﬁshing is considered. In 2003, a sampling programme addressing Iberian hake discards by the Portuguese ﬂeets was implemented according to the requirements of the European Commission Data Collection <b>Regulation</b> (<b>Reg.</b> EC No 1543 / 2000). A preliminary analysis of the data collected showed trip and haul duration to be potential sources of bias, because their relationship to discards per unit effort (DPUE) was not linear. This paper develops estimators for discards by weight using ﬁshing effort as auxiliary information, describes a jack-knife procedure to identify inﬂuential observations, applies the methodologies to Iberian hake as a case study and compares the results obtained by each estimator.

40|$|The EMAS <b>Regulation</b> (<b>Reg</b> 761 / 01 EC) is an EU {{scheme for}} the {{implementation}} of an Environmental Management System (EMS) by any organization, implemented by the European Commission since the year 1993. The EMS has been originally proposed both by the European Commission and by ISO as the frontrunner of a series of policy tools that were conceived to enable companies to simultaneously pursue environmental objectives and competitive targets (in a synergetic way). Based on the unique dataset of the EVER project, this paper investigates whether or not an EMS implemented within the EMAS Regulation has an effect on firm performance both from an environmental and a competitive point of view. The econometric analysis shows a positive impact of well-designed environmental management system on environmental performance and, as a consequence, on technical and organizational innovations. Effects on other competitive variable as market performance, resource productivity and intangible asset are not strongly supported...|$|R
30|$|According to {{this point}} of view, the {{management}} of agro-silvo-pastoral systems should maintain an agronomic orientation while simultaneously taking into consideration the added value of quality foods and cultural uses of the land (Pardini 2007). On the basis of European <b>regulation</b> (<b>Reg.</b> CE 1257 / 1999 and later Reg. CE 1968 / 2005) Italy has passed laws that favoured landscape variability, complex agro-silvo-pastoral systems and in support of land use diversification through forms of service provision (Italian law 228 issued on 18 May 2001). Such regulation also provides support to integrated and organic agriculture {{with the aim of}} enhancing the management of the rural areas for environmental conservation, landscape beauty and conservation of biological diversity. The same directives have been acquired also in the Rural Development Plans approved by some regional governments. These changes in the national and regional legislation will promote the association of trees with pastures and cropped fields and, in turn, further favour the organisation of agro-silvo-pastoral systems.|$|R

Four sterol compounds were identified and characterized in the three oils which are, sitosterol always predominant (43 - 66 %), delta 5 -avenastérol (8 - 13 %), stigmasterol (≤ 1, 5 %) and campesterol (1 - 2 %); one methyl sterol (4 -methylsterol) : citrostadienol (4 - 7 %) and two triterpenic alcohols : 24 -methylene cycloartanol (10 - 33 %) and cycloartenol (3 - 13 %). These results vary according to campany and variety. Our study shows {{that most of these}} compounds were affected by climatic conditions especially during the campanies 2004 - 2005 and 2005 - 2006. The amounts of the four identified sterols are in agreement with the European <b>regulation</b> (<b>Reg.</b> (EEC) n° 2568 / 91, appendix 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Trypanosoma brucei, causing African sleeping-sickness, {{exploits}} quorum-sensing (QS) {{to generate}} the 'stumpy forms' necessary for the parasite's transmission to tsetse-flies. These quiescent cells are generated by differentiation in the bloodstream from proliferative slender forms. Using genome-wide RNAi selection we screened for repressors of transmission stage-enriched mRNAs in slender forms, using the stumpy-elevated ESAG 9 transcript as a model. This identified REG 9. 1, whose RNAi-silencing alleviated ESAG 9 repression in slender forms and tsetse-midgut procyclic forms. Interestingly, trypanosome surface protein Family 5 and Family 7 mRNAs were also elevated, which, like ESAG 9, are T. brucei specific and stumpy-enriched. We suggest these contribute to the distinct transmission biology and vector tropism of T. brucei from other African trypanosome species. As well as surface family <b>regulation,</b> <b>REG</b> 9. 1 -depletion generated QS-independent development to stumpy forms in vivo, whereas REG 9. 1 overexpression in bloodstream forms potentiated spontaneous differentiation to procyclic forms {{in the absence of}} an external signal. Combined, this identifies REG 9. 1 as a regulator of developmental cell fate, controlling the expression of Trypanosoma brucei-specific molecules elevated during transmission...|$|R

Both the initiatives, {{promoted by the}} San Michele al Tagliamento Municipality and the Colli Euganei Natural Park Administration, {{have been carried out}} with the Centro Studi Qualità Ambiente (Quality and Environmental Studies Centre, University of Padova) technical support and anticipated some novelties introduced by the last revision of the EMAS <b>Regulation</b> (<b>Reg.</b> CE n. 761 / 2001 – EMAS). For the first time problems related to the territorial application of an Environmental Management System were faced and overcome. The extension to a whole territory, in fact, is the peculiar feature of these two innovative projects: thanks to this solution it became possible to optimise the resources used in area environmental management, still satisfying all the stakeholders’ needs (citizens, business, local authorities, tourists). Early engage of diverse stakeholders (institutional and not) proved to be essential to the success of that kind of challenge. In june 2002 the European Commission awarded the Bibione Tourist Resort as a reference of excellent application of the EMAS Regulation in Europe...|$|R
