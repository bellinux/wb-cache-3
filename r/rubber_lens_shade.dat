50|$|A 28 mm f/2.8 shift lens with 67EW {{filter thread}} and a <b>lens</b> <b>shade</b> with filter holder for 74R rimless filters and M92x1.00 filter ring. Many user-changeable mechanically-only mount modules {{available}} from Schneider Kreuznach. Also available as Leica PC-Super-Angulon R 28 mm f/2.8 with Leica R mount. Can be modified from a shift-only lens to a tilt-only lens by the German company.|$|R
50|$|The lens was a fixed 25-50 mm f/4.5-16 manual focus zoom with macro {{focusing}} down to 11 in (280 mm). This gave a {{field of}} view range approximately equivalent to a 50-100 mm zoom lens on a 35 mm format camera. There was a built-in, pop out <b>lens</b> <b>shade.</b> The filter thread diameter was 40.5 mm. Minolta sold UV, yellow and 1B filters.|$|R
50|$|Lens hoods {{that are}} {{supplied}} by the manufacturer of the lens are often designed to fit onto the matching lens facing either forward, for normal use, or backwards, so that the hood may be stored with the lens without occupying much additional space. <b>Rubber</b> <b>lens</b> hoods are flexible and generally collapse for storage. However other lens hoods must be removed if these features are not available and length extension of the lens is not preferred during storage.|$|R
50|$|In {{his work}} as an amateur photographer, his {{photographs}} were widely published across Canada. He also corresponded with George Eastman, founder of the Eastman Kodak Company, about photographic technology, and published in photographic journals {{on the subject of}} technological innovation. He built his first camera out of a oblong box covered in black oil cloth, and went on to design and build such items of equipment as an exposure timing chart, a <b>lens</b> <b>shade,</b> and a fixing tank.|$|R
50|$|In photography, a {{lens hood}} or <b>lens</b> <b>shade</b> is a device {{used on the}} front end of a lens to block the Sun or other light source(s) to prevent glare and lens flare. Lens hoods may also be used to protect the lens from {{scratches}} and the elements without having to put on a lens cover.The geometry of a lens hood is dependent on three things: the focal length of the lens, the size of the front lens element and the dimensions of the image sensor or film in the camera.|$|R

50|$|The M145 Machine Gun Optic is {{a variant}} of the C79 that was {{developed}} for the U.S. Army and is commonly mounted on M240 and M249 machine guns. The M145 is unusual when compared with other optical sights in use with the United States military in that ballistic compensation is in the mount, rather than in the reticle. The reticle is illuminated by a battery-powered LED with varying intensity settings. The mount fits directly to any MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail or receiver. Zero is retained despite repeated removal and re-attachment to the weapon. The M145 is extremely resistant to shock and water immersion and has an anti-reflection device and <b>rubber</b> <b>lens</b> caps.|$|R

40|$|In this {{contribution}} it {{is argued}} that vision systems urgently require an open camera to lens communication standard. Traditional machine vision systems are built out of components that are manufactured by different vendors. New lens mounts with an open camera to lens communication standard would also allow machine vision systems to incorporate features that are already common in commercial products. This includes the automatic correction of various types of lens aberrations, including geometric distortion, lateral chromatic aberration, and <b>lens</b> <b>shading.</b> The lack of an open camera to lens communication standard is, however, an even more serious obstacle because modern techniques of computational imaging cannot find wide-spread application in machine vision systems. An open camera to lens communication standard opens up wide-range application to all kinds of computational imaging systems and the machine vision industry is well advised to implement such a standard...|$|R

40|$|The {{first phase}} of this project was {{completed}} in March 2000, and included the successful technology demonstration of a new ultralightweight photovoltaic concentrator array at the fully functional panel level. The new array is called the Stretched Lens Aurora (SLA) array, and uses deployable, flexible, thin-film silicone <b>rubber</b> Fresnel <b>lenses</b> to focus sunlight onto high efficiency multijunction solar cells, which are mounted to a composite radiator surface for waste heat dissipation. A prototype panel was delivered to NASA Marshall in March 2000, and comprised four side-by-side lenses focussing sunlight onto four side-by-side photovoltaic receivers. This prototype panel was tested by NASA Glenn prior to delivery to NASA Marshall. The best of the four lens/receiver modules achieved 27. 4 % efficiency at room temperature in the NASA Glenn solar simulator tests. This performance equates to 375 W/sq. m. areal power and 378 W/kg specific power at the fully functional panel level. We believe {{this to be the}} first space solar array of any kind to simulataneously meet the two long-standing NASA goals of 300 W/sq. m. and 300 W/kg at the functional panel level. Key results for the {{first phase of}} the program have been documented by ENTECH in a Draft Final Technical Report, which is presently being reviewed by NASA, and which should be published in the near future...|$|R
40|$|Intraocular {{pressure}} (IOP) is {{a primary}} indicative factor in the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of glaucoma. Measurement of IOP during conventional single office consultation is insufficient for determination of the pressure peak, and IOP profile is needed for peak determination. A capacitive wearable contact lens sensor for monitoring of the IOP is developed in this study. A curvature-sensitive inductor-capacitor sensor is fabricated and embedded inside a silicone <b>rubber</b> contact <b>lens,</b> such that the curvature of the lens is correlated with the resonance frequency of the sensor. The curvature of the lens is mechanically related to the IOP in the underlying eye such that the IOP can be determined from the resonance frequency of the sensor. To fit human eyes, the sensor was designed to have an outer diameter of 14 mm, radius of curvature of 8. 5 mm, and operates in human IOP range between 5 and 40 mm Hg. The frequency responses {{and the ability of}} the sensor to track IOP cycles were tested. Tests on model silicone eyes and enucleated porcine eyes showed that the sensors have a linearity R> 0. 997 and a sensitivity > 200 ppm/mmHg for IOP monitoring. Together with wireless reading circuitry taped around the eye socket, the new contact lens sensor can be used for continuous IOP monitoring in clinics and at home for determination of the peak IOP for use in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring.

5000|$|During an {{accidental}} radiation leak {{that ended in}} an explosion, the apparatus became fused to Otto Octavius's body. It was later revealed that the radiation (or possibly his own latent mutation) had mutated his brain {{so that he could}} control the movement of the arms using his thoughts alone. The tentacles have since been surgically removed from his body, although Octavius retains the power to control them telepathically from a great distance. The accident also seemingly damaged his brain (although it was later suggested that what was interpreted as brain damage was in fact his mind rewiring itself to accommodate four extra limbs), and the scientist turned to a life of crime, first taking the hospital hostage and calling himself [...] "Dr. Octopus" [...] from the derogatory name that his co-workers had given him. Though Doctor Octopus himself is portly, in poor physical shape, and is near-sighted, with his harness attached he is physically more than a match for Spider-Man. The accident also made his eyes very sensitive to light, requiring him to wear glasses with <b>shaded</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
40|$|Humankind {{has long}} {{endeavored}} {{to control the}} propagation direction of light. Since time immemorial, <b>shades,</b> <b>lenses</b> and mirrors {{have been used to}} control the flow of light. In modern society, with the rapid development of nanotechnology, the control of light is moving toward devices at micrometer and even nanometer scales. At such scales, traditional devices based on geometrical optics reach their fundamental direction limits and cease to work. Nano photonics, on the other hand, has attracted wide attention from researchers, especially in the last decade, due to its ability to manipulate light at the nanoscale. This review focuses on the nano photonics systems that aim to select light based on its propagation direction. In {{the first half of this}} review, we survey the literature and the current state of the art focused on enabling optical broadband angular selectivity. The mechanisms we review can be classified into three main categories: (i) microscale geometrical optics, (ii) multilayer birefringent materials and (iii) Brewster modes in plasmonic systems, photonic crystals and metamaterials. In the second half, we present two categories of potential applications for broadband angularly selective systems. The first category aims at enhancing the efficiency of solar energy harvesting, through photovoltaic process or solar thermal process. The second category aims at enhancing light extracting efficiency and detection sensitivity. Finally, we discuss the most prominent challenges in broadband angular selectivity and some prospects on how to solve these challenges. Comment: 14 page, 11 figure...|$|R
