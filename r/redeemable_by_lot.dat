In 1933, some of these notes, together with unissued notes dated 1926, were overstamped by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru with their values in soles.|$|R
50|$|On 6 June 1838, President José Ignacio de Márquez {{authorized}} the Treasury (la Tesorería General de la República) to issue notes <b>redeemable</b> <b>by</b> bearer at sight. They {{were to be}} accepted by all tax offices. Notes were to be issued for 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 75, 80, and 100 pesos, but this decree was revoked on 4 November 1846 by President Mosquera, and no notes were issued.|$|R

He exercised these powers with great reluctance. He was apprehensive of irritating the jealousy of military sway, prevalent throughout the country, and of corrupting the morals of the army.|$|R
5000|$|Regular {{warrants}} are <b>redeemable</b> <b>by</b> {{the government}} treasurer {{after they are}} issued. [...] "Registered warrants" [...] bear interest and need not be redeemed by the treasurer until the warrant maturity date. [...] If warrants cannot be immediately redeemed by the issuing entity, the collecting bank may accept the warrants as short term debt instruments and collect interest when redeemed in accordance with a prior agreement with the issuing entity. The collecting bank may refuse to accept a warrant issue, in which case other banks may also refuse to accept them.|$|R
25|$|Vanilla {{convertible}} bonds {{are the most}} plain convertible structures. They grant the holder the right to convert into {{a certain number of}} shares determined according to a conversion price determined in advance. They may offer coupon regular payments during the life of the security and have a fixed maturity date where the nominal value of the bond is <b>redeemable</b> <b>by</b> the holder. This type is the most common convertible type and is typically providing the asymmetric returns profile and positive convexity often wrongly associated to the entire asset class: at maturity the holder would indeed either convert into shares or request the redemption at par depending on whether or not the stock price is above the conversion price.|$|R
50|$|Huntingtower {{was educated}} at Eton, which he {{left at the}} age of seventeen. His father refused to grant him any {{allowance}} whatsoever, and he received from his family only a few hundred pounds from his grandmother in the next four years. Unfortunately, his status as the heir of a large estate allowed him to borrow immense sums, and he led so dissipated a life as to accumulate, by 1841, £220,000 of debt. Among these debts was one of over £19,050 to a London diamond dealer, Dobson. Accordingly, he conveyed to Dobson, for a payment of just under £950, his interest in the family estates and eight life insurance policies, to be <b>redeemable</b> <b>by</b> paying his debt of £20,000.|$|R

5000|$|Debt {{securities}} may {{be called}} debentures, bonds, deposits, notes or commercial paper depending on their maturity, collateral and other characteristics. The holder of a debt security is typically entitled to the payment of principal and interest, together with other contractual rights {{under the terms of}} the issue, such as the right to receive certain information. Debt securities are generally issued for a fixed term and <b>redeemable</b> <b>by</b> the issuer at the end of that term. Debt securities may be protected by collateral or may be unsecured, and, if they are unsecured, may be contractually [...] "senior" [...] to other unsecured debt meaning their holders would have a priority in a bankruptcy of the issuer. Debt that is not senior is [...] "subordinated".|$|R
5000|$|In 1944 in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, {{representatives from}} 44 nations met {{to develop a}} new {{international}} monetary system that {{came to be known as}} the Bretton Woods system. Conference members had hoped that this new system would “ensure exchange rate stability, prevent competitive devaluations, and promote economic growth." [...] It was not until 1958 that the Bretton Woods system became fully operational. Countries now settled their international accounts in dollars that could be converted to gold at a fixed exchange rate of $35 per ounce, which was <b>redeemable</b> <b>by</b> the U.S. government. Thus, the United States was committed to backing every dollar overseas with gold. Other currencies were fixed to the dollar, and the dollar was pegged to gold.|$|R

5000|$|Louis Harap defines {{cultural}} antisemitism as [...] "that {{species of}} anti-Semitism that charges the Jews with corrupting a given culture {{and attempting to}} supplant or succeeding in supplanting the preferred culture with a uniform, crude, [...] "Jewish" [...] culture. Similarly, Eric Kandel characterizes cultural antisemitism as being {{based on the idea}} of [...] "Jewishness" [...] as a [...] "religious or cultural tradition that is acquired through learning, through distinctive traditions and education." [...] According to Kandel, this form of antisemitism views Jews as possessing [...] "unattractive psychological and social characteristics that are acquired through acculturation." [...] Niewyk and Nicosia characterize cultural antisemitism as focusing on and condemning [...] "the Jews' aloofness from the societies in which they live."An important feature of cultural antisemitism is that it considers the negative attributes of Judaism to be <b>redeemable</b> <b>by</b> education or by religious conversion.|$|R

50|$|New {{regulations}} for {{the elections of}} the doge introduced in 1268 remained in force {{until the end of}} the republic in 1797. Their object was to minimize as far as possible the influence of individual great families, and this was effected by a complex electoral machinery. Thirty members of the Great Council, chosen <b>by</b> <b>lot,</b> were reduced <b>by</b> <b>lot</b> to nine; the nine chose forty and the forty were reduced <b>by</b> <b>lot</b> to twelve, who chose twenty-five. The twenty-five were reduced <b>by</b> <b>lot</b> to nine and the nine elected forty-five. Then the forty-five were once more reduced <b>by</b> <b>lot</b> to eleven, and the eleven finally chose the forty-one who actually elected the doge. None could be elected but by at least twenty-five votes out of forty-one, nine votes out of eleven or twelve, or seven votes out of nine electors. A detailed description of this process, and the ceremonial procession that followed, is preserved in Martin Da Canale's work Les Estoires de Venise (English translation by Laura K. Morreale, Padua 2009).|$|R

50|$|Even {{more people}} showed {{interest}} in Coin’s financial school, and more bimetallists joined Coin’s lessons every day. Coin started off the day’s lecture by distinguishing {{between the two}} kinds of credit money: paper money, which include bank notes, and token money, which are forms of metal that do not enjoy free coinage. Credit money was used as promises {{that the government will}} redeem the owner with the primary money, which in this case was gold. Coin pointed out that by abolishing free coinage of silver, the government turned silver from one of the primary money to a token money, no longer <b>redeemable</b> <b>by</b> itself. This, in turn, reduced the nation’s supply of primary money by half. By reducing the nation’s primary money supply, the government effectively rendered many checks and greenback bank notes more volatile, since they were no longer backed by properties, but by speculation and federal government’s credit.|$|R
50|$|After 1172 the {{election}} of the Venetian doge was entrusted to a committee of forty, who were chosen by four men selected from the Great Council of Venice, which was itself nominated annually by twelve persons.
