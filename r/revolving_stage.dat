The network {{had gone to}} great expense to prepare the studio, including an estimated $100,000 to raise the stage and install a separate <b>revolving</b> <b>stage.</b> Garland's dressing room was a 110ft × 40ft trailer which had been decorated as a replica of her newly purchased Brentwood home. The corridor that led from her dressing room to the stage was painted to resemble the Yellow Brick Road from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E
5|$|The Metamorfosis World Tour was a {{worldwide}} concert tour by Guatemalan singer–songwriter Ricardo Arjona {{in support of}} his thirteenth studio album, Independiente. Beginning in January 2012, it was Arjona's first tour since leaving Warner Music to become an independent artist. The tour was announced in December 2011 with dates at American, Argentinian and Chilean venues, and received a positive critical response. The show was designed for a <b>revolving</b> <b>stage,</b> with Arjona performing while the scenery changed with the songs being performed. Four changes of scenery were developed: a two-floor apartment, a bar, a circus and a theatre. The number of songs played at each show varied from 19 to 23.|$|E
25|$|Mawari-butai (<b>revolving</b> <b>stage)</b> {{developed}} in the Kyōhō era (1716–1735). The trick was originally accomplished by the on-stage pushing of a round, wheeled platform. Later a circular platform was embedded in the stage with wheels beneath it facilitating movement. The kuraten (“darkened revolve”) technique involves lowering the stage lights during this transition. More commonly the lights are left on for akaten (“lighted revolve”), sometimes simultaneously performing the transitioning scenes for dramatic effect. This stage was first built in Japan in the early eighteenth century.|$|E

25|$|Benjamin Plotkin {{purchased}} Pinewood Lake and {{the surrounding}} acreage and built forty cabins and an auditorium with a <b>revolving</b> <b>stage</b> and incorporated as the Pine Brook Country Club in 1930. Plotkin's dream was to market the club as a summer resort for people to stay and enjoy theatrical productions. Pine Brook {{is best known for}} becoming the summer rehearsal headquarters of the most important experiment in the history of American theatre. The Group Theatre was formed in New York City by Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford and Lee Strasberg in 1931. The group was made up of actors, directors, playwrights and producers and produced works by the most important American playwrights of the time on real-life subject matter, changing stage and film forever. In 1944, Pine Brook Country Club was sold, reorganized and chartered as the Pinewood Lake Association.|$|E
25|$|Named {{after the}} theatre's first artistic director, Laurence Olivier, {{this is the}} main auditorium, {{modelled}} on the ancient Greek theatre at Epidaurus; it has an open stage and a fan-shaped audience seating area for 1100 people. A 'drum revolve' (a five-storey <b>revolving</b> <b>stage</b> section) extends eight metres beneath the stage and is operated by a single staff member. The drum has two rim revolves and two platforms, each of which can carry ten tonnes, facilitating dramatic and fluid scenery changes. Its design ensures that the audience's view is not blocked from any seat, and that the audience is fully visible to actors from the stage's centre. Designed in the 1970s and a prototype of current technology, the drum revolve and a multiple 'sky hook' flying system were initially very controversial and required ten years to commission, but seem to have fulfilled the objective of functionality with high productivity.|$|E
50|$|The {{system was}} used as a cleaner and more compact {{alternative}} to steam engines, to power workshop machinery, lifts, cranes, theatre machinery (including <b>revolving</b> <b>stages</b> at the London Palladium and the London Coliseum, safety curtains at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, the lifting mechanism for the cinema organ at the Leicester Square theatre and the complete Palm Court orchestra platform), and the backup mechanism of Tower Bridge. It was also used to supply fire hydrants, mostly those inside buildings. The water, pumped straight from the Thames, was heated in winter to prevent freezing.|$|R
50|$|The amphitheater's {{original}} <b>stage</b> was a <b>revolving</b> wooden <b>stage,</b> {{but this}} was washed out during El Niño rains in 1939. The stage was replaced with a concrete slab that remained in place until renovation work in 2001.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first major}} use of <b>revolving</b> <b>stages</b> began in Japan during Kabuki performances. In the 1750s, Namiki Shōzō, {{previously}} just {{known for his}} work as a theatrical dramatist in Japan, introduced a stage design known as a [...] "mawari butai". The literal English translation is [...] "revolving stage"; however, the denotation {{is quite different from the}} modern understanding of the word. Initially, the stages were wheeled circular platforms that were fixed on a stage and turned manually. A wall running through the diameter of the circle allowed a quick reveal of other Kabuki performers and chanters. Although the platform did indeed revolve, the problems of visual scenic changers still hindered the spectacle. Through trial and error methods involving the issues still at hand in the Kabuki theatre, the platform eventually became flush with the immobile sections of the stage. This in turn placed the mechanism below the stage and hid the manual labor. After this downward shift, the manual technology only increased. One circle, in the 1820s in Japan, was placed inside another circle and was used for various transitions. Some special effects included one boat passing another by the two rings turning against each other. This was just an example of many tricks that the Kabuki theatre developed. <b>Revolving</b> <b>stages</b> were a huge step towards the stylized form Kabuki theatre is known for today. They made it possible to depict supernatural transformations and use more creative entrances and exits. Modern Kabuki theatre companies still employ a rotating stage but in a much smaller capacity. For the most part, the wall on the circle is flush with the wall behind the chanters, and a rotation is used to allow new head chanters to be revealed seamlessly.|$|R
25|$|A tour {{to commemorate}} the 25th anniversary of the show began {{performances}} on 12 December 2009, at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff. Differences from the original production included a new set, new costumes, new direction and alterations to the original orchestrations. The tour also did not use a <b>revolving</b> <b>stage</b> and the scenery {{was inspired by the}} paintings of Victor Hugo. Locations have included Manchester, Norwich, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Bristol, Salford, and Southampton. The tour also played a special engagement in Paris. From September through October, the show returned to the Barbican Centre, London, site of the original 1985 production. The tour cast featured John Owen-Jones as Valjean, Earl Carpenter as Javert, Gareth Gates as Marius, Ashley Artus as Thénardier, Lynne Wilmot as Madame Thénardier, Madalena Alberto as Fantine, Rosalind James as Éponine, Jon Robyns as Enjolras, Katie Hall as Cosette (with Eliza Jones as Young Cosette), and David Lawrence as the Bishop of Digne. The tour ended 2 October 2010, at the Barbican.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} {{designed}} for a <b>revolving</b> <b>stage</b> divided into four sets, with Arjona performing with seven musicians and a showgirl. Fifty people were needed {{to set up the}} 45-ton stage, which was transported on 17 trucks. One hundred fifty lights, (seventy of which were mobile) were used during each concert, in addition to ten tons of scenery. Each set related to the songs being performed. The first evoked a two-floor apartment with books, tables and chairs. Here Arjona sang [...] "Lo Que Está Bien Está Mal", [...] "Animal Nocturno", [...] "Hay Amores", [...] "Desnuda" [...] and [...] "El Amor" [...] (during the set change). The second set represented a bar, where the singer performed [...] "Historia de Taxi" [...] and [...] "Como Duele". He then interacted with the audience on [...] "Pingüinos en La Cama"; during some concerts Arjona sang to a fan's phone, and invited an older woman onstage to accompany him on [...] "Señora De Las Cuatro Décadas".|$|E
500|$|Nicholas Hytner {{directed}} a new production of Carousel in 1992, at London's Royal National Theatre, with choreography by Sir Kenneth MacMillan and designs by Bob Crowley. [...] In this staging, {{the story begins}} at the mill, where Julie and Carrie work, with the music slowed down to emphasize the drudgery. [...] After work ends, they move to the shipyards {{and then to the}} carnival. [...] As they proceed on a <b>revolving</b> <b>stage,</b> carnival characters appear, and at last the carousel is assembled onstage for the girls to ride. Louise is seduced by the ruffian boy during her Act 2 ballet, set around the ruins of a carousel. Michael Hayden played Billy not as a large, gruff man, but as a frustrated smaller one, a time bomb waiting to explode. [...] Hayden, Joanna Riding (Julie) and Janie Dee (Carrie) all won Olivier Awards for their performances. Patricia Routledge played Nettie. Enoch and Carrie were cast as an interracial couple whose eight children, according to the review in The New York Times, looked like [...] "a walking United Colors of Benetton ad". Clive Rowe, as Enoch, was nominated for an Olivier Award. The production's limited run from December 1992 through March 1993 was a sellout. It re-opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London in September 1993, presented by Cameron Mackintosh, where it continued until May 1994.|$|E
5000|$|While {{her husbands}} {{may have come}} and gone, one man had {{remained}} a constant influence. Lee Kai Hong, a Chinese-newspaper journalist-property developer, was her long-time friend, and later, her manager. It was with Lee that Chan hatched up an idea to circumvent the colonial British decency laws. In those days, there was a law that allowed for models to pose nude for artists, {{so long as they}} kept absolutely still. As <b>revolving</b> <b>stages</b> were not invented yet, Chan and Lee improvised a little table on coasters, with ropes attached to each corner. The moment she was completed naked, Chan would jump on the table, and four guys would pull each rope, spinning her around so that everyone had a good view. Even though {{the letter of the law}} had been adhered to, the spirit of the law was obviously contravened.|$|R
50|$|Erwin Friedrich Max Piscator {{was born}} on 17 December 1893 in the small Prussian village of Greifenstein-Ulm, son of Carl Piscator, a merchant, and his wife Antonia Laparose. His family was descended from Johannes Piscator, a Protestant theologian who {{produced}} an important translation of the Bible in 1600. The family moved to the university town Marburg in 1899 where Piscator attended the Gymnasium Philippinum. In the autumn of 1913, he attended a private Munich drama school and enrolled at University of Munich to study German, philosophy and art history. Piscator also took Arthur Kutscher's famous seminar in theatre history which Bertolt Brecht was also later to attend. He began his acting career {{in the autumn of}} 1914, in small unpaid roles at the Munich Court Theatre, under the directorship of Ernst von Possart. In 1896, Karl Lautenschläger had installed one of the world's first <b>revolving</b> <b>stages</b> at that theatre.|$|R

500|$|Jumpers was {{scheduled}} to appear at the National Theatre {{at the start of}} 1972, but encountered problems when the theatre's director, Laurence Olivier, called the play [...] "unintelligible" [...] before walking out during the first read-through in disgust. Despite this, rehearsals went ahead, which the cast found difficult; the play featured many scenes, a complicated script, and relied heavily on the opening scene, a sceptical speech about the existence of God which lasted 13 minutes. In his autobiography, Hordern commented: [...] "Each day my fists would sink into my cardigan pockets as I tried {{to make sense of it}} all." [...] In a meeting shortly before the opening night, Olivier complained to Stoppard that the play was overlong and, in some parts, laborious. Stoppard agreed to reduce the epilogue by half. The decision angered Hordern as it meant the extra stress of learning a new script at short notice. [...] He vented his frustrations on Wood who agreed to leave his character alone and instead to cut many of the other scenes. The final dress rehearsal also experienced disruption when the <b>revolving</b> <b>stage</b> broke down and had to be fixed half-way through. The problems had ceased by the opening performance the following evening; it was a night which Hordern called [...] "unbelievable, one of the highlights of my career". [...] The actress Maureen Lipman, who was in the audience on the opening night, said that her husband, the playwright Jack Rosenthal, had [...] "laughed so hard he thought he was going to be seriously ill".|$|E
2500|$|Set {{designer}} Miriam Buether transformed Hampstead Theatre {{into its}} very own stadium, giving the audience an immersive experience that evoked the 1924 Paris Olympics, including seating {{in the round}} around an Olympic track, and a [...] double <b>revolving</b> <b>stage.</b> Buether also later transformed the Gielgud Theatre into an immersive stadium with a track running through the audience. And choreographer Scott Ambler reinvented and choreographed the various running scenes for maximum theatrical effect.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the design}} phase the {{proscenium}} was eliminated, thereby blending {{the stage and}} the auditorium into one unit. This created a more intimate relationship between the actors and the audience. The stage is {{able to be a}} <b>revolving</b> <b>stage</b> for some performances. Above the stage is the huge cantilevered , [...] concrete drum. Weighing 127 tons, Wright designed the drum to be counterbalanced by the corresponding weight and structure of the three-flight dressing room area behind the stage.|$|E
60|$|The {{father always}} described, before the curtain was withdrawn, {{with a sort}} of savage terseness, the subject of the {{impending}} scene.

This rapidity of representation was necessary, lest delay should compromise the indispensable immovable-ness of the performers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{potential}} [...] "genius" [...] delivers {{their idea}} from a podium while Gorman and his guest {{talk about the}} merits of the plan, performing some experiments concerning the idea.

If the player is declared a genius, the judge pushes the white button and the <b>stage</b> <b>revolves</b> clockwise, where the player enters a white door and is declared [...] "Genius". If the player is not a genius, the judge pressed the red button and the <b>stage</b> <b>revolves</b> anticlockwise, where the player enters a red door and is declared [...] "Not a genius". When all of the ideas have been heard, the judge is then given 10 seconds to decide which of the genius ideas is the most genius. The creator of the winning idea is awarded with the Genius Trophy.|$|R
25|$|Several {{changes were}} made for the game's North American release, which are {{not found in the}} Japanese and PAL {{versions}} of the game. The most notable change <b>revolves</b> around <b>Stage</b> 6, where Lammy no longer dies and goes to Hell, but instead snags her belt on a door handle and winds up flung onto a volcanic island. This results in some different graphics for Lammy during this stage, as well as the following cutscene, as well as a slight change in lyrics in Stage 1 for continuity. Lyrics were also changed in various stages, such as Stage 5, which features a lumberjack. Lines were changed in this stage to avoid themes of deforestation.|$|R
2500|$|Investors {{bought the}} Moulin Rouge Gardens {{property}} and spent one-million dollars {{to expand the}} facility.

Larry Fine was performing there the night he was asked to join The Three Stooges. The Rainbo Room had a <b>revolving</b> <b>stage</b> to allow for continuous entertainment. There was table seating for 2,000 patrons and space on the dance floor for an additional 1,500. Until 1927, WMAQ radio shared the 670 kilohertz frequency with station WQJ, which was owned by the Rainbo and Calumet Baking Powder Company; it broadcast music of the Rainbo's performers as a form of promotion.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, Yes's line-up {{expanded}} to incorporate three former members (Wakeman, Howe and Bruford) joining {{forces with the}} band's five-man line-up, and oddly {{it was the first}} time Kaye and Wakeman had ever met, but both professed they took an instant liking to each other and got on well.

In 1994, Yes released Talk, Kaye's final album with them. Kaye only played the Hammond organ on Talk - all of the other keyboards being played by Trevor Rabin. On tour, Kaye used a couple of master keyboards, which played the sounds from large racks of synthesizer and sampler modules hidden beneath the stage. After Talk, Kaye offered to stay with the band in a management capacity, but this did not occur and his involvement with the band ceased.|$|E
2500|$|The kabuki stage {{features}} a projection called a hanamichi ( [...] , [...] "flower path"), a walkway which extends {{into the audience}} and via which dramatic entrances and exits are made. Okuni also performed on a hanamichi stage with her entourage. The stage is used {{not only as a}} walkway or path to get to and from the main stage, but important scenes are also played on the stage. Kabuki stages and theaters have steadily become more technologically sophisticated, and innovations including revolving stages and trap doors were introduced during the 18th century. A driving force has been the desire to manifest one frequent theme of kabuki theater, that of the sudden, dramatic revelation or transformation. A number of stage tricks, including actors' rapid appearance and disappearance, employ these innovations. The term keren (...) , often translated playing to the gallery, is sometimes used as a catch-all for these tricks. Hanamichi and several innovations including <b>revolving</b> <b>stage,</b> seri and chunori have all contributed to kabuki play. Hanamichi creates depth and both seri and chunori provide a vertical dimension.|$|E
50|$|Traditional festivals in Mizoram often <b>revolved</b> around <b>stages</b> of jhum {{cultivation}} or the seasons. Community festivals {{were called}} kut {{in the local}} language, and there were major and minor kuts such as Chapchar Kut, Thalfavang Kut, Mim Kut and Pawl Kut. Chapchar Kut was the festival of spring (February/March), just before jhum started and land was cut-and-burnt for a new crop. Chapchar Kut was most anticipated by youth, a major festival and involved dancing and feasts. Thalfavang Kut celebrated completion of weeding of the jhum crop fields. Mim Kut was the festival dedicated to ancestors after first maize crop was collected, while Pawl Kut celebrated the end of harvest {{and the start of}} new year. These festivals slowly disappeared as Christianity became established in Mizoram.|$|R
40|$|Developments in {{technology}} and new aesthetic idioms in the past decades have changed the preconditions for the scenographer’s work in the theatre. Therefore, it has become problematic indeed to describe scenography as the sum of costume and set, although this {{continues to be the}} common definition of the concept. This study focuses on the interaction of different features in a theatre performance, such as scenography, actors, light and sound. The aim is to show that scenography, as opposed to set and costume, cannot be separated from the live performance, i. e. the context for which it is created. By investigating scenography from the parameters space, time, and movement, the thesis demonstrates that the art is anything but stable. On the contrary, it continuously changes shape, size, and appearance. The actors in particular {{play an important role in}} the organization of the space, thus exposing the instability of scenography in action. The analytical chapters in the thesis discuss four different movements, or transformations, in scenography, appearing in eight theatre productions staged by Swedish director Ingmar Bergman between 1984 and 1998. The first chapter, "Expansion," discusses how scenography incorporates new spaces, either through the actors’ movements or by quoting architectonic details from other parts of the theatre building. "Revolution" shows different ways of revolving scenography without the aid of technical devises such as the <b>revolve</b> <b>stage.</b> "Perforation," the third chapter, analyses the effects of a perforated set and its consequences for the spectators’ apprehension of scenography. The last chapter, "Metamorphoses," highlights actions that undermine the definition of some central concepts in performance, such as “performers,” “props,” and “spectators,” all of which are intertwined in the analysed productions. A concluding part of the dissertation elaborates on the effects of these movements and transformations in scenography, in particular as related to the physical and mental relationship between actor and audience...|$|R

2500|$|Tormato was {{released}} in September 1978 {{at the height of}} punk rock in England, during which the music press criticised Yes as representing the bloated excesses of early-1970s progressive rock. The album saw the band continuing their movement towards shorter songs; no track runs longer than eight minutes. Wakeman replaced his Mellotrons with the Birotron, a tape replay keyboard, and Squire experimented with harmonisers and Mu-tron pedals with his bass. Production was handled collectively by the band and saw disagreements at the mixing stage among the members. With heavy commercial rock-radio airplay, the album reached number 8 in the UK and number 10 in the US charts, and was also certified platinum (1 million copies sold) by the RIAA. Despite internal and external criticisms of the album, the band's 1978–1979 tour was a commercial success. Concerts were performed in the round with a £50,000-central <b>revolving</b> <b>stage</b> and a 360-degree sound system fitted above it. Yes earned a [...] "Golden Ticket Award" [...] for grossing over $1 million in box office receipts.|$|E
2500|$|In 1846 Nicholson began showing poses plastiques, {{a form of}} tableau vivant, at Garrick's Head and Town Hotel. The acts, {{which later}} became a common form of {{entertainment}} in London, featured models reenacting a work of art. Nicholson {{claimed to have been}} the first person in London to host such an event. The performances were typically scheduled for the early evening, and after performances in the local theatres concluded. At Nicholson's hotel, the models often stood on a <b>revolving</b> <b>stage</b> that overlooked the audience. The stage was illuminated by blue lights, and the room was covered in mirrors. Nicholson stood near the models as they posed and delivered a lecture on art to the audience, most of whom drank and smoked cigars during the performance. He advertised the events as [...] "representing Pictures from the Manchester Art Galleries and scenes from all the Principal Tragedies, Dramas, Operas". The women were purported to be a musical group known as the [...] "Female American Serenaders". Many of the titles of the acts suggested that nudity would be on display, such as [...] "The Sultan's Favourite returning from the bath" [...] or [...] "Cupid and Psyche".
