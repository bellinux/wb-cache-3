5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an induction motor that ran on alternating current, a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States {{because of its}} advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E
40|$|Ferrofluids are {{conventionally}} used in such DC <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> applications as rotary {{and exclusion}} seals, stepper motor dampers, and heat transfer fluids. Recent research demonstrates ferrofluid use in alternating and <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> for MEMS/NEMS application of microfluidic devices and bio-applications such as targeted drug delivery, enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and hypothermia. This thesis studies ferrofluid ferrohydrodynamics in uniform and non-uniform <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> through modeling and measurements of ferrofluid torque and spin-up flow profiles. To characterize the water-based and oil-based ferrofluids {{used in the}} experiments, measurements were made of the mass density, surface tension, viscosity, magnetization curve, nanoparticle size, and the speed of sound. Initial analysis for planar Couette and Poiseuille flows exploit DC <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> effects on flow and spin velocities with zero spin viscosity. Above critical values of <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> strength and flow velocity, multiple values of <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> spin velocity, and effective magnetoviscosity result, indicating that zero spin viscosity may be non-physical. Torque and spin-up flow profile measurements show the effect of volume torque density and body force density in uniform and non-uniform <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> (cont.) Ferrofluid "negative viscosity" measurements in uniform and non-uniform <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> occur when <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> induced flow creates torque that exceeds the torque necessary to drive a viscometer spindle. Numerical simulations of torque and spin-up flow in uniform and non-uniform <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields,</b> including contribution from the spin velocity and spin viscosity terms, are fitted to measurements to estimate the value ranges of relaxation time r - 1. 3 - 30 gs and spin viscosity n' - 1 - 11. 8 x 109 Nos in waterbased ferrofluid. Based on the ferrohydrodynamic theory and models, theory of the complex magnetic susceptibility tensor is derived, which depends on spin velocity, {{that can be a}} key to external <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> control of ferrofluid biomedical applications. Preliminary impedance analysis and measurements investigate complex magnetic susceptibility change of ferrofluid in oscillating and <b>rotating</b> uniform <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> and allow calculation of the resulting dissipated power or mechanical work in pumping fluid. by Xiaowei He.

25|$|Strong magnets {{are used}} to {{separate}} out ferrous metals, such as iron, steel, and tin cans.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to provide data from ferrofluid flow and torque measurements in uniform and nonuniform <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> that can be compared to theoretical analyses in order to fully understand observed paradoxical ferrofluid behavior. In the presence of <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields,</b> ferrofluid particles will rotate to try to align their magnetic moment with the field but because of the fluid viscosity, magnetization M will lag behind the rotating H field, thereby resulting in a body torque on the ferrofluid. The viscous torque from this fluid flow is measured using a Couette viscometer as a function of <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> amplitude, frequency, and direction of rotation. The first three sets of experiments measure this torque on the outer wall of a Lexan spindle that is attached to a viscometer, functioning as a torque meter. The spindle is immersed in a beaker of ferrofluid centered inside a 2 -pole or 4 -pole motor stator winding, creating uniform or nonuniform <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields,</b> respectively. The spindle rotates at a constant speed up to 100 rpm or is stationary in these measurements. Anomalous behaviors such as zero and negative magnetoviscosity are demonstrated and discussed. The next set of experiments measure the magnetic torque on the inner wall of a hollow spindle attached to the torque meter and filled completely with ferrofluid so that there is no free surface. The spindle is centered inside the motor stator windings and exposed to clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> The last set of experiments measures the surface spin rate of a small floating plastic ball placed on the ferrofluid surface at a fixed location as a function of <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> parameters and radial position on the surface. When the <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> induce ferrofluid flows, the ball spins in the opposite direction to <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> rotation and this spin rate is determined using frame-by-frame video analysis. by Adam D.

25|$|For {{a planet}} around a {{red dwarf star}} to support life, it would require a rapidly <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> {{to protect it from}} the flares. A tidally locked planet rotates only very slowly, and so cannot produce a geodynamo at its core. The violent flaring period of a red dwarf's life cycle is {{estimated}} to only last roughly the first 1.2 billion years of its existence. If a planet forms far away from a red dwarf so as to avoid tidal locking, and then migrates into the star's habitable zone after this turbulent initial period, it is possible that life may have a chance to develop. However, given its age, at 7–12 billion years of age, Barnard's Star is considerably older than the Sun. It was long assumed to be quiescent in terms of stellar activity. Yet, in 1998, astronomers observed an intense stellar flare, surprisingly showing that Barnard's Star is, despite its age, a flare star.|$|E
500|$|The vast {{majority}} of the Solar System consists of a near-vacuum known as the interplanetary medium. Along with light, the Sun radiates a continuous stream of charged particles (a plasma) known as the solar wind. This stream of particles spreads outwards at roughly 1.5 million kilometres per hour, creating a tenuous atmosphere that permeates the interplanetary medium out to at least 100AU (see [...] ). Activity on the Sun's surface, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, disturb the heliosphere, creating space weather and causing geomagnetic storms. The largest structure within the heliosphere is the heliospheric current sheet, a spiral form created by the actions of the Sun's <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> on the interplanetary medium.|$|E

500|$|The first pulsar was {{discovered}} in 1967 by Jocelyn Bell and her PhD supervisor Antony Hewish using the Interplanetary Scintillation Array. Shortly after the discovery of pulsars, Franco Pacini and Thomas Gold independently suggested that pulsars are highly magnetized rotating neutron stars, which form {{as a result of}} a supernova at the end of the life stars more massive than about 10 times the mass of the Sun. The radiation emitted by pulsars is caused by interaction of the plasma surrounding the neutron star with its rapidly <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> This interaction leads to emission [...] "in the pattern of a rotating beacon," [...] as emission escapes along the magnetic poles of the neutron star. The [...] "rotating beacon" [...] property of pulsars arises from the misalignment of their magnetic poles with their rotational poles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first person}} to {{conceive}} of a <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> was Walter Baily who gave a workable demonstration of his battery-operated polyphase motor aided by a commutator on June 28, 1879 to the Physical Society of London. Nearly identical to Baily’s apparatus, French electrical engineer Marcel Deprez in 1880 published a paper that identified the <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> principle and that of a two-phase AC system of currents to produce it. [...] In 1886, English engineer Elihu Thomson built an AC motor by expanding upon the induction-repulsion principle and his wattmeter.|$|E
2500|$|The Italian {{inventor}} Galileo Ferraris {{invented a}} polyphase AC induction motor in 1885. The {{idea was that}} two out-of-phase, but synchronized, currents {{might be used to}} produce two magnetic fields that could be combined to produce a rotating field without any need for switching or for moving parts. Other inventors were the American engineers Charles S. Bradley and Nikola Tesla, and the German technician Friedrich August Haselwander. They were able to overcome the problem of starting up the AC motor by using a <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> produced by a poly-phase current. Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky introduced the first three-phase induction motor in 1890, a much more capable design that became the prototype used in Europe and the U.S. By 1895 GE and Westinghouse both had AC motors on the market. With single phase current either a capacitor or coil (creating inductance) can be used on part of the circuit inside the motor to create a <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> [...] Multi-speed AC motors that have separately wired poles have long been available, the most common being two speed. Speed of these motors is changed by switching sets of poles on or off, which was done with a special motor starter for larger motors, or a simple multiple speed switch for fractional horsepower motors.|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this project was to achieve a {{diffusive}} mass and heat transport {{by the use of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> and to eliminate time-dependent thermocapillary convection during crystal growth from free melt zones. The influence of static and <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> on convective temperature fluctuations in a gallium melt was investigated, further the effect of strong static fields on the mass transport in Vertical Bridgman process was analyzed for Germanium and grmanium-silicon, and finally the interaction of static and rotating fields was studied during the Floating-Zone growth of silicon. Weak <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> are already sufficient to eliminate convective temperature fluctuation but to change the mass transport towards a diffusive regime, strong fields of several tesla are required and even then it could not be fulfilled for all growth systems. In the case of static <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields,</b> thermoelectromagnetic convection (TEMC) was observed frequently and caused undesirable compositional inhomogeneities. In contrast to this, <b>rotating</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> show a very positive effect on the segregation and the interface shape.
