40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{computational}} aspects {{related to the}} construction <b>of</b> <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> polynomial chaos expansion in high dimension. The method proposed consists of (1) constructing the <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> the multivariate monomials using a generator <b>of</b> independent <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> the germs whose probability distribution is the given arbitrary measure and (2) performing an orthogonalization <b>of</b> the <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> the multivariate monomials with an algorithm different from the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization algorithm which is not stable in high dimension. A brief review of polynomial chaos expansion with arbitrary measure is given. The statistically independent <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> multivariate monomials are introduced. The centered statistically independent <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> orthonormal multivariate polynomials are developed. Finally, a quantification of the errors induced by the usual methods is given...|$|R

To guarantee Nambu-Goldstone <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> the symmetries, the Goldstino decay constant {{is forced to}} vary as the explicit soft scale and chiral symmetry breaking parameters. Consequently, it must vanish in the chiral limit and the simultaneous nonlinear <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> the super and scale symmetries proves inconsistent...|$|R

5|$|In QFT, {{the demand}} for {{relativistic}} invariance enters, among other ways in that the S-matrix necessarily must be Poincaré invariant. This has the implication {{that there is one}} or more infinite-dimensional representation of the Lorentz group acting on Fock space. One way to guarantee the existence of such representations is the existence of a Lagrangian description (with modest requirements imposed, see the reference) of the system using the canonical formalism, from which a <b>realization</b> <b>of</b> the generators of the Lorentz group may be deduced.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} free field <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> affine current superalgebras are considered. Based on {{quantizing}} differential operator <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding basic Lie superalgebras, general and simple expressions {{for both the}} bosonic and the fermionic currents are provided. Screening currents of the first kind are also presented. Finally, explicit free field <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> primary fields with general, possibly non-integer, weights are worked out. A formalism is used where the (generally infinite) multiplet {{is replaced by a}} generating function primary operator. The results allow setting up integral representations for correlators of primary fields corresponding to integrable representations. The results are generalizations to superalgebras of a recent work on free field <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> affine current algebras by Petersen, Yu and the present author.
