2500|$|Continental Airlines is {{planning}} flight tests using aircraft powered by biofuel rather than traditional Jet-A1. On January 7, 2009, Continental partnered with GE Aviation {{to conduct a}} biofuel demonstration flight, making the airline the first U.S. carrier to conduct tests using biofuels. The test bed, a Boeing 737–800 (registered as N76516), ran one of its engines on a mix of 50% kerosene, 6% algae, and 44% jatropha, a weed that bears oil producing seeds. The engine running partly on biofuel burned 46kg less fuel than the conventional engine in 1 {{and a half hours}} while producing more thrust using the same volume of fuel. Continental's CEO, Larry Kellner, commented [...] "This is a good step forward, an opportunity to <b>really</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> to the environment" [...] citing jatropha's 50–60% lower CO2 emissions as opposed to Jet-A1 in its lifecycle.|$|E

The classroom environment has both cognitive and affective elements.

Prevalent factors in teaching methodologies and student experiences include cooperative learning, technology, brain-based instruction, and curriculum structure.

30|$|What {{this shows}} {{is that the}} {{increase}} in labor income that we noted earlier in the rural sector came mainly from a very large increase in wages. The actual employment in the primary sector fell, though that is offset by rising employment in both manufacturing and the tertiary sector. But what <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> is the growth in average rural wages. 11 Overall rural employment hardly moves, but there is a shift from primary to secondary and tertiary employment. What seems to have happened was the creation of a dynamic urban economy particularly in the Sierra-Selva region where the 89 % of the rural poor lived. 12 That raised income and employment in the urban areas and drew the working age population out of the rural areas of the sierra. That in turn permitted wages to rise in the rural area, particularly for workers in the manufacturing and services sub sectors.|$|R

According to {{the current}} {{definition}} of Specific Language Impairment (SLI), the transition to word combinations can be a troublesome period for children with this impairment. The {{purpose of this study}} is to reveal if an emphasis on verbs during intervention <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in children's progress in language intervention. By examining two types of intervention - one a traditional lexicon therapy without an explicit focus on verbs, the other an intervention that included an explicit focus on facilitating the verb lexicon - this study highlights how intervention with verbs may foster a child's ability to produce word combinations. Two children at risk for SLI were followed longitudinally in this study. Measures included the number of verbs in expressive vocabulary per parent report, the number of verbs produced in two 20 minute language samples, unique syntactic types, and the number of productive semantic relations. In this case, it appears that a verb-focused approach was more successful in facilitating the transition to early sentences. The implications of verb-focused intervention services are discussed. B.

According to Schein, “culture and leadership are {{two sides of the}} same coin and one cannot understand one without the other”, page three in (Schein 2009).

At Google, the founders thought they could create a company that people would want to work at when creating a home-like environment.

5000|$|Biofuels are fuels {{derived from}} biomass {{material}} such as plants and waste. Plant derived biofuels offer large savings in CO2 emissions as they absorb Carbon Dioxide and release it as Oxygen {{when they grow}} and so in a life-cycle, emissions can be drastically reduced.

Now, President Bush does this because he knows first-hand that power of faith to change lives—from the inside out. And the reason he knows this isbecause faith changed his life...
