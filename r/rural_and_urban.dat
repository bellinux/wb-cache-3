5|$|Officially {{designated}} as Yeovil Municipal Borough in 1854, the town continued to lend {{its name to}} the area with the creation of the local government district of Yeovil on 1 April 1974, with the merging several neighbouring <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> districts, which is today known as South Somerset. Some of the suburbs fall within the civil parishes of Yeovil Without and Brympton.|$|E
5|$|For the season, three {{characters}} are downgraded from series regular to recurring status, {{and a new}} character is introduced. Filming took place in Dallas, Texas due to a close proximity of <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> settings. For the final three episodes, scenes were filmed in Pensacola, Florida to represent Panama. Critical reviews of the season were generally positive, {{with the addition of}} William Fichtner to the cast receiving much praise.

5|$|Marrakesh {{has long}} been an {{important}} centre for healthcare in Morocco, and the regional <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> populations alike are reliant upon hospitals in the city. The psychiatric hospital installed by the Merinid Caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur in the 16th century was described by the historian 'Abd al-Wahfd al- Marrakushi {{as one of the greatest}} in the world at the time. A strong Andalusian influence was evident in the hospital, and many of the physicians to the Caliphs came from places such as Seville, Zaragoza and Denia in eastern Spain.|$|E
5|$|Pigs are {{not one of}} {{the main}} forms of {{livestock}} on Welsh farms though there are some specialised units. They used to be kept in small numbers on farms and by <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> cottagers. In the twentieth century, many miners in the South Wales valleys still kept a pig in a backyard sty, to be killed for production of fresh and salt pork, bacon, faggots and black pudding. In 2011 there were 25,600 pigs in Wales, less than half the number that were present a decade earlier.|$|E
5|$|Scouts South Africa is {{actively}} involved in community work, particularly {{in the rural areas}} of South Africa. In some rural areas, such as the greater Tzaneen area, there are Troops with over 100 Scouts. Rural Troops are often limited in their activities by funding and lack of equipment. Their programme focuses on educating the Scouts in becoming good citizens and in the dangers of HIV. Educating Scouts in HIV and AIDS is vitally important due to the large number of infections in both <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> areas of South Africa.|$|E

Suddenly, the Alien Queen is seen appearing out of the hospital's rubble, only to be destroyed, along with the entire town, by a nuclear warhead, while the Predator successfully leaves Earth.|$|E
5|$|Later in 2005, the Council of Social Sciences, Pakistan, in {{collaboration}} with the National Rural Support Programme and other institutions, announced the Akhter Hameed Khan Memorial Award. The annual cash award is given on Khan's birthday to a Pakistani author for a book on issues related to <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> development, peace, poverty alleviation, or gender discrimination. At the occasion of the award ceremony in 2006, a documentary film about {{the life and times of}} Akhter Hameed Khan was premiered.

5|$|Renewed for {{a second}} season, Prison Break resumed filming on June 15, 2006, in Dallas, Texas due to the close {{proximity}} of <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> settings. Locations within a 30-minute radius of Dallas were chosen which included Little Elm, Decatur, Mineral Wells and McKinney. Many of these locations were used to represent various American towns. The show was expected to spend in excess of $50 million in Texas {{over the course of}} the second season. For the final three episodes of the second season, filming took place in Pensacola, Florida to represent Panama. Each episode took eight days to film and approximately $1.4 million went to the local economy per episode.|$|E

30|$|A {{comparison}} of <b>rural</b> migrants <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> residents shows {{that nearly all}} of the income gap can be explained by differences in individual characteristics, suggesting that discrimination is almost negligible. A comparison between <b>rural</b> migrants <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> migrants, isolating the migration effect but not the rural/urban hukou status effect, shows that 40 % of the income gap is unexplained by observed characteristics. By comparing instead urban migrants with urban residents, this time isolating the hukou effect (agricultural/non-agricultural), we find evidence of discrimination in income. Since urban migrants earn the most of all groups, we therefore presume that the absence of discrimination from the comparison between <b>rural</b> migrants <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> residents is a net effect of discrimination against <b>rural</b> hukou status <b>and</b> a premium accrued generally by migrating.|$|R

5|$|<b>Rural</b> <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> cantons had {{the same}} {{standing}} in the federation. Each canton was sovereign within its territory, pursuing its own foreign policy and also minting its own money. The diet and central council of the federation, the Tagsatzung, held no real power and served more {{as an instrument of}} coordination. The reformation in the early 16th century had led to a confessional division amongst the cantons: the central Swiss cantons including Lucerne had remained Catholic, while Zürich, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and also the city of St. Gallen had become Protestant. The Tagsatzung was often paralysed by disagreements between the equally strong factions of the Catholic and Protestant sides.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographic}} and geomorphic characteristics of Argentina tend to create extreme weather conditions, often leading to natural disasters that negatively impact the country both economically and socially. The Pampas, {{where many of}} the large cities are located, has a flat topography and poor water drainage, making it vulnerable to flooding. Severe storms can lead to tornados, damaging hail, storm surges, and high winds, causing extensive damage to houses and infrastructure, displacing thousands of people and causing significant loss of life. Extreme temperature events such as heat waves and cold waves impact <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> areas by negatively impacting agriculture, one of the main economic activities of the country, and by increasing energy demand, which can lead to energy shortages.|$|E
5|$|The interwar {{years were}} marked by {{economic}} stagnation in <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> areas, and high unemployment. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|A study {{published}} by Mulungushi University indicated that age distortions {{were found in}} census data and a tendency of age heaping with terminal digits of ‘0’ and ‘5’ were common. It also reported that gender differences existed in age reporting in Zambia with more number of males reporting their ages wrongly. But the report acknowledged the difficulties in data collection and stated {{that the quality of}} data collection was better than the previous census enumerations. Another {{study published}} in the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health journal indicated that the census reported very high adult female mortality, particularly a high pregnancy-related mortality in both <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> areas twelve months prior to the census. The evaluation of population age, age-at-death, live births were reported to contain data errors. Another study by Demographic Research indicated that the data of people aged above 80 was not accurately captured in most sub-Saharan countries, which prevented research on age-related health ailments and other socio-economic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Dorset hosts {{a number}} of annual festivals, fairs and events {{including}} the Great Dorset Steam Fair near Blandford, {{one of the largest}} events of its kind in Europe, and the Bournemouth Air Festival, a free air show that attracted 1.3million visitors in 2009. The Spirit of the Seas is a maritime festival held in Weymouth and Portland. Launched in 2008, the festival features sporting activities, cultural events and local entertainers. The Dorset County Show, which was first held in 1841, is a celebration of Dorset's agriculture. The two-day event exhibits local produce and livestock and attracts some 55,000 people. Inside Out Dorset is an outdoor arts festival produced by Dorchester-based Activate Performing Arts that takes place every two years in <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> locations across Dorset. In addition to the smaller folk festivals held in towns such as Christchurch and Wimborne, Dorset holds several larger musical events such as Camp Bestival, Endorse It in Dorset, End of the Road and the Larmer Tree Festival.|$|E

5|$|Guinea pigs (called cuy, cuye, or curí) were {{originally}} domesticated for their {{meat in the}} Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s, {{it has become more}} socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be {{a major part of the}} diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment. Both <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, primary {{education}} reform {{had become one}} of the top priorities in the People's Republic of China. About 160million Chinese people had missed all or part of their education because of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and in 1986 the National People's Congress enacted a law calling for nine years of compulsory education. By 1993, it was clear that much of the country was making little progress on implementing nine-year compulsory education, so the 1993–2000seven-year plan focused on this goal. One of the major challenges educators faced was the large number of rural schoolchildren dropping out to pursue work. Another issue was a large urban–rural divide: funding and teacher quality were far better in urban schools than <b>rural,</b> <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> students stayed in school longer.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{became a}} Member State of the United Nations on 20 September 1960, shortly after gaining its {{independence}} on 26 June 1960. As of January 2017, 34 police officers from Madagascar are deployed in Haiti {{as part of}} the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti. Starting in 2015, under the direction of and with assistance from the UN, the World Food Programme started the Madagascar Country Programme with the two main goals of long-term development/ reconstruction efforts and addressing the food insecurity issues in the southern regions of Madagascar. These goals plan to be accomplished by providing meals for specific schools in <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> priority areas and by developing national school feeding policies to increase consistency of nourishment throughout the country.
