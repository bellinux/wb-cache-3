The film has been released internationally throughout early to late 2008. The film was released in South Korea (January 24, 2008), Malaysia (July 1, 2008), Singapore (March 13, 2008), Hong Kong (April 3, 2008), Taiwan (April 18, 2008), Germany (October 2008), and Italy by Dynit (October 30, 2008). The film was released on DVD in Australia by <b>Red</b> <b>Ant</b> Enterprises on November 12, 2008, although that release is no longer available for sale as <b>Red</b> <b>Ant</b> Enterprises went into receivership in January 2009. The Australian rights have since been sub-licensed to Madman Entertainment, who have a special relationship with FUNimation and have {{the rights to the}} TV series and movies from Manga Entertainment and ADV Films. The film was released in France by distributor Dybex at the out of competition screening at the 2008 Annecy International Animated Film Festival. The film made its Canadian premiere at the Waterloo Festival for Animated Cinema in November 2008.|$|E
25|$|Pogonomyrmex {{barbatus}} is {{a species}} of harvester ant from the genus Pogonomyrmex. Its common names include <b>red</b> <b>ant</b> and red harvester ant. These large (5– to 7-mm) ants prefer arid chaparral habitats and are native to the Southwestern United States. Nests are made underground (up to 2.5 m deep) in exposed areas. Their diets consist primarily of seeds, and they consequently participate in myrmecochory, an ant-plant interaction through which the ants gain nutrients and the plants benefit through seed dispersal. Red harvester ants are often mistaken for fire ants, but are not closely related to any fire ant species, native or introduced.|$|E

500|$|Stanton {{took one}} of the early circus bug {{character}}s, Red the <b>red</b> <b>ant,</b> and changed him into the character Flik. The Circus Bugs, no longer out to cheat the colony, would be embroiled in a comic misunderstanding as to why Flik was recruiting them. Lasseter agreed with this new approach, and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw spent a few months working on further polishing with Stanton. The characters [...] "Tuck and Roll" [...] were inspired by a drawing that Stanton did of two bugs fighting {{when he was in the}} second grade. Lasseter had come to envision the film as an epic in the tradition of David Lean's 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to analyse the {{inorganic}} and organic contents in the leaf of Datura metel and to investigate the acute toxicity at varying concentrations on grasshoppers and <b>red</b> <b>ants.</b> We determined the calcium, magnesium and phosphorous in the ionic state quantitatively and carried out screening tests and solvent extraction using chloroform {{to find out the}} presence of organic groups such as alkaloids, flavanoids, saponins and steroids. The concentration of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Fe 3 + and PO 43 - were found to be (4. 28 +/- 0. 05) x 10 (4), (3. 86 +/- 0. 009) x 10 (4), (2. 33 +/- 0. 007) x 10 (4) and (4. 65 +/- 0. 06) x 10 (4) ppm respectively. The screening tests confirmed the presence of alkaloids and steroids and the absence of saponins and flavanoids. Increasing concentrations of the plant extracts (2500 - 15000 ppm) were added to grasshoppers (n = 10) and <b>red</b> <b>ants</b> (n = 10) in an experimental chamber. After 10 minutes of exposure, the numbers of live insects were counted. The results showed the EC 50 value was 12000 ppm for grasshoppers and 11600 ppm for <b>red</b> <b>ants.</b> Percentage mortality increased from 20 - 60 % with increasing concentrations. Our results indicated that extract of Datura metel leaves at higher concentrations was more toxic and it can be used as an insecticide against grasshoppers and <b>red</b> <b>ants...</b>|$|R

[...] The head contains eyes that detect acute movement, three small ocelli to detect light and polarization, and two mandibles. [...] Attached to the head are two antennae. All six legs are attached to the mesosoma. [...] The metasoma houses vital internal organs. “The pedicel of the metasoma is two-segmented,” which is unique for the Subfamily Myrmicinae. [...] The head and abdomen are dark, thereby giving the ant a two-toned appearance. [...] Individual ants are small, with workers measuring around [...] in length and queens being only 10% larger. [...] Colonies are small compared to those of other ants—they have anywhere from a few dozen to a few hundred workers and one to several queens.|$|E

60|$|The {{crowning}} {{glory of}} owning slaves, which many philosophic Americans (before the war) showed {{to be the}} highest and noblest function of the most advanced humanity, has been attained {{by more than one}} variety of anthood. Our great English horse-ant is a moderate slaveholder; but the big <b>red</b> <b>ant</b> of Southern Europe carries the domestic institution many steps further. It makes regular slave-raids upon the nests of the small brown ants, and carries off the young in their pupa condition. By-and-by the brown ants hatch out in the strange nest, and never having known any other life except that of slavery, accommodate themselves to it readily enough. The <b>red</b> <b>ant,</b> however, is still only an occasional slaveowner; if necessary, he can get along by himself, without the aid of his little brown servants. Indeed, there are free states and slave states of red ants side by side with one another, as of old in Maryland and Pennsylvania: in the first, the red ants do their work themselves, like mere vulgar Ohio farmers; in the second, they get their work done for them by their industrious little brown servants, like the aristocratic first families of Virginia before the earthquake of emancipation.|$|E

40|$|The Schaus swallowtail, Papilio aristodemus ponceanus, {{historically}} {{occurred in}} tropical hardwood hammocks from South Miami {{to the upper}} Florida Keys and is currently listed as federally endangered. Much of the remaining hardwood hammock habitat is fragmented by roads and human development that may alter the microhabitat within the hammocks and increase the probability of invasion by non-native predators and competitors. One non-indigenous species that has recently invaded the Florida Keys, and that may impact the Schaus swallowtail is the <b>red</b> imported fire <b>ant</b> (Solenopsis invicta Buren). We estimated abundance of <b>red</b> imported fire <b>ants</b> in Schaus swallowtail habitat on Key Largo, and the decrease in <b>red</b> imported fire <b>ants</b> resulting from the application of chemical ant baits. In addition, we conducted laboratory experiments to determine how vulnerable swallowtail life stages are to <b>red</b> imported fire <b>ant</b> predation. We found <b>red</b> imported fire <b>ants</b> at 50 % of transects in the hardwood hammock, up to 40 m from hammock edge. Chemical treatments were only partially effective in decreasing <b>red</b> imported fire <b>ant</b> abundance, and the effect was short-lived.

The region of the occipital lobes that are situated nearby the midline and occipital excision appear more crease-like in S. richteri than it does in the <b>red</b> imported fire <b>ant.</b> The scapes of S. richteri are longer than they are in the <b>red</b> imported fire <b>ant,</b> and the pronotum has strong angulate shoulders. Such character is almost absent in the <b>red</b> imported fire <b>ant.</b> A shallow but sunken area is only known in the larger workers of S. richteri, which is located in the posterior region of the dorsum of the pronotum. This feature is completely absent in larger <b>red</b> imported fire <b>ant</b> workers. The <b>red</b> imported fire <b>ant's</b> promesonotum is strongly convex, whereas this feature is weakly convex in S. richteri. Upon examination, the base of the propodeum is elongated and straight in S. richteri, while convex and shorter in the <b>red</b> imported fire <b>ant.</b> It also has a wide postpetiole with either straight or diverging sides. The postpetiole in S. richteri is narrower with converging sides. In S. richteri, the transverse impression on the posterodorsal portion of the postpetiole is strong, but weak or absent in the <b>red</b> imported fire <b>ant.</b> As well as that, S. richteri workers are 15% larger than <b>red</b> imported fire <b>ant</b> workers, are blackish-brown, and have a yellow stripe on the dorsal side of the gaster.|$|R
