5|$|Muhammad sent three leading Muslims {{to bring}} him details of the <b>recent</b> <b>developments.</b> He advised the men to openly declare their findings, should they find the Banu Qurayza to be loyal, so as to {{increase}} {{the morale of the}} Muslim fighters. However, he warned against spreading the news of a possible breach of the pact on the Qurayza's part, so as to avoid any panic within Muslim ranks.|$|E

5|$|Rendall was {{succeeded in}} 1986 by Keith Starling, who further {{developed}} and expanded {{the school to}} celebrate its centenary; the £2million Cohen Building was constructed in 1991, followed by a £1.4million music centre in 1995. More <b>recent</b> <b>developments</b> include the Library Building, built in 2002, and a new sports hall in 2003; much of the construction funds was raised by parents.|$|E
5|$|Already as a teenager, Sorabji {{took great}} {{interest}} in <b>recent</b> <b>developments</b> in art music—in the work of Schoenberg, Scriabin, Mahler and Debussy, among others—at {{a time when they}} received scant attention in the United Kingdom. This interest, along with his ethnicity, cemented his reputation as an outsider. He and his music had their detractors, but some musicians received his work positively: Frederick Delius, who heard a 1930 radio broadcast of Sorabji playing his own piece Le jardin parfumé: Poem for Piano Solo, sent a letter of admiration to Sorabji; the French–Swiss pianist Alfred Cortot expressed interest in performing Sorabji's piano concertos; and Alban Berg reportedly took an interest in Sorabji's music.|$|E
5|$|Downtown Cleveland is {{centered}} on Public Square and includes {{a wide range of}} diversified districts. Downtown Cleveland is home to the traditional Financial District and Civic Center, as well as the distinct Cleveland Theater District, which is home to Playhouse Square Center. Mixed-use neighborhoods such as the Flats and the Warehouse District are occupied by industrial and office buildings as well as restaurants and bars. The number of downtown housing units in the form of condominiums, lofts, and apartments has been on the increase since 2000. <b>Recent</b> <b>developments</b> include the revival of the Flats, the Euclid Corridor Project, and the developments along East 4th Street.|$|E

5|$|Mild steel corrodes {{more readily}} than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. Carbon steel {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. <b>Recent</b> <b>developments</b> in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>recent</b> <b>developments</b> in welding {{include the}} 1958 {{breakthrough}} of electron beam welding, making deep and narrow welding possible through the concentrated heat source. Following {{the invention of}} the laser in 1960, laser beam welding debuted several decades later, and has proved to be especially useful in high-speed, automated welding. Magnetic pulse welding (MPW) is industrially used since 1967. Friction stir welding was invented in 1991 by Wayne Thomas at The Welding Institute (TWI, UK) and found high-quality applications all over the world. All of these four new processes continue to be quite expensive due the high cost of the necessary equipment, and this has limited their applications.|$|E
5|$|With the {{groundbreaking}} of the SoMa Towers project in 2012, the city entered another era of building construction. The {{largest of the}} <b>recent</b> <b>developments</b> under construction are the W Bellevue Hotel (500 Lincoln Square) and 400 Lincoln Square; both of these buildings constitute the southward expansion of Lincoln Square and stand approximately 450 feet (137 m) tall. Buildings exceeding the current 450 foot (137 m) height limit have been proposed and the city is considering raising height limits to 600 feet (183 m) to permit taller skyscrapers in the Downtown core. As of 2015, there are 24 additional buildings under construction and planned for construction in Bellevue.|$|E
