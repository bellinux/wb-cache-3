5|$|In the Belmont, Paynter led {{for most}} of the race until the final furlong when Smith came off the rail, {{allowing}} winner Union Rags to slip through and win by a neck. Paynter had already fended off two challengers during the race, and Smith had switched his whip from his <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> his left in an attempt to fend off a late challenge from Atigun; Smith considered his decision to be an error that cost him the race.|$|E

5|$|As Marge {{prepares to}} leave Vancouver, she reveals to Homer {{that she is}} left-handed, but has always used her <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> avoid seeming unusual (due to years of using her right hand, it renders her cross-dominant). She has enough dexterity to change Maggie's diaper and dress her one-handed. They return to the rink {{just in time to}} stop Seymour from {{forfeiting}} the match and go on to defeat Sweden for the gold. Agnes softens her attitude of unyielding contempt toward her son after he breaks his broom and has to drop out, and Marge and Homer agree that they had a great date night.|$|E
5|$|In round four, Judah {{landed a}} <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> the head that caused Mayweather {{to retreat to}} the ropes and cover up. The {{momentum}} changed in the fifth round, when Mayweather hurt Judah with a combination to the face. Then Mayweather landed a right hand {{on the bridge of}} Judah's nose, and blood began to flow. The seventh round was the most dominant for Mayweather to that point. Once again, he drew blood from Judah's nose. A combination from Mayweather backed Judah into a corner, and Judah's foot movement was considerably slower than it had been earlier in the fight.|$|E
5|$|Gardiner was {{the first}} goaltender who caught with his <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> win the Vezina Trophy. He is the only NHL goaltender to captain his team to a Stanley Cup victory. In 1945, Gardiner became a charter member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1998, he was ranked number 76 on The Hockey News list of the 100GreatestHockeyPlayers. Gardiner is an Honored Member of Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum, and the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame. Overall, he played 316NHLgames, winning 122, with a goals against average of 2.02goals, and 42shutouts.

5|$|India's first {{records of}} {{smallpox}} {{can be found}} in a medical book that dates back to A.D. 400. This book describes a disease that sounds exceptionally like smallpox. India, like China, created a goddess in response to its exposure to smallpox. The Hindu goddess Shitala was both worshipped and feared during her reign. It was believed that this goddess was both evil and kind and had the ability to inflict victims when angered, as well as calm the fevers of the already afflicted. Portraits of the goddess show her holding a broom in her <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> continue to move the disease and a pot of cool water in the other hand in an attempt to soothe victims. Shrines were created where many India natives, both healthy and not, went to worship and attempt to protect themselves from this disease. Some Indian women, in an attempt to ward off Shitala, placed plates of cooling foods and pots of water on the roofs of their homes.|$|E
5|$|The Brooklyn native {{began the}} busier fighter, using the jab {{and trying to}} land uppercuts {{for the first two}} rounds, while Matthysse worked on the body. In round three, a clash of heads opened a cut outside of the left eye of Judah. Matthysse {{displayed}} more aggression and became the aggressor in the third and the fourth round and Judah switched to a defensive tactic. In the next two rounds, the American boxer picked up the pace, beginning to land more combinations. The seventh round was less active but in the eight, Judah landed some hard right counter shots. Judah continued to box throughout the ninth round but Matthysse began to show more power in the tenth, focusing on the head of his opponent and knocking down the American boxer after a hard <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> the jaw. Judah got up but he was hurt, and the Argentine fighter tried to press the attack after the knockdown. However, Judah held and worked on the defensive and managed to finish the bout. Two judges scored the fight 114–113 for Judah, while the other judge scored it 114–113 for Matthysse.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{advanced}} to the NBA Finals {{for the first time}} in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who had Magic Johnson and James Worthy, two formidable opponents. The Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled an outstanding 15–2 playoff record along the way. Perhaps the best known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket. In his first Finals appearance, Jordan posted per game averages of 31.2 points on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 assists, 6.6 rebounds, 2.8 steals, and 1.4 blocks. Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award, and he cried while holding the NBA Finals trophy.|$|E

5|$|Two months later, on August 5, 2000, at the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, Judah {{defeated}} former IBF Light Welterweight Champion Terron Millett by fourth-round knockout. Judah {{was knocked}} {{down in the}} first round from a left hand. Judah rose quickly, and from that point on he dominated the fight. Judah hurt Millett with two combinations {{near the end of the}} first round. In round two, Judah sent Millett down with a <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> the chin. Millett survived the round, but he was clearly hurt. In round four, Judah charged across the ring and inflicted a series of blows on Millett, knocking him down again. Millett got up, but Judah continued his assault and knocked Millett down again. Millett rose at the count of four, but his legs were unsteady and the referee decided to stop the bout.|$|E
5|$|With about 10seconds left in {{the tenth}} round, Judah hit Mayweather with a low blow and {{followed}} it with a <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> the back of Mayweather's head. As Mayweather hopped around the ring in pain, Steele called time to give Mayweather a rest period. Mayweather's uncle and trainer, Roger Mayweather, climbed into the ring and approached Judah. Yoel Judah entered the ring and threw a punch at Roger. At that point, members of both fighters' camps entered the ring and an all-out melee ensued. More than a dozen security officers and police officers rushed into the ring and managed to control the situation. After the ring was cleared, Roger Mayweather was ejected from the fight. Mayweather cruised through the last two rounds {{on his way to}} a unanimous decision victory by scores of 116–112, 117–111 and 119–109.|$|E
5|$|Debates are {{punctuated with}} {{vigorous}} gestures which enliven the ambience of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing {{the back of his}} <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E

50|$|Holt won {{his next}} two fights in New Jersey, before moving down to light welterweight {{to take on}} 1996 US Olympian David Díaz on February 4, 2005, at the Foxwoods Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut. Holt caught Díaz with a whip-like left hook to the head {{followed}} by a sharp <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> that dropped him in round one along with opening a cut around his right eye. Diaz finally found the range in the seventh round and floored Holt with two <b>right</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> the head. Holt survived the knockdown {{and in the next}} round, stunned Díaz with a blistering five-punch volley of left hooks and <b>right</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> the face. Diaz retreated on wobbly legs; however, Holt continued to unload with both hands and connected with another sharp flurry of shots. The referee had seen enough and stopped the fight, awarding Holt an upset technical knockout victory.|$|R
5|$|Rice is {{the staple}} diet, while fish is an {{integral}} component of coastal South Indian meals. Coconut and spices are used extensively in South Indian cuisine. The region has a rich cuisine involving both traditional non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes comprising rice, legumes and lentils. Its distinct aroma and flavour is achieved by the blending of flavourings and spices including curry leaves, mustard seeds, coriander, ginger, garlic, chili, pepper, cinnamon, cloves, green cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, coconut and rosewater. The traditional way of eating a meal involves being seated on the floor, having the food served on a banana leaf and using clean fingers of the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> take the food into the mouth. After the meal, the fingers are washed; the easily degradable banana leaf is discarded or becomes fodder for cattle. Eating on banana leaves is a custom thousands of years old, imparts a unique flavor to the food and is considered healthy. Idli, dosa, uthappam, appam, pongal and paniyaram are popular dishes for breakfast. Rice is served with sambar, rasam and poriyal for lunch. Andhra cuisine is characterised by pickles and spicy curries. Chettinad cuisine is famous for non-vegetarian items and Hyderabadi cuisine is popular for its biryani.|$|E
