Prevention of these is important for bladder healing. We studied the influence of photosensitizer concentration, irradiation parameters, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the photodynamically induced damage in the porcine urothelium invitro. The aim {{was to determine the}} threshold conditions for the cell survival. METHODS: Living porcine bladder mucosae were incubated with solution of hexylester of 5 -aminolevulinic acid (HAL). The mucosae were irradiated with increasing doses and cell alterations were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and by Sytox green fluorescence. The urothelial survival score was correlated with Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) photobleaching and intracellular fluorescence of Rhodamine 123 reflecting the ROS production. RESULTS: The mortality ratio was dependent on PpIX concentration. After 3 hours of incubation, the threshold <b>radiant</b> <b>exposures</b> for blue light were 0. 15 and 0. 75 J/cm(2) (irradiance 30 and 75 mW/cm(2), respectively) and for white light 0. 55 J/cm(2) (irradiance 30 mW/cm(2)). Photobleaching rate increased with decreasing irradiance. Interestingly, the DHR 123 /R 123 reporter system correlated well with the threshold exposures under all conditions used. CONCLUSIONS: We have determined <b>radiant</b> <b>exposures</b> sparing half of normal urothelial cells.

The destructive effect of the radiation is multiplied manifold by propagation of bond breakage and the formation of hydroperoxides that further absorb solar ultraviolet radiation.

40|$|Laser {{therapy for}} {{cutaneous}} hypervascular malformations such as port-wine stain birthmarks is currently not feasible for dark-skinned individuals. We study {{the effects of}} pulse duration, <b>radiant</b> <b>exposure,</b> and cryogen spray cooling (CSC) on the thermal response of skin, using a Monte Carlo based optical-thermal model. Thermal injury to the epidermis decreases with increasing pulse duration during irradiation at a constant radiant exposure; however, maintaining vascular injury requires that the <b>radiant</b> <b>exposure</b> also increase. At short pulse durations, only a minimal increase in <b>radiant</b> <b>exposure</b> is necessary for a therapeutic effect to be achieved because thermal diffusion from the vessels is minimal.

Study Design/Materials and Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of 64 patients with PWS treated with the ScleroPLUS(R) [Candela (Wayland, MA) ] pulsed dye laser (lambda = 585 or 595 nm wavelength; spot size 7 mm, tau(P) = 1, 500 microseconds) over a 3 -year period. Subjects' ages ranged between 3 months and 64 years; there were 42 females and 22 males, all of whom were Asian. Number of treatments ranged from 1 to 6. Duration of treatment ranged from 6 months to 2 years 11 months, with a mean of 12 months. Patients (n = 32) received CSC-LT (585 nm) using <b>radiant</b> <b>exposures</b> of 7 - 10 J/cm(2). A second group of patients (n = 32) received CSC-LT (595 nm) using <b>radiant</b> <b>exposures</b> of 7 - 10 J/cm(2). The primary efficacy measurement was the quantitative assessment of blanching response scores for CSC-LT (585 nm) versus CSC-LT (595 nm). Patients were monitored for adverse effects. Results: Based on chi-squared analysis, there were clinical, and statistically significant, differences in blanching response scores favoring PWS receiving CSC-LT (585 nm) as compared to CSC-LT (595 nm) (P <. 001). Transient hyperpigmentation was noted in 43. 7 % (n = 14) and 37. 5 % (n = 12) of patients in the CSC-LT (585 nm) and CSC-LT (595 nm) groups, respectively. In both groups, transient hyperpigmentation resolved in all patients within 1 year. Permanent hypopigmentation or scarring was not observed in either group. Conclusions: CSC-LT (585 nm) resulted in superior blanching as compared to CSC-LT (595 nm).

These experiments show that these changes are a function of <b>radiant</b> <b>exposure.</b> Interestingly, it is observed that PL loss is accompanied by a change of the profile height for WS 2 monolayers. In order to explore the fundamental mechanism for PL and height variations, laser irradiation was applied to monolayer WS 2 flakes with varying <b>radiant</b> <b>exposure</b> to obtain PL maps, under the absence and presence of oxygen, H 2 O and nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere.

40|$|Abstract— Cellular {{autofluorescence}} spectra were monitored in a single‐beam {{gradient force}} optical trap (“optical tweezers”) {{in order to}} probe the physiological effects of near infrared and UVA (320 – 400 nm) microirradiation. Prior to trapping, Chinese hamster ovary cells exhibited weak UVA‐excited autofluorescence with maxima at 455 nm characteristic of β‐nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) emission. No strong effect of a 1064 nm NIR microbeam on fluorescence intensity and spectral characteristics was found during trapping, even for power densities up to 70 MW/cm 2 and <b>radiant</b> <b>exposures</b> of 100 GJ/cm 2. In contrast to the 1064 nm trap, a 760 nm trapping beam caused a two‐fold autofluorescence increase within 5 min (about 20 GJ/cm 2). Exposure to 365 nm UVA (1 W/cm 2) during 1064 nm trapping significantly altered cellular autofluorescence, causing, within 10 min, a five‐fold increase and a 6 nm red shift versus initial levels. We conclude that 1064 nm microbeams can be applied {{for an extended period}} without producing autofluorescence changes characteristic of alterations in the cellular redox state. However, 760 nm effects may occur via a two‐photon absorption mechanism, which, {{in a manner similar to}} UVA exposure, alters the redox balance and places the cell in a state of oxidative stress.

After the students had received one session of additional instruc-tion and immediate feedback using the MARC-PS, they delivered 35 percent more light energy to the same simulated restoration. Students who were closer to graduation showed a greater improvement in their light-curing technique (p= 0. 0091) ...|$|E
40|$|To gain a {{thorough}} {{knowledge of the}} solar energy resources on the Tibetan Plateau, measured and modeled solar irradiance levels on the Plateau from July 2010 to September 2013 are considered. The Tibetan Plateau lies in southwest China between 27. 3 °N and 36. 4 °N at an average altitude exceeding 4500 meters, where the amount of overhead atmosphere is reduced to almost {{one half of the}} amount at sea level. The combination of low solar zenith angles with low atmospheric attenuation and good weather gives high solar radiation levels, which could be exploited by solar power plants. To quantify irradiance levels as well as their spatial and temporal variations, pyranometer measurements of the solar irradiance were recorded every minute throughout the years 2010 to 2013 in Lhasa (29. 6 °N, 91. 2 °E, 3683 m), Nagqu (31. 5 °N, 92. 1 °E, 4510 m), Tingri (28. 7 °N, 87. 1 °E, 4335 m), and Nyingchi (29. 7 °N, 94. 7 °E, 2995 m). The high irradiance values (around 1200 to 1300 W m^- 2) at the Tibetan Plateau are found to be comparable with those at the Top of the Atmosphere (TOA) (1300 W m^- 2). The yearly solar energy received by a horizontal surface is found to be about 7. 6 GJ m^- 2 in Lhasa and 6. 8 GJ m^- 2 in Nagchu. As expected, the highest irradiance values are observed at around 06 : 00 UTC (local noon), and the daily <b>radiant</b> <b>exposure</b> on a clear winter day is only about 54 % of that on a clear mid summer day. Based on the monthly averaged daily <b>radiant</b> <b>exposure,</b> Tingri has the best solar energy resource of the four sites and Nyingchi has the lowest. Lhasa has a richer solar energy resource than Nagchu. A radiative transfer model (AccuRT (Hamre et al., 2014)) is used to examine the air quality by comparing modeled results with spectral radiometer measurements recorded during one day at two sites in mainland China and two sites in Tibet. The retrieved spectral transmittances show that the atmosphere above the two sites in Tibet is much more transparent than that above the sites in mainland China. Applying AccuRT, we also found out the weather has a more significant impact on the yearly <b>radiant</b> <b>exposure</b> (up to 23 % variation between the four sites) than latitude (2 % variation) or altitude (2 % variation). Finally, sensitivity of irradiance levels due to variations in the aerosol and cloud optical depths were investigated. The yearly <b>radiant</b> <b>exposure</b> was reduced by aerosols by about 3 % to 6 % for typical aerosol optical depths in Tibet (0. 17 - 0. 27 at 580 nm). The combined effect of aerosols and clouds reduced the yearly <b>radiant</b> <b>exposure</b> by 15 % in Lhasa and 23 % in Nagchu. To cover the yearly power consumption in the Lhasa region, about 5. 3 to 5. 9 km^ 2 of horizontally oriented solar panels are necessary assuming a light-electricity transformation efficiency of 16 % (Narbel et al., 2014) and a yearly <b>radiant</b> <b>exposure</b> of 7. 6 and 6. 8 GJ m^- 2, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Different {{irradiation}} protocols {{are proposed}} to polymerize dental resins, and discordances remain concerning {{their impact on}} the material. To improve this knowledge, we studied entrapment of free radicals in unfilled Bis-GMA/TEGDMA (50 : 50 wt%) resin after light cure. The tested hypothesis was that various irradiation parameters (curing time, irradiance, and <b>radiant</b> <b>exposure)</b> and different irradiation modes (continuous and pulse-delay) led to different amounts of trapped free radicals. The analysis of cured samples (n = 3) by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) revealed that the concentrations of trapped free radicals significantly differed according to the curing protocol. When continuous modes with similar <b>radiant</b> <b>exposure</b> were compared, higher concentrations of trapped free radicals were measured for longer times with lower irradiance. Concerning pulse modes, the delay had no influence on trapped radical concentration. These results give new insights into the understanding of the photopolymerization process and highlight the relevance of using EPR when studying polymerization of dimethacrylate-based materials...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of different durations of skin temperature manipulation on pacing patterns and performance during a 15 -km cycling time trial. Nineteen well-trained men completed three 15 -km cycling time trials in 18 °C and 50 % relative humidity with 4. 5 -km (short-heat), 9. 0 -km (long-heat) or without (control) <b>radiant</b> heat <b>exposure</b> applied by infrared heaters after 1. 5 km in the time trial. During the time trials, power output, mean skin temperature, rectal temperature, heart rate and rating of perceived exertion were assessed. The <b>radiant</b> heat <b>exposure</b> resulted in higher mean skin temperature during the time trial for short-heat (35. 0 ± 0. 6 °C) and long-heat (35. 3 ± 0. 5 °C) than for control (32. 5 ± 1. 0 °C; P < 0. 001), whereas rectal temperature was similar (P = 0. 55). The mean power output was less for short-heat (273 ± 8 W; P = 0. 001) and long-heat (271 ± 9 W; P = 0. 02) than for control (287 ± 7 W), but pacing patterns did not differ (P = 0. 55).

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} the maximum {{permissible}} exposure (MPE) limits for near-infrared (NIR) laser exposures are analyzed in light of nonlinear optical phenomena. We have evaluated the thresholds for supercontinuum (SC) generation for ultra-short (femtosecond) laser exposures in the NIR region and compared these values with the MPEs listed in the American National Standard for Safe Use of Lasers 2014 Edition (ANSI Z 136. 1 - 2014). Due to the strong increase in ocular absorption in the 1. 2 to 1. 4 micrometer (i. e. 1200 - 1400 nm) range, evaluation of the SC generation phenomenon is necessary because any shift in laser energy within the eye to shorter wavelengths (i. e. greater frequency) could lead to unforeseen increases in hazards to the retina. The findings of this research do in fact indicate a shift in laser energy to shorter wavelengths for femtosecond pulsed lasers. In addition, an analysis involving spectral measurements through a water cuvette leads to estimations involving the eye configuration that show <b>radiant</b> <b>exposures</b> exceeding the ANSI thresholds for visible wavelengths. The implications of these findings are such that enough NIR energy is converted to visible energy near the retina when dealing with femtosecond pulsed lasers, warranting further studies in examining what the effects caused by nonlinear optical phenomena due to ultrashort pulsed lasers have on MPE thresholds established for eye safety...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{cryotherapy}} {{is still}} the first-line therapy for solar lentigines, because of the side effects such as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), especially in patients with darker skin types, pigment-specific lasers {{should be considered as}} a therapy for initial treatment. Aim: The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the efficacy and safety of cryotherapy compared with 595 -nm pulsed dye laser (PDL) with cutaneous compression in the treatment of solar lentigines. Materials and Methods: Twenty-two patients (skin type II&# 8722;IV) with facial or hand lentigines participated in this study. Lesions of one side of the face or each hand were randomly assigned and treated with either cryotherapy or PDL. Treatments were performed with <b>radiant</b> <b>exposures</b> of 10 J/cm 2, 7 -mm spot size and 1. 5 ms pulse duration with no epidermal cooling. Photographs were taken before treatment and 1 -month later. The response rate and side effects were compared. Results: PDL was more likely to produce substantial lightening of the solar lentigines than cryotherapy, especially in skin type III and IV (n = 8, n = 9; P 0. 05). PIH was seen only in cryotherapy group. PDL group had only minimal erythema. No purpura was observed. Conclusion: PDL with compression is superior to cryotherapy in the treatment of solar lentigines in darker skin types...|$|R
