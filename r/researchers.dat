40|$|We {{describe}} the insights and challenges offered by <b>researcher</b> participation in in-the-wild studies through {{the comparison of}} two prototype evaluations with varying levels of <b>researcher</b> participation. By reflecting on these studies we expose different facets of the <b>researcher's</b> role when interacting with participants in in-the-wild studies.

40|$|This {{article is}} based on a {{community-based}} research practicum conducted with a Headstart program in western Canada. The purpose of the text is to describe the progression of one <b>researcher’s</b> roles from inception to completion of a year-long research project while working in collaboration with a community partner. Following a brief review of principles of community-based research, a case study is used to show how principles were adhered to in a practicum. A variation of traditional role theory is introduced as a useful framework to navigate burgeoning <b>researcher</b> roles and role multiplicity. These are: (a) <b>researcher</b> as <b>researcher,</b> (b) <b>researcher</b> as collaborator, (c) <b>researcher</b> as relationship builder, (d) <b>researcher</b> as teacher, and (e) <b>researcher</b> as learner. Considerations for ways to promote researchers—students and academics—to develop skills to correspond with changing <b>researcher</b> roles are presented, along with future directions to empirically examin...|$|R

5|$|The {{empirical}} {{rejection of}} the unbiasedness hypothesis is a well-recognized puzzle among finance <b>researchers.</b> Empirical evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and the future spot rate is mixed. <b>Researchers</b> have published papers demonstrating empirical failure of the hypothesis by conducting regression analyses of the realized changes in spot exchange rates on forward premiums and finding negative slope coefficients. These <b>researchers</b> offer numerous rationales for such failure. One rationale centers around the relaxation of risk neutrality, while still assuming rational expectations, such that a foreign exchange risk premium may exist that can account for differences between the forward rate and the future spot rate.|$|E

30|$|The {{structure}} of our data collection procedure {{may be the}} single most important source of threats to our observations. First, there is the issue of using a single seed to start the process, along with the selection of the seed research. While designing the present study, we have decided to build a closed graph of connections, on which every <b>researcher</b> indicating someone or being indicated by someone should comply with our definition of young Brazilian software engineering <b>researcher.</b> Therefore, our seed <b>researcher</b> could not be a senior <b>researcher</b> or a foreigner young and prominent <b>researcher.</b> Thus, we decided to select a seed <b>researcher</b> who would probably end up being indicated as prominent. The selected seed was an independent and unanimous selection of all authors of this paper. In fact, the seed <b>researcher</b> became the most indicated <b>researcher</b> of our selected group.|$|R
