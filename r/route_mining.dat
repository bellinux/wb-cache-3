40|$|As {{travel is}} taking more {{significant}} part in our life, route recommendation service becomes {{a big business}} and attracts many major players in IT industry. Given a pair of user-specified origin and destination, a route recommendation service aims to provide users with the routes of best travelling experience according to criteria, such as travelling distance, travelling time, traffic condition, etc. However, previous research shows that even the routes recommended by the big-thumb service providers can deviate significantly from the routes travelled by experienced drivers. It means travellers 2 ̆ 7 preferences on route selection are influenced by many latent and dynamic factors {{that are hard to}} model exactly with pre-defined formulas. In this work we approach this challenging problem with a very different perspective- leveraging crowds 2 ̆ 7 knowledge to improve the recommendation quality. In this light, CrowdPlanner - a novel crowd-based route recommendation system has been developed, which requests human workers to evaluate candidate routes recommended by different sources and methods, and determine the best route based on their feedbacks. In this paper, we particularly focus on two important issues that affect system performance significantly: (1) how to efficiently generate tasks which are simple to answer but possess sufficient information to derive user-preferred routes; and (2) how to quickly identify a set of appropriate domain experts to answer the questions timely and accurately. Specifically, the task generation component in our system generates a series of informative and concise questions with optimized ordering for a given candidate route set so that workers feel comfortable and easy to answer. In addition, the worker selection component utilizes a set of selection criteria and an efficient algorithm to find the most eligible workers to answer the questions with high accuracy. A prototype system has been deployed to many voluntary mobile clients and extensive tests on real-scenario queries have shown the superiority of CrowdPlanner in comparison with the results given by map services and popular <b>route</b> <b>mining</b> algorithms...|$|E

3000|$|Route Recommendation Algorithms The popular <b>routes</b> <b>mining</b> has {{received}} tremendous research interests {{for a decade}} and a lot of works are on it, such as [5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 22, 23, 28, 29, 32, 33]. Among these works, [3, 4, 15, 31] are the most representative. Chen et al. [4] propose a novel popularity function for path desirability evaluation using historical trajectory data sets. The popular routes recommended by it tend to have fewer vertices. The work in [31] provides k popular <b>routes</b> by <b>mining</b> uncertain trajectories. The recommendation routes of this work tend to be rough routes instead of correct routes. [15] claims the popular routes change with time, so it carries out a popular <b>routes</b> <b>mining</b> algorithms which can provide the recommended routes in arbitrary time periods specified by the users. [3] provides the evidences that the routes recommended by web services are sometimes different from drivers’ preference. Thus, it mines the individual popular routes from his historical trajectories. The recommended routes of this method reflect certain people’s preference.|$|R
5000|$|The Kingdom of Makuria (perhaps Old Nubian: , Dotawo; Greek: , Makouria; مقرة, al-Muqurra) was {{a kingdom}} located {{in what is}} today Northern Sudan and Southern Egypt. Makuria {{originally}} covered the area along the Nile River from the Third Cataract to somewhere between the Fifth and Sixth Cataracts. It also had control over the trade <b>routes,</b> <b>mines,</b> and oases {{to the east and}} west. Its capital was Dongola (Arabic: [...] ), and the kingdom is sometimes known by the name of its capital.|$|R
50|$|Off-route mines are {{designed}} to be effective when detonated next to a vehicle instead of underneath the vehicle. They are useful in cases where the ground or surface is not suitable for burying or concealing a mine. They normally employ a Misznay-Schardin shaped charge to fire a penetrating slug through the target armour. This self forging projectile principle has been used for some French and Soviet off <b>route</b> <b>mines</b> and has earned infamy as an improvised explosive devices (IED) technique in Israel and especially Iraq.|$|R
50|$|Haskins Street (named after a {{prominent}} {{family in the}} town prior to independence) was the first tarred road in Botswana. Since 1966, the city has grown significantly due mainly to active cross-border trading with Rhodesia/Zimbabwe, in 1997, Francistown became a city, Botswana’s 2nd after Gaborone. With the city located astride Botswana’s main road and rail transport <b>routes,</b> <b>mining,</b> commerce and agriculture have been essential parts of its economy. Tati Nickel, The Dumela Industrial Complex and Botswana Meat Commission are the main economic drivers in the city. Government departments and other private entities also boost the wellbeing of the area’s residents.|$|R
30|$|To {{consider}} {{the diversity of}} the preference factors simultaneously, some previous studies propose to use popular <b>routes</b> <b>mined</b> from historical trajectories as recommended routes. This approach, however, has significant drawbacks. First, it is not always possible to have a sufficient amount of historical trajectories to derive reliable route recommendation. Second, there exists a number of popular route-mining algorithms. The definitions of popularity in those algorithms slightly differ from each other, which can suggest different routes for users. As a result, it is still difficult for users to select one particular route as a best choice. For example, Fig.  1 a shows different popular <b>routes</b> <b>mined</b> using different algorithms. In this experiment, we first randomly select 5000 source–destination pairs as the testing queries. For each of them, we test the similarity between the route recommended by a big-thumb Web map service (WS) and the route obtained from three popular route-mining algorithms, namely most popular route (MPR) [4], local driver route (LDR) [3] and most frequent path (MFP) [15], all of which perform reasonably well according to their reported results. The results of average similarity are shown in Fig.  1. One can see that the similarities are at best around 60  %, which means that different sources recommend quite different routes. Figure  1 b demonstrates the recommended routes from different sources on map, where two routes recommended by WS are different from those by MPR and MFP, respectively.|$|R

His {{intention was to}} let Germany know that the Irish public know, and [...] "they don't like it". There had been a British proposal for transshipment. [...] William Warnock, the Irish chargé d'affaires in Berlin told Germany that Ireland was refusing to transship British cargoes, while protesting against the attacks on Irish ships, and other neutral ships with Irish cargoes. Deliberate attacks on cross-channel shipping ceased on 5 November 1941, when the collier Glencree was strafed. There were attacks on other <b>routes.</b> <b>Mines</b> were a constant danger.|$|R

50|$|The August Passage is {{the main}} {{communication}} and transportation <b>route</b> in the <b>mine.</b> It runs from the east {{to the west of}} mine, connecting in a straight line the bottom ends of the Campi and Sutoris shafts.

Its first part, extending between the Rabsztyn Chute and a Campi Shaft, was built in the years 1723-1743, in accordance with a design by Jan Gottfried Borlach. His great achievements was to regulate <b>routes</b> in the <b>mine</b> by ensuring their straightening and leveling.

Both lakes were drained until the explosives had been removed. The quarry was worked on seven levels, but the three below the adit level are now flooded.
