The proceedings contains a {{a wide range of}} papers that cover current and new memory technologies including Flash memories, Magnetic Random Access Memories (MRAM and GMRAM), Ferro-electric RAM (FeRAM), and Chalcogenide <b>RAM</b> (<b>CRAM).</b> The papers presented in the proceedings address the use of these technologies for space applications as well as radiation effects and packaging issues...|$|E
40|$|The {{architecture}} {{and implementation of}} a Computational <b>RAM</b> (<b>CRAM)</b> controller is presented. The design interfaces the CRAM to the PCI bus. CRAM macroinstructions are issued by the host processor through the PCI bus onto the CRAM controller instruction FIFO. These macroinstructions act as address pointers to the CRAM control store, which contains the lowest-level CRAM microinstruction routines. A read/write buffer and an instruction FIFO increase performance by reducing bus transaction delays and avoiding the need to synchronize PCI bus transactions to CRAM operations. The controller programming model is also described. A prototype CRAM controller has been implemented in a Xilinx XC 4013 E- 2 FPGA, and is currently being used in building a prototype CRAM system in a PC environment. 1. Introduction Computational RAM [1 - 2] is a SIMD-memory hybrid architecture, with 1 -bit processing elements (PE) integrated at the sense amplifiers of a standard DRAM/ SRAM (Fig. 1 a). This architecture improve [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Understanding how {{the brain}} captures {{transient}} experience and converts it into long lasting changes in neural circuits requires the identification and investigation of the specific ensembles of neurons {{that are responsible for}} the encoding of each experience. We have developed a Robust Activity Marking (RAM) system that allows for the identification and interrogation of ensembles of neurons. The RAM system provides unprecedented high sensitivity and selectivity through the use of an optimized synthetic activity-regulated promoter that is strongly induced by neuronal activity and a modified Tet-Off system that achieves improved temporal control. Due to its compact design, RAM can be packaged into a single adeno-associated virus (AAV), providing great versatility and ease of use, including application to mice, rats, flies, and potentially many other species. Cre-dependent <b>RAM,</b> <b>CRAM,</b> allows for the study of active ensembles of a specific cell type and anatomical connectivity, further expanding the RAM systemâ€™s versatility.
