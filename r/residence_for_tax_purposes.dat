The company was founded with British and Belgian capital and was based in Belgium. By 1898 there were no longer any British shareholders and the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company {{changed its name to}} the Abir Congo Company and changed its <b>residence</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> to the Free State. The company was granted a large concession in the north of the country and the rights to tax the inhabitants. This tax was taken in the form of rubber obtained from a relatively rare rubber vine. The collection system revolved around a series of trade posts along the two main rivers in the concession. Each post was commanded by a European agent and manned with armed sentries to enforce taxation and punish any rebels.|$|E

40|$|In an {{increasingly}} integrated global economy, with rising cross-border stock listings and share ownership, U.

40|$|Dual {{residence}} in the taxation of individuals Each country {{has the right to}} determine on which grounds and to what extent it exercises its tax authority. In the case of individuals a country usually bases its right to levy taxes on the connection between the country and the individual, or the country and the income or wealth in question. This thesis deals with the connection that exists between the country and the individual. Under domestic tax law systems a separation is usually made into full and limited tax liability. Full tax liability arises when there are strong ties between the individual and the state. Residence is usually considered a strong tie that results in full tax liability. A person who is resident in a country, and therefore subject to full tax liability, is usually taxed on his world wide income. However, if the person is not resident, the state does not claim the right to tax the individual as such, but taxes income that arises within the territory of the country. When determining {{residence in}} one country, no consideration is given to whether the person is also resident in other countries. Consequently, individuals can as a result of cross border movement be considered resident both in the country of arrival and the country of departure. When two countries both consider an individual resident, dual residence arises. The purpose of this thesis is to analyse three aspects of dual residence. First and foremost, national rules on residence will be analysed, as well as how dual residence occurs in practice. Secondly, the rules on how to determine <b>tax</b> <b>residence</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> treaty <b>purposes</b> are discussed. Thirdly, the tax consequences of dual residence will be investigated. The emphasis will be on the first two aspects of dual residence mentioned. The thesis is based on a dogmatic approach to legal research. Some elements of comparative methods of research are also present. A person who is resident in Finland is subject to full tax liability in Finland. <b>Residence</b> <b>for</b> income <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> is determined in the income tax act (ITA) § 11. According to ITA § 11 a person is resident in Finland if he has his main abode and home in Finland, stays over six months in Finland or falls under the three-year rule. Finnish nationals who leave Finland are {{as a result of the}} three-year rule considered resident the year of departure and the three following years. Limited tax liability can arise before the three- year period ends if the individual can produce evidence that he lacks substantial ties to Finland. The Finnish rules on residence are partly problematic. The rules on when a visit to Finland has fulfilled the six months requirement are unclear. Also, the three-year rule does not specify what a substantial tie is. The three-year rule furthermore distinguishes between Finnish nationals and foreign nationals. Different tax consequences depending on nationality can be problematic from an EU perspective. A short analysis of the current ECJ cases, however, indicates that the three-year rule is probably in conformity with EU law. Residence is also used to determine <b>tax</b> liability <b>for</b> the <b>purpose</b> of other <b>taxes,</b> such as the gift and inheritance tax, car tax, municipal tax and social security contributions. Each above-mentioned tax has its own notion of residence. The different concepts of residence are compared with the residence concept that is used <b>for</b> income <b>tax</b> <b>purposes.</b> The comparison led to the observation that the <b>residence</b> concept <b>for</b> income <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> can impact on the other residence concepts. Usually <b>residence</b> <b>for</b> other <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> does not impact on the <b>residence</b> status <b>for</b> income <b>tax</b> <b>purposes.</b> However, the <b>tax</b> authorities claim that belonging to the Finnish social security system is a substantial tie according to the three-year rule. The Finnish rules on <b>residence</b> <b>for</b> income <b>tax</b> <b>purposes</b> are in many ways interesting in comparison to other countries rules on residence. A comparison has been made with Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, the United Kingdom and the USA. Most of the above-mentioned countries have fairly recently amended and modernized their rules on residence. The comparison demonstrates that the Finnish rules on residence are outdated and in need of reformation. For instance, nationality does not carry any weight when determining tax liability in most other countries (except for the USA). When a Finnish national moves abroad, he is usually subject to full tax liability in the country of arrival, and at the same time subject to full tax liability in Finland due to the three-year rule. The resulting dual residence is solved by tax treaty, provided that the countries have concluded a treaty. <b>For</b> <b>tax</b> treaty <b>purposes</b> a person can only have one tax treaty residence at a time. <b>Residence</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> treaty <b>purposes</b> is determined through the tie breaker in article 4 (2). The state of residence has the primary right to tax the individual. The tie breaker is, however, problematic, since the criteria on which residence is decided are partly ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways. Therefore the general rules on tax treaty interpretation have to be considered. Rules on tax treaty interpretation can be found in domestic legislation, international law, the Vienna convention, article 3 (2) of tax treaties, and in the commentaries to the model tax convention. Some of the rules on interpretation can lead to different outcomes. The parties can also have diverging information about the individual s personal circumstances. Therefore it is possible that two countries cannot reach an agreement on which country should be the individual s state of residence according to article 4. When both countries claim to be the state of residence, the conflict shall be settled by the mutual agreement procedure in article 25 of the tax treaty. The mutual agreement procedure is time consuming and results cannot be guaranteed. In Finland there are no publications by the tax authorities on the mutual agreement procedure, and the procedure is hence not very well known. Therefore, I have tried to describe how the mutual agreement procedure is executed in practice. In 2008 the OECD added an arbitration clause to its model convention as a final means to solve tax treaty disputes that have not been solved by the mutual agreement procedure. Finland has not, however, included the clause in its treaties. Dual residence can result in several different consequences for the taxation of individuals, and the possible consequences are analysed in this thesis. The taxation of dual resident individuals can vary greatly from one situation to another depending on domestic legislation in both countries of residence, the type of income, the source of income, the tax treaties articles and the interpretation of the tax treaty. The taxation of dual resident persons can be divided into situations where no tax treaty has been concluded, a tax treaty exists and Finland is not the state of residence, and situations where both countries claim residence status according to the tax treaty. Some Finnish tax treaties include the three-year rule in article 23. According to the clause the source country is granted a more comprehensive, but secondary, right to tax persons who are resident according to domestic tax law, although the <b>residence</b> state <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> treaty <b>purposes</b> is in the other country. To demonstrate the impact of dual residence on the taxation of individuals, the taxation in Finland of interest, dividend, capital gains, salary and pensions is described through practical examples. Situations of dual residence can also have other tax implications, e. g. is there a progressive impact on other income, and how are deductions and losses taken into account when Finland is not the state of residence according to article 4 ? Dual residence does not necessarily cause double taxation as a result of national rules on credit and exemption and the elimination of double taxation. The concluding chapter sheds light on some of the most urgent problems in the current legislation on residence and presents some suggestions for improvements. The rules on {{residence in the}} domestic income tax act are scrutinized in detail. It is suggested that the nationality criterion in the three-year rule is abolished, and that substantial ties are defined in the income tax act. Furthermore, it is also suggested that the national rules on the elimination of double taxation are elucidated and that the scale of application is extended. On the international level it is recommended that article 3 (2) in the OECD model tax convention is amended to primarily recommend an interpretation according to the context. Some minor adjustments are also presented to the articles on residence and mutual agreement. Varje stat får självständigt reglera utsträckningen av och kriterierna för sin beskattningsbehörighet. I fråga om fysiska personer baserar sig statens beskattningsbehörighet vanligen på antingen anknytningar mellan staten och den skattskyldige eller anknytningar mellan staten och skatteobjektet. Denna forskning tar sin utgångspunkt i förhållandet mellan den skattskyldige och en stat. I Finland gör man en uppdelning i allmänt och begränsat skattskyldiga personer. En person som enligt inkomstskattelagen är bosatt i Finland anses vara allmänt skattskyldig, och beskattas således för sina globala inkomster. Alla andra är begränsat skattskyldiga, och beskattas bara för inkomst med sin källa i Finland. Andra länder har vanligen motsvarande regler. Således kan det vid gränsöverskridande rörlighet hända att avfärdslandet anser att den skattskyldige fortsättningsvis är skatterättsligt bosatt där, medan allmän skattskyldighet aktualiseras i det nya vistelselandet. Om två länder samtidigt anser att en och samma person är bosatt och allmänt skattskyldig i landet i fråga uppstår dubbelboende. I denna forskning granskas tre skeden av dubbelboende. Först behandlas hur boende enligt nationell rätt och dubbelboende uppstår. För det andra analyseras hur dubbelboendekonflikter löses genom bestämmandet av hemvist i de fall då skatteavtal ingåtts. För det tredje redogörs för de skattekonsekvenser dubbelboendesituationer får. Boken avslutas med förslag för hur nationell och internationell rätt kunde utvecklas...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{develops}} {{a framework for}} the study of the unique effects of corporate inversions (meaning, a change in corporate <b>residence</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes)</b> in the jurisdictions from which corporations invert (“home jurisdictions”). Currently, empirical literature on corporate inversions overstates its policy implications. It is frequently argued that in response to an uncompetitive tax environment, corporations may relocate their headquarters for tax purposes, which, in turn, may result in the loss of positive economic attributes in the home jurisdiction (such as capital expenditures, research and development activity, and high-quality jobs). The association of tax-residence relocation with the dislocation of meaningful economic attributes, however, is not empirically supported and is theoretically tenuous. The Article uses case studies to fill this gap. Based on observed factors, the Article develops grounded propositions that may describe the meaningful effects of inversions in home jurisdictions. The case studies suggest that whether tax-relocation is associated with the dislocation of meaningful economic attributes is a highly contextualized question. It seems, however, that inversions are more likely to be associated with dislocation of meaningful attributes when non-tax factors support the decision to invert. This suggests that policymakers should be able to draft tax-residence rules that exert non-tax costs on corporate locational decisions in order to prevent tax-motivated inversions...|$|E
40|$|The paper empirically {{analyses}} {{the impact}} on individual municipalities of replacing the German local business tax by a local surcharge on income and corporation tax. The microsimulation models used for this and refined for the present paper originate in calculations carried out for the Federal Ministry of Finance in cooperation between the Federal Statistical Office and the Humboldt University in Berlin. The data basis is formed by the roughly 30 million individual data sets of the most up-to-date income and local business tax statistics provided by the Federal Statistical Office. A local surcharge tax which, like the BDI/VCI model analysed, assigns tax revenue incurred on profits to the municipality of permanent establishment and that on other income to the domicile municipality, affects the revenue situtation of the municipalities in highly differing ways. The losers in such a local tax reform include those municipalities in which an above-average number of industrial and commercial enterprises are resident. These are the "core towns" of the Old Federal Laender in particular. By contrast, the revenue situtation of the surrounding municipalities and of the municipalities with a rural character would considerably improve on average. However, the core towns in the New Federal Laender which are currently tax-weak because they have little industry would also improve their revenue situation in most cases by applying a sucharge tax. In {{order to maintain the}} financial status quo, the core towns in the Old Federal Laender in particular would have to levy relatively high local tax rates, whilst the surrounding municipalities would be able to become more attractive by applying tax rates which as a rule would be much lower. The consequence of this would be that high-income earners in the core towns would have a not inconsiderable incentive to change their place to <b>residence</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>purposes,</b> which would further worsen the financial situation of the core towns.
