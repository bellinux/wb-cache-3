25|$|Of the {{estimated}} 200,000 animal species in Australia, about 96% are invertebrates. While {{the full extent}} of invertebrate diversity is uncertain, 90% of insects and molluscs are considered endemic. Invertebrates occupy many ecological niches and are important in all ecosystems as decomposers, pollinators, and food sources. The largest group of invertebrates is the insects, comprising 75% of Australia's known species of animals. The most diverse insect orders are the Coleoptera, with 28,200 species of beetles and weevils, the Lepidoptera with 20,816 species including butterflies and moths, and around 14,800 species of Hymenoptera, including the ants, bees and wasps. Order Diptera, which includes the flies and mosquitoes,comprises 7,786 species. Order Hemiptera, including bugs, aphids and hoppers, comprises 5,650 species; and there are 2,827 species of order Orthoptera, including grasshoppers, crickets and katydids. Introduced species that pose a significant threat to native species include the European wasp, the <b>red</b> <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> the yellow crazy ant and feral honeybees which compete with native bees.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of invasive species, mainly the <b>red</b> <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> {{has been known}} to disrupt the beetle’s environment. Shallow caves in which the beetle live are relatively easy to enter and make them vulnerable to invasion of fire ants and other exotic species. Fire ant colonies occur in two different forms: single-queen colonies and multiple-queen colonies. It is the multiple-queen colonies that pose a threat because they occur in very dense concentrations of about 750–5000 mounds per acre. They can enter through the cave entrance or crawl through small holes or cracks and attack the karst species where humans cannot observe. Slow moving adults, nymphs, and eggs are most vulnerable to fire ant predation. More than 50% of the caves observed had fire ants present. This is a large sign that the fire ant has taken over or will eventually take over the habitat. Even if the fire ant does not prey on the beetle it is likely to change the links that are critical in the food chain.|$|E
25|$|Monogyne workers kill foreign queens {{and aggressively}} defend their territory. However, not all {{behaviours}} are universal, primarily because worker behaviours {{depend on the}} ecological {{context in which they}} develop, and the manipulation of worker genotypes can elicit change in behaviours. Therefore, behaviours of native populations can differ from those of introduced populations. In a study to assess the aggressive behaviour of monogyne and polygyne <b>red</b> <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> workers by studying interaction in neutral arenas, and to develop a reliable ethogram for readily distinguishing between monogyne and polygyne colonies of red imported fire ants in the field, monogyne and polygyne workers discriminated between nestmates and foreigners as indicated by different behaviours ranging from tolerance to aggression. Monogyne ants always attacked foreign ants independently if they were from monogyne or polygyne colonies, whereas polygyne ants recognised, but did not attack, foreign polygyne ants, mainly by exhibiting postures similar to behaviours assumed after attacks by Pseudacteon phorids. Hostile versus warning behaviours were strongly dependent on the social structure of workers. Therefore, the behaviour toward foreign workers was a method of characterising monogyne and polygyne colonies. Most colonies in the southeastern and south-central US tend to be monogynous.|$|E
40|$|The Schaus swallowtail, Papilio aristodemus ponceanus, {{historically}} {{occurred in}} tropical hardwood hammocks from South Miami {{to the upper}} Florida Keys and is currently listed as federally endangered. Much of the remaining hardwood hammock habitat is fragmented by roads and human development that may alter the microhabitat within the hammocks and increase the probability of invasion by non-native predators and competitors. One non-indigenous species that has recently invaded the Florida Keys, and that may impact the Schaus swallowtail is the <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> (Solenopsis invicta Buren). We estimated abundance of <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> in Schaus swallowtail habitat on Key Largo, and the decrease in <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> resulting from the application of chemical ant baits. In addition, we conducted laboratory experiments to determine how vulnerable swallowtail life stages are to <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> predation. We found <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> at 50 % of transects in the hardwood hammock, up to 40 m from hammock edge. Chemical treatments were only partially effective in decreasing <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> abundance, and the effect was short-lived.

25|$|The red {{imported}} ant can be misidentified as the similar-looking S. richteri. The {{two species}} {{can be distinguished}} from each other through morphological examinations of the head, thorax, and postpetiole. In S. richteri, {{the sides of the}} head are broadly elliptical and the cordate shape seen in the <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> is absent. The region of the occipital lobes that are situated nearby the midline and occipital excision appear more crease-like in S. richteri than it does in the <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> The scapes of S. richteri are longer than they are in the <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> and the pronotum has strong angulate shoulders. Such character is almost absent in the <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> A shallow but sunken area is only known in the larger workers of S. richteri, which is located in the posterior region of the dorsum of the pronotum. This feature is completely absent in larger <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> workers. The <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant's</b> promesonotum is strongly convex, whereas this feature is weakly convex in S. richteri. Upon examination, the base of the propodeum is elongated and straight in S. richteri, while convex and shorter in the <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> It also has a wide postpetiole with either straight or diverging sides. The postpetiole in S. richteri is narrower with converging sides. In S. richteri, the transverse impression on the posterodorsal portion of the postpetiole is strong, but weak or absent in the <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> As well as that, S. richteri workers are 15% larger than <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> workers, are blackish-brown, and have a yellow stripe on the dorsal side of the gaster.|$|R
25|$|Interactions between <b>red</b> {{imported}} <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> {{and mammals}} have been rarely documented. However, deaths of live-trapped animals by <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> have been observed. Mortality rates in eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) young range from 33 to 75% because of <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> It {{is believed that}} <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> have a strong impact on many herpetofauna species; scientists have noted population declines in the Florida kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula floridana), and eggs and adults of the eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) and six-lined racerunner (Aspidoscelis sexlineata) {{are a source of}} food. Because of this, eastern fence lizards have adapted to have longer legs and new behaviours to escape the <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant.</b> Adult three-toed box turtles (Terrapene carolina triunguis), Houston toad (Anaxyrus houstonensis) juveniles, and American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) hatchlings are also attacked and killed by these ants. Despite this mostly-negative association, one study shows that <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> may be capable of impacting vector-borne disease transmissions by regulating tick populations and altering vector and host dynamics, thereby reducing transmission rates not only to animals, but to humans as well.|$|R

25|$|In the United States, the <b>red</b> {{imported}} <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> {{first arrived}} in the seaport of Mobile, Alabama, by cargo ship between 1933 and 1945.

They {{have managed to}} displace many native ants {{which has led to}} a number of ecological consequences. However, studies show that these ants are not always superior competitors that suppress native ants. Habitat disturbance prior to their arrival, and recruitment limitations, are more plausible reasons why native ants are suppressed. Between Tapinoma melanocephalum and Pheidole fervida, the <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> is stronger than both species but shows different levels of aggression. For example, they are less hostile towards T. melanocephalum in contrast to P. fervida.

The next year, he joined the faculty at National Chung Hsing University, and started teaching at National Taiwan University in 1985. Lee remained active at the Council of Agriculture, leading the department of farmers' services. In this position, {{he was responsible for}} introducing agritourism to the country. By 1992, Lee had been promoted to secretary-general of the Council of Agriculture. Five years later, a severe bout of foot-and-mouth disease hit hog farms across the country, and Lin was tabbed to head the newly established Animal and Plant Quarantine Bureau, a division of the Council of Agriculture. In 2000, Lee's department again worked to fight FMD, which had surfaced in a Changhua County dairy farm. In November 2002, Lin declared a ban on shipments of apples originating from Washington state in the United States, as the Animal and Plant Quarantine Bureau had detected the presence of codling moths in shipments delivered to the Port of Kaohsiung. A month after declaring the ban, Lee succeeded Fan Chen-tsung as agricultural minister. Soon after taking office, Lee established a task force dedicated to ecological conservation in response to a flock of black-faced spoonbills contracting botulism while at the Chiku bird sanctuary. In March 2003, seventeen passengers on the Alishan Forest Railway were killed after a train spun out of control. Because the Council of Agriculture was responsible for management of the railway, Lin offered an apology and NT$3 million in compensation {{to the families of the}} victims. He also attempted to resign his position, but the offer was not accepted. Later that year, Lee represented Taiwan at the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference. In 2004, Lee merged the COA's Central Taiwan Office and Food and Agriculture Department into one department, the Food and Agriculture Administration, after receiving approval from the Legislative Yuan to make the move. Tropical Storm Mindulle hit Taiwan in July and caused $5.75 billion in damage, after which Lee pledged to enforce regulations on farming in mountainous areas. In October, Japan accepted the first shipment of Taiwanese rice since 1971, an action Lee accredited to the government's response in acceding to the World Trade Organization in 2002. In November, Lee established the National <b>Red</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>Ant</b> Control Center to aid the eradication of red imported fire ants from Taiwan. Lin was featured in the documentary Let it Be, released that year. In 2005, the Council of Agriculture began a campaign to help people avoid consumption of pork products produced from sick animals. Duck eggs from central Taiwan were found to be contaminated by dioxins later that year, and the COA worked with the Environmental Protection Administration to test the air, soil, and quality of feed used by farmers. Su Chia-chyuan replaced Lee as Minister of Agriculture in January 2006. Since leaving office, Lee has criticized the COA for its slow reaction to a 2008 H5N2 outbreak, as well as accused the Forestry Bureau of arranging work for businesses through questionable build-operate-transfer deals.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the influence of}} both the proximity and extent of human developments and paved roads {{on the presence of}} the predatory, non-indigenous, <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> (Solenopsis invicta). This species was inadvertently introduced into the United States at the port of Mobile, Alabama, around 1930 and rapidly spread to many southeastern states, including Florida. More recently, S. invicta colonized the Florida Keys, an area with a high proportion of rare and endemic vertebrate and invertebrate species. We placed bait transects in transitional salt-marsh, pineland, and hardwood hammocks on 13 of the lower Florida Keys and compared habitat type, the shortest distance of the bait transect to a development or road, and area of development and roads 50, 70, 100, and 150 m around each bait transect for areas with and without <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> Red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> were detected on 21 of the 80 transects and were equally abundant in all habitat types. While all of the development and road variables differed significantly between bait transects with and without <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> transects that were closest to roads and that had the largest amount of development within a 150 m radii had the highest probability of presence of <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> Recovery efforts for endangered species in areas invaded by <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> should include analyses of the cumulative impacts of roads and developments in areas near protected lands...|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{more than}} 40 {{million people live}} in areas infested with <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> populations and 14 million people are stung by them annually. A quarter of all victims stung by <b>red</b> {{imported}} <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> are expected to develop sensitivity to the venom, and approximately 6,000 will suffer anaphylaxis. 51% of people who relocated themselves to infested areas report getting stung within three weeks after arrival. In a survey conducted in South Carolina, 33,000 people (or 94 per 10,000 population) received medical attention due to <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> and 660 people (1.9 per 10 000 population) were treated for anaphylaxis. In Texas, 79% of participants in a survey stated they had been stung by <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> while 20% had not. 61% of West Texans state they had been stung by the ants before, compared to 90% in central Texas, 89% in east Texas, 86% in the gulf coastal regions, 78% {{in the south and}} 72% in the north. In separate survey, 87% of individuals classed their reactions as mild, 12% as moderate and 1% as severe. In Australia, 64,000 homes are within <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> infested areas, and 140,000 consultations and 3,000 anaphylactic reaction cases are predicted every year by 2030 if government efforts to eradicate the ant fail. A survey conducted in China shows that one-third of participants in infested areas were victims of <b>red</b> imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> stings.|$|R
