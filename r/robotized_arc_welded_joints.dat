40|$|Abstract Fillet welds {{are by far}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> <b>joint</b> type in the fabrication industry with about 80 % of all <b>arc</b> <b>welded</b> <b>joints</b> worldwide. Alt-hough the joint is well established, there are many aspects to consider when pro-ducing an ideal weld. This paper reveals and connects several problematic issues related to the joint type and the difficulties to fabricate a weld with correct strength, cost, and quality. Excessive welding of fillet welds is common, resulting in increased fabrication cost. There could be several causes for this; the designers do not customize the weld demand for the different stress levels and the production adds even more to handle the variation in the process. Previous studies shows that the combination of these factors can result in 100 % extra weld metal, compared to what should be needed to fulfil the strength demands. Inspections are another contributor to excess welding. The capability of the weld size measurement method used by welders and inspectors is unsatisfactory. Measurement system analyses show that the scatter from the measurement system itself is in the same range as the scatter from the process. A critical summary of the current state-of-the-art is that fillet welds are hard to specify and fabricate with the right size, that the measuring method is incapable and the connection between size and strength is weak. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} scale effect in {{relatively}} thin <b>welded</b> <b>joints</b> subjected to fatigue loading. In scientific literature, the fatigue behaviour of <b>arc</b> <b>welded</b> <b>joints</b> is usually {{divided into two}} groups: thick and thin joints. A cut-off thickness, typically {{in the range of}} 13 mm to 22 mm, is introduced; under such cut-off value the design fatigue strength does not increase by decreasing thickness. Despite this common approach, in the present paper, by means of the implicit gradient method, the concept of cut-off thickness is revised and a single numerical procedure is proposed regardless of the thickness of the joint. In particular, classical non-load carrying and load carrying cruciform joints made of steel are considered in the numerical analysis. On the basis of many experimental comparisons, the implicit gradient approach seems able to capture the fatigue strength of <b>welded</b> <b>joints</b> also when only a few millimeters in thickness. Furthermore, in the case of load carrying cruciform joints, by scaling the weld geometry, it is discussed when the failure initiation site moves from the weld toe to the root and vice versa {{as a function of the}} thickness...|$|R

Since this DSA phenomenon, generally induces a large increase in the ultimate tensile strength and a ductility loss in the 100 - 300 °C temperature range, with a view to practical design, it is important to accurately characterize the beneficial effect of PWHT on DSA.

40|$|Welding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{reliable}} and efficient permanent metal joining processes in the industry. When two plates are joined by welding, a very complex thermal cycle is applied to the weldment. Thermal energy applied results in irreversible elastic-plastic deformation and consequently gives rise to the residual stresses in and around fusion zone and heat affected zone (HAZ). It is well established fact that structural integrity of components is substantially affected by the residual stresses when subjected to thermal and structural loads. Presence of residual stresses may be beneficial or harmful for the structural components depending on the nature and magnitude of residual stresses.

40|$|Purpose: ISO 5817 “Arc-welded joints in steel-Guidence {{on quality}} levels for imperfections” {{is a widely}} used {{international}} standard for evaluating of the <b>weld</b> imperfections in <b>arc</b> <b>welded</b> <b>joints.</b> In this study, {{in order to see}} the differences between the quality levels given in ISO 5817, the <b>welded</b> <b>joints</b> of B, C and D levels are subjected to the same load and the differences of maximum stresses at the joints are analysed by FEM. Design/methodology/approach: The <b>welded</b> <b>joints</b> with the quality levels of the weld imperfections given in ISO 5817 are modeled by a Solidworks FEM program, and they are subjected to static loading {{in order to determine the}} maximum stresses at the cross-sections of the joints. Findings: The stress values at the <b>welded</b> <b>joints</b> generally increases from the quality level of “B” to “D”. Exceptions of this behavior are the imperfections defined as “fillet welds having the throat thickness greater than nominal value”, “excessive penetration” and “excessive asymmetry fillet weld”. In these imperfections, the cross-sections carrying the force increases from “B” to “D”. Because of static force, a greater cross-section forms a smaller stress value. Thus, it must be given in the ISO 5817 whether the <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> is subjected to a static or dynamic load. Research limitations/implications: Three dimensional models can be investigated and the effect of 3 D weld imperfections on the behavior of a more realistic model can be calculated. Practical implications: The results show that some imperfections like “excessive penetration” and “excessive asymmetry filet weld” have less importance compared to the others. Originality/value: ISO 5817 is a worldwide used Standard for evaluating the weld imperfections. The quality levels of weld imperfections are compared with each other with FEM.
