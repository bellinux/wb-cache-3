Rita craves chocolate pudding and, <b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> last instance of this, realizes that she is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the writing}} {{received}} mixed reviews, {{the reception of}} the artwork was almost entirely positive. Higgins, <b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> heavy blacks and bold outlines of the original strip, found Critchlow's new style {{to be much more}} open and expressive. Maxwell also praised Critchlow's development as an artist, judging the comic to be beautifully drawn and coloured with a clear line style. Carter thought that the art was a little flat in places, but nevertheless praised it for being unique with a lot of character.|$|E

5|$|As Bryan spoke {{his final}} sentence, <b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> Crucifixion of Jesus, {{he placed his}} hands to his temples, fingers {{extended}}; with the final words, he extended his arms to his sides straight out to his body and held that pose for about five seconds as if offering himself as sacrifice for the cause, as the audience watched in dead silence. He then lowered them, descended from the podium, and began to head back to his seat as the stillness held.|$|E
5|$|C-SPAN {{celebrated its}} 10th anniversary in 1989 with a three-hour retrospective, {{featuring}} Lamb <b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> {{development of the}} network. The 15th anniversary was commemorated in an unconventional manner as the network facilitated a series of re-enactments of the seven historic Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858, which were televised from August to October 1994, and have been rebroadcast {{from time to time}} ever since. Five years later, the series , which won a Peabody Award, served as a year-long observation of C-SPAN's 20th anniversary.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{leading up to}} 1848, {{a small number of}} women began to push against {{restrictions}} imposed upon them by society. A few men aided in this effort. In 1831, Reverend Charles Grandison Finney began allowing women to pray aloud in gatherings of men and women. The Second Great Awakening was challenging women's traditional roles in religion. <b>Recalling</b> <b>the</b> era in 1870, Paulina Wright Davis set Finney's decision as the beginning of the American women's reform movement.|$|E

The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee also spent $250,000 to oppose <b>recall.</b> <b>The</b> NRA spent over $108,000 to support <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> efforts. In total, the Morse and Giron side spent approximately $3,000,000 opposing <b>the</b> <b>recall,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> supporters spent about $500,000.|$|R
5|$|The episode {{has been}} {{credited}} with helping to save at least two lives. During the scene in which Homer chokes on a donut, a poster explaining how the Heimlich maneuver works is {{on the wall behind}} him. In May 1992, Chris Bencze was able to save his brother's life by performing the Heimlich Maneuver on him, having seen it in the episode, and in December 2007, Aiden Bateman was able to save his friend Alex Hardy's life by <b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> same.|$|E
5|$|The {{symbolic}} use of Szczerbiec {{became a}} bone of contention again in 2009. After {{a monument to}} the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (Ukrayins'ka Povstans'ka Armiya) on the Chryszczata Mountain in southeastern Poland was vandalized, authorities of the Ukrainian city of Lviv demanded the removal of an image of Szczerbiec from the local Polish military cemetery. The Ukrainians, <b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> legendary use of the original sword in a Polish invasion of Kiev, argued it was a Polish nationalist, militaristic and anti-Ukrainian symbol.|$|E
5|$|The work {{is rich in}} {{symbolism}} and iconographic elements, to an extent far more pronounced than that in The Madonna Standing. An iris grows {{to the side of}} the aedicula, representing the Virgin's sorrow at the Passion, and on the other side a columbine, <b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> Sorrows of the Virgin. This symbolic use of flowers is again a van Eyckian motif. While they may appear incongruous with the architectural setting, this was probably the effect that van der Weyden was seeking.|$|E

5|$|Warelwast was {{probably}} sent as an envoy to Urban in 1096 to bribe the pope into <b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> papal legate Jarento, {{who had been}} sent to England to protest the king's conduct towards the church. In addition to his ambassadorial duties Warelwast acted as a royal justice under King William; the records of one case have survived.|$|E
5|$|Leonidas' {{actions have}} been the subject of much discussion. It is {{commonly}} stated that the Spartans were obeying the laws of Sparta by not retreating, but it seems it was actually the failure to retreat from Thermopylae that gave rise to the notion that Spartans never retreated. It is also possible that, <b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> words of the Oracle, Leonidas was committed to sacrifice his life in order to save Sparta. However, since the prophecy was specific to him, this seems a poor reason to commit 1,500 other men to a fight to the death.|$|E

5|$|On 8 March 1918, Maxwell {{commanded}} a scouting patrol that was operating {{to the east}} of Ploegsteert. Having obtained the required information, he ordered the patrol to withdraw. He and three of his men were covering the withdrawal of the main body when he noticed about thirty Germans nearby. <b>Recalling</b> <b>the</b> patrol, he led an attack against the party, which had sheltered in an old trench; the Germans quickly withdrew, leaving three dead and one wounded prisoner of war. Maxwell was awarded the Military Cross for his actions during this engagement, news of which was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 13 May 1918.|$|E
5|$|As {{promised by}} Fillmore, treaty commissioners arrived in La Pointe in 1854 to {{conclude}} a final treaty. <b>Recalling</b> <b>the</b> experiences of 1837 and 1842, the Ojibwa leaders sought {{to control the}} negotiations in 1854. Ambiguity in those treaties had been partially to blame for ensuing problems, so Buffalo insisted he would accept no interpreter other than Armstrong, whom he referred to as his adopted son. The Ojibwa insisted on a guarantee {{of the right to}} hunt, fish, and gather on all the ceded territory, and on the establishment on several reservations across western Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and northeastern Minnesota. In his mid-nineties and in failing health, Buffalo directed the negotiations but left most of the speaking to other chiefs. He entrusted Armstrong with taking care of the details in the written version.|$|E
5|$|Bawdsey, {{right on}} the eastern coast in a {{relatively}} secluded location, could not effectively be protected from air attack or even bombardment from boats offshore. The need to move the team to a more protected location on the opening of hostilities had been identified long before the war. During a visit to his alma mater at Dundee University, Watt approached the rector to ask about potentially basing the team there, on short notice. When the Germans invaded Poland and war was declared on 3 September 1939, the research teams packed up and arrived in Dundee to find the rector only dimly <b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> conversation and having nothing prepared for their arrival. Students and professors had since returned after the summer break, and only two small rooms were available for the entire group.|$|E

5|$|Biblical {{tradition}} {{holds that}} the Qedarites are named for Qedar, the second son of Ishmael, mentioned in the Bible's books of Genesis (25:13) and 1 Chronicles (1:29), where there are also frequent references to Qedar as a tribe. The earliest extrabiblical inscriptions discovered by archaeologists that mention the Qedarites are from the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Spanning the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, they list the names of Qedarite kings who revolted and were defeated in battle, {{as well as those}} who paid Assyrian monarchs tribute, including Zabibe, queen of the Arabs (šar-rat KUR.a-ri-bi). There are also Aramaic and Old South Arabian inscriptions <b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> Qedarites, who further appear briefly in the writings of Classical Greek, such as Herodotus, and Roman historians, such as Pliny the Elder, and Diodorus.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's {{coronation}} {{took place}} on 2 December 1804. Two separate crowns were brought for the ceremony: a golden laurel wreath <b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire and a replica of Charlemagne's crown. Napoleon entered the ceremony wearing the laurel wreath and kept it on his head throughout the proceedings. For the official coronation, he raised the Charlemagne crown over his own head in a symbolic gesture, but never placed it on top because he was already wearing the golden wreath. Instead he placed the crown on Josephine's head, the event commemorated in the officially sanctioned painting by Jacques-Louis David. Napoleon was also crowned King of Italy, with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, at the Cathedral of Milan on 26 May 1805. He created eighteen Marshals of the Empire from amongst his top generals to secure the allegiance of the army.|$|E
5|$|Radau summarises one {{passage from}} the book after another: the orang utans of Borneo wrestling open the jaws of a crocodile, or killing a python; the Timorese walking up tall trees, leaning back on ropes as they pull {{themselves}} upwards; the indescribable taste of a durian fruit, at once recalling custard, almond paste, roasted onions, sherry {{and a host of}} other things, that melts on the tongue, that one does not want to stop eating; more, the fruit has a repulsive odour, and the tree is dangerous, as the hard and heavy fruits can fall on your head. Radau follows Wallace up to the high plateaux of Java, where there are cypress forests covered in moss and lichen; finally at the summit the vegetation seems European, an island vegetation <b>recalling</b> <b>the</b> resemblance between the plants of the high Alps and of Lapland. And in Celebes, men run amok, generally killing a dozen people before meeting their own death.|$|E
