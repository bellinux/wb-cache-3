500|$|It Is the Law {{received}} generally positive reviews. George T.

Motion Picture Magazine called the film [...] "tense, suspensive, ... and new in its idea." [...] The Film Daily reviewer believed it would appeal to fans of the genre despite [...] "some hokum and implausible twists". Edwards's direction was praised, including his pacing of the story, although the reviewer for Variety felt the film was unnecessarily long. Hohl, in his dual <b>role</b> <b>performance,</b> was considered the strongest of the cast, despite some exaggerated expressions.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, {{boys are}} often homosocial, and gender <b>role</b> <b>performance</b> determines social rank. While gay boys {{receive the same}} enculturation, they are less compliant, Martin Levine summarizes: [...] "Harry (1982, 51–52), for example, found that 42 percent of his gay {{respondents}} were 'sissies' during childhood. Only 11 percent of his heterosexual samples were gender-role nonconformists. Bell, Weinberg, and Hammersmith (1981, 188) reported that half of their male homosexual subjects practiced gender-inappropriate behaviour in childhood. Among their heterosexual men, the rate of noncompliance was 25 percent. [...] Saghir and Robins (1973, 18) found that one-third of their gay man respondents conformed to gender role dictates. Only 3 percent of their heterosexual men deviated from the norm." [...] Thus effeminate boys, or sissies, are physically and verbally harassed (Saghir and Robins, 1973, 17–18; Bell, Weinberg, and Hammersmith 1981, 74–84), causing them to feel worthless and [...] "de-feminise".|$|E
