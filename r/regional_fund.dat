According to the Federal Government's investment plan for the transport infrastructure, €741.4million was allocated to the project in the period 2006–2010. The funding requirement that is in excess of the €3.641billion of federal funds as of 2011 is to be provided by Deutsche Bahn's own funds and third parties. The state of Thuringia is investing a total of €240million from the European <b>Regional</b> <b>Fund</b> in the two high-speed line projects (Nuremberg–Erfurt and Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle).|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate that the European <b>regional</b> development <b>funds</b> do not allow simultaneous achievement of goals of efficiency and equity when they are dedicated to financing transportation infrastructures. The paper first gives some insights on the history and the nature of <b>regional</b> development <b>funds.</b> Then we focus on the degree to which Ireland, Spain and Portugal (but not Greece), the main beneficiaries of regional policies, have been able to move to the European average (in terms of per capita income) since their membership in the EU, which also corresponds to the time when regional assistance was initiated in these countries. Empirical evidence also reveals that income disparities are increasing among regions within each of these countries and this raises the question as to whether the impact of <b>regional</b> <b>funds</b> is or is not rather favorable to this particular convergence pattern, given that one of the primary objectives of <b>regional</b> <b>funding</b> has been to ensure greater cohesion over the whole European territory. The answer comes mainly from the type of infrastructure <b>regional</b> <b>funds</b> finance. Since a significant part of <b>regional</b> <b>funds</b> is devoted to transportation issues, their impact on regional development has to be seen in the light of characteristics of the transport sector and the specific requirements in transport of each individual sector. The paper concludes that transportation infrastructures promote the country’s aggregate growth but cannot be seen as an efficient instrument to reduce interregional disparities in Europe...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{highlight}} the role of geographic spillover effects due to the <b>regional</b> <b>funds</b> on the convergence process of 145 European regions over 1989 - 1999. With the aim of enhancing cohesion, these funds are primarily allocated to the least developed regions. First the most important part of these funds is devoted to transportation infrastructures, which induce strong spillover effects. However they do not necessarily contribute to a more even regional development. Their impact has therefore to be seen in the light of growth rate variations of the targeted region and of the whole sample. Second, since the wealthiest regions have more ability to accompany <b>regional</b> <b>funds,</b> the role of additional <b>funds</b> in the <b>regional</b> development process is investigated as well. Using the formal tools of spatial econometrics, we first detect strong evidence of spatial autocorrelation, both on per capita GDP and <b>regional</b> <b>funds.</b> Moreover, two clusters, representative of the core-periphery framework, are persistent over the period and highlight spatial heterogeneity. These spatial effects are then included in the estimation of an appropriate conditional -convergence model, which allows us to control for spatial spillover effects among regions. Finally, with this model, we assess the impact of European <b>regional</b> <b>funds</b> on the <b>regional</b> convergence process using simulation experiments. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} factors that support a funding demand {{increase}} in regional economies under easing monetary conditions. The following results were empirically obtained {{on the basis of}} individual firms and the 47 regional data in the 2000 s in Japan. The first result is that funding demand regionally increases where the relative size of private capital stock is large. This result suggests that industrial agglomeration complements easing monetary policy to induce <b>regional</b> <b>funding</b> demand. The second result is that regional banking soundness in lending markets also contributes to an increase in the funding demand. This suggests that another possible requirement of the money suppliers must be fulfilled to induce the <b>regional</b> <b>funding</b> demand. ...|$|R
