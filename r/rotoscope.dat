5|$|Lola Visual Effects {{worked on}} 48 shots, {{including}} some animation to Bana and Nimoy. Bana required extensive {{damage to his}} teeth, which was significant enough to completely replace his mouth in some shots. Nimoy's mouth was reanimated in his first scene with Kirk following a rerecording session. The filmmakers had filmed Nimoy when he rerecorded his lines so they could <b>rotoscope</b> his mouth into the film, even recreating the lighting conditions, but they realized they had to digitally recreate his lips because of the bouncing light created by the camp fire.|$|E
5|$|For {{landings}} and take-offs, wire flying riggings were devised and used. On location, {{these were}} suspended from tower cranes, {{whereas in the}} studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings. Some of the wire-flying work was quite audacious considering computer-controlled rigs were not then available—the penultimate shot where Superman flies out of the prison yard for example. Although stuntmen were used, Reeve did {{much of the work}} himself, and was suspended as high as 50feet in the air. Counterweights and pulleys were typically used to achieve flying movement, rather than electronic or motorized devices. The thin wires used to suspend Reeve were typically removed from the film in post-production using <b>rotoscope</b> techniques, although this wasn't necessary in all shots (in certain lighting conditions or when Superman is very distant in the frame, the wires were more or less imperceptible).|$|E
5|$|For the live-action {{portion of}} the production, Bakshi and his cast and crew went to Spain, where the <b>rotoscope</b> models acted out their parts in costume. During {{the middle of a}} large shoot, union bosses called for a lunch break, and Bakshi {{secretly}} shot footage of actors in Orc costumes moving toward the craft service table, and used the footage in the film. Many of the actors who contributed voices to this production also acted out their parts for rotoscoped scenes. The actions of Bilbo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were performed by Billy Barty, while Sharon Baird served as the performance model for Frodo Baggins. Other performers used on the rotoscoping session included John A. Neris as Gandalf, Walt Robles as Aragorn, Felix Silla as Gollum, Jeri Lea Ray as Galadriel and Aesop Aquarian as Gimli. Although some cel animation was produced and shot for the film, very little of it appears in the final film. Most of the film's crowd and battle scenes use a different technique, in which live-action footage is solarized (per an interview with the film's cinematographer, Timothy Galfas, in the documentary Forging Through the Darkness: the Ralph Bakshi Vision for The Lord of the Rings) to produce a more three-dimensional look. In a few shots the two techniques are combined.|$|E
30|$|This left three {{stimulus}} sets – photo, <b>rotoscoped,</b> and cartoon faces. Whereas {{the comparison}} of cartoon with <b>rotoscoped</b> and photo stimulus sets would reveal the impact of featural complexity on face processing, {{the comparison of}} <b>rotoscoped</b> and photo images would demonstrate effects of contrast.|$|R
50|$|In early 2015, an anime film titled The Case of Hana & Alice ({{animated}} prequel to the 2004 live-action film, Hana and Alice) {{was entirely}} animated {{through the use}} of <b>rotoscoping,</b> but it was far better-received than The Flowers of Evil, with critics praising its <b>rotoscoping.</b> In 2015, Kowabon, a short-form horror anime series using <b>rotoscoping,</b> was aired on Japanese TV.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rotoscoping</b> {{has often}} {{been used as a}} tool for visual effects in live-action movies. By tracing an object, the moviemaker creates a {{silhouette}} (called a matte) {{that can be used to}} extract that object from a scene for use on a different background. While blue and green screen techniques have made the process of layering subjects in scenes easier, <b>rotoscoping</b> still plays a large role in the production of visual effects imagery. <b>Rotoscoping</b> in the digital domain is often aided by motion tracking and onion-skinning software. <b>Rotoscoping</b> is often used in the preparation of garbage mattes for other matte-pulling processes.|$|R
5|$|For {{the final}} {{destruction}} of the Genesis planet, footage from the Paramount set had to be carefully matched with ILM effects footage. ILM built scale miniatures cut into sections to portray parts of Genesis' upheaval (rock slides, fissures opening in the ground) that live-action scenes could not easily replicate. One of the largest miniatures, measuring , had trick trees and trapdoors that could be reset, propane jets for gusts of fire, and solenoid-triggered rockfalls. For scenes where Kirk and Kruge battle at a precipice over a pit of lava, the shot combined animated lava, clouds (really cotton daubs on black), lightning, and a matte painting. Overhead shots of the lava were created by lighting a piece of clear Plexiglass with colored gels and covering the plate with methacyl, vermiculite and charcoal; the mixture dripped off the surface and coated the crew underneath. ILM simulated Kruge's demise, a long plunge into the pool of lava, {{with the help of}} a stop-motion puppet. Lloyd fell a few feet onto a black mattress; during a lighting flash the actor was replaced by the puppet that fell the rest of the distance. Because the shot was filmed on black instead of the traditional bluescreen, the animators had to remove or <b>rotoscope</b> the black background around Lloyd one frame at a time. The transition between the footage of Lloyd and the puppet was hidden by a single-frame flash as a bolt of lightning struck Kruge. The scene of Kirk and Spock beaming away as the ground collapses was another created at ILM, as the level of destruction was simply not possible for the live action crew.|$|E
25|$|After {{principal}} photography was finished, {{the film}} was transferred to QuickTime for an 18-month animation process: interpolated rotoscoping. A Scanner Darkly was filmed digitally using the Panasonic AG-DVX100 and then animated with Rotoshop, a proprietary graphics editing program created by Bob Sabiston. Rotoshop uses an animation technique called interpolated <b>rotoscope,</b> which was previously used in Linklater's film Waking Life. Linklater discussed the ideas and inspiration behind his use of rotoscoping in Ashraf's documentary, linking it to his personal experiences of lucid dreaming. Rotoscoping in traditional cel animation originally involved tracing over film frame-by-frame. This is similar in some respects to the <b>rotoscope</b> style of filmmaker Ralph Bakshi. Rotoshop animation makes use of vector keyframes and interpolates the in-between frames automatically.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese comic or manga Aku no Hana, by Shūzō Oshimi, is {{inspired}} by Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal. The anime was aired in 2013 and drew attention due to its heavy use of <b>rotoscope</b> animation. The protagonist in both manga and the anime, Takao Kasuga, is a bookworm whose favorite book is Les fleurs du mal, translated in Japanese as Aku no Hana.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rotoscoping</b> {{has also}} been used to allow a special visual effect (such as a glow, for example) to be guided by the matte or <b>rotoscoped</b> line. One classic use of {{traditional}} <b>rotoscoping</b> was in the original three Star Wars movies, where {{it was used to}} create the glowing lightsaber effect, by creating a matte based on sticks held by the actors. To achieve this, effects technicians traced a line over each frame with the prop, then enlarged each line and added the glow.|$|R
5|$|Although he {{continued}} to use <b>rotoscoping</b> in American Pop, Hey Good Lookin', and Fire and Ice, Bakshi later regretted his use of <b>rotoscoping,</b> stating that he {{felt that it was}} a mistake to trace the source footage rather than using it as a guide.|$|R

25|$|A Scanner Darkly is a 2006 American {{animated}} science-fiction thriller film {{directed by}} Richard Linklater, {{based on the}} novel of the same name by Philip K. Dick. The film tells the story of identity and deception in a near-future dystopia constantly under intrusive high-tech police surveillance {{in the midst of a}} drug addiction epidemic. The film was shot digitally and then animated using interpolated <b>rotoscope,</b> an animation technique in which animators trace over the original footage frame by frame, for use in live-action and animated films, giving the finished result a distinctive animated look. It was distributed by Warner Independent Pictures.|$|E
500|$|Publicity for {{the film}} {{announced}} that Bakshi had created [...] "the first movie painting" [...] by utilizing [...] "an entirely new technique in filmmaking." [...] Much of the film used live-action footage which was then rotoscoped to produce an animated look. This saved production costs and gave the animated characters a more realistic look. In animation historian Jerry Beck's The Animated Movie Guide, reviewer Marea Boylan writes that [...] "up to that point, animated films had not depicted extensive battle scenes with hundreds of characters. By using the <b>rotoscope,</b> Bakshi could trace highly complex scenes from live-action footage and transform them into animation, thereby {{taking advantage of the}} complexity live-action film can capture without incurring the exorbitant costs of producing a live-action film." ...|$|E
500|$|Danny Elfman {{was worried}} the {{characterization}} of Oogie Boogie would be considered racist by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Elfman's predictions came true; however, director Henry Selick stated the character {{was inspired by the}} Betty Boop cartoon The Old Man of the Mountain. [...] "Cab Calloway would dance his inimitable jazz dance and sing 'Minnie the Moocher' or 'Old Man of the Mountain', and they would <b>rotoscope</b> him, trace him, turn him into a cartoon character, often transforming him into an animal, like a walrus," [...] Selick continued. [...] "I think {{those are some of the}} most inventive moments in cartoon history, in no way racist, even though he was sometimes a villain. We went with Ken Page, who is a black singer, and he had no problem with it".|$|E

500|$|In 2006, {{following}} her hiatus, Ryder appeared in Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly, a film based on Philip K. Dick's well-received science fiction {{novel of the}} same name. Ryder starred alongside Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr. and Woody Harrelson. Live action scenes were transformed with <b>rotoscope</b> software and the film was entirely animated. A Scanner Darkly was screened at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and the 2006 Seattle International Film Festival. Critics disagreed over the film's merits; Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times found the film [...] "engrossing" [...] and wrote that [...] "the brilliance of [...] is how it suggests, without bombast or fanfare, {{the ways in which}} the real world has come to resemble the dark world of comic books." [...] Matthew Turner of View London, believing the film to be [...] "engaging" [...] and [...] "beautifully animated," [...] praised the film for its [...] "superb performances" [...] and original, thought-provoking screenplay." [...] Ryder appeared in the comedy The Darwin Awards with Joseph Fiennes. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2006.|$|E

50|$|The {{film was}} shot entirely on {{location}} in New York City’s Chinatown using live actors and then animated in post-production via <b>rotoscoping,</b> the process of tracing over live-action footage to create an animation; in this case, a painterly, watercolor effect.

5000|$|<b>Rotoscoping</b> is {{a method}} of {{traditional}} animation invented by Max Fleischer in 1915, in which animation is [...] "traced" [...] over actual film footage of actors and scenery. Traditionally, the live action will be printed out frame by frame and registered. Another piece of paper is then placed over the live action printouts and the action is traced frame by frame using a lightbox. The end result still looks hand drawn but the motion will be remarkably lifelike. The films Waking Life and American Pop are full-length <b>rotoscoped</b> films. <b>Rotoscoped</b> animation also appears in the music videos for A-ha's song [...] "Take On Me" [...] and Kanye West's [...] "Heartless". In most cases, <b>rotoscoping</b> is mainly used to aid the animation of realistically rendered human beings, as in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Peter Pan, and Sleeping Beauty.|$|R
