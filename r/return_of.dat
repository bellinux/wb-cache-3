40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relation between}} the speed of price adjustment and stock ownership by foreign and local institutional investors using data from the Korean stock market. We show that <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> stocks with high foreign institutional ownership lead <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> stocks with low foreign institutional ownership, especially after foreign ownership restriction is lifted. Likewise, <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> stocks with high local institutional ownership lead <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> stocks with low local institutional ownership. These results support the idea that foreign institutional (local institutional) investors have faster access to or processing power of new information than local institutional (local individual) investors.

In addition, the excess returns on the aggregate market are negatively skewed when the prior <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> glamour stocks are high. Finally, the inclusion of term premium, default premium, aggregate dividend yield, and the consumption-to-wealth ratio (CAY) as control variables do not materially alter the predictive power of prior glamour stock returns. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{determinants}} <b>of</b> expected <b>returns</b> on the listed penny stocks from two perspectives. Traditionally financial economics literature {{has been devoted}} to study the macro and micro determinants <b>of</b> expected <b>returns</b> on stocks (Subrahmanyam, 2010). Very few research has been carried out on penny stocks (Liu, Rhee, & Zhang, 2011; Nofsinger & Verma, 2014). Our study is an effort to contribute more empirical evidence on penny stocks in the emerging market context. We see the <b>return</b> dynamics <b>of</b> penny stocks from corporate governance perspective. Issues such as shareholding patters are considered to be of much significance when it comes to understand the price movements. Using cross-sectional data on 167 penny stocks listed in the National Stock Exchange of India, we show that (i) <b>Returns</b> <b>of</b> portfolio of lower market-cap penny stocks are significantly different(higher) than that of higher market-cap penny stocks. (ii) <b>Returns</b> <b>of</b> portfolio lower P/E stocks are significantly different (higher) than that of higher P/E stocks. Similarly, <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> portfolio of lower P/B stocks are significantly different (higher) than that of higher P/B stocks, and <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> portfolio of lower priced penny stocks are significantly different(higher) than that of higher priced penny stocks. (iii) Trading volume differences due to alphabetism are insignificant. (iv) Differences in <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> portfolios based on beta and shareholding patterns are insignificant.

The financial investors {{do not have a}} documented analytical method to compare the financial <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> index ETFs and matched index funds. We have performed quantitative comparisons <b>of</b> the financial <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> index ETFs and matched index mutual funds with the use of nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis hypotheses tests, assuming that the financial <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> index ETFs and matched index mutual funds are independent. We have tested the null hypotheses that the medians of the distributions of the Sharpe ratios and the risk-adjusted buy and hold <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> the S&P 500 index, large cap index, mid cap index, small cap growth index, REIT index, and total bond market index ETFs are as the same as the medians of the distributions of the Sharpe ratios and the risk-adjusted buy and hold <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> the matched S&P 500 index, large cap index, mid cap index, small cap growth index, REIT index, and total bond market index mutual funds.
