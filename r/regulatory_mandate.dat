2500|$|The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act ( [...] , [...] et seq.) is a 1988 United States {{federal law}} that {{establishes}} the jurisdictional framework that governs Indian gaming. [...] There was no federal gaming structure before this act. The stated purposes of the act include providing a legislative basis for the operation/regulation of Indian gaming, protecting gaming {{as a means of}} generating revenue for the tribes, encouraging economic development of these tribes, and protecting the enterprises from negative influences (such as organized crime). The law established the National Indian Gaming Commission and gave it a <b>regulatory</b> <b>mandate.</b> The law also delegated new authority to the U.S. Department of the Interior and created new federal offenses, giving the U.S. Department of Justice authority to prosecute them.|$|E

40|$|Regulation has {{economic}} and political dimensions, both of which I endogenize in this hierarchical model in which a legislature chooses by majority rule the mandate of an agency that faithfully regulates a firm with private information about its costs. Sufficient conditions are given for an equilibrium to exist. If {{there is a strong}} electoral connection between the benefits delivered to constituents and their electoral support, the legislature will choose a <b>regulatory</b> <b>mandate</b> that favors consumer over producer interests and results in regulation that does not maximize expected total surplus. Political interest in delivering benefits to constituents through factor employment results in a <b>regulatory</b> <b>mandate</b> that yields greater expected total surplus. ...|$|E
50|$|Renewable {{portfolio}} standards (RPS) are <b>regulatory</b> <b>mandates</b> {{that support}} increased production of renewables. Standards set a minimum amount for annual production of renewable energy. In Michigan, the United States, the 2016 Clean, Renewable and Efficient Energy Act requires that electric providers increase their supply of renewables from 10 percent in 2015 to 15 percent in 2021, with an interim requirement of 12.5 percent in 2019 and 2020. In the United States, state-level RPS have driven {{the development of}} renewable energy. RPS-motivated development accounted for 60 percent of American new renewable development in 2012.|$|R
50|$|Companies doing {{business}} in the United States are frequently required under <b>regulatory</b> <b>mandates</b> like Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA and FERPA to make sure that access to sensitive information is 100% controlled. This creates a challenge for IT organizations, which may not have a desktop search standard, or lack strict central control over end users downloading tools from the Internet. Some consumer-oriented desktop search tools make it possible to generate indexes outside the corporate firewall and share those indexes with unauthorized users. In some cases, end users are able to index — but not preview — items they should not even know exist.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show that {{regulatory}} risk is due to the discretionary behaviour of regulatory agencies, caused by a too extensive <b>regulatory</b> <b>mandate</b> provided by the legislator. The normative point of reference and a behavioural model of regulatory agencies based on the positive theory of regulation are presented. Regulatory risk with regard to the future behaviour of regulatory agencies is modelled as the consequence of the ex ante uncertainty about the relative influence of interest groups in the regulatory process. The problem of regulatory risk is analysed separately in competitive network areas and in non-competitive network areas. For both cases a specific measure of regulatory risk is proposed. But measurement and compensation are different issues. The im-possibility of compensating for regulatory risk is demonstrated. Finally, the disaggregated <b>regulatory</b> <b>mandate</b> is presented as an institutional reform approach. [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on {{regulatory}} reforms towards rule-based regulation. The theory of monopolistic bottlenecks is contrasted with the concept of essential facilities and the so-called three-criteria test. It is important to differentiate between efficient private bargaining of access conditions among competitive networks and regulated third party access to monopolistic bottlenecks. Regulation of infrastructure access charges should be limited exclusively to price-capping. In order to avoid the problem of extensive discretionary behavior of regulatory agencies a disaggregated <b>regulatory</b> <b>mandate</b> should be implemented. [...] ...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} R&D competition and cooperative standards set-ting. The quality of each technology design evolves over time {{as a result of}} each firm’s R&D expenditure. We argue that standardization — at least early stan-dardization — leads to a free riding problem, and thus to a significant decrease in marginal incentives for R&D investment. For this reason, competing firms, absent a <b>regulatory</b> <b>mandate,</b> may choose incompatible standards. Avoiding a single standard sacrifices short-run network benefits in exchange for faster tech-nology improvement. We provide conditions such that a non-standardization equilibrium is socially optimal...|$|E

30|$|The rising {{awareness}} {{of technology and}} knowledge innovation {{as a key for}} sustainable economic growth may enable the “Triple Helix impetus” as labelled by Etzkowitz (2008), meaning that university, industry, and government realise the need to develop a reciprocal relationship. Although such a belief has just started to grow and it will take more time until it is deeply rooted in society, China is turning to gain a stronger normative basis for developing the Triple Helix. To strengthen the motivations of both URIs and enterprises to cooperate with each other, the Chinese government has also provided financial incentives and <b>regulatory</b> <b>mandates.</b> Both the normative and regulative drivers lead to the second and the third stages of Triple Helix evolution.|$|R
40|$|Audit is a {{mandatory}} component of contemporary IT environment due {{to increase in}} <b>regulatory</b> <b>mandates,</b> contractual obligations, and other compliance requirements. Virtualization has gained immense popularity due to its economic benefits and other characteristics such as scalability, availability and high performance.

40|$|Good {{intentions}} are {{no substitute for}} sound economic regulation. Using the ‘in-vestment ladder’ as the stick and access holidays as the carrot is hardly an ef-fective way to generate competition. On the contrary, this approach creates a regulatory spiral. What regulators plead for today is in effect an obligatory shar-ing regime for nearly all network elements. However, this splitting up of net-works into their elements by ad hoc regulatory interventions is destroying con-sumer welfare. Instead, rule-based regulation of network-specific market power should be implemented {{by means of a}} disaggregated <b>regulatory</b> <b>mandate,</b> limit-ing incentive regulation to essential facilities as a whole.

40|$|While {{regulatory}} governance can be theorized as a three-party game {{in which}} regulators use intermediaries to influence targets, I show how regulatory intermediaries can, through delegation and orchestration, engage their own “subintermediaries” to increase their capacity for fulfilling their <b>regulatory</b> <b>mandates</b> and their influence on regulators and targets. I elucidate how the International Criminal Court (ICC) —the key intermediary in the regulatory regime for international crimes—has used nongovernmental organizations’ (NGOs’) advocacy, expertise, and operational capacities to compensate for its limited capabilities. Through NGO intermediaries, the ICC has aimed to increase its ability to prosecute, punish, and thus regulate international crimes; amplify its influence on state regulators and potential perpetrators; and improve the regulation of international crimes overall...|$|R
