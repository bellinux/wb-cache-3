From an operational viewpoint, the cruise demonstrated the great submerged endurance and sustained high-speed transit {{capabilities of the}} first generation of nuclear-powered submarines. Moreover, during the voyage, the submarine collected <b>reams</b> <b>of</b> oceanographic data. At the cruise's conclusion, Triton received the Presidential Unit Citation and Captain Beach received the Legion of Merit from President Dwight D. Eisenhower.|$|E
5|$|Barley's {{relationship}} with Morley was short-lived. By 1600, Morley {{had turned to}} East as his assignee, authorising him to print under his name for three years. Two years later, Morley died, and his music patent fell into abeyance. Unable {{to rely on the}} protections and privileges of Morley's monopoly, Barley most likely came under increasing pressure from the Stationers' Company. His financial circumstances also deteriorated after he was the target of a successful lawsuit by a cook named George Goodale, who was seeking payment of a debt of 80 pounds. As a result of the suit, many of Barley's goods were seized, including various books and <b>reams</b> <b>of</b> paper. Barley greatly reduced his output from 1601 to 1605, publishing only six works.|$|E

5000|$|Paper {{weight is}} {{sometimes}} stated using the [...] "#" [...] symbol. For example, [...] "20#" [...] means [...] "20 pounds per basis <b>ream</b> <b>of</b> 500 sheets". When the density <b>of</b> a <b>ream</b> <b>of</b> paper {{is given in}} pounds, it is often accompanied by its [...] "M weight". The M weight is the weight (in pounds) of 1000 cut sheets. Paper suppliers will often charge by M weight, since it is always consistent within a specific paper size, and because it allows a simple weight calculation for shipping charges.|$|R

According to prosecutors, they agreed to make a plea agreement because Schillaci's victim (now aged 15) was unwilling to testify and wanted to maintain his anonymity. After Schillaci was apprehended, his computer, which had <b>reams</b> <b>of</b> child pornography on its hard drive, led the FBI into an expansive probe of seeking child victims in the United States. As {{a part of his}} plea bargain, Schillaci cooperated with federal authorities by offering to give a name of one person.

Flanged Hohmanns, dedicated reamers and broach handles adapt easier than standard instrumentation in the narrow surgical routes of minimally invasive approaches. In our clinical practice, we have experienced on lateral mini-approach and postero-lateral mini-approach. We use routinely flanged retractors which can be useful for better visualization of the acetabulum because with single instrument it is possible to retract soft tissues and femoral metaphysis.

500|$|The Tale of the Genji is {{recognized}} as an enduring classic. McCullough writes that Murasaki [...] "is both the quintessential representative of a unique society and a writer who speaks to universal human concerns with a timeless voice. Japan has not seen another such genius." [...] Keene writes that The Tale of Genji continues to captivate, because, in the story, her characters and their concerns are universal. In the 1920s, when Waley's translation was published, reviewers compared Genji to Austen, Proust, and Shakespeare. Mulhern says of Murasaki that she is similar to Shakespeare, who represented his Elizabethan England, in that she captured {{the essence of the}} Heian court and as a novelist [...] "succeeded perhaps even beyond her own expectations." [...] Like Shakespeare, her work {{has been the subject of}} <b>reams</b> <b>of</b> criticism and many books.|$|E

For example, a <b>ream</b> <b>of</b> 20 lb, 8.5 x 11 in paper weighs 5 pounds, {{because it has been}} cut from a larger sheet into four pieces. In the United States, printing paper is generally 20 lb, 24 lb, or 32 lb at most. Cover stock is generally 68 lb, and 110 lb or more is considered card stock.|$|R

[...] As a result, she frequently passed the time reading at the Pasadena Central Library and writing reams and <b>reams</b> <b>of</b> pages in her [...] "big pink notebook".
