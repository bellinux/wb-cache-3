40|$|Abstract Background Neuronal {{migration}} {{is a crucial}} process that allows neurons to reach their correct target location to allow the nervous system to function properly. AP- 2 α is a transcription factor essential for neural crest cell migration and its mutation results in apoptosis within this cell population, as demonstrated by genetic models. Results We down-modulated AP- 2 α expression in GN- 11 neurons by RNA interference and observe reduced neuron migration following the activation of a specific <b>genetic</b> <b>programme</b> including the Adhesion Related Kinase (Axl) gene. We prove that Axl is able to coordinate migration per se and by ChIP and promoter analysis we observe that its transcription is directly driven by AP- 2 α via the binding {{to one or more}} functional AP- 2 α binding sites present in its regulatory region. Analysis of migration in AP- 2 α null mouse embryo fibroblasts also reveals an essential role for AP- 2 α in cell movement via the activation of a distinct <b>genetic</b> <b>programme.</b> Conclusion We show that AP- 2 α plays an essential role in cell movement via the activation of cell-specific <b>genetic</b> <b>programmes.</b> Moreover, we demonstrate that the AP- 2 α regulated gene Axl is an essential player in GN- 11 neuron migration. </p...|$|R

The paper focuses on the regulation of genetic counselling in postnatal predictive genetic diagnostics on humans. Research addresses the following questions: In which way does the GTA <b>regulate</b> <b>genetic</b> diagnostics of humans, in particular with regards to genetic counselling? How did relevant actors in the early 1990 s negotiate and <b>regulate</b> <b>genetic</b> diagnostics? Which actors were relevant in this respect? Which political processes led to the GTA? After discussing data and sources used in the analysis, the paper presents the relevant regulations of the GTG and sketches the typical process of Austrian law development. Moreover different stages and processes in the development of the GTA are described (informal and formal consultation of the draft bill by privileged stakeholders, parliamentary enquete commission, governmental bill, parliamentary commission and sub-commission and plenum of the National Assembly). ...|$|R

40|$|The seed in {{angiosperms}} {{is produced}} through coordinated {{development of the}} embryo, endosperm and seed coat. In dicots, most of the seed mass is {{taken up by the}} embryo with nutritional reserves stored in the cotyledons. During embryogenesis, well-coordinated developmental and <b>genetic</b> <b>programmes</b> establish the embryonic body plan, and the associated complex metabolic pathways result in the production of diverse nutrients and deposition of important seed storage reserves. To gain insights into the <b>genetic</b> <b>programmes</b> that operate during embryo development in Brassica napus L.

We used the key stages from single-cell zygote to mature embryo to generate comprehensive EST and proteome data sets. Analysis of these data sets identified 20 183 genes and 2607 proteins that are differentially expressed across different stages of embryo development. B. napus genes share high degree of homology with Arabidopsis and display stage-specific and shared expression patterns associated with developmental and metabolic pathways. Together, this study has generated useful new molecular and genomic resources for embryo development in B. napus. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

His attempt to apply the theory of information to organisms was a project already abandoned in the United States.

40|$|Identification of CIITA <b>regulated</b> <b>genetic</b> module {{dedicated}} for {{antigen presentation}} KRAWCZYK, Michal, et al. The class II trans-activator CIITA is a transcriptional co-activator {{required for the}} expression of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes. Although the latter function is well established, the global target-gene specificity of CIITA had not been defined. We therefore generated a comprehensive list of its target genes by performing genome-wide scans employing four different approaches designed to identify promoters that are occupied by CIITA in two key antigen presenting cells, B cells and dendritic cells. Surprisingly, in addition to MHC genes, only nine new targets were identified and validated by extensive functional and expression analysis. Seven of these genes are known or likely to function in processes contributing to MHC-mediated antigen presentation. The remaining two are of unknown function. CIITA is thus uniquely dedicated for genes implicated in antigen presentation. The finding that CIITA regulates such a highly focused gene expression module sets it apart from all other transcription factors, for which large-scale binding-site mapping has indicated that they exert pleiotropic functions and regulate [ [...] . ] KRAWCZYK, Michal, et al.

40|$|During development, {{the nervous}} system (NS) is {{assembled}} and sculpted through a concerted series of neurodevelopmental events orchestrated by a complex <b>genetic</b> <b>programme.</b> While neural-specific gene expression plays a critical part in this process, in recent years, a number of immune-related signaling and regulatory components have {{also been shown to}} play key physiological roles in the developing and adult NS. While the involvement of individual immune-related signaling components in neural functions may reflect their ubiquitous character, it may also reflect a much wider, as yet undescribed, genetic network of immune–related molecules acting as an intrinsic component of the neural-specific regulatory machinery that ultimately shapes the NS. In order to gain insights into the scale and wider functional organization of immune-related genetic networks in the NS, we examined the large scale pattern of expression of these genes in the brain. Our results show a highly significant correlated expression and transcriptional clustering among immune-related genes in the developing and adult brain, and this correlation was the highest in the brain when compared to muscle, liver, kidney and endothelial cells. We experimentally tested the regulatory clustering of immune system (IS) genes by using microarray expression profiling in cultures of dissociated neurons stimulated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha, and found a highly significant enrichment of immune system-related genes among the resulting differentially expressed genes. Our findings strongly suggest a coherent recruitment of entire immune-related genetic regulatory modules by the neural-specific <b>genetic</b> <b>programme</b> that shapes the NS...|$|R
