50|$|The {{method of}} {{turbocharging}} and supercharging an engine {{is referred to}} as twincharging. The Delta S4 was the first such example of this technology. Contemporary turbochargers were inefficient, as they did not produce boost at low RPMs. This phenomenon, known as turbo lag, negatively affects driveability, an important aspect of a rally car. Superchargers do not suffer from lag as they are powered directly from the engine's crankshaft, rather than by the exhaust gases. However, because of this direct mechanical connection, the supercharger presents a significant parasitic load to the engine at higher RPMs. Lancia designed their twincharger system so the supercharger provides instantaneous boost in the lower RPM <b>range,</b> <b>switching</b> to the turbocharger for more efficient higher RPM engine operation.|$|E

The virus spreads between people by different routes, including through the air in droplets and aerosols, and by direct contact. By housing ferrets under different conditions, it is possible to mimic various routes of transmission. Here, we inoculated donor animals with a mixture of two viruses whose genomes differed by one or two reverse engineered synonymous mutations, and measured the transmission of the mixture to exposed sentinel animals. Transmission through the air imposed a tight bottleneck since most recipient animals became infected by only one virus. In contrast, a direct contact transmission chain propagated a mixture of viruses suggesting the dose transferred by this route was higher. From animals with a mixed infection of viruses that were resistant and sensitive to the antiviral drug oseltamivir, resistance was propagated through contact transmission but not by air. These data imply that transmission events with a looser bottleneck can propagate minority variants and may be an important route for influenza evolution...|$|E
40|$|In the IEEE 802. 15. 4 {{standard}} for {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs), the coordinator switching process is initiated based on the link quality indicator (LQI) value of beacon frames when the mobile sensor node is {{at the edge of}} its current coordinator coverage <b>range.</b> <b>Switching</b> based on a fixed LQI threshold value is not suitable for scenarios where the mobile sensor nodes move at high speeds and the interval between received beacon frames is large.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a new scheme that triggers the coordinator switching process based on an adaptive LQI threshold.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of wide band-gap (WBG) power devices including silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) {{has opened up}} new possibilities in various applications. Their distinctive advantages, compared to the silicon (Si) counterparts, can aid in achieving low cost, reliable and efficient power management of energy generation systems. In this thesis, the switching performance of different Si and SiC power semiconductors is evaluated and the measured power loss components is compared in a 1. 2 kW DC-DC converter. Thermal performance evaluation of power semiconductors is also compared using: (i) various switching frequencies up to 300 kHz, in steps of 25 kHz; (ii) case temperatures from 25 to 150 Â°C; and (iii) natural convection heatsinks with temperature increase rate of 0. 5 Â°C/W. The results demonstrate an opportunity to design power electronic (PE) systems with enhanced reliability and less effort required for thermal management. Also, an ultra-fast SiC MOSFET gate driver, which uses eGaN technology to realise MHz <b>range</b> <b>switching</b> capability is proposed. Using this gate driver, the operational performance of a SiC MOSFET for a 600 W non-isolated DC-DC boost converter at 2 MHz is experimentally analysed, and the maximum achievable switching frequency with this gate driver is determined. The effects of switching speeds on electromagnetic interference (EMI) generation from all-SiC and SiC-Si device combinations are investigated in a two-stage cascaded boost converter. A common mode (CM) EMI model for the converter is derived to identify noise sources. It is revealed that CM EMI emissions are independent of the device switching time when operated in the low-frequency range, while there is some dependence in the high-frequency range. Lastly, {{the performance of the}} SiC MOSFET device in a five-level flying capacitor (FC) converter is explored. Loss analysis is performed based on a calculation model, which verifies the correspondence between measurement and simulation results. In particular, the volume of the FC converter, and the passive components in the filter, are significantly reduced. This reduction is achieved by elevating the operating frequency for each controllable power switch based on self-balancing properties of the FC converter with phase shifted-PWM control. All theoretical considerations are supported by analysis, simulation and laboratory experimental results taken from low-power hardware prototypes...|$|E
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. An {{experimental study of}} the fast switching properties of the film-loop assemblies indicated that a line charge model for a rectangular magnetic film represents the external flux distribution of the film with good ([ [...] . ] 10 %) accuracy. The flux linkage of a deposited loop equals 100 % of the film flux. A 20 % decrease in film flux was measured {{at both ends of}} the film easy axis and a quadratic flux distribution is consistent with the experimental results. Eddy current and circulating loop current fields affect the nanosecond <b>range</b> <b>switching</b> of magnetic films. Eddy current fields increase rapidly with the fraction of magnetic film perimeter covered by the loop conductors. Capacitive loop current fields cause a small increase in film switching time. Resistive loop loading can slow film switching significantly. The bias and drive field properties of deposited loops can be predicted from the loop dimensions. The deposition of complete film assemblies was effected without opening the vacuum of the system. The film switching test equipment incorporated a new method for the integration of fast switching signals and had a response time of 0. 8 nsec. A theoretical study of the coupling loop circuitry indicated that the loop attenuation and the spatial distribution of loop induced voltage distort the film output signal. These effects are small, but not negligible, for a loop with conductor separation of 50, 000 A and conductor thicknesses of 4000 A, enclosing a 1 cm[superscript 2] film switching in 1 nsec. The use of integrated deposited circuitry containing magnetic films is feasible for fast computers. A set of logic elements suitable for a deposited configuration has reasonable fan-in and fan-out potentialities. Theoretical miniaturization limits for deposited film logic circuitry depend chiefly on the resistivity of the coupling loops. Operation of such circuitry at low temperature reduces the limit of film size to about 14 microns. Miniaturization alleviates the effect of loop currents and attenuation on film switching signals, leading to low power, short switching time circuitry...|$|E
