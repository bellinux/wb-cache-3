Bar's Office of Disciplinary Conduct. Their complaint applies against Conway, a lawyer in public office, on the grounds that under rule 8.4(c): [...] "It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation", because of Conway's pattern of misrepresentation as well as her misuse of words such as [...] "massacre" [...] at a time when she holds high public office. The letter of complaint makes a specific reference {{to the use of the}} phrase [...] "alternative facts" [...] as being involved in one of the cases of alleged misconduct, citing as a reference for its claim an opinion article by a New York Times Op-Ed columnist.|$|E
5000|$|The NAACP v. Button decision, which {{approved}} the NAACP's [...] "test case" [...] strategy, {{also led to}} the growth of public interest law firms with other goals, such as less restrictive housing of the mentally ill, and even contesting the No Child Left Behind Act. However, those later class action cases also raised possible ethical problems of lawyers placing ideological motivations above actual client interests. The American Bar Association later adopted Model <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Conduct</b> 6.1 (applicable to lawyers working without charging clients) to distinguish those solicitations from others that violate legal ethics guidelines, although Justice Thurgood Marshall criticized that approach as benefiting primarily white establishment attorneys who could afford to work without pay, rather than increasing diversity within the bar, as NAACP practices had. Thus, in [...] Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn.,436 U.S. 447 (1978), the Supreme Court distinguished inappropriate for-profit client solicitations from the protected political speech in Button and the ACLU attorney in In re Primus, whom it found South Carolina improperly prosecuted for offering legal services for free to a woman who was involuntarily sterilized.|$|E

Section I of this Comment identifies and describes instances of attorney behavior that result in gender and racial bias and explains the impact of such bias on attorneys, clients, and the judicial system. Section II explores similar anti-bias rules proposed or in place in other states.

40|$|In Standing Committee on Discipline of the United States District Court for the Central District of California v. Yagman, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals {{held that}} an {{attorney}} who publicly criticized a federal judge did not commit sanctionable conduct. In determining whether the attorney, Stephen Yagman, had violated a local <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>conduct</b> for lawyers, the court applied a 2 ̆ 2 reasonable attorney 2 ̆ 2 standard, rather than a subjective malice standard. The court held that Yagman 2 ̆ 7 s statements, {{in light of this}} higher standard, did not violate the rule 2 ̆ 7 s prohibition against impugning the integrity of the court.

40|$|This Essay {{demonstrates}} that the theory underlying ABA Model <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Conduct</b> 1. 13 (c), granting lawyers the option to reveal certain client confidences on a discretionary basis, doesn’t work. Despite some compelling reasons for permitting disclosure of clients’ “bad” behavior, economics dictate {{that it should be}} a rare case in which a lawyer will actually disclose. The Essay utilizes the facts of a recent case involving in-house certified public accountants who revealed to state tax authorities that their employer had not been compliant with state tax laws, and were fired from their jobs. In thinking about whether similarly situated attorneys could be fired or would violate their professional ethical duties if they engaged in the same acts, the Essay reviews and reflects upon the existing commentary on organizational/corporate lawyers’ duties of confidentiality and the Model Rules’ up-the-ladder reporting requirements. The conclusion: Even if the Rules permit disclosure in some circumstances, the real possibilities of being fired or tagged as a lawyer who can’t be trusted with a secret are simply too great for even well-intentioned lawyers. The rule, then, is unlikely to encourage lawyers to disclose. The argument is made through a brief Essay rather than a longer analytical piece for two reasons. First, there exists ample and excellent literature filled with good and comprehensive analyses of the rules. What is lacking is an examination of how theory plays out in the real world. Second, the Essay is meant to provoke thought both among scholars, who function primarily in the realm of theory, and practitioners, who reside in the world of practice...|$|E
40|$|In a {{criminal}} justice system where guilty pleas are the norm and trials the rare exception, {{the issue of how}} much discovery a defendant is entitled to before allocution has immense significance. This article examines the scope of a prosecutor’s obligation to disclose impeachment information before a guilty plea. This question has polarized the criminal bar and bedeviled the academic community since the Supreme Court’s controversial decision in United States v. Ruiz (2002). A critical feature of the debate has been the enduring schism between a prosecutor’s legal and ethical obligations – a gulf that the American Bar Association recently widened by issuing a controversial opinion interpreting Model <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Conduct</b> 3. 8 (d) to impose obligations on prosecutors well beyond the requirements of the due process clause. The author addresses the controversial subject of impeachment disclosures from both an institutional and a substantive perspective. A great deal of legal scholarship aims directly at the content of proposed law reform without considering the threshold and pivotal question of what institution is best situated to administer those duties imposed. The author argues that as a matter of institutional competence and legitimacy, the courts are far better equipped to enforce criminal discovery obligations through rules of procedure than bar disciplinary authorities are capable of doing through attorney conduct rules. With regard to the substantive issue - that is, how much impeachment evidence should be turned over by a prosecutor before a guilty plea - the author proposes a categorical approach to impeachment disclosures that will mediate the tension between the defendant’s interest in accurately assessing the strength and weaknesses of the government’s case, and the state’s interest in protecting the privacy and security of potential witnesses...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the strong}} {{tradition}} in the law of not advertising for legal services, the Model <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Conduct</b> {{as well as the}} Arkansas <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Conduct</b> recognize that the interest in expanding public information about legal services trump that tradition. However, {{that is not the case}} in many states where, in some cases, lawyers have been advised to avoid certain types of interactive websites or risk what has been dubbed a 2 ̆ 2 one-click ethics violation. 2 ̆ 2 This article seeks to explain how attorneys can use social networking sites without violating any <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>conduct.</b> Additionally, the article proposes a modification <b>of</b> the current <b>rule</b> structure so that attorneys no longer have to choose between avoiding emerging methods of communicating or risking a violation <b>of</b> the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Conduct.</b> The article begins with an overview of the usage of and terminology relating to the two most popular social networking sites, Facebook and Twitter. Next, the article provides an overview <b>of</b> the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Conduct</b> that Relate to lawyer communication. Then, the article categorizes various types of interactions on social networking sites under the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Conduct,</b> and subsequently addresses various issues that can arise in the context of the use of social media for client development. Finally, the article suggests some general principles that could be considered in revising the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Conduct</b> to consider social networking sites. The article concludes that rules relating to advertising should be reconsidered with the purpose <b>of</b> the <b>rules,</b> assisting the public in obtaining legal services, in mind. Ultimately, the author proposes that the rules should be revised to either target specifically the communications that are deceptive, or to more broadly ban deceptive or overbearing communications...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{addresses}} {{one crucial}} {{aspect of the}} ongoing debate about grand jury transparency. Assuming that well over half {{the states and the}} federal government continue to employ the grand jury to investigate felony offenses, and assuming that these proceedings continue to be shielded from public view, should witnesses themselves be allowed to discuss their testimony with the press or with each other? This larger question raises two narrow but very important subsidiary issues. First, does a prosecutor who conditions a written proffer or cooperation agreement with a grand jury witness on the witness’s promise not to inform other targets, subjects, or witnesses about what information he provided to the government violate Model <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Conduct</b> 3. 4 (f) by impeding another party’s access to information in litigation? Second, does a judge who issues a grant of judicial immunity under 18 U. S. C. § 6003 or its state analogue and includes an order prohibiting the grand jury witness from talking to any other potential witnesses or to the media about {{the subject matter of the}} government’s investigation exceed his or her authority under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6 (e) ? Both of these scenarios implicate not only the public interest in being informed about governmental affairs, but also the ability of putative targets of an investigation to work together to gather, preserve, and submit potentially exculpatory information that may help influence the grand jury not to indict, or to indict for a lesser offense. In this Article, I will argue that efforts by prosecutors and judges to impose extrastatutory secrecy obligations on grand jury witnesses undermine the independence of the grand jury, and thwart its proper screening function...|$|E
40|$|It is odd, {{considering}} how often lawyers engage in aggregate settlements, {{that no one}} seems able to explain what 2 ̆ 2 aggregate settlement 2 ̆ 2 means. It {{is one of the}} most important yet least defined terms in complex litigation. Lawyers and judges talk about aggregate settlements as though it were obvious what the term signifies and as though it describes a single thing. In fact, group settlements in multiparty litigation vary significantly. And they vary in ways that make it difficult to determine whether certain deals ought to be understood as collective settlements or simply as groups of individual settlements bundled together. This much is clear: large-scale multiparty litigation generally settles in clusters rather than one claim at a time. In this Article, I develop a typology of aggregate settlements. By defining collective settlements in terms of their essential attributes, I hope to offer a more precise way of understanding and describing settlements in multiparty litigation and a sounder approach to applying the special ethical duties that attend aggregate settlements. Part I explains why settlements often come in bunches, focusing on the business imperatives that impel both plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 counsel and defendants, for different reasons, to favor collective resolutions. Part II shows that despite the frequency of group settlements, and the extent to which the term 2 ̆ 2 aggregate settlement 2 ̆ 2 is invoked, the term is rarely defined with clarity and never defined with adequate attention to its significance in regulating lawyer conduct. Part III offers a definition of the term based on a typology along two axes: allocation and conditionality. By looking at the essential features of group settlements, it is pos- sible to identify those settlements that impose on client autonomy or create client-client or lawyer-client conflicts of interest and to distinguish the types of imposition and conflicts. Part IV uses the typology to delineate a sound application of the aggregate settlement rule, a <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>conduct</b> that prohibits aggregate settlements in the absence of disclosure and informed consent. Finally, although the typology primarily addresses multiparty settlements in non-class litigation, Part V explores how some of the same ideas might be applied to improve understanding of the structures of class action settlements...|$|E
40|$|Model <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Conduct</b> 5. 1 (a) {{requires}} individual {{partners to}} make 2 ̆ 2 reasonable efforts 2 ̆ 2 {{to ensure that}} their firm has measures in effect that give 2 ̆ 2 reasonable assurance 2 ̆ 2 that all lawyers in the firm conform to ethical rules. Similarly, Model Rule 5. 3 (a) imposes upon individual partners the obligation of making 2 ̆ 2 reasonable efforts 2 ̆ 2 to ensure that the firm has measures in place giving 2 ̆ 2 reasonable assurance 2 ̆ 2 that the conduct of non-lawyers affiliated with the firm is compatible with the partner 2 ̆ 7 s professional obligations. These rules were adopted to encourage firms to create firm cultures and institute prophylactic policies and procedures [...] an 2 ̆ 2 ethical infrastructure 2 ̆ 2 [...] that would prevent misconduct before it occurred. Although these Model Rules have been widely adopted, they are, as far as enforcement goes, asserted to be a disciplinary 2 ̆ 2 dead letter. 2 ̆ 2 A little over ten years ago, Professor Ted Schneyer argued: Given the evidentiary problems of pinning professional misconduct on one or more members of a lawyering team, the reluctance to scapegoat some lawyers for sins potentially shared by others in their firm, and especially the importance of a law firm 2 ̆ 7 s ethical infrastructure and the diffuse responsibility for creating and maintaining that infrastructure, a disciplinary regime that targets only individual lawyers in an era of large law firms is no longer sufficient. Sanctions against firms are needed as well. Although we are accustomed to entity liability in the civil and criminal law arenas, Professor Schneyer 2 ̆ 7 s suggestion that firms be sanctioned [...] with monetary fines yet [...] for the disciplinary transgressions of their agents was novel and provocative. If this suggestion was not sufficient to grab the attention of the bar, Professor Schneyer 2 ̆ 7 s proposed standard of liability certainly was. He argued that firm liability should be tested under the respondeat superior standard that is employed against corporate defendants in most civil and criminal cases. Under that standard, firms would be liable for the wrongdoing of their agents who act within the scope of their employment and with the intention to benefit, at least in part, the firm, even when the agent is acting contrary to express firm policy. Thus, not only would an enforceable obligation to create an ethical infrastructure extend to firms as well as to individual partners, but the Model Rules 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 2 reasonable efforts 2 ̆ 2 standard would be eliminated. Firms, then, could be held vicariously liable for the wrongdoing of their agents even if they had in effect measures that provided 2 ̆ 2 reasonable 2 ̆ 2 (though obviously not perfect) assurance of ethical compliance...|$|E

40|$|Limited scope {{attorneys}} {{specializing in}} alternative dispute resolution (2 ̆ 2 ADR 2 ̆ 2) procedures could help clients like these {{achieve their goals}} and resolve their disputes in a timely manner. If more attorneys would consider providing these types of limited services, additional clients (i. e. people considered 2 ̆ 2 nobody 2 ̆ 7 s clients 2 ̆ 2 now) could be served {{in the way that}} matters most to them. This Article suggests a new model for attorney representation based on the combined use of limited scope representation and ADR processes to give otherwise unrepresented parties greater access to justice. Although none of these three concepts (i. e., access to justice, unbundled services, and ADR) are new, tying them together in this manner has yet to be considered in the scholarly literature. In addition to providing new resources for clients, attorneys could expand their practices, gain additional clients, and increase their revenue, all while helping represent the otherwise unrepresentable. As discussed in more detail below, these ideas could also alleviate the court systems as well as provide additional avenues for law schools and legal aid providers to provide services. Limited scope representation is well within the bounds of the ethical practice of law. The Model Rules of Professional Conduct have long allowed attorneys and clients to limit the scope of the representation. Model <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Conduct</b> 1. 2 (c) provides: 2 ̆ 2 (c) A lawyer may limit the scope of the representation if the limitation is reasonable under the circumstances and the client gives informed consent. 2 ̆ 2 A concise definition of 2 ̆ 2 limited scope representation 2 ̆ 2 is hiring an attorney to perform a 2 ̆ 2 discrete task 2 ̆ 2 and nothing else. Recently, the ABA endorsed limited-scope representation, or 2 ̆ 2 unbundling, 2 ̆ 2 in a Resolution, encouraging more attorneys to engage in this practice. 2 ̆ 2 Prior to this Article, most clients, attorneys, and scholars considered those 2 ̆ 2 discrete tasks 2 ̆ 2 to be litigation tasks, such as document drafting and hearing appearances. This Article shows how that type of thinking is short-sighted (perhaps even misguided) and should be broadened to better serve clients and client interests. Part II of this Article considers the inefficiencies present in the area of pro se representations, and the benefits of working with counsel, even on a limited basis. Part III of this Article discusses just how the themes of ADR, limited scope representation, and access to justice can be woven together as a new way to practice law. Part IV presents concrete examples of the types of representation services that could be offered on a limited scope basis. Part V discusses the policy reasons supporting and challenging this proposal in the views of the many different stakeholders at issue, including potential clients, attorneys, courts, and pro bono service providers, including law college clinics. Finally, Part VI concludes by tying together the ideas of limited scope representation, alternative dispute resolution and access to justice. This Article suggests that courts, lawyers, and law schools begin to offer these services more regularly, ultimately creating additional consumer awareness on the part of potential clients. The ultimate goal is to provide more services to those who cannot otherwise afford them, to increase attorney revenue, and to reduce court congestion all at the same time...|$|E
40|$|As {{everything}} else in life has become more global, so has the practice of law. Lawyers commonly have clients and conduct work in states other than the ones in which they reside and are licensed. Transactional lawyers commonly work for clients in different states or put together deals that close in states other than the ones {{in which they are}} licensed. Litigators, too, often have clients in other states, participate in court proceedings in other states, and engage in both formal and informal discovery in other states. The work of the litigator poses even more questions if that litigator is engaged in alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) as opposed to traditional litigation. Questions involving ADR and the unauthorized practice of law abound because of some fundamental distinctions between ADR and traditional litigation. For example, parties to ADR procedures may purposefully choose to conduct their dispute-resolution procedure in a neutral location, while in traditional litigation the location of the suit must be in a location upon which jurisdiction and venue are established. 2 In the case of a neutral-site ADR procedure, questions may arise as to where exactly the lawyers are practicing and whether the principles surrounding the rules relating to the unauthorized practice of law (“UPL”) —such as familiarity with local rules and customs—have any application to the situation. Even assuming the ADR procedure is related to the foreign jurisdiction (i. e., {{at least one of the}} parties is located in the foreign jurisdiction or the proceeding involves a claim under the law of the foreign jurisdiction), questions arise as to whether or not a lawyer could even receive temporary admission in another jurisdiction if the ADR procedure is not connected to a trial or administrative proceeding. In other words, despite the fact that the practice of law has become a national—and international—practice, state law and ethical rules governing lawyers generally limits a lawyer’s practice to the states in which the lawyer is licensed. Although some strides have been made in the recognition of the global practice of law, the statutes and rules regarding the unauthorized practice of law, particularly as they relate to multijurisdictional practice, remain inconsistent. Because of the lingering inconsistencies, lawyers still need to be aware of whether their activities constitute the practice of law, where their activities are taking place, and what, if anything, the lawyers should do if they are practicing law in a jurisdiction in which they are not licensed. This article attempts to give an overview of the problem facing litigators in their increasingly global practice, as well as the steps that litigators can take to act in compliance with legal and ethical guidelines. Accordingly, this article is divided into two broad areas. First, this article will discuss what activities constitute the practice of law and which jurisdiction’s law should govern, focusing on whether ADR practices constitute the practice of law. Second, if the litigator is engaged in the practice of law, this article considers what actions the litigator should take in order to comply with the applicable ethical rules. In 2002, the ABA proposed Model <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>Conduct</b> 5. 5 in an attempt to answer many of these questions relating to the unauthorized practice of law, including the questions related to multijurisdictional ADR practice. The proposed Model Rule would largely exempt ADR practice from the realm of the unauthorized practice of law. Nearly five years later, however, the states have not uniformly adopted Model Rule 5. 5, particularly as that rule relates to ADR procedures. 8 Because Model Rule 5. 5 would answer many, if not all, of these questions, these authors recommend that the remaining states consider this rule and adopt the rule, or a similar rule, in order to create a more uniform national practice...|$|E
