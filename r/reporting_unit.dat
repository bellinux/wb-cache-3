40|$|Paralysis (AFP) is an {{important}} component of polio eradication campaign. In Beed district, this is being done since 1998 with the co-operation of national polio surveillance project of the World Health Organization (WHO). Aims and Objectives: To review various factors, which determine the quality of surveillance. They include timeliness of <b>reporting</b> <b>units,</b> taluka wise distribution, month wise distribution, monitoring of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis rate, percentage of notification within 10 days, percentage of stool samples sent for virological study within 14 days of onset of paralysis & reasons for delay in stool collection. Detection of non-polio enterovirus in stool cultures is an indicator of quality of the reverse cold chain. Materials & Method: Surveillance network consists of 2 very high priority, 4 high priority, 13 low priority <b>reporting</b> <b>units</b> & 25 informer <b>units.</b> <b>Reporting</b> <b>units</b> are expected to submit weekly reports. A total of 315 cases of AFP were investigated during last 10 years. Virological studies are conducted at Haffkines Institute, Mumbai. Results & Conclusion: Timeliness of <b>reporting</b> <b>units</b> varied from 77 to 99 %. Zero reporting blocks went down from 2 - 3 to 1. More cases of AFP were seen in months of July, august & September. Non polio AFP rate ranged from 1. 38 to 7. 35 %. Percentage of notification within 10 days of onset was between 72 to 94 %. Percentage of stool samples collected within 14 days of onset of paralysis varied from 73 to 86 %. A close vigilance on all these factors, at all levels of administration is essential to ensure that no case of polio is missed out...|$|R

2500|$|Verbal Alarms are {{the least}} common means of {{reporting}} fires or emergencies generally involves civilians [...] "verbally" [...] making such reports directly to firehouses or fire companies –or– when incidents are observed by fire units themselves when they are away from their quarters. However, [...] "verbal" [...] alarms may also be reported by chief officers, Department officials (e.g., commissioners, medical officers, chaplains, et al.) or civilian employees of the FDNY (e.g., communications electricians, mechanics and such – even the dispatchers themselves) who observe fires or emergencies {{in the course of}} the performance of their duties. If a fire company is available, in quarters, it will immediately respond to the incident after advising the dispatchers of the same via telephone, voice alarm or radio. If the unit is away from its firehouse (e.g., responding to or operating at another alarm, on inspection duty, etc.) at the time, the company will either stop at the new incident and operate, or the officer will request a separate assignment (as the <b>reporting</b> <b>unit</b> is unavailable to operate).

In this approach, we minimize any further parametrization, which is introduced by many other available segmentation algorithms, and aim to replicate the ETRF grid by imposing a size constraint and using the square’s centres as seeds for superpixel generation...|$|R
