5|$|Beginning on June 28, 2011, the PHP Group {{implemented}} a timeline {{for the release}} of new versions of PHP. Under this system, at least one release should occur every month. Once per year, a minor release should occur which may include new features. Every minor release should at least be supported for two years with security and bug fixes, followed by at least one year of only security fixes, for a total of a three-year <b>release</b> <b>process</b> for every minor release. No new features, unless small and self-contained, are to be introduced into a minor release during the three-year <b>release</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

Shortly after its unveiling on 31 October 2013, HTC confirmed an upcoming release of Android 4.4.2 for all HTC One models, beginning with the Google Play version, and for Sense-equipped models in January 2014. For 4.4, HTC introduced a web page that allows users to track the development and <b>release</b> <b>process</b> of Android upgrade for its products, and aimed to release the 4.4 upgrade for the HTC One within 90 days of the release of its source code.|$|E

40|$|Release of {{nanomaterials}} {{may occur}} during any {{stage of the}} life-cycle and can eventually lead to exposure to humans, the environment or products. Due to {{the large number of}} combinations of <b>release</b> <b>processes</b> and nanomaterials, <b>release</b> scenarios can currently only be tested on a case-by-case basis. This chapter presents five case studies on nanomaterial release under different conditions. While two of the case studies investigate the potential release under well-defined laboratory conditions in order to obtain a clearer picture on the <b>release</b> <b>processes,</b> the other three studies measure the potential release in real workplaces. By combining these two approaches, it is possible to gather more information on release of and exposure to nanomaterials to eventually group the different <b>release</b> <b>processes</b> and scenarios, which will significantly simplify the investigations. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

They show Inna at the beach and residing at a pool, with one reviewer comparing the imagery to American action drama series Baywatch. The singer also performed [...] "More than Friends" [...] on various occasions.

Julien Goncalves of Pure Charts noted the song's commercial appeal. The Times of India Gavin Rasquinha wrote, [...] "If you like house music with catchy beats and strong vocals, give {{this one a}} whirl." [...] Commercially, [...] "More than Friends" [...] reached number 20 in native Romania, number 52 in Italy and number 92 in France. The record spent 25 weeks on Spain's PROMUSICAE chart, debuting at number 30 in April 2013 and peaking at position seven in August 2013. It was also certified Gold by the same organisation for streaming four million copies as of November 2013.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{techniques to}} study electronic transport and localized state distributions in amorphous semiconductors from their photocurrent response to steady and impulse excitation. The response to impulse excitation contains information on distributions of trapping and release times for localized {{states in the}} mobility gap of the material; the problem is to determine a unique density of states (DOS) from such data. One technique is applicable to cases in which both trapping and <b>release</b> <b>processes</b> are significant. A second ‘post-transit’ analysis is restricted to situations where only carrier <b>release</b> <b>processes</b> are significant. In both cases we derive analytical DOS spectroscopies capable of fine energy resolution. We also report on studies of transport and DOS distributions, in thin films of several representative chalcogenides, including recent studies of surface defect states in CdSe nanocrystals in SiOx matrix. We also report on interpretation of steady state and transient measurements on thin film amorphous As 2 Se 3...|$|R
