5|$|This {{discovery}} was preceded nearly eight years earlier by {{a report that}} treatment of unactivated ketones with palladium acetate yielded the same products in low yields.

5|$|Aside {{from this}} {{immediate}} effect, the case represented a clear <b>recognition</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Australia Act 1986 finally and completely ended all legal {{ties between the}} United Kingdom and Australia, and that Australia has been a fully independent and sovereign nation {{in its own right}} since at least 3 March 1986, when the Act came into force. Some commentators have criticised the evolutionary approach adopted by the court, and the court's resultant failure to find a certain date on which Australia became independent, arguing that the distinction is more than merely symbolic and could have real consequences. However, even Justice Callinan, who questioned the evolutionary approach in this case, affirmed in a later case (Attorney-General Western Australia v Marquet) that the effect of the Australia Act in finally recognising independence could not be doubted.|$|E

5|$|During 1191 the {{citizens}} of the city of London managed to acquire from Coutances and Prince John the <b>recognition</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city was self-governing, something they had been attempting to secure for a number of years. This however, was not the grant of a complete charter of liberties, which did not occur until 1199. In February 1193 Coutances summoned a council to Oxford, to address problems of administration and defence after the recently received news of Richard's captivity in Germany. The council also took oaths of fealty to Richard. Prince John, however, hearing that Richard was in captivity, immediately went to France and swore homage to King Philip for Richard's lands, and then returned to England and raised a rebellion. Coutances proceeded to besiege Windsor Castle, which was held by Prince John's men. When John heard that Richard was going to be freed, he left England and went to France.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside {{the main body of}} the table, at the end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals. This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later <b>recognition</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which contained the modern carbon group (group 14), titanium group (group 4), cerium, and thorium, because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from {{the main body of the}} table and placed in a separate lanthanide series; thorium was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as titanium and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|Monotype's {{development}} of Ehrhardt took {{place under the}} influence of executive and historian of printing Stanley Morison, not long after their successful creation of Times New Roman. It began from a <b>recognition</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Janson designs were well-respected by fine printers of the Arts and Crafts period such as Daniel Berkeley Updike, who could print books from them using hand-set type cast from surviving original matrices owned by the Stempel company of Germany. Morison had discussed what he knew of their history with Updike in their extensive correspondence from the 1920s onwards. Modernised versions of the Janson designs for hot metal printing were being created by Linotype and Monotype's American branch at the same time. In addition, Morison was interested in the history of printing in Leipzig, a centre of the German book trade, and would later write an article on the topic.|$|E

5|$|Study of {{the decree}} was {{already under way}} when the first full {{translation}} of the Greek text appeared in 1803. It was 20 years, however, before the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts was announced by Jean-François Champollion in Paris in 1822; it took longer still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and literature confidently. Major advances in the decoding were <b>recognition</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stone offered three {{versions of the same}} text (1799); that the demotic text used phonetic characters to spell foreign names (1802); that the hieroglyphic text did so as well, and had pervasive similarities to the demotic (Thomas Young, 1814); and that, in addition to being used for foreign names, phonetic characters were also used to spell native Egyptian words (Champollion, 1822–1824).|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} King Alexander III in 1286, {{and then of}} his granddaughter and heir Margaret, Maid of Norway in 1290, left 14 rivals for succession. To prevent civil war the Scottish magnates asked Edward I of England to arbitrate, for which he {{extracted}} legal <b>recognition</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> realm of Scotland was held as a feudal dependency to the throne of England before choosing John Balliol, {{the man with the}} strongest claim, who became king in 1292. Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale, the next strongest claimant, accepted this outcome with reluctance. Over the next few years Edward I used the concessions he had gained to systematically undermine both the authority of King John and the independence of Scotland. In 1295 John, on the urgings of his chief councillors, entered into an alliance with France, known as the Auld Alliance. In 1296 Edward invaded Scotland, deposing King John. The following year William Wallace and Andrew de Moray raised forces to resist the occupation and under their joint leadership an English army was defeated at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. For a short time Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as guardian of the realm. Edward came north in person and defeated Wallace at the Battle of Falkirk. The English barons refuted the French-inspired papal claim to Scottish overlordship in the Barons' Letter, 1301, claiming it rather as long possessed by English kings. Wallace escaped but probably resigned as Guardian of Scotland. In 1305 he fell {{into the hands of the}} English, who executed him for treason despite the fact that he believed he owed no allegiance to England.|$|E

25|$|The present {{understanding}} {{of pain in}} babies {{is largely due to}} the <b>recognition</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fetal and newborn unmyelinated nerve fibres are capable of relaying information, albeit slower than would be the case with myelinated fibres. At birth a baby has developed the neural pathways for nociception and for experiencing pain, but the pain responses are an immature version of that of an adult. There are a number of differences in both nerve structure and in the quality and extent of nerve response which are considered to be pertinent to understanding neonatal pain.|$|E

Preliminary experiments are presented, demonstrating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> proposed framework, using fixed length sequences of cep-stral feature vectors for classification of individual phonemes, performs comparably to more traditional <b>recognition</b> ap-proaches <b>that</b> use <b>the</b> entire observation sequence.

25|$|In 1945, the United States began a demobilization of {{the massive}} {{military}} force that had been built up during World War II.

Strikes and even some rioting by military personnel at overseas bases in January 1946 pressured President Harry S. Truman to continue the process despite growing concern about the Soviet Union and an increasing <b>recognition</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States was not going to be able to retreat into the isolationism of the pre-war years.
