40|$|Urbanisation {{typically}} {{results in}} a reduction of hollow-bearing trees {{and an increase in}} the density of particularly species, potentially resulting in an increased level of competition as cavity-nesting species compete for a limited resource. To improve understanding of hollow usage between urban cavity-nesting species in Australia, particularly parrots, we investigated how the hollow-using assemblage, visitation rate, diversity and number of interactions varied between hollows within urban remnant forest and continuous forest. Motion-activated video cameras were installed, via <b>roped</b> <b>access</b> to the canopy, and hollow usage was monitored at 61 hollows over a two-year period. Tree hollows within urban remnants had a significantly different assemblage of visitors to those in continuous forest as well as a higher rate of visitation than hollows within continuous forest, with the rainbow lorikeet making significantly more visitations than any other taxa. Hollows within urban remnants were characterised by significantly higher usage rates and significantly more aggressive interactions than hollows within continuous forest, with parrots responsible for almost all interactions. Within urban remnants, high rates of hollow visitation and both interspecific and intraspecific interactions observed at tree hollows suggest the number of available optimal hollows may be limiting. Understanding the usage of urban remnant hollows by wildlife, as well as the role of parrots as a potential flagship for the conservation of tree-hollows, is vital to prevent a decrease in the diversity of urban fauna, particularly as other less competitive species risk being outcompeted by abundant native species...|$|R
5000|$|The {{butterfly}} loop, {{also known}} as lineman's loop, butterfly knot, alpine butterfly knot and lineman's rider, is a knot used to form a fixed loop {{in the middle of}} a rope. Tied in the bight, it can be made in a <b>rope</b> without <b>access</b> to either of the ends; this is a distinct advantage when working with long climbing ropes. The butterfly loop is an excellent mid-line rigging knot; it handles multi-directional loading well and has a symmetrical shape that makes it easy to inspect. [...] In a climbing context it is also useful for traverse lines, some anchors, shortening rope slings, and for isolating damaged sections of rope.|$|R
40|$|Sensitivity to {{fairness}} {{may influence}} whether individuals choose {{to engage in}} acts that are mutually beneficial, selfish, altruistic, or spiteful. In {{a series of three}} experiments, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) could pull a <b>rope</b> to <b>access</b> out-of-reach food while concomitantly pulling another piece of food further away. In the first study, they could make a choice that solely benefited themselves (selfishness), or both themselves and another chimpanzee (mutualism). In the next two experiments, they could choose between providing food solely for another chimpanzee (altruism), or for neither while preventing the other chimpanzee from receiving a benefit (spite). The main result across all studies was that chimpanzees made their choices based solely on personal gain, with no regard for the outcomes of a conspecific. These results raise questions about the origins of human cooperative behaviour...|$|R

5000|$|For small {{diameter}} pipes {{there may}} not be enough room for the tractor mechanism. Instead, a somewhat rigid [...] "fish" [...] is pushed through the pipe and attached to a <b>rope</b> at the <b>access</b> point near the truck. The fish is then pulled to place the rope along the pipe. The rope is then used to pull the inspection pig and cable through the pipe. Detaching the rope, the cable is then used to pull the pig backwards as the pipe is inspected on the monitor (this is the method shown in the illustrations below).|$|R
5000|$|The cowboy bowline (also called [...] "Dutch bowline"), French bowline, and Portuguese bowline are {{variations}} of the bowline, each of which makes one loop. (Names of knots are mostly traditional and may not reflect their origins.) A running bowline {{can be used to}} make a noose which draws tighter as tension is placed on the standing part of the rope. The Birmingham bowline has two loops; the working part is passed twice around the standing part (the [...] "rabbit" [...] makes two trips out of the hole and around the tree). Other two-loop bowline knots include the Spanish bowline and the bowline on the bight; these can be tied in the middle of a <b>rope</b> without <b>access</b> to the ends. A triple bowline is used to make three loops. A Cossack knot is a bowline where the running end goes around the loop-start rather than the main part and has a more symetric triangular shaped knot.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of how {{particles}} that are accelerated by solar flares can escape promptly into the heliosphere, on time scales of an hour or less. Impulsive solar energetic particles (SEP) bursts are generally observed in association with so-called eruptive flares consisting of a coronal mass ejection (CME) and a flare. These highly prompt SEPs are believed to be accelerated directly by the flare, rather than by the CME shock, although the precise mechanism by which the particles are accelerated remains controversial. Whatever their origin, within the magnetic geometry of the standard eruptive-flare model, the accelerated particles should remain trapped in the closed magnetic fields of the coronal flare loops and the ejected flux rope. In this case the particles would reach the Earth only after a delay of many hours to a few days, when the bulk ejecta arrive at Earth. We propose that the external magnetic reconnection intrinsic to the breakout model for CME initiation can naturally account for the prompt escape of flare-accelerated energetic particles onto open interplanetary magnetic flux tubes. We present detailed 2. 5 D MHD simulations of a breakout CME/flare event with a background isothermal solar wind. Our calculations demonstrate that if the event occurs sufficiently near a coronal-hole boundary, interchange reconnection between open and closed field can occur, which allows particles from deep inside the ejected flux <b>rope</b> to <b>access</b> solar wind field lines soon after eruption. We compare these results with the standard observations of impulsive SEPs and discuss the implications of the model for further observations and calculations...|$|R

50|$|<b>Rope</b> <b>access</b> {{is a form}} of work positioning, {{initially}} {{developed from}} techniques used in climbing and caving, which applies practical ropework to allow workers to access difficult-to-reach locations without the use of scaffolding, cradles or an aerial work platform. <b>Rope</b> <b>access</b> technicians descend, ascend, and traverse ropes for access and work while suspended by their harness. Sometimes a work seat may be used. The support of the rope is intended to eliminate the likelihood of a fall altogether, but a back-up fall arrest system is used in case of the unlikely failure of the primary means of support. This redundancy system is usually achieved by using two ropes - a working line and a safety line.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} or abundance of indicator {{species such as}} vascular and non-vascular epiphytes could prove valuable in measuring the loss of biological diversity in fragmented ecosystems of coastal British Columbia. Approaches to ecosystem-based forestry, including variable retention and its assessment via adaptive management, attempt to address the loss of biodiversity associated with forest fragmentation. I discuss the usefulness of epiphytes as indicators {{of the effects of}} forest harvesting. This pilot study consisted of examining the distribution and percent-cover of nonvascular epiphytes in a second-growth and an old-growth forest in the CWH biogeoclimatic zone of the south west coast of British Columbia. Determining epiphyte zonation will prove to be a powerful tool in measuring differences among tree species and study sites. This is most effectively done by measuring mean percent cover of epiphyte functional groups within each of the epiphyte zones. Monitoring of epiphytes can be done in a cost-effective and precise way by using the single <b>rope</b> technique to <b>access</b> trees. Limitations to effective monitoring exist due to lack of life-history information on many of the species.
