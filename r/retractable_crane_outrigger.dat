50|$|The {{class is}} based on a frigate-like design, but built with an {{internal}} multipurpose deck (flex deck) and a stern vehicle ramp. The ships can serve as command platforms for a staff of 75 persons (naval or joint staff) with a containerized command and control centre, transport and base of operations for a company-sized landing force of some 200 men with vehicles. Alternatively, the flex deck can be used for mine-laying operations with a capacity of some 300 mines, or be fitted out for mine-clearing operations and launch and recover mine detecting and clearing equipment via a <b>retractable</b> gantry <b>crane,</b> adjacent to the stern vehicle ramp, which also is used for launching and recovering the fast landing craft. Furthermore, the flex deck can support a containerized hospital or simply transport a number of ISO standard containers or some 55 vehicles, including up to seven MBTs. The ships can carry two LCPs (Storebro SB90E), two rigid hull inflatable boats and two EH101 helicopters.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{structural}} {{performance of a}} non- traditional pier. The Modular Hybrid Pier (MHP) being investigated here is a structure that consists of two floating, reinforced-concrete, modular sections post- tensioned together. The three main objectives were: confirm that the operations deck could sustain a typical <b>outrigger</b> <b>crane</b> load without damage; verify the capacity of a bollard used to moor ships to the MHP; and model {{the behavior of the}} structure subjected to earthquake excitations. During the deck test, the load was applied at a position perceived to be the most vulnerable. The operations deck behaved linearly up to the maximum applied load. The deck performed in a satisfactory manner without structural damage during the test. Vessels are berthed at the MHP with mooring lines that are wrapped around a steel bollard which is fixed to the pier deck. The bollard performed according to the design requirements in terms of the load capacity and there was no observable damage in the deck of the MHP. A multi-degree-of-freedom analytical model of the MHP was created {{to determine the effects of}} the dynamic loading of seismic events on the fenders and the structure as a whole. The model incorporates the load rate dependent nature of the fender material and change in axial force with deformation. Ten earthquakes were used to find the seismic response of the structur...|$|R
