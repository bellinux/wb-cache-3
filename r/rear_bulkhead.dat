5|$|On August 12, 1985, Japan Airlines Flight 123, a Boeing 747-146SR, {{suffered}} a rupture {{of the pressure}} bulkhead in its tail section, caused by undetected damage during a faulty repair to the <b>rear</b> <b>bulkhead</b> after a tailstrike seven years earlier. Pressurized air subsequently rushed out of the bulkhead and blew off the plane's vertical stabilizer, also severing all four of its hydraulic control systems. The pilots were {{able to keep the}} plane airborne for 32 minutes using differential engine power, but without any hydraulics or the stabilizing force of the vertical stabilizer, the plane eventually crashed in mountainous terrain. There were only 4 survivors among the 524 on board. This accident is the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history.|$|E

50|$|Examination {{from the}} aircraft's {{maintenance}} record showed that maintenance crew had conducted a radiographic {{examination of the}} <b>rear</b> pressure <b>bulkhead</b> of the aircraft prior to the accident. However, investigator questioned {{the effectiveness of the}} technique. The technique used to examine this particular area (the <b>rear</b> pressure <b>bulkhead)</b> of the Vanguard has been demonstrated to be ineffective as a sure means of detecting corrosion. This is because of the difficulty of interpreting the photographic plate details resulting from the complex structure. With the inspection technique then in use, investigators concluded that the corrosion on the aircraft was not detectable.|$|R
25|$|The M7A was an open-wheeled {{single-seater}} with a mid-mounted engine {{driving the}} rear wheels. The chassis was a bathtub-type (i.e. open-topped) monocoque made from 22-gauge aluminium alloy and 20-gauge magnesium alloy panels glued and riveted {{together and to}} three steel bulkheads. The monocoque terminated behind the driver's seat and the engine {{was used as a}} stressed part of the chassis, bolted directly to the rearmost bulkhead. The gearbox was then attached behind the engine, and the rear suspension – consisting of lateral top links, twin radius arms and reversed wishbones– attached to the gearbox and the <b>rear</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> The front suspension – upper and lower lateral links and radius arms – and the steering column were attached to the two bulkheads in front of the driver. Coilover springs and Koni dampers mounted outside of the body were employed front and rear.|$|E
25|$|On 2 June 2013, {{investigators}} from the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation of Afghanistan confirmed the load shift hypothesis {{as the starting}} point: three armoured vehicles and two mine-sweeping vehicles, totalling 80 tons of weight, had not been properly secured. At least one armoured vehicle had broken loose on takeoff and rolled backwards, slamming into the airplane's <b>rear</b> <b>bulkhead,</b> puncturing the bulkhead and knocking out the Cockpit Voice Recorder and Flight Data Recorder. This also crippled hydraulic systems 1 and 2 and damaged the horizontal stabilizer components - most notably the jackscrew, which rendered the airplane uncontrollable. Control of the aircraft was therefore lost, with the abnormal pitch-up rotation, stall, and crash to the ground ensuing. The damage to the tail controls and hydraulic systems {{made it impossible for}} the crew to regain control of the aircraft.|$|E

500|$|As the German fleet {{began to}} {{withdraw}} after nightfall, Lützow, steaming at 15knots, attempted to pass behind the German line {{to seek the}} safety of the disengaged side. By 22:13, the last German ship in the line lost sight of Lützow, which was unable {{to keep up with the}} fleet. Scheer hoped that in the foggy darkness, Lützow could evade detection and successfully return to a German port. By 21:30, the ship was settling deeper into the sea. Water began to wash onto the deck and into the forecastle above the main armored deck; this would prove to be a significant problem. At midnight, there was still hope that the severely wounded Lützow could make it back to harbor. The ship was capable of [...] up until around 00:45 when she began taking on more water. At times, the ship had to slow down to as little as [...] to reduce pressure on the <b>rear</b> <b>bulkhead</b> in the torpedo flat. Critically, the forward main pumps were no longer usable, as the control rods had jammed.|$|E

50|$|The first chassis and the jig {{to produce}} it were built together. Lawrence laid out a chassis with a central tunnel made of four square-section 18 gauge steel tubes with {{extensive}} cross-bracing. Two long steel boxes with triangular cross-sections were made of 16 gauge steel and attached to the chassis in the door sill area. These stiffened the chassis and were also {{to serve as the}} car's fuel tanks. 16 gauge aluminum formed the front and <b>rear</b> <b>bulkheads</b> and floors and was used {{on both sides of the}} central tunnel to stiffen the car further. Voids in the tunnel were filled with expanded polyurethane foam to add even more stiffness and deaden sound.|$|R
25|$|On 2 October 1971, British European Airways Flight 706 {{operated}} by Vickers Vanguard G-APEC crashed near Aarsele in Belgium. The cause was {{the failure of}} the <b>rear</b> pressure <b>bulkhead</b> and subsequent destruction of the tailplane. All eight crew and 55 passengers died.|$|R

500|$|The Ekaterina II-class {{ships were}} {{originally}} designed with a short, heavily armored, central citadel, {{but this was}} changed during construction to a full waterline belt.

The belt was [...] high, and tapered down to a thickness of six inches at the bottom edge for the 16-inch plates. The upper [...] of the belt {{was intended to be}} above the waterline, but the ships were overweight and much of the belt was submerged. For example, Ekaterina II only had [...] above the waterline. The central citadel was above the belt, [...] long and [...] high.

[...] Some have drawn comparisons to Japan Airlines Flight 123, which crashed into a mountain in 1985, seven years after the aircraft had suffered a tailstrike while landing. Flight 123 suffered catastrophic damage in mid-air while climbing to its cruising altitude. The crash of Flight 123 was caused by an incorrect repair of the aircraft's tail section following the tailstrike, which left the <b>rear</b> pressure <b>bulkhead</b> of the airliner vulnerable to metal fatigue and ultimately resulted in explosive decompression.

500|$|The Sovetsky Soyuz-class ships {{devoted a}} total weight of [...] to armor protection, a {{slightly}} greater weight {{than that of}} the larger Japanese Yamato class (...) [...] Their armor was intended to resist 406mm shells and 500kg bombs, specifically shells fired from forward bearings between 35° and 50° from the centerline. This led to the very unusual situation where the armor belt thickened toward the bow to compensate for the narrowing of the ship near the forward magazines, which had to be compensated for by thicker armor. The belt was [...] long and covered 57% of the total waterline length. It was inclined 5° to increase its resistance to flat-trajectory shells. Over the machinery spaces it was [...] thick and increased in steps until it was [...] thick over the forward magazines. It was [...] over the rear magazine. The belt armor was carried forward of the magazines at a thickness of [...] and terminated in a steeply sloped (30°) transverse [...] bulkhead that reduced to [...] at the lower deck where it was continued down to the inner bottom by a [...] bulkhead.

Behind the side armour was an inboard longitudinal splinter bulkhead that was [...] thick between the middle and lower decks. This decreased to [...] between the middle and upper decks. The bulkhead sloped away from the edge of the lower deck to the lower edge of the armour belt with a total thickness of 75mm. The slope was one 50mm plate of Krupp non-cemented armour (KNC) on a 25mm nickel-steel plate. The forward end of the armoured citadel was protected separately and the transverse bulkhead was therefore only 75mm thick.

40|$|Fuselage is {{a primary}} {{structural}} component used for accommodating passengers in transport aircrafts. Normally fuselage is a built-up structure with structural members along longitudinal and circumferential directions. The skin used for the structure is a thin member with orthogonal stiffening. The design of these structures is a challenging field as the designer has {{to come out with}} the minimum weight without any compromise on safety of the structure. The current paper deals with the stress analysis of the pressure <b>bulkhead</b> at the <b>rear</b> end in the fuselage structure. Fuselage experiences a small percentage of lift loads, but the dominating load on the fuselage is the Inertia load.
