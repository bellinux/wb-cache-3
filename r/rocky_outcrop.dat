5|$|Al Jalali Fort lies on a <b>rocky</b> <b>outcrop</b> on {{the east}} side of the Muscat harbor. It faces Fort Al-Mirani, which is built on another outcrop on the west side. Muscat was {{strongly}} defended against attack from the sea by these twin forts, by the Muttrah fort further to the west and by other fortifications on the rocky ridges surrounding the bay.|$|E
5|$|At {{the core}} of Craigmillar Castle is the 14th-century L-plan tower house, built on a <b>rocky</b> <b>outcrop.</b> Wrapped around this is the 15th-century {{courtyard}} wall, with ranges of buildings at the south-east, east, and west. Beyond the wall is a lower outer wall, enclosing a broad outer courtyard. This contained gardens and a chapel. Further gardens lay to the south, where {{the outline of a}} fish pond can be seen.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of Edinburgh lay the marshy Nor Loch, formed in the early 15th century in the {{depression}} where Princes Street Gardens are now laid out. This natural defence was augmented by the steep slope up to {{the northern edge of}} the Old Town. Edinburgh Castle, on its <b>rocky</b> <b>outcrop,</b> defended the western approach. Walls were therefore needed primarily on the south and east sides of the burgh.|$|E

5|$|Overlooking Old Grimsby harbour and the {{anchorage}} of St Helen's Pool, the blockhouse {{would have}} housed {{a battery of}} two or three artillery pieces, positioned on a square gun platform on top of a <b>rocky</b> <b>outcrop.</b> An earthwork bank and a stone wall were built to protect it from attack from the beach and the landward sides respectively. A small room to provide living quarters for the garrison was later constructed {{on the side of the}} gun platform.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia terminalis {{grows in}} a bushfire-prone habitat, where fire is {{essential}} for many species to regenerate. P.t.terminalis is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed, which lies dormant in the soil. Large numbers of Persoonia seedlings appear after fire. However, <b>rocky</b> <b>outcrop</b> habitat is vulnerable to fires occurring at too-frequent intervals of less than five years, which puts many species that regenerate by seed at risk of local extinction as plants are unable to mature to set seed before the next fire.|$|E
5|$|The main Animal Lifestyles exhibit {{consists}} of a troop of hamadryas baboons. Zoo visitors may observe the troop in a large glassed-in gallery which looks out into a <b>rocky</b> <b>outcrop.</b> Small caves in the outcrop lead to interior burrows where the animals may avoid inclement weather. The rear wall of the gallery illustrates common forms of baboon signalling and behavior, along with other social aspects of the animals. Ample seating allows visitors to observe the troop.|$|E

5|$|Today {{the ruins}} of Castell y Bere still stand on a <b>rocky</b> <b>outcrop,</b> with {{protective}} ditches cut into the stone on {{the south and east}} sides. The entrance to the castle lies on the west side, where the barbican, probably built by Edward I, contains two gatetowers, overlooking the stone steps approaching the inner gate. Through the barbican is the castle courtyard, containing a large well and the remains of several internal buildings of uncertain date.|$|E
5|$|Dirleton Castle {{stands on}} a <b>rocky</b> <b>outcrop,</b> {{at the heart of}} the rich {{agricultural}} lands of the barony of Dirleton, and guards the coastal approach to Edinburgh from England, via the port of North Berwick. The ruins comprise a 13th-century keep, and a 16th-century house which the Ruthvens built adjacent. Only the basement levels survive of the 14th- and 15th-century additions built by the Haliburtons, although these comprised a large hall and tower house along the east range. Other buildings within the courtyard have also been demolished. Surrounding the castle are gardens, which may have been first laid out in the 16th century, although the present planting is largely of the 20th century. The garden walls enclose a 16th-century doocot, or pigeon house.|$|E
5|$|In Judaism, the Western Wall is venerated as {{the sole}} remnant of the Holy Temple. It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, {{as it is the}} closest {{permitted}} accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the Even ha-shetiya or Foundation Stone, which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by Kareth. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the <b>rocky</b> <b>outcrop</b> in the Dome of the Rock is the Foundation Stone, some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain. This spot was the site of the Holy of Holies when the Temple stood.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} passed onwards through Kejache {{territory and}} reported that the Kejache towns were situated in easily defensible locations and were often fortified. One of these was built on a <b>rocky</b> <b>outcrop</b> near a lake and a river that fed into it. The town was fortified with a wooden palisade and {{was surrounded by a}} moat. Cortés reported that the town of Tiac was even larger and was fortified with walls, watchtowers and earthworks; the town itself was divided into three individually fortified districts. Tiac was said to have been at war with the unnamed smaller town. The Kejache claimed that their towns were fortified against the attacks of their aggressive Itza neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Ashot III {{established}} the Kingdom of Lori (Tashir-Dzoraget Kingdom) in Gugark for strategic reasons and enthroned Gurgen in 982. Gurgen {{along with his}} brother Smbat are depicted on the sculptures of the patrons in both Sanahin and Haghpat. When the Tashir-Dzoraget kingdom fell {{as a result of}} Seljuk raids the Kyurikids migrated to Tavush and Metsnaberd yet they maintained ties with their ancestral fortress and compound in Akhtala. The fortress was built on an elevated <b>rocky</b> <b>outcrop</b> surrounded by deep canyons from three sides forming a natural protection. The somewhat accessible parts between the cliffs are reinforced by towers and walls. The only entrance to the compound is on the northern side protected by bell-shaped towers and walls. The walls and towers of the fortress are built of bluish basalt and lime mortar. The Kyurikids gradually lost their influence under the Seljuk grasp {{by the end of the}} 12th century.|$|E
5|$|The Avon rises east of {{the town}} of Chipping Sodbury in South Gloucestershire, just north of the village of Acton Turville. Running a {{somewhat}} circular path, the river drains east and then south through Wiltshire. Its first main settlement is the village of Luckington, two miles (3km) inside the Wiltshire border, and then on to Sherston. At Malmesbury it joins up with its first major tributary, the Tetbury Avon, which rises just north of Tetbury in Gloucestershire. This tributary is known locally as the Ingleburn, which in Old English means 'English river'. Here, the two rivers almost meet but their path is blocked by a <b>rocky</b> <b>outcrop</b> of the Cotswolds, almost creating an island for the ancient hilltop town of Malmesbury to sit on. Upstream of this confluence the river is sometimes referred to as the 'River Avon (Sherston Branch)' to distinguish it from the Tetbury Branch.|$|E

5|$|Two of {{the five}} species are {{considered}} at risk. In 2003, {{a survey of the}} four colonies of the critically endangered Christmas Island frigatebirds counted 1200 breeding pairs. As frigatebirds normally breed every other year, the total adult population was estimated to lie between 1800 and 3600 pairs. Larger numbers formerly bred on the island, but the clearance of breeding habitat during World War II and dust pollution from phosphate mining have contributed to the decrease. The population of the vulnerable Ascension frigatebird has been estimated at around 12,500 individuals. The birds formerly bred on Ascension Island itself, but the colonies were exterminated by feral cats introduced in 1815. The birds continued to breed on a <b>rocky</b> <b>outcrop</b> just off the shore of the island. A program conducted between 2002 and 2004 eradicated the feral cats and a few birds have returned to nest on the island.|$|E
5|$|The 2/15th was {{subsequently}} withdrawn to Gaza, where it stayed {{into the new}} year, before moving to Syria, where it formed part of the Allied occupation force established {{there at the end}} of the Syria–Lebanon campaign. In July 1942, in the face of a heavy German onslaught that threatened to break through to Suez, the 9th Division was hurriedly moved back to North Africa. The 2/15th subsequently took part in the First and Second Battles of El Alamein during the remainder of the year. Throughout August, the 2/15th subsequently held a position in the north-east sector of the line from Hill 33 to the coast. On 1 September, the 2/15th participated in the 9th Division's diversionary attack south of Tel-el-Eisa, codenamed Operation Bulimba, which was planned as a response to German offensive actions further south during the lead-up to the final assault in late October and early November 1942. In heavy fighting near Point 23, a low <b>rocky</b> <b>outcrop,</b> the battalion lost about half of its fighting strength, sustaining 183 casualties, amidst heavy hand-to-hand fighting as the battalion came up against heavy resistance after penetrating a German minefield. Ogle's carrier struck a mine during the operation, and he was seriously wounded. The battalion's role in the September attack, including the efforts of Corporal Horton McLachlan, who received the Distinguished Conduct Medal, was later depicted in a painting by Ivor Hele. Among the casualties at El Alamein was the 2/15th's recently appointed replacement commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Keith Magno, who was mortally wounded by artillery fire after the battalion was heavily shelled while forming up during an attack around Trig 29– a valuable piece of high ground south-west of Tel-el-Eisa– on 28 October. Casualties over both periods the battalion fought around Alamein totaled 81 killed, 23 died of wounds, 276 wounded and seven captured.|$|E
