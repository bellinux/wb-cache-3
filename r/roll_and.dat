5|$|The second roll was presumed lost by the 1780s, but {{actually}} {{remained in the}} hands of the royal family. William IV gave it to Mary FitzClarance, one of his illegitimate children by the courtesan Dorothea Jordan, sometime in the early 19th century. In 1824, FitzClarance married Charles Robert Fox, a major-general and from 1832–35 an officer of the surveyor of the ordnance, the same position Anthony Anthony had three centuries before him. Fox was a bibliophile, and historian Charles Knighton has suggested he knew the value of the roll, but its location nevertheless remained unknown to scholars. In 1857 Frederic Madden, keeper of manuscripts at the British Museum, was shown the second <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> learned that Mary Fox wished to sell it. After negotiations it was sold for £15 to the British Museum and was numbered Additional MS 22047. It was kept in its original format as a <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> has been stored in the British Library's manuscript collection at St Pancras since 1999.|$|E

Brian Jones experimented {{with the use of}} non-traditional instruments such as the sitar and slide guitar in their early days.
