5|$|Jeremiah Fisher {{constructed}} two <b>row</b> <b>houses,</b> {{joined by}} a common wall and constructed of brick laid in a Flemish bond, near the city square in 1817. These houses lay on Second Street and face west onto Constitution Square. Fisher owned and rented these houses until 1850, but after he sold them they were used as tenements until at least the 1940s. The Wilderness Trace Art League and Boyle County Historical Society Museum occupied the <b>row</b> <b>houses,</b> before the park's purchase by the county. It now houses the Danville-Boyle County Chamber of Commerce, the Arts Commission of Danville-Boyle County, and the communications department of the Danville Boyle-County Economic Development Partnership.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the cityscape comprises abandoned and revitalized industrial mills, double- and triple-decker housing (though <b>row</b> <b>houses</b> are rare, found so commonly in other Northeast cities), {{a small number of}} high-rise buildings (predominantly for housing the elderly), and single family homes. Interstate 95 serves as a physical barrier between the city's commercial core and neighborhoods such as Federal Hill and the West End.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century, Neoclassical {{architectural}} elements {{began to appear in}} the federal style row homes, such as iconic columns in the porticoes and classic motifs over doorways and windows. Many Federal-style <b>row</b> <b>houses</b> were modernized by placing a Greek-style porch at the front. Greek and Roman elements were integrated into public buildings such as the old City Hall, the old Norfolk Academy, and the Customs House.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} were bought for US$4.7 million in 1988 by real estate investor Samuel A. Rappaport. Rappaport, {{who made a}} fortune by buying, improving, and then selling run-down properties, announced in 1989 {{that he planned to}} turn the building into his own personal headquarters and add a glass-enclosed ballroom on its top. Rappaport also planned to have an apartment in one of the York <b>Row</b> <b>houses.</b> However, like many other Rappaport-owned buildings, they ended up being left vacant and neglected, becoming a target for vandals and the homeless.|$|E

5|$|In the mid {{and late}} 1840s, {{immigrants}} from Ireland and Germany streamed into the city, swelling {{the population of}} Philadelphia and its suburbs. In Philadelphia, as the rich moved west of 7th Street, the poor moved into the upper class' former homes, which were converted into tenements and boarding houses. Many small <b>row</b> <b>houses</b> crowded alleyways and small streets, and these areas were filthy, filled with garbage {{and the smell of}} manure from animal pens. During the 1840s and 1850s, hundreds died each year in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts from diseases such as malaria, smallpox, tuberculosis, and cholera, related to poor sanitation and diseases brought by immigrants; the poor suffered the most fatalities. Small rowhouses and tenement housing were constructed south of South Street.|$|E
5|$|Buchanan rarely {{consulted}} Breckinridge {{when making}} patronage appointments, and meetings {{between the two}} were infrequent. When Breckinridge and Buchanan endorsed the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state instead of allowing the people to vote, they managed to alienate most Northern Democrats, including Douglas. This disagreement ended plans for Breckinridge, Douglas, and Minnesota's Henry Mower Rice to build {{a series of three}} elaborate, conjoined <b>row</b> <b>houses</b> in which to live during their time in Washington, D.C. In November 1857, after Breckinridge found alternative lodging in Washington, he sold a slave woman and her young infant which, according to historian James C. Klotter, probably ended his days as a slaveholder. When Breckinridge did not travel to Illinois to campaign for Douglas's re-election to the Senate and gave him only a lukewarm endorsement, relations between them worsened.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth season}} {{concentrates}} on the school system and the mayoral race. It takes {{a closer look at}} Marlo Stanfield's drug gang which has grown to control most of western Baltimore's trafficking and Dukie, Randy, Michael, and Namondfour boys from West Baltimoreas they enter the eighth grade. Prez has begun a new career as a mathematics teacher at the same school. The cold-blooded Marlo has come to dominate the streets of the west side, using murder and intimidation to make up for his weak-quality drugs and lack of business acumen. His enforcers Chris Partlow and Snoop conceal their numerous victims in abandoned and boarded-up <b>row</b> <b>houses</b> where the bodies will not be readily discovered. The disappearances of so many known criminals come to mystify both the major crimes unit investigating Marlo and the homicide unit assigned to solve the presumed murders. Marlo coerces Bodie into working under him.|$|E

5|$|Rappaport died in 1994, and in January 1995 {{developer}} P Associates {{announced its}} agreement {{to buy the}} properties from his estate. The developer also disclosed {{plans to build a}} luxury residential tower at the site. The plan called for dismantling part of Furness's additions to the PSFS headquarters, which would serve as the tower's lobby. The York <b>Row</b> <b>houses</b> would have been completely demolished. The plan was controversial as preservationists wanted the buildings to remain unchanged. P Associates met with representatives of the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia and in February 1995 advanced a new plan that would preserve most of the PSFS headquarters and the York Row facade. The new plan, which was approved by the Philadelphia Historical Commission, included renovating the PSFS headquarters and converting it into restaurant and office space. The York Row building interiors had been stripped of everything except for one fireplace mantle and could not be restored. P Associates would instead preserve the front facade of the houses, back to the roof ridge line.|$|E

Construction of this area was begun in 1871. The Helvetia, a distinctive apartment hotel, was built at 706-708 Huntington Avenue in 1884-1885; a Georgian revival apartment building known as The Esther was built at 683 Huntington/142-148 Smith Street in 1912.
