5|$|Despite {{representing}} a new vessel, the Enterprise-A {{was the same}} model {{that had been used}} since 1979. Poorly regarded by earlier effects artists because of its complicated wiring and bulk, the Enterprises hairline cracks were puttied and sanded down, and the internal circuitry was redone. The new model's <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> were matched to similar intensities, saving the effects artists time because the lights would look correct with only a single pass, instead of three passes required previously (for the sensor dome, <b>running</b> <b>lights,</b> and window lights). One unfortunate byproduct of the fixes was the loss of the model's distinctive pearlescent finish. The elaborate sheen was never visible on screen (lighting schemes prevented reflections while filming so the ship could be properly inserted into effects shots) and so when the model was repainted with conventional techniques the effect was lost. The Bird of Prey had been damaged from work in The Voyage Home, where the ship was supposed to fly around the sun. To suggest singes, the model had been painted with black-tinged rubber cement, with the expectation that this application would rub off. The cement instead sat on the model and baked itself to the model surface, and had to be scrubbed off.|$|E
5|$|Lipsett {{decided to}} tow New Mexico for {{scrapping}} at Newark, New Jersey. The proximity of Newark to rail lines {{made it an}} ideal location for dismantling the ship and hauling away the steel. In early November 1947 New Mexico departed Boston, towed by two tugs. On 12 November, while {{off the coast of}} New York, the tugs pulling the battleship encountered heavy weather and were forced to cut the tow lines. <b>Running</b> <b>lights</b> were kept on aboard New Mexico along with three crewmembers, but the tugs eventually lost sight of the battleship. New Mexico then drifted as a derelict until spotted by a Coast Guard plane the next day, 35 miles off the coast. The two tugs then secured tow lines and continued the journey to the scrapyard.|$|E

50|$|Depending on {{prevailing}} {{regulations and}} vehicle equipment, the daytime <b>running</b> <b>light</b> function may be implemented by functionally specific lamps, by operating the low beam headlamps or fog lamps at full or reduced intensity, by operating the high-beam headlamps at reduced intensity, or by steady-burning {{operation of the}} front turn signals. Compared to any mode of headlamp operation to create the daytime <b>running</b> <b>light,</b> functionally dedicated DRLs maximize the potential benefits in safety performance and minimize fuel consumption, glare, motorcycle masking, and other potential drawbacks.|$|R

5|$|Released in September 2009, the E Series 2 HSV GTS {{incorporated}} {{a more powerful}} motor and drivetrain than other HSV models. It retains the same GM LS3 6.2L V8 engine but {{while the rest of}} the HSV range still have 317kW or 425bhp, the GTS engine is rated at (325kW). Twin bonnet scoops have returned to this model from the styling of the Pontiac G8. Other changes include the availability of launch control on manual versions, a recalibrated version of the magnetic ride control suspension with stiffer springs for the HSV GTS, wider wheels and a new high-flow dual-mode muffler system that produces a throatier roar under heavy acceleration. The E-Series 2 stability control system also has a Competition setting which allows for more wheel slip for special track or motorsport applications. The cruise control brakes the car when it is travelling downhill to ensure its speed stays within one per cent of the set speed. This model has daytime <b>running</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Federal Highway Administration {{estimates}} that red <b>light</b> <b>running</b> causes more than 100, 000 crashes and 1, 000 fatalities annually {{and results in}} an estimated economic loss of over $ 14 billion {{per year in the}} United States. In Iowa alone, a statewide analysis of red <b>light</b> <b>running</b> crashes, using crash data from 2001 to 2006, indicates that an average of 1, 682 red <b>light</b> <b>running</b> crashes occur at signalized intersections every year. As a result, red <b>light</b> <b>running</b> poses a significant safety issue for communities. Communities rarely have the resources to place additional law enforcement in the field to combat the problem and they are increasingly using automated red <b>light</b> <b>running</b> camera-enforcement systems at signalized intersections. In Iowa, three communities currently use camera enforcement since 2004. These communities include Davenport, Council Bluffs, and Clive. As communities across the United States attempt to address red <b>light</b> <b>running,</b> a number of communities have implemented red <b>light</b> <b>running</b> camera enforcement programs. This report examines the red <b>light</b> <b>running</b> programs in Iowa and summarizes results of analyses {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} such cameras...|$|R

25|$|It {{would appear}} that the bow of Scorpion skidded upon impact with the globigerina ooze on the sea floor, digging a sizable trench.

Long missions were flown {{along the coast}} (about 30 NM offshore) of Vietnam, China, North Korea and the eastern Soviet Union, and were of a highly secret nature; the aircraft sometimes masqueraded as regular P2V Neptunes in radio communications, and often flew with false serial numbers (Bureau Numbers) painted under the tail.
