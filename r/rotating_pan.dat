40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{characteristics}} of powders of morphine HCl suitable for nasal administration to be employed for pain treatment as alternative to injection. Primary microparticles of morphine were prepared by spray drying of aqueous drug solutions using sugars or sugar derivatives as drying protectors and particle shapers. The spray drying procedure modified morphine crystallinity making the substance amorphous and affecting its stability in dependence on the excipient employed. A tendency of the spray-dried powders to turn to varying degrees of yellow was observed. Tumbling the powder in a <b>rotating</b> <b>pan</b> allowed the agglomeration of the primary microparticles. Agglomerates were also obtained by tumbling a mixture of morphine crystals and spray-dried microparticles of excipients, with advantages for {{the stability of the}} preparation. A nasal device quantitatively insufflated all the morphine agglomerates. The in vitro transport of morphine through rabbit nasal mucosa was faster using nasal powders than with the saturated solution of morphine. Lactose was the most effective excipient for agglomerate manufacturing and delivery of spray-dried morphine. The agglomerates of morphine crystals mixed with mannitol/lecithin microparticles showed superior stability. However, the drug permeation through rabbit mucosa was slower than with spray-dried morphine microparticle agglomerates. 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 95 : 2553 – 2561, 200...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{combination}} of analytical and statistical methods {{is used to}} improve a tablet coating process guided by quality by design (QbD) principles. A solid dosage form product was found to intermittently exhibit bad taste. A suspected cause was the variability in coating thickness {{which could lead to}} the subject tasting the active ingredient in some tablets. A number of samples were analyzed using a laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) -based analytical method, and {{it was found that the}} main variability component was the tablet-to-tablet variability within a lot. Hence, it was inferred that the coating process (performed in a perforated <b>rotating</b> <b>pan)</b> required optimization. A set of designed experiments along with response surface modeling and kriging method were used to arrive at an optimal set of operating conditions. Effects of the amount of coating imparted, spray rate, pan rotation speed, and spray temperature were characterized. The results were quantified in terms of the relative standard deviation of tablet-averaged LIBS score and a coating variability index which was the ratio of the standard deviation of the tablet-averaged LIBS score and the weight gain of the tablets. The data-driven models developed based on the designed experiments predicted that the minimum value of this index would be obtained for a 6 % weight gain for a pan operating at the highest speed at the maximum fill level while using the lowest spraying rate and temperature from the chosen parametric space. This systematic application of the QbD-based method resulted in an enhanced process understanding and reducing the coating variability by more than half.

50|$|The term sugar plum {{came into}} general usage in the 1600s. At that time, adding layers of sweet which give sugar plums and comfits their hard shell was done through {{a slow and}} {{labour-intensive}} process called panning. Until the mechanization of the process, it often took several days, and thus the sugar plum was largely a luxury product. In fact, in the 18th century the word plum became British slang for a large pile of money or a bribe. However, by the 1860s manufacturers were using steam heat and mechanized <b>rotating</b> <b>pans,</b> {{and it was then}} available for mass consumption.|$|R
40|$|The {{uniformity}} of the coating thickness distribution {{is an important}} quality metric {{in the manufacture of}} pharmaceutical tablets during the spray coating process. An investigation of the asymptotic limits of coating thickness variability of tablets of varying shape was carried out based on the cap-to-band coating thickness distributions. A theoretical analysis shows that the cap-to-band coating thickness ratio is expected to be equal to the cap-to-band area ratio projected onto the spray direction divided by the actual cap-to-band surface area ratio. When the cap-to-band projected area ratio is larger (or smaller) than the cap-to-band surface area ratio, the mean coating thickness on the cap is larger (or smaller) than that on the band. To verify this, the dynamics of tablets in a <b>rotating</b> <b>pan</b> was modelled using discrete element method (DEM) simulations, while an image analysis technique based on the output of DEM simulations was applied to model the spray coating process and analyse the cap-to-band coating thickness ratio. A ray-tracing sampling method was further used to obtain the cap-to-band sample ratio. It was also found that a smaller spray angle with respect to the horizontal direction can decrease and even invert the cap-to-band coating thickness ratio, leading to a larger coating thickness on the band than the cap. Nevertheless, an asymptotic value of cap-to-band relative standard deviation can be reached once the cap-to-band coating thickness ratio becomes stable during the coating process. This asymptotic limit is within the range predicted based on the cap-to-band projected area ratio and surface area ratio. UK EPSRC Research Grant EP/L 019787 / 1 and EP/L 019922 /...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel embedded system capable of estimating 3 D positions of surfaces viewed by a stereoscopic rig {{consisting of a}} pair of calibrated cameras. Novel theoretical and technical aspects of the system are tied to two aspects of the design that deviate from typical stereoscopic reconstruction systems: (1) incorporation of an 10 x zoom lens (Rainbow-H 10 x 8. 5) and (2) implementation of the system on an embedded system. The system components include a DSP running µClinux, an embedded version of the Linux operating system, and an FPGA. The DSP orchestrates data flow within the system and performs complex computational tasks and the FPGA provides an interface to the system devices which consist of a CMOS camera pair and a pair of servo motors which <b>rotate</b> (<b>pan)</b> each camera. Calibration of the camera pair is accomplished using a collection of stereo images that view a common chess board calibration pattern for a set of pre-defined zoom positions. Calibration settings for an arbitrary zoom setting are estimated by interpolation of the camera parameters. A low-computational cost method for dense stereo matching is used to compute depth disparities for the stereo image pairs. Surface reconstruction is accomplished by classical triangulation of the matched points from the depth disparities. This article includes our methods and results for the following problems: (1) automatic computation of the focus and exposure settings for the lens and camera sensor, (2) calibration of the system for various zoom settings and (3) stereo reconstruction results for several free form objects. 1...|$|R

40|$|Tablet coating is {{a common}} {{pharmaceutical}} technique of applying a thin polymer-based ﬁlm to a tablet or a granule containing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Solid dosage forms are coated {{for a number of}} reasons, the most important of which is controlling the release profiles. The amount of coating on the surface of a tablet is critical to the effectiveness of the oral dosage form. Tablets are usually coated in horizontal <b>rotating</b> <b>pans</b> with the coating solution sprayed onto the free surface of the tablet bed. The advantages of tablet coating are taste masking, odour masking, physical and chemical protection, protects the drug from the gastric environment etc. There are various techniques for tablet coating such as sugar coating, film coating, and enteric coating. Recent trends in pharmaceutical technologies are the development of coating methods which overcomes the various disadvantages associated with solvent based coatings. In these latest technologies coating materials are directly coated onto the surface of solid dosage forms without using any solvent. Various solventless coatings are available such as electrostatic dry coating, magnetically assisted impaction coating, compression coating, hot melt coating, powder coating, and supercritical fluid coating. Supercell Coating Technology is a revolutionary tablet coating that accurately deposits controlled amounts of coating materials on tablets even if they are extremely hygroscopic or friable. Magnetically assisted impaction coating, electrostatic dry coating in solventless coatings, aqueous film coating and Supercell coating technology are also available recent technique of coating. An ideal tablet should be free from any visual defect or functional defect. The advancements and innovations in tablet manufacture have not decreased the problems, often encountered in the production, instead have increased the problems, mainly because of the complexities of tablet presses; and/or the greater demands of quality.
