25|$|In {{the early}} 1820s, several {{proposals}} {{were made to}} build additional tramroads and reservoirs, but the plans were opposed by the Barnsley Canal and the Aire and Calder. Plans for an additional reservoir at Wentworth Castle, above the Worsbrough reservoir, were opposed in the House of Lords, unless the Company would release its exclusive rights to build tramways from the canal to local collieries, and the bill was withdrawn, rather than agree to a clause which would have broken their monopoly on the coal reserves near to the canal. A decision was taken instead to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of the Worsbrough reservoir by , thereby increasing the surface area to , and this was completed in 1826.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{inception}} of the J.League, the highest level of club football was the Japan Soccer League (JSL), which consisted of amateur clubs. Despite being well-attended during the boom of the late 1960s and early 1970s (when Japan's national team won the bronze Olympic medal at the 1968 games in Mexico), the JSL went into decline in the 1980s, in general line with the deteriorating situation worldwide. Fans were few, the grounds were not of the highest quality, and the Japanese national team was not {{on a par with the}} Asian powerhouses. To <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of play domestically, to attempt to garner more fans, and to strengthen the national team, the Japan Football Association (JFA) decided to form a professional league.|$|E
25|$|The UPMC Sport Performance Complex was {{designed}} by the architectural firm L. D. Astorino Associates, Ltd.

The complex was completed at a cost reported from $30 to $80 million and, as part of Pittsburgh’s urban river-front revitalization effort, {{is located on the}} former site of the Jones & Laughlin, and later LTV, steel mill in the SouthSide Works. The MRI room had to be encased in five layers of steel plate, plus a sixth layer of copper, in order to shield the MRI machines from the nearby CSX railroad tracks.

25|$|After the league's first decade, the TT Pro League {{has taken}} steps to internationalise the league {{in an effort to}} <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of its competition. One of the first moves in this regard was to align its {{calendar}} with those of major football leagues around the world. Prior to 2011, the Pro League operated on a spring-to-fall format which caused several conflicts with the FIFA calendar. Consequently, many of the league's top players abandoned their Pro League clubs during June and July to compete in international competitions, which made it difficult for the league to attract supporters for its matches. The schedule change has provided several players greater transfer opportunities to more prominent leagues. The second move was to expand club rosters from 25 to 35 players to provide clubs flexibility during the prolonged calendar featuring three rounds of league competition, five domestic cup competitions, CFU Club Championship, and the CONCACAF Champions League.|$|E
