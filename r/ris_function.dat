40|$|Recently we {{reported}} that the c-mos(rat) coding region is preceded by sequences (RIS) which repress accumulation of c-mos RNA in the cytoplasm. To investigate the effect of RIS on RNA transcription or processing a retroviral promoter was inserted at different positions relative to RIS. Cotransfection was used to establish cell lines with high copy number of the plasmids and to avoid any selection for c-mos expression or <b>RIS</b> <b>function.</b> Analysis of RNA in the cell lines indicated that RIS {{does not provide a}} poly(A) site and allowed characterization of the c-mos(rat) poly(A) site. Surprisingly, RIS contains sequences homologous to elements involved in eucaryotic RNA cleavage/polyadenylation. To determine an effect of RIS on transcription, RNA was elongated in vitro in nuclei isolated from the cell lines and used to analyze the number of RNA polymerase II molecules transcribing different regions of the plasmid. The analysis showed that RIS does not act as transcription termination region...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{will discuss}} four topics: "n&bull; HIS/RIS/PACS integration"n&bull; Medical image and data Standards"n&bull; IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) Pro-files"n&bull; ePR (electronic Patient Record) "nPACS is an imaging management system that requires pertinent data from other medical information systems for an effective operation. Among these systems are {{hospital information system}} (HIS), and radiology information system (RIS). A voice recognition (VR) system {{can also be used}} to generate a radiology report as a direct output of the RIS which can be considered as a component of <b>RIS.</b> Many <b>functions,</b> for examples, image routing, prefetching, automatic grouping, etc. in the PACS server and display workstations rely on data extracted from both HIS and RIS. This presentation first discusses the infrastructure and <b>functions</b> of HIS, <b>RIS,</b> VR and data which are important to PACS operation, and their interfaces. HIS and RIS follow HL- 7 (Health Level 7) data format and TCP/IP communication standards, PACS uses DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine) image format and communication standard. The success of PCAS, HIS, and RIS interface rely on the conformance to these standards of each information system during system operation. "nTo interface HIS and RIS with PACS, certain guidelines are necessary including:"n(1) Each system (HIS, RIS, PACS) remains unchanged in its configuration, data, and functions performed. "n(2) Each system's hardware and software are ex-tended to allow for communication among systems. "n(3) Only data are shared; original system functions remain local. For example, <b>RIS</b> <b>functions</b> should not be performed at PACS or HIS workstation, or images should not be viewed at RIS workstation. Keeping each system specific and autonomous would simplify the interface process, since a complete database updates is difficult to perform at a global level. "nBased on these guidelines, successfully interfacing HIS, RIS, and PACS should follow these steps:"n(1) Identify the subset data that would be shared by other systems. Set up access rights and authorization for each system. "n(2) Convert non standard subset textual data to HL 7. This step, composing of designing a high level presentation, solving data inconsistencies, and naming conventions, can be accomplished by using a common data model and data language for all systems, and by defining rules of correspondence between various data definitions among systems. "n(3) Define communication protocol of data transfer, i. e., TCP/IP or DICOM. "nIn general, medical imaging industry conforms to the aforementioned standards as well the IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) profiles for integration of HIS, RIS and PACS. IHE is an evolving set of well defined clinical workflows under various clinical operation environments including radiology, pathology, surgery, and oncology. IHE profiles allow healthcare providers integration capability in order to work efficiently in providing optimal patient care. Essences of IHE will be highlighted. "nElectronic medical record (eMR) or electronic pa-tient record (ePR) is the ultimate patient oriented information system in a healthcare enterprise. In an even broader sense, if the ePR includes health record of an individual, then it is called eHR (Electronic Health Record). Although the development of a universal ePR as a commercial product is still years away, its eventual impact to the healthcare delivery system should not be underestimated. Currently most ePR is Web-based and application oriented and geared its design to a certain clinical subspecialty, for examples, outpatient radiology service, spinal surgery, CAD (Computer-aided diagnosis) server, etc. ePR with images distribution is necessary for wider range in clinical usage, its infrastructure and functionalities will be discussed...|$|R
50|$|At around 8.58 am on 19 April 2007, {{a portion}} of the MRT track between Tampines and Pasir <b>Ris</b> was not <b>functioning</b> properly. Several public service {{announcements}} had been made saying that the train service will be disrupted for about five minutes. The SMRT staff had to evacuate Pasir Ris while fixing the problem. As a result, all eastbound trains had to terminate at Tampines and continue its westbound service. The affected commuters were told that they have three days to collect their refunds from the SMRT. Normal train service was then resumed at 9.28 am and the commuters were then allowed to enter the MRT station again.|$|R
40|$|Let X be a quasi-Banach RIS (QBRIS) on [0, 1]. Then the {{following}} inclusions are valid: L∞⊂X⊂Lp, where p=p(X) > 0. In classical Banach case p= 1 and for canonical injection operators I:L∞→X; I:X→L 1 it’s known conditions for such properties as strict singularity (SS), disjoint strict singularity (DSS), (p,q) -absolutely summing, etc. We prove some similar facts in quasi-Banach case. If X is a QBRIS on [0,∞], {{then it is}} γ-normed for some 0 0. On the contrary to the finite measure case, when I(L∞,X) ∈SS for any X =L∞, there are many examples of spaces on [0,∞) such that I ∈DSS(L 1 ∩L∞,X). Another deep difference is: on [0, 1] : I(X,L 1) ∈DSS for any BanachX =L 1; but on [0,∞) :I(X,Lp+L∞) ∈DSS forX such thatLr,∞⊂X for some r>p. 1. Definitions and basic notations Let us start with some definitions. We shall use the term operator to mean a bounded linear operator; subspaces are assumed infinite and closed. We shall consider rear-rangement invariant spaces (<b>RIS)</b> of <b>functions,</b> both Banach and quasi-Banach. A quasi-Banach RIS is a complete quasinormed vector space (X, ‖ · ‖) of measurable functions on (0, 1) or (0,∞) such that ‖κA ‖ = 1 if measA = 1, and if g is in X, then f is in X and ‖f ‖ ≤ ‖g ‖ if f is a measurable function satisfying f ∗ ≤ g∗, where h∗ denotes the decreasing rearrangement of the function |h | (cf. [1]). A quasinorm is a function which satisfies the axioms for a norm except that the triangle inequality is replaced by ‖x+ y ‖ ≤ K(‖x‖+ ‖y‖) with some K> 1...|$|R
40|$|Tesis Doctoral inédita leída en la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología Molecular. Fecha de lectura 23 - 01 - 2004 The protein p 53 {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{regulators}} in the maintenance of the genomic integrity in the cells. We have examined the role of p 53 in response to the demethylating agent 5 -aza- 2 '-deoxycytidine (Decitabine, currently under clinical trials for the treatment of some tumors) and its possible involvement in the events that follow the demethylation of the genome. We have found a different response upon treatment with 5 -aza-dC in primary embryonic mouse fibroblasts (MEFs) depending on the p 53 status. Cells deficient for p 53 undergo massive apoptosis after treatment with 5 -aza-dC, while WT cells are viable and arrest at G 2. The apoptosis is extremely selective since MEFs deficient in other genes involved in cell cycle regulation such as p 16 INK 4 a, pl 9 ARF, p 21 or E 2 F- 112 behave as WT. This different sensitivity to 5 -aza-dC is also maintained in cells neoplastically transfomed with oncogenic Ras and has been assessed in vivo in a tumorigenesis assay in nude mice. Our results support a model by which 5 -aza-dC mainly exerts its anti-tumoral activity through the induction of severe chromosomal damage that results in a mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis in the absence of p 53. We also provide data that shows that the chromosomal damage results from the citotoxicity of the drug, rather than the extensive demethylation. The hipersensibility seen in cells deficient for p 53 has also been proven for other chemotherapeutic treatments such as cisplatin, gamma irradiation, UV rays or adriamycin. The efficacy of chemotherapy is therefore strongly influenced by the genetic alterations characteristic of each particular tumor. Oncogenic Ras triggers an irreversible proliferation arrest reminiscent of replicative senescence that has acquired a great relevance in the field because it can be considered as a tumor suppression mechanism. Ris 1 (for Ras-induced Senescence 1) is a novel gene recently identified that is specifically upregulated in Ras-senescent human fibroblast. Interestingly, Ris 1 is located in a locus previously defined by other investigators for its tumor-suppressor activity. In this work we have characterized <b>Ris</b> 1 <b>function</b> in mice. We have shown that Ris 1 is expressed in adult mice, mainly in brain. Ris 1 is also expressed during embryo development and upon differentiation with retinoic acid, showing an important participation in the differentiation processes. Taking into account that differentiation can be considered as a potential tumor suppression mechanism, we have analyzed in detail the role of Ris 1 using ES cells. We have generated ES cells with a homozygous deletion of Ris 1 and we have been able to show that the deficiency of Ris 1 reduces the teratogenic potential using a teratoma formation assay in nude mice. We have evidence that the mechanism underlying this effect is based in an increased differentiation potential. Also, ES Ris 1 -/- are more resistant to the apoptosis induced by staurosporine, but not other cellular stresses such as DNA damage or serum deprivation. For the in vivo <b>function</b> of <b>Ris</b> 1 we have followed a lost of function approach, based on genetically modified mice. We have generated a knock-out mouse for the protein and analyzed its phenotype. The animals deficient for Ris 1 are viable, fertile, follow a Mendelian segregation and we have not found any evidence of a tumor-prone phenotype after 5 months. We have also generated MEFs Ris 1 -/- by tetraploid complementation. This has been achieved by aggregation of tetraploid embryos with ES Ris 1 -/- cells. The MEFs Ris 1 -/- do not show any alterations in proliferation, transformation and although they are arrested by oncogenic Ras, we have shown data indicating that the response is not properly executed at the molecular level. There is a significant reduction in the levels of the protein ARF, one of the main transducers of the anti-oncogenic response. We think that this result is encouraging and lights a putative role of Ris 1 in the mechanisms that govern Ras induced senescence...|$|R
