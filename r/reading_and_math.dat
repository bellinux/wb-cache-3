40|$|In {{recent years}} {{behavioral}} genetic studies have provided conclusive evidence that <b>reading</b> disability <b>and</b> related learning disorders, such as mathematics disability, are due {{at least in}} part to heritable factors (DeFries et al. 1987; Alarcon et al. 1997). Although the observed relationship between performance in these areas also may be due substantially to genetic influences (Light and DeFries 1995; Thompson et al. 1991), relatively few studies have examined the genetic and environmental etiology of this covariation in a multivariate framework. In the present study data from 196 identical (monozygotic; MZ) and 155 samesex fraternal (dizygotic; DZ) twin pairs in which at least one member of each pair evidenced reading problems in school (reading disabled) were subjected to a multivariate behavioral genetic analysis. Structural equation models were fitted to twin data for verbal IQ (VIQ), phonological decoding ability (PHON), <b>reading</b> performance (<b>READ),</b> <b>and</b> mathematics performance (<b>MATH)</b> to assess the extent to which VIQ and PHON mediate the observed covariation between <b>READ</b> <b>and</b> <b>MATH.</b> Results suggest that VIQ and PHON account for most of the covariation between <b>READ</b> <b>and</b> <b>MATH.</b> Moreover, approximately 82 % of the observed correlation between <b>READ</b> <b>and</b> <b>MATH</b> was due to genetic factors that also influence VIQ and PHON. When data from 132 MZ and 91 same-sex DZ control twin pairs in which neither twin had a history of reading problems were subjected to the same analyses, the covariation between <b>READ</b> <b>and</b> <b>MATH</b> was found to be due to both genetic and shared environmental influences. Thus genetic factors that influence VIQ and PHON also contribute to the observed covariation between <b>READ</b> <b>and</b> <b>MATH</b> in both a reading-disabled and a control twin sample...|$|R

40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed Dec. 9, 2011) Committee members: Erika Daniels (chair), Jenny MorganThesis (M. A.) [...] California State University San Marcos, 2011 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 52 - 53) The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effect of Career Technical Education (CTE) on students' attitudes about their <b>reading,</b> writing, <b>and</b> <b>math</b> skills. This research responds directly to the need for additional research of benefits of CTE. Previous research noted that more research needed to be conducted using qualitative research models. Only a small percentage of articles published about CTE are from qualitative research. Additionally there is not enough research that looked into the possibility that students taking CTE courses developed a better since of self-efficacy and had a perceived change in attitude toward their own academic achievement (Rojewski, Asunda, & Kim, 2008). Pre and post surveys were collected from 103 seventy and eight grade students currently enrolled in CTE courses. The surveys provided both qualitative and quantitative data for analysis. Factors such as, how the students felt about their <b>reading,</b> writing, <b>and</b> <b>math</b> skills before <b>and</b> after participating in CTE course work were evaluated. This research provides documentation of how CTE affected the students' attitudes about their abilities in the areas of <b>reading,</b> writing, <b>and</b> <b>math.</b> Specifically, the research question that guided this investigation was: What is the effect, if any, of Career Technical Education on students' attitudes toward achievement? The findings confirmed that students who received CTE instruction showed their attitudes about their ability to <b>read,</b> write, <b>and</b> do <b>math</b> improved significantly after participating in the cours...|$|R
