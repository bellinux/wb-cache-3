5|$|Agriculture, {{largely based}} on livestock, has {{traditionally}} been the main occupation in the central and western parts of the county. There are a mix of large and small farm businesses, and a thriving dairy sector in the Vale of Clwyd. Many of the towns have livestock markets and the farming industry supports farm machinery merchants, vets, feed merchants, contractors and all the ancillary trades connected with agriculture. With their incomes on the decline, farmers have found opportunities in tourism, <b>rural</b> <b>crafts,</b> specialist food shops, farmers' markets and value-added food products.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, West Wales was {{identified}} as the worst-performing region in the United Kingdom along with the South Wales Valleys. The gross value added economic indicator showed a figure of £14,763 per head in these regions, as compared with a GVA of £22,986 for Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. The Welsh Assembly Government is aware of this, and helped by government initiatives and local actions, opportunities for farmers to diversify have emerged. These include farm tourism, <b>rural</b> <b>crafts,</b> specialist food shops, farmers' markets and added-value food products.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, the declining {{population}} trend had gone into reverse. Increasing numbers of retired people were arriving to make their home in the tranquil surroundings, and after the Beacham Commission in the 1960s, the British government realised that the rural way of life in parts of Wales was in crisis, and started to react. Through government initiatives and local actions, opportunities in tourism, <b>rural</b> <b>crafts,</b> specialist food shops, farmers' markets and added-value food products began to emerge. However, in 2011, at 3.1%, Ceredigion still had one of the highest proportions of its population working in agriculture, forestry and fishing, close behind such other places as Orkney and Shetland. Another use for marginal land in exposed positions is the provision of renewable wind energy; Cefn Croes Wind Farm near Devil's Bridge has 39 turbines and a nominal capacity of 58,500kW.|$|E

25|$|The Beck Isle Museum {{is housed}} in a Regency period {{residence}} near the centre of town, adjacent to the Pickering Beck, a stream that flows under a four-arched road bridge. It was here that William Marshall planned England's first Agricultural Institute in the early 19th century. The house contains a collection of bygones relating to the <b>rural</b> <b>crafts</b> and living style of Ryedale. The collection is not restricted to a particular period, but aims to reflect local life and customs and trace the developments in social and domestic life during the last 200 years. A selection of photographs from the Sidney Smith collection held in the museum are displayed around the building, particularly in the photography and model rooms. Sidney Smith was born in Pickering. He is {{thought of as a}} successor to Frank Meadow Sutcliffe of Whitby. The museum is owned by the Beck Isle Museum Trust and is staffed and operated by volunteers.|$|E
2500|$|Isabella's {{new husband}} Edward {{was an unusual}} {{character}} by medieval standards. Edward looked {{the part of a}} Plantagenet king to perfection. He was tall, athletic, and wildly popular {{at the beginning of his}} reign. He rejected most of the traditional pursuits of a king for the period– jousting, hunting and warfare– and instead enjoyed music, poetry and many <b>rural</b> <b>crafts.</b> Furthermore, there is the question of Edward's sexuality in a period when homosexuality of any sort was considered a very serious crime, but there is no direct evidence of his sexual orientation. However, contemporary chroniclers made much of his close affinity with a succession of male favourites; some condemned Edward for loving them [...] "beyond measure" [...] and [...] "uniquely", others explicitly referring to an [...] "illicit and sinful union". Nonetheless, Isabella bore four children by Edward, leading to an opinion amongst some historians that Edward's affairs with his male favourites may have been platonic.|$|E
50|$|Kibori kuma (木彫り熊) is a Japanese <b>rural</b> <b>craft</b> that {{consists}} of a wooden carving of a bear with a fish in its mouth. The sculptures are mainly produced in Hokkaido; small carvings are sold as souvenirs of the island.

40|$|A Research Report Submitted to the Faculty of Humanities, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in Partial Fulfilment of the Requirements for the Degree of Master of Arts February 2014 The report {{explores the}} South African craft policy {{framework}} using, as a case-study, the iSimangaliso Craft Programme in KwaZulu-Natal, and {{its attempts to}} assist <b>rural</b> women <b>craft</b> producers through a partnership with a major South African home décor chain store. The purpose {{was to examine the}} feasibility of South African craft policy in the rural context, the extent to which rural women benefit from craft production and sales in the market economy; and the constraints on the actors in the craft sector (including the crafters) with regards to the creation or transformation of <b>rural</b> <b>craft</b> producers into small, micro and medium enterprises (SMMEs). The study used the Sustainable Livelihoods (SL) framework to shift the research focus away from craft for economic benefit to the broader perspective of ‘tangible and intangible costs and benefits’. The livelihood outcomes the women crafters pursued, the strategies they adopted to achieve them, {{and the extent to which}} the Craft Programme fitted into their lives were examined. An actor-oriented approach helped determine the ‘social interface’ or dynamics between the actors in the sector when they try to implement craft policy. The research was qualitative, and mixed methods such as semi-structured interviews and focus groups were used to gather data. Thematic content analysis was used to mine data for information relating to the main research questions. The study found that the women crafters draw on multiple strategies to cope and that craft is desirable for its ability to ‘fit’ with other livelihood strategies. The study also found that SMME development policy created a strain on both craft producers and government agencies. It is suggested that a ‘context-sensitive’ and people-centred framework for craft development is needed. The South African government needs to consider the contexts of craft producers and develop appropriate interventions aligned to the social and economic outcomes that people pursue. One possible option is the social enterprise ‘market intermediary’ model which provides services to its target population to help them access markets. This model could leverage resources from both sectors to create truly economic and social value for <b>rural</b> <b>craft</b> producers...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{wide range}} of {{information}} available on by-product disposal methods used by large national breweries. However, little information is available on the methods of by-product disposal used by craft breweries. An investigation was carried out in which 200 + British craft brewers were contacted, of which 90 craft brewers provided basic information about their brewery operations and by-product disposal. Representatives of eleven breweries were interviewed to provide an in-depth case study of their by-product disposal methods. The research found that urban craft brewers use a wider range of disposal methods compared to <b>rural</b> <b>craft</b> brewers; urban brewers dispose of more waste through sewage and landfill, as well as using external companies, such as bio-recycling and anaerobic digester plants, whereas rural brewers have relationships with farmers who dispose of the by-products in various ways.

Other project attributes discussed include program size (68 RCTC's in 1978; 2, 000 SSM villages in 1977), funding sources (RCTC funds are raised locally;,local contributions and foreign philanthropic organizations support the SSM), and curriculum (both projects respond to local needs). A comparison of the projects shows that while both were founded to help the rural poor, RCTC's were begun'-by foreigners and are both capitalistic and decentralized. The SSM, however, is much larger in size and budget. It is voluntary, socialistic, moralistic, spiritualistic, and was founded by people indigenous to Sri Lanka. Five tables provide data on educational opportunity in Kenya, government-approved RCTC's, subjects taught in RCTC's and the SSM, and the SSM budget (1977 - 78).
