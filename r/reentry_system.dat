The first step was to take an inventory of the status achieved with reentry technologies within Germany based on the German shares in the HERMES program, the capsules EXPRESS and MIRKA, the secondary payload mission of material samples on a Russian FOTON capsule, the hypersonic technology program, and the BREM-SAT satellite. It turned out that in the HERMES, EXPRESS and hypersonic technology programs, the relatively most significant technological gains had been achieved in the sector of reentry. The two most research-intensive technology sectors, at the same time being of high relevance to all <b>reentry</b> <b>systems,</b> are represented by the fields of structural designs, materials and structures, and aerothermodynamics. In the field of flight guidance and control, avionics and navigation, a commitment on the basis of previous activities appears to be appropriate in particular due to the attractive cost-benefit ratio with comparatively low investment.

50|$|Practical {{development}} of <b>reentry</b> <b>systems</b> began as {{the range and}} reentry velocity of ballistic missiles increased. For early short-range missiles, like the V-2, stabilization and aerodynamic stress were important issues (many V-2s broke apart during reentry), but heating was not a serious problem. Medium-range missiles like the Soviet R-5, with a 1200 km range, required ceramic composite heat shielding on separable reentry vehicles (it was no longer possible for the entire rocket structure to survive re-entry). The first ICBMs, with ranges of 8000 to 12,000 km, were only possible with the {{development of}} modern ablative heat shields and blunt-shaped vehicles.

40|$|The {{recidivism}} rate of ex-offenders in America {{continues to}} increase each decade, and each decade {{the debate on the}} subject of recidivism begins and ends with nothing truly accomplished. Many studies on this subject state that it is through rehabilitation that the recidivism rate can truly be reduced. Can the recidivism rate be lowered with a revision of the reentry and rehabilitation programs available to ex-offenders? After analyzing three states identified as having the best, worst, and mid-range <b>reentry</b> <b>systems</b> in the country, it was concluded in this thesis that the key to reducing recidivism is to create a national recidivism program by which all states can follow. This program needs to have a centralized management structure, be adequately funded, address issues such as ex-offender housing, finding affordable health insurance for ex-offenders, reducing the effects of prisonization, helping ex-offenders to find employment and maintaining inmates relationships with family members, and continuing education for skill enhancement. By adequately addressing these issues and centralizing the management of the reentry programs nationwide, a reduction of the recidivism rate should follow. ...|$|R

50|$|The Russian Progress vehicle {{has long}} {{served as a}} cargo vehicle which, upon departing a space station, destructively reenters the {{atmosphere}} destroying all “cargo” on board. This approach works very effectively for removing unwanted mass from a space station. However, NASA has indicated that the return of payloads from the ISS is highly desirable 5. Therefore, a commercial system must examine the implications of including a pressurized payload return capability either in the initial design or as an enhanced feature of the service to be introduced in the future. Providing such capability requires the incorporation of thermal protection subsystem, deorbit targeting subsystems, landing recovery subsystems, ground recovery infrastructure, and FAA licensure. The recovery of unpressurized payloads presents unique challenges associated with the exposed nature of unpressurized carriers. To implement a recoverable <b>reentry</b> <b>system</b> for unpressurized payloads requires {{the development of an}} encapsulation system. Encapsulation activities must either occur autonomously prior to reentry or {{as a part of the}} operations associated with loading the unpressurized cargo carrier with return cargo.

50|$|Since {{the return}} capsule of Hayabusa Mk2 will enter Earth's {{atmosphere}} at the velocity beyond 14 km/s, a technology demonstrator called DASH-II was proposed within the JAXA Space Exploration Center (JSPEC).

The estimated aerodynamic heat load on the capsule is extremely high (at least 20 MW/m2)even by selecting a shallow entry flight path angle. Because the ground heating facilities for TPS development never simultaneously duplicate the flight environment quantities such as the heat flux, the flow enthalpy, the chemical composition, the dynamic pressure, and the radiation so on, a real flight experiment is likely to be necessary. The main objective of the mission is to acquire and demonstrate the reentry/entry technologies associated with future planetary exploration and high-speed reentry missions. DASH-II was supposed to be launched by the same H-IIA rocket with the cancelled ASTRO-G space craft, as a subpayload, on 2013. In 2008, DASH-II was in Pre-Phase-A (working group activities).|$|E

From the 1950 s to the 1970 s, there was considerable work on magnetohydrodynamic <b>reentry</b> <b>systems</b> and related technology. The recent resurgence in the field was stimulated by the disclosure of the Soviet AJAX vehicle concept in the mid- 1990 s. This led to an extraordinary international collaboration that has now lasted almost twenty years. Plasma-based flow control seems quite feasible, particularly for local flow control applications where power consumption is low. Plasma-based devices have a low profile, and can provide actuation over short time scales. Plasmaenhanced combustion is a very promising area for both low- and high-speed regimes. Discharges are already being used to break down fuels, enhance ignition, provide flameholding, and promote combustion efficiency. There are a number of potential breakthrough areas in the field that could have strong technological impact on the aerospace industry. Industry seems to be receptive to the adoption of plasma-based technology, but has reservations about technical risk, performance, reliability, and integration. There is a need to identify applications where plasma devices are significantly better than completing technologies, and to demonstrate prototypes in an operational environment. With a century of atmospheric flight and half a century of spaceflight behind us, the aerospace sciences remain a vigorous and exciting field.
