5|$|On March 11, 1985, {{power in}} the Soviet Union was assumed by Mikhail Gorbachev. The {{worsening}} economic situation in the entire Eastern Bloc, including the Soviet Union, together with other factors, forced Gorbachev {{to carry out a}} number of reforms, not only in the field of economics (uskoreniye) but in the political and social realms (glasnost and perestroika). Gorbachev's policies soon caused a corresponding shift in the policies of Soviet satellites, including the People's <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland.</b>|$|E
5|$|Derived {{from early}} Slavic flag-like objects, a royal banner of arms dates {{as far back}} as the 11th century CE. A symbol of royal authority, it was used at coronations and in battles. In the interwar period, it was {{replaced}} with the Banner of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland,</b> which was part of the presidential insignia. A national banner is not mentioned in the current (2007) regulations on Polish national symbols, although today's presidential jack is based directly on the pre-war design for the Banner of the Republic.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{some social}} scientists, such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Frank Gibney, refer to these changes as a revolution, one less {{dramatic}} than its Hungarian counterpart but one {{which may have}} had an even more profound impact on the Eastern Bloc. Timothy Garton Ash calls the Polish October the most significant event in the post-war history of Poland until the rise of Solidarity. History professor Iván T. Berend claims that while {{the effects of the}} Polish October on the Eastern Bloc may be disputed, it set the course for the eventual fall of communism in the People's <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland.</b>|$|E

5|$|Originally {{used only}} by the Navy, {{the use of these}} rank flags was {{extended}} in 2005 to all branches of the Armed Forces by an amendment to the relevant ministerial ordinance.

The date was chosen {{to coincide with the}} Polonia Day traditionally observed by the Polish diaspora outside Poland and the Polish Senate on May 2. There was also a historical reason: under the Communist regime, May 2 was a day when national flags, hoisted for Labor Day on May 1 were being quickly removed before Polish Constitution Day (May 3), which was banned by the authorities.|$|E
5|$|The city of Poznań {{was one of}} {{the largest}} urban and {{industrial}} centers of the People's <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland.</b> Tensions were growing there, particularly since autumn of 1955. Workers in the largest factory in the city, Joseph Stalin's (or 'Cegielski's) Metal Industries, were complaining about higher taxes for most productive workers (udarnik), which affected several thousands of workers. Local directors were unable to make any significant decisions due to micromanagement by the higher officials; over several months, petitions, letters and delegations were sent to the Polish Ministry of Machine Industry and Central Committee of Polish United Workers' Party, to no avail.|$|E

5|$|According {{to friends}} and family, he had {{extensive}} historical knowledge and was deeply disillusioned with the reality <b>of</b> communist <b>Poland.</b> He supported the protesting students during the March 1968 Polish political crisis in Poland, printing bibuła leaflets and asking his daughter to distribute them. According to health professionals, he was of sound mind, and fully rational, {{at the time of}} his suicide. Siwiec planned his self-immolation months in advance, writing out a last will in April, and leaving written and tape-recorded statements explaining his revulsion at both the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and the People's <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland's</b> participation in it.|$|R
5|$|The {{communist}} Polish United Workers' Party dissolved {{itself in}} 1990 and {{transformed into the}} Social Democracy of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland.</b> The Warsaw Pact was formally dissolved on 1 July 1991; the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991 and the last post-Soviet troops left Poland in September 1993. On 27 October 1991, the first entirely free Polish parliamentary elections since the 1920s took place. This completed Poland's transition from a communist party rule to a Western-style liberal democratic political system.|$|E
5|$|With {{help from}} American colleagues, Znaniecki {{obtained}} {{an extension of}} his appointment at Columbia University through mid-1940.

He taught at the University of Illinois until his retirement, deciding not {{to return to the}} communist People's <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland,</b> established in the aftermath of World War II (despite the offer of a chair at Poznań University). In 1950 he retired, becoming a professor emeritus.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} both sides claimed victory and modern views {{as to who}} won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no {{strategic}} impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held {{until the end of}} the war. Polish historiography during the People's <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> portrayed the battle as difficult, but victorious. After the fall of communism, Polish historians became much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming the near destruction of the Polish force on his incompetence and desire to capture Dresden. The battle's outcome is now generally seen in Poland as a very costly victory for the Soviets and their Polish allies.|$|E

50|$|The Second Polish <b>Republic</b> was one <b>of</b> the signatories to the 1925 International Opium Convention, which {{entered into}} force in 1928, which imposed some {{restrictions}} on the trade and production of cannabis and related goods. Cannabis was first explicitly mentioned in Polish legislation of 1930, and classified as harmful to health. The People's <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Poland's</b> legislation <b>of</b> 1951 classified cannabis as a narcotic, and successive legislation made production and dealing in it illegal, however possession and use were not a crime until 1997. The Polish legislation of 1997 was the first that criminalized possession of narcotics, including cannabis.|$|R
50|$|In {{the past}} - {{the times of}} the Second Polish <b>Republic,</b> {{partitions}} <b>of</b> <b>Poland</b> and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth - the number of Russians within Polish borders was much higher, over 100,000.
