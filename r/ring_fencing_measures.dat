40|$|Whilst some {{valid and}} {{justified}} arguments {{have been put}} forward in favour of <b>ring</b> <b>fencing,</b> that is, constructing a fire-wall between consumer and investment banks, and that such activities can be achieved without re structuring banks into separate legal entities, the Liikanen Report highlights why there is need for such re structuring. As well as considering the merits of ringfencing {{and the establishment of}} separate legal activities and entities, this paper aims to highlight why a suitable model aimed at mitigating risks of contagion can to a large extent, be justified on a cost-benefit analysis basis. Furthermore, the paper ultimately concludes that even though a greater degree of separation of legal entities and activities persist with the model which is referred to as „total separation“, a certain degree of independence between bank activities would also be necessary under <b>ring</b> <b>fencing</b> if its purposes and objectives are to be fulfilled. ...|$|R

However, the new tax is also applied to all adults and not just once per household, meaning in essence that under the new system, some will pay less than before and others will pay more. Very low-income earners are completely exempt from the Yle tax.|$|R

50|$|The {{remainder}} of the 1980s saw STC lose its way. An attempt to enter the mainframe computer market with the takeover of ICL, led to financial strains. The rationale was the convergence of computing and telecoms but the vision was too early.

By 1991, with an aging workforce, loss of business from the newly privatised BT, production spread over too many expensive sites and no clear leadership succession to its former chairman, Sir Kenneth Corfield, STC was bought by Northern Telecom (Nortel).|$|R
