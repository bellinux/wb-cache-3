6000|$|She <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> {{against the}} comfortable, rough, heather-smelling {{shoulder}} of her father's coat, while he patted her and smiled, [...] "Good girl! I {{better get out}} and help." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose we're all cowards when {{it comes}} to the point," [...] said Mrs. Flushing, <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> against the back of the chair. [...] "I'm sure I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|She <b>rubs</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> against his. Feeling that he {{does not}} rub [...] his cheek against hers, OLIVE stands away, and looks from him to [...] her mother in wonder.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You're {{much too}} young, and he's your cousin!' But what a father {{ought to say}} {{appeared}} to him just then both sensible and ridiculous. Nedda <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> against his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah but you {{scarcely}} {{take for}} granted I do!" [...] She <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> an instant with the polished silver and again the next moment turned over the case. [...] "This {{is the kind of}} one I should like." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{when she}} had <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> and {{smoothed}} <b>her</b> face, she was no nearer to feeling that she could trust herself. What had happened in her was too violent, too sweet, too terrifying. And going up to him she said: ...|$|R
6000|$|She <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> against his. [...] "Now we must run," [...] she said. She {{quickly turned}} back to the shadow of the board-walk, to draw on her {{stockings}} and shoes, kneeling on the sand like the simple maid of the ballads which she had been envying.|$|R
60|$|Christian bent {{her head}} forward and <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> against Greta's, then without another word ran upstairs and locked herself into her room. The child stood listening; hearing the key turn in the lock, she sank down on the bottom step and took Scruff in her arms.|$|R
6000|$|Nasha paused, <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b> There {{was a deep}} scratch there, still red and swollen. [...] "Then how do you explain--it? According to {{your theory}} the {{inhabitants}} must have died in their skins, fried like yams. But who fired on us? Somebody detected us, made a decision, aimed a gun." ...|$|R
6000|$|She sank by the bed, pitifully <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> {{against the}} silk {{comforter}} that was primly awaiting her commands {{at the foot}} of the bed, and cried, [...] "Oh, four-posters are necessary! I can't give them up! I won't! They---- No one has a right to ask me." [...] She mentally stamped her foot. [...] "I simply won't live in a shack and take in washing. It isn't worth it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My rouge won't come off." [...] and Amy <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> {{brilliant}} <b>cheek,</b> {{and showed}} him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh outright.|$|R
60|$|June, who {{by nature}} {{never saw a}} hornet's nest until she had put her head into it, was seriously alarmed. She came and slipped her arm through his. Not {{convinced}} that he was right, and she herself wrong, because that was not natural to her, she was yet profoundly impressed by the obvious fact that the subject was very bad for him. She <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> against his shoulder, and said nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it a {{crime to}} try and look my best when YOU come here?" [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Rawdon plaintively, and she <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> with <b>her</b> handkerchief as if to show there was no rouge at all, only genuine blushes and modesty in her case. About this who can tell? I know there is some rouge that won't come off on a pocket-handkerchief, and some so good that even tears will not disturb it.|$|R
60|$|Resting <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> forefinger, {{she waited}} {{to be told}} what circumstance.|$|R
60|$|MALISE. We're {{not going}} to let them down us, are we? [She <b>rubs</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> against his hand, that still rests on her shoulder] Life on sufferance, breath at the {{pleasure}} of the enemy! And some day in the fullness of his mercy to be made a present of the right to eat and drink and breathe again. [His gesture sums up the rage within him] Fine! [He puts his hat on and rises] That's the last groan they get from me.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} wear red till {{you get more}} color, dear;" [...] and his sister <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> {{blooming}} <b>cheek</b> against his pale one, as if to lend him some of her own roses.|$|R
60|$|A short, deep chuckle escaped him--although {{the next}} moment his face became serious again. But Pansy in the mean time had taken {{possession}} of his coat sleeve and was <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> against it like a young colt. At which the colonel succumbed feebly {{and sat down on}} the sofa, the child standing beside him, leaning over and transferring her little hands to the lapels of his frock coat, which she essayed to button over his chest as she looked into his murky eyes.|$|R
60|$|Jonas went {{up towards}} the fire. The hearth was very large, and formed of great, flat stones. On {{one side of}} it was a large heap of wood, which Jonas had {{prepared}} the night before, to be ready for his fire. On the other side was a black cat asleep, with her chin upon her paws. When the cat heard Jonas coming, she rose up, stretched out her fore paws, and then began to purr, <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> against the bottom of the settle.|$|R
6000|$|... “As {{the society}} belle {{said when she}} left the mark of <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>on</b> the gent’s shoulder,” remarked Buster Beggs, the fat lad of the group.|$|R
60|$|Mary rested <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> hand, {{and looked}} at him with her grave steady face, not very much discomposed after the first glimpse of his meaning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't say that, father!" [...] cried his {{daughter}} Hannah, laying <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>on</b> his arm, and hugging it. [...] "There's ever so much life in you yet." ...|$|R
5000|$|She is {{also often}} {{appeared}} with attributes of Chalchiuhtlicue, such as her headdress {{and the short}} lines <b>rubbing</b> down <b>her</b> <b>cheeks.</b> She is usually distinguished by being shown carrying ears of maize. [...] She is shown in three different forms: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} lady, resting <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> hand and gazing on the fire, [...] "it's all very interesting; and so odd that you two men, with {{nearly the same}} experiences, should be neighbors." ...|$|R
6000|$|She delicately leaned <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>on</b> a finger-tip and sighed: [...] "Yes, I {{wonder if}} we shall ever be so happy as when we were young.... I don't believe you care to play with me so much now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' she answered, and {{she pushed}} back her sleeve, {{revealing}} a fine, strong arm, which was scarlet {{on the outer}} side from shoulder to wrist, like some long, red-burned fruit. The girl laid <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>on</b> the smarting soft flesh caressively.|$|R
6000|$|For all {{she was a}} Cockney, {{hers was}} a simple soul, associating Peace with Good-will. Drying her tears, she stood up, and in the little cheap mirror above the empty grate looked at her face. It was lined, and she was grey; {{for more than two}} years her man had not seen her without her hat. What ever would he say? And she <b>rubbed</b> and <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> trying to smooth them out. Then her {{conscience}} smote her, and she ran upstairs to the back bedroom, where the deaf aunt lay. Taking up the little amateur ear trumpet which Gerhardt himself had made for [...] "auntie," [...] before he was taken away, she bawled into it: ...|$|R
60|$|She now {{occupied}} {{herself at}} the bookcase for nearly an hour; taking down volume after volume, and renewing her acquaintance with each. This done, she seated herself on a low stool, rested <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> hand, and thought, and still was mute.|$|R
6000|$|Hatred and {{contempt}} hissed in her utterance {{of the word}} [...] "finances," [...] but {{at the very moment}} she gently stroked the cat reposing in her arms. She even raised them slightly, and inclining <b>her</b> head <b>rubbed</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> against the fur of the animal, which received this caress with the complete detachment so characteristic of its kind. Then looking at Miss Haldin she excused herself once more for not taking her upstairs to Madame S-- The interview could not be interrupted. Presently the journalist would be seen coming down the stairs. The best thing was to remain in the hall; and besides, all these rooms (she glanced all round at the many doors), all these rooms on the ground floor were unfurnished.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said. [...] "I didn't {{think you}} could do the bed so nicely," [...] she added, almost gaily. Then she curled up, with <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> hand, her head snugged between her {{shoulder}}s. Paul put the long thin plait of grey hair {{over her shoulder and}} kissed her.|$|R
60|$|She {{came up to}} Bradley timidly, {{a longing}} mixed with pride {{expressed}} in her face. Bradley took her in his arms, and laid <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder. She stood before him like a mother now. He felt her pride in him, and she had grown very dear to him.|$|R
60|$|He {{slipped out}} of bed. A bud of gas was burning in the sick chamber. His mother lay with <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> hand, curled up as {{she had gone to}} sleep. But her mouth had fallen open, and she breathed with great, hoarse breaths, like snoring, and there were long {{intervals}} between.|$|R
5000|$|Built in 1601 on {{the order}} of the first Nguyễn lords, Nguyễn Hoàng, who at that time was the {{governor}} of Thuận Hóa (now known as Huế). The Nguyen Lords were in name, officials of the ruling Lê Dynasty in Hanoi, but was the de facto independent ruler of central Vietnam. According to the royal annals, Hoang while touring the vicinity, was told of the local legend in which an old lady, known as Thiên Mụ (literally [...] "celestial lady"), dressed in red and blue sat at the site, <b>rubbing</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheeks.</b> She foretold that a lord would come and erect a pagoda on the hill to pray for the country's prosperity. She then vanished after making her prophecy. Upon hearing this, Hoang ordered the construction of a temple at the site, thus the beginning of Thiên Mụ Tự.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} face, resting <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>on</b> {{the palm of}} her hand. There was a light in her eyes that made the {{expression}} of them tender. Mr. Hoopdriver had not looked in her face while he had talked. He had regarded the grass, and pointed his remarks with redknuckled hands held open and palms upwards. Now they hung limply over his knees.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a long}} silence. Poppy got up {{and crossed}} to the window, and, resting <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> hand, sat {{watching}} the restless life of the street. The room darkened slowly with the approach of evening. Flower rose and took the seat opposite, and Fraser, who had been feeling in the way for some time, said that he must go.|$|R
50|$|Penelope is {{recognizable}} in Greek and Roman works, from Attic vase-paintings—the Penelope Painter {{is recognized}} by his representations of her—to Roman sculpture copying or improvising upon classical Greek models, by her seated pose, by her reflective gesture of leaning <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> hand, and by her protectively crossed knees, reflecting her long chastity in Odysseus' absence, an unusual pose {{in any other}} figure.|$|R
6000|$|We {{learn to}} {{restrain}} ourselves {{as we get}} older. We keep apart when we have quarrelled, express ourselves in well-bred phrases, {{and in this way}} preserve a dignified alienation, showing much firmness on one side, and swallowing much grief on the other. We no longer approximate in our behavior to the mere impulsiveness of the lower animals, but conduct ourselves in every respect like members of a highly civilized society. Maggie and Tom were still very much like young animals, and so she could <b>rub</b> <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> against his, and kiss his ear in a random sobbing way; and there were tender fibres in the lad that had been used to answer to Maggie's fondling, so that he behaved with a weakness quite inconsistent with his resolution to punish her as much as she deserved. He actually began to kiss her in return, and say,-- ...|$|R
