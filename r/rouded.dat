40|$|The {{cooperative}} French-Iranian Paleoanthropological Project (FIPP) discovered three Paleolithic localities in Central Alborz, Northern Iran {{during its}} 2005 field mission. In the northern foothills near Baliran in Mazandârân province, Garm <b>Roud</b> yielded an open-air site with an archaeological layer {{attributable to the}} last glacial period that dates {{from the end of}} OIS 3 (28, 486 ± 190 cal BP). These geochronological data and the typo-technical observations converge to place the Garm <b>Roud</b> 2 assemblage in the Upper Paleolithic. Garm <b>Roud</b> 2 is thus the first site of this kind discovered in the area. In the southern foothills near Damâvand in Tehran province, Moghanak and Otchounak represent two open-air surface localities with lithic assemblages of Mousterian to Ante-Mousterian affinity.
