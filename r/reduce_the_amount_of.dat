5|$|In May 2013, {{following}} a twelve-year absence from All My Children, Nader was announced to be reprising {{the role of}} Dimitri, scheduled to begin in June. Initially his first airdate was 3 June, however, due to Prospect Park's decision to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> episodes made available each week, he did not air until 12 June.|$|E
5|$|Originally made {{by farmers}} to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> waste from their milk, clotted cream {{has become so}} deep-rooted {{in the culture of}} {{southwest}} Britain that it is embedded as part of the region's tourist attraction. While there is no doubt of its strong and long association with Cornwall and Devon, it is not clear of its actual antiquity, or more recent development.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} {{treatments}} available for acne from reducing sugars in the diet, to medications that include antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, retinoids and hormonal treatments. Retinoids <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> sebum {{produced by the}} sebaceous glands. Should the usual treatments fail, {{the presence of the}} Demodex mite could be looked for as the possible cause.|$|E
5|$|A major {{technological}} {{application of}} this information is metabolic engineering. Here, organisms such as yeast, plants or bacteria are genetically modified {{to make them more}} useful in biotechnology and aid the production of drugs such as antibiotics or industrial chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol and shikimic acid. These genetic modifications usually aim to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> energy used to produce the product, increase yields and reduce the production of wastes.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} La Plata, Argentina shows the {{potential}} for planarians such as Girardia anceps, Mesostoma ehrenbergii, and Bothromesostoma evelinae to reduce populations of the mosquito species Aedes aegypti and Culex pipiens. The experiment showed that G. anceps in particular can prey on all instars of both mosquito species and maintain a steady predation rate over time. The ability for these flatworms to live in artificial containers showed the potential of placing these species in popular mosquito breeding sites, which would ideally <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> mosquito-borne diseases.|$|E

5|$|After the discovery, {{the rare}} element had only minor applications; for example, {{by the turn}} of the century, rhodium-containing {{thermocouples}} were used to measure temperatures up to 1800°C. The first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion-resistant coating. The introduction of the three-way catalytic converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium. The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium, while the three-way catalytic converter used rhodium to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> NOx in the exhaust.|$|E
5|$|Arad's {{police force}} {{was chosen as}} the {{exceptional}} force for 2007, and awarded an award of excellence on 5 March 2008. Among others, a severe reduction in property crime was cited. Arad's force was able to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> such crimes from 1,092 in 2003 to just 168 in 2007. On 18 July 2008, Arad police, in a rare incident, shot dead a man threatening to kill his ex-wife with a knife.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the summer, Wolfe's focus changed, possibly due to frustration with Montcalm's tactics. Wolfe's troops, along with American Rangers, attacked and destroyed small French settlements along the St. Lawrence. An estimated 1,400 stone houses and manors were destroyed, and many colonists killed. The effort was likely an attempt to force Montcalm's army out of its fortifications, but was unsuccessful. However, the attacks did <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> supplies available to the French, especially as the British navy, unable to control the St. Lawrence entirely, was successfully blockading the ports in France.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{is used in}} {{high voltage}} power cables as {{sheathing}} material to prevent water diffusion into insulation; this use is decreasing as lead is being phased out. Its use in solder for electronics is also being phased out by some countries to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> environmentally hazardous waste. Lead {{is one of three}} metals used in the Oddy test for museum materials, helping detect organic acids, aldehydes, and acidic gases.|$|E
5|$|Sandusky {{included}} features {{designed by}} Thomas Rogers {{that had not}} been seen in locomotive construction to date. It was also the first locomotive to use cast iron driving wheels, and the wheels included built-in counterweights to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> wear on the track caused by the weight of the driving rod and wheel all coming down at once during the wheels' rotations. Before Sanduskys construction, driving wheels were typically built with wooden spokes, much like wagon wheels. Some accounts also state that Sandusky was the first locomotive to feature a whistle, but this has since been proven false.|$|E
5|$|Stacking or rigging the subwoofers in a {{vertical}} array focuses the low frequencies {{forward to a}} greater or lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. This helps <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> low frequency sound bouncing off the ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.|$|E

5|$|The Australian bush fly, Musca vetustissima, {{is a major}} {{nuisance}} pest in Australia, but native decomposers {{found in}} Australia are not adapted to feeding on cow dung, which is where bush flies breed. Therefore, the Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), led by George Bornemissza of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, released forty-nine species of dung beetle, to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> dung and therefore also the potential breeding sites of the fly.|$|E
5|$|The {{pancreatic}} islets {{make up the}} endocrine part of the pancreas, and synthesize and secrete hormones including insulin {{into the}} bloodstream. There {{is evidence that the}} beta cells in the islets that synthesize insulin contain dopamine receptors, and that dopamine acts to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> insulin they release. The source of their dopamine input is not clearly established—it may come from dopamine that circulates in the bloodstream and derives from the sympathetic nervous system, or it may be synthesized locally by other types of pancreatic cells.|$|E
5|$|The phase-amplitude {{converter}} {{creates the}} sample-domain waveform from the truncated phase output word {{received from the}} PA. The PAC can be a simple read only memory containing 2M contiguous samples of the desired output waveform which typically is a sinusoid. Often though, various tricks are employed to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> memory required. This include various trigonometric expansions, trigonometric approximations and methods which {{take advantage of the}} quadrature symmetry exhibited by sinusoids. Alternatively, the PAC may consist of random access memory which can be filled as desired to create an arbitrary waveform generator.|$|E

5|$|Bormann {{was one of}} {{the leading}} proponents of the ongoing {{persecution}} of the Christian churches. In February 1937 he decreed that members of the clergy should not be admitted to the NSDAP. The following year he ruled that any members of the clergy who were holding party offices should be dismissed, and that any party member who was considering entering the clergy had to give up his party membership. While Bormann's push to force the closure of theological departments at Reich universities was unsuccessful, he was able to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> religious instruction provided in public schools to two hours per week and mandated the removal of crucifixes from classrooms. Speer notes in his memoirs that while drafting plans for Welthauptstadt Germania, the planned rebuilding of Berlin, he was told by Bormann that churches were not to be allocated any building sites.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland and Treasury Secretary Daniel Manning stood {{firmly on}} the side of the gold standard, and tried to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> silver that the {{government}} was required to coin under the Bland-Allison Act of 1878. Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated. Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents. In reply, one of the foremost silverites, Richard P. Bland, introduced a bill in 1886 that would require the government to coin unlimited amounts of silver, inflating the then-deflating currency. While Bland's bill was defeated, so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement. The result was a retention of the status quo, and a postponement of the resolution of the Free Silver issue.|$|E
5|$|In Bethlehem, a {{southern}} suburb of Albany, NY32 was originally routed on Feura Bush Road between the hamlets of Feura Bush and Glenmont. North of Glenmont, NY32 followed {{what is now}} NY144. In 1956, the Albany County Board of Supervisors asked the state of New York to develop a highway that would <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> traffic on NY43 (now NY443) in Bethlehem. The original plans released by the state in 1959 called for a four-lane divided highway between NY85 in New Scotland and US9W in Bethlehem. The new road, known as the Delmar Bypass, would run south of the hamlets of Slingerlands, Delmar, and Elsmere, and loosely parallel Feura Bush Road to the north between Elm Avenue and US9W.|$|E
