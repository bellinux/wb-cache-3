But the ratings need to be reliable as well as easy to use for both respondents and researchers. Three one-question <b>rating</b> <b>types</b> were compared in a study with 26 participants who attempted the same five tasks with two software applications. The types were a Likert scale, a Usability Magnitude Estimation (UME) judgment, and a Subjective Mental Effort Question (SMEQ).

30|$|Beauty and cuteness are {{considered}} to represent different aspects of attractiveness and to be distinguishable from each other by their respective reliance on neonate and sexually mature features found in attractive faces. In this study, we investigated whether baby schema features in adult faces affect not only cuteness, but also beauty and attractiveness. We also investigated possible differences among attractiveness, beauty, and cuteness, and possible effects of perceived youth on these judgments. Results showed that baby schema features affected judgments of attractiveness, beauty, and cuteness, but that perceived youth did not significantly influence these judgments. Furthermore, the effect of each facial feature differed across <b>rating</b> <b>types</b> with the participants’ naïve interpretation of rating categories. This suggests that beauty predominantly refers to sexual attraction, while attractiveness refers to a non-sexual attraction regardless of participants’ gender. However, gender differences may exist in judging cuteness. Therefore, expressions related to attractiveness may incorporate different elements and this distinction may not be fully shared across gender.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that there is a {{difference}} between recognized and induced emotion in music listening. In this study, empathy is tested as a possible moderator between recognition and induction that is, on its own, moderated via music preference evaluations and other individual and situational features. Preference was also tested to determine whether it had an effect on measures of emotion independently from emotional expression. A web-based experiment gathered from 3, 164 music listeners emotion, empathy, and preference ratings in a between-subjects design embedded in a music-personality test. Stimuli were a sample of 23 musical excerpts (each 30 seconds long, five randomly assigned to each participant) from various musical styles chosen to represent different emotions and preferences. Listeners in the recognition rating condition rated measures of valence and arousal significantly differently than listeners in the felt rating condition. Empathy ratings were shown to modulate this relationship: when empathy was present, the difference between the two <b>rating</b> <b>types</b> was reduced. Furthermore, we confirmed preference as one major predictor of empathy ratings. Emotional contagion was tested and confirmed as an additional direct effect of emotional expression on induced emotions. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the ratings of}} financial market participants {{as one of the}} indicators of financial stability. Particular attention is paid to the sector of banks and insurance corporations in the Czech Republic. Besides discussing the ratings of individual financial institutions, the article explores aggregate ratings. For the banking sector, Fitch's Bank Systemic Risk Matrix is used as an aggregate rating for assessing a country's financial stability. For the insurance sector, the article presents {{for the first time the}} results of a newly constructed aggregate rating for insurers in the Czech Republic, which performs an analogous role to the matrix mentioned above. The analyses conducted in the article confirm that the banking and insurance sectors are showing satisfactory and steadily improving performance from the ratings perspective, in line with the conclusions of previous analyses of a different type. An analysis of the correlations of <b>rating</b> <b>types</b> and of the correlations between the ratings of banks and those of their owners demonstrated that the individual types of ratings of the various agencies are not fully interchangeable and that there is a positive correlation between the average long-term ratings of banks and those of their owners...|$|E

40|$|Although {{the quality}} of rating markets has been academically debated for various types of product and credit ratings {{this is not the}} case for {{insurance}} product ratings. This article provides the first empirical investigation of {{the quality of}} insurance product ratings with an emphasis on the potential sources of bias that undermine the credibility of ratings. Rating certificates for certain insurance products (e. g., life and disability insurance) were established in the German insurance market after deregulation in 1994. These ratings play a potentially important role by increasing customer awareness of differential product quality, thereby encouraging more optimal insurance purchases. However, their capacity for enhancing market transparency and improving consumer protection depends critically on whether they are credible. In this paper, we consider potential conflicts of interest and other common agency problems that might lead to systematic bias and imprecision in ratings. Using prior analysis of other <b>rating</b> <b>types</b> as a guide, we test a series of hypotheses regarding factors that may explain the variation in rating outcomes over time and across rating agencies. The empirical analysis employs a unique panel-data set containing rating data for disability insurance products over a fifteen year period. The product ratings from two rating agencies are combined with additional financial data on the supplying insurance companies. Our initial results suggest that the market structure and governance of the German market avert major concerns regarding the credibility of insurance product ratings. 2 1...|$|E

30|$|Each {{field of}} life depends on fluids such as water, milk, juices, blood, glycerin, grease, paints, oils, polymer solutions, etc. and their direct or {{indirect}} motions. For most of these fluids, a linear stress-strain relationship does not exist [1] and the classical Navier–Stokes equation cannot describe their behavior. There are lots of fluid models in literature depending upon their response under different circumstances. Among them, the model that has received more attention is the <b>rate</b> <b>type</b> fluid model. The first <b>rate</b> <b>type</b> model, which is viscoelastic and still utilized generally, was given by Maxwell [2]. Although Maxwell developed this model for air, not for polymeric liquids, his methodology {{can be summed up}} to provide a plethora of models. Rajagopal and Srinivasa [3] developed a comprehensive thermodynamic framework by using the concept of Maxwell’s work, which provides a base for making a class of <b>rate</b> <b>type</b> viscoelastic fluids. In the presence of transverse magnetic field, Nayak [4] studied both the heat and mass flow rate of viscous fluid through a medium which is porous considering both heat source and sink. Shateyi [5] used a numerical approach to study the MHD flow of a Maxwell fluid past a stretching plate in the presence of chemical reaction. Shah et al. [6] analyzed the unsteady flow of a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) second grade fluid over a stretching sheet by using similarity transformations.|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} on samples from a consolidated sandstone reservoir are presented that demonstrate <b>rate</b> <b>type</b> compaction behaviour {{similar to that}} observed on unconsolidated sands and soils. Such <b>rate</b> <b>type</b> behaviour can have large consequences for reservoir compaction, surface subsidence and induced seismicity resulting from oil and gas production. During traditional single loading rate laboratory experiments, the effect of loading rate on uniaxial compressibility can be ignored to first approximation. In contrast, strongly non-linear compaction occurs when stepwise increases or decreases in loading rate are applied within a loading cycle, during loading after creep or during loading after partial unloading. A {{modified version of the}} RTCM <b>rate</b> <b>type</b> compaction model, built on Dieterich’s rate and state friction equation describes the experimental results well. The new isotach version solves a number of limitations of the original model at the cost of an additional parameter that specifies the split between direct (elastic) and secular (creep) strain. The good fits between the updated model and the experimental data suggest that rate and state friction - e. g. on sliding contact surfaces between assemblies of cemented grains or on sliding micro-cracks - causes the observed non-linear compaction. The same rate and state friction phenomena have been linked to the non-linear rate-dependent earthquake generation in volcanism-induced seismicity, suggesting similar rate dependence for the induced seismicity in depleting oil and gas field...|$|R
