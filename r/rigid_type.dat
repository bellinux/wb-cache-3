60|$|I do {{not mean}} either to say, as some do, that the French mind has {{very little of the}} {{religious}} element. The very sweetest and softest, as well as the most austere and <b>rigid</b> <b>type</b> of piety has been given by the French mind; witness Fénélon and John Calvin--Fénélon standing as the type of the mystic, and Calvin of the rationalistic style of religion. Fénélon, with his heart so sweet, so childlike, so simple and tender, was yet essentially French in his nature, and represented one part of French mind; and what English devotional writer is at all like him? John Newton had his simplicity and lovingness, but wanted that element of gracefulness and classic sweetness which gave so high a tone to the writings of Fénélon. As to Calvin, his crystalline clearness of mind, his calm, cold logic, his severe vehemence are French, also. To this day, a French system of theology is the strongest and most coercive over the strongest of countries--Scotland and America; and yet shallow thinkers flippantly say the French are incapable of religious ideas.|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} {{properties and}} {{construct validity of}} the two-factor 11 -item Circadian Type Inventory (CTI) was examined in a working sample comprising shiftworkers and day workers. The two factors explained 50. 04 % of the variance (LV = 20. 24 % and FR = 29. 80 %). Inter-item correlations were all significant and the item-total correlations suggested the weakness of one item in the LV scale. Cronbach s alpha was 0. 72 (LV) and 0. 79 (FR). Confirmatory factor analysis however provided marginal support for the posited structure. Vigorous types were significantly more alert than languid types across the day and suggested they are less influenced by sleep inertia on waking. Vigorous types also reported needing significantly less sleep. Significant differences in alertness between flexible and <b>rigid</b> <b>types</b> were found between 16 : 00 and 22 : 00 and suggested flexible types are less influenced by circadian and wakefulness factors during these periods. Flexible types also reported significantly less sleep need compared to <b>rigid</b> <b>types.</b> The findings suggested vigorous and flexible types would best cope with shiftwork. It is concluded that the CTI demonstrated good reliability and validity in a working sample. Recommendations for future studies are made...|$|R

Three and/or five ton steel weights were freely dropped onto {{the center of each}} PC rock-shed with 90 cm thick sand cushion, in which the maximum falling height was 30 m. The results obtained from this study are as follows: 1) behaviors of the main girders in two-hinged and inverted L-shaped PC rock-sheds have similarity to those simply supported beam; 2) dynamic behaviors of <b>rigid</b> frame <b>type</b> of PC rock-shed have similarity to those of a rigid portal frame; 3) <b>rigid</b> frame <b>type</b> of PC rock- sheds may provide 1. 7 times bigger safety margin than the two-hinged and inverted L-shaped type ones...|$|R

Apparently he made no difficulty about carrying out the earlier reforms of Edward VI, and he accepted the first book of common prayer after it had been modified by the House of Lords in a Catholic direction.|$|E
40|$|Current {{research}} in interaction aims at defining {{new types of}} multimedia and multimodal experience, at enriching everyday objects and environments {{with the ability to}} capture user actions and intentions, and at integrating real and virtual sources of information, typically exploiting the visual channel. These forms of interaction usually require dedicated architectures, often relying on different component models, and with <b>rigid</b> <b>types</b> of configuration. We present an approach to the integration of real and virtual world sensors and effectors, and of traditional multimedia environments within a single component-based architecture.

5000|$|Because of {{the rigid}} bar {{in this type}} of handcuffs, these tend to occupy more space on a belt whereas the chain link could be folded; the <b>rigid</b> <b>type</b> {{decreases}} the number of possible wearing positions. Typically, the cuffs are worn in a specially designed holster at a 45° angle, on either the left or right side of the officer, depending on whether they are left- or right-handed. These types of handcuffs are known as speedcuffs or quickcuffs, as the rigid bar design allows the officer to easily control the suspect and a much quicker placement on the wrist of the offender. Rigid handcuffs are most popular in the UK.|$|E

Until after World War II it was customary in most navies to wear a removable white cover over the dark blue cap in tropical or summer conditions only. This has been retained but as the cap is now generally a formal or dress item the white cover is worn all year around. The German Navy version of the sailor cap has a raised front in contrast to the flat top favored by the Royal Navy.|$|E
50|$|Rosenberg {{stated that}} the primary German {{objective}} in the region was to attain unlimited access to the oil supplies of Maikop and Groznyi. While Hitler agreed with this assessment, he rejected the proposals {{for the establishment of}} a loosely controlled confederacy in the Caucasus. Instead he believed that the region, with its history of mutually warring states and peoples would have to be subjected to a very <b>rigid</b> <b>type</b> of control. While determining that the Caucasus had to be severed from Russia in any scenario, he did not however decide or had any established notions whether the Caucasus would have to be annexed to Germany or not, nor what form the German administration should ultimately take. Proposals pertaining to autonomy for the Caucasus nationalities were better received from the army than from Rosenberg, to which Hitler only demanded that specific promises of national independence be deleted from any official army proclamations so as not to make any binding promises. At the request of the army, Hitler authorized the German forces to give individual ethnic groups of the Caucasus measure of self-administration still short of national independence in a Führer order dated 8 September 1942, as Rosenberg had also proposed. The troops were instructed to treat the native people as friends, and forced labour was only to be recruited from Russians and Ukrainians.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMobile Learning Games (MLGs) show great {{potential}} for education, especially in fields that deal with outdoor learning activities such as archaeology or botany. However, the number of MLGs currently used remains insignificant. This {{is partly due to}} the fact that the current authoring tools are based on modeling languages that only allow creating very specific and <b>rigid</b> <b>types</b> of MLGs. In this paper, we therefore propose an extensive modeling language for MLGs. This model was designed, with the help of botanical experts, in order to cover the variety of MLG types they would like for their field trips. This modeling language uses high-level concepts, such as game activities and points of interest on a map that can therefore be used by teachers in any domain. Finally, we discuss how scenarios, described with this language, can be automatically transformed into executable web applications...|$|R
