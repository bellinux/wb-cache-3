40|$|We examine several <b>retro-reflecting</b> <b>optical</b> elements, each {{involving}} two reflections. In {{the case}} of a hollow metallic cone having an apex angle of 90, a circularly-polarized incident beam acquires, upon reflection, the opposite spin angular momentum. However, no angular momentum is transferred to the cone, because the reflected beam picks up an orbital angular momentum that is twice as large but opposite in direction to that of its spin. A 90 cone made of a transparent material in which the incident light suffers two total internal reflections before returning, may be designed to endow the retro-reflected beam with different mixtures of orbital and spin angular momenta. Under no circumstances, however, is it possible to transfer angular momentum from the light beam to the cone without either allowing absorption or breaking the axial symmetry of the cone. A simple example of broken symmetry is provided by a wedge-shaped metallic reflector having an apex angle of 90, which picks up angular momentum upon reflecting a circularly-polarized incident beam.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the question of}} an <b>optical</b> <b>unit</b> designing for transmitting power laser radiation through an optical fiber. The aim of this work is designing a simple construction unit with minimized reflection losses. The source of radiation in the <b>optical</b> <b>unit</b> described below is an ultraviolet laser with diode pumping. We present the general functioning scheme and designing features for the three main parts: laser beam deflecting system, laser beam dump and <b>optical</b> <b>unit</b> control system. The described laser beam deflection system is composed of a moving flat mirror and a spherical scattering mirror. Comparative analysis of the production technology for such mirrors was carried out, and, as a result, {{the decision was made}} to produce both mirrors of 99. 99 % pure molybdenum without coating. A moving mirror deflects laser emission from a source through a fiber or deflects it on a spherical mirror and into the laser beam dump, moreover, switching from one position to another occurs almost immediately. It is shown that a scattering mirror is necessary, otherwise, the absorbing surface of the beam dump is being worn out irregularly. The laser beam dump is an open conical cavity, in which the conical element with its spire turned to the emission source is placed. Special microgeometry of the internal surface of the beam dump is suggested for the better absorption effect. An <b>optical</b> <b>unit</b> control system consists of a laser beam deflection system, laser temperature sensor, deflection system solenoid temperature sensor, and deflection mirror position sensor. The signal processing algorithm for signals coming from the sensors to the controller is described. The <b>optical</b> <b>unit</b> will be used in special technological equipment...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} model for the Global Quantum Efficiency (GQE) of the MicroBooNE <b>optical</b> <b>units.</b> An <b>optical</b> <b>unit</b> {{consists}} of a flat, circular acrylic plate, coated with tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB), positioned near the photocathode of a 20. 2 -cm diameter photomultiplier tube. The plate converts the ultra-violet scintillation photons from liquid argon into visible-spectrum photons to which the cryogenic phototubes are sensitive. The GQE is the convolution of the efficiency of the plates that convert the 128 nm scintillation light from liquid argon to visible light, the efficiency of the shifted light to reach the photocathode, and the efficiency of the cryogenic photomultiplier tube. We develop a GEANT 4 -based model of the <b>optical</b> <b>unit,</b> based on first principles, and obtain the range of probable values for the expected number of detected photoelectrons (N_ PE) given the known systematic errors on the simulation parameters. We compare results from four measurements of the N_ PE determined using alpha-particle sources placed at two distances from a TPB-coated plate in a liquid argon cryostat test stand. We also directly measured the radial dependence of the quantum efficiency, and find that this is the same shape as predicted by our model, a Gaussian. Our model results in a GQE of 0. 0055 ± 0. 0009 for the MicroBooNE <b>optical</b> <b>units.</b> While the information shown here is MicroBooNE specific, the approach to the model and the collection of simulation parameters will be widely applicable to many liquid-argon-based light collection systems.

40|$|Today, {{the demand}} for {{high-speed}} data communication and mobile communication has exploded. Thus, {{there is a growing}} need for optical communication systems that convert large volumes of data to optical signals and that accommodate and transmit the signals across long distances.

However, the digital <b>optical</b> <b>units</b> that are currently commercialized or being developed transmit data without compression. Thus, digital optical communication using these units is restricted by the quantity of optical frames when adding diversity or operating with various combinations of CDMA, WCDMA, WiBro, GSM, LTE, and other mobile communication technologies.

40|$|AbstractThe lateral eyes of Crustacea and Insecta {{consist of}} many single <b>optical</b> <b>units,</b> the ommatidia, that are {{composed}} of a small, strictly determined and evolutionarily conserved set of cells. In contrast, the eyes of Myriapoda (millipedes and centipedes) are fields of <b>optical</b> <b>units,</b> the lateral ocelli, {{each of which is}} composed of up to several hundreds of cells. For many years these striking differences between the lateral eyes of Crustacea/Insecta versus Myriapoda have puzzled evolutionary biologists, as the Myriapoda are traditionally considered to be closely related to the Insecta. The prevailing hypothesis to explain this paradox has been that the myriapod fields of lateral ocelli derive from insect compound eyes by disintegration of the latter into single ommatidia and subsequent fusion of several ommatidia to form multicellular ocelli. To provide a fresh view on this problem, we counted and mapped the arrangement of ocelli during postembryonic development of a diplopod. Furthermore, the arrangement of proliferating cells in the eyes of another diplopod and two chilopods was monitored by labelling with the mitosis marker bromodeoxyuridine. Our results confirm that during eye growth in Myriapoda new elements are added {{to the side of the}} eye field, which extend the rows of earlier-generated <b>optical</b> <b>units.</b> This pattern closely resembles that in horseshoe crabs (Chelicerata) and Trilobita. We conclude that the trilobite, xiphosuran, diplopod and chilopod mechanism of eye growth represents the ancestral euarthropod mode of visual-system formation, which raises the possibility that the eyes of Diplopoda and Chilopoda may not be secondarily reconstructed insect eyes...|$|R
