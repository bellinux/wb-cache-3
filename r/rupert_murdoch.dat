5|$|Under her editorship, the {{magazine}} renewed {{its focus on}} fashion {{and returned to the}} prominence it had held under Vreeland. Vogue held its position as market leader against three contenders: Elle; Harper's Bazaar, which had lured away Liz Tilberis, Wintour's most prominent deputy, and Mirabella, a magazine <b>Rupert</b> <b>Murdoch</b> created for Wintour's fired predecessor. Her most serious competitor was within the company: Tina Brown, editor of Vanity Fair and later The New Yorker.|$|E
5|$|In April 1963, Media Securities, {{owned by}} <b>Rupert</b> <b>Murdoch,</b> {{acquired}} a controlling {{interest in the}} station (his second television station after NWS-9 Adelaide) and soon appointed a new general manager, Bill Lean. Both TCN-9 and ATN-7 began purchasing several hours of first-run American television programming from WIN-4, following contractual arrangements signed by Murdoch. Throughout this period WIN-4 expanded its repeater transmissions to include Moruya, Batemans Bay, Narooma, Bega and Eden. Local programming and the station's near-monopoly in the area meant that by 1973, viewership had increased to occupy 63 percent of the audience.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rupert</b> <b>Murdoch</b> {{announced}} in early February 2007 that Baron Cohen had {{signed on to}} do another Borat film with Fox. However, this was contradicted by an interview with Baron Cohen himself in which Baron Cohen stated that Borat was to be discontinued, as he was now too well known to avoid detection {{as he did in}} the film and on Da Ali G Show. A spokesman for Fox later stated that it was too early to begin planning such a film, although they were open to the idea.|$|E

5|$|When {{attending}} a Fox Broadcasting Company publicity event in New York City with <b>Rupert</b> <b>Murdoch,</b> show producer Matt Groening {{was introduced by}} Murdoch to Rickles. Rickles began shouting at Groening, accusing him of spying on his Las Vegas act and using material from that for the episode. The cast actually had been receiving recordings from Rickles from the 1950s to use as {{ideas on how to}} get the style for his animatic portrayal. Another side story the writers produced was for Homer to become an outstanding barber and hair dresser, but this was never used.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick's love {{of music}} led him to serve for twenty years as {{chairman}} of the council of Hymns Ancient & Modern Ltd. During this time the company expanded its scope. From producing the hymnbooks Hymns Ancient and Modern (A), and The English Hymnal, it also took ownership of Canterbury Press, SCM Press, and the Church Times, leading to jokes that Chadwick was an ecclesiastical <b>Rupert</b> <b>Murdoch.</b> He was heavily involved in the editorial process leading to the supplements to A, 100 Hymns for Today, More Hymns for Today, Worship Songs Ancient and Modern, and Hymns Ancient and Modern New Standard, which combined the best of the original book with that from the supplements into a single volume, and also the most recent revision, Common Praise. He had particularly argued for the inclusion of the Spiritual, Steal Away, and this was amongst the music used at his funeral.|$|E

5|$|Homer, Bart and {{the group}} arrive at Miami's Pro Player Stadium for pre-game festivities, but the ticket agent reveals the tickets Wally had bought were counterfeit. Attempting to sneak into the stadium, the group is locked up in the {{detention}} center and vents their frustration on Homer. They are freed when Kogen's friend Dolly Parton uses her extra-strength makeup remover to dissolve the lock on the door. They run into a skybox suite and get {{a view of the}} game until the owner <b>Rupert</b> <b>Murdoch</b> arrives and confronts them. Homer's posse flee to the field, chased by Murdoch's security, until they get lost in the sea of victorious players.

5|$|In 1986 News International owner <b>Rupert</b> <b>Murdoch</b> caused {{controversy}} when {{he moved}} publication of The Times and The Sun away from Fleet Street to new premises in Wapping, East London. Murdoch believed {{it was impossible to}} produce a newspaper profitably on Fleet Street {{and the power of the}} print unions, the National Graphical Association (NGA) and the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades (SOGAT), was too strong (an opinion endorsed by the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher). All Fleet Street print staff were sacked and new staff from the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union were brought in to operate the presses at Wapping using modern computer-operated technology, rendering the power of the old unions obsolete. The resulting Wapping dispute featured violent protests at Fleet Street and Wapping that lasted over a year, but ultimately other publishers followed suit and moved out of Fleet Street towards Canary Wharf or Southwark. Reuters was the last major news outlet to leave Fleet Street in 2005. The same year, The Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph announced they were returning to the centre of London from Canary Wharf to new premises in Victoria in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The Sunday Times is a British {{national}} broadsheet newspaper, the Sunday sister {{paper of}} The Times. In 1968, under {{the ownership of}} Lord Thomson, The Sunday Times {{had been involved in}} a deal to purchase the Mussolini diaries for an agreed final purchase price of £250,000, although they had only paid out an initial amount of £60,000. These turned out to be forgeries undertaken by an Italian mother and daughter, Amalia and Rosa Panvini. In 1981 <b>Rupert</b> <b>Murdoch,</b> who owned several other papers in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, purchased Times Newspapers Ltd, which owned both The Times and its Sunday sister. Murdoch appointed Frank Giles to be the editor of The Sunday Times. The historian Hugh Trevor-Roper became an independent national director of The Times in 1974. Trevor-Roper—who was created Baron Dacre of Glanton in 1979—was a specialist on Nazi Germany, who had worked for the British Intelligence Services during and after the Second World War. At the war's end he had undertaken an official investigation of Hitler's death, interviewing eyewitnesses to the Führer's last movements. In addition to the official report he filed, Trevor-Roper also published The Last Days of Hitler (1947) on the subject. He subsequently wrote about the Nazis in Hitler's War Directives (1964) and Hitler's Place in History (1965).|$|E
