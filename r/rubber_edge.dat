50|$|Snow pushers can {{be divided}} into two {{separate}} families: steel trip edge and fixed <b>rubber</b> <b>edge.</b> Both are used in the same fashion to move snow. <b>Rubber</b> <b>edge</b> snow pushers have a composite material mounted {{on the bottom of the}} moldboard which lies flush to the ground and keeps snow from passing under the pusher, getting a cleaner push than otherwise. Rubber edges are able to flex and pass over obstructions under most conditions. Steel trip edge snow pushers have a spring-loaded steel cutting edge mounted to the bottom of the moldboard that allow them to scrape the pavement. They employ a tripping system to allow them to pass over obstructions such as uneven pavement or raised manhole covers. There are three types of trip edges in use today: compression spring, torsion spring, and composite material springs. Both compression and torsion spring systems work similarly; the steel edge is mounted on a hinge and is held in place by the pressure of the springs; when the edge meets an obstruction the springs compress and allow the edge to flip back and under the pusher and to pass over the obstruction. Composite material trip edges can act like a rubber band when the edge meets an obstruction allowing the steel edge to flip under the pusher and then snap back into place.|$|E
5000|$|During certain {{conditions}} where snow {{may tend to}} freeze to the ground, a steel edge may tend to clean better than rubber; however, during wet snowfalls a <b>rubber</b> <b>edge</b> will [...] "squeegee" [...] the pavement, leaving it much cleaner than a steel edge can. Also, rubber edges generally contour the ground much more effectively than steel because they flex over humps and into dips. One advantage of steel edges is the reduced drag they create. Rubber edges tend {{to act like a}} brake, taking much more power to push than a steel edge when scraping down to bare pavement. Both edges have their advantages and disadvantages, and while some companies have found ways to better contour pavement with a steel edge, their moving components may make them more fragile than continuously welded plows with rubber edges.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{compares the}} effect of three types of rollers (<b>rubber,</b> <b>edged</b> and smooth) upon {{sprouting}} of three sorts of buckwheat seed (‘Darja’, ‘Bamby’ and ‘Gorenjka’). Rolling {{is a very important}} soil cultivation measure after sowing of small seed such as the buckwheat seed, particularly, during the time of drought when the test was performed. Design/methodology/approach: A field test was carried out on divided lots of land in a random block. Sowing and rolling were performed on 6 June 2003. During that period there was an extreme drought causing lack of humidity in the ground. The plants were counted on the 10 and 12 July, i. e., on the fourth and sixth day after sowing. There were most sprouting plants in case of rubber rollers, followed by smooth and edged rollers. Findings: The least plants sprouted on the non-rolled lots of land. The sort had a statistically characteristic effect on the share of plants sprouting during the fourth and sixth day after sowing. Research limitations/implications: The research was carried out only with three types of rollers and three sorts of buckwheat seed. Practical implications: The sort ‘Gorenjka’ had most sprouting plants, followed by the sort ‘Bamby’ and the sort ‘Darja’ with least sprouting plants. Originality/value: In our researches it was proved that the most favourable combination is the rubber roller and the sort ‘Gorenjka’...|$|R

50|$|Snow pusher designs vary {{across the}} industry. They are {{typically}} between 3 ft m and 5.5 ft m high and range from 6 ft m to 40 ft m wide. Snow pushers are typically mounted on wheel loaders, skid steers, or backhoes. For wheel loaders and backhoes, they are mounted using a universal mounting system {{that consists of}} a set of posts (or plates) between which the machine bucket is placed. Chains are attached to the snow pusher and the bucket and tightened using a chain binder. This system allows for snow pushers to be mounted on any machine without regard for brand-specific mounting brackets. Skid steer loaders can use the universal mounting system; however, most manufacturers typically offer skid steer snow pushers with a universally accepted quick-attach system. Though the snow pusher might seem like a simple product, there are many variations across the industry in areas such as moldboard height and angle, sidewall support system (post, wedge, or unsupported), trip edge system, shoe thickness, and <b>rubber</b> cutting <b>edge</b> quality, to name a few.|$|R

40|$|Qualification of the {{full-scale}} {{process and}} design changes for elimination of redesigned solid rocket motor tang nitrile butadiene <b>rubber</b> insulation <b>edge</b> separations and voids was performed from 24 March to 3 December 1990. The objectives of this test were: to qualify design and process changes on flight hardware using a tie ply between the redesigned solid rocket motor steel {{case and the}} nitrile butadiene rubber insulation over the tang capture features; to qualify the use of methyl ethyl ketone in the tang flap region to reduce voids; and to determine if holes in the separator film reduce voids in the tang flap region. The tie ply is intended to aid insulation flow during the insulation cure process, and thus reduce or eliminate edge unbonds. Methyl ethyl ketone is intended to reduce voids in the tang flap area by providing better tacking characteristics. The perforated film was intended to provide possible vertical breathe paths to reduce voids in the tang area. Tang tie ply testing consisted of 270 deg of the tang circumference using a new layup method and 90 deg of the tang circumference using the current layup methods. Tie ply process success {{was defined as a}} reduction of insulation unbonds. Lack of any insulation edge unbonds on the tang area where the new process was used, and the presence of 17 unbonds with the current process, proves the test to be a success. Successful completion of this test has qualified the new processes...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the fatigue}} life of {{pneumatic}} tires is investigated with particular {{focus on the}} phenomenon of belt separation. This phenomenon yields the propagation of fatigue cracks in the rubber separating the belts; not {{the separation of the}} rubber at the interfaces with the belts. Cracks at the belts edges are related among others to the high stress concentration due to the very different stiffness of the two mate- rials. A steady-state rolling ﬁnite element model of the full tire is used to evaluate the stress and strain ﬁelds in the <b>rubber</b> at the <b>edges</b> of the belts. Suitable life predictors are deﬁned and computed for the identiﬁcation of the zones with a higher expectation of failure. For the evaluation of crack propagation in the bulk rubber material between different belts, in principle, two different approaches are employed associated with crack nucleation and crack growth. The two approaches are applied to the study of crack propagation in a truck tire and the results of different pre- dictors are compared to crack propagation found in a real tire...|$|R
50|$|In a {{quest to}} gain {{eligibility}} for the 2016 Summer Olympics Williams began her clay season in Brindisi in a Fed Cup World Group Play-off tie against Italy. The American was nominated to play Camila Giorgi in her first <b>rubber</b> and <b>edged</b> out the first set in a tiebreak. Williams broke serve {{for the first time}} in the fourth game and wrapped up the match with a second break as the Italian was serving to stay in the match. The tie was locked at 1-1 at the end of day 1 after Williams' teammate Lauren Davis managed to win only three games in her rubber. Williams played Italian No. 1 Sara Errani in her second single rubber and lost just her second set in eight meetings against the Italian. The American's fluctuating level saw her go from a break up to a break down with the Italian serving for the match. The American broke serve and won the set in a tiebreak to level the match. Williams took the third set and ended the match with 70 winners to Errani's 7. With this win team USA led 2-1 and needed one more point to advance back into the World Group. The tie was forced in to a deciding doubles rubber when Christina McHale managed just two games in her loss to Brindisi-born Flavia Pennetta. Williams teamed up with Alison Riske, marking the first time she had played doubles with anyone other than her sister Venus in 13 years, to take on Eranni and Pennetta. The Italian pairing handed Williams her first Fed Cup loss en route to winning the final rubber and clinching the tie 3-2. USA were relegated to World Group II.|$|R
40|$|A flap {{actuation}} system, the Controllable <b>Rubber</b> Trailing <b>Edge</b> Flap (CRTEF), for {{distributed load}} control on a wind turbine blade {{had been developed}} in the period from 2006 to 2013 at DTU. The purpose of the project is to optimize the structural design of the flexible part of the CRTEF based on a realistic blade section geometry {{in order to meet}} the objectives and the constraints of the project. The objectives include the deflection requirements and the energy efficiency, while the constraints include the bending stiffness of the structure, the local shape deformations, critical material strength, and manufacturing limitations. With the inspiration from the literature review, an arch model with arches forming concave on the flap surface and enclosing the voids to be pressurized is supposed to result in the bending movement of the flap when pressure is applied on the voids to straighten the arches. The model was designed using SolidWorks for the parameterization of the design and ANSYS Workbench for the static structural Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations. The built-in parametric optimizer of ANSYS Workbench, Direct Optimization of Design Exploration, was used to optimize the design with the parameters of the geometry. The surface pressure loads during operation of the turbine with the flap installed were evaluated with XFOIL and included in the simulations. The model was developed first by qualitative analyses to have a reasonable preliminary design, and then by parametric optimization to have the final design. The parameterization of the design was improved on the way of optimizations, in order to expand the design space to solve the problem of stress concentration, so that it covers the design with the acceptable material safety factor. With the consideration of surface pressure loads during operation of the turbine, the optimum design fulfills the requirements for flap angle of 15 degrees and - 15 degrees with the actuation pressure of 0. 428 MPa and 0. 386 MPa, and the material safety factor of 1. 58 and 1. 71, respectively. The design also meets the objective for energy efficiency by the lower actuation pressure than in the previous project and by the small volume of the voids. Besides, the constraint of the bending stiffness is fulfilled with the deflection of less than the flap angle of ± 5 degrees when the turbine is operating without the actuation pressure, and the constraints of the local shape deformations and manufacturing limitations are also fulfilled. With the results of the thesis, the model could be manufactured and tested first in the laboratory and then on the wind turbine. In conclusion, the results of the thesis contribute a robust design in the area of smart rotor with significantly better effect and efficiency.
