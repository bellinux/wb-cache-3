40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that {{subjective}} well-being (SWB) of the individual depends on two types of variables.

Recently considerable {{effort has been}} directed towards the development of high density magneto-resistive memories. This research includes work in many areas such as obtaining cells with higher signal levels, densification of storage cells {{and the development of}} an appropriate sensing scheme. This dissertation deals with the development of latter stages of a multi stage sensing scheme for a large magneto-resistive memory. In this sensing scheme the signal of a actual element is compared against the signal from a dummy element. The resulting signal is stored and again is compared against a signal of opposite polarity which is generated from the same element. This process is called self referencing and is done to minimize offset problems. The special features of this sensing scheme are: the balanced sensing where the signal from the actual and the dummy elements are balanced to have identical time constants, a two stage switched capacitor auto-zero scheme where the DC offsets between the two elements due to mismatch is removed while generating very little noise and self referencing which is done by a sample and compare circuit.

40|$|The present project {{examined}} the regulatory function of social referencing in two neurodevelopmental disorders {{that have been}} well defined genetically and are characterized by differing patterns of socio-cognitive development: Down syndrome (DS) and Williams syndrome (WS). In addition, since the social <b>referencing</b> <b>process</b> requires children to coordinate three fundamental abilities (initiation of joint attention, gaze following, emotional responsivity), the present project also included three follow-up studies which {{examined the}}se abilities separately. Participants were 21 children with DS (M age = 4. 97 years; SD =. 74) and 21 children with WS (M age = 4. 92 years; SD =. 76) closely matched on age and gender. The results of the Social Referencing task indicated {{that the majority of}} children in both diagnostic groups formed positive opinions about the ambiguous stimulus when the adult communicated a joyful nonverbal message but had difficulty using the adult 2 ̆ 7 s expression of fear to regulate their behavior in response to the ambiguous stimulus. Children with DS were more likely than were children with WS to shift gaze between the adult and the ambiguous stimulus. However, the children with DS frequently formed a positive opinion of the fearful stimulus and were more likely than were the children with WS to touch the stimulus. When the adult reacted fearfully to the ambiguous stimulus, the longest look directed to her by children with WS was significantly longer than the longest look directed by children with DS. In addition, children with WS were less likely to form an opinion of the fearful stimulus and more likely than children with DS to resort to superficially imitating the adult 2 ̆ 7 s display as opposed to using the adult 2 ̆ 7 s opinion of the stimulus to form their own. The results of the follow-up studies demonstrated that children with DS were more likely than were children with WS to initiate joint attention with the adult and to respond to joint attention in triadic situations. In addition, in a situation with a reduced attentional demand on the child than that used in the Social Referencing task, results indicated that the majority of children in both groups formed a positive opinion of the stimulus when the adult communicated a joyful message about it. However, when the adult communicated a fearful message, only one child in each group formed a negative opinion of the stimulus. In summary, the results indicate that there are both similarities and differences in the problems encountered by children with DS and children with WS in the social <b>referencing</b> <b>process.</b> Both groups had difficulty interpreting the communicative significance of fearful reactions. However, children with DS were more successful than children with WS both at coordinating attention in triadic interactions and at identifying the source of the adult 2 ̆ 7 s interest.

40|$|AbstractSystematic and {{network-wide}} {{estimation of}} traffic quality {{is an essential}} requirement for a traffic management. Collecting traffic information based on conventional sensor techniques becomes an economical challenge when road authorities are faced with wide-area road networks. With respect to nowadays strictly limited resources, the cost-efficient analysis of historical driving speeds based on mass floating car data (FCD) is {{getting more and more}} important in modern traffic management. The representative calculation of typical driving speed for identical weekdays over a certain period allows the ex post identification of periodic bottlenecks and could be also used to evaluate the effects of management strategies. Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} present a four stage semi-automatic method for a network-wide level of service estimation based on processing historical FCD. During the first and the second chapter the paper gives a summary over related work in this research field and introduces the used floating car data source as well as the applied digital roadmap based on OpenStreetMap. During the first stage, the developed method establishes an easy to use <b>referencing</b> <b>process</b> between the digital road network and the traffic message channel system (TMC). Based on the road network separation with respect to the TMC-system, the second stage employs a FCD matching algorithm, which allows the detection of driving direction especially for low-frequency floating car data and small TMC-segments. The third stage of the method deals with the systematic and statistical analysis of historical driving speeds. Therefore, the paper analyzes the statistical significance level of derived average driving speeds over two hour time intervals for typical weekdays. The fourth stage of the method describes a self-calibrating level of service calculation process which uses speed indices. Finally, the paper exemplifies results of the developed method for the road network of Hanover (Germany) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} how softcopy digital photogrammetry can be used to describe and monitor shorebird habitat. I focused on applying monitoring methods previously used for beach erosions studies of tourist beaches to shorebird habitat concentrating on the habitat requirements of Western Snowy Plovers. I investigated how the physical habitat of Western Snowy Plovers has changed over time at Sand Beach, which is part of Coal Oil Point Reserve in Santa Barbara, California, from 1928 to the present day, using width, area, and elevation data gathered from a series of aerial photographs. For two-dimensional analysis, I used single georeferenced photographs to measure width at regular intervals and area for each year a photo was available. Next, for three-dimensional analysis, I employed digital elevation models (DEMs) built from stereo photographs to explore whether the available photos can be used to document changes in the elevation of Sands Beach. The results were mixed. Georeferenced aerial photographs can be used to obtain quality measurements of beach area and width. Orthorectification is not necessary if photos can be georeferenced with minimal error. The amount of error present in the georeferenced images was indicated by the root mean squared error. A higher root mean squared error in the <b>referencing</b> <b>process</b> resulted in lower accuracy. Given the available photos and ground control points, I was unable to build digital elevation models with high enough quality to compare elevation from one year to the next. This was more likely due to a need for more ground control points than to the image scale or image errors. The area of Sands Beach was found to be increasing in area. This was due mainly to the retreat of the vegetation line as the mouth of Devereux Slough shifted in 1992 rather than an accumulation of sand on the beach...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper shows how work piece measurement data (i. e. reference data) can be put in relation to the machine coordinate system using an automated active alignment system. A complete automation of the procedure appears very promising for a reliable referencing sub micrometric accuracy. This automation process has been estimated to strongly improve present state of the art because the largest influence on the accuracy derives from the manual or semi-automated referencing routines. Compared to state of the art manual work piece referencing where a typical accuracy of about 10 micrometer is obtained, the referencing accuracy could be increased by a factor 100 by the semi-automated <b>referencing</b> <b>process.</b> A complete automation of the procedure appears very promising for a reliable referencing accuracy below 0. 1 micrometer. The essential input raising from this research work increase the possibility of integration into control system of measurement data.

In fact concepts behind the control of the active alignment system (capability of compensating offsets of the pallet and then of the work piece in machine tool) could be extended. The CCD cameras could also be used for the control of the active alignment chuck by permanently measuring the reference mark positions, realizing a closed-loop control during the alignment process and also during machining. This can be done directly retrieving markers positions from CCD cameras and providing them into CNC.

Different NDT technologies like ultrasound, thermography or computer tomography (CT) are currently used for the inspection of FRP. Each of these testing methods has its pros and cons. CT offers detailed 3 D information about the inner structures of the materials, but is quite time-consuming. Ultrasound and thermography are fast testing technologies and therefore could be also used for inline inspection. However they have the disadvantage of less detailed information compared to CT. In order to combine the advantages and overcome the disadvantages, CT is used as reference technology for the inline testing methods. This means that ultrasonic or thermography systems are qualified by the <b>referencing</b> <b>process</b> to detect defects {{so that they can}} deliver reliable inspection results within the production process. For this purpose it is absolutely necessary to easily compare the different kind of NDT methods. This has been achieved by developing a NDT software platform for loading, visualising and analysing ultrasonic, thermographic and CT data. This platform enables the user to analyse data sets of the different technologies in one single software package and to easily compare and also combine the results. For CT data evaluation advanced and adapted algorithms have been developed and integrated in the software platform, which allow automated defect detection and porosity analysis. In addition the fibre orientation can be determined based on a new 3 D texture analysis algorithm. For 2 D evaluation of ultrasound and thermography data advanced and automated defect detection algorithms have been implemented and included into the software platform. As some defects are only visible in one of the two testing technologies, a data fusion algorithm has been developed which combines the two analysis results. Through this procedure extensive failure detection is achieved. The new machine vision platform for NDT has been tested on selected data sets generated from real as well as special test parts. The evaluation results are promising and show clearly the possibilities offered for visualisation, analysis and data fusion for CT, thermography and ultrasound inspection...|$|E
40|$|Urban {{transport}} {{planning aims}} at balancing conflicting challenges by promoting more efficient transport systems while reducing negative impacts. The availability of {{better and more}} reliable data has not only stimulated new planning methodologies, but also created challenges for efficient data management and data integration. The major focus {{of this study is}} to improve methodologies for representing and integrating multi-source and multi-format urban transport data. This research approaches the issue of data integration based on the classification of urban transport data both from a functional and a representational perspective. The functional perspective considers characteristics of the urban transport system and planning requirements, and categorises data into supply, demand, performance and impact. The representational perspective considers transport data in terms of their spatial and non-spatial characteristics that are important for data representation. These two perspectives correspond to institutional and methodological data integration respectively, and are the foundation of transport data integration. This research is based on the city of Wuhan in China. The methodological issues of transport data integration are based on the representational perspective. A framework for data integration has been put forward, in which spatial data are classified as point, linear and areal types, and the non-spatial data are sorted out as values and temporal attributes. This research has respectively probed the integration of point, linear and areal transport data within a GIS environment. The locations of socio-economic activities are point-type data that need to be spatially referenced. A location <b>referencing</b> <b>process</b> requires a referencing base, source address units and referencing methods. The referencing base consists of such spatial features as streets, street addresses, points of interest and publicly known zones. These referencing bases have different levels of spatial preciseness and have to be kept in a hierarchy. Source addresses in Chinese cities are usually written as one sentence, which has to be divided into address units for automatic geo-coding. As it is difficult to separate from the sentences, the address units have to be clearly identified in survey forms. Depending on the types of address units, the <b>referencing</b> <b>process</b> makes use of either semantic name matching or address matching to link source addresses to features in the referencing base. The name-based and road-based referencing schemes constitute a comprehensive location referencing framework that is applicable to Chinese cities. The relationship between two sets of linear features can be identified with spatial overlay in the case of independent representation, or with internal linkage in a dependent representation. The bus line is such a feature that runs on the street network and can be dependently referenced by streets. In the heavily bus-oriented city of Wuhan, bus lines constitute a large public transit network that is important to transport planning and management. This research has extended conventional bus line representation to a more detailed level. Each bus line has been differentiated as two directional routes that are defined separately with reference to the street network. Accordingly, individual route stops are also represented in the database. These stop sites are spatial features with geometry that are linked to street segments and bus routes by linear location referencing methods. A data model linking base street network, bus lines and routes, line and route stops, and other bus operations data has been constructed. The benefits of the detailed model have been demonstrated in several transport applications. Zonal data transitions include three types of operations, i. e. aggregation, areal interpolation and disaggregation. This study focuses on disaggregating data from larger zones to smaller zones. In the context of Wuhan, zonal data disaggregation involves the allocation of statistical data from statistical units to smaller parcels. Given the availability of land use data, a weighted approach reflecting spatial variations has been applied in the disaggregation process. Two technical processes for disaggregation have been examined. Weighted area-weighting (WAW) is an adaptation of the classic area-weighting method, and Monte Carlo simulation (MC) is a stochastic process based on a raster data model. The MC outcome is more convenient for subsequent re-aggregation, and is also directly available for micro-simulation. An important contribution arising from this zonal integration study is that two standardised disaggregation tools have been developed within a GIS environment. The research has also explored the institutional aspect of data integration. The findings of this study show that there is generally a good institutional transport structure in the city of Wuhan and that there is also a growing awareness of using information technology. Professional cooperation exists among transport organisations, but not yet at a level for data sharing. An integrated data support framework requires data sharing. In such a framework, it should be possible to know where to get data for specific transport studies, or which kind of research an institution supports...|$|E

Also, the legal procedures to settle the budget of a local governments are not defined in detail. In consequence, different procedures exist, which lead also to different implementations of procedures in participatory budgeting. In this contribution, process models for (participatory) budgeting are investigated and a <b>reference</b> <b>process</b> model for traditional budget planning and online participatory budgeting is developed. <b>Reference</b> <b>process</b> models support cities and municipalities to assess the added value and to estimate the human and financial resources to execute participatory budgeting. Hence, comprehensive <b>reference</b> <b>process</b> models are helpful instruments for local governments {{to decide whether to}} perform participatory budgeting or not. They are also contributing to successful e-participation endeavors by providing conceptual models (blueprints) for scoping the activities to engage with citizens from the beginning of planning till the evaluation of impact and outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Usually, for a {{particular}} business process different variants exist. Each of them constitutes an adjustment of a <b>reference</b> <b>process</b> model to specific require-ments building the process context. Contemporary process management tools do not adequately support the modeling of such process variants. Either the variants have to be specified as separate process models or they are {{expressed in terms of}} conditional branches within the same process model. Both methods often lead to redundancies making model adaptations a time consuming and error-prone task. In this paper we discuss selected concepts of the Provop approach for modeling and managing process variants. A particular process variant can be configured at a high level of abstraction by applying a set of well-defined change operations to a <b>reference</b> <b>process</b> model. In particular, this paper discusses advanced concepts for the design and modeling of such a <b>reference</b> <b>process</b> model {{as well as for the}} adjustments required to configure the different process variants. Altogether, Provop provides a flexible and powerful solution for process variant management...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{designing}} a Cyber Physical Production System (CPPS), e. g., modern power plants or steel mills, typically {{takes place in}} a multi-disciplinary engineering environment, in which experts from various engineering domains and organizations work together towards creating complex engineering artifacts. The process of designing such complex engineering artifacts requires iterations and redesign phases, which lead to continuous changes of the data and knowledge. To manage changes in such environment, we have previously proposed a generic <b>reference</b> <b>process</b> for conducting Knowledge Change Management and Analysis (KCMA). This paper implements this process for the case study of a modern Hydro Power Plant by adapting the proposed generic <b>reference</b> <b>process</b> into a scientific prototype developed using Semantic Web Technologies. Finally, we conduct an evaluation to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed <b>reference</b> <b>process</b> and the developed prototype. Thus, the contribution of this paper is two-folds: (1) A tool-supported prototype for KCMA of a hydro power plant, and (2) A feasibility evaluation of this prototype that reports feedback and lessons learned for achieving KCMA in real-world case studies. status: publishe...|$|R
