She won a silver medal in the mixed doubles at the 2012 London Olympics playing with Andy Murray, with whom she also reached the 2010 Hopman Cup final. At the 2012 Guangzhou Women's Open, Robson became the first British woman since Jo Durie in 1990 to reach a WTA main-tour final, where she lost to Hsieh Su-wei.

5|$|The {{most heavily}} {{promoted}} feud {{going into the}} event was between Bam Bam Bigelow and Lawrence Taylor. At Royal Rumble 1995, Bigelow teamed with Tatanka in the final <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tournament for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Bigelow was pinned {{at the end of}} the match, which led to the crowd heckling him. He responded by pushing NFL player Lawrence Taylor, who was sitting at ringside. Bigelow refused to apologize and instead challenged Taylor to a wrestling match. Taylor agreed and trained with WWF World Heavyweight Champion Diesel to prepare for the match. The storyline between Bigelow and Taylor brought the WWF much mainstream exposure, as the match was discussed by several news outlets.|$|E
5|$|Robson had direct {{entry to}} the main draw of the 2012 US Open from her WTA ranking, where she {{defeated}} Samantha Crawford in the first round. In the second round she defeated former US Open Champion Kim Clijsters in Clijsters' final singles match before her retirement. Robson consequently reached the third <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Grand Slam tournament {{for the first time}} in her career and joined Serena Williams, Lindsay Davenport, Venus Williams, Amélie Mauresmo and Justine Henin as one of the only six people to beat Clijsters at the US Open championships, and the first player to beat her there since 2003. She followed up her performance with her first victory over a top ten player, beating 9th seed Li Na in the third round in three sets. Robson became the first female British tennis player to reach this stage of a Grand Slam tournament since Samantha Smith reached the fourth round of Wimbledon 14 years previously, but she was defeated by defending champion Stosur, ending her best run at a Grand Slam tournament to date.|$|E

5|$|The chased hare {{will then}} run at around 40–45km/h (24–26mph) {{and the course}} will last around 35–40seconds over 0.5km (0.3 miles). The greyhounds which pursue the hare will, being faster, start {{to catch up with}} it. As greyhounds are much larger than hares but less agile, they find it {{difficult}} to follow the hares' sharp turns which they make to evade the dogs. This agility gives the hare an important and often crucial advantage as it seeks to escape. Under some coursing club rules, the dogs are awarded points on how many times they can turn the hare, and how closely they force the hare's progress. In the UK, the contest between the greyhounds was usually judged from horseback, and the winning greyhound proceeded to the next <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> knock-out tournament. The 2003 UK coursing season ran from 1 October to 28 February.|$|E
5|$|Through the 2016 NBA draft, a Tar Heel {{has been}} chosen first overall two {{times in the}} history of the event, James Worthy in 1982 and Brad Daughtery in 1986. Out of the thirty teams that {{currently}} make up the NBA, seven have not picked a player from North Carolina. The New York Knicks have selected nine former Tar Heels, which is the most of any current NBA franchise. Forty-nine Tar Heels have been drafted in the first round of the NBA Draft, with Tony Bradley, Jr. and Justin Jackson being the latest. The most Tar Heels selected in the first <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single NBA Draft is four, which happened twice, in 2005 and 2012. Sixteen players have been selected to either an ABA or NBA All-Star Game, sixteen have been a member of an NBA or ABA championship winning team, and nine have achieved both. The most Tar Heels selected in a single NBA Draft is five, in 1980. Of all the Tar Heels that have been drafted, five have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{the club}} won their third Portuguese Cup and {{qualified}} for the 1968–69 Cup Winners' Cup. As in previous years, {{they were unable to}} get past the second round, losing 4–1 on aggregate to Slovan Bratislava. Porto's last participation in the Fairs Cup, in 1969–70, also ended in the second round, with a defeat against holders Newcastle United. Domestically, Porto finished the league in an all-time low ninth place, thus failing to qualify for European competition in the 1970–71 season. They returned the following season to participate in the inaugural edition of the UEFA Cup, which officially replaced the Fairs Cup, but their debut against Nantes led to another premature exit. Porto returned to this tournament in four of the following five seasons, the exception being 1973–74, when it failed qualification for European competitions. In the first of those seasons (1972–73), Porto reached the third <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> European competition for the first time, but were eliminated by Dynamo Dresden. They beat Barcelona in the first round, in what was the teams' first European encounter and the only time Porto eliminated the Spanish side from European competitions. In the 1975–76 UEFA Cup, Porto were again eliminated in the third round, but in the process they beat Luxembourg's Avenir Beggen with a club record home (7–0) and aggregate (10–0) win scores. In {{the first round of the}} following season's UEFA Cup, Porto were matched with Schalke 04. After a tie in the first leg, Porto squandered a 2–0 lead in the second leg, conceding three goals in the last 15 minutes, which resulted in their elimination.|$|E
