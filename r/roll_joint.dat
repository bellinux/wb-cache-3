The main {{focus is on the}} modeling of drag and lift forces on the legs of the robot, which comprise the main difference in dynamic characteristics between on-land and underwater robots. Drag and lift forces acting on the underwater link are described {{as a function of the}} relative velocity of the link with respect to the fluid using the strip theory. Using the translational velocity of the link as the rotational velocity of the joint, we describe the drag force as a function of joint variables. Generalized drag torque is successfully derived from the drag force as a function of generalized variables and its first derivative, even though the arm has a <b>roll</b> <b>joint</b> and twist angles between the joints. To verify the proposed model, we conducted drag torque simulations using a simple Selective Compliant Articulated Robot Arm...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} the preliminary experimental validation of a systematic prosthetic control strategy on a custom compliant transfemoral prosthesis {{with the end}} result being energy efficient 3 -dimension (3 D) multi-contact prosthetic walking. In particular, {{with the goal of}} capturing essential components of realistic amputee-prosthesis system, a 3 D asymmetric hybrid system model is presented — this forms the foundation for formal gait design and control construction. Based on this model, a two-step direct collocation optimization method is utilized to design an energy efficient multi-contact prosthetic gait in 3 D. The designed gaits are also subject to various practical constraints such as human-likeness constraints and comfortability constraints. For experimental validation, a 3 D capable powered transfemoral prosthetic device is custom built so as to be amendable to realizing the designed 3 D prosthetic gaits. Differentiating this device from existing powered prosthesis, compliant components are added to the three joints (two pitch joints and one <b>roll</b> <b>joint)</b> for the purpose of energy saving and human-like behaviors. Combining the presented control methodology and the novel hardware design, the end result is experimentally realized 3 D multi-contact prosthetic walking with improved energy efficiency compared to other devices and control methods...|$|E
