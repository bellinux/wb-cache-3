The {{chitosan}} was degraded by {{hydrochloric acid}} {{and the effects}} of concentration of chitosan, amount of hydrochloric acid, reaction temperature and reaction time on the viscosity of chitosan were investigated.

40|$|The {{leather tanning}} {{industry}} {{is characterized by}} the production of different kinds of effluents, generated in each step of leather processing. These effluents have various chemical compounds which may cause toxicity and endocrine disruption and are thus known as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC). Tanning stabilizes the protein structure of the hide and imparts heat stability, enhanced tensile properties, and resistance to microbial degradation. Currently most high quality leather is "chrome-tanned," produced by treatment of the hide with salts of the mineral chromium. In this study, the wastewater characteristics and ecotoxicity before and after tanning and retanning processes using mimosa tannin are assessed. Vegetable leather production procedure was followed using one dose mimosa tannin. Leather quality was evaluated according to standard methods. Wastewater characteristics showed that mimosa contributed high organic content to the wastewater. Although vegetable tannin was used the effluent toxicity was observed in tanning and retanning effluents. The preliminary results also showed that leather quality tests failed or at minimum level to comply with the standard values indicating that there is still a need to optimize the procedure including mimosa dose. This study was designed to produce eco-friendly leather using mimosa in tanning and <b>retanning</b> processes. <b>Leather</b> quality and the ecotoxicity of each process during leather production was assessed according to standard methods. ...|$|R

The formaldehyde content in leathers treated only with resin increases with time while the formaldehyde content in leathers treated additionally with vegetable compounds is reduced. The lower the formaldehyde content in the leather, the higher the ability of vegetable compounds to reduce such content.

The profiles of total phenolic compounds (TPC) and tannins contents in water and dilute alkali {{as a function of}} extraction temperature and time led to the selection of the best conditions concerning extraction yield and selectivity. The selectivity profile for TPC and tannins was established, and a maximum of 20 g per kg of bark was found, representing 2. 5 g per L of extract produced. On the basis of these results, the conditions selected to produce the extract for the application envisaged in this work were: water, 140 degrees C and 120 min. To increase the extract concentration, recirculation of the extracts over fresh bark (similar to a continuous bark extraction process) was performed and evaluated. The increment in phenolic compounds was about 4, attaining the final concentration of 8. 6 g/L for TPC and 6. 5 g/L for tannins.

No presente trabalho, estudou-se a influência da massa molar e da estrutura de polímeros acrílicos em couros, a partir da síntese de poli(ácido acrílico) s monodispersos via ATRP do acrilato de t-butila, seguida de hidrólise com ácido trifluoroacético. A polimerização foi conduzida pelo processo em massa, usando CuBr/PMDETA como sistema catalítico e EBP como iniciador. O desempenho destes polímeros sintetizados e um poli(ácido acrílico) obtido via radicalar (comercial, polidisperso) foi avaliado, nos couros {{wet-blue}} recurtidos, por meio de testes físico-mecânicos, TGA/DSC, grau de distribuição de acrílicos no couro e MEV. Todos os polímeros aumentaram a estabilidade térmica do couro. O polímero parcialmente hidrolisado apresentou a pior ação recurtente quando comparado com o polímero de mesma massa molar, mas totalmente hidrolisado. O poli(acrilato de sódio) com maior massa molar (Mn = 66. 000 g/mol) desenvolveu os piores resultados em propriedades físicas e penetração nas fibras do couro, enquanto que aquele com menor massa molar (Mn = 6. 100 g/mol) resultou nas melhores propriedades de maciez e resistência física. Os testes relativos ao estudo à oferta de polímero ao couro indicaram uma possibilidade de redução de resíduos nos efluentes quando do uso de poliacrilatos monodispersos, se comparado com os polidispersos. Os poliacrilatos de sódio, independentes da massa molar, possuem efeito de complemento ao curtimento ao sal de cromo, sendo que aqueles de massa molar inferior a Mn = 20. 000 g/mol resultaram em valores de temperatura de retração levemente superiores.

Further the poly(t-butyl acrylate) s were hydrolyzed in dichloromethane with trifluoracetic acid.

After this first evaluation, it was selected just the middle region to test them. The performance, of polymers synthesized and also a commercial retanning agent (with broad polidispersity), was evaluated by physical tests, thermal analysis (TGA/DSC), acrylic distribution degree on leather and scanning eletron microscopy. All polymers showed good retanning action, by increasing the leather thermal stability. Partially hydrolyzed polymer resulted in worse retanning action (lower crosslinking) when compared with the polymer with the same molecular weight, but totally hydrolyzed.

40|$|O objetivo do trabalho foi avaliar a resistência do couro de tilápia do Nilo (Oreochromis niloticus L.) curtido com sais de cromo e diferentes técnicas de recurtimento. As peles foram distribuídas em delineamento inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 4 x 2, sendo quatro técnicas de recutimento (T 1 = 4 % de sais de cromo; T 2 = 4 % taninos vegetais; T 3 = 4 % taninos sintéticos e T 4 = 2 % taninos sintéticos e 2 % vegetais) e dois sentidos do couro (S 1 =Longitudinal; S 2 =Transversal), com 6 repetições. Para os testes de determinação da resistência à tração, alongamento e rasgamento progressivo foi utilizado o dinamômetro EMIC, com velocidade de afastamento entre as cargas de 100 ± 20 mm/mm, em ambiente climatizado (± 23 º C e UR do ar de 50 %), por 24 horas (ABNT-NBR 10455, 1988). A técnica de recurtimento influenciou na espessura do couro, sendo que com sais de cromo (T 1 = 0, 61 a 0, 68 mm) a espessura foi {{inferior}} aos demais tratamentos (1, 30 a 1, 53 mm). O sentido do couro não teve influencia sobre a espessura. Os couros recurtidos com sais de cromo apresentaram significativamente valores superiores para tração (30, 31 N/mm 2), alongamento (52, 42 %) e rasgamento progressivo (91, 23 N/mm) comparados aos curtidos com os taninos vegetais, sintéticos ou combinados. O sentido longitudinal do couro apresentou superior tração (23, 00 N/mm 2) comparado ao transversal (12, 03 N/mm 2), porém, não diferiu no teste de alongamento e rasgamento progressivo entre o longitudinal e transversal. Segundo padrões da literatura, o couro curtido ao cromo deve apresentar uma resistência à tração de mínimo de 9, 80 N/mm 2, 60 % para elongação e 14, 70 N/mm para rasgo.

In order to determine the resistance to traction, elongation and gradual tearing were used dynamometer EMIC, with offset speed between 100 loads ± 20 mm/mm, in climatized environment (± 23 º C and UR of the 50 % air), for 24 hours (ABNT-NBR 10455, 1988). The retanning technique influenced the thickness of the leather which became inferior (1. 30 to 1. 53 mm) to other treatments due to the chromium salts (T 1 = 0. 61 to 0. 68 mm). The course of the leather did not influence the thickness.
