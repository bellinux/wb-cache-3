2500|$|In Osborne's 2016 budget he {{introduced}} a sugar tax {{and raised the}} tax-free allowance for income tax to £11,500, as well as lifting the 40% income tax threshold to £45,000. He also gave initial funding for several large infrastructure projects, such as High Speed 3 (an east–west rail line across the north of England), Crossrail 2 (a north–south rail line across London), a road tunnel across the Pennines, and upgrades to the M62 motorway. There {{would also be a}} new [...] "lifetime" [...] Individual Savings Account (ISA) for the under-40s, with the government putting in £1 for every £4 saved. Those saving £4000 towards a house deposit were promised an annual £1000 top-up until they reached 50. £100m was also allocated to tackle <b>rough</b> <b>sleeping.</b> However, many charities complained that they thought Osborne's 2016 budget favoured big business rather than disabled people.|$|E
2500|$|The valleys {{between the}} {{individual}} plateaux [...] were used as drove roads by cattle drovers who built rough protective shelters for their arduous journeys. Even today there are no paved roads over the Speyside–Deeside [...] watershed and the passes are impossible even for four-wheel drives. The Lairig Ghru pass between Speyside and Deeside is about [...] long and reaches its greatest height at Pools of Dee at [...] where the water may be frozen over even in mid summer. This route has a total ascent of about [...] between habitation at Coylumbridge in Speyside and Linn of Dee. At {{about the same time}} that droving was dying out {{towards the end of the}} 19th century, deer stalking estates were flourishing and so the shelters were developed into bothies to provide improved, though still primitive, accommodation for gamekeepers. In modern times these bothies have been taken over by the Mountain Bothies Association for use by trekkers and climbers to provide shelter and <b>rough</b> <b>sleeping</b> accommodation.|$|E
50|$|Considerable {{progress}} has been made in reducing <b>rough</b> <b>sleeping</b> in England with the voluntary sector playing a lead role. Some parts of the voluntary sector have chosen to remain outside the collaborative framework that has been created to achieve the reduction. London continues to have the biggest <b>rough</b> <b>sleeping</b> problem with between 250 and 300 individuals sleeping out on any night and almost 3,000 over a year. Nonetheless, this figure compares favourably with <b>rough</b> <b>sleeping</b> figures for other European capitals and is considerably lower than, for example, New York which has a comparable population to London.|$|E
