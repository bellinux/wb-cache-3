40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a conception}} of research in mathematics education intended to strengthen its contribution {{to the development of}} professional knowledge for mathematics teaching. It examines processes of knowledge creation within the practices of <b>researching</b> <b>and</b> <b>teaching,</b> by considering two projects concerned with the teaching of mathematics in elementary school. The first project illustrates an approach to eliciting and codifying craft knowledge; the second, an approach to contextualising and activating scholarly knowledge. These examples point to a dialogic cycle in which knowledge creation within the practices of <b>researching</b> <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> becomes more co-ordinated, and knowledge conversion from one practice to the other is encouraged. In one phase of this cycle, scholarly knowledge is contextualised <b>and</b> activated within <b>teaching</b> thus stimulating adaptation and construction of craft knowledge. In the complementary phase, craft knowledge is elicited <b>and</b> codified through <b>researching,</b> stimulating adaptation <b>and</b> construction of scholarly knowledge. Studies report important reciprocal benefits of sustained interaction of this type between researchers and teachers <b>and</b> between <b>researching</b> <b>and</b> <b>teaching.</b> Such approaches point to a much higher degree of interactivity between educational <b>research,</b> classroom <b>teaching,</b> <b>and</b> teacher education than is currently typical...|$|R
