5|$|A {{few days}} before fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) investigates a murder in a {{suburban}} home, in which occult paraphernalia has been {{laid out in a}} disorganized manner. Watts contacts Black for help with the case. However, Black is still <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> murder of his friend Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich), who was murdered in Black's home. Watts hangs up when he sees Sammael looking through the house's window, {{but by the time he}} can investigate, Sammael is gone.|$|E

She placed third in her first competition, and she later won the Miss Galaxy competition in 1998. She then spent some time on the Extreme Fitness Team. As part of the Women's Tri-Fitness Championships in 1998, Wilson won {{first place in the}} Grace and Physique round.|$|E
5|$|Improvements in Norfolk's road {{infrastructure}} {{and the development}} of the stagecoach system made Norwich an increasingly popular destination with travellers. Norwich was <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> plague years and was a major city, with attractions and social events second only to London itself. The increasingly prosperous country landowners of Norfolk and Suffolk began visiting Norwich more frequently and staying for longer when they did so.|$|E

5|$|In total, about $48 {{million in}} revenue was lost, and over $10 million was spent on {{expenses}} related to preparing for and <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shutdown. Overall, the shutdown disrupted the state government's activities, the lives of some Minnesotans (especially the most vulnerable), and private sector work such as road construction, but had minimal impact on the larger economy of the state.|$|E

5|$|On July 14, Emily hit Grenada {{which was}} still <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> impact of Hurricane Ivan {{less than a year}} earlier. Emily {{resulted}} in one reported fatality and significant damage {{in the northern part of}} the country, including Carriacou which had been spared the worst effects of Ivan. 16houses were destroyed and well over 200 more were damaged, and two of the main hospitals were flooded. Damages in Grenada amounted to $110.4million.|$|E

5|$|Percy {{was also}} the most {{damaging}} of the February cyclones as it battered the Cook Islands, which were still <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> impacts of Cyclones Meena, Nancy and Olaf. Percy then devastated the island of Tokelau, leaving many homeless and millions in dollars in property damages (although exact damage figures are unavailable). Because of warnings {{in anticipation of the}} storm, there were no deaths and {{there were only a few}} injuries.|$|E
5|$|Pineda {{began the}} 2013 {{season on the}} 60-day DL as he was still <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{shoulder}} surgery. He was activated from the disabled list on July 8, 2013, and optioned to the minor leagues, where he pitched for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Class AAA International League. In six games pitched for the RailRiders, Pineda had a 1–1 record and a 3.86 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{generally}} {{agree that}} Sycorax, a foil for Prospero, {{is closely related}} to the Medea of Ovid's Metamorphoses. Postcolonialist writers and critics see Sycorax as giving voice to peoples, particularly women, <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> effects of colonisation. Later versions of The Tempest, beginning with William Davenant's eighteenth-century adaptation, have given Sycorax a vocal role in the play, but maintained her image as a malevolent antagonist to Prospero.|$|E
50|$|While Antetonitrus is not <b>the</b> {{earliest}} sauropod <b>from</b> a phylogenetic standpoint, {{it currently}} {{one of the}} oldest known sauropod chronologically, or rather tied for that distinction with other early sauropods <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same formation, like Melanorosaurus and Blikanasaurus. Fossils of these animals were <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Elliot Formation. Initially it was though to be <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Lower Elliot Formation which dates to the Norian stage of the Late Triassic, or approximately 221 to 210 million years ago. Later studies indicate that it was actually <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Early Jurassic Upper Elliot Formation. Before Antetonitrus and <b>the</b> other animals <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Lower Elliot Formation were recognized as sauropods, the oldest known sauropod had been Isanosaurus <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Rhaetian stage of Thailand.|$|R

40|$|Mycoplasma salivarium was <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{blood of}} a five-year-old {{girl who had}} leukemia and {{subsequently}} developed pneumonitis. The patient's pneumonitis {{failed to respond to}} nafcillin, a cell-wall-active antibiotic, but eventually she <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pneumonia after a regimen of erythromycin. Sputum, oropharyngeal, and nasopharyngeal cultures revealed normal bacterial flora; a blood culture was negative for bacteria. Throat and sputum cultures were negative for mycoplasma; however, M salivarium was <b>recovered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> patient's blood. The patient had a cold hemagglutinin titer of 1 : 250...|$|R
5|$|The Bubonic Plague struck Gaza {{again in}} 1839 and the city, lacking {{political}} and economic stability, went {{into a state of}} stagnation. In 1840 Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza. The Ottomans won control of the territory, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. However, the battles brought about more death and destruction in Gaza whilst the city was still <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> effects of the plague.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{which was}} also {{the second day of}} Battle of Thermopylae, the Persian fleet, now <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> two storms, declined to attack the Allies, and instead attempted to make the fleet seaworthy again. News of the shipwreck off Euboea reached the Allies that day, as well as a reinforcement of 53 ships from Athens.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, he {{was invited}} to the national team's summer orientation camp in anticipation of the 2010 Winter Olympics. Booth later recalled that making the Olympic team was his goal {{at the start of the}} 2009–10 season. During the first month of NHL play, however, Booth suffered a concussion and was sidelined long-term. When the final Olympic roster was announced on January 1, 2010, Booth was still <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> injury and he was not selected.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from abroad, Laurer held several different jobs: a cocktail waitress in a strip club, singer in a band, and a 900-number chat line worker. In her mid-to-late 20s, {{while living in}} the Florida Keys, she took a six-week class to train to be a flight attendant. On {{the way to her}} first flight, she was in a car accident and spent four days in the hospital. After <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> accident, Laurer's sister Kathy helped her get a job selling pagers, and both women also worked as belly dancers.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{pipeline}} caused a massive economic boom in towns up and down {{the pipeline}} route. Prior to construction, most residents in towns like Fairbanks—still <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood—strongly supported the pipeline. By 1976, after the town's residents had endured a spike in crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for the worse. The boom was even greater in Valdez, where the population jumped from 1,350 in 1974 to 6,512 by the summer of 1975 and 8,253 in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Early in its duration, Keith {{produced}} {{moderate to}} heavy rainfall in Honduras, Jamaica, and Cuba. Minimal damage {{was reported in}} Mexico, which was still <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> effects of Hurricane Gilbert two months prior. Keith, the last of four named tropical cyclones to hit the United States during the season, produced moderate rainfall, rough storm surge, and gusty winds across central Florida. Overall damage was fairly minor but widespread, totaling $7.3million (1988USD; $ USD). Near the coast of Florida, damage occurred mainly from storm surge and beach erosion. Further inland there were floods, downed trees and power lines. No fatalities were reported.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Richard {{underwent}} a rehabilitation {{program with the}} aim of <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> effects of the stroke. He trained with the Astros and the Texas Southern University team, participating regularly in pitching and batting practice with both {{towards the end of the}} baseball season. After pitching in a few simulated games, Richard was placed on the 40-man active roster on September 1, 1981. Astros manager Bill Virdon thought Richard was not ready to return, so Richard did not pitch with the team during the last two months of the season.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Brown {{was briefly}} hospitalized for hypertension, {{and near the}} end of his term, he {{underwent}} quadruple bypass surgery. While <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> surgery, Brown suffered a rare pulmonary disease, keeping him hospitalized for weeks, part of which he was comatose. He had no pulse for a period of time, and one of his lungs partially collapsed. Brown's office tried to conceal the seriousness of his condition, drawing fire from the press. Following his recovery, he gave up smoking and took up jogging.|$|E
5|$|In its seventh game, Tech {{suffered}} {{its first}} loss. Traveling to Morgantown, West Virginia, home of West Virginia University, the third-ranked Hokies lost 28–7 to the No. 23 Mountaineers. The loss was Tech's worst since November 2001, and knocked the previously undefeated Hokies out of contention {{for the national}} championship. The Hokies returned home to face another high-ranking opponent, No.2 Miami. <b>Recovering</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> loss against West Virginia, the Hokies delivered one of the highest-profile wins in school history, defeating the second-ranked Hurricanes 31–7. The game ended a 39-game regular-season winning streak by Miami and was Tech's first victory over a top-eight team in 34games.|$|E
