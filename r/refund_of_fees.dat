2500|$|During World War II, it was {{a common}} {{practice}} of many railroad companies to issue wharfage charges on customers when transporting goods from railroad cars and onto piers, or vice versa. At {{some point during the}} war, the United States government (referred to by the Court in its decision as the [...] "Government") took over operating control of a number of piers in Norfolk, Virginia. Instead of using the railroad companies' wharfage services, the Government transferred its cargo to and from piers using its own materials. The Government, not requiring any railroad services apart from transporting the goods to and from the site, requested that it be granted an allowance for the wharfage fees, effectively asking for a <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> already paid before the request was made. The railroads refused to make this allowance, prompting the Government to request that the railroads then perform the services themselves, a request which the railroads also denied.|$|E

5000|$|Graceba was {{involved}} with a legal dispute with the FCC regarding allegedly improper procedure {{that took place in}} 1994 during an auction of licenses to provide interactive video data service (IVDS) in local telecommunications markets. In 1997 the courts ruled against Graceba's petition, on the grounds that their complaint wasn't registered in a timely fashion. [...] Graceba then resubmitted their petition on appeal, and it was rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2000. [...] However, the FCC did implicitly acknowledge the legitimacy of at least part of Graceba's complaints, as they issued a partial <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> to the participants of the 1994 auction.|$|E

Hartlepool funded his rehabilitation and also allowed him to return home. However, Ross refused to return to Hartlepool, train or play for the club and asked Hartlepool's chairman Ken Hodcroft to tear up his contract claiming his was homesick. Hartlepool refused and asked for compensation and a <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> agent <b>fees.</b> Ross left without consent and later went on sick and claimed that he would not return to Hartlepool even if [...] "they were in the Champions League". He also criticised Hartlepool manager Neale Cooper for feeling let down by his actions, stating that [...] "maybe the manager thinks I have let him down but that's nothing compared with how I feel about him". On 31 July 2005, Hartlepool agreed to terminate his contract after finally receiving compensation, which included a <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fees</b> paid to Ross's agent.|$|R

50|$|Equity Club Model - With equity clubs, the {{up-front payment}} can be {{considered}} an investment of sorts (or at least {{a reduction in the}} opportunity cost of making the up-front payment), subject to typical investment risks. When exiting the club, the <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> that <b>fee</b> is adjusted to reflect changes to the value of the home portfolio or in the fee for new members. Various clubs have different ways of providing this benefit. Also, with an equity club, the members own the club's real estate portfolio, which provides additional security of the membership deposits.|$|R

My bets also {{increased}} rapidly from one or two dollars to at least five to ten dollars. When I was lucky, I won several hundred dollars. However, I did lose several hundreds in one visit. I experienced a string of ill luck losing my pocket money, my rental fees and even what my parents transferred to me for my study. I had no money to buy food and to pay rent. I was so desperate that I ended up borrowing money from my friends and fellow classmates. I knew that my parents could not afford to send me money. I withdrew from the school to get a <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> the tuition <b>fee</b> so that I could continue gambling to recoup losses. But I lost again and again. I felt extremely guilty after gambling but on the next day I returned to the casino to chase after losses. I avoided meeting friends, classmates and anyone from whom I had borrowed money.|$|R

5000|$|Originally, the O'Farrell Theatre's {{management}} {{paid their}} dancers a flat fee per shift; in the 1980s, they replaced that fee {{with the federal}} minimum wage but allowed the women to accept tips. In 1994, Vince Stanich (the ecdysiasts' boss) created a separate company, Dancers Guild International (DGI), and changed the dancers' status from paid employees to that of unpaid [...] "independent contractors" [...] who had to pay DGI [...] "stage fees" [...] of up to $300 per eight-hour shift. Many O'Farrell stripteasers considered Stanich's new policy unfair and possibly illegal; two of them, Ellen Vickery and Jennifer Bryce, filed a class-action lawsuit against DGI (the plaintiffs would ultimately number more than 500), arguing that Stanich's reclassification of the dancers as independent contractors was unlawful {{and that they were}} owed back wages as well as a <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> the stage <b>fees.</b> The case was settled in 1998; the dancers were awarded $2.85 million. [...] Similar suits challenging independent contractor status have since been filed against numerous other strip clubs, and labor commissions as well as the courts have consistently ruled in favor of dancers and awarded past wages and stage fee reimbursements. The O'Farrell's management still adamantly opposes all attempts of the dancers to unionize.|$|R
