5|$|In {{a survey}} {{released}} by the Pew Research Center in April 2007, viewers who watch both The Colbert <b>Report</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Daily Show {{tend to be more}} knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of The Colbert <b>Report</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Daily Show viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by Jim Lehrer's program at 53% and Bill O'Reilly's program at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The survey shows that changing news formats have not made much difference on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know. The Project for Excellence in Journalism released a content analysis report suggesting that The Daily Show comes close to providing the complete daily news.|$|E
