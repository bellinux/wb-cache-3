50|$|The {{condensed}} and pressurized liquid refrigerant is next {{routed through}} the <b>receiver-drier,</b> that is, a one way desiccant and filter cartridge that both dehydrates the refrigerant and compressor lubricant oil mixture {{in order to}} remove any residual water content (which would become ice inside the expansion valve and therefore clog it) that the vacuum done prior to the charging process didn't manage to remove from the system, and filters {{it in order to}} remove any solid particles carried by the mixture, and then through a thermal expansion valve where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure. That pressure reduction results in flash evaporation of a part of the liquid refrigerant, lowering its temperature. The cold refrigerant is then routed through the evaporator coil in the passenger compartment.|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} an {{air-conditioning system}} performance on board {{of a car}} is quite cumbersome and tedious process due to the limitation of space in the engine compartment. This paper presents the process of designing and the result from the automotive refrigeration system simulation that have been integrated into the test rig. To perform the test on automotive refrigeration simulator the location for the temperature measurement selected and thermocouples were installed. The locations of the temperature probes are at the inlet and outlet of compressor, condenser outlet and the inlet of the evaporator. The gas pressure was measured at low and high pressure sides located at evaporator outlet and <b>receiver-drier</b> respectively. The test results were analyzed using the properties table of the refrigerant used. The coefficient of performance (COP), cooling load {{of the system and}} compressor power consumption were determined. The variable parameters used are the evaporator blower speed and the air velocity passes through the condenser. The experimental results obtained show that increasing the blower speed will reduce the COP of the refrigeration system. The maximum COP of the system is 4. 3 at the lowest evaporator blower speed. The power consumption will be reduced when the air flow velocity through the condenser is varied from 0 to 70 km/hr respectively...|$|E
