The way they ship obelisks {{is to make a}} hole in the stern of the ship, and run the obelisk in, p'inted end foremost; and this obelisk filled up nearly the whole of that ship from stern to bow. We was about ten days out, and sailing afore a northeast gale with the engines at full speed, when suddenly we spied breakers ahead, and our Captain saw we was about to <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank.</b> Now if we hadn't had an obelisk on board we might have sailed over that bank, but the captain knew that with an obelisk on board we drew too much water for this, and that we'd be wrecked in about fifty-five seconds if something wasn't done quick. So he had to do something quick, {{and this is what he}} did: He ordered all steam on, and drove slam-bang on that bank. Just as he expected, we stopped so suddint that that big obelisk bounced for'ard, its p'inted end foremost, and went clean through the bow and shot out into the sea. The minute it did that the vessel was so lightened that it rose in the water and we easily steamed over the bank. There was one man knocked overboard by the shock when we struck, but as soon as we missed him we went back after him and we got him all right. You see, when that obelisk went overboard, its butt-end, which was heaviest, went down first, and when it touched the bottom it just stood there, and as it was such a big obelisk there was about five and a half feet of it stuck out of the water. The man who was knocked overboard he just swum for that obelisk and he climbed up the hiryglyphics. It was a mighty fine obelisk, and the Egyptians had cut their hiryglyphics good and deep, so that the man could get hand and foot-hold; and when we got to him and took him off, he was sitting high and dry on the p'inted end of that obelisk. It was a great pity about the obelisk, for it was a good obelisk, but as I never heard the company tried to raise it, I expect it is standing there yet." ...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis {{has shown that}} a liquidity risk {{plays an important role}} in the current developed financial system. One of the efficient tools of liquidity risk management is stress testing which can show banks their potential vulnerability to liquidity shocks. The aim of this paper is therefore to measure the liquidity risk sensitivity of Czech commercial banks and to find out the most severe scenario and the most vulnerable bank. Our sample included significant part of the Czech banking sector; we used unconsolidated balance sheet data over the period from 2000 to 2011 which were obtained from annual reports of Czech banks. We have evaluated liquidity risk of each bank in the sample via six different liquidity ratios. Then we stressed these baseline values in three stress scenarios: <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> (simulated by a 20 % withdrawal of deposits), confidence crisis on the interbank market (simulated by a withdrawal of 20 % of interbank deposits) and use of committed loans by counterparties (simulated by a 5 % increase of loans provided to nonbank clients). We measured the impact of all scenarios by relative change of liquidity ratios. The impact of modelled liquidity shocks differs among scenarios. The most serious liquidity problems would be caused by the first scenario – <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank.</b> The negative influence of third scenario (use of committed loans) is less severe. The confidence crisis on the interbank market would not affect bank liquidity at all. The results also show that the severity of the impact of all scenarios worsens in periods of financial distress. We have also found that large and medium sized banks are most vulnerable to liquidity shocks, mainly to massive deposit withdrawals...|$|E

40|$|State {{regulation}} — the use {{of standard}} setting, behaviour modification and information-gathering tools by state institutions to influence the everyday actions {{of public and private}} actors — has been a long-established feature of UK governance (Moran 2003). While its form and content have evolved over time, in line with the prevailing political-economic logic of the era, regulatory change is often particularly acute during periods of crisis. In many ways, regulation and crises are natural bedfellows. In moments of crisis, when the fabric of society is threatened, states (especially liberal democratic states with high public expectations placed upon them) need to act. Regulation has become a matter of recourse in these circumstances. Braithwaite (2008) accordingly observes that regulatory innovation and expansion often follows crises, and the recent global financial crisis — marked in the UK by the first <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> since the late 19 th century — is no exception...|$|E

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS Northern Rock was created by the merger of two “building societies, ” the Northern Counties and the Rock, on July 1, 1965. Building societies were mutual organizations, owned by their depositors and their borrowers. Their deposits came primarily from retail customers, and their major (essentially sole) lending activity was to individuals to buy residences. In the 1990 s these organizations were allowed to demutualize and “convert ” (in the terminology of the time) to banks. Most large societies converted, and Northern Rock was among them.

40|$|For {{three days}} in August 2007, the UK {{experienced}} its first <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> since Overend and Gurney, the London wholesale discount bank in 1866. Around £ 3 billion of deposits were withdrawn (around 11 percent of the bank’s total retail deposits) from a medium sized bank – Northern Rock (NR). The unedifying spectacle of widely-publicised long queues outside the bank’s branches testified to the bank’s serious problems. The NR crisis {{was the first time}} the Bank of England (BOE), the UK’s central bank, had operated its new money market regime in conditions of acute stress in financial markets, and it was the first time it had acted as a lender-of-last-resort for many years. Northern Rock (previously a UK mutual building society) converted to bank status in 1997. Without the previous constraints on its operating permissions, it acquired legal powers to conduct the full range of banking business. However, it remained focussed predominantly on the residential mortgage market. From the outset, it adopted a securitisation and funding strategy which was increasingly based on secured wholesale money (by issuing mortgage-backed securities) and other capital market funding. Before considering the nature of the NR crisis, several points of perspective are noted at the outset: the bank remained legally solvent (the nominal value of assets exceeding liabilities), only months earlier the bank had reported record profits, the quality of its assets was never in question, its loan-loss record was good by industry standards, and for many years the bank was regarded as a star-performer in the financial markets. Two problems emerged during the summer months of 2007 : there was a generalised lack of confidence in a particular asset class (mortgage bank securities) associated in large part with developments in the sub-prime mortgage market in the United States; and doubts emerged about the viability of the NR business model in particular. In September 2007, NR was forced to seek substantial assistance from the BOE even after the regulatory authorities, the UK’s Financial Services Authority (FSA) and the Treasury (the UK government’s finance office), had given assurances that the bank was solvent, and all deposits at the bank would be guaranteed...|$|E

40|$|An {{economy in}} which deposit-taking <b>banks</b> of <b>a</b> Diamond/ Dybvig style and an asset market coexist is modelled. Firstly, within this {{framework}} we characterize distinct financial systems depending on the fraction of households with direct investment opportunities that are less efficient than those available to banks. With this fraction comparatively low, the evolving financial system {{can be interpreted as}} market-oriented. In this system, banks only provide efficient investment opportunities to households with inferior investment alternatives. Banks are not active in the secondary financial market nor do they provide any liquidity insurance to their depositors. Households participate to a large extent in the primary {{as well as in the}} secondary financial markets. In the other case of a relatively high fraction of households with inefficient direct investment opportunities, a bank-dominated financial system arises, in which banks provide liquidity transformation, are active in secondary financial markets and are the only player in primary markets, while households only participate in secondary financial markets. Secondly, we analyze the effect <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single <b>bank</b> has <b>on</b> the entire financial system.

40|$|The views {{expressed}} in this working paper {{are those of the}} authors and not necessarily Around the turn of the previous century banking panics in the U. S. happened fairly frequently. Before the creation of the Federal Reserve, major financial crises occurred in the United States in 1873, 1884, 1890, 1893, and 1907. Using a Markov-switching model (MSM) and weekly data between 1890 and 1909, we examine periods of panic and periods of relative calm and objectively date the onset and conclusion of the banking panics. The MSM also has imbedded within it a mechanism that allows us to examine the economic circumstances that might have precipitated <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> panic.

40|$|In {{autumn of}} 2007 Britain {{experienced}} its first bank run of any significance since {{the reign of}} Queen Victoria. The <b>run</b> was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> called Northern Rock. This was extraordinary, for Britain had been free of such episodes because by early {{in the third quarter}} of the 19 th century the Bank of England had developed techniques to prevent them. A second extraordinary aspect of the affair was that it was the decision to provide support for the troubled institution that triggered the run.
