500|$|In September 2017, Matt Cameron told Billboard {{that he and}} {{the other}} {{surviving}} members of Soundgarden had yet {{to make a decision about}} the future of the band following Cornell's death. He was quoted as saying, [...] "I don't think we're <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything other than ... Kim and Ben and I are certainly aware of how much our fans are hurting, and we're certainly hurting right there along with them. But we're extremely private people, and we're all still processing our grief in our own way and on our own time. But we definitely are thinking of our fans and love them very much." ...|$|E
500|$|Along with {{introducing}} the band's new sound, the song opens the album as {{a statement of}} intent. Lyrically, new anticipations and appetites are suggested ("I'm ready for what's next"), as is a willingness to throw caution to the wind and take risks ("I'm ready {{to let go of}} the steering wheel"). Some of the lyrics, particularly those in the bridge before the final chorus, use the eponymous subway station as a metaphor for time: [...] "Time is a train / Makes the future the past / Leaves you standing in the station / Your face pressed up against the glass". Bono cites the enjoyment of his first child born in 1989 as a major influence on Achtung Baby, as was his wife's second pregnancy during the album's 1991 recording. Bono says babies influenced the lines from the first verse, [...] "I'm <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I'm glad to be alive / I'm ready, I'm ready for the push".|$|E
500|$|The {{matter of}} overly {{simplified}} illustrations of the equality {{is a subject}} of pedagogical discussion and critique. [...] discusses the argument that, in elementary school, one is taught that , so, ignoring all essential subtleties, [...] "multiplying" [...] this identity by [...] gives [...] [...] He further says that this argument is unconvincing, because of an unresolved ambiguity {{over the meaning of}} the equals sign; a student might think, [...] "It surely {{does not mean that the}} number [...] is identical to that, which is meant by the notation [...]" [...] Most undergraduate mathematics majors encountered by Byers feel that while [...] is [...] "very close" [...] to [...] on the strength of this argument, with some even saying that it is [...] "infinitely close", they are not <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that it is equal to .

[...] "Let one of you run over there an' tell him what we're <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> do. <b>Say</b> we'll begin the {{scrimmage}} {{as soon as he}} gives the word." ...|$|R

500|$|Although Drymon had a {{significant}} influence on SpongeBob SquarePants, he was not initially offered a role on the series. As a late recruit to Rocko's Modern Life, he had not established much of a relationship with Hillenburg before SpongeBobs conception. Hillenburg first sought out Drymon's storyboard partner, Mark O'Hare - but O'Hare had just created the soon-to-be syndicated comic strip, Citizen Dog, and while he would later join SpongeBob as a writer, lacked {{the time to get}} involved with both projects at the outset. Drymon has said, [...] "I remember Hillenburg's bringing it up to Mark in our office and asking him if he'd be interested in working on it...I was all <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> yes to the offer, but Steve didn't ask; he just left the room. I was pretty desperate...so I ran into the hall after him and basically begged him for the job. He didn't jump at the chance." [...] Once Hillenburg had given it some thought and decided to bring Drymon on as creative director, the two began meeting at Hillenburg's house multiple times a week to develop the series. Drymon has identified this period as having begun in 1996, shortly after the end of Rocko's Modern Life.|$|E
2500|$|So notorious {{did their}} {{activities}} become that I learned when I first went {{away from home}} that when I had to give my address as [...] "Cosby," [...] I should be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Yes, they make it up there." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{describing}} [...] "blind {{singers and}} footloose bards" [...] around Clarksdale, Handy wrote, [...] "surrounded by crowds of country folks, they would pour their hearts out in song ... They earned their living by selling their own songs—'ballets,' {{as they called}} them—and I'm <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in their behalf that seldom did their creations lack imagination." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{well you}} are a {{confirmed}} bachelor, or declarations like these would mar your fortunes. I will admit that the school is not as retiring and diffident as formerly; for we are all <b>ready</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that no times are egual to our own times; but I shall strenuously protest against your interpretation {{of the nature and}} artlessness of an American girl." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "there's no bridge, no pathway {{between now}} and the $100 billion number...so one of the real crunch issues here, which I think will {{determine}} whether we will get out of the building with an agreement or not, is whether developed countries are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> at least <b>say</b> that they're going to match what they've been providing thus far." ...|$|R
2500|$|The American poet Walt Whitman {{declared}} himself agnostic {{on the issue}} and refrained from endorsing an alternative candidacy. Voicing his skepticism to Horace Traubel, Whitman remarked, [...] "While I am not yet <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Bacon I am decidedly unwilling to say Shaksper. I {{do not seem to}} have any patience with the Shaksper argument: it is all gone for me-all up the spout. The Shaksper case is about closed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Citing the {{extensive}} dissent filed by Brandeis, Holmes {{says that he}} need [...] "add but a few words." [...] While he is not <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the penumbra of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments covers the defendant, he does concur that even apart from the Constitution, {{the government should be}} prohibited to use evidence obtained (and only obtainable) by a criminal act. Holmes writes that in his opinion, it would be a lesser evil that some criminals should escape prosecution than that the government [...] "should play an ignoble part." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{average age}} of the U.S. team was 21 years old, making it the {{youngest}} team in U.S. team history to play in the Olympics. It would be the youngest team in the Olympic tournament. But Brooks had selected carefully and knew the limits of every player. As forward John Harrington said, [...] "He knew exactly where to quit. He'd push you right to the limit where you were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'I've had it, I'm throwing it in'—and then he'd back off." [...] Brooks continued the organization by campaigning for the players' selection of Eruzione as the captain, and Craig had been the goalie for him in the 1979 World Championship tournament. Assistant coach Craig Patrick had played with Brooks on the 1967 U.S. national team.|$|E
60|$|After {{that all}} was confusion. Fletcher was seized by those who had {{witnessed}} the deed; there was none thought it an accident; indeed, they were all <b>ready</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Fletcher had received excessive provocation. He was haled {{to the presence of}} the Duke with whom were Grey and Wilding at the time; and old Dare's son--an ensign in Goodenough's company--came clamouring for vengeance backed by such goodly numbers that the distraught Duke was forced to show at least the outward seeming of it.|$|R
5000|$|In Ponyville, everypony {{is getting}} <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> {{celebrate}} Hearth's Warming together in Twilight Sparkle's castle. However, when Twilight Sparkle and Spike ask Starlight Glimmer {{if she is}} <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> celebrate, she <b>says</b> she [...] "might just skip it", as she considers it [...] "a day dedicated to presents and candy". Twilight tries to explain Hearth's Warming is mostly about spending time with friends and family, but Starlight is not interested; to convince her, Twilight decides to read [...] "A Hearth's Warming Tale".|$|R
60|$|These are Mrs. Mapleside's peculiarities, {{and nothing}} will shake {{her faith in}} her view of the subjects; on all other points she is the most easy old lady possible, hardly having any opinion of her own, and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> do, or <b>say</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> give pleasure to others. On the whole {{she is one of}} the kindest and most cheerful old ladies in the world.|$|R
2500|$|In January 2009, the Ontario {{branch of}} the Canadian Union of Public Employees brought forward a {{proposal}} to ban Israeli academics from teaching at Ontario Universities. CUPE-Ontario leader Sid Ryan stated, [...] "we are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Israeli academics should not be on our campuses unless they explicitly condemn the university bombing and the assault on Gaza in general." [...] Ryan subsequently said, [...] "Academic freedom goes both ways. What we are saying is {{if they want to}} remain silent and be complicit in these kinds of actions, why should they enjoy the freedom to come and teach in other countries like Canada?" [...] CUPE's national president, Paul Moist, issued a statement declaring his opposition to the motion and saying, [...] "I will be using my influence in any debates on such a resolution to oppose its adoption." ...|$|E

6000|$|That was {{the longest}} night Rose ever spent, but joy came {{in the morning with}} the early message: [...] "He is better. You are to come by and by." [...] Then Aunt Plenty forgot her lumbago and arose; Aunt Myra, who had come to have a social croak, took off her black bonnet as if it would not be needed at present, and the girl made <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go and <b>say</b> [...] "Welcome back," [...] not the hard [...] "Good-bye." ...|$|R
5000|$|In May when Trump was {{declared}} the presumptive nominee, Ryan told CNN {{that he was}} not <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> endorse Trump, <b>saying</b> [...] "I'm not there right now." [...] He questioned Trump's commitment to conservative values but added he hoped to back him eventually. Trump and Ryan met once during May, and on June 2 Ryan published an op-ed piece endorsing Trump and stressing the need to prevent Hillary Clinton's election. Ryan later explained that as Majority Leader he feels obligated to support the Republican nominee in the interest of party unity.|$|R
2500|$|As police arrived, {{the house}} lights {{were brought up}} and Brewer pointed out Oswald sitting near {{the rear of the}} theater. Police Officer Nick McDonald testified that {{he was the first to}} reach Oswald and that Oswald seemed <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> {{surrender}} <b>saying,</b> [...] "Well, it is all over now." [...] McDonald said that Oswald pulled out a pistol tucked into the front of his pants, then pointed the pistol at him, and pulled the trigger. McDonald stated that the pistol did not fire because the pistol's hammer came down on the webbing between the thumb and index finger of his hand as he grabbed for the pistol. McDonald also said that Oswald struck him, but that he struck back and Oswald was disarmed. As he was led from the theater, Oswald shouted he was a victim of police brutality.|$|R

"How <b>to</b> get <b>ready</b> {{for running}} off," [...] said Jim Leonard, {{and at that}} Pony's heart went down, {{but he did not}} like to show it, and Jim Leonard went on: [...] "We've got to {{provision}} the raft, you know, for maybe we'll catch on an island and be a week getting to the city. We've got to float with the current, anyway. Well, now, we can make a hole in the hay here and hide the provisions till we're <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go. I <b>say</b> we'd better begin hiding them right away. Let's see if we can make a place. Get away, Trip." ...|$|R
5000|$|On August 2, 2008, in an {{interview}} with The Morning Call, band member Paul Meany spoke about the new record. [...] "We want to keep it in the oven and make sure things are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go," [...] <b>says</b> Meany. [...] "Anyone who thinks first album is perfect will hate this new record. If you heard the first record and liked some stuff about it but think things could improve, you may like it. It's important for us to change up the formula. We thought we were writing new album for the last 2½ years on the road, but found out we weren't. We just started three months ago." ...|$|R
60|$|It annoyed me, and I remarked rather sharply that I didn't {{see what}} there was to laugh at in what I had told them. Then the lady with <b>ready</b> tact {{interposed}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> she had been deeply interested in my experiences, {{and went on to}} tell what she had done to save the birds in her own place; and her companion, taking it perhaps as a snub to himself from her, picked up his knife and fork and went on with his luncheon, and never opened his mouth to speak again. Or, at all events, not till he had quite finished his meal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Though I too am <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> extirpate, extirpate! But in my {{ignorance of}} {{political}} work, {{permit me to}} ask: A Balkan--well--intrigue, wouldn't that take a very long time?" ...|$|E

The woman turned crimson, for she read the words: [...] "LOOK UPON THYSELF".|$|R
