5000|$|<b>Rotovators</b> {{can thus}} be charged by {{momentum}} exchange. Momentum charging uses the rotovator to move mass from {{a place that is}} [...] "higher" [...] in a gravity field to a place that is [...] "lower". The technique to do this uses the Oberth effect, where releasing the payload when the tether is moving with higher linear speed, lower in a gravitational potential gives more specific energy, and ultimately more speed than the energy lost picking up the payload at a higher gravitational potential, even if the rotation rate is the same. For example, it is possible to use a system of two or three <b>rotovators</b> to implement trade between the Moon and Earth. The <b>rotovators</b> are charged by lunar mass (dirt, if exports are not available) dumped on or near the Earth, and can use the momentum so gained to boost Earth goods to the Moon. The momentum and energy exchange can be balanced with equal flows in either direction, or can increase over time.|$|E
5000|$|Unfortunately an Earth-to-orbit <b>rotovator</b> {{cannot be}} built from {{currently}} available materials since the thickness and tether mass {{to handle the}} loads on the <b>rotovator</b> would be uneconomically large.

40|$|In this research, field {{performance}} of four weeding methods for peanut crop {{was investigated in}} Kiashahr located at Guilan province. The weeding methods were included weeding by two types of motorized weeders (power tiller operated cultivator and power tiller operated <b>rotovator</b> at three forward speeds of 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 km/h), weeding by hand-driven wheeled cultivator and hand weeding by trench hoe. A randomized complete block design with three replications {{was used for the}} experiment. Weeding index, crop yield, field capacity, energy consumption and the economical index of benefit-cost ratio were measured and determined. Results showed that the highest weeding efficiencies of 98. 61 and 97. 37 % were obtained in hand weeding for the first and second weeding stages, respectively. In all the mechanical treatments, the weeding efficiency of the second stage was greater than that of the first stage. The highest value of field capacity in the first stage (0. 1263 km/h) and second stage (0. 1287 ha/h) was recorded for power tiller operated <b>rotovator</b> at travel speed of 2. 0 km/h. with amount of field efficiency was achieved in weeding with tiller <b>rotovator</b> at forward speed of 2 km/h (0. 1263 and 0. 1287 ha/h for first and second stages of weeding operation respectively). Among the methods, the lowest value of energy consumption with the average of 307. 8 Mj/ha was registered for hand-driven wheeled cultivator. Results also indicated that power tiller operated <b>rotovator</b> at forward speed of 1. 0 km/h had the highest benefit-cost ratio of 2. 06 compared to other treatments. Thus, weeding by power tiller operated <b>rotovator</b> at forward speed of 1. 0 km/h is advisable for peanut cultivation in the region...|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} during May - July, 2015 on loamy sand soil at the Agronomy Farm of Eastern University to compare the effect of different tillage practices on soil saturated hydraulic conductivity at 10 cm depth. The experiment was arranged in a split plot design with three replications where two types of tillage implements (mould board plough and <b>rotovator)</b> were assigned as main plot factors and the speed of operation of the implements such as 0. 45, 0. 65 and 0. 85 m/s as sub plot factors. The treatment combinations were randomly distributed in each block, {{resulting in a total}} of 18 plots. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using Guelph permeameter. The rate of fall of the water level in the reservoir was observed at 1 minute interval. One set of steady flow rate measurements was made at a constant pressure head of 5 cm water. The hydraulic conductivities were then calculated using “Guelph Permeameter Calculator” spreadsheet. Greatest hydraulic conductivity was obtained with <b>rotovator</b> than mould board plough due to the achieved lower bulk densities and higher porosity with <b>rotovator.</b> It has been documented that higher hydraulic conductivity under shallow tillage than under mould board ploughing is due to stable macro pores. Thus, the variation in size and number of macro pores in each tillage system has caused greater hydraulic conductivity values with <b>rotovator</b> than with mould board plough. Furthermore, inversive tillage with mould board plough made the aggregates unstable during wetting that could cause lower hydraulic conductivities. After four weeks of tillage, hydraulic conductivity was found to be decreased with increase in bulk density due to soil compaction as the hydraulic properties of soils are affected by soil compaction. The statistical analysis revealed that the tillage implements had a significant effect on hydraulic conductivity, but the operating speed did not have any significant impact on hydraulic conductivity at P < 0. 05. The tillage with <b>rotovator</b> treatments enhanced favorable soil conditions, which facilitated increased hydraulic conductivity of 9. 06 mm/h. The tillage plots with mould board plough resulted in lower hydraulic conductivities. Therefore, under the soil and weather conditions of this experiment, the better tillage practice identified for improved soil hydraulic property is tillage with <b>rotovator...</b>|$|R
50|$|Beanstalks and <b>rotovators</b> are {{currently}} {{limited by the}} strengths of available materials. Although ultra-high strength plastic fibers (Kevlar and Spectra) permit <b>rotovators</b> to pluck masses {{from the surface of}} the Moon and Mars, a rotovator from these materials cannot lift {{from the surface of the}} Earth. In theory, high flying, supersonic (or hypersonic) aircraft could deliver a payload to a rotovator that dipped into Earth's upper atmosphere briefly at predictable locations throughout the tropic (and temperate) zone of Earth. As of May 2013, all mechanical tethers (orbital and elevators) are on hold until stronger materials are available.|$|E
50|$|For {{rotating}} tethers (<b>rotovators)</b> {{the value}} used is the material’s ‘characteristic velocity’ {{which is the}} maximum tip velocity a rotating untapered cable can attain without breaking,The characteristic velocity equals the specific velocity multiplied by the square root of two.|$|E
50|$|Orbital tethers can be tidally locked (skyhook) or {{rotating}} (<b>rotovators).</b> They can {{be designed}} (in theory) {{to pick up the}} payload when the payload is stationary or when the payload is hypersonic (has a high but not orbital velocity).|$|E

5000|$|Therefore, another {{trick to}} achieve lower {{stresses}} is {{that rather than}} picking up a cargo from the ground at zero velocity, a <b>rotovator</b> could pick up a moving vehicle and sling it into orbit.

The various implements studied include; disc plough, 2 -gang tandem disc harrow, ridger, <b>rotovator</b> and 6 -row combine seed planter. Three different makes and models of tractors namely: New Holland (model-NH 5610 SE and capacity- 55. 9 kw), Massey Ferguson (model-MF 430 E and capacity- 55. 2 kw) and Mahindra (model-NH 7570 E and capacity- 55. 9 kw) with 3 - point hitch systems and {{average age of}} 1. 3 years were used to study the field {{performances of}} each of the implements, in five different states that made up the study area. The field performances studied include; implements working speed, operation time, depth of cut, effective and theoretical field capacities, field efficiency, fuel consumption rate, implement power requirements, and wheel slippage, under different soil conditions. Results obtained revealed that the disc plough had field efficiency range of 85. 74 % to 88. 55 %, effective and theoretical field capacities range of 0. 846 to 1. 164 ha/hr and 0. 961 to 1. 319 ha/hr respectively; and the highest field (ploughing) efficiency was obtained in loamy-sandy soil when the plough was operated with the Massey Ferguson tractor. Harrow recorded field efficiency range of 80. 17 to 91. 38 %, effective and theoretical field capacities range of 0. 931 to 1. 458 ha/hr and 1. 151 to 1. 667 ha/hr respectively; and the highest field (harrowing) efficiency was obtained on sandy-clay soil by New Holland tractor. Ridger recorded 83. 65 to 88. 82 % field efficiency, 0. 932 to 1. 322 ha/hr effective capacity and 1. 073 to 1. 504 ha/hr theoretical field capacity; and sandy-clay gave the highest field (ridging) efficiency when operated with a New Holland tractor. The <b>rotovator</b> had field efficiency range of 81. 10 to 89. 81 %, effective and theoretical field capacities range of 0. 759 to 0. 902 ha/hr and 0. 758 to 1. 039 ha/hr respectively; and the highest pulverizing efficiency was achieved on the clay-loam soil with a Massey Ferguson tractor. The planter recorded 80. 63 to 89. 37 field efficiency, 1. 012 to 1. 481 ha/hr effective field capacity and theoretical field capacity of 1. 22 to 1. 716 ha/hr. Ploughing gave the highest average fuel consumption rate of 22. 72 L/ha (8. 89 L/hr), followed by harrowing with average consumption of 19. 57 L/ha (8. 04 L/hr), ridging recorded 19. 42 L/ha (7. 97 L/hr), <b>rotovator</b> had 16. 79 L/ha (7. 19 L/hr) and least was planter with average consumption rate of 15. 10 L/ha (6. 26 L/hr).

40|$|A {{series of}} field {{experiments}} were {{conducted at the}} research farm of The University of Agriculture Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan during 2009 - 10 and 2010 - 2011, to investigate the effects of different tillage practices and sowing methods on productivity of wheat and mungbean cropping system on silty clay loam soil. The factors consisted of tillage practices i. e. tine cultivator twice plowed (TC 2), chisels plow followed by <b>rotovator</b> (CR), mouldboard plow followed by <b>rotovator</b> (MR), disk plow followed by <b>rotovator</b> (DR) and tine cultivator followed by <b>rotovator</b> (TCR) in the main plots and sowing methods i. e. sowing with single box seed drill (SD), combined drill (CD) and broadcast (BC) in the sub plots. The performance of different tillage implements during seedbed preparation in term of soil depth of cut, wheel slippage, fuel consumption and effective field capacity were statistically significant. Maximum soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depth recorded with CR and MR tillage practices, while maximum soil bulk density, soil penetration resistance, at 20 and 40 cm depth, fresh and dry weed biomass were obtained in plots tilled with tine cultivator twice (TC- 2). However, minimum soil penetration resistance and fresh/ dry weed biomass were obtained in plots of CR and MR tillage practices, respectively. Higher soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depth was observed when sowing was done with seed drill and combined drill, respectively. Data regarding wheat crop indicated that higher number of tillers m- 2 (403) and grain yield (4. 6 t ha- 1) were obtained in plots tilled with disk plow followed by rotavator. Similarly, maximum biological yield (10. 4 t ha- 1) was recorded in plots that were tilled with mouldboard plow followed by rotavator. Sowing by combined seed drill resulted in higher emergence, number of tillers, straw yield and biological yield. Similarly, higher number of grains spike- 1, spike length, grain yield and harvest indices were recorded when sowing was done with seed drill. Maximum total nitrogen in soil was noted in plots tilled with tine cultivator followed by rotavator. Similarly, sowing by seed drill and combine drill recorded greater total nitrogen in soil and wheat straw. The data relating to mungbean crop indicated that chisel plow followed by rotavator resulted in higher soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depths, higher emergence m- 2, plant height, pod length and total nitrogen in grains. Plots tilled with tine cultivator twice delayed flowering and maturity, increase in fresh and dry weed biomass, soil bulk density at 20 and 40 cm depth and soil penetration resistance at 20 and 40 cm depths. Number of branch plant - 1, pods plant - 1, biological yield, soil total nitrogen were higher in plots tilled with moldboard plow followed by rotavator. The maximum grain yield of mungbean and soil organic matter were recorded in plots tilled with tine cultivator followed by rotavator. Similarly, maximum harvest indices and total nitrogen in straw were recorded in plots tilled with disk plow followed by rotavator. Higher emergence, plant height, pod length, hundred grain weight, grain yield, biological yield, harvest indices, total soil nitrogen, and total nitrogen in mungbean grain and straw were recorded in plots sown with seed drill. Plots sown with broadcast method delayed flowering and maturity, increase fresh and dry weed biomass and greater soil bulk density at 20 and 40 cm depths. Number of branch plant - 1, pods plant- 1, soil organic matter and total nitrogen in soil were greater in plots that were sown with a combined seed drill. Economic analysis of wheat and mungbean showed that maximum net revenue of wheat was obtained with mouldboard plow followed by rotavator (MR) tillage practices and the highest net revenue of mungbean was found with tine cultivator followed by rotavator (TCR) while minimum net revenue were obtained with tine cultivator (TC- 2). Similarly, sowing by seed drill (SD) and combine drill (CD) resulted in maximum net revenue as compared to broadcast (BC) sowing method. It is concluded from the studies that all tillage implements when followed by rotavator for seedbed preparation resulted better yield and net economic revenue from wheat and mungbean crops {{as compared to the}} sole used of tine cultivator plowed twice. Similarly sowing by seed drill and combined drill showed a higher grain yield and net revenue than broadcast methods...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} the depth of a compacted layer in the yields of some vegetables, in an Andisol, (Tibaitata, Sabana de Bogota) experimental plots compacted to 5, 10, 15 and 30 cm were used.

To test the influence of depth of compaction a split plot design experiment was used in which the main plot was the depth of compaction and the subplots the type of vegetables (cabbage, silver beet and carrots). The depth of the compacted layer had a big influence in the yields of all the tested vegetables. Assuming that the 30 cm depth of compacted layer produced 100 percent, when it was 5 cm the relative yields decreased down to 38, 32 and 22 percent for the same crops respectively, showing the negative influence of oompaction, which affects soil water storage capacity and nutrient absorption by reducing the available soil volume for rooting...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} was initiated in 1997 with non-inverting soil tillage compared to conventional tillage with annual mouldboard ploughing to either 20 cm depth (CT) or 10 cm depth (RCT). The new system included a non-inverting mechanical loosening {{of the soil}} to approximately 35 cm depth combined with a shallow cultivation of the top 5 cm soil by either a <b>rotovator</b> (NIT) or an S-tine harrow (RNIT). The experiment was located on a sandy loam at the organic farmed Rugballegård Experimental Station. A plough pan at 20 - 35 cm depth was identified by cone penetration measurements. The non-inverting tillage system succeeded in breaking up the plough pan, which reduced the cone index from approximately 1. 8 MPa in the CT and RCT treatments to 0. 6 MPa in the NIT treatment. A detailed soil profile description of the top 30 cm of the soil indicated that root growth was restricted for especially CT and RCT treatments in the form of thickened and horizontally deflected roots at the interface between the topsoil and the plough pan at approximately 22 cm depth. For RCT a new plough pan was under development just below the present ploughing depth at 10 cm. This also resulted in root growth restriction, but to a lesser extent than the deeper plough pan. A soil drop test was performed to characterise soil fragmentation. Undisturbed cubic soil samples were taken from the 5 - 15 cm layer and dropped from 75 cm height in to a metal box. The resulting aggregate size distribution differed between the treatments with geometrical mean weight diameter (GMD) of 5. 7 mm 7. 4 mm and 8. 9 mm for CT, RCT and NIT treatments, respectively. The higher degree of fragmentation for the mouldboard ploughed soil may be explained by higher energy input per soil volume by mouldboard ploughing than by non-inverting deep loosening. The results indicate for the 5 _ 15 cm layer, that plant growth conditions were best for CT treated soil, due to a combination of low cone index and small aggregates. For the 20 _ 35 cm layer, the results indicates best plant growth conditions for NIT treated soil due to a low cone index and less restricted root growth. The spring barley/pea mix with grass/clover undersown yielded on average 47. 6 hkg/ha. There {{were no significant differences between}} treatments...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of adjusting soil N mineralization by soil tillage {{in the growing}} season was investigated in winter wheat on a coarse sandy loam. In two succeeding years, wheat was sown at 25 cm row spacing on plots where four different organic matter (OM) management strategies regarding pig slurry application, straw incorporation and catch crop growing had been applied for the previous 13 years. Soil tillage {{was carried out in}} spring with a row cultivator, a PTO-driven row <b>rotovator</b> or a brushweeder. Soil inorganic N content was determined in tilled and undisturbed soil during four weeks after tillage. In the first experimental year, gross nitrogen transformation rates were measured by 15 N pool dilution techniques in row rotovated soil and in undisturbed soil at two of the four OM levels. The three types of soil tillage caused higher inorganic N levels in both years with an extra 7 - 9 µg g- 1 soil in the tilled soil than in the undisturbed reference soil. The N uptake in the above-ground wheat biomass harvested in spring did not respond to tillage or to the increased inorganic N content in soil. There was no effect of tillage on N transformation as measured by 15 N pool dilution. The higher inorganic N content in disturbed soil in the field was therefore assumed to be mainly caused by reduced crop N uptake rather than an increased N mineralization. In the first year, the grain yield of the mature winter wheat was lower after row cultivation than after rotovation and brushweeding but the grain yield after soil tillage was not significantly different from the undisturbed soil. The N uptake in grain was 4 - 5 kg N ha- 1 higher after rotovation and brushweeding compared to undisturbed soil. In the second year, the grain yield was highest after brushweeding whereas {{there was no difference in}} yields between the two other tillage techniques and the undisturbed soil. Soil tillage carried out in the second year did not influence grain N uptake. The N concentration in wheat grain was unaffected by soil tillage in both years. No interactions between tillage and organic matter management were observed. Thus, in regularly ploughed soil as studied here, soil tillage in the growing season does not seem to have a potential for significantly enhancing N availability or improving synchronization between crop demand and N mineralization...|$|R
40|$|Modification {{of black}} cotton soils by {{chemical}} admixtures {{is a common}} method for stabilizing the swell-shrink tendency of expansive soils. Advantages of chemical stabilization are that they reduce the swell-shrink tendency of the expansive soils and also render the soils less plastic. Among the chemical stabilization methods for expansive soils, lime stabilization is most widely adopted method for improving the swell-shrink characteristics of expansive soils. Lime stabilization of clays in field is achieved by shallow mixing of lime and soil or by deep stabilization technique. Shallow stabilization involves scarifying the soil to the required depth and lime in powder or slurry form is spread and mixed with the soil using a <b>rotovator.</b> The use of lime as deep stabilizer has been mainly restricted to improve the engineering behaviour of soft clays Deep stabilization using lime can be divided in three main groups: lime columns, lime piles and lime slurry injection. Lime columns refer to creation of deep vertical columns of lime stabilized material. Lime piles are usually holes in the ground filled with lime. Lime slurry pressure injection, as the name suggests, involves {{the introduction of a}} lime slurry into the ground under pressure. Literature review brings out that lime stabilization of expansive clays in field is mainly performed by mixing of lime and soil up to shallow depths. The use of lime as deep stabilizer has been mainly restricted to improve the engineering behaviour of soft clays. Use of lime in deep stabilization of expansive soils however has not been given due attention. There exists a definite need to examine methods for deep stabilization of expansive soils to prevent the deeper soil layers from causing distress to the structures in response to the seasonal climatic variations. In addition, there exists a need for in-situ soil stabilization using lime in case of distressed structures founded on expansive soil deposits. The physical mixing of lime and soil in shallow stabilization method ensures efficient contact between lime and clay particles of the soil. It however has limitation in terms of application as it is only suited for stabilization of expansive soils to relatively shallow depths. Studies available have not compared the relative efficiency of the lime pile technique and lime-soil mixing method in altering the physico-chemical, index and engineering properties of expansive black cotton soils. To achieve the above objectives laboratory experiments are performed that study: 1. 	the efficacy of lime piles in stabilizing compacted black cotton soil specimens from Chitradurga District in Karnataka. The efficiency of lime piles in chemically stabilizing the compacted black cotton soil mass was investigated as a function of: a) amount of lime contained in the lime pile b) radial migration of lime from the central lime pile c) migration of lime as a function of soil depth 2. the relative impact of the lime pile technique and lime-soil mixing method in altering the physico-chemical, index and engineering properties of expansive black cotton soil. The organization of this thesis is as follows After the first introductory chapter, a detailed review of literature performed towards highlighting the need to examine stabilization of expansive soils using lime pile technique is brought out in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 presents a detailed experimental programme of the study. 25 mm and 75 mm diameter lime piles were installed in the compacted soil mass to study the influence of amount of lime contained in the lime pile on the soil properties. The amount of quick lime contained in the 25 mm and 75 mm lime piles corresponded to 1 % and 3 % by dry weight of the soil mass respectively. Radial and vertical migration of lime from the central lime pile was examined by sampling soil specimens at different radial distances from the central lime pile and at different depths of soil sample. At a given depth and radial distance, migration of lime was estimated by comparing the exchangeable cation composition, pH and pore salinity of the treated soil with that of the natural (untreated) black cotton soil specimen. Alterations in the soil engineering properties at a given depth and radial distance were evaluated by comparing the index properties, swell potential and unconfined compressive strength of the lime pile treated soil specimen with those of the untreated specimen. To compare the relative efficiency of lime mixing and lime pile technique in altering the swelling behaviour of black cotton soil, batches of black cotton soil specimens were treated with 1 % and 3 % quick lime on dry soil weight basis. The compacted soil-lime mixes were cured at moisture contents of 31 - 34 % for a period of 10 days. The physico-chemical, index and engineering properties of the 1 % lime mixed specimens are compared with those of the 25 mm lime pile treated specimens. The properties of the 3 % lime mixed soil specimens are compared with those of the 75 mm lime pile treated specimens. Chapter 4 examines the efficacy of lime piles in stabilizing compacted black cotton soil specimens from Chitradurga District in Karnataka. Experimental results showed that controlling the swell potential of deep expansive soil deposits is possible by the lime pile technique. Treatment with lime pile caused migration of dissociated calcium and hydroxyl ions into the surrounding soil mass. In case of 25 mm lime pile, the experimental setup allowed measurement of migration of lime up to three times the lime pile diameter. In case of 75 mm lime pile, the experimental setup allowed measurement of migration of lime up to 1. 6 times pile diameter. In both experiments, migration of lime was also uniform through out the soil depth of 280 mm. Migration of calcium and hydroxyl ions increased the pore salinity and pH of the treated soil mass. The increase in pH caused clustering of additional exchangeable calcium ions at the negative clay particle edges. The increased pore salinity and exchangeable calcium ions reduced the diffuse ion layer thickness that in turn suppressed the plasticity index and the swell potential of the compacted expansive soil. The laboratory results hence bring out that lime pile treatment in the field can substantially reduce the swell potential of the soil at least to a radial extent of 2 to 3 times the lime pile diameter. The 75 mm lime pile contained lime content in excess of the initial consumption of lime (ICL) value of the black cotton soil - namely 2. 6 %. Laboratory results showed that migration of hydroxyl ions even from the 75 mm pile could not elevate the soil pH to levels required for soil-lime pozzoIonic reactions (pH ≥ 12). The very low solubility of lime in water (< 1 g/litre) and the impervious nature of the black cotton soil are considered to have impeded efficient interactions between lime and soil in course of treatment of the expansive soil with lime piles. Absence of soil-lime pozzolonic reactions precluded the formation of cementation compounds in the lime pile treated soil specimens. Cementation compounds formed by the soil-lime pozzolonic reactions are responsible for the much higher strengths of lime stabilized soils. Consequently, treatment with 25 mm pile had no impact on the unconfined compressive strength of the black cotton soil. Comparatively, treatment with 75 mm lime pile slightly increased the strength of the treated soil due to increased inter-particle attraction and particle flocculation. Chapter 5 compares the relative efficiency of the lime pile technique and lime-soil mixing method in altering the physico-chemical, index and engineering properties of expansive black cotton soil. Experimental results showed that mixing of soil and lime promote stronger chemical interactions between lime released hydroxyl ions and clay particles than that achieved by diffusion of lime from a central lime pile. The more alkaline pH of the lime mixed soil specimens rendered the clay particle edges more negative. Consequently, more calcium ions were adsorbed at the clay particle edges of the lime mixed soil specimens imparting them higher exchangeable calcium contents than the lime pile treated soil specimens. Also, at 3 % lime addition, the pH of the lime-mixed soil was sufficiently high (in excess of 12) to cause dissolution of silica and alumina from the clay lattice necessary for the formation of cementation compounds. The stronger lime modification reactions plus the lime-soil pozzolonic reactions (applicable for soil treated with lime content greater than ICL value) achieved by the lime mixing technique rendered the expansive soil much less plastic, much less expansive and much stronger than the lime pile treated specimens. The results of the laboratory study hence suggest that if a choice exists in the field between conventional method of spreading-mixing-compacting of soil-lime mixes and treating the ground with lime piles, the former technique should be adopted because of its greater efficacy in stabilizing the expansive soil.

40|$|Soil {{fragmentation}} is {{a primary}} aim in most tillage operations {{in order to create}} a soil environment favourable for crop establishment and growth. Soils vary around the world from those exhibiting a self-mulching nature to those of a hardsetting nature. These extremes have been reported for Australian and other tropical and subtropical soils. In humid temperate climates, soil tillage is generally needed in order to produce a favourable environment for crop establishment and growth. The ease of preparing a favourable arable layer depends on complex interactions between climate, soil and the tillage implement. Especially soil water affects soil strength and fragmentation properties and thereby the ease of preparing a suitable arable layer. Soil management affects soil fragmentation and friability indirectly through effects on soil structure formation and stabilization and directly through the influence of soil tillage and traffic. The overall purpose of this thesis is to contribute to the understanding of soil fragmentation and friability as affected by soil management and soil water regime. The reaction of the soil upon tillage was evaluated within the concept of soil tilth as defined by Soil Science Society of America (SSSA) "the physical condition of soil as related to its ease of tillage, fitness as a seedbed, and its impedance to seedling emergence and root penetration". The study involved soils from two case studies, the Askov long-term experiment on animal manure and mineral fertilizers, a field experiment with non-inversion tillage and a field experiment on compaction and intensive tillage. All the soils included in the study were humid sandy loams predominantly developed on Weichselian glacial moraine deposits. The soils were classified as Oxy aquic Agriudolls/Glossic Phaeozems according to Soil Taxonomy/WRB except for the Askov soil that was classified as Ultic Hapludalfs/Dystric Luvisols according to Soil Taxonomy/WRB. For all soils the clay content ranged from about 12 to 21 g per 100 g- 1 and soil organic matter ranged from 1. 8 to 3. 9 g 100 g- 1. The case studies included two long-term forage cropping system soils with a grass ley in the crop rotation (DFG(1) and DFG(2)), which were compared with a neighbouring counterpart. DFG(1) was compared with a forage cropping system soil without grass ley in the crop rotation (i. e., only annual crops), labelled DFA, whereas DFG(2) was compared with a continuously cash cropped soil with very low input of organic matter (no animal manure and straw removed), labelled CCC. An unfertilized (UNF), animal manured (AM) and a mineral fertilized (NPK) soil was included from the Askov long-term experiment on animal manure and mineral fertilizers established in 1894. The tillage experiment included a non-inversion tilled soil, labelled NINV, (non-inversion subsoil loosening to 35 cm depth and seedbed preparation with <b>rotovator)</b> and a conventionally tilled soil, labelled CONV, (mouldboard ploughing to 22 cm and secondary tine cultivation). The experiment on soil compaction and intensive tillage involved two "extreme" tillage and traffic treatments and a reference treatment (REF). The extreme treatments were soil compaction (PAC) and intensive tillage (INT) that were performed on wet soil just after spring ploughing and prior to seedbed preparation. The field experiments on non-inversion tillage, and soil compaction and intensive tillage were both conducted at the organically managed Rugballegård Research Station. Ease of tillage is commonly extrapolated from measurement of tensile strength in a compression test using air-dry or oven-dry aggregates. This procedure may lead to erroneous conclusion on soil behaviour of moist soil in the field. Therefore a multi-level analytical strategy was followed, i. e., soil fragmentation and friability were characterized using qualitative and quantitative in situ, on-field and laboratory methods. Soil fragmentation and friability were assessed in the field qualitatively by visual examination and quantitatively by employing a simple drop-shatter fragmentation test, denoted soil drop test. The energy input in the soil drop test was low in comparison with the energy input in typical seedbed cultivation. However, the soil drop test was sensitive enough to display significant differences between treatments in most cases. In the laboratory soil fragmentation and friability were evaluated by measuring tensile strength and specific rupture energy on field-sampled aggregates. In general, tensile strength was determined on air-dry aggregates and in some cases on aggregates adjusted to pressure potentials in the range - 100 hPa to - 166 MPa (air-dry). In addition, a direct tension test was developed to measure tensile strength of moist soil without making assumptions on the mode of failure. Undisturbed field-sampled soil cores were used in the test. The method was applicable at high matric potentials (- 50 and - 100 hPa) but not at - 300 hPa. The direct tension test results corresponded well with the predicted values determined from the indirect measurements of aggregate tensile strength. In general, a fairly good agreement was found between the different methods in the hierarchy of methods applied. This indicates that sophisticated laboratory methods for assessing soil strength and fragmentation characteristics may well be used for evaluating soil behaviour under conditions prevailing in the field at the time of tillage. Nevertheless, it is recommended that laboratory methods are evaluated by using simple field methods at times and soil conditions appropriate for tillage. The friability index showed in general a low sensitivity to long- and short-term differences in soil management. However, a clear effect of soil water was found, i. e. maximum friability index values at - 300 to - 1000 hPa pressure potential. The effect of soil water on tensile strength and specific rupture energy of aggregates and on estimation of friability was investigated. As expected the study revealed the paramount influence of soil water. Interactions between soil water regime and treatment were found for cropping system soils (DFG(2) vs. CCC) and the fertilization treatments (UNF, NPK and AM) but not for the compaction treatments (PAC vs. REF). It was concluded that it might be hazardous to characterize soil fragmentation and friability properties of different treatments based on measurements at a single pressure potential and significant influence of pore characteristics was detected. Macroporosity was found to correlate to tensile strength and friability index. However, a clear correlation between tensile strength properties and pore geometry characteristics (e. g. tortuousity and continuity) was not shown. This may be due to large small-scale variations in these properties, i. e. the samples for tensile strength determination were taken next to the samples for pore characterization. Marked long-term effects of cropping systems and fertilization were found. For two neighbouring soils with a high input of organic matter, poorer soil mechanical characteristics were found for a soil with grass in the rotation (DFG(1)) than for a soil solely grown with annual crops (mainly cereals). This difference in strength and friability characteristics may be related to a higher amount of biological structural binding and bonding agents in the soil with grass included in the rotation. Two soils with high inputs of organic matter (DFG(2) and AM) displayed more desirable aggregate strength and soil fragmentation characteristics than their counterparts (CCC and UNF, respectively) receiving low inputs of organic matter. Evidence suggests that cementation of dispersed clay was a determining factor for the stronger increase in aggregate tensile strength with increased dryness (decreased pressure potential) found for the CCC and UNF soils receiving low inputs of organic matter compared with DFG(2) and AM. An early-stage effect of non-inversion tillage treatment (NINV) resulted in a poorer soil tilth in the topsoil layer (i. e., higher soil strength and lower ease of fragmentation and friability index) than for a conventionally mouldboard ploughed soil (CONV). Surprisingly, the effect of tillage on topsoil tilth was clearer by the end of the growing season in September than in May. This indicates that natural soil processes occurring during the growing season were not able eliminate the differences between the primary tillage treatments. Soil compaction (PAC) resulted in strongly increased aggregate tensile strength at all the investigated water regimes (i. e., pressure potentials: - 100 hPa to - 166 MPa) in comparison with a reference treatment (REF). Surprisingly, soil compaction did not significantly affect the specific rupture energy of the aggregates. This was related to a clear difference in the stress-strain relationship for the soils. Aggregates from the compacted soil failed at higher stress but at lower strain than aggregates from the reference soil (i. e., higher Young modulus, (Y/()). This was characteristic for all size-classes and at all pressure potentials. The results obtained in this study indicate that the prediction of soil fragmentation from tensile strength properties of soil elements may be very complex. We need more basic understanding of the fragmentation of "unconfined" soil at the different size-scales (aggregates to bulk soil) and the correlation between the different scales in order to be able to predict soil fragmentation in tillage (mainly superficial tillage) from a priori information. More specifically, the role of soil biology and soil water and pore characteristics needs to be studied in further detail. The development of new methods and the application of well-know methods to quantify soil fragmentation and friability of soil at conditions similar to soil conditions at tillage (including water content) has been a primary aim in this thesis. However, there is still a strong need to develop new methods and modify existing methods to quantify soil fragmentation and friability under controlled conditions. This study shows that soil compaction and intensive tillage significantly influence soil fragmentation and friability. Increasingly heavier machinery and - to some extent - more intensive seedbed preparation (PTO-driven implements) are being used in Danish agriculture. A thorough evaluation of this development on soil fragmentation and friability is needed. Furthermore, the accumulated knowledge of soil fragmentation and tensile failure in soil ought to be implemented in the design of new tillage implements. ...|$|R
