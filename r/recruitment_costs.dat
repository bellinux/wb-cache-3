The direct cost captures cost directly associated with recruitment, such as e. g. advertising, interviewing etc, while the indirect cost capture di¤erences in marginal productivity due to recruitment. By making assumptions about the learning process I am able to present a <b>cost</b> function for <b>recruitment</b> that is static and dependent on number of persons that are to be recruited.

40|$|Introduction: The {{availability}} of rural healthcare {{is a growing}} concern in the United States as fewer healthcare providers choose to work in rural areas. Accessing quality continuing education (CE) for rural healthcare practitioners (HCPs) remains a challenge and may pose a barrier to quality care. Methods: To maximize attendance at a live, in-person, free CE program focusing on geriatric medication and issues specifically targeted to HCPs in rural areas, two methods were implemented sequentially. The first method used formal advertising implemented by a professional marketing service to promote CE events. The second method enlisted local healthcare organizations and physician groups to promote the CE event to their employees. Cost per attendee was calculated for comparison. Results: Professional marketing services recruited 31 HCPs (March 2011) and resulted in a per-participant <b>recruitment</b> <b>cost</b> of US$ 428. 62. Local healthcare organizations and physician groups’ marketing recruited 48 HCPs (July–August 2011) and resulted in a per-participant <b>recruitment</b> <b>cost</b> of US$ 55. 19. Discussion: Providing free CE coordinated through local healthcare organizations and physician groups was the most cost-effective method of recruiting rural HCPs for CE. Formal advertising added cost without increasing the number of participants per event. Although this is the first study of the cost-effectiveness of recruitment methods targeting HCPs in rural areas, results are consistent with research on cost-effectiveness of outreach to rural lay community members...|$|R

50|$|The Maldives is {{primarily}} a destination country for migrant workers from Bangladesh, and, to a lesser extent, India, {{some of whom are}} subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced labor. Some women are also subjected to forced prostitution. An unknown number of the 110,000 foreign workers currently working in the Maldives - primarily in the construction and service sectors - face fraudulent recruitment practices, confiscation of identity and travel documents, withholding or non-payment of wages, or debt bondage. Thirty thousand of these workers do not have legal status in the country, though both legal and illegal workers were vulnerable to conditions of forced labor. Diplomatic sources estimate that half of the 35,000 Bangladeshis in the Maldives went there illegally and that most of these workers are probably victims of trafficking. Migrant workers pay $1,000 to $4,000 in recruitment fees in order to migrate to the Maldives; such high <b>recruitment</b> <b>costs</b> increase workers’ vulnerability to forced labor, as concluded in a recent ILO report.|$|E

This study aims to describe the recruitment process and outcomes of 2 exercise interventions conducted in Shanghai, China. MethodsRecruitment information was ascertained from 2 community-based randomized controlled trials for 2 exercise interventions, the first designed to improve health outcomes for older women with knee osteoarthritis and the second to study changes in cognitive function in adults with mild cognitive impairment. Results were summarized in terms of recruitment sources, number screened, screening-to-enrollment ratios, and costs. ResultsRecruitment was primarily achieved through working with local residential divisions (i. e., neighborhood associations and residential committees). Both studies achieved their planned target number of older adults (45 and 46, respectively) within a 1 -year time frame, with a screening-to-randomized ratio of 5 : 1 and demonstrated excellent retention rates (range 87 %– 93 %) at 6 months. The <b>recruitment</b> <b>cost</b> for the 2 studies averaged RMB 189 (about USD 30) per initial recruit and RMB 738 (about USD 119) per participant randomized. Some major issues encountered during the recruitment process included (1) the use of community neighborhoods to support the conduct of the projects, (2) access to participants, and (3) feasibility.

40|$|This paper aims to {{document}} and analyse {{the use of}} fixed-term contracts (FTC) and to analyse the dynamics of labour adjustment by type of labour contract at the firm level, drawing on the detailed breakdown of both the labour force and labour entries and exits that {{are available in the}} "Belgian Firms' Social Balance Sheets" dataset. It also aims to investigate the structure of labour adjustment costs by type of labour contract, using the methodology proposed by Goux, Maurin and Pauchet (2001). Results first indicate that flexible labour contracts are not only used to facilitate short-term labour adjustment but also as a screening device. The findings also suggest that when a firm decides to introduce flexible labour into its production process, it does also this to meet long-run objectives such as implementing minimising costs innovations. It is further estimated that the introduction of FTCs does not seem to affect the speed of indefinite-term contracts (ITC) adjustment. Our results also tend to indicate that the FTC is a key adjustment variable in response to cost shocks and to unexpected demand fluctuations while, in response to expected fluctuations in output, firms then prefer to adjust their level of permanent employment. Finally, {{and as far as the}} structure of labour adjustment costs in Belgium is concerned, the marginal <b>recruitment</b> <b>cost</b> under an ITC represents 12. 4 % of the marginal termination cost of ITC, while the marginal cost associated with the recruitment under an FTC only accounts for 0. 8 % of its ITC counterpar...|$|R

This industry mainly based on domestic labour and major portion of cost includes in the textile garment product is labour cost. Due to increasing voluntary employee turnover the additional expenses beard by textile mill owners such as <b>recruitment</b> <b>cost,</b> overtime cost and training cost etc. now the employer keen to cut cost and increase production efficiency. According to Pfeiffer (2005) ‘’voluntary employee turnover is most studied outcome in organizational research’’ under discussion study will rotates around core issue of different reasons or factors effecting intensions of employee to leave the job. To address this issue couple of relevant theories and models {{has been used in}} literature to ascertain the theoretical knowledge and industry practices to determine the said problem and its rectifications. Organizational equilibrium theory, met expectancy theory, linkage model of turnover, unfolding model of turnover and Embeddedness theory have been studied in this regard and comparative analysis has done on bases of data gathering from the industry. In order to get unbiased response we have collected data from both sources primary and secondary. For primary data we design a web based questionnaire to get information from textile employees and also we conduct two interviews with HR Executives in selected companies to know about management perspective about VET.
