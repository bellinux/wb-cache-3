500|$|... "Green" [...] {{in modern}} European {{languages}} corresponds to about 520–570nm, but many historical and non-European languages make other choices, e.g. using {{a term for}} the range of ca. 450–530nm ("blue/green") and another for ca. 530–590nm ("green/yellow"). In the comparative study of color terms in the world's languages, green is only found as a separate category in languages with the fully developed range of six colors (white, black, red, green, yellow, and blue), or more rarely in systems with five colors (white, red, yellow, green, and black/blue). (See distinction of green from blue) These languages have introduced supplementary vocabulary to denote [...] "green", but these terms are recognizable as <b>recent</b> <b>adoptions</b> {{that are not in}} origin color terms (much like the English adjective [...] being in origin not a color term but the name of a fruit). Thus, the Thai word เขียว kheīyw, besides meaning [...] "green", also means [...] "rank" [...] and [...] "smelly" [...] and holds other unpleasant associations.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{his return}} to Newfoundland, Anderson became a strong proponent of {{daylight}} saving time and three times introduced a bill to the Legislative Council for its adoption. The first two attempts, in 1909 and 1910, failed. In 1917, spurred on perhaps by the <b>recent</b> <b>adoptions</b> of DST in Europe, Anderson introduced a third bill which passed on June 17, 1917. The new law stated that at nine o'clock in {{the evening of the}} second Sunday in June clocks would be put ahead to ten o'clock and would not be turned back until the last Sunday in September. It is not clear exactly when clocks were put ahead in 1917, as the bill became law one week after DST was scheduled to take effect. In St. John's DST was first applied on April 8, 1917 by virtue of a local ordinance. DST in Newfoundland {{came to be known as}} [...] "Anderson’s Time", at least in the years immediately following its adoption.|$|E

40|$|Many firms {{capitalize}} on their customers' social networks {{to improve the}} success rate of their new products. In this article, the authors analyze the dynamic effects of social influence and direct marketing on {{the adoption of a}} new high-technology product. Social influence is likely to play a role because the decision to adopt a high-involvement product requires extensive information gathering from various sources. The authors use call detail records to construct ego networks for a large sample of customers of a Dutch mobile telecommunications operator. Using a fractional polynomial hazard approach to model adoption timing and multiple social influence variables, they provide a fine-grained analysis of social influence. They show that the effect of social influence from cumulative adoptions in a customer's network decreases from the product introduction onward, whereas the influence of <b>recent</b> <b>adoptions</b> remains constant. The effect of direct marketing is also positive and decreases from the product introduction onward. This study provides new insights into the adoption of high-technology products by analyzing dynamic effects of social influence and direct marketing simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|Roughly {{eighty percent}} of U. S. {{building}} energy consumption is associated with end-uses covered by federal appliance standards that preempt states from adopting more efficacious standards. In the past twenty-five years, federal standards have achieved significant benefits; however, given the energy and climate challenges that we face today, federal standards often fall short on delivering the most cost-effective savings. Furthermore, despite <b>recent</b> <b>adoptions,</b> the Department of Energy’s history of rulemaking delays exacerbates the missed opportunity. Federal appliance standards also limit states or local governments from adopting innovated building codes (or “green codes”) that take us closer to reaching zero-net energy building goals. The most often stated reason for federal preemption is that it avoids an unworkable fifty-state patchwork of standards. This paper challenges that conclusion and outlines sensible strategies for modifying preemption law in ways that foster innovation and fuel energy efficiency. We present a detailed assessment of all major federal appliance standards and the incremental savings that could be achieved if more flexibility were integrated into the preemption law to allow regional optimization. We also outline how building codes could be simplified and made more effective with some changes to the preemption law. We then suggest policy changes {{that could lead to}} a more synergistic relationship between the federal government and states in the standards setting arena. These solutions would allow states or regions to innovate while also minimizing—or effectively avoiding—the “patchwork ” concern...|$|E
