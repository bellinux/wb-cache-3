5|$|The Stokes Mortar {{was rapidly}} {{developed}} {{when it became}} clear that some type of weapon was needed to provide artillery-like fire support to the infantry. The weapon was fully man-transportable yet also capable of firing reasonably powerful shells at targets beyond the range of <b>rifle</b> <b>grenades.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} {{company at}} this time had a nominal strength of 20 officers and 275 other ranks. Larger than a conventional infantry company, it was organised into three platoons, each of three sections, each of which contained two subsections. It had considerable firepower. Each subsection had a Bren light machine gun. The gunner's two assistants carried rifles and extra 30-round Bren magazines. A sniper also carried a rifle, as did one man equipped with <b>rifle</b> <b>grenades.</b> The remaining four or five men carried Owen submachine guns. Each platoon also had a section of 2-inch mortars.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the growing threat to the Australian base, the {{decision}} was made to reinforce FSB Andersen, with C Company, 3 RAR flown in by the time of the second attack two nights later. The APCs had also been redeployed to cover the south-east ridge and the southern approach from Trang Bom. The communist assault commenced just before midnight on 19 February, this time focussing on the south-east, and was preceded by heavy machine-gun fire. The attack was stopped short of the wire, regardless the forward pits were hit by <b>rifle</b> <b>grenades,</b> while the Assault Pioneer positions were attacked with satchel charges. The only casualties were four Viet Cong killed.|$|E
50|$|The Schiessbecher <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> {{launcher}} {{could be}} used against infantry, fortifications and light armored vehicles up {{to a range of}} 280 m. For these differing tasks several specialized grenades with accompanying special propelling cartridges were developed for the Schiessbecher <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> launchers. The <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> propelling cartridges fired a wooden projectile through the barrel to the <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> that upon impact automatically primed the <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Yugoslavia {{manufactured}} {{two types}} of <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade,</b> both with the nomenclature of M60. The M60 anti-personnel <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> bore a resemblance to the French M52 <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade.</b> The M60 anti-tank <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> bore a resemblance to the STRIM 65, also of French origin. It could penetrate 200mm of armour.|$|R
50|$|In 1942, an {{attachable}} <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> launcher {{called the}} Gewehrgranatengerät or Schiessbecher ("shooting cup") was introduced {{that was developed}} based on <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> launcher models designed during World War I. The 30 mm Schiessbecher cup-type <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> launcher could be mounted on any Karabiner 98k and was intended to replace all previous <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> launcher models. The <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> launcher could be used against infantry, fortifications and light armored vehicles up {{to a range of}} 280 m (306 yd). For these differing tasks, several specialized grenades with accompanying special propelling cartridges were developed for the 1,450,113 produced Schiessbecher <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> launchers. The <b>rifle</b> grenade-propelling cartridges fired a wooden projectile through the barrel to the <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> that, upon impact, automatically primed the <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade.</b> The Schiessbecher could be mounted on the Karabiner 98a, G98/40, StG 44 and FG 42.|$|R
5|$|Both {{factions in}} Day of Defeat: Source {{have access to}} six classes. Each class is {{designed}} with specific combat circumstances in mind, so that teams must use teamwork to succeed. The weapons and equipment carried by the classes {{are based on the}} weapons used by both the US Army and Wehrmacht during World War II. Some of classes are armed with pistols—the American M1911 or the German Walther P38—while others are equipped with trench knives or entrenching tools for melee combat. Grenades are carried by a number of classes, depending on their role in the game—riflemen are equipped with <b>rifle</b> <b>grenades,</b> the assault classes are armed with a single fragmentation grenade and a smoke grenade for providing concealment, while support classes have access to two standard fragmentation grenades. Riflemen are armed with the M1 Garand or the Karabiner 98 kurz and are designed for medium to long range combat, while the assault classes carries the M1 Thompson or the MP40 which are only effective in close quarters. The support classes are designed for medium range combat, equipped with either the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle or the StG44. Snipers are used for attacking enemy targets from long range, and are consequently armed with the Springfield M1903 or the Karabiner 98k both equipped with long range scopes. Machine gunners carries the M1919 Browning or the MG42 to defend key locations on a level or to provide a base of fire for their team's advance. Machine gunners are required to deploy their weapons on bipods before firing in order to compensate for the machine gun's extreme recoil. The final class is armed with a Bazooka or a Panzerschreck, used in the game to displace enemy machine gun or sniper positions. This class is armed with either an M1 carbine or Mauser M712 to defend themselves with when moving.|$|E

5000|$|The Grenade Projection Adapter was an {{expedient}} <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> {{used by the}} American Military in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. It {{consisted of}} an add-on 22mm stabilizer tube and fins that converted a hand-grenade into a <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade.</b> It was supplemented by the M17 <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade,</b> and eventually made obsolete by the 40 mm M79 grenade launcher.|$|R

25|$|The game's {{return to}} World War II-era warfare reintroduces weapons and technology. The player gains {{access to these}} {{over the course of}} the game, but may only carry up to two weapons in {{addition}} to hand grenades. Weapons and ammo from fallen foes or friendlies can be picked up to replace weapons in a player's arsenal. Players can also find weapons with additional attachments, including guns equipped with <b>rifle</b> <b>grenades,</b> telescopic sights, and bayonets.|$|E
25|$|Early {{production}} models were supplied with barrels that had six right-hand grooves and a 305mm (1:12 in) rifling twist (optimized {{for use with}} M193 ammunition), while recent {{production models}} feature a 178mm (1:7 in) twist barrel with six right-hand grooves (used to stabilize the heavier SS109/M855 projectile). The barrel has a slotted flash suppressor with 6 ports {{and can be used}} to launch <b>rifle</b> <b>grenades</b> (such as the BT/AT 52) or mount a bayonet lug attachment (it will accept the M7 bayonet).|$|E
25|$|The G36 {{employs a}} {{free-floating}} barrel (the barrel does not contact the handguard). The barrel is {{fastened to the}} receiver with a special nut, which can be removed with a wrench. The barrel is produced using a cold hammer forging process and features a chrome-lined bore with 6 right-hand grooves and a 1 in 178mm (1:7 in) rifling twist rate. The barrel assembly consists of the gas block, a collar with a bayonet lug that {{is also used to}} launch <b>rifle</b> <b>grenades</b> and a slotted flash suppressor.|$|E

25|$|These early prototypes, {{initially}} designated wz. 1981, were {{modeled on}} the Soviet 5.45mm AK-74 assault rifle and emphasized {{a high degree of}} parts commonality with the AKM rifle. As the weapon was intended to be able to launch <b>rifle</b> <b>grenades,</b> a newly designed, multi-functional muzzle device and a sturdier folding shoulder stock were used (the wire stock is a copy of the wire stock used on the East German MPi-KMS-72 rifle). Additionally, the wz. 81 was equipped with a mechanically limited burst fire mode, borrowed from the AKMS wz. 1980 prototype developed in the late 1970s by OBR.|$|E
25|$|Twenty {{minutes after}} the start of the battle, the communists {{attacked}} from the northeast, and contact was lost between the 3d Platoon and the company command. Captain Ulm theorized that the 3d Platoon and possibly the 2d Platoon would be flanked {{from the direction of the}} renewed attack and directed the 1st Platoon to move to the left flank of the 3d Platoon. As the men moved into position the entire company area was hit by small arms fire, <b>rifle</b> <b>grenades,</b> rockets, and 60-mm. mortar rounds. The firing was intense, but it resulted in few friendly casualties. The 2d Platoon moved to the right.|$|E
25|$|The Galil {{is fed from}} a curved, steel box {{magazine}} with a 35-round capacity (SAR and AR versions), a 50-round capacity (ARM model) or a special color-coded 12-round magazine blocked for use exclusively with ballistite (blank) cartridges, used to launch <b>rifle</b> <b>grenades.</b> The magazine is inserted front end first {{in a similar manner}} to the AK family. An optional magazine adaptor enables the use of M16 type STANAG magazines. Some who have used the Galil ARM with the 50-round magazine have noted {{that it is difficult to}} engage targets at elevated heights while firing on the ground in the prone position due to the magazine's extended length.|$|E
50|$|The Modèle 1952 34mm HE <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> was in French {{service from}} 1952 to 1978. It was used {{alongside}} the APAV40 <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> in French service. It was propelled by being mounted atop a <b>rifle's</b> 22 mm <b>grenade</b> launching adapter, and being launched by a ballistite (blank) cartridge.|$|R

25|$|In early 1916, the Germans {{had more}} and better {{equipment}} for trench warfare, with good quality hand grenades, <b>rifle</b> <b>grenades</b> and trench mortars; the Germans made more effort to repair and improve defences and with a homogeneous army, {{found it easier to}} move artillery, ammunition and men along the front. A substantial cadre of the pre-war trained officers and conscripts remained, to lead the wartime recruits. British tunnellers achieved an ascendancy over their German equivalents but in ground operations, the number of operational machine-guns and the volume and accuracy of artillery fire, had more effect than individual skill and bravery; the quantity of heavy guns often determined the course of engagements. The success of a local attack left the victors vulnerable to a counter-attack and captured positions were often more costly to hold, than the previous positions.|$|E
25|$|Training {{emphasised}} rapid advance, the silencing of machine-guns {{and maintaining}} {{communication with the}} artillery, to ensure that infantry and the creeping barrage moved together. Infantry were issued with light machine-guns, mortars and <b>rifle</b> <b>grenades</b> and intensively trained. Thirty divisions were trained in the new tactics but had a lower scale of equipment than the elite divisions and the remainder were stripped of material to supply them, giving up most of their remaining draught animals. In the north, two German armies would attack {{either side of the}} Flesquières salient, created during the Battle of Cambrai. The 18th Army, transferred from the Eastern Front, planned its attack either side of St. Quentin, to divide the British and French armies. The two northern armies would then attack the British position around Arras, before advancing north-west to cut off the BEF in Flanders. In the south, it was intended to reach the Somme and then hold the line of the river against any French counter-attacks; the southern advance was extended to include an advance across the Somme.|$|E
25|$|In early 1916, the Germans had an {{advantage}} in trench warfare equipment, being equipped with more and better hand grenades, <b>rifle</b> <b>grenades</b> and trench mortars. It was easier for the Germans to transfer troops, artillery and ammunition along the Western Front than the Franco-British, who had incompatible weapons and ammunition and a substantial cadre of German pre-war trained officers, NCOs and soldiers remained. The British wartime volunteers gained experience in minor tactics but success usually came from machine-guns and the accuracy and quantity of artillery support, not individual skill and bravery; in the air the RFC overcame the Fokker Scourge and underground, the BEF tunnellers overtook the Germans in technology and ambition. When the Bluff was captured, the British retook it; Mount Sorrel and Tor Top were retaken by the Canadians and British successes at St Eloi and Vimy Ridge were short-lived. Constant local fighting was costly but it enabled the mass of inexperienced British troops to gain experience, yet had the front been less densely occupied, more troops could have had more training; the wisdom of each policy was debated {{at the time and}} since.|$|E
50|$|During the Second World War, Nazi Germany {{developed}} and fielded a propaganda <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> (Propaganda-Gewehrgranate). It {{was designed for}} front-line troops to disperse propaganda leaflets via a <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> that, on impact, would disperse the printed material via a small ejecting charge.|$|R

25|$|In 1965, the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment, {{was sent}} to Singapore for jungle {{training}} {{in response to the}} threat of invasion from Indonesian President Sukarno. By March, the battalion was established along the Malaysia-Indonesia border in Borneo and conducting 10-day patrols in the jungle. On 27 April, 'B' Company's base on the hilltop village of Plamam Mapu, consisting of company headquarters, a mortar section, and one weak platoon of young soldiers, was attacked by 150 Indonesians supported by rocket launchers, mortars, <b>rifle</b> <b>grenades,</b> and machine guns from the surrounding hills. The accurate fire caused several casualties amongst the defenders. The Company Sergeant Major (CSM), John Williams, was in command of the defence. He kept moving around the base, attending to the wounded, reorganising the defenders to counter each attack, and firing illumination rounds from a 2-inch mortar. The Indonesians penetrated the wire, taking out a mortar position. CSM Williams crossed the open ground under fire to man a machine gun, which he used to engage the Indonesians inside the perimeter. Covered by the machine gun, the Paras counter-attacked and forced the Indonesians back. The Indonesians had located CSM Williams' machine gun, and in a second attack, it was subjected to heavy fire at point-blank range. Wounded and blinded in one eye, CSM Williams returned fire, defeating the second attack. He then led a fighting patrol to attack two groups of Indonesians seen approaching the base.|$|E
