25|$|Organs of {{exquisite}} {{tone and}} ornate appearance have {{become one of}} the outstanding features of motion picture houses and the management of Marion's new playhouse invested a huge sum in obtaining one of the best on the market. The organ is custom made being designed especially for the Marion theater. The size of the building and its acoustic properties were taken into consideration before any work was done on the musical instrument. Every bit of material going into the construction of the organ was carefully selected coming from many lands. Many weeks of work were necessary before the instrument was completed and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>install.</b> The heart of the organ rests in the switchboard. Keys operate silver and bronze contacts making instantaneous connections with the pipes and other effects. The pipes are cleverly concealed {{on each side of the}} stage, the opening forming double windows leading to balconies of two Spanish towers. The chambers form a natural part of the architecture of the interior. The console is the only part of the huge organ visible. It rests on a platform that can be raised and lowered bringing the console up to a point where it can be viewed to a great advantage all over the house or lowered to a point where it does not interfere with the view of the stage. The elevator is controlled by a motor located in a soundproof room back of the stage. The console itself is known as the Page Rainbo Gold deriving its name from the finish. It is heavily scrolled and so finished that lights are reflected in a very effective fashion.|$|E

2500|$|During the War of 1812, while President Madison was urging Federalists {{to join in}} [...] "united support" [...] against Britain in a war {{they were}} given little reason to {{cooperate}} in, he gave Henry Dearborn senior command of the northeast sector which ranged from the Niagara River to the New England coast. Dearborn had favor with Madison as a Revolutionary War veteran who rose {{to the rank of}} colonel and for serving as Secretary of War under President Jefferson, and especially for helping Jefferson draft the Military Peace Establishment Act, which served to remove many Federalist officers from the ranks of the military. Subsequently, Madison's choice for commanding general of the northeast theater was not well received by most Federalists. [...] At age 61, however, Dearborn was now overweight, slow and insecure, and he found it difficult to inspire confidence among the men under his command. In March he suffered a minor injury from a fall, and it is suggested that Dearborn took his time recovering. When the war broke out he spent even more time in Boston, fearing, as did Vice President Elbridge Gerry, that the Federalists were once again plotting a northeastern secession and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>install</b> a [...] "Hanoverian"-like monarchy in opposition to them.|$|E
6000|$|Gradually, out of {{the chaotic}} melee in which these titans were engaged had emerged one group more {{powerful}} than the rest and more respectable, whose leader was the Personality to whom I have before referred. He and his group had managed to gain control of certain conservative fortresses in various cities such as the Corn National Bank and the Ashuela Telephone Company--to mention two of many: Adolf Scherer was his ally, and the Boyne Iron Works, Limited, was soon to be merged by him into a greater corporation still. Leonard Dickinson might be called his local governor-general. We manned the parapets and kept our ears constantly to the ground to listen for the rumble of attacks; but sometimes they burst upon us fiercely and suddenly, without warning. Such was the assault on the Ashuela, which for years had exercised an apparently secure monopoly of the city's telephone service, which had been able to ignore with complacency the shrillest protests of unreasonable subscribers. Through the Pilot it was announced to the public that certain benevolent [...] "Eastern capitalists" [...] were ready to rescue them from their thraldom if the city would grant them a franchise. Mr. Lawler, the disinterestedness of whose newspaper could not be doubted, fanned the flame day by day, sent his reporters about the city gathering instances of the haughty neglect of the Ashuela, proclaiming its instruments antiquated compared with those used in more progressive cities, as compared with the very latest inventions which the Automatic Company was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>install</b> provided they could get their franchise. And the prices! These, too, would fall--under competition. It was a clever campaign. If the city would give them a franchise, that Automatic Company--so well named! would provide automatic instruments. Each subscriber, by means of a numerical disk, could call up any other, subscriber; there would be no central operator, no listening, no tapping of wires; the number of calls would be unlimited. As a proof of the confidence of these Eastern gentlemen in our city, they were willing to spend five millions, and present more than six hundred telephones free to the city departments! What was fairer, more generous than this! There could be no doubt that popular enthusiasm was enlisted in behalf of the [...] "Eastern Capitalists," [...] who were made to appear in the light of Crusaders ready to rescue a groaning people from the thrall of monopoly. The excitement approached that of a presidential election, and became the dominant topic at quick-lunch counters and in street-cars. Cheap and efficient service! Down with the Bastille of monopoly! ...|$|E

50|$|Lutf Allah {{was the son}} of Wajih ad-Din Mas'ud, {{the second}} leader of the Sarbadars, and was {{considered}} by Mas'ud's adherents to be his legitimate successor.

The situation for Lutf Allah improved when Haidar Qassib was murdered on the orders of Hasan Damghani. Hasan then had Lutf Allah proclaimed as formal sovereign of the Sarbadars.|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of fusion power is {{of paramount importance}} for the control of a fusion reactor's operation. The neutron yield from the reactor is strictly related to the energy production. One of the methods employed at JET to measure the yield involves the use of the MPRu spectrometer together with the neutron camera. However the MPRu has an intrinsically low efficiency (about 10 - 6), which results in a poor time resolution. An improvement involving the installation of a NE 213 detectorfor high count rate has been proposed. The testing phase of the new instrumentation, conducted at Uppsala University, has shown that the acquisition system works properly and it is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>installed</b> on site in view of the coming JET experimental campaign...|$|R
