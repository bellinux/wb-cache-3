5000|$|The {{radical change}} Franz Liszt's {{compositional}} style underwent {{in the last}} 20 {{years of his life}} was unprecedented in Western classical music. The tradition of music had been one of unified progression, even to the extent of Johannes Brahms' First Symphony being known as [...] "Beethoven's Tenth". Beethoven's own three periods of composition are monolithic and united. Liszt's, by comparison, seem deconstructivist. <b>Replacing</b> <b>pages</b> which in Liszt's earlier compositions had been thick with notes and virtuoso passages was a starkness where every note and rest was carefully weighed and calculated, while the works themselves become more experimental harmonically and formally.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis paper investigates {{the implementation of}} the page fault frequency (PFF) replacement algorithm as the mechanism for selecting and <b>replacing</b> <b>pages</b> of programs loaded into the main memory of a multiprocessing, multiprogrammed computer system. The frequency at which an executing program requires a page of virtual memory, the PFF, provides a basis for judging the real memory requirements of the program. Operating difficulties of PFF that reduce its usefulness in a time-shared computer system (Michigan Terminal System) are discussed, and a means of implementing the algorithm is proposed.

50|$|Page {{numbers in}} a {{shooting}} script are handled {{in a similar}} way. When revision pages are distributed, the page numbers must flow sequentially into the pre-existing page numbers.

These two <b>pages</b> will <b>replace</b> <b>page</b> 10 in the outstanding drafts. Conversely, if pages 15 and 16 are shortened such that they now occupy a single page, the revisions will be distributed on a single page numbered 15-16.|$|R

40|$|Development of {{efficient}} block replacement {{policy is}} the topic of much research in operating system as well as database management systems. Among variety of page replacement algorithms Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm is simple, flexible and has low overhead. LRU <b>replaces</b> <b>page</b> that is not accessed for longest time. But LRU makes bold assumption on recency factor only, which made LRU misbehave with weak locality workloads. This paper proposes a new Recency and Prior Probability (RPP) based page replacement policy for block replacement. The RPP combines recency and prior probability associated with the pages while selecting the victim frame from memory. If a page, to be used, has probability n times higher than another page, the page will get log(n) more chances {{to stay in the}} memory than lower probability pages. Hence with RPP, it is possible to prevent pages having higher probability of use from being replace...|$|R
