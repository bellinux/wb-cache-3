25|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem in}} the soft drinks industry {{was the lack of}} an effective sealing of the bottles. Carbonated drink bottles are under great pressure from the gas, so inventors tried to find the best way to prevent the carbon dioxide or bubbles from escaping. The bottles could also explode if the pressure was too great. Hiram Codd devised a patented bottling machine while working at a small mineral water works in the Caledonian Road, Islington, in London in 1870. His Codd-neck bottle was designed to enclose a marble and a <b>rubber</b> <b>washer</b> in the neck. The bottles were filled upside down, and pressure of the gas in the bottle forced the marble against the washer, sealing in the carbonation. The bottle was pinched into a special shape to provide a chamber into which the marble was pushed to open the bottle. This prevented the marble from blocking the neck as the drink was poured.|$|E
500|$|The {{cause of}} the cracks was a <b>rubber</b> <b>washer</b> which had been {{installed}} on the first eight trains—rather than the conventional plastic cover—which was intended to protect the axles from ice and stones. Adtranz had delivered thousands of trains with the conventional method without cracks, but the washers trapped water and this caused them to corrode and crack. Adtranz had applied a coat of paint as the sole means to avoid corrosion to the axle. The DNV inspector had [...] "hardly believed his ears" [...] {{when he heard about}} it. In addition, the axles were undersized, and DNV stated that it was only under duress that they considered it safe to operate the trains at conventional speeds, and that all the axles would have to be replaced. On 30 August, NSB gave Adtranz two weeks to solve the axle issues unless the contract was to be revoked.|$|E
50|$|Three major {{components}} of an aerator are: housing, insert and <b>rubber</b> <b>washer.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{reason for}} {{replacement}} of the <b>rubber</b> <b>washers</b> with the hytrel washers was that the <b>rubber</b> <b>washers</b> were not lasting for the full Periodic overhaul cycle of the Railway Coaches which was one year. The washers also had to be replaced in the coaching maintenance depots leading to lifting and lowering of coaches.|$|R
5000|$|As {{described}} above, the <b>rubber</b> <b>washers</b> sit {{directly on}} the axle box spring sitting area. Earlier,wooden washers were used. However, {{with the development of}} technology, <b>rubber</b> <b>washers</b> replaced wooden washers. Presently, RDSO, Lucknow which is a Research, Design & Standardization organization for the Indian Railways developed a new design for washers made from a polymer commonly known as HYTREL. Hytrel polymer is a product of M/s DuPont [...]|$|R
50|$|Introduction of Hytrel washers was {{considered}} a breakthrough in the ICF dashpot design. However, the mass scale replacement of the <b>rubber</b> <b>washers</b> by Hytrel washers without adequate trials lead to massive failure of the axle Box housing.|$|R
50|$|A <b>rubber</b> <b>washer</b> is a ring made {{of rubber}} used in {{mechanical}} devices. It {{is used to}} prevent vibration from spreading from one part to another, reducing the noise levels.|$|E
50|$|The system {{requires}} a seal between the yoke and valve to prevent leakage. This {{is called a}} Bodok seal, and is a moulded <b>rubber</b> <b>washer</b> (or Neoprene) supported by a metal rim.|$|E
50|$|The sticky shutter problem {{relates to}} a <b>rubber</b> <b>washer</b> which is {{involved}} in the operation of the shutter. With age and atmospheric conditions, it tends to deteriorate and become sticky, so that it impedes the operation of the shutter. Frequent use can delay the stickiness from 'glueing up' the shutter, but once started, the only long-term remedy is to have the shutter repaired, when the <b>rubber</b> <b>washer</b> is replaced, and so another 10 years or more can be enjoyed with the camera working correctly. A good short term solution is to lightly clean the shutter diaphragm with a cotton ball and lighter fluid.|$|E
50|$|A pedal {{operates}} {{shoes in}} enclosed drums {{at the rear}} and a centrally set hand lever applies a locomotive type of transmission brake which is anchored to the gear box. Hand adjusters are provided. Compensation is given by <b>rubber</b> <b>washers.</b> The rear-wheel brakes can also be taken up by hand on the primary rod.|$|R
5000|$|Another common {{feature of}} Alien Gear's {{holsters}} {{is the use}} of hex screws and crushable <b>rubber</b> <b>washers</b> to attach the retention shell to the holster. Many competing companies use rivets, which are non-adjustable. Belt clips on the inside-the-waistband holster were also made adjustable so the holster would ride at the height and tilt angle that customers preferred.|$|R
5000|$|The Elephant Pump, {{designed}} by Pump Aid {{based on a}} 3,000-year-old Chinese design, is built from rope, a plastic pipe, some <b>rubber</b> <b>washers,</b> and a winding wheel.The name [...] "Elephant Pump" [...] refers to the device's strength, shape, and reliability.The pump can lift water from depths of 30 m, and can produce 1 L of water per second.|$|R
5000|$|Hiram Codd (10 January 1838 [...] - [...] 18 February 1887) was an English engineer. In 1872, he {{patented}} {{a bottle}} filled under gas pressure which pushed a marble against a <b>rubber</b> <b>washer</b> in the neck, creating a perfect seal.|$|E
50|$|Economical {{globe valves}} or stop valves {{with a similar}} {{mechanism}} used in plumbing often have a <b>rubber</b> <b>washer</b> {{at the bottom of}} the disc for the seating surface, so that rubber can be compressed against the seat to form a leak-tight seal when shut.|$|E
50|$|A washer is a {{thin plate}} (typically disk-shaped) with a hole (typically in the middle) that is {{normally}} used to distribute the load of a threaded fastener, such as a screw or nut. Other uses are as a spacer, spring (belleville washer, wave washer), wear pad, preload indicating device, locking device, and to reduce vibration (<b>rubber</b> <b>washer).</b> Washers often have an outer diameter (OD) about twice their inner diameter (ID), but this can vary quite widely.|$|E
5000|$|One {{end of the}} tin {{case was}} fitted with a screw cap, with <b>rubber</b> <b>washers</b> to exclude water the other end being {{arranged}} with four short lengths of brass wire, soldered on {{the perimeter of the}} bottom, and spread out. When the cartridge was pushed home, the wires, by their elasticity, pressing {{against the side of the}} hole, prevented a falling-out.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} commercially {{available}} variations on this basic pattern, involving for example springs for looser suspension, hemispherical <b>rubber</b> <b>washers</b> for tighter suspension, or quick-release mechanisms {{in place of}} the nut. Some drummers replace the dome washer with a wooden washer or even a spherical or hemispherical wooden bead, with or without a bottom felt, to increase the sustain of the cymbal. The top felt may even be omitted for heavier cymbals mounted close to horizontal, also to increase sustain.|$|R
5000|$|Integral pumps have {{a hole in}} {{the side}} with a <b>rubber</b> <b>washer</b> that fits round the valve. This is {{frequently}} compressed on to the valve by an extra lever. Because it is well sealed, rigid and has little dead volume, this type of pump is very efficient. An 8" [...] integral will typically pump faster than an 18" [...] tubed. These type of pumps will run the risk of shredding the tube valves, especially on those with presta valves.|$|E
5000|$|Beverage bottles {{started using}} the Hutter Stopper in 1893. This {{involved}} a porcelain [...] {{fitted with a}} <b>rubber</b> <b>washer,</b> which was then forced down into {{the lip of the}} bottle. This technique only works with carbonated beverages. The Hutter Stopper became standard in beer bottling in the late 1890s / early 1900s. Bail closures on bottles were invented by Henry William Putnam in 1859. These involved heavy wire bail attached to a bottle's neck that swung over the cork to hold it in.|$|E
50|$|Metal, {{and some}} hard plastic valve caps have a rubber-washer seal (or a synthetic-rubber-washer seal) inside {{to help make}} a {{hermetic}} seal (airtight seal). The cap helps prevent air from escaping from a slightly leaking valve. In addition, the <b>rubber</b> <b>washer</b> prevents the cap from loosening and falling off due to vibrations and hence being lost, by acting as a cushion between the cap and the valve stem {{and in this way}} damping the vibrations, though most caps are a softer plastic making the need for a separate seal unnecessary.|$|E
50|$|The bolt {{consists}} of a heavy rod made of non-rusting alloys, such as stainless steel. It is held in position inside {{the barrel of the}} stunner by means of <b>rubber</b> <b>washers.</b> The bolt is usually not visible in a stunner in good condition. The bolt is actuated by a trigger pull and is propelled forward by compressed air or by the discharge of a blank round ignited by a firing pin. After striking a shallow but forceful blow on the forehead of the animal, spring tension causes the bolt to recoil back into the barrel.|$|R
50|$|Enclosed pole {{buildings}} have exterior curtain walls formed by girts {{fastened to the}} exterior of the posts at intervals about 2 ft on center that carry the siding and any interior load. The walls may be designed as a shear wall to provide structural stability. Other girt systems include framing in between the posts rather than on the outer side of the posts. Siding materials for a pole building are most commonly rolled-rib 29-gauge enameled steel cut to length in 32 or 36 in widths attached using color-matched screws with <b>rubber</b> <b>washers</b> to seal the holes. However, any standard siding can be used, including T1-11, vinyl, lap siding, cedar and even brick. Using sidings other than metal may require first installing sheathing, such plywood, oriented strand board or boards.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} whereby test fluids may {{be kept in}} contact with the skin {{of the back of the}} rat for 5 to 6 days. Methyl methacrylate chambers with hemispherical test domes were made and attached to <b>rubber</b> <b>washers</b> of larger diameter, which in turn were attached to the skin of the back of the rat using an alkyl cyanoacrylate (Eastman 910 adhesive). Each chamber had a removable stainless-steel screw to allow it to be filled and replenished with fluid as required. To prevent the rat gnawing the chambers from its back, twice weekly 4 mm was removed from the lower incisors and 1 -mm from the upper incisors, using a diamond disc in a dental handpiece. The young adult rats were fed a soft diet and after an initial temporary fall in weight, they moved about the cages in a normal manner...|$|R
5000|$|Tank Connectors {{are widely}} made of Plastic (PVC) or Brass, in many continents this {{connectors}} are {{also known as}} tank nipple as it has male threads, Tank connectors have a flange either {{on the edge of}} one side or in center to be jammed with tank wall, This connectors are also supplemented with <b>rubber</b> <b>washer</b> and sometime plastic washer with hexagonal flange nut, to tighten the connector with the tank wall. The size range of the connector varies from 1/2" [...] to 4", or the equivalent metric sizes, the size is denoted in the internal diameter of the connectors.|$|E
50|$|The bolster springs are {{supported}} on a lower spring beam. The lower spring beam is a fabricated structure {{made of steel}} plates. It is trapezoidal in shape with small steel tubes on each end. The location of the bolster spring seating is marked by two circular grooves in the center. A <b>rubber</b> <b>washer</b> is placed at the grooved section. The bolster spring sits on the <b>rubber</b> <b>washer.</b> The lower spring beam is also a free-floating structure. It is not bolted or welded either to the bogie frame or the bogie bolster. It {{is attached to the}} bogie frame on the outside {{with the help of a}} steel hanger. They are traditionally called the BSS Hangers (Bogie Secondary Suspension Hangers). A BSS pin is placed in the tubular section in the end portion of the lower spring beam. A hanger block is placed below the BSS pin. The BSS hanger in turn supports the hanger. This arrangement is done on all the four corners of the lower spring beam. The top end of the hanger also has a similar arrangement. However, instead of the BSS pin, steel brackets are welded on the lower side of the bogie frame of which the BSS hanger hangs with the help of hanger block. This arrangement is same for all the four top corners of the hangers. Hence, the lower spring beam also become a floating member hinged to the bogie frame with the help of hangers on the top and the bottom. This allows for the longitudinal movement of the lower spring beam.|$|E
5000|$|One {{common design}} is the [...] "rod squeegee", and {{consists}} of a hinge-mounted rubber disc {{on the end of}} a plastic rod of sufficient length to reach the full length of the barrel. The <b>rubber</b> <b>washer</b> end is inserted sideways into the barrel, pushed to the bottom and subsequently withdrawn with the rubber disc rotated ninety degrees (so that the disc now touches the inner circumference of the barrel and scrapes the paint out). Such designs often place the hinged disk on an inner cable or rod that is manipulated by a trigger at the other end; by pulling the trigger, the disk is forced to rotate into contact with the barrel surface.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an alternative to}} modal analysis to extract stiffness and damping parameters from thin vibrating plates. Full-field slope measurements are performed through a deflectometry technique on a plate vibrating at a given frequency. Images are recorded in phase and at ?/ 2 lag from the excitation. From this information, deflection fields are computed by integration and curvature fields are obtained by differentiation. This information is then input into the principle of virtual work to extract both stiffness and damping parameters. This procedure, known as the Virtual Fields Method, is detailed in the paper {{and the notion of}} special optimized virtual fields is extended to the present problem. Validation on simulated data is performed before moving to experimental data. One of the main advantages of this technique is that it is completely insensitive to the damping coming from the boundary conditions. This is illustrated experimentally on two tests where a viscoelastic layer and <b>rubber</b> <b>washers</b> are added in the experimental set u...|$|R

50|$|Through {{extensive}} {{trial and}} error, Charles and Ray arrived at an alternate solution: create two separate pieces {{for the seat}} and backrest, joined by a plywood spine and supported by plywood legs. The result was a chair with a sleek and honest appearance. All of the connections were visible and the material was not hidden beneath upholstery. The seat was joined to the spine and legs {{with a series of}} four heavy <b>rubber</b> <b>washers</b> with nuts embedded in them (later these came to be called 'shock mounts'). The shock mounts were glued to the underside of the seat, and screwed in through the bottom of the chair. The backrest was also attached using shock mounts. From the front and top the seat and back are uninterrupted by fasteners. The rubber mounts were pliable, allowing the backrest to flex and move with the sitter. This unique technology {{is also one of the}} chair's greatest flaws. The shock mounts are glued to the wooden backrest, but may tear free for various reasons. A common response to this problem was to drill directly through the backrest and insert fasteners between the backrest and the lumbar support. This greatly devalues the chair, since it changes the original aesthetic of smooth, uninterrupted wooden forms.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{screw-down}} tap mechanism was patented {{and manufactured}} by the Rotherham brass founders Guest and Chrimes in 1845. Most older taps use a soft rubber or neoprene washer which is screwed down onto a valve seat {{in order to}} stop the flow. This is called a [...] "globe valve" [...] in engineering and, while it gives a leak-proof seal and good fine adjustment of flow, both the <b>rubber</b> <b>washer</b> and the valve seat are subject to wear (and for the seat, also corrosion) over time, so that eventually no tight seal is formed in the closed position, resulting in a leaking tap. The washer can be replaced and the valve seat resurfaced (at least a few times), but globe valves are never maintenance-free.|$|E
50|$|The Eameses {{constantly}} {{made use}} of new materials. The pair's first plywood chair—the Eames Lounge Chair Wood (LCW)—{{made use of}} a heavy <b>rubber</b> <b>washer</b> glued to the backrest {{of the chair and}} screwed to the lumbar support. These washers, which have come to be called 'shock mounts', allow the backrest to flex slightly. This technology was brought back in the 670 Lounge chair. The backrest and headrest are screwed together by a pair of aluminum supports. This unit is suspended on the seat via two connection points in the armrests. The armrests are screwed to shock mounts which are connected only via glue to the interior of the backrest shell, allowing the backrest and headrest to flex when the chair is in use. This is part of the chair's unusual design, as well as its weakest link. The shock mounts have been known to tear free causing catastrophic collapse and damage.|$|E

50|$|In {{common with}} tanks of this period, but in {{contrast}} to crawler tractors, the suspension had considerable articulation and permitted high speeds. The Vigor was capable of nearly 10 mph, when the comparable Caterpillar D8 could only reach 5 mph. The four roadwheels were linked as two bogies on each side. Pairs of bogies on opposite side were linked by an articulated beam with a centre tilt pivot. This suspension required a flexible track and Vickers developed one with <b>rubber</b> sealing <b>washers</b> between the moving parts. This could be a drawback, as wear to the rubber in service could make the track floppy. Together with the great suspension articulation, if not well-maintained, the Vigor could be prone to throwing tracks when run at speed.|$|R
40|$|Inexpensive device {{developed}} that eliminates tipping problem without affecting crushing process. Device consists of soft sponge-rubber insert approximately 0. 5 inches (1. 3 centimeters) thick, cut to same diameter as internal diameter of tube specimen. Metal washer, slightly smaller than internal diameter of tube, placed {{on top of}} rubber insert. Screw passed through <b>washer</b> and <b>rubber</b> insert and threaded into base of test machine. As screw tightened against <b>washer,</b> <b>rubber</b> insert compressed and expands radially. Radial expansion applies pressure against internal wall of tube specimen, which provides sufficient support to tube to prevent tipping...|$|R
5000|$|Each {{male end}} of a typical garden hose can mate with the female {{connector}} on another, which allows multiple garden hoses to be linked end-to-end to increase their overall length. Small <b>rubber</b> or plastic <b>washers</b> (often confusingly called [...] "hose washers") are used in female ends to prevent leakage, because the threads are not tapered and {{are not used to}} create a seal. Sometimes the gaskets stiffen, disintegrate, or fall out of older hoses, which results in pressurized leakage spraying from the hose; simply replacing the washer insert often fixes the problem.|$|R
