25|$|Ten {{counties}} {{competed in}} the 2013 Leinster championship; however, the CCCC proposal decreased the Leinster competition to a field of five regulars, namely Kilkenny, Dublin, Wexford, Offaly and Galway, alongside two more from a round-robin qualifying group featuring Laois, Westmeath, Carlow, London and Antrim. These five teams each played four games, with the top two qualifying for the Leinster Championship quarter-finals. The fourth-placed team met {{the winner of the}} Christy <b>Ring</b> <b>Cup</b> in a promotion/relegation play-off. The bottom county faced automatic relegation to the Christy <b>Ring</b> <b>Cup.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{the county}} {{won the first}} Christy <b>Ring</b> <b>Cup</b> and thereby gained {{promotion}} to the 2006 Liam McCarthy Championship. In 2006, they beat Dublin {{in the first round}} of the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship before losing the semi final to Kilkenny in Mullingar by 14 points. They then lost to Waterford, Galway and, disappointingly, Laois before tamely losing a relegation playoff against Dublin on a scorching July day in Tullamore. Despite progress made in 2006, the GAA condemned the county's hurlers to the Christy <b>Ring</b> <b>Cup</b> - this time without the prospect of promotion. Further rule changes and a Christy Ring win in 2010 allowed Westmeath back into the 2011 Liam McCarthy.|$|E

They won the 2011 Lory Meagher Cup, and then the 2013 Nicky Rackard Cup, their first, beating Roscommon in the final by 4 points. These games were all played at Croke Park.|$|E

25|$|Hurling {{was brought}} to Britain by Irish {{immigrants}} in the 19th century. The game is administered by British GAA. Warwickshire and Lancashire compete at inter-county level in the Lory Meagher Cup, competing against other counties in Ireland. London is the only non-Irish team to have won the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (having captured the title in 1901), and after winning the 2012 Christy <b>Ring</b> <b>Cup</b> gained the right to contest the Liam MacCarthy Cup in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Kerry {{is known}} for its senior Gaelic {{football}} team. Gaelic football is by far the dominant sport in the county, and Kerry has the most successful of all football teams; the Kerry footballers have won the Sam Maguire cup 37 times, with the next nearest team Dublin on 24 wins. Hurling is popular at club level in north Kerry, although the county has only won one All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, in 1891. The senior team currently compete in the Christy <b>Ring</b> <b>Cup.</b>|$|E
25|$|As hurling {{entered the}} new millennium, it has {{remained}} Ireland's second most popular sport. An extended qualifier system resulted in a longer All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, but Cork, Tipperary and Kilkenny have come to dominate the championship and some argue that the All-Ireland has become less competitive. Pay-for-play remains controversial and the Gaelic Players Association continues to grow in strength. The inauguration of the Christy <b>Ring</b> <b>Cup</b> and Nicky Rackard Cup gave new championships {{and an opportunity to}} play in Croke Park to the weaker county teams. Further dissemination of the championship structure was completed in 2009 with the addition of the Lory Meagher Cup to make it a four tier championship.|$|E

2500|$|The {{advent of}} the Christy <b>Ring</b> <b>Cup</b> has seen Kerry become very competitive. They first made the semi-finals in 2009 where they lost out to Carlow after a replay.

50|$|These ferns {{are called}} leptosporangiate because their sporangia arise {{from a single}} {{epidermal}} cell and not {{from a group of}} cells as in eusporangiate ferns (a polyphyletic lineage).

Many leptosporangiate ferns have an annulus around the sporangium, which ejects the spores.|$|R
