5|$|Concerns {{continued}} to be <b>raised</b> <b>that</b> the blockhouse's guns could not fire downriver and by the 1830s it had been decided to focus investment on the New Tavern and Tilbury forts. The blockhouse itself fell out of use as a magazine in 1834, being briefly used as a government store, and the adjacent gun platforms were sold off in 1835. The blockhouse building was subsequently demolished in 1844.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{had been}} <b>raised</b> <b>that</b> the {{radiation}} belt produced in orbit {{by the recent}} Operation Dominic nuclear tests would be dangerous to manned space missions, but an extensive study announced in early September declared that {{it was safe to}} fly. While the outside of the capsule was expected to receive a dosage of around 500 röntgens, the study concluded that shielding and the effect of the spacecraft structure would reduce this to around 8 röntgens experienced by the astronaut, well within established tolerance limits.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1995, the Pyxis {{globular}} cluster is a 13.3 ± 1.3 billion year-old {{globular cluster}} situated around 130,000 light-years distant from Earth and around 133,000 light-years {{distant from the}} centre of the Milky Way—a region not previously thought to contain globular clusters. Located in the galactic halo, it was noted to lie on the same plane as the Large Magellanic Cloud and the possibility has been <b>raised</b> <b>that</b> it might be an escaped object from that galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{has been}} used for bullets since their {{invention}} in the Middle Ages. It is inexpensive; its low melting point means small arms ammunition and shotgun pellets can be cast with minimal technical equipment; and it is denser than other common metals, which allows for better retention of velocity. Concerns have been <b>raised</b> <b>that</b> lead bullets used for hunting can damage the environment.|$|E
5|$|After these slights, {{speculation}} was <b>raised</b> <b>that</b> Mathias {{would leave}} the Republican Party, especially as the 1980 elections were approaching. Several prominent conservatives in the state, such as U.S. Representatives Marjorie Holt and Robert Bauman, were considering challenging Mathias for his seat. In contrast, the Democratic {{side of the aisle}} had fewer challengers, suggesting Mathias would win renomination more easily if he were to switch parties. However, Mathias chose to remain as a Republican, and teamed up with eight other Republican senators to express their dissatisfaction with the hard-line wing of the party. Mathias later stated that he had never seriously considered switching parties.|$|E
5|$|Coropuna is drained by deep gorges, {{with water}} {{eventually}} reaching the Arma and Majes rivers, {{both of which}} empty into the Pacific Ocean. During the dry season, Coropuna's glaciers are {{a major source of}} water for the region, and concern has been <b>raised</b> <b>that</b> their disappearance may result in water shortages at a time when population growth has increased water consumption and begun to create conflict over water distribution. 30,000 people depend on the Coropuna glacier in one way or the other, 8,000 of them just for their water supply.|$|E

5|$|During battle, players cast spells {{using an}} {{assigned}} Persona: each spell drains a character's Spell Point meter. Each Persona has different elemental strengths and weaknesses, and different Personas {{can be used}} for defense, healing or elemental attacks. While a Persona is originally quite weak, if it is used enough, it will achieve a higher rank, with Rank 8 being the highest possible. As the Persona's rank is <b>raised,</b> <b>that</b> Persona is able to cast more powerful spells. In addition to individual actions, the player can align characters to trigger a Fusion Spell: when two or more party members use a certain sequence of spells, they will automatically summon multiple Personas to generate a powerful attack. During battles, both characters and Personas earn experience points. The player has the option to activate an Auto-battle option, having combat play out without player interaction.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz {{was charged}} with trying to hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan in {{retaliation}} for the murder of her father. Farrakhan surprised the Shabazz family when he defended Qubilah, saying he did not think she was guilty and that he hoped she would not be convicted. That May, Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah's legal defense. Some heralded the evening as a reconciliation between the two, but others thought Shabazz was doing whatever she had to in order to protect her daughter. Regardless, nearly $250,000 was <b>raised</b> <b>that</b> evening. In the aftermath, Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan, although she agreed to speak at his Million Man March that October.|$|E
5|$|Melting of {{floating}} ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) {{does not in}} itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been <b>raised</b> <b>that</b> disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.|$|E

5|$|Some {{concerns}} were <b>raised</b> <b>that</b> the Gemini spacecraft's heat shield {{would not have}} been able to protect it during the higher speed ballistic reentry associated with the trajectory that would have been required. NASA proposed using a thicker heat shield and more insulation to protect the spacecraft. This and several other modifications made the spacecraft too heavy to be launched by the Titan II rocket which was used for the original twelve Gemini missions, so several solid rocket motors would have been added to allow this additional mass to be flown.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not <b>raised,</b> <b>that</b> increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E
5|$|Following his defeat, Cooper resumed the {{practice}} of law in the Washington, D.C. firm of Gardner, Morison and Rogers. In 1949, President Truman appointed Cooper as one of five delegates to the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly. He was an alternate delegate to that body in 1950 and 1951. Secretary of State Dean Acheson chose Cooper as his advisor to meetings that created the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and at meetings of the NATO Council of Ministers in London in May 1950 and Brussels in December 1950. Political historian Glenn Finch observed that, while Cooper was well-qualified for his duties at the U.N. and NATO, his presence abroad also made him less available to campaign for the Senate seat vacated by Barkley's elevation to the vice-presidency. Speculation was <b>raised</b> <b>that</b> Clements, who won Barkley's old seat in a special election in 1950, may have influenced Truman and Acheson to make the appointments.|$|E

5|$|Parsons {{filed an}} appeal disputing the {{constitutionality}} of his first-degree murder conviction with the Utah Supreme Court. His attorney argued that Parsons had already been convicted of another charge for the crime, making his murder conviction a violation of double jeopardy. On October 16, 1989, the court unanimously upheld the conviction and rejected his appeal {{on the grounds that}} Parsons should have <b>raised</b> <b>that</b> objection before he waived his right to a trial with his guilty plea. On March 5, 1990, District Judge J. Philip Eves rejected Parsons' complaint that he was denied his right to legal counsel while in prison and set his execution date for April 30, 1990. A new team of attorneys, which included Gregory Sanders and Ronald Yengich of the Rocky Mountain Defense Fund, took up Parsons' appeal that he had ineffective counsel during his trial. On January 12, 1994, the Utah Supreme Court rejected Parsons' petition for a writ of habeas corpus.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the middle}} of 24s run, the series {{attracted}} significant criticism for its depictions of torture, {{as well as its}} negative portrayal of Muslims. The frequent use of ticking time bomb scenarios in storylines, as well as the main character, Jack Bauer portraying torture as normal, effective, acceptable and glamorous, was criticized by human rights activists, military officials, and experts in questioning and interrogation, with concerns <b>raised</b> <b>that</b> junior U.S. soldiers were imitating techniques shown on the series. In response to these concerns, members of the U.S. military met with the creators of the show. Partly {{as a result of these}} discussions, and the military's appeal to the creators of the show to tone down the scenes of torture since it was having an impact on U.S. troops, there was a reduction in torture in subsequent seasons of the series. However, the writers stated that they reduced the number of torture scenes, not as a concession, but because it was starting to overwhelm the storytelling.|$|E
