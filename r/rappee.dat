6000|$|... 'Why, it IS difficult, sir, I confess,' {{said the}} tall footman. 'It may {{be done by}} degrees, Sir. Coffee is the best practice. I carried coffee, Sir, for a long time. It looks very like <b>rappee,</b> sir.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here," [...] said Des Cadoux, with a grimace, [...] "endeth {{the chapter}} of our lives. I wonder, do they keep <b>rappee</b> in heaven?" [...] He snapped down {{the lid of}} his gold snuffbox--that {{faithful}} companion and consoler of so many years--and cast it viciously {{at the head of}} one of the oncoming peasants. Then tossing back the lace from his wrist he brought his sword into guard and turned aside a murderous stroke which an assailant aimed at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Troth, ye may swear that, Monkbarns: when it {{was mine}} it neer had abune the like o' saxpenny worth o' black <b>rappee</b> in't at ance. But I reckon ye'll be gaun to mak an antic o't, as ye hae dune wi' mony an orra thing besides.

6000|$|... "For ourselves," [...] he {{concluded}} calmly, tapping his gold snuffbox and holding {{it out to}} Bellecour, {{for all the world}} with the air of one who was discussing the latest fashion in wigs, [...] "I can understand your repugnance at coming to blows with this obscene canaille. It is doing them an honour of which they are not worthy. But we have these ladies to think of, Messieurs, and--" [...] he paused to apply the <b>rappee</b> to his nostrils--"and we must exert ourselves to save them, however disagreeable the course we may be compelled to pursue. Messieurs, I am the oldest here; permit that I show you the way." ...|$|E
6000|$|This did {{not quite}} satisfy the {{penetrating}} mistress of the Thistle. Searching as her own small <b>rappee,</b> she, {{in spite of her}} promise, urged Jeanie with still farther questions. [...] "Had she been a' that time at Argyle House? Was the Duke with her the whole time? and had she seen the Duchess? and had she seen the young ladies--and specially Lady Caroline Campbell?"--To these questions Jeanie gave the general reply, that she knew so little of the town that she could not tell exactly where she had been; that she had not seen the Duchess to her knowledge; that she had seen two ladies, one of whom, she understood, bore the name of Caroline; and more, she said, she could not tell about the matter.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the general}} start and exclamation which {{followed}} this annunciation, Mr. Oldbuck dropped his snuff-box; and the Scottish <b>rappee,</b> which dispersed itself in consequence, had effects upon the nasal organs of our reporter, ensconced {{as he was}} under the secretary's table, which occasioned his being discovered and extruded in the illiberal and unhandsome manner we have mentioned, with threats of farther damage to his nose, ears, and other portions of his body, on the part especially of Captain Clutterbuck. Undismayed by these threats, which indeed those of his profession are accustomed to hold at defiance, our young man hovered about {{the door of the}} tavern, but could only bring us the farther intelligence, that the meeting had broken up in about {{a quarter of an hour}} after his expulsion, [...] "in much-admired disorder." ...|$|E
6000|$|Here Mr. Sterne was {{interrupted}} by a monk of the Order of St. Francis, who stepped into the room, and begged us all to take a pinch of his famous old <b>rappee.</b> I suppose the snuff was very pungent, for, with a great start, I woke up; and now perceived that I must have been dreaming altogether. [...] "Dessein's" [...] of now-a-days is not the [...] "Dessein's" [...] which Mr. Sterne, and Mr. Brummell, and I recollect in the good old times. The town of Calais has bought the old hotel, and [...] "Dessein" [...] has gone over to [...] "Quillacq's." [...] And I was there yesterday. And I remember old diligences, and old postilions in pigtails and jack-boots, who were once as alive as I am, and whose cracking whips I have heard in the midnight many and many a time. Now, where are they? Behold they have been ferried over Styx, and have passed away into limbo.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{he set his}} virtues {{against his}} vices, and struck an even balance between them. When most {{unsteady}} upon his legs he most asserted his integrity, declaring that not a gill or a thread came into his port without paying its duty, and calling Heaven to witness {{that it had been}} his hand that had saved the life of a noble young gentleman. Thereupon, perhaps, drawing forth the gleaming token of his prowess--the gold snuffbox--from his breeches-pocket, and holding it tight in his brown and hairy fist, he would first offer his interlocutor a pinch of <b>rappee,</b> and would then call upon him to read the inscription engraved upon the lid of the case, demanding to know whether it mattered a fig if a man did drink a drop too much now and then, provided he collected every farthing of the royal revenues, and had been the means of saving the son of the Earl of Clandennie.|$|E

60|$|Well, I came to London, and so {{carefully}} avoided smoking that I {{would not even}} go into Hudson's shop to pay his bill, and as smoking was not the fashion then among young men as (thank heaven!) it is now, I had not many temptations from my friends' examples in my clubs or elsewhere; only little Dawdley began to smoke, as if to spite me. He had never done so before, but confessed--the rascal!--that he enjoyed a cigar now, if it were but to mortify me. But I took to other and more dangerous excitements, and upon the nights when not in attendance upon Mary M'Alister, might be found in very dangerous proximity to a polished mahogany table, round which claret-bottles circulated a great deal too often, or worse still, to a table covered with green cloth and ornamented {{with a couple of}} wax-candles and a couple of packs of cards, and four gentlemen playing the enticing game of whist. Likewise, I came to carry a snuff-box, and to consume in secret huge quantities of <b>rappee.</b>|$|E
6000|$|To {{me there}} is {{something}} very touching {{in the notion of}} that little pinch of comfort doled out to granny, and gratefully inhaled by her in the darkness. Don't you remember what traditions there used to be of chests of plate, bulses of diamonds, laces of inestimable value, sent out of the country privately by the old Queen, to enrich certain relations in M-ckl-nb-rg Str-l-tz? Not all the treasure went. Non omnis moritur. A poor old palsied thing at midnight is made happy sometimes as she lifts her shaking old hand to her nose. Gliding noiselessly among the beds where lie the poor creatures huddled in their cheerless dormitory, I fancy an old ghost with a snuff-box that does not creak. [...] "There, Goody, take of my <b>rappee.</b> You will not sneeze, and I shall not say 'God bless you.' But you will think kindly of old Queen Charlotte, won't you? Ah! I had a many troubles, a many troubles. I was a prisoner almost so much as you are. I had to eat boiled mutton every day: entre nous, I abominated it. But I never complained. I swallowed it. I made the best of a hard life. We have all our burdens to bear. But hark! I hear the cock-crow, and snuff the morning air." [...] And with this the royal ghost vanishes up the chimney--if there be a chimney in that dismal harem, where poor old Twoshoes and her companions pass their nights--their dreary nights, their restless nights, their cold long nights, shared in what glum companionship, illumined by what a feeble taper! ...|$|E

60|$|Of Dinmont, who, {{with his}} large hunting-whip under his arm, stood poking his great round face over the {{shoulder}} of the homme d'affaires, it is unnecessary to say anything. That thin-looking oldish person, in a most correct and gentleman-like suit of mourning, is Mac-Casquil, formerly of Drumquag, who was ruined by having a legacy bequeathed to him of two shares in the Ayr bank. His hopes on the present occasion are founded on a very distant relationship, upon his sitting in the same pew with the deceased every Sunday, and upon his playing at cribbage with her regularly on the Saturday evenings, taking great care never to come off a winner. That other coarse-looking man, wearing his own greasy hair tied in a leathern cue more greasy still, is a tobacconist, a relation of Mrs. Bertram's mother, who, having a good stock in trade when the colonial war broke out, trebled the price of his commodity to all the world, Mrs. Bertram alone excepted, whose tortoise-shell snuff-box was weekly filled with the best <b>rappee</b> at the old prices, because the maid brought it to the shop with Mrs. Bertram's respects to her cousin Mr. Quid. That young fellow, who has not had the decency to put off his boots and buckskins, might have stood as forward as most of them in the graces of the old lady, who loved to look upon a comely young man; but it is thought he has forfeited the moment of fortune by sometimes neglecting her tea-table when solemnly invited, sometimes appearing there when he had been dining with blyther company, twice treading upon her cat's tail, and once affronting her parrot.|$|E
6000|$|The {{collection}} {{was indeed a}} curious one, and might well be envied by an amateur. Yet it was not collected at the enormous prices of modern times, which are sufficient to have appalled the most determined as well as earliest bibliomaniac upon record, whom we take to have been none else than the renowned Don Quixote de la Mancha, as, among other slight indications of an infirm understanding, he is stated, by his veracious historian, Cid Hamet Benengeli, to have exchanged fields and farms for folios and quartos of chivalry. In this species of exploit, the good knight-errant has been imitated by lords, knights, and squires of our own day, though {{we have not yet}} heard of any that has mistaken an inn for a castle, or laid his lance in rest against a windmill. Mr. Oldbuck did not follow these collectors in such excess of expenditure; but, taking a pleasure in the personal labour of forming his library, saved his purse at the expense of his time and toil, He was no encourager of that ingenious race of peripatetic middle-men, who, trafficking between the obscure keeper of a stall and the eager amateur, make their profit at once of the ignorance of the former, and the dear-bought skill and taste of the latter. When such were mentioned in his hearing, he seldom failed to point out how necessary it was to arrest the object of your curiosity in its first transit, and to tell his favourite story of Snuffy Davie and Caxton's Game at Chess.--"Davy Wilson," [...] he said, [...] "commonly called Snuffy Davy, from his inveterate addiction to black <b>rappee,</b> was the very prince of scouts for searching blind alleys, cellars, and stalls for rare volumes. He had the scent of a slow-hound, sir, and the snap of a bull-dog. He would detect you an old black-letter ballad among the leaves of a law-paper, and find an editio princeps under the mask of a school Corderius. Snuffy Davy bought the Game of Chess, 1474, the first book ever printed in England, from a stall in Holland, for about two groschen, or twopence of our money. He sold it to Osborne for twenty pounds, and as many books as came to twenty pounds more. Osborne resold this inimitable windfall to Dr. Askew for sixty guineas. At Dr. Askew's sale," [...] continued the old gentleman, kindling as he spoke, [...] "this inestimable treasure blazed forth in its full value, and was purchased by Royalty itself for one hundred and seventy pounds!--Could a copy now occur, Lord only knows," [...] he ejaculated, with a deep sigh and lifted-up hands--"Lord only knows what would be its ransom; and yet it was originally secured, by skill and research, for the easy equivalent of two-pence sterling. * Happy, thrice happy, Snuffy Davie!--and blessed were the times when thy industry could be so rewarded! ...|$|E

40|$|Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) presents {{a number of}} symptoms and adjustment issues for individual children and adolescents, {{but it is also}} associatedwith amyriadof risks for the larger family system. Anexaminationof PTSD froma systemic perspective is crucial to comprehending the development andmaintenance of PTSD. For example, a close relationshipwith a supportive adult enables a child to separate from a traumatic event and successfully persevere in the future. This article reviews the need for a systemic family perspective, including a narrative therapy approach, when considering the development, maintenance, prevention, and resolution of PTSD in children and adolescents. Keywords posttraumatic {{stress disorder}}, family systems therapy, narrative family therapy, children and adolescents Family functioning has a substantial impact on the develop-ment, expression, and maintenance of psychopathology in chil-dren and adolescents. Family systems theories have informed etiological and therapeutic perspectives for various psycho-pathologies including depression (Crethar, Snow, & Carlson, 2004), anxiety (Barrett, Dadds, & <b>Rappee,</b> 1996), anorexia ner-vosa (Killian, 1994), attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (Cunningham, 1998), conduct disorder (Keiley & Seery, 2001), substance abuse (Cottrell & Boston, 2002), schizophre-nia (Torgalsboen & Rund, 1998), and bipolar disorder (Mueser, 2001). Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) also presents a number of symptoms and adjustment issues for the individual child {{as well as for the}} larger family system. Yet, clinically sys-temic investigations of PTSD have primarily relied on samples composed of individual adults or couples (e. g., Monson, Rodri-guez, & Warner, 2005). For the most part, discussion of the impact of an individual PTSD diagnosis on both the children and the larger family system has been limited to footnotes. This lack of attention is especially troubling in light of Prince (2005), who found family involvement to be an essential com-ponent in both the assessment and the planning of treatment, as well as a strong predictor of later family satisfaction with treat-ment outcomes. It has been estimated that approximately one in four children will experience a traumatic event before the age of 16 (Th...|$|E
