This meant that the majority of organisations that work with children or young people e.g. sports groups, uniformed groups and faith groups, would not be able to register their involvement, representing a <b>real</b> <b>challenge</b> for practitioners who wanted to see who was working with a particular child or young person.|$|E

25|$|The first <b>real</b> <b>challenge</b> to Tobin's {{leadership}} of the Teamsters also came in 1940. The Teamsters paid Tobin a salary of $30,000 that year, when the large union had only 450,000 members. But despite the financial encomium, dissident members of the union {{accused him of being}} a dictator over the union's affairs. Tobin angrily denied the charges. Over the next year, however, Tobin cracked down on dissidents and trusteed several large locals led by his political opponents.|$|E

There is a full season of Contessa 32 'one design' racing, {{including}} Inshore Series, National Championships, Cowes Week, Offshore and Round The Island races. Contessa 32s perform very well under the IRC handicap system, and provide a <b>real</b> <b>challenge</b> to modern racing yachts, often being placed highly in races such as the Round the Island Race and the Fastnet Race. The Rogers own yacht, Calypso, finished 12th in the 2011 Round the Island Race.|$|E

The start of the international season saw England defeat Bangladesh 2–0 in their two-match series, winning both Tests by an innings. This was followed by a tri-nations one-day tournament that also featured Australia. However, all eyes were on the Ashes. Australia still started as favourites, but England, {{for the first time in}} years, were expected to put up a <b>real</b> <b>challenge</b> to Aussie supremacy.|$|E

This is seen especially in the paddy fields carpeting the rolling lower slopes of the Hoàng Liên Mountains.

On a clear day, the imposing peak of Fan Si Pan comes into view.

25|$|Meles {{encountered}} {{his first}} <b>real</b> <b>challenge</b> in the 2005 elections. His party was declared winner {{and kept his}} prime minister seat for another term, although the major opposition groups (the Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD), UEDF, and the Oromo Federalist Democratic Movement) gained a number of seats in the national parliament. More than 30 other political parties participated in the election. These elections were the most contested and the most controversial in Ethiopia's short democratic history, with some opposition parties arguing that the election was stolen by the ruling party. Allegations of fraud were especially strong in the rural areas, as the opposition parties won in most urban areas, whereas the EPRDF won mostly in rural districts.|$|E
25|$|After Kenya gained {{independence}} on 12 December 1963, Kenyatta convinced Moi that KADU and KANU {{should be}} merged {{to complete the}} process of decolonisation. Accordingly, KADU dissolved and joined KANU in 1964. The only <b>real</b> <b>challenge</b> to KANU's dominance came from the Kenya People's Union, starting in 1966. That party was banned in 1969, and from that point onward Kenya was a de facto one-party state dominated by the Kĩkũyũ-Luo alliance. However, {{with an eye on}} the fertile lands of the Rift Valley populated by members of Moi's Kalenjin tribe, Kenyatta secured their support by first promoting Moi to Minister for Home Affairs in 1964, and then to Vice-President in 1967. As a member of a minority tribe Moi was also an acceptable compromise for the major tribes. Moi was elected to the Kenyan parliament in 1963 from Baringo North. From 1966 until his retirement in 2002 he served as the Baringo Central MP.|$|E

25|$|In 1854, {{the first}} {{cracks in the}} state Democratic Party began to show {{after the passage of}} the Kansas-Nebraska Act by Congress. Bright and his faction, a {{majority}} of the party, began forcing out anti-slavery members of the party leadership, using support of the act as a litmus test of party loyalty. By then the national debate over the possible break-up of the Union had begun. The Whig party was also on the brink of collapse, and a new coalition party of former Whigs, former Democrats, the anti-immigration Free Soil party, and the anti-slavery Liberty Party came together. The result was the so-called Know-Nothing Party and the first <b>real</b> <b>challenge</b> to Democrat control of the state in a generation. The 1854 mid-term election caused the Democrats to lose seats in the Senate, but still maintain control. The Democrats did, however, lose their majority in the house. The House was spilt with no party attaining majority, and the Whigs caucused with the Democrats to control the assembly. The effect was a virtual paralysis to the legislature, and Wright was unable to make any significant accomplishments during his last two years in office.|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} ongoing {{research}} in extensible kernels largely fails {{to address the}} <b>real</b> <b>challenges</b> facing the OS community.

We propose a pragmatic approach to extensibility, where kernel extensions are used in experimental settings to evaluate and develop OS enhancements for demanding applications. Once developed and well understood, these enhancements are then migrated into the base operating system for production use. This approach obviates the need for guaranteeing safety of kernel extensions, allowing the OS research community to re-focus on the <b>real</b> <b>challenges</b> in OS design and implementation. To provide a concrete example of this approach, we analyze the techniques used in experimental HTTP servers to show how proper application design combined with generic enhancements to operating systems can provide the same benefits without requiring applicati [...] ...|$|R

In February 1965, Camp Holloway's outer perimeter was protected by a South Vietnamese security contingent which included one Ranger battalion, five Regional Force companies and one armored squadron. However, in their reconnaissance of Camp Holloway, the Viet Cong found the security barrier which surrounded the U.S. advisory compound was the <b>real</b> <b>challenge,</b> as it was protected by several layers of concertina wire fences which measured about [...] high.|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of Labour's second defeat at the Scottish Parliament {{election}} of May 2011, which saw the Scottish National Party (SNP) form its first majority government, Gray announced his intention to step down {{as leader of the}} Labour MSPs later that year.

Lamont declared her candidacy for the leadership election in September 2011 and launched her campaign on 7 November at Stirling University.
