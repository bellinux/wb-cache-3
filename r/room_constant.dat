50|$|Wow and flutter are {{particularly}} audible on music with oboe, string, guitar, flute, brass, or piano solo playing. While wow is perceived clearly as pitch variation, flutter {{can alter the}} sound of the music differently, making it sound ‘cracked’ or ‘ugly’. There is an interesting reason for this. A recorded 1 kHz tone {{with a small amount of}} flutter (around 0.1%) can sound fine in a ‘dead’ listening room, but in a reverberant <b>room</b> <b>constant</b> fluctuations will often be clearly heard. These are the result of the current tone ‘beating’ with its echo, which since it originated slightly earlier, has a slightly different pitch. What is heard is quite pronounced amplitude variation, which the ear is very sensitive to. This probably explains why piano notes sound ‘cracked’. Because they start loud and then gradually tail off, piano notes leave an echo that can be as loud as the dying note that it beats with, resulting in a level that varies from complete cancellation to double-amplitude at a rate of a few Hz: instead of a smoothly dying note we hear a heavily modulated one. Oboe notes may be particularly affected because of their harmonic structure. Another way that flutter manifests is as a truncation of reverb tails. This may be due to the persistence of memory with regard to spatial location based on early reflections and comparison of Doppler effects over time. The auditory system may become distracted by pitch shifts in the reverberation of a signal that should be of fixed and solid pitch.|$|E

Reasons for failure to approach mothers were (a) acute and critical illness of mother or child, (b) discharge from hospital immediately after birth, or (c) organizational and health care-related issues such as mothers not available due to repeated absence from their hospital <b>room,</b> <b>constant</b> visitors, or necessary clinical examinations and therapies.|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{environmental}} factors on evaporative demand (ED) were analyzed, and control characteristics of ED were simulated. ED {{was affected by}} the respective environmental factors of irradiance, air temperature, humidity and wind velocity, and the respective effects on ED appeared in different processes. In particular, the effects of irradiance and humidity appeared more remarkable as {{compared with those of}} air temperature and wind velocity: ED increased almost linearly with increase in irradiance and with decrease in humidity, but the effect of air temperature was not so large under moderate conditions, and the effect of wind became smaller at the higher velocities. Thus, ED was more sensitive to irradiance and humidity than to air temperature and wind velocity. In a phytotron glass <b>room</b> (<b>constant</b> air temperature and wind velocity), it can be possible to control ED by manipulating humidity even under remarkable variation in irradiance...|$|E

40|$|Reverberation {{time within}} studio ’ s decor is changed because of {{addition}} of its surface {{to the overall}} surfaces of the stu dio and also the additional absorption of its materials. It seems reverberation time changes due to studio ’ s decor is little because surface of the decor is small {{in comparison with the}} overall surfaces of the studio and surface has an important role in <b>room</b> <b>constant</b> and therefore in reverberation time. But these changes do not only depend on added surfaces and their absorption. Reverberation time is also dependent on shape of the decor and sometimes. It can decrease the effects of added surfaces which are used to increase the reverberation time. In this paper, a standard television studio is de signed and implemented by using ODEON and 12 different decor which their dimensions and materials are similar to the actual ones, are applied inside the studio.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the project is to maintain the temperature of a <b>room</b> <b>constant</b> using on-off controller. In this project, a control logic is developed and implemented using electronics components. The room is made of aluminium sheet. The logic circuit drives the bulb and exhauster fan fitted in the room. The bulb is used to heat the room, and the exhaust fan is used to cool the same. The temperature of the room is measured with TMP 103 sensor. The room temperature from the sensor is compared with a set value given from a potentiometer. Depending on the compared value the logic circuit decides its control action to be taken, and the overall system becomes a feedback control system. If the set point value is above the sensor measured value, the bulb is turned on {{and at the same}} time fan is turned off to increase temperature.

It is expected that the characteristics of room acoustical parameters and sound pressure level (SPL) attenuation of outdoor spaces surrounded by multi-residential buildings depends on many design factors such as the openness, volume, and building layouts, etc. The aim {{of this study is to}} clarify the influential factors determining room acoustical parameters and SPL attenuation in outdoor spaces that are surrounded by buildings with complicated topographical conditions. A series of measurements was carried out for 15 outdoor spaces in 6 apartment complexes with different building layouts. The 15 outdoor spaces were categorized into 4 types of building layouts: linear-shaped, parallel-shaped, U-shaped, and square-shaped. The result showed that reverberation time (RT) at 500 Hz and 1000 Hz is relatively long, over 4 s, with uneven RT distribution showing a non-diffuse field. With increasing source to receiver distance, the RT and early decay time (EDT) increased logarithmically. On the other hand, the Definition (D 50) and rapid speech transmission index (RASTI) decreased with increasing source to receiver distances. The result for the SPL attenuation measured at a 20 m source to receiver distance in 10 outdoor spaces showed a 17. 7 dB difference between the 10 spaces due to the influence of building geometry. An empirical method considering the openness, size-related parameters, and <b>room</b> <b>constant</b> is also suggested to predict the approximate RT and SPL attenuation in the outdoor spaces...|$|E

Hospital design is changing towards a higher prevalence of single rooms (Scottish Government 2008) {{and in order to}} determine the suitability, patients need to be included in the research process. This study wishes to investigate factors influencing the participant’s wellbeing during a single room stay. Potential participants will be invited to take part in the study while they are still in hospital. The participants wishing to participate will be interviewed to gain qualitative data on whether or not the single room has affected their wellbeing. In addition a deeper understanding into factors influencing their wellbeing will be explored and finally their thoughts, opinions and perceptions of single <b>rooms.</b> <b>Constant</b> comparative data analysis will occur until theoretical saturation has been reached. The results from this study hope to provide nurses and other healthcare professionals (HCP) with information into what it feels like from the patient’s point of view.

The sheep were maintained in four different photoperiods: room 1, simulated natural photoperiod; room 2, normal daylength extremes twice in 12 months, changes occurring {{in a regular}} fashion; room 3, alternating long (16 h) and short (8 h) days for 90 days; <b>room</b> 4, <b>constant</b> light. Cyclic ovarian activity, determined by twice-weekly determinations of serum progesterone, commenced in rooms 1, 2 and 3 after a transition from long to short daylength and terminated during long daylength. Thus in rooms 2 and 3 there were two periods of ovarian activity. In <b>room</b> 4 (<b>constant</b> light) ovarian activity began earlier than in room 1 and was of greater duration (240 days v. 190 days). Basal prolactin levels were highest (50 =n- 34 =m/l) during periods of long daylength and lowest (< 10 =ml) in short daylength. Ewes maintained in constant light had an intermediate level (21 =n- 2 =m/l) throughout the study. Melatonin secretion was lowest during daylight (< 78 pmol/l) and highest during darkness. Night-time melatonin levels varied markedly from hour to hour and between individuals in rooms 1, 2 and 3. There was, however, no consistent seasonal change in the absolute levels of melatonin, although the duration of melatonin secretion did closely follow {{the length of the}} dark phase. There were no significant changes in melatonin levels during the oestrous cycle. Ewes kept in constant light had < 78 pmol melatonin/l throughout the period of study. If the pineal gland is involved in transmitting photoperiodic information to the endocrine system, then it is most likely to be by means of an interaction between duration of melatonin secretion and an underlying change in sensitivity of end organs to melatonin...|$|R
