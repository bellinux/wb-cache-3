5|$|By 1139, an {{invasion}} of England by Robert and Matilda appeared imminent. Geoffrey and Matilda had secured much of Normandy and, together with Robert, spent {{the beginning of the}} year mobilising forces for a cross-Channel expedition. Matilda also appealed to the papacy at the start of the year; her representative, Bishop Ulger, put forward her legal claim to the English throne on the grounds of her hereditary right and the oaths sworn by the barons. Arnulf of Lisieux led Stephen's case, arguing that because Matilda's mother had <b>really</b> <b>been</b> a nun, her claim to the throne was illegitimate. The Pope declined to reverse his earlier support for Stephen, but from Matilda's perspective the case usefully established that Stephen's claim was disputed.|$|E
5|$|Sometime later, {{the player}} wakes up to Chirithy at a {{simulation}} of Enchanted Dominion. Chirithy {{claims that the}} events of the Keyblade War have <b>really</b> <b>been</b> a dream the player has had ever since turning down Ava's offer to join the Dandelions (although in Unchained χ, it is revealed that the player is actually sent to the Unchained Realm by Ephemer and Skuld) and the two decide to rest after confronting a wall of thorns. On {{the other side of the}} thorns, Maleficent (who is heavily implied to have found the Book of Prophecies) congratulates herself with what she has accomplished whilst wondering where Pete is. Confident that Sora and company cannot meddle in this world, she contemplates on conquering this iteration of her home world that she has entered in.|$|E
5|$|The major {{characteristic}} of Prester John tales {{from this period}} is the king's portrayal not as an invincible hero, but merely one of many adversaries defeated by the Mongols. But as the Mongol Empire collapsed, Europeans began to shift away from the idea that Prester John had ever <b>really</b> <b>been</b> a Central Asian king. At any rate they had little hope of finding him there, as travel in the region became dangerous without the security the Empire had provided. In works such as The Travels of Sir John Mandeville and Historia Trium Regum by John of Hildesheim, Prester John's domain tends to regain its fantastic aspects and finds itself located not on the steppes of Central Asia, but back in India proper, or some other exotic locale. Wolfram von Eschenbach tied the history of Prester John to the Holy Grail legend in his poem Parzival, in which the Prester {{is the son of}} the Grail maiden and the Saracen knight Feirefiz.|$|E

40|$|This paper takes {{a closer}} look at really in order to account for its various interpretations. Stenstrm's (1986) work on really forms the starting-point for the investigation. The {{following}} examples are from Stenstrm (1986 : 151), where she claims that the different readings of <b>really</b> <b>are</b> due to position and syntactic function: (1) this question <b>is</b> <b>really</b> surprising (2) this <b>is</b> a <b>really</b> surprising question (3) this <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a surprising question (4) this <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a surprising question (5) <b>really</b> this <b>is</b> a surprising question Stenstrm states that when <b>really</b> <b>is</b> placed next to the adjective, as in (1) and (2), it is a degree modifier which serves as an intensifier of surprising. But, the further <b>really</b> <b>is</b> moved to the left, the less is the emphasis on surprising and the more it is on the whole a surprising question. When <b>really</b> <b>is</b> placed in initial position, as in (5), it no longer intensifies a single clause element but is a comment on the whole proposition. Stenstrm remains vague about the intermediate positions and about the more exact interaction between syntactic position and interpretation. She concludes that what finally decides the function of <b>really</b> <b>is</b> the combined effect of position, prosody and the wider context. In contrast to Stenstrm, I propose that the motivating factors for the readings are semantic/pragmatic in nature rather than syntactic/positiona...|$|R

25|$|After {{beginning}} 1996 {{with two}} more quick knockouts over Guy Stanford and Anthony Brooks, he successfully defended his British title with an easier-than-expected fifth round stoppage of the tough undefeated puncher Mark Delaney (21–0). Despite Delaney being a good fighter in his own right, Calzaghe's critics {{said that he had}} still not <b>really</b> <b>been</b> tested.

Calzaghe rounded off the year with victories over two experienced opponents in Warren Stowe and Pat Lawlor.|$|E
25|$|Even though Isesi-ankh {{bore the}} title of King's son, the Egyptologists Michel Baud and Bettina Schmitz have shown that this {{filiation}} was probably fictitious, being used only as an honorary title. In particular, inscriptions found on the construction blocks of his mastaba give one of his titles as Seal bearer of the king Isesi ankh, while Baud argues that had he <b>really</b> <b>been</b> {{the son of a}} king, this title would have been Seal bearer of the king, king's son, Isesi ankh. Consequently, Isesi-ankh's father was likely not Djedkare Isesi.|$|E

Materialism <b>is</b> <b>really</b> our established Church; for the Government will really help it to persecute its heretics. Vaccination, in its hundred years of experiment, has been disputed {{almost as much as}} baptism in its approximate two thousand.

25|$|In 2014 it was {{discovered}} that samples of suspected Lassa fever showed evidence of the Zaire strain of Ebola virus in Sierra Leone as early as 2006.

It is suspected that fruit bats are natural carriers of disease, native to this region of Africa including Sierra Leone and also a popular food source for both humans and wildlife.

25|$|Haig gave Foch {{the same}} advice at the Senlis Conference (25 October) – he was privately {{suspicious}} of French plans {{to occupy the}} Rhineland, writing to his wife (1 November) that {{the peace of the}} world for the next fifty years depended on not driving Germany to seek future revenge by humiliating her. He would later (e.g. in June 1919) defend the decision to save lives and money by offering Germany an armistice once she was clearly beaten, although with hindsight this allowed the myth to grow up that Germany had not <b>really</b> <b>been</b> defeated. The Allies agreed to offer peace {{on the basis of the}} Fourteen Points with a British opt-out for Point 2 (Freedom of the Seas).|$|E
25|$|Although {{there had}} never <b>really</b> <b>been</b> peace, the War of the Ring started in Rohan when Saruman's troops crossed the Fords of Isen. Théodred, {{the son of the}} King Théoden, had mustered his forces on the fords to launch a {{surprise}} attack against the enemy. On 23 February TA 3019 he attacked the vanguard of the orcs marching out of Isengard. Reinforcements were quickly sent from Isengard however, and Théodred ordered a retreat. His forces retreated to an island in the fords, but they were soon surrounded and he was killed. Grimbold managed to hold the island, but would not have succeeded if Elfhelm had not come with reinforcements from Helm's Deep. Thus the first battle of the Fords of Isen ended in defeat for the Rohirrim.|$|E

25|$|In 2004 an {{election}} promise by Viktor Yanukovych (leader of the Party of Regions) to adopt Russian {{as the second}} official language might also have increased the turnout of his base, but it was rebutted during the campaign by his opponent (Viktor Yushchenko), who pointed out that Yanukovych could have already taken steps towards this change {{while he was a}} Prime Minister of Ukraine if this had <b>really</b> <b>been</b> his priority. During his campaign Yushchenko emphasized that his being painted as a proponent of the closure of Russian schools frequently made by his opponents is entirely baseless and stated his view that the issue of school language, as well as the churches, should be left to local communities. Nevertheless, during Yuchshenko's presidency the transfer of educational institutions from Russian to Ukrainian continued.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't <b>really</b> <b>been</b> much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E
25|$|The French chose Picot as French High Commissioner for the {{soon to be}} {{occupied}} {{territory of}} Syria and Palestine. The British appointed Sykes as Chief Political Officer to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. On 3 April 1917, Sykes met with Lloyd George, Curzon and Hankey to receive his instructions in this regard, namely to keep the French onside while pressing for a British Palestine. First Sykes in early May and then Picot and Sykes together visited the Hejaz later in May to discuss the agreement with Faisal and Hussein. Hussein was persuaded {{to agree to a}} formula to the effect that the French would pursue the same policy in Syria as the British in Baghdad; since Hussein believed that Baghdad would be part of the Arab State, that had eventually satisfied him. Later reports from participants expressed doubts about the precise nature of the discussions {{and the degree to which}} Hussein had <b>really</b> <b>been</b> informed as to the terms of Sykes–Picot.|$|E
