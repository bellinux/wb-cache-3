Thirdly, a numerical simulation model is developed to evaluate the optical performance of fiber and planar waveguide amplifiers based on these materials. ^ Due to the qualitatively different features of our <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> doped polymer materials from their glass counterparts, ran earth ions can be doped into polymer hosts in extremely high concentrations, making short length optical amplification devices feasible in <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> doped polymer systems. We fabricate our <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> doped polymers and measure their optical properties, such as the absorption spectra, the emission spectra and the metastable state lifetimes. Further, we calculate the optical transition cross-sections from the measured absorption and emission spectra as well as the fluorescence decay rate. The viability of light amplification is investigated in <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> doped polymer optical devices based on planar waveguide as well as cylindrical waveguide configurations. The dependence of amplification performance on various parameters of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> doped amplifiers are studied by numerical calculations.

5|$|Acid {{digestion}} is a two-stage process, {{involving the}} use of up to 93% sulfuric acid at 210–230°C. First, 60% sulfuric acid is added, thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed. Then, fuming sulfuric acid is added and the mixture is kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution. The concentration of the sulfuric acid is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity, which both increase with concentration, albeit with viscosity retarding the reaction. Increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction, but temperatures of 300°C and above must be avoided, because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form. Since dissolution is very exothermic, the monazite sand cannot {{be added to the}} acid too quickly. Conversely, at temperatures below 200°C the reaction does not go fast enough for the process to be practical. To ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive monazite surface, the mass of acid used must be twice that of the sand, instead of the 60% that would be expected from stoichiometry. The mixture is then cooled to 70°C and diluted with ten times its volume of cold water, so that any remaining monazite sinks to the bottom while the <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> and thorium remain in solution.

5|$|Alkaline {{digestion}} {{is carried}} out in 30–45% sodium hydroxide solution at about 140°C for about three hours. Too high a temperature leads {{to the formation of}} poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the filtrate, and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction. These reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite sand with a particle size under 45μm. Following filtration, the filter cake includes thorium and the <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> as their hydroxides, uranium as sodium diuranate, and phosphate as trisodium phosphate. This crystallises trisodium phosphate decahydrate when cooled below 60°C; uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of silicon dioxide in the reaction mixture, necessitating recrystallisation before commercial use. The hydroxides are then dissolved at 80°C in 37% hydrochloric acid. Filtration of the remaining precipitates followed by addition of 47% sodium hydroxide results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about pH 5.8. Complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided, as then air may oxidise cerium from the +3 to the +4 oxidation state, and the cerium(IV) formed can then liberate free chlorine from the hydrochloric acid. The <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> again precipitate out at higher pH. The precipitates are then neutralised by the original sodium hydroxide solution, although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare-earth phosphates. Solvent extraction may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium, by dissolving the resultant filter cake in nitric acid. The presence of titanium hydroxide is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully.|$|E

The persistence of <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> DTPA complexes in estuarine waters was measured in simulated laboratory studies and in two field studies conducted in the South Shore Marina in Newport, Oregon.
