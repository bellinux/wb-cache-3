Metallic bipolar {{plates with}} unique wave-like {{microstructure}} {{on the bottom}} of microflow channel have shown promising prospects for the application in proton exchange membrane microfuel cell. A novel method—milling with special thin <b>slotting</b> <b>cutters</b> is developed for fabrication of wave-like microstructure {{on the bottom of}} microflow channels. The special thin <b>slotting</b> <b>cutter</b> is manufactured by removing one or several teeth every one tooth of the traditional <b>slotting</b> <b>cutter</b> regularly. Forming mechanism of wave-like microstructure is presented and experimental tests have been conducted for validation of the feasibility of the novel method. Results show that the wave-like microstructure can be successfully fabricated on the bottom of microflow channel. The bottom of bipolar plates with wave-like microstructure is not a flat plane, but a wavy groove. The wavelength and amplitude of wave-like microstructure increase with the increase of feed speed and the number of removed teeth...|$|R

30|$|The sound {{pressure}} level of differently designed circular saw blades were investigated during idling. Nine blade samples were used: three differently designed blade bodies (without <b>slots,</b> with four <b>radial</b> <b>slots,</b> and with four slots with copper cork), each with three diameters (260, 280, and 300 mm). The {{sound pressure}} level was measured at different rotational frequencies ranging from 25 to 65 rps in increments of 1 rps. Rubber damping rings 80 mm in diameter and 0.3 mm thick were placed between the saw blade and the collars, and the emitted noise was measured. Because of the whistling sound the blades without slots emitted high {{sound pressure level}}s. There were no significant changes when rubber damping rings were used. The use of rubber damping rings on the samples with <b>radial</b> <b>slots</b> eliminates the whistling noise. The saws with copper corks did not emit a whistling noise at all, and their aerodynamic noise was 2 – 3 dB (A) lower than the aerodynamic noise of the saws with <b>radial</b> <b>slots.</b> The relation between sound pressure emitted by the damped idling saw and peripheral velocity can be described by the power function with the exponent value between 4.8 and 5.2.|$|R

5000|$|Dome-based {{diaphragms}} {{are similar}} to the 1920s Thuras/Wente patents, and are still in common use today. Phase plugs that interface with dome-type diaphragms include a wide variety: designs with <b>radial</b> <b>slots,</b> designs with concentric annular ring slots, and hybrid designs with a combination of annular and <b>radial</b> <b>slots.</b> Altec engineer Clifford A. Henricksen reported on the differences between radial and [...] "circumferential" [...] types of phase plugs at Audio Engineering Society conventions in 1976 and 1978. The radial design is easier to produce, but it does not differentiate between sound waves from the perimeter of the diaphragm and sound waves from the center. At high frequencies, the diaphragm does not act as a perfect piston; instead, it displays rippling, modal properties related to its stiffness and density. Because of the speed of wave propagation through the diaphragm material, the center of the diaphragm moves slightly later than the perimeter. <b>Radial</b> <b>slots</b> in the phase plug do not correct for this small time difference, which affects the highest frequencies. Concentric circular slots may be able to correct for the diaphragm's rippling behavior but the positioning of the slots is critical. Circular slots may allow resonances to build up between the diaphragm and the phase plug—resonances which cause wave cancellations and a corresponding reduction in frequency response at the resonance frequency.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a theoretical analysis model and a design procedure to synthesize aperture coupled microstrip patch arrays using a radial line feed. As a first topic, a lossy radial transmission line model is developed to predict slot coupling. With the reciprocity technique and a moment method analysis, key design parameters for realizing a <b>radial</b> line <b>slot</b> array are modeled to formulate the slot coupling problem. By applying the sequential array technique for circular polarization to <b>radial</b> line <b>slot</b> array design, good performance is found for both axial ratio and return loss bandwidth. The aperture efficiency degradation of a sequential array having elliptically polarized elements is investigated by evaluating the gain versus element spacing and polarization ellipticity. A sample design for a 18 cm aperture diameter <b>radial</b> line <b>slot</b> array with 42 % aperture efficiency validates these theoretical approaches. Next, an aperture coupled microstrip patch array with a radial line feed is analyzed by modifying the analysis model of the <b>radial</b> line <b>slot</b> array. By using linearly polarized aperture coupled patches as radiating elements, sampled designs of aperture coupled microstrip patch arrays using radial line feeds are used to demonstrate the feasibility of this new structure. ...|$|R
