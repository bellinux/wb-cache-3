6000|$|But, {{though the}} church, {{in the border}} counties, {{attracted}} little veneration, no part of Scotland teemed with superstitious fears and observances more than they did. [...] "The Dalesmen[48]," [...] says Lesley, [...] "never count their beads with such earnestness as when they set out upon a predatory expedition." [...] Penances, the composition betwixt guilt and conscience, were also frequent upon the borders. Of this we have a record in many bequests to the church, and in some more lasting monuments; such as the Tower of Repentance in Dumfries-shire, and, according to vulgar tradition, the church of Linton[49], in Roxburghshire. In the appendix to this introduction. No. IV., the reader will find a curious league, or treaty of peace, betwixt two hostile clans, by which the heads of each became bound to make the four pilgrimages of Scotland, {{for the benefit of}} the souls of those of the opposite clan, who had fallen in the feud. These were superstitions, flowing immediately from the nature of the Catholic religion: but there was, upon the border, no lack of others of a more general nature. Such was the universal belief in spells, of which some traces may yet remain in the wild parts of the country. These were common in the time of the learned Bishop Nicolson, who derives them from the time of the Pagan Danes. [...] "This conceit was the more heightened, by reflecting upon the natural superstition of our borderers at this day, who were much better acquainted with, and do more firmly believe, their old legendary stories, of fairies and witches, than the articles of their creed. And to convince me, yet farther, that they are not utter strangers to the black art of their forefathers, I met with a gentleman in the neighbourhood, who shewed me a book of spells, and magical receipts, taken, two or three days before, in the pocket of one of our moss-troopers; wherein, among many other conjuring feats, was prescribed, a certain remedy for an ague, by applying a few barbarous characters to the body of the party distempered. These, methought, were very near a-kin to Wormius's Ram <b>Runer,</b> which, he says, differed wholly in figure and shape from the common runae. For, though he tells us, that these Ram <b>Runer</b> were so called, Eo quod molestias, dolores, morbosque hisce infligere inimicis soliti sunt magi; yet his great friend, Arng. Jonas, more to our purpose, says, that--His etiam usi sunt ad benefaciendum, juvandum, medicandum tam animi quam corporis morbis; atque ad ipsos cacodaemones pellendos et fugandos. I shall not trouble you with a draught of this spell, because I have not yet had an opportunity of learning whether it may not be an ordinary one, and to be met with, among others of the same nature, in Paracelsus, or Cornelius Agrippa."--Letter from Bishop Nicolson to Mr. Walker; vide Camden's Britannia, Cumberland. Even in the editor's younger days, he can remember the currency of certain spells, for curing sprains, burns, or dislocations, to which popular credulity ascribed unfailing efficacy[50]. Charms, however, against spiritual enemies, were yet more common than those intended to cure corporeal complaints. This is not surprising, as a fantastic remedy well suited an imaginary disease.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is the study of}} the journalism of <b>Runer</b> Jonsson (born 1916), as sole editor of Nybro Tidning, published by the printing house Johansson & Svenson AB. Although coming directly from industrial work, not quite 20 of age and not at all experienced in newspaper publishing Jonsson started his new career after for two years having showed his ability as a writer of local sport, short stories and poems in Kalmar-Kalmar Läns Tidning as well in Nybro Tidning. Jonsson got into his work very fast. The themes I focus on are how he, comparatively very early for Swedish press, energically attached great importance to the nar¬row, local matters and the defence of the interests of his town. Important tasks in his jour¬nalism became the standard of general education and raising his town in cultural senses and common good behavior. In this connection he also on a higher level discussed culture quality and criticized evening papers, gossip magazines and low class TV. Jonsson paid positive attention on local news and kindly formulated personal short articles. As a very important subject he devoted himself to sport, both personally engaged in the clubs of his town and in large texts in the paper. He showed a notable freedom of respect to genre and not seldom mixed personal values even in news articles. In his chronicles he also took part in many types of actual debates and often sent his messages in humorous, satiric short prose and verse. As responsible for a very small local paper in of the smallest of towns in Sweden Jonsson immediately and very young payed a remarkable attention to the events on the international stage. He dealt with the Spanish Civil War (against Franco), the Finnish Winter War (against the Russians) and Germany and its leaders and role in the second World War. Jonsson appeared as a true democrate and boldly criticized nazism as well as commu¬¬nism as it functioned in practice. In the 50 ´s, 60 ´s and 70 ´s he through a progressiv, left-wing perspective dealt with nuclear weapons, capital punishment, colonialism and all similar sorts of repression, luxary consumption, space research and the third world problem and porno¬graphy. On the other side Jonsson with force supported the trading and other enterprises of his town with editorial commercials. Thanks to this he at the same time acquired paying adver tisers succesfully. Jonsson was an urgent, plain writing journalist and therefore his paper contained few pictu¬res during its most splendid 30 first years. During this period he also raised the edition from 3000 to 3800 copies. Johansson & Svenson AB was in 1966 sold to the bigger company Ljungdahls AB which for <b>Runer</b> Jonsson resulted in several changes for the worse, like less independence and a con¬siderable extra work with canvassing advertisments. A new sale of the paper part separa¬tely to Kalmar Läns Tidning in 1976 led to even more change for the worse. During the last five years of Jonsson´s employment. Nybro Tidning now became an edition of the Kalmar paper. Beside all journalism in Nybro Tidning and a lot of additional writing in other papers Jonsson was successful in bookwriting ? from lyrics, aphorismes, short satirics to books for younger people. During his editionship of Nybro Tidning he produced 30 books. And until today he has published more than 50. The most famous ones are about the peaceful viking Vickie Viking, which of translations are made into 20 languages. And still in 2006 <b>Runer</b> Jonsson every 14 th day publishes a chronicle in Nybro Tidning...|$|E
40|$|Treball final de Grau en Estudis Anglesos. Codi: EA 0938. Curs acadèmic 2015 - 2016 This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to analyse how the Viking Age has been depicted in audiovisual materials, namely in a present-day television series called ‘Vikings’. With that purpose in mind, some historical evidences on these Nordic people who settled Scandinavia during the eighth to eleventh centuries will be firstly introduced. A focus will be placed on their lifestyle and traditions together with a brief chronological timeline on their sea adventures and invasions of lands that satisfied the Vikings’ need for fight and wealth. The Vikings have reached us by means of Scandinavian sagas, archaeological findings and historical data which have certainly exerted a powerful influence in our times. These inhabitants of northern lands have been given prominence in many written compositions (e. g. ‘Vicke Viking’ by <b>Runer</b> Jonsson), musicals (e. g. ‘Yo, Vikings!’), theatrical pieces (e. g. ‘Meet the Vikings’ by Sue Rusell) and audiovisual productions like the one to be analysed in this paper. Thus, it will be tried {{to give an account}} of their impact throughout this paper. Finally, general information about the ‘Vikings’ series will be provided and an episode will be carefully examined {{to be able to see}} up to what extend it meets real historical data. Therefore, our main aim is to learn if historical events, places and characters represented in the television series can be trusted...|$|E
40|$|Rainfall-triggered {{landslides}} {{taking place}} in the Spanish Eastern Pyrenees have usually been analysed on a regional scale. Most research focussed either on terrain susceptibility or on the characteristics of the critical rainfall, neglecting a detailed analysis of individual events. In contrast to other mountainous regions, research on debris flow has only been performed marginally and associated hazard has mostly been neglected. In this study, five debris flows, which occurred in 2008, are selected; and site specific descriptions and analysis regarding geology, morphology, rainfall data and runout were performed. The results are compared with worldwide data and some conclusions on hazard assessment are presented. The five events can be divided into two in-channel debris flows and three landslide-triggered debris flows. The in-channel generated debris flows exceeded 10 000 m 3 , which are unusually large mass movements compared to historic events which occurred in the Eastern Pyrenees. In contrast, the other events mobilised total volumes less than 2000 m 3 . The geomorphologic analysis showed that the studied events emphasize similar patterns when compared to published data focussing on slope angle in the initiation zone or catchment area. Rainfall data revealed that all debris flows were triggered by high intensity-short duration rainstorms during the summer season. Unfortunately, existing rainfall thresholds in the Eastern Pyrenees consider long-lasting rainfall, usually occurring in autumn/winter. Therefore, new thresholds should be established taking into account the rainfall peak intensity in mm/h, which seems to be a much more relevant factor for summer than the event's total precipitation. The runout analysis of the 2008 debris flows confirms the trend that larger volumes generally induce higher mobility. The numerical simulation of the Riu <b>Runer</b> event shows that its dynamic behaviour is well represented by Voellmy fluid rheology. A maximum front velocity of 7 m/s was back-analysed for the transit section and even on the fan velocities larger than 2 m/s were obtained. This preliminary analysis of the major Eastern Pyrenean debris flows represents the first background for future studies. Additional research on other events is necessary to support the results presented herein, and to properly assess and reduce hazard related to debris flows...|$|E
