In Japan, however, the elderly {{have no choice but}} to be relocated whereas aging-in-place has been achieved in Australia. What does contribute to this difference? To learn how nursing care continues from health care institutions to community to promote home care in Australia as well as to assess the current situation of residential care,we toured and attended lectures at a visiting care service provided by an acute-phase hospital in Melbourne, a community care service agency,and a <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institution</b> for the elderly. As a result, it was revealed that there was a disparity in the amount of the public assistance allocated to the health care and welfare systems and home care between Japan and Australia,and this fact was indicated to have caused the difference of care in the elderly between two countries. メルボルンのアルフレッド病院におけるHospital in the Homeについての講義ならびに、Royal District Nursing Serviceおよびモナッシュ市の高齢者ケア施設であるMonash Garedenの 2 施設の見学をとおして得られた情報に先行研究を加味して報告する...|$|E
40|$|This master’s thesis {{deals with}} the role of the family in shaping ideas on values, and the attitudes of young people towards the family. The family is {{perceived}} as the basic structure within which a person’s psychic structure emerges and develops through relationships, and thus the person’s system of values is shaped. From this perspective values are not inborn, but are acquired. As parents, we thus {{have to know how to}} live according to our values, and how to transfer them to our children through their upbringing. Unfortunately, some parents fail in this task. Moreover, a growing number of families are facing difficulties in various areas of life, which can have a strong impact on the development of a child/young person, and consequently on the development of emotional and behavioural problems/disorders that are one of the main reasons why children/young people may be sent to a <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institution.</b> The theoretical part of this thesis deals with three basic areas: values, family as the first provider of values, and the emotional and behavioural problems/disorders that can arise as a consequence of unfavourable family conditions. The empirical part of this work, with survey questionnaires for children/young people in the last triad of elementary school who live with their immediate families (N= 106), and those who live in a <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institution</b> (N= 71), aims to verify whether there are differences between both groups in terms of their ideas and perceptions of values and family, and whether there are differences in their views of how parents/carers/foster carers respond to their basic needs. I was also interested in how the relationships with parents/carers/foster carers are seen by children/young people who live in residential care institutions compared to those who live with their immediate families, and how children/young people feel in residential care institutions. The research results demonstrate that children/young people who live with their immediate families gave higher ratings to the values of love and positive approach, health, belief in God and respect of laws, while those who live in residential care institutions gave higher ratings to values such as free time, success in career, good food and drink and hygiene and cleanliness. In their estimations of their parents/carers responses to their basic needs, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. Moreover, both groups had similar responses with regard to how they experience their families and the activities that take place within them. The children/young people who live with their immediate families were more likely to feel that their parents accept them such as they are, that they are satisfied with the relationship they have with their parents, and that their parents would protect them in case of danger, however, they also feel, that parents expect too much from them. In contrast, the children/young people who live in residential care institutions felt that they do not get on well with their parents, that their parents fail to understand them, and that they would prefer to live in a different family, however, they also stated that they have a good relationship with their parents/carers. Although the children/young people living in residential care institutions had unpleasant experiences in their families, and suffered because of neglect and frequent disappointments, the idea of the family remained sacred and very important to them –on average they felt very good at home (́x ̅ = 4. 6), and after leaving their residential care institutions most (73...|$|E
40|$|In my diploma thesis special {{attention}} {{is given to}} care workers that work {{with a group of}} youth in extrafamilial residential institutions. They are defined as a team or work group, depending on the work structure. I am aware of the difficulty of educational team work and that is why I want to define and research their experiencing team or group work. At the beginning of the theoretical part I define educational work in educational institutions and youth homes, then continue with the definition of team work, communication between care workers and presence of conflicts in teams as well as their solving. And finish with the importance of professional and personal growth of care workers that is realised through supervision. In the empirical part I qualitatively assess their opinions, standpoints and evaluation obtained through oriented group conversations. The results have shown that care workers usually evaluate their work and cooperation as good. They say that they strive for joint goals, positive atmosphere in team and educational group and to solve potential disagreements and conflicts, all with the help of open communication. Different beliefs and lack of time for team work are the biggest obstacles at their work, because each care worker works for himself and they all come together at weekly sessions and when they hand over their work. Differences between team work in educational institutions and youth homes are present and they are usually the consequence of the organisation of educational institution. Youth home is a type of institution that is more open so the children and care workers can work together with external institutions more often and can integrate in the environment (children also visit external schools). The majority of care workers participate in supervision (which is in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institution</b> organised within the institution and in youth homes as joint supervisions) through which they solve professional questions...|$|E
40|$|In {{connection}} with child raising, {{we are more}} and more often hearing words such as feeble parental education, children's indulgence, overprotection, loss of authority, etc. How much are these phenomena present in the family is quite dependent on the parenting style used by parents. Theoretical part of the master's thesis begins with the definition of concepts that help to understand the function of the family and its influence on the child's development. The work focuses primarily on the dysfunctional families, as well as the risk factors that influence the occurrence of problematic behaviour of children. Hereinafter the thesis defines parenting styles and their connection to the development of emotional behavioural disorders and difficulties with children. At the end of the theoretical part there are highlighted characteristics of <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions,</b> children included in their programs, the work of care workers and their influence on education. In the empirical part, the master's thesis identifies the characteristics of the families of children in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions,</b> which parenting styles did the children receive in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> in their primary family, as recognized by care workers, and how that influences the educational approaches of care workers. The study uses a descriptive method and a quantitative research approach. A questionnaire is used as a technique of data collection and the research includes care workers employed in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> with a length of service of more than ten years. The findings show that children in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> mostly come from families with separated parents who are most often confronted with feeble parental education, unemployment and financial problems. Care workers in these families most often perceive a permissive parenting style, but it is closely followed by other parenting styles. Nevertheless, almost all care workers who participated in the research find that parenting styles have changed over the last ten years and more, and so today permissive and overly indulgent parenting is noticeable in more and more families. In accordance with these findings almost all care workers state that during this period educational approaches in the work with children and their families have changed considerably. Findings from the research could be very important for dealing with problems of children involved in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions,</b> and for further planning of programs and effective work of care workers. ...|$|R

At the beginning, I start with the critical analysis of before-mentioned assumptions. Critical analysis are based on the theory of social construction of gender. I continue with the analysis of knowledge production in the context of disciplines, relevant to social pedagogy, that is psychoanalysis, social psychology (and its concept of gender roles) and Parsons’ theory of functionalist division of roles. In the second part I analyze the potential coherence between the discourses of family-like education model on one hand and the needed competences of professional workers, active in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> on the second. I also analyze the potential legitimacy of family-like education model in terms of potential gender-specific needs of children and youth in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions.</b> At the end I analyze the problematic nature of before-mentioned discourses for social pedagogy, which is primarily working with vulnerable individuals and marginalized social groups.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{explores the}} norms which evolve in {{the groups of}} the youth with emotional, behavioural and social disorders, i. e. {{those who live in}} <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions.</b> The second part introduces the theoretical frame of norms. Although they have a very important part within the field of social psychology, they have been unjustly overlooked for quite some time. I continue by defining the population and by problematizing the current social standpoint, which has an important influence on the ratio and the status of the youth in the <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions.</b> These adolescents are labelled as “different” by comparison with their peers and this is the main reason why I conducted the research presented in the third part. Using the focus group method in one of the Slovenian <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions,</b> I explore what are the norms which cause the adolescents to form certain groups, what are their characteristics and how they differentiate according to sex. The findings show an inferior internalization and fluidity of norms related to the appearance of the groups, whereas the norms related to the activities and the orientation of the groups are firmly internalized. An interesting fact is that the norms for which the group strives are socially desired, worrying are only their maintenance and sanctions, which can be very aggressive {{when it comes to a}} violation. Besides, the findings offer us some instructions for our further pedagogical work...|$|R
40|$|Lithuanian {{society is}} aging, {{and need for}} social {{services}} for elderly people is constantly increasing as it allows enjoying better quality of life. Elderly people (+ 65) who become socially dependent have possibility {{to move to the}} <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institution.</b> The scenario of moving into long-term care institution has big and often negative impact on life quality of elderly person. Empirical research data was collected 2011 – 2013. The age of participants was 60 – 92 years at the moment of interview. The data was collected during multiple visits to residential long-term care institutions in different regions of Lithuania (both in rural and urban areas). The conducted interviews were semi-structured; participants’ life story narrative was major focus. Constructivist grounded theory methodology (Charmaz, 2006) was the tool to analyse subjective quality of life, values and attitudes of elderly socially dependent residents. In the process of constructing grounded theory seven factors of life quality were identified. The most important factor is independence (self-reliance) understood as capability and wish of the elderly person to make decisions that have direct impact on her/ his everyday life (day regime, activities, and aspects of private finances management). “Independence” as one of the main analytical categories is analysed through the example of life story of  Ruta using particular elements of biographical research on micro level. Capability to stay independent while participating in care process, maintain vital social relations, and consciously reflect on changes in last stage of human life have ultimate meaning for elderly people.

40|$|Manoeuvring {{between social}} work and peer groups The general goal of Danish <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> with a {{therapeutic}} objective is to change children’s behaviour and redirect their identity formation. This goal is pursued through an individualized focus on development. Dynamics of the resident group is rarely targeted directly in the pedagogical work. This article challenges the implicit understanding that social work is {{the primary source of}} identity transformation and that peer group interaction is mainly an obstacle to overcome. On the contrary, this article argues that learning about the social dynamics of the children’s group is a precondition for understanding how social work influences individual children. Many welfare institutions for children in the western world have a civilizing project in educating children and shaping their identities. This focus is parti-cularly explicit in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> with therapeutic purposes for children who have social, emotional and psychological problems. The main goal of these institutions is to educate, initiate change in behaviour and self-perception and thereby influence identity processes. The process is undertaken through social pedagogy, that is, various social pedagogical activities and approaches initiated by professionals. However, when children are placed in <b>residential</b> <b>care,</b> they are not only exposed to the professional staff’s peda-gogical initiatives, they are also placed in a particular social setting with a group of other children and adults with whom they interact and connect on an everyday basis (Emond, 2000, 2004; Polsky, 1962; Stokholm, 2009). Everyday social relations and interaction with significant others – especially peers – are important sources of self-perception and self-management and hence identity formation (Adler and Adler, 2001; Corsaro, 2005; Frønes, 1995). Taking an anthropological perspective, the aim {{of this article is to}} analyse and discuss the important question that arises: in an institutional setting explicitly focused on influencing identity formation and on teaching childre...|$|R

40|$|Current {{public opinion}} about the <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> system in {{contemporary}} Russia is extremely negative. A majority of Russians, both citizens and professionals, consider that family placement is the best arrangement for orphaned children. The year 2007 was announced as the Year of the Child in Russia. The majority of officials interpreted it as the year of de-institutionalization of the <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> system for children in Russia. De-institutionalization is mostly identified as reform focused on family placement instead of placement in institutions.

But the likelihood of family placement is small, with the exception of the adoption of infants without serious pathologies, and the attempts of precipitant de-institutionalization (when children’s homes are closed and children are distributed among families) have failed (children were returned into children homes).

Methods 20 <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> including 689 children and adolescents (age 4 – 18 years; mean 14. 4; SD = 2. 9) participated. A two-step design was performed. First, the children and adolescents and their residential caregivers answered a standard symptom checklist (CBCL/YSR). For those participants scoring more than one standard deviation above the mean of their German population reference group, a standardized clinical examination was performed to specify an ICD- 10 diagnosis.

We analyze mainstream approaches to study these institu-tions in Spain and {{in other parts of}} Europe. From this review, we argue in favor of an approach focused on the role of social practices as constitutive elements of institutional life and products. Our proposal focuses on one type of <b>institution,</b> <b>residential</b> child <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> (RCCIs), to highlight how traditional limits between formally designed activities and informal prac-tices may be problematized.

40|$|Purpose of reviewTo {{provide an}} {{overview}} of the burden of norovirus disease in healthcare settings and the factors responsible for outbreaks in these institutions; to assess progress on interventions aimed at reducing the burden of norovirus disease. Recent findingsNorovirus outbreaks in healthcare settings are driven by confluence of viral diversity, the built environment, and host factors. Some of these characteristics may be modifiable and the target of successful interventions. SummaryMost norovirus outbreaks in hospital and <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> are associated with a particular genotype, known as GII. 4. The persistence of norovirus is associated with strain diversity, which is driven by immune evasion and viral adaptation to interaction with a variety of human histo-blood group antigens. The healthcare environment presents serious challenges for control, both because of the physical structure of the built space and the high levels of contact among patient populations who may have compromised hygiene. Increased vulnerability among the populations in healthcare institutions is likely to be multifactorial and may include the following: nutritional status, immunodeficiency or senescence, chronic inflammation, and microbiome alterations. Current control measures are based on general infection control principles, and treatment is mainly supportive and nonspecific.

Methods: A retrospective registry based study between 2010 and 2014 on patients aged 55 years and over who sustained a moderate to critical injury from a fall, examining mortality and length of stay using regression analyses.

Associations with specific psychopathology need to be studied in order to sensitize caregivers to the specific needs of this population. The present study aimed to assess the relationship between interpersonal traumatic experiences and specific psychopathological symptoms in a high-risk population of girls and boys living in youth welfare <b>institutions</b> in <b>residential</b> <b>care.</b> 370 adolescents living in 64 different Swiss institutions and their professional caregivers filled out questionnaires on traumatic experiences and psychopathology and took part in structured clinical interviews. They were grouped in 3 different subgroups: no interpersonal trauma, single interpersonal trauma and multiple interpersonal trauma, i. e. interpersonal trauma in two or more domains. Furthermore, associations between the identity of the perpetrator (if the perpetrator was known vs. unknown to the victim) and psychopathology were examined. One third of participants reported multiple interpersonal trauma with female adolescents being more often affected. Multiple interpersonal trauma was associated with more internalizing and externalizing symptoms, but this association was only found with self-reported psychopathology. Male adolescents with multiple interpersonal trauma seemed to be more vulnerable to substance use and affective disorders, while female adolescents with multiple interpersonal trauma tended to have disorders of attention, activity and conduct disorders. Interpersonal trauma (compared to no interpersonal trauma) was not associated with higher rates of PTSD. Furthermore, associations between interpersonal trauma and psychopathology were stronger when the perpetrator was known to the victim. Our results suggest that interpersonal trauma, especially multiple interpersonal trauma, seem to be associated with mental health problems beyond the symptoms of PTSD in this high-risk population.

40|$|Aim. The particularity of the {{adolescent}} with medium- severe psychopathology and the extreme lack of placements different from hospitals (e. g. residential and semi-residential) often hamper the early intervention of the therapeutic treatment. From our experience from the daily Semi-residential Service for Adolescents at the Childhood and Adolescence Neuropsychiatry Unit of the Public Health Services (Azienda ULSS 16) in Padua, Italy, a retrospective analysis was carried out to identify which factors {{could be the best}} indicators for a residential or a semi-residential placement. Sample and methodology. The sample consists of 102 adolescents referred to the daily Semi-residential Service for Adolescents (77 males and 25 females, aged between 12 and 18 years). It was later on divided into two groups: one group stayed in the Semi-residential Service and the second group went into a <b>residential</b> child <b>care</b> <b>institution.</b> All the patients were assessed using the Youth Self report (YSR 11 - 18) and the Global Assessment Functioning Scale (GAF) when admitted to the Service, and 6 months further on. For each patient the following data were collected: personal and familiar details, schooling, diagnosis, therapeutic objectives, collaboration of {{the adolescent}} and his/her family to the treatment and type of intervention. All the data were analysed and compared to find out which could indicate the best early placement for the patient (Semi-residential or residential). Results and conclusions. From this study, it emerges that the <b>residential</b> child <b>care</b> <b>institution</b> is more indicated for the adolescents with: age below 14 years old, monoparental family, externalizing problems (delinquent and aggressive behaviour, conduct or personality disorders), a poor therapeutical compliance (in particular during the first 6 months in the Semi-residential Service) and a lack of parental collaboratio...|$|R
40|$|This thesis studies <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> {{for young}} persons (13 - 18 years of age) with {{emotional}} and behavioural problems. An overall {{aim is to}} examine and describe different aspects of <b>residential</b> <b>care.</b> The thesis consists of five papers based on two different studies. Papers I and II use data from a survey of <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> for young persons in Sweden. Papers III, IV and V use data from a research study concerning a single treatment home. In Paper I different settings in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> in Sweden are compared according {{to the problems of}} the youths in care, the mean length of stay in care, staff characteristics and aspects of the care and treatment provided. In Paper II different approaches to <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> are identified and related to characteristics of the home, the staff and the type of care. Paper III explores careworkers’ perceptions of treatment. Paper IV explores adolescents’ experiences of living in <b>residential</b> <b>care.</b> Paper V illustrates and illuminates how relationships between careworkers and young persons in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> can be perceived. It was found in Paper I that institutions run by the public sector have better educated staff and a higher staff-resident ratio than privately run institutions. Despite this, they were more restrictive in their intake and had youths with fewer problems, especially delinquency and other antisocial behaviours. In Paper II it was possible to identify five different approaches to care and treatment. These approaches did not exclude each other but were agreed with to different extents by different homes. The approaches were found {{to be related to the}} variety within <b>residential</b> <b>care.</b> In Paper III six different intentions in the care delivered could be identified. The distribution of each careworker’s statements created a pattern that illustrated the careworkers’ general treatment perceptions. This pattern made it possible to study and compare different careworkers’ perceptions of treatment. Paper IV shows that living in the same institution during the same time period does not mean sharing the same experiences. In retrospect, the experiences of the six young persons were very different from each other. Three of them, the girls, expressed great discontent with the stay. The three boys were more positive. Paper V shows that relational factors can play a great part in how young persons experience their stay in a residential institution. The mutual trust between the young person and the careworker can be an important foundation for the treatment process. Likewise, difficulties in the relationship between the young person and the careworker can contribute to mistrust and dropout from care. In conclusion, diversity in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> was found on multiple levels in the studies in this thesis: on the individual level, the interactional level, and on contextual levels such as settings and approaches to treatment. It was also found that some of these differences, for example careworkers’ perception of treatment and institutions’ approaches to treatment, are not only possible to describe but also to “measure”. Key words: <b>Residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions,</b> youth, staff, settings, approaches to treatment, experiences in car...|$|R

UNICEF has been actively advocating for increased support to vulnerable families that will allow children placed in orphanages to return to their families and will also prevent future placement of children in public care institutions.UNICEF has also successfully introduced foster care concept in Armenia, whereby children are placed with foster parents under conditions when they either have no family or cannot return to their own family.To prevent placement of children in public <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> at community level, UNICEF supported local NGOs in establishment of community-based care centers for children at-risk, children with special needs and children from vulnerable families.UNICEF was one of the first organizations to initiate studies into the phenomenon of trafficking in women and children from Armenia.In 2003, UNICEF published a survey into child abuse and neglect. The survey revealed cases of violence and abuse against children in communities, families and institutions. UNICEF has been working hard to disseminate information to parents and children and provide training to teachers, police, social workers, nurses and doctors for them to be able to prevent and respond to cases of violence against children.By supporting revision of the juvenile justice system, UNICEF has also promoted positive legislative changes including the introduction of alternative systems such as probation.|$|R
40|$|Background. Runaway {{behavior}} among children in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> {{is a serious}} social problem in all countries of the world. Existing scientific data on risk factors and motives of runaway from out-of-home care may not be absolutely relevant to the Russian cultural context. Objective. To describe risk factors and the motives that cause children to runaway from <b>residential</b> <b>care.</b> Design. A qualitative study that included 2 focus groups with staff and graduates of <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> supplemented by the analysis of 23 cases of child runaways from <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> in St. Petersburg. Results. The study revealed the following runaway risk factors and motives: 1) running to parents or relatives, 2) romantic and/or sexual relations, 3) interaction with peers, 4) psychiatric problems, 5) addictive behavior, 6) avoidance of conflicts, 7) physical or emotional violence, 8) unmotivated runaways for entertainment, 9) problems adapting to the <b>care</b> <b>institution,</b> 10) dissatisfaction with the conditions at the <b>care</b> <b>institution.</b> Moreover, in this study, {{two different types of}} runaways have been identified, including relatively “true” runaways and those who are not psychologically experienced as such, but are only disobeying the formal rules of the <b>care</b> <b>institution.</b> Conclusions. Runaways of children from <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> are extremely heterogeneous in nature. In further empirical studies, it should be taken into account that runaways may be true and formal. There can be multiple reasons for running away: the <b>care</b> <b>institution</b> itself, a child’s personality, or his or her social network outside of the <b>care</b> <b>institution...</b>|$|R
40|$|Although the {{workload}} of family caregivers {{has been a}} core topic in society, these problems are still underestimated when planning support for them. The objectives {{of this study were}} to show how family caregivers experience daily life when they care for a spouse at home, and to elucidate their daily life when utilizing <b>residential</b> respite <b>care.</b> Eighteen caregivers > 65 years old who cared for spouses with neurological disorders were interviewed. Content analysis was used. Two main themes emerged: ´Developing a role as family caregiver´ and ´Satisfaction with daily life depends on the quality of care their spouse received´. Family caregivers’ experiences of daily life at home involved helping their spouses with basic needs and meaningful activities. When they handed over responsibility to <b>residential</b> respite <b>care</b> <b>institution</b> they sometimes felt guilty to leave their spouse there. Continuous information and communication regarding their spouse’s health and confirmation of good quality of care was of great importance for their own well-being. Otherwise they could not make use of the relief period to recover from their caring role. The role of the family caregiver was complex. They need continuous education and support to feel satisfied with their daily life...|$|R
40|$|Group <b>care</b> {{workers in}} <b>residential</b> youth <b>care</b> are {{considered}} important in influencing behavioral development of children. In spite of this, their role {{has largely been}} neglected in research on <b>residential</b> <b>care.</b> The aim {{of the current study}} was twofold. First, longitudinal changes in group care worker interventions and child behaviors were investigated separately. Second, bidirectional influences between group care worker interventions and child behaviors were investigated. Group care workers completed the Group care worker Intervention Checklist and Child Behavior Checklist for 128 children (66 % boys, mean age 8. 63 years) {{at the beginning of the}} treatment and at two measurement intervals that followed (6 and 12 months, respectively). Most results contradicted the predictions. There was no change in controlling and warm and supportive interventions by group care workers. Autonomy granting interventions increased during treatment. Second, there were no changes in externalizing and internalizing behaviors of children over time. Third, cross-lagged analyses revealed that higher levels of controlling interventions increased externalizing problems of children. In the opposite direction, higher levels of children's externalizing problems were associated with an increase in controlling interventions of group care workers. In addition, higher levels of children's internalizing problems were associated with lower subsequent levels of autonomy granting interventions. These significant longitudinal paths were found only for the first phase of treatment. This study emphasizes the potential of the role of group <b>care</b> workers in <b>residential</b> youth <b>care.</b> <b>Residential</b> <b>institutions</b> should be aware of the dynamics between group care workers and children. Training and ongoing supervision in effective responses to behavior problems can increase the effect of group care worker interventions on child behavioral changes...|$|R

40|$|Poster Session - Risk, QoL & Life-Course Factors: no. 349 OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} the oral health related behaviors and oral {{health status of}} Hong Kong adults with intellectual disability (ID) residing in institutions. METHODS: Systematic sampling was used to select 16 out of the 96 government-subsidized <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>institutions</b> for adults (aged > 17 years) with ID. All adults with mild to severe ID were invited. Background and oral health related behavior information was obtained from questionnaire, while data on oral health status were obtained from oral examination. RESULTS: In 2015, a total of 255 subjects (156 men, 99 women) from 8 institutions participated in this study. Most (62 %) of the subjects were aged 18 - 44 years. Nearly half (47 %) of the subjects were at moderate grade of ID. Most of them (87 %) brushed their teeth twice or more {{times a day and}} 67 % had sugary snacks less than once a day. Two-thirds (65 %) had regular dental check-up and 68 % had their last visit within 1 year. The mean DT, MT, FT and DMFT scores of the 18 - 44 year-old group were 0. 4 ± 1. 1, 3. 7 ± 5. 8, 1. 5 ± 2. 2 and 5. 6 ± 6. 7; and those of the 45 - 77 year-old group were 0. 3 ± 0. 7, 12. 8 ± 9. 4, 1. 2 ± 1. 5 and 14. 2 ± 9. 3. There mean MT and DMFT scores of the older group were significantly higher than those of the younger group (p 5 mm. The differences in periodontal status between the two age groups were not statistically significant (p> 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Hong Kong institutionalized adults with ID had satisfactory oral health related behaviors and their oral health status was similar to the general population. Missing teeth was common in this population group but not untreated decayed or filled teeth. Their gingival health was poor but deep periodontal pockets were not common...|$|R
