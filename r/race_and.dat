40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how to best promote, execute, and manage {{traditional}} foot <b>racing</b> <b>and</b> obstacle <b>racing</b> in the 21 st century. Accurately measured traditional foot racing has been in existence since the 1600 s (“Running History Story”). Much more recently, in 1990, obstacle <b>racing</b> originated <b>and</b> brought change to the racing industry (“The History of Obstacle Races”). As a result, this study investigated the two different cultures of traditional foot <b>racing</b> <b>and</b> obstacle <b>racing,</b> <b>and</b> what the introduction of obstacle racing means for racing coordinators of both types of events. A mixed methods study was conducted to examine this situation. 100 traditional foot <b>race</b> participants <b>and</b> 100 obstacle <b>race</b> participants were surveyed at <b>races</b> <b>and</b> through relevant social media regarding: demographic background of both traditional foot racers and obstacle racers, feelings toward traditional foot <b>racing</b> <b>and</b> obstacle <b>racing,</b> drivers of behavior to race traditional foot <b>races</b> <b>and</b> obstacle <b>races,</b> the frequency of engagement in both traditional foot <b>races</b> <b>and</b> obstacle <b>races,</b> <b>and</b> with whom traditional foot <b>race</b> competitors <b>and</b> obstacle <b>race</b> competitors decide to race. Expert interviews were also conducted to supplement survey findings and to gather expert opinions on both traditional foot <b>racing</b> <b>and</b> obstacle <b>racing.</b> The findings from this study are important because they provide race directors of both traditional foot <b>racing</b> <b>and</b> obstacle <b>racing</b> with a foundation upon which to plan future races. Obstacle racing has impacted the industry, but not to the determent of traditional foot racing. Instead, a new demographic of young, single early professionals have emerged to run obstacle races; compared to the older, established business professional traditional foot racing demographic. Each of these demographics brings their own varied set of wants and needs to traditional foot <b>racing</b> <b>and</b> obstacle <b>racing.</b> These findings are translated into product, place, price, and promotion suggestions that race directors of both events can receive guidance from when planning races...|$|R
