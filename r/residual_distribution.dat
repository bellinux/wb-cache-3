40|$|The <b>residual</b> <b>distribution</b> {{framework}} {{and its ability}} to carry out genuinely multidimensional upwinding has attracted a lot of research interest in the past three decades. Although not as robust as other widely used approximate methods for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations, when <b>residual</b> <b>distribution</b> schemes do provide a plausible solution it is usually more accurate than in the case of other approaches. Extending these methods to time-dependent problems remains one of the main challenges in the field. In particular, constructing such a solution so that the resulting discretisation exhibits all the desired properties available in the steady state setting. It is generally agreed that there is not yet an ideal generalisation of second order accurate and positive compact <b>residual</b> <b>distribution</b> schemes designed within the steady <b>residual</b> <b>distribution</b> framework to time-dependent problems. Various approaches exist, none of which is considered optimal nor completely satisfactory. In this thesis two possible extensions are constructed, analysed and verified numerically: continuous-in-space and discontinuous-in-space Runge-Kutta <b>Residual</b> <b>Distribution</b> methods. In both cases a Runge-Kutta-type time-stepping method is used to integrate the underlying PDEs in time. These are then combined with, respectively, a continuous- and discontinuous-in-space <b>residual</b> <b>distribution</b> type spatial approximation. In this work a number of second order accurate linear continuous-in-space Runge- Kutta <b>residual</b> <b>distribution</b> methods are constructed, tested experimentally and compared with existing approaches. Additionally, one non-linear second order accurate scheme is presented and verified. This scheme is shown to perform better in the close vicinity of discontinuities (in terms of producing spurious oscillations) when compared to linear second order schemes. The experiments are carried out on a set of structured and unstructured triangular meshes for both scalar linear and nonlinear equations, and for the Euler equations of fluid dynamics as an example of systems of non-linear equations. In the case of the discontinuous-in-space Runge-Kutta <b>residual</b> <b>distribution</b> framework, the thorough analysis presented here highlights a number of shortcomings of this approach and shows that it is not as attractive as initially anticipated. Nevertheless, a rigorous overview of this approach is given. Extensive numerical results on both structured and unstructured triangular meshes confirm the analytical results. Only results for scalar (both linear and non-linear) equations are presented...|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} a discontinuous implementation of <b>residual</b> <b>distribution</b> for shallow-water flows. The emphasis {{is put on}} the space-time implementation of <b>residual</b> <b>distribution</b> for the time-dependent system of equations with discontinuity in time only. This lifts the time-step restriction that even implicit continuous <b>residual</b> <b>distribution</b> schemes invariably suffer from, and thus leads to an unconditionally stable discretisation. The distributions are the space-time variants of the upwind distributions for the steady-state system of equations and are designed to satisfy the most important properties of the original mathematical equations: positivity, linearity preservation, conservation and hydrostatic balance. The purpose of the several numerical examples {{presented in this article}} is twofold. First, to show that the discontinuous numerical discretisation does indeed exhibit all the desired properties when applied to the shallow-water equations. Second, to investigate how much the time step can be increased without adversely affecting the accuracy of the scheme and whether this translates into gains in computational efficiency. Comparison to other existing <b>residual</b> <b>distribution</b> schemes is also provided to demonstrate the improved performance of the scheme...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In cutting field, <b>residual</b> stress <b>distribution</b> {{analysis}} on the workpiece {{is a very interesting}} topic. Indeed, the <b>residual</b> stress <b>distribution</b> affects fatigue life, corrosion resistance and other functional aspects of the workpiece. Recent studies showed that the development of residual stresses is influenced by the cutting parameters, tool geometry and workpiece material. For reducing the costs of experimental tests and residual stress measurement, analytical and numerical models have been developed. The aim of these models is the possibility of forecasting the <b>residual</b> stress <b>distribution</b> into the workpiece {{as a function of the}} selected process parameters.

40|$|International audienceThe {{interest}} on Immersed Boundary Methods (IBM) is increasing in Computational Fluid Dynamics as they simplify the mesh generation problem. In this work, we consider an approach {{based on the}} addition of a penalty term to the Navier–Stokes equations to account for the wall boundary conditions. To discretize the resulting equations we use a <b>residual</b> <b>distribution</b> approach previously developed by some of the authors. To adapt the method to the IBM considered, we developed a new formulation of <b>residual</b> <b>distribution</b> based on a Strang splitting method in time, coupling an implicit asymptotic integration procedure of the penalization ODE with a simplified explicit <b>residual</b> <b>distribution</b> for the Navier–Stokes equations. The first method, provides an operator which is exact up to orders η 2, with η the penalty parameter assuming values of the order of 10 − 10. A modification of the solution gradient reconstruction necessary for the evaluation of the viscous fluxes, is also introduced in the paper. This guarantees that correct physical values of the viscous stresses are recovered in vicinity of the solid. We show formally and numerically that the approach proposed is second order accurate for smooth solutions. We evaluate its potential for IBM by coupling the resulting method with unstructured mesh adaptation on wall boundaries. Several steady and time dependent tests are used to show the promising features of the method proposed...|$|E
