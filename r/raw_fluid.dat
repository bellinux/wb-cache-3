40|$|AbstractThis work, {{describes}} for {{the first}} time, a simple biosensing design to yield an ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor for a cancer biomarker detection, miRNA- 155, with linear response down to the attomolar range. MiRNA- 155 was selected for being overexpressed in breast cancer. The biosensor was assembled in two stages: (1) the immobilization of the anti-miRNA- 155 that was thiol modified on an Au-screen printed electrode (Au-SPE), followed by (2) blocking the areas of non-specific binding with mercaptosuccinic acid. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electrochemical techniques including cyclic voltammetry (CV), impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and square wave voltammetry (SWV) confirmed the surface modification of these devices {{and their ability to}} hybridize successfully and stably with miRNA- 155. The final biosensor provided a sensitive detection of miRNA- 155 from 10 aM to 1. 0 nM with a low detection limit (LOD) of 5. 7 aM in real human serum samples. Good results were obtained in terms of selectivity towards breast cancer antigen CA- 15. 3 and bovine serum albumin (BSA). <b>Raw</b> <b>fluid</b> extracts from cell-lines of melanoma did not affect the biosensor response (no significant change of the blank), while raw extracts from breast cancer yielded a positive signal against miRNA- 155.

According to each experimental condition, PBS or BQ 788 was intravenously injected into mice prior to intraperitoneal administration of fecal fluid or PBS. All groups of mice were sacrificed at 8 h after administration, and then brain samples were prepared. Key findingsIn the ESM group, an increase of apoptotic neuroblasts was demonstrated in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, enhanced expression of c-FOS was observed in arginine-vasopressin-containing neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, and various cytokines involving TNF-α were upregulated in the brain, compared {{with those in the}} PBS group.

Most strains of E. coli O 157 :H 7 are unable to ferment sorbitol; therefore, we assessed whether the addition of sorbitol as the only added carbohydrate {{could be used to}} competitively exclude E. coli O 157 :H 7 from the culture system. When inoculated into raw rumen broth containing 3 g of sorbitol per liter, E. coli O 157 :H 7 was displaced within 72 h. The addition of other competitive sugars, such as l-arabinose, trehalose, and rhamnose, to rumen medium gave similar results. However, whenever E. coli O 157 :H 7 was grown in sterile rumen broth containing sorbitol, sorbitol-positive mutants appeared. These results suggest that a robust population of commensal ruminal microflora is required to invoke competitive exclusion of E. coli O 157 :H 7 by the addition of “nonfermentable” sugars and that this approach may be effective as a preharvest strategy for reducing carriage of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in the rumen...|$|R

The pipeline was commissioned in 1994 and a metal loss inspection with an intelligent pig was successfully completed in 1997. Video inspections {{of the pipeline}} conducted in recent years indicated a significant deposition of scale in the topside and riser pipework at the Dunbar platform. Initial attempts to assess {{the extent of the}} scale build-up in the risers and pipeline were only partially successful, and by the summer of 2003 the deposition was estimated to have restricted the remaining internal diameter {{at the top of the}} riser to less than 10 ”. By late 2003 TOTAL required that a further metal loss inspection be conducted in 2004. To enable an intelligent pig inspection of the pipeline, it was necessary that it be cleaned of scale. To enable the formulation of a cleaning methodology that minimised the risk of blocking the pipeline during cleaning, it was critical that further details be established as to the quantity and distribution of the scale within the pipeline.

40|$|<b>Fluid</b> <b>raw</b> milk {{has become}} one of the largest {{agricultural}} commodities, as measured by gross sales, produced in the United States. Since the federal government began to loosen its control over dairy prices in the early 1980 ’s, farm level milk prices have seen dramatic increases in volatility. Further, shrinking profit margins are requiring more and more dairy farmers to carry a significant amount of debt. Because of the greater leverage in the industry and reduced government support, many producers desire to find mechanisms by which to reduce price risk. Class III milk futures began trading in 1996 with an objective to provide dairy industry players with a means to reduce price risk by transferring that risk to other market players or speculators. Numerous strategies have been proposed for dairy producers to use in price risk reduction that industry participants both support and denounce. One of the objectives of this thesis was to list and analyze a select number of these strategies for their risk-reducing features.

40|$|The dairy {{industry}} is recently facing a quality problem {{due to the}} presence of sporeformer bacteria in different products. These bacteria are members mainly of the Bacillus taxonomic group and due to their abilities to survive pasteurization, can not be controlled by this process technology. Consequently, this bacteria population affects the quality of some products during storage (e. g. fluid milk) and limit their potential markets (e. g. milk powder). Since no technology/interventions are currently available to eliminate this bacteria type once they enter the milk chain, the identification of their entry points and sources is essential information to design potential interventions to control them at early stages. In order to address this issue, this research focused on identifying those “problematic” sporeforming bacteria across the milk chain (from sources at farm level, <b>raw</b> milk, <b>fluid</b> milk and condensed milk) using DNA-based methods (rpoB or 16 S). Moreover, associations affecting their entrance into the milk chain were also studied, including weather and potential farm practices. The identification of problematic sporeformers suggests that Paenibacillus spp. are responsible for spoilage of fluid milk due to their ability to grow and survive the processing conditions encountered during pasteurization and condensation. Other Bacillus species found in condensed milk include: B. claussi, B. subtilis, Lysinibacillus sp., B. safensis, B. licheniformis, B. sonorensis and Brevibacillus spp. These last three species are capable of growing at thermophilic temperatures (55 °C) being potential problematic for the milk powder industry. Therefore, contamination of other dairy products could occur when condensed milk is used as ingredient. When evaluating the raw milk at the farm level, no seasonal effect was associated with the prevalence of sporeformers bacteria; however, farms seems to have an effect. Among the sources of problematic strains at the farm, it was found that milking equipment and cow teats are associated {{with a wide variety of}} psychrotrophic and thermophilic problematic strains, suggesting that any interventions at farm level should be targeting these areas. By better understanding the potential sources, scientists and farmers could design and implement suitable interventions to decrease sporeformer counts in raw milk improving the quality of dairy products. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{high-throughput}} protein analysis {{platform with}} integrated sample preparation is developed {{to address the}} identified technology gaps in biomarker validation, clinical and point-of-care diagnostics. The goals of the technology are to automate and integrate protein sample preparation with electrokinetic separations, implement immunoassays capable of processing <b>raw</b> biological <b>fluids,</b> and perform high-throughput protein assays targeted for disease diagnosis. Integration of multiple functions is a hallmark of microfluidic tools. Efforts to fully incorporate required sample preparation steps within electrokinetic assays would benefit from a surge in technology development. On-chip fluorescence labeling, analyte enrichment, buffer exchange, reagent-sample mixing and matrix protein depletion are essential to realize the "sample-to-answer" paradigm of lab-on-a-chip systems for targeted proteomics [...] which {{hold the key to}} rigorous validation of potentially high impact biomarkers relevant for drug discovery, clinical diagnostics, and patient therapy and monitoring. Integration of sample preparation techniques would also expand the protein analysis application space to point-of-care assays in low resource settings. Presently, introduction of in-situ fabrication methods has enabled advances in integration of multiple reaction zones into microfluidic geometries. Fabrication is performed at the microscale using chemically and physical functionalized polyacrylamide gels photo-patterned on microfluidic chips. These zones facilitate precise control of assay performance parameters including sample resolution, background noise, dynamic range, binding kinetics, and dispersion among others while taking advantage of microscale interactions to reduce assay time, cost, and reagent consumption while increasing sensitivity, and portability. In this dissertation several novel techniques for on-chip proteomics and immunoassays with integrated sample preparation are introduced for the analysis of serum or proximal fluids. These methods are applied to develop laboratory medicine and point-of-care assays for the following applications: 1) immunosubtraction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for detection of protein mobility and binding specificity, 2) on-chip fluorogenic labeling integrated with native electrophoresis for mass isoform detection, 3) low molecular weight compound sandwich fragment antibody assays for detecting drugs of abuse, 4) integrated enrichment and labeling of proteins facilitated with size-exclusion membranes, 5) cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea detection for emergency room screening of traumatic brain injury, and 6) rapid single-step electrophoretic and isotachophoretic immunoassays for serum Hepatitis C confirmatory diagnostics.

These papillae are, I believe, rudiments of formerly existing tentacles together with their glands. Many experiments were made to ascertain whether the {{backs of the}} leaves could be irritated in any way, thirty-seven leaves being thus tried. Some were rubbed for a long time with a blunt needle, and drops of milk and other exciting <b>fluids,</b> <b>raw</b> meat, crushed flies, and various substances, placed on others.

I also kept some leaves, on the backs of which exciting objects had been placed, under a damp bell-glass; but with all my care I never saw any true movement. I was led to make so many trials because, contrary to my previous experience, Nitschke states* that, after affixing objects to the backs of leaves by the aid of the viscid secretion, he repeatedly saw the tentacles (and in one instance the blade) become reflexed. This movement, if a true one, would be most anomalous; for it implies that the tentacles receive a motor impulse from an unnatural source, and have the power of bending in a direction exactly the reverse of that which is habitual to them; this power not being of the least use to the plant, as insects cannot adhere to the smooth backs of the leaves.|$|R
40|$|Performing gas {{compression}} subsea is {{an important}} component for future realisation of complete subsea processing facilities. Gas compressors operating with <b>raw</b> well <b>fluids,</b> categorised as wet gas, enables an increase in hydrocarbon recovery and operational efficiency together with cost reduction for extended subsea processing. The wet gas, defined with a liquid fraction up to 5 %, implies challenges for existing dry gas compressor technology. To accurately predict compressor performance with wet gas and enable efficient control, research leading to first principle modelling of wet gas compressors is important. The work in this thesis expands upon the specialisation project work in the autumn of 2016. The main objectives are to establish performance characteristics of a compressor, validate dry gas compressor models through simulation and expand the models towards simulation and control with emulated wet gas flow. Two compressor characteristics have been curve fitted to a Garett GT 2252 turbocharger compressor map. The turbocharger is stationed in the Wet Gas Compression laboratory at the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at NTNU. The map characteristics were curve fitted with two different methods in MATLAB. The least squares non-linear fit for a first principle characteristic function and with a traditional empirical 3 rd-degree polynomial, commonly used in literature. The latter curve fit method produced the best fit in terms of mean absolute error. The two characteristics have been validated in simulation with two compressor models, the axial compressor model developed by Greitzer and the centrifugal compressor model developed by Gravdahl. Through a controller tuning study, a non-linear gain scheduling controller has been developed for the normal operating region of the compressor. Two 3 rd-degree polynomials, calculated offline, are used for continuously updating each controller setting in the scheduling algorithm. The performance results of the gain scheduling controller have proven to reduce the integral of absolute value of control error compared to a single linear controller for setpoint and load disturbance changes. The controller has been subject to testing with model uncertainties, by interchanging the first principle with the empirical compressor characteristic in the model. The first principle compressor characteristic has been extended with the application of wet gas parameters. The inlet gas density, gas specific heat capacity and impeller friction loss factor are empirically calculated with changing gas volume fraction of the gas flow. Gas volume fractions of 100 % to 99. 90 % and corresponding gas mass fractions of 100 % to 54. 67 % are used to simulate a wet gas compressor using the gain scheduling controller. This has been performed to validate the controller robustness. The results of utilising the wet gas compressor characteristic in simulation have shown a decrease in achievable pressure ratio and an earlier saturation of the drive unit to maximum speed for the compressor. The author has contributed to the electrical installation on the Department Wet Gas Compression laboratory. Electrical installation schematics and an operation protocol have been produced to complete the laboratory documentation.

Methods: Two hundred sixty-two elective AAA repairs were retrospectively reviewed for preoperative and intraoperative risk factors. Core temperature, age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and APACHE III scores (<b>raw</b> and temperature-adjusted), <b>fluid</b> resuscitation, and perioperative organ dysfunction were recorded prospectively. Outcome measures included lengths of stay {{in the intensive care unit}} and in the hospital, and hospital mortality rates. Results: Except for a higher risk of hypothermia in women (p < 0. 05), by univariate analysis, preoperative risk factors were similar in patients in the hypothermic and normothermic groups. After operation, patients with hypothermia had significantly greater APACHE scores (p < 0. 0001), and patients in the hypothermic nonsurvivor group took significantly longer to rewarm (p < 0. 05), suggesting marked hypoperfusion. Patients with hypothermia had significantly greater fluid (p < 0. 05), transfusion (p < 0. 01), vasopressor (p < 0. 05), and inotrope (p < 0. 05) requirements, resulting in significantly higher incidences of organ dysfunction (53. 0 % vs 28. 7 %, p < 0. 01) and death (12. 1 % vs 1. 5 %, p < 0. 01) and markedly prolonged lengths of stay in the unit (9. 2 ± 2. 0 vs 5. 3 ± 0. 6, p < 0. 05) and in the hospital (24. 3 ± 2. 9 vs 15. 0 ± 0. 08, p < 0. 01). By multivariate analysis, female gender (p = 0. 004) was the only predictor of intraoperative hypothermia, whereas initial hypothermia was significantly predictive of both prolonged hypothermia and development of organ failure (p < 0. 05). Organ failure (p < 0. 05) and acute myocardial infarction (p < 0. 01) were independent predictors of death. Conclusions: After AAA repair, patients with hypothermia have multiple physiologic derangements associated with adverse outcomes. Although multiple etiologic factors are interacting, body temperature is one variable that should be controlled during aortic surgery. (J VASC SURG 1995; 21 : 392 - 402. ...|$|R
