5|$|Puk, the {{organizer}} of the first massacre, was captured by British forces while attempting to flee to Austria in May 1945 and was extradited to Yugoslavia several months later, where he committed suicide by slitting his wrists with a <b>razor</b> <b>blade.</b> Luburić, {{the organizer}} of the second massacre, escaped Yugoslavia {{after the war and}} moved to fascist Spain, where he was assassinated by a person generally assumed to have been an agent of the Yugoslav State Security Service (UDBA). Pavelić survived the war and died in Spain in 1959. Stepinac, who failed to publicly condemn the atrocities in Glina, was accused of collaborating with the Ustaše by Yugoslavia's new Communist government and was tried in 1946, where Jednak testified against him. He was subsequently sentenced to sixteen years imprisonment and died while under house arrest in 1960. In 1986, Jednak testified against the Ustaše government's Minister of the Interior, Andrija Artuković, at his trial in Croatia.|$|E

A {{non-linear}} resistance {{property of the}} blued steel of <b>razor</b> <b>blades,</b> foreshadowing the same property that would later be discovered in semiconductor diode junctions, along with the ready availability of blued steel <b>razor</b> <b>blades,</b> led {{to the use of}} <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> as a detector in the crystal set AM radios which were often built by soldiers during World War II.|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{infection}} {{ranks among}} the most devastating health problems in the world. The most probable transmission routes of HBV are blood contact, sexual, and horizontal transfer. Other sources of HBV transmission are razor sharing, beauty treatments, tattooing, piercing, and manicures and other chiropody treatments. Many infections {{have been reported in}} South-East Asia, where barbers commonly share and reuse razors. Detection of HBV DNA in contaminated devices such as <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> is important in the demonstration of transmission routes and indirect estimation of HBV prevalence in specific subpopulations such as barbershop clientele. Therefore, we aimed to detect the presence of HBV contamination on <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> by nucleic acid testing. Methods: Used <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> (n = 151) were purchased from different barber’s shops. Used <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> purchased from chronic HBV patients (n = 8) were included as a positive control. The amplification and detection of HBV DNA was carried out by a semi-nested PCR method in a thermal cycler. Results: The presence of HBV DNA was found in 10 (6. 6 %) used razor-blade samples by the detection of a specific positive band with agarose gel electrophoresis. Conclusions: In conclusion, used <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> may be contaminated with HBV, and the practice of sharing used <b>razor</b> <b>blades</b> may pose a risk of transmission. Nucleic acid detection methods involving PCR can be used to detect HBV contamination of <b>razor</b> <b>blades.</b> HBV control and prevention programs should educate barbers about the importance of contagious diseases, proper sterilization techniques, and avoiding reuse and sharing of contaminated equipment and supplies such as <b>razor</b> <b>blades.</b> As an infection control measure, prohibition of razor reuse can reduce the spread of HBV infection in rural areas, where the practice is often common at barbershops...|$|R

5|$|The {{success of}} Gaalipata turned Ganesh {{into one of}} the most sought-after actors in Kannada cinema. He was already coming on the back of major {{commercial}} successes Mungaru Male (2006), Cheluvina Chittara (2007), and moderate successes Hudugaata (2007) and Krishna (2007). Yogaraj Bhat had delivered his two consecutive films that emerged as massive commercial successes, the other being Mungaru Male. Ganesh was seen in the film wearing a chain around the neck with a <b>razor</b> <b>blade</b> as the pendant. It became a trend among male fans. The film also proved to as a major break for Diganth who would go on to collaborate with Bhat frequently— Manasaare (2009), Pancharangi (2010) and Parapancha (2015). The nickname 'Doodh Peda' (an Indian sweet), by which Ganesh addresses to him as, in the film, came to be attached with his name in the media along with a tag of 'Chocolate Hero'. The film also proved to be a launchpad in the careers of actresses Neethu and Bhavana Rao.|$|E

The following year, Nilsen was transferred to a vulnerable-prisoner unit at HMP Full Sutton upon concerns for his safety. He was to remain at Full Sutton until 1993, when he was transferred to Whitemoor Prison, again as a Category A prisoner, and with increased segregation from other inmates.|$|E

Jackson's mission was to assess Ireland's {{readiness}} for revolution and French invasion. Jackson, Tone, and others met in Hamilton Rowan's Newgate cell to discuss the state of Ireland and the population's willingness to overthrow British rule. But Jackson was betrayed by a friend acting as a spy for the British Government, {{was arrested and charged with}} high treason. Immediately following Jackson's arrest, Hamilton Rowan fled to escape being tried for high treason. He convinced his jailer to allow him to visit his wife on the pretense of signing legal documents. While the jailer sat in the dining room of their home in Dublin, Hamilton Rowan excused himself to the bedroom, where he climbed down a rope made of knotted bed sheets to a waiting horse. Unwilling to be taken alive, he kept a <b>razor</b> <b>blade</b> in his sleeve and fled south to the coast. There he hired a boat to sail to France, and upon his arrival he was immediately arrested as a British spy. While in prison he was interrogated by Robespierre, who found him innocent of the charges raised against him and had Hamilton Rowan freed.|$|E
25|$|Not every suicide {{case was}} successful. Some mothers who had drowned their {{children}} were unable to drown themselves thereafter. In other cases, doses of poison proved to be lethal for children, but not for their mothers. There were also cases where children survived attempted drownings. After a failed suicide, some killed themselves by others methods. A mother and her repeatedly raped daughter, for instance, died by hanging themselves in an attic, after repeatedly failing to drown themselves in the Peene river. Another mother who had poisoned and buried three of her four children before, tried to hang herself on an oak three times, only to be prevented to do so each time by Soviet soldiers. There are further records of Soviet soldiers preventing suicides by retrieving people from the river and nursing cut wrists. In another case, a grandfather forcibly took away a <b>razor</b> <b>blade</b> from a mother {{who was about to}} kill her children and herself after being raped by Soviet soldiers and hearing of the death of her husband. After Soviet soldiers had raped a girl to death and shot her father, an aunt cut her daughter's and son's wrists as well as her own. The other women of the family committed suicide, only one aunt was able to save the grandmother. One family survived, because the 15-year-old son persuaded his mother, who had become a rape victim, to abort her induced drowning, when she was already being dragged by the Tollense river.|$|E

500|$|Self-harm (SH), also {{referred}} to as self-injury (SI), self-inflicted violence (SIV), nonsuicidal self injury (NSSI) or self-injurious behaviour (SIB), refers to a spectrum of behaviours where demonstrable injury is self-inflicted. The behaviour involves deliberate tissue damage that is usually performed without suicidal intent. [...] The most common form of self-harm involves cutting of the skin using a sharp object, e. g. a knife or <b>razor</b> <b>blade.</b> The term self-mutilation is also sometimes used, although this phrase evokes connotations that some find worrisome, inaccurate, or offensive. Self-inflicted wounds is a specific term associated with soldiers to describe non-lethal injuries inflicted in order to obtain early dismissal from combat. This differs from the common definition of self-harm, as damage is inflicted for a specific secondary purpose. A broader definition of self-harm might also include those who inflict harm on their bodies by means of disordered eating.|$|E
