Also unlike the original, Puzzle Link 2 features minor thematic elements conveyed through short cutscenes—all centering around the protagonist (Ace) acquiring collectible cards from other characters. Further differences from the campaign of Puzzle Link include the addition of a gameplay tutorial and the removal of difficulty options.|$|R

Eine Moore, who has been working on the mass of excavated earthenware from Tapadong (Moore 1966), has drawn my attention to an earth-enware lid now reconstructed and readily identifiable from Tapadong Cave, the original type site of the "turtle-ware " (Fig. I).

5000|$|The {{most obvious}} {{features}} of the Palpimanidae are the front legs, which are disproportionately powerful and heavily sclerotised. The abdomen is <b>round</b> to oval, <b>evenly</b> sprinkled with short straight hairs that in some species are sufficiently dense to form a close-fitting coat, though most species look nearly smooth. Usually the cephalothorax is somewhat less obviously hairy. The abdomen is <b>evenly</b> <b>rounded</b> without conspicuous sculpting, and in many species is elongated into an olive shape {{twice as long as}} the cephalothorax, giving the spider a vaguely torpedo-shaped appearance. Instead of having six spinnerets like most spiders, the Palpimanidae have only two. Colour patterns generally are subdued and simple. A few genera, such as Diaphorocellus have light patches on a dark abdomen. Most others are brownish or reddish to dark in general colour, but as a rule the cephalothorax is more heavily sclerotised and darker than the abdomen, as well as glossier. There are eight eyes in two rows of four, but in some species the outer anterior and posterior eyes are close together, which has caused some people to think there are just six eyes. In some species the chelicerae have stimulatory organs, microscopic ridges, with pegs that scrape over them when they rub the chelicerae together. The probable function is to signal to each other in mating, though it might have some defensive role as well.|$|R
