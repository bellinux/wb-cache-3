A design for a small-scale wind concentrator device suitable for use in areas of low wind velocity was tested using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Using a novel approach, the device seeks to accelerate incoming air above minimum velocities required for economical power generation. The novel approach employs a funnel shaped inlet with <b>relief</b> <b>vents</b> along the circumference, so as to alleviate backpressure. Both inlet and outlet sections utilize funnel shapes with both parabolic and hyperbolic regions. All geometry and mesh models were created using ICEM 12. 1. Simulations were performed using Fluent 12. 1. 2. Turbulence was modeled using the standard k-epsilon model. All mesh models contained roughly 500, 000 unstructured computational cells. CFD simulations predict a 2. 53 X acceleration of incoming air through the throat of the device (based upon a 2 m/s ambient wind speed). Similar performance was seen across the range of 1 - 12 m/s. Analysis focused on testing various designs to reduce losses due to turbulent energy and backpressure, with a focus on maximizing the throat velocity where a turbine can be located. Tested variables include funnel shape, lengths of both inlet and outlet funnels, and curvature of the inlet rim.

40|$|The sizing of {{emergency}} relief vents to mitigate runaway chemical reactions in batch or semi-batch reactors {{is important for}} the protection of the workers and the process unit. This has been a preoccupation in industry for many years and different design methods have been proposed depending on the type of system (gassy, vapor, or hybrid) and the flow characteristics of the reacting fluid. Industry needs simple, reliable and accurate sizing methods so as not to undersize nor oversize the vent area. In the present work, runaway reactions in two chemical systems were studied experimentally with various apparatuses in volumes from 30 Âµl up to 10 liters (DSC, PHI-TEC I, ARSST, VSP 2, Vent Sizing Simulator, 800 ml reactor, and the standard 10 liter vessel used for the United Nations test for sizing rupture disks for vessels containing self-reactive materials). The two systems were the decomposition of a solution of DiButylPeroxide in butyrate and the esterification of acetic anhydride by methanol. The first system is virtually purely gassy, meaning that the overpressure in the vessel during runaway is produced by incondensable gas while the second is purely vapor, meaning that the overpressure is due to the vapor pressure of the reaction mass as the temperature rises. The data recorded were used to determine the A/V ratio for the emergency <b>relief</b> <b>vent</b> or rupture disk for a 1 m 3 vessel. Two categories of sizing methods were used. The similarity method was employed, whereby the A/V ratio is directly determined experimentally for a given set of conditions, with three reactors : 0. 11, 0, 8 and 10 liters. The calculation method was based on the DIERS approach and was employed using the data from bench-scale pseudo-adiabatic calorimeters. The results show that the similarity method predicts vent sizes which are much smaller than those predicted by the DIERS approach...|$|E

5000|$|On March 3, 1974, {{an almost}} {{identical}} cargo door blow-out caused Turkish Airlines Flight 981 {{to crash into}} a forest {{near the town of}} Ermenonville, France shortly after leaving Paris. [...] All 346 people were killed; {{it was one of the}} deadliest air crashes of all time. Circumstances of this crash were very similar to the previous accident. The cargo door had not been fully locked, though it appeared so to both cockpit crew and ground personnel. The Turkish aircraft had a different seating configuration that exacerbated the effects of decompression, which caused the aircraft's floor to collapse into the cargo bay. Control cables running through the floor beams were severed when the floor collapsed and rendered the aircraft uncontrollable. Crash investigators found that the DC-10's <b>relief</b> <b>vents</b> were not large enough to equalize the pressure between the passenger and cargo compartments during explosive decompression. Following this crash, a special subcommittee of the House of Representatives investigated the cargo door issue and the FAA's certification of the original design. An airworthiness directive was issued, and all DC-10s underwent mandatory door modifications. The DC-10 experienced no more major incidents related to its cargo door after FAA-approved changes were made.|$|R

40|$|Measurements of {{the rates}} of {{pressure}} rise and a photo&raphic study of the flames emerging from the maximum experimental safe gap apparatus have shown that although <b>relief</b> <b>venting</b> may reduce the maximum explosion pressure it may increase the rate of pressure rise within the time interval when the reaction zone and following hot combustion products are flowing through the flange gap. In some explosions {{the presence of the}} relief caused acoustic standing waves, and the resultant movement of gas interfered with the combustion wave. Schlieren and direct photographs of the transmitterr explosions have shown that, in vented explosions, transmission through a flange gap need not necessarily occur nearest to the igniting source, and in some cases ignition took place in two locations simultaneously. With ethylene/air and propane/air mixtures the transmissions occurred during the initial stages of the explosion. With hydrogen/ air mixtures the transmission of the explosion occurred when the explosion pressure reached 25 per cent of the peak value. As the location of the explosion transmission through a flange gap is largely unpredictable, the timing of the newly formed flame front outside the vessel with ionisation detectors opposite the igniting source may be inaccurate.

40|$|This paper aims at {{contributing}} to the efficient design of explosion protection systems against confined explosions. The issue addressed concerns the quantitative estimation of the protective effect of explosion <b>relief</b> <b>vents</b> {{in the case of}} confined explosions inside tunnels. A series of virtual experiments performed by computer simulation, revealed how the number of vents, their diameter, as well as the angle between the vents and the tunnel, influences the blast wave attenuation. The computational study was performed considering a complicated large-scale tunnel configuration with branches on its half portion. The purpose was the calculation of the attenuation effect due to the presence of vents by comparing the total explosion-specific impulse developing at antidiametric positions inside the tunnel. Simulations were carried out via a three-dimensional numerical model built in the computational fluid dynamics code CFX 5. 7. 1, which has been validated in previous papers against experimental overpressure histories data demonstrating reasonable performance. Computer results showed that the use of branch vents provides an effective method for shock wave attenuation following an explosion, whereas their statistical elaboration revealed that the attenuation is mainly affected by the number of vents and their diameter. In contrast, the angle between the side vents and the main tunnel appeared to slightly affect the pressure wave weakening. Eventually, the quantitative influence of the above parameters was effectively illustrated in functional diagrams, so that the total attenuation effect may be promptly estimated, if the design variables are known. In addition, two statistical models with reasonable fitting to the calculated data are proposed, which express the attenuation effect as a dependent variable of the design variables including their interactions.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to evaluate a method of maintaining stability of an air cushion vehicle and also to evaluate several concepts to brake and steer an ACLS-equipped vehicle. The investigation used a modified airboat equipped with an air cushion landing system. The pressure relief door stability concept was characterized by the ACLS pressure time histories. The pressure <b>relief</b> doors <b>vented</b> excess cavity and lobe pressures and consistently maintained vehicle heave and pitch stability. Braking concepts were characterized by the average deceleration of the vehicle. Reduced lobe flow and cavity venting braking concepts were evaluated in this program. The cavity venting concept demonstrated the best performance, producing decelerations on the test vehicle on the same order as moderate braking with conventional wheel brakes. Steering concepts were evaluated by recording the path taken while attempting to follow a prescribed maneuver. The steering concepts evaluated included using rudders only, using differential lobe flow, and using rudders combined with a lightly loaded, nonsteering center wheel.

40|$|The {{biodiesel}} {{production process}} involves Class I flammables, corrosive chemicals, process tanks, and waste or extraneous by-product collection tanks. The regulatory requirement is that tanks {{be compatible with}} the product stored, but not specifically that they be stainless construction. Stainless is the most logical for the blending tank and since biodiesel has corrosive characteristics somewhat greater than diesel {{it is not a}} bad choice for storage and the waste product collection tank. The Class I flammable is methanol and the tank storing methanol must be built to UL 142 standards for a Class I flammable. A common practice currently used in biodiesel production is to use plastic IBC or totes for the methanol, but that is illegal as these containers are not listed for Class I liquids and do not have the proper safety mechanisms. Last fall a bio plant burned to the ground in Bakersfield, CA from a fire that originated from a static spark while transferring methanol into the tote. Comm 10 does not regulate process tanks, but since the process reaction involves heat, chemicals and a flammable liquid, the process tank needs to have adequate pressure <b>relief</b> and <b>venting</b> safeguards.

50|$|BLEVEs can {{be caused}} by an {{external}} fire near the storage vessel causing heating of the contents and pressure build-up. While tanks are often designed to withstand great pressure, constant heating can cause the metal to weaken and eventually fail. If the tank is being heated in an area where there is no liquid, it may rupture faster without the liquid to absorb the heat. Gas containers are usually equipped with <b>relief</b> valves that <b>vent</b> off excess pressure, but the tank can still fail if the pressure is not released quickly enough. Relief valves are sized to release pressure fast enough to prevent the pressure from increasing beyond the strength of the vessel, but not so fast as to be the cause of an explosion. An appropriately sized relief valve will allow the liquid inside to boil slowly, maintaining a constant pressure in the vessel until all the liquid has boiled and the vessel empties.|$|R
40|$|Accidental gas explosions are a {{recognised}} hazard {{in process}} industries {{but they are}} also common in residential buildings. Whilst process plants have specifically designed <b>vent</b> <b>reliefs</b> to limit the enclosure damage, in homes a similar effect is achieved due to the presence of doors and windows whose failure often protects the building. There are empirically based correlations for predicting overpressure and for vent sizing, however these are limited in application to simple enclosures. In practice, enclosures have interconnected spaces which would potentially increase the flame acceleration considerably. In this paper we present the results of full scale natural gas layer tests in a twin chamber, which consisted of two 22 m 3 enclosures connected by an open doorway. Layered natural gas/air mixtures of 8, 10 and 12 % by volume, were ignited at the rear of one of the chambers. Explosion relief was provided by vent openings of 2. 48, 1. 49 or 0. 74 m 2 on the far walls of both chambers. With tests with equal large vents on each of the chambers, the dominant influence was the external explosion. The maximum overpressure was produced by tests involving a 12 % natural gas concentration. The use of a smaller vent in the adjoining enclosure had a significant effect on the maximum overpressure and the mechanism of the explosion development. However, altering the size from 1. 49 m 2 to 0. 74 m 2 had little overall effect. This was largely due to the greater generation of turbulence and the venting process which predominantly occurred via the doorway and through the ignition-chamber vent opening. The use of a smaller vent in the ignition enclosure also altered {{the manner in which the}} explosion developed. A venting driven â€˜jettingâ€™ expanding flame, propagated into the adjoining enclosure and towards the far vent opening, generating the dominant pressure peak in these type of tests...|$|R
