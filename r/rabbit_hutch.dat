2500|$|Ernest Norman {{claimed to}} have been a child prodigy, having read all his father's (a {{physician}} from Scandinavia) books eagerly, self-educating himself alongside his formal schooling. He also claimed that as a child, he performed to family, neighbors and teachers unexpected feats such as moving a heavy <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutch</b> using Archimedean principles and small logs, building radios and winning arguments with parents and teachers at an early age. According to Unarius, Ernest Norman was a scientist, and [...] an aeronautical engineer from whom the idea of the television tube was stolen.|$|E

60|$|Seven weeks later, the pervadence {{throughout}} the dormitory of an atmospheric effect more curious than pleasing {{led to the}} discovery that he had converted his box into a <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutch.</b> Confronted with eleven kicking witnesses, and reminded of his former promises, he explained that rabbits were not mice, and seemed to consider that a new and vexatious regulation had been sprung upon him. The rabbits were confiscated. What was their ultimate fate, we never knew with certainty, but three days later we were given rabbit-pie for dinner. To comfort him I endeavoured to assure him that these could not be his rabbits. He, however, convinced that they were, cried steadily into his plate {{all the time that}} he was eating them, and afterwards, in the playground, had a stand-up fight with a fourth form boy who had requested a second helping.|$|E

50|$|Whilst {{praised for}} his passion and {{willingness}} to accept 'paper plans' and 'Utopian projects', he could sometimes be uncompromising and frank. On {{a visit to a}} newly built block of flats in Portsmouth, he is known to have exclaimed to those present, many of whom were ex-students of his:'You have built these chicken-coops, these <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutches!</b> You?'.|$|R
6000|$|And to him, {{the society}} of the Goyle was a new charm. He had been brought up to the {{technicalities}} and the business relations of art, and had a cultivated taste; but to be with a thoughtful, highly educated lady, able to enter into its higher and deeper associations, was an unspeakable delight and improvement to him. Vera was fairly satisfied as long as he sketched her in various attitudes, and held her hand while he talked; though she did grudge having so much time spent on [...] "taste, Shakespeare and the musical glasses." [...] Paula had various ecclesiastical interests in common with him, and began to expand and enter more into realities, while Thekla had in him a dear delightful delicious brother, who petted her, bantered her, mended her <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutch,</b> caught her hedgehog, taught her to guide her bicycle, drew picture games for her, and taught her to sketch.|$|E

I don't take no... from women.|$|R
50|$|Through {{indifference}} or ignorance, many puppies {{were left}} unsocialized or exposed in existing chicken coops or <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutches.</b> In addition, veterinary care for these puppies was often overlooked {{because of an}} inability to pay. As a result, {{organizations such as the}} Humane Society of the United States began to investigate breeding kennels, leading to the passage of the Animal Welfare Act of August 24, 1966.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} included 22 private {{rooms and}} lounges. The London food reviewer and historian Lt.-Col. Nathaniel Newnham-Davis stated [...] "...the Anglais' {{was a great}} supping place, the little <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutches</b> of the entresol being the scene {{of some of the}} wildest and most interesting parties given by the great men of the Second Empire."

5000|$|In March 2017, it was {{announced}} that it would be converted into 254 flats, some as small as 16 square metres. The size of the smallest flats in the building was criticised by local councillors with one saying [...] "These <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutch</b> homes would turn Barnet House into a human filing cabinet".|$|E
50|$|Francis P. Keilman House is a {{historic}} home located at St. John, Lake County, Indiana. It was built about 1857, and is a two-story, side hall plan balloon frame dwelling with Italianate style design elements. It has a front gable roof and a rear addition built about 1900. Also on the property are the contributing wood frame stable (c. 1890) with a garage addition (c. 1940) and a wood frame <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutch</b> (c. 1940).|$|E
5000|$|According to Gerry Bron, Stanshall {{had several}} weeks to write songs {{for the new}} {{professional}} Bonzo Dog Band. But when band members arrived at his studio, they found he had not written anything, but had instead built a variety of <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutches.</b> Much of the band's original repertoire was based on re-workings of songs from the 1920s and '30s, found on 78s, bought for pence from local fleamarkets. Bron mentioned in a TV documentary, that he found Vivian making <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutches</b> in a hall in Acton, May 1968, West London. The actual location is Askew Road Church hall {{at the start of}} Bassein Park Road in Shepherds Bush. This rabbit-related activity would suggest that these were rehearsals for the Doughnut in Grannys' Greenhouse album. During recordings for this at Morgan Studios, Vivian, wearing just a rabbit's head and underpants, interviewed members of the public in Willesden High Road. On the album track [...] "We Are Normal", an elderly gentleman can be heard saying, [...] "He's got a head on like a rabbit." ...|$|R
50|$|Sometimes isolated, {{this home}} is {{structured}} {{to meet the}} needs of exploring the farm. It may consist of buildings arranged around a central space, patio, made up by housing, livestock, pigsty, chicken coop, <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutches</b> and stores where farm implements and crops are kept and where there is the mill, the winery and the distillery. The farmyard is the farming space, where are the oxen cars, the cereals cleaner, the seed drill and the agricultural implements.|$|R
5000|$|Cage homes, {{described}} as [...] "wire mesh cages resembling <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutches</b> crammed into a dilapidated apartment", {{were built in}} Hong Kong in the 1950s for single working men from Mainland China. As of 2012, the number of impoverished residents in Hong Kong was estimated at 1.19 million, and cage homes, along with substandard housing such as cubicle apartments, were still serving a portion of this sector's housing needs. The combination of high rents and income inequality has been given as one reason that cage homes persist.|$|R
50|$|It {{is common}} in North America and Europe. It {{may be found in}} {{proximity}} to human structures, such as basements or sheds. A nickname for this arachnid is the <b>Rabbit</b> <b>Hutch</b> Spider, since rabbit hutches often make a suitable habitat. The Steatoda bipunctata is similar in shape to the Black Widow spider of the genus Latrodectus and can thus be mistaken for it, although its bite is significantly less dangerous to humans. For this reason, species of the genus Steatoda are commonly called 'False Widows'.|$|E

50|$|As {{the event}} draws close, Wallace finds {{themselves}} {{running out of}} space to cage the rabbits. He is inspired to create the Mind Manipulation-O-Matic machine to brainwash the rabbits and remove their appetite for vegetables. On his first attempt, a rabbit is stuck to Wallace's head as he uses the machine's headpieces, and Gromit destroys the machine to protect Wallace. The machine appears to have worked as the rabbit shows no interest in vegetables though appears to have gained some intelligence. They name the <b>rabbit</b> <b>Hutch</b> while Wallace begins rebuilding the device.|$|E
5000|$|Rabbits {{can live}} {{outdoors}} in properly constructed, sheltered hutches, which provide {{protection from the}} elements in winter and keep rabbits cool in summer heat. To protect from predators, <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutches</b> are usually situated in a fenced yard, shed, barn, or other enclosed structure, which may also contain a larger pen for exercise. [...] Rabbits {{in such an environment}} can alternatively be allowed to roam the secured area freely, and simply be provided with an adapted doghouse for shelter. A more elaborate setup is an artificial warren.|$|R
25|$|For a while {{maintenance}} may {{not have}} been routine, since in 1953 a family complete with dogs and <b>rabbits</b> in <b>hutches</b> was living {{in one corner of the}} cemetery, burning their trash on graves.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{buildings}} in the farm complex are a brick butchering structure, a brick chicken coop, wooden sheds and <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutches,</b> a brick outhouse with a kitchen and watch house, a wooden grain barn, and the brick farmhouse. This house is a symmetrical one-and-one-half-story structure that features a single central recessed doorway with two windows on each side. Inside, the residents walk along walnut woodworking and are greeted by stencilling on the walls. Like the rest of {{the buildings}} on the homestead, the house has changed very little in the past century and a half, remaining in a condition almost identical to that of its youth.|$|R
50|$|The abdomens of {{both sexes}} are bulbous and {{brownish}} in coloration, typically with a broken pale line down the center and another pale line across the anterior portion of the abdomen. The apodemes (places of muscle attachment) on the dorsal side of the abdomen look like pairs of dark dimples and presumably give the spider its Latin name bi- (two) and -punctata (spots). The underside of the abdomen of the <b>Rabbit</b> <b>Hutch</b> Spider reveals a most interesting pattern resembling the infinity sign. The female abdomen is light brown and often shiny compared to the males.|$|E
50|$|Now unemployed, Kaiser {{offered his}} {{services}} as a chemicals expert to the recently established KgU, with which he was politically in sympathy. From early 1951 the KgU placed a former multi-occupancy <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutch</b> at his disposal, {{in the garden of}} their premises in Berlin's Nikolassee district. Later his work as the KgU's chemistry expert transferred to three basement rooms in an apartment which the movement rented at Kurfürstendamm No.106, in the city's central Halensee district. Kaiser continued through this time to receive unemployment benefit: he was not an employee of the KgU. He did, however, receive a small honorarium from them, initially of 50 Marks per month, and which in May 1951 was doubled to 100 Marks.|$|E
50|$|Ted and Dougal then {{resort to}} desperate {{measures}} {{to hide the}} army of rabbits, such as hiding them at the local greyhound track, giving them to their accident-prone friend Father Larry Duff (who's now bought some Rottweiler dogs) and giving them to Tom the psychopath, all to no avail. The Bishop soon arrives, when Mrs. Doyle ruins his car engine and Ted talks to him and shows him the security arrangements for Jack (which involve razor wire around his bed and a straitjacket suit). In the conversation, the Bishop notices a <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutch</b> on the floor, rabbit poo on the carpet (which Ted says is caviar) and Mrs. Doyle walking in with some lettuce, all of which prompt the Bishop to go to bed.|$|E

5000|$|All rabbits {{must have}} an {{adequate}} exercise area, whether it is an outside run or an enclosed area in the house. Softwood shavings {{should not be used}} for the floor of the hutch or cage as they can cause respiratory problems. Fine sawdust can cause eye irritations so this should be avoided. Bedding material should be provided especially in cold and wet weather for the outdoor rabbit. A recommended practise is to place the straw on top of a layer of the hardwood shavings in the sleeping compartment, in order to ensure warmth and insulation for an outdoor Belgian Hare. The rabbit home should be cleaned out weekly and any old food removed. If it is necessary to wash the home then only use a cleaner specifically designed for cleaning <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{program was}} officially created on 1 July 1951. Spitzer, an avid {{mountain}} climber, proposed the name [...] "Project Matterhorn" [...] {{because he felt}} [...] "the work at hand seemed difficult, like the ascent of a mountain." [...] Two sections were initially set up, S Section working on the stellerator under Spitzer, and B Section working on bomb design under Wheeler. The team was set up at Princeton's new Forrestal Campus, an 825 acre plot of land the University purchased from the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research when they relocated to Manhatten at what would become Rockefeller University. The plot already had sixteen laboratory buildings and was located about [...] from the main Princeton campus. Spitzer set up the top-secret S Section in a former <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Two weeks {{pass and}} as Nubbin explores the area, he {{encounters}} Old Grouch, Weecha's father, who attacks him. Mala intervenes and fights her mate, who later leaves the area. By the time summer arrives, Nubbin and Weecha are firm friends and have several adventures together. One day while chasing a rabbit, Nubbin {{is threatened by}} a bobcat, but Mala lures the bobcat {{away from him and}} gives her life to save the dog. Now alone, Weecha and Nubbin search for food and when they come upon Jeff fishing, steal his fish. Jeff realizes that Nubbin is Lulubelle's missing pup and captures both of them, putting Weecha in an unused <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutch.</b> Jeff is surprised when Nubbin refuses to abandon his friend, and later, Weecha manipulates the latch on his cage and escapes for a nighttime romp with Nubbin, during which he wrecks Jeff's workshop. When an iron rod falls against a grinding wheel Weecha has accidentally started, sparks fly and start a fire, but Weecha races back to his cage. After Jeff is awakened by his hounds' barking and extinguishes the fire, he discovers Weecha and Nubbin sleeping innocently.|$|E
5000|$|Three weeks later, Jeff {{begins to}} train Nubbin {{and his other}} young hounds to locate {{raccoons}} by following their scent. At first Jeff uses a raccoon skin as bait, but when he switches to Weecha, Nubbin refuses to work and fights off all the other dogs. Several months later, Jeff is invited on a coon hunt in a neighboring valley and leaves with his favorite hound, Rounder. Nubbin and Weecha are now full grown although Weecha is still a captive in the <b>rabbit</b> <b>hutch.</b> However, the hound helps his friend to escape and Weecha, having learned how to manipulate the latches on the hutches, releases all of Jeff's rabbits. Unfortunately, he steps on the trigger of a shotgun and the shot alerts the hounds, who break out of their enclosure to chase the rabbits. Weecha hides inside a barrel, which the dogs roll over just as Jeff returns with Rounder. Weecha manages to escape but is pursued by Rounder. While fighting in a pond, Weecha grabs Rounder by the neck and almost drowns him, then escapes. By autumn, Weecha has completely reverted to the wild and survives by stealing duck eggs, as well as nuts and berries from pine squirrel nests.|$|E
25|$|Gartenskulptor (Garden Sculpture), for instance, {{had started}} out as a copy of the {{multiple}} P.O.TH.A.A.VFB, a self-portrait bust made of chocolate and birdseed standing on a bird-table, exposed to the elements. Referred to by Roth as a 'dis- and re-assembly object', each new incarnation gradually acquired working drawings, paintings, sculpted rabbits and collages placed on trellises in collector's gardens. It even acquired a real rabbit and the <b>rabbit's</b> <b>hutch</b> for a number of years. The last time it was installed in a garden was in 1989. When it was exhibited indoors in Switzerland, 1992, Gartenskulptor took up an entire room. By 1995 it was 20m long and included all sorts of objects including a fire ladder and television screens. By 2000, in Mönchengladbach, it was 40 metres long, having acquired elements from each of the installations' incarnations, including pebbly earth excavated by the architects Herzog and de Meuron for the facade of the Schaulager, for instance. The rabbit was no longer present.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Hazel and Pipkin, the {{smallest}} {{member of the}} group, scout the nearby Nuthanger Farm, where they find two pairs of <b>hutch</b> <b>rabbits.</b> Despite their uncertainty about living wild, the <b>hutch</b> <b>rabbits</b> are willing to come to Watership. Hazel leads a raid on the farm the next day, during which he rescues both does but {{only one of the}} bucks. When the emissary returns soon after, Hazel and his rabbits learn that Efrafa is a police state led by the despotic General Woundwort.
