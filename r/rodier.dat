500|$|Reflecting his own {{fascination for}} modern art, Hergé {{began work on}} Tintin and Alph-Art in 1978, however it was left {{unfinished}} {{at the time of}} his death in March 1983. At this point it consisted of around 150 pages of pencil-drawn notes, outlines and sketches– not yet rendered in Hergé's trademark ligne claire drawing style– with no ending having been devised for the story. Hergé's colleague Bob de Moor [...] offered to complete the story for publication, and while Hergé's widow Fanny Vlamyck initially agreed, she changed her decision, citing the fact that her late husband had not wanted anyone else to continue The Adventures of Tintin. A selection of the original notes were collected together and published in book form by Casterman in 1986. Since that point, a number of other cartoonists, such as Yves <b>Rodier,</b> have produced their own finished, unauthorized versions of the story. Critical reception of the work has been mixed; some commentators on The Adventures of Tintin have believed that Tintin and Alph-Art would have been an improvement over much of Hergé's later work, while others have characterised this as wishful thinking.|$|E
