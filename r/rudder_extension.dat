2500|$|The T.III was a {{cantilever}} {{low wing}} monoplane with thick section, straight tapered, square tipped wings. Angular overhung ailerons were used. [...] Its fuselage was flat topped and sided and deep from tail to nose. The three crew sat in tandem, separate, open oval cockpits, with the forward two close together over the wing and fitted with dual control. The third cockpit was spaced further away behind the trailing edge and fitted with two machine guns, {{one on a}} conventional mounting firing upwards and the other firing downwards through the fuselage underside. [...] The rear cockpit also held the two release levers for 50kg (110lb) and for 100kg (220lb) bombs. [...] The braced tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and carried horn-balanced elevators. In plan the tail was straight tapered and square tipped, with a large cut-out for rudder movement. There were several variations of the vertical tail though in all the rudder was straight edged and balanced. Some had no fin, with the rudder finishing at the keel and with a nick above the fuselage, another similar but with a <b>rudder</b> <b>extension</b> to below the keel and another still with a very short fin and small dorsal fillet but no fin extension.|$|E
50|$|Waco {{introduced}} the luxury N series biplane in 1937. It {{was based on}} the Waco C series five-seat Custom Cabin Waco with that model's curved pointed wings, but with an unusual fixed tricycle undercarriage and a modified tail with a lower <b>rudder</b> <b>extension</b> to give increased side area. The Waco N was fitted with flaps on all four wings to improve the aircraft's landing characteristics.|$|E
5000|$|Despite blustery {{conditions}} {{throughout the}} week of the competition, Raynham flew the Handasyde several times. After some practising over the weekend, he made two competitive flights on Monday 16 October, the better of which lasted 11 min 23 s. [...] Learning from the approach taken by Fokker, who had more gliding experience, he greatly improved his time the following day to 113 min and looked set for the Daily Mail prize. There was little flying on Thursday because of the winds, and the Handasyde team took the opportunity to fit a <b>rudder</b> <b>extension</b> and increase the aileron deflection. However, on the afternoon of the last day, Saturday 21 October, the French pilot Maneyrol stayed up for 201 min in his tandem-winged Peyret glider. [...] Raynham made another flight but this was brief and he had to be content with the £50 Ogilvie prize for the best British flight on the first day and another £10 prize, from the Seaford Chamber of Commerce, for the longest straight line flight. He was later awarded the Britannia Trophy for the most meretricious British flight of the year.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rudder,</b> tiller and <b>extension</b> {{are made}} from wood. The {{original}} design has a lifting rudder which is held in the down position by a piece of shockcord.|$|R
50|$|The Minibat is {{constructed}} predominately from foam and fiberglass and features a monowheel landing gear. The engine is {{mounted in the}} rear fuselage in pusher configuration, with the propeller mounted unconventionally between the fuselage and the <b>rudder.</b> Wingtip <b>extensions</b> are available which increase the wingspan to 32.7 ft and raise the aircraft's glide ratio from 23:1 with the standard 25 ft wings to 30:1.|$|R
5000|$|XYB-180 UAV is a jet-powered UAV {{developed}} by XYAST. Externally, XYB-180 resembles a miniature jet fighter with conventional layout. The inlet is located above the fuselage {{at the root}} of the single vertical <b>rudder,</b> and leading-edge <b>extension</b> is also incorporated. XYB-180 can be either vehicle launched or rocket assisted launched. [...] Specification: ...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} {{free-stream}} wind tunnel experiments on semi-balanced skeg rudders are presented. The tests on these <b>rudders</b> are an <b>extension</b> to earlier tests on a parent skeg rudder, {{which were the}} subject of a separate report, and complete a series of tests on three skeg rudders having taper ratios of 0. 59, 0. 80 and 1. 00. The experiments establish {{a better understanding of the}} working and performance of semi-balanced skeg rudders, and provide design data. Results are presented as lift and drag coefficients and centre of pressure for the rudder plus skeg combinations, for the rudders alone and skegs alone; complete ranges of rudder angles of attack were tested for selected positive and negative angles of attack on the skegs. Supplementary tests were carried out to determine the influences of Reynolds No., the size of the gap between rudder and tunnel floor, the transition strip and the effect of sealing the gap between rudder and skeg. In order to provide bases for comparison, the all-movable cases were simulated for each rudder by sealing the gap between rudder and skeg and varying the angles of attack on rudder and skeg simultaneously. The results for the all-movable cases compare very satisfactorily with existing published data. The results for the skeg rudders show that with increasing angle of attack, discontinuities occur in the growth of lift together with a large movement of centre of pressure. Sealing the gap between rudder and skeg was seen to lead to a significant improvement in the lift developed at higher rudder angles of attack. The results for the three skeg rudders are compared, and the flow breakdown accounting for the discontinuities in the skeg rudder characteristics is discussed...|$|R
