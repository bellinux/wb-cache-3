2500|$|Nance {{honors the}} memory of U.S. Army officer Humayun Khan in the book's dedication. The Plot to Hack America begins with a {{foreword}} by Spencer Ackerman. The book details Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, which the book characterizes as [...] "Watergate 2.0". Nance describes how, in March 2016, Democratic National Committee (DNC) servers were hacked by culprits seeking opposition research on Donald Trump. Nance recounts learning of a hacker Guccifer 2.0, and realizing they were a copycat of a Romanian known as Guccifer who had already been extradited to the United States. Guccifer 2.0 {{was found to be}} a lone individual who would release hacked DNC materials. Nance gives context including Trump's motivations to run for President after being made fun of at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, his criticism of Barack Obama, and his entry into the 2016 <b>race</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House.|$|E

The effort resulted in a new media startup at ABC called ABC News InterActive, which created multimedia award-winning products from ABC News.|$|R
40|$|In prior work, I {{proposed}} a prisoner's dilemma theory <b>for</b> <b>the</b> partisan pattern that political ticket splitting {{has taken in}} the United States: where Republicans, since 1932, have done consistently better in <b>races</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House than in contests <b>for</b> Congressional seats. <b>The</b> theory relies on the key assumption that Democratic legislative representatives {{are more willing to}} engage in local benefit-seeking. By examining the personal staffing decisions made by members of the House this paper provides some empirical support for such an assumption. Relative to their Republican counterparts, Democratic legislators both hire more personal staff and allocate a higher percentage of the staff hired to district rather than Washington offices.

40|$|Objectives: This report {{presents}} complete period life tables by Hispanic origin, <b>race</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> non-Hispanic <b>white</b> and non-Hispanic black populations, and sex <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United States {{based on}} age-specific death rates in 2006. Methods: The {{methods used to}} estimate the probability of death for ages 0 - 80 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Hispanic population and 0 - 65 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> non-Hispanic <b>white</b> and non-Hispanic black populations {{are the same as}} those used in annual U. S. life tables since 1997, with an important modification. Age-specific death rates are first corrected for racial and ethnic misclassification on U. S. death certificates. To address the effects of age misstatement at the oldest ages, the methodology used to estimate mortality for ages 66 and over <b>for</b> <b>the</b> non-Hispanic <b>white</b> and non-Hispanic black populations is the same as that used to estimate the annual life tables since 2005. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> Hispanic population, the probability of death for ages over 80 is estimated as a function of non-Hispanic <b>white</b> mortality with <b>the</b> use of the Brass relational logit model. Results: Life expectancy at birth <b>for</b> <b>the</b> total population in 2006 was 77. 7 years; 80. 6 years <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Hispanic population, 78. 1 years <b>for</b> <b>the</b> non-Hispanic <b>white</b> population, and 72. 9 years <b>for</b> <b>the</b> non-Hispanic black population. The Hispanic population has a life expectancy advantage at birth of 2. 5 years over <b>the</b> non-Hispanic <b>white</b> population and 7. 7 years over the non-Hispanic black population. Although seemingly paradoxical, these results are consistent with the findings of numerous studies which show a Hispanic mortality advantage despite this population's lower socioeconomic status. Nonetheless, the procedures used in this report to correct for racial and ethnic misclassification and age misstatement are not error free and therefore some of the observed advantage may still be a function of data artifact. This report does not address other factors that may explain the Hispanic mortality advantage. " - p. 1 by Elizabeth Arias. "October 2010.
