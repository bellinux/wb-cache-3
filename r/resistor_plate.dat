5000|$|The pre-amp is {{notorious for}} ground loop hum. Re-wiring and {{separating}} the audio ground shield {{from the power}} return ground lead in the MOLEX connector is one solution. The pre-amp can sound quicker if the circuit is rebuilt with Hi-End Audio Grade coupling caps. Diodes were later used to by-pass the 22ohm screen resistors. In {{the event of a}} tube short failure or simply a transient overload condition the diode will conduct once the current in the 22ohm screen resistor reaches 30mA and beyond, preventing further burning of the PCBA. The diode will clamp the current in the 22ohm screen resistor to 30mA, so preferably the <b>plate</b> <b>resistor</b> will blow...since the <b>plate</b> <b>resistor</b> is acting as a [...] "fuse".|$|R

50|$|The central {{processing}} unit contains many toxic materials. It contains lead and chromium in the metal <b>plates.</b> <b>Resistors,</b> semi-conductors, infrared detectors, stabilizers, cables, and wires contain cadmium. The circuit boards in a computer contain mercury, and chromium. When these types of materials, and chemicals are disposed improperly will become hazardous for the environment.|$|R
50|$|Cathode bias is {{also used}} to achieve phase inversion. In a more simple circuit, which has less than unity gain, the cathode and <b>plate</b> <b>resistors</b> are made equal. In {{accordance}} with Kirchhoff's law, the current through both resistors will be equal, thus the voltage across them will also be equal. As the plate becomes more negative, the cathode will become more positive, and conversely. The resulting signals are capacitively coupled to any succeeding stages, providing a pair of signals 180° out of phase.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} an apparent paradox concerning a moving plate capacitor driven by thermal noise from a <b>resistor.</b> The <b>plates</b> are attracted together, but a demon restores the plates of the capacitor {{to their original}} position when the voltage across the capacitor is small-hence only small forces are present for the demon to work against. The demon has to work harder than this to avoid the situation of perpetual motion, but the open question is how? This is unsolved, however we explore {{the concept of a}} moving plate capacitor by examining the case where it is still excited by thermal noise, but where the restoring force on the capacitor plates is provided by a simple spring rather than some unknown demon. We display simulation results with interesting behavior, particularly where the capacitor plates collide with each other. (c) 2001 American Institute of Physics. B. R. Davis, D. Abbott, and J. M. R.

5000|$|<b>Plate</b> <b>resistors</b> {{should be}} kept off the circuit board by approx 1/2" [...] min to prevent PCBA burning. The diode is taking on the current surge to protect the 22ohm resistor, however the peak over current in the diode can only sustain for a short duration. The 6550A version usually idles with roughly 700V DC on the plate and 350V DC on the Screens...during full clean sine wave 300W power output, {{operating}} voltages will dip to roughly 650V DC on the Plate and 325V on the Screens.

50|$|Typically a 12AX7 triode is {{configured}} with a high-value <b>plate</b> <b>resistor,</b> 100k ohms in most guitar amps and 220k ohms {{or more in}} high-fidelity equipment. Grid bias is {{most often}} provided by a cathode resistor. If the cathode resistor is unbypassed, negative feedback is introduced and each half of a 12AX7 provides a typical voltage gain of about 30; the amplification factor is basically twice the maximum stage gain, as the plate impedance must be matched. Thus half the voltage is across the tube at rest, half across the load resistor. The cathode resistor can be bypassed to reduce or eliminate AC negative feedback and thereby increase gain; maximum gain is about 60 times.|$|R
50|$|Mathematically, {{the gain}} of the phase {{inverting}} stage {{is given by}} {{the product of the}} amplification factor and the load impedance divided by the sum of the plate resistance and the load impedance. The gain of the in phase stage is given by the product of (one plus the amplification factor) and the load impedance divided by the sum of the plate resistance and the load impedance. In order for the gains to be equal, it is customary to use different values of plate resistance. For example, in such a phase inverting circuit using a 12AX7, the inverting stage would have a <b>plate</b> <b>resistor</b> of 100KΩ while the in phase stage would use a resistor of 82 KΩ. Mathematically, it works out pretty close.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{foremost}} design considerations in microelectronics miniaturization {{is the use of}} embedded passives which provide practical solution. In a typical circuit, over 80 percent of the electronic components are passives such as resistors, inductors, and capacitors that could take up to almost 50 percent of the entire printed circuit board area. By integrating passive components within the substrate instead of being on the surface, embedded passives reduce the system real estate, eliminate the need for discrete and assembly, enhance electrical performance and reliability, and potentially reduce the overall cost. Moreover, it is lead free. Even with these advantages, embedded passive technology is at a relatively immature stage and more characterization and optimization are needed for practical applications leading to its commercialization. This paper presents an entire process from design and fabrication to electrical characterization and reliability test of embedded passives on multilayered microvia organic substrate. Two test vehicles focusing on resistors and capacitors have been designed and fabricated. Embedded capacitors in this study are made with polymer/ceramic nanocomposite (BaTiO 3) material to take advantage of low processing temperature of polymers and relatively high dielectric constant of ceramics and the values of these capacitors range from 50 pF to 1. 5 nF with capacitance per area of approximately 1. 5 nF/cm(2). Limited high frequency measurement of these capacitors was performed. Furthermore, reliability assessments of thermal shock and temperature humidity tests based on JEDEC standards were carried out. Resistors used in this work have been of three types: 1) carbon ink based polymer thick film (PTF), 2) resistor foils with known sheet resistivities which are laminated to printed wiring board (PWB) during a sequential build-up (SBU) process and 3) thin-film <b>resistor</b> <b>plating</b> by electroless method. Realization of embedded resistors on conventional board-level high-loss epoxy (similar to 0. 015 at 1 GHz) and proposed low-loss BCB dielectric (similar to 0. 0008 at > 40 GHz) has been explored in this study. Ni-P and Ni-W-P alloys were plated using conventional electroless plating, and NiCr and NiCrAlSi foils were used for the foil transfer process. For the first time, Benzocyclobutene (BCB) has been proposed as a board level dielectric for advanced System-on-Package (SOP) module primarily due to its attractive low-loss (for RF application) and thin film (for high density wiring) properties. Although embedded passives are more reliable by eliminating solder joint interconnects, they also introduce other concerns such as cracks, delamination and component instability. More layers may be needed to accommodate the embedded passives, and various materials within the substrate may cause significant thermo -mechanical stress due to coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch. In this work, numerical models of embedded capacitors have been developed to qualitatively examine the effects of process conditions and electrical performance due to thermo-mechanical deformations. Also, a prototype working product with the board level design including features of embedded resistors and capacitors are underway. Preliminary results of these are presented...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Due {{to a lack}} {{of grain}} boundaries, an {{amorphous}} metal thin film (AMTF) possesses advantageous mechanical properties and enhanced chemical stability that is potentially useful for thermal inkjet (TIJ) printing applications. The use of an AMTF as a TIJ <b>resistor</b> or cavitation <b>plate</b> could lead to a thinner TIJ cavitation plate and improved thermal performance. However, if an AMTF is to be used as in a TIJ application, it must remain amorphous during TIJ operation. Six new Ta-based AMTFs are investigated and are found to remain amorphous up to temperatures in excess of 600 °C. AMTFs prepared using a sputter target composition of Ta₃₀W₃₀Si₄₀ possess the highest thermal stability, remaining amorphous to a temperature of 1000 to 1100 °C in vacuum. Additionally, this AMTF forms a stable surface oxide when annealed in oxygen up to 700 °C. To demonstrate TIJ feasibility, Ta₃₀W₃₀Si₄₀ resistors are fabricated and stressed in an open-pool test bed. Ta₃₀W₃₀Si₄₀ AMTFs remain amorphous after testing to > 10 ⁷ pulses. This suggests that Ta₃₀W₃₀Si₄₀ is a promising AMTF candidate material for TIJ applications. Ta-based AMTFs are also employed as bottom electrodes in metal-insulator-metal tunnel diodes in order to demonstrate their potential for microelectronic applications...|$|R
40|$|Injuries to {{the hands}} are common among astronauts who train for extravehicular {{activity}} (EVA). When the gloves are pressurized, they restrict movement and create pressure points during tasks, sometimes resulting in pain, muscle fatigue, abrasions, and occasionally more severe injuries such as onycholysis. A {{brief review of}} the Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health's injury database reveals that 58 % of total astronaut hand and arm injuries from NBL training between 1993 and 2010 occurred either to the fingernail, MCP, or fingertip. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the potential of using small sensors to measure force acting on the fingers and hand within pressurized gloves and other variables such as blood perfusion, skin temperature, humidity, fingernail strain, skin moisture, among others. Tasks were performed gloved and ungloved in a pressurizable glove box. The test demonstrated that fingernails saw greater transverse strain levels for tension or compression than for longitudinal strain, even during axial fingertip loading. Blood perfusion peaked and dropped as the finger deformed during finger presses, indicating an initial dispersion and decrease of blood perfusion levels. Force sensitive <b>resistors</b> to force <b>plate</b> comparisons showed similar force curve patterns as fingers were depressed, indicating suitable functionality for future testing. Strategies for proper placement and protection of these sensors for ideal data collection and longevity through the test session were developed and will be implemented going forward for future testing...|$|R
40|$|Passive components, {{primarily}} resistors and capacitors, make up {{the majority}} of components for electronic circuits. Cost and performance are critical factors while size becomes important in hand held devices. Integrated passive components promise breakthroughs in performance, size, and eventually cost However, poor economic and business conditions have hampered the infrastructure development needed for widespread deployment of integrated passive components. This economic weakness has also made designers more risk evasive in the evaluation of new technologies. The 2002 NEMI Roadmap finds that performance is the main driver for embedded passives while the lack of design and simulation tools, and test equipment is the primary hindrance to the technology development. In spite of the problems, embedded passive component implementation has been accomplished by manufacturers who have internally developed design tools to circumvent the infrastructure weakness. The NEMI Roadmap has established new metrics to quantify and compare space savings for comparing discrete passives with integrated passive alternatives. New cost models have allowed us to evaluate the alternative passive component technologies. The space savings, component count savings, board size savings, and conversion cost savings are weighed against higher materials costs. The technical needs and infrastructure needs are spelled out for thin core laminates, ceramic loaded pastes, <b>plated</b> <b>resistors,</b> thin film resistor foils and polymer thick film resistors.
