These results suggest that the endurance time significantly changes even when the surface shape changes only slightly. In addition, the risk curve used in this study did not include the effect of local stress concentration. As mentioned above, it suggests that the stress concentration occurs over the large convex. Moreover, the existence of stress concentration was verified by visualizing the pressure distribution {{on the surface of the}} device. A tactile sensor sheet (I-SCAN, Nitta Corporation, Japan), which could measure the normal force exerted on square cells lined on the surface, was used. By putting this flexible sheet on the uneven surface, the concentration of normal force was roughly observed via a <b>rubbing</b> <b>test.</b> The observed force concentration made the endurance time short, as shown in the risk curve.|$|E

MethodsThis was a prospective study of 20 patients undergoing elective CEA. During CEA, before removal of the atheroma, intraluminal stretch simulation of the carotid baroreceptors (<b>rub</b> <b>test)</b> was performed before and after injection of 1 % lignocaine into adventitial tissue of the artery in the region of the carotid sinus. Continuous measurements of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), electrocardiographic r-r intervals (R-R), heart rate, cardiac vagal tone, and carotid sinus baroreflex were recorded to determine alterations in baroreceptor function. ResultsRub test before injection of lignocaine was associated with a decrease in MAP and heart rate and an increase in R-R, cardiac vagal tone, and carotid baroreflex response, indicating a functioning baroreflex. After lignocaine injection and repetition of the <b>rub</b> <b>test,</b> no significant change was seen in MAP, heart rate, R-R, cardiac vagal tone, or carotid baroreflex response, indicating a nonfunctioning baroreflex. Comparing the peak responses to the <b>rub</b> <b>test</b> stimulus before and after lignocaine injection showed significant differences for all variables (P <. 05), with carotid baroreflex response and heart rate being highly significant (P <. 0005). ConclusionsThe baroreflex response to intraluminal stretch stimulation of the carotid sinus area is operational in patients undergoing CEA, and this response is abolished by infiltration of local anesthetic into the periadventitial tissue around the carotid sinus...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: Blood {{pressure}} instability after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) {{has been}} associated with a disturbance of the baroreflex control mechanism caused by the surgery in the carotid sinus region. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if a deterioration in carotid baroreceptors occurs during the surgery. Method: Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were recorded continuously in 60 patients undergoing CEA as well as preoperatively and postoperatively at 2 days and 6 weeks. The baroreflex sensitivity was determined by cross-spectral analysis of HR and systolic blood pressure (SBP). During the surgery, three tests were used to assess the baroreflex response. The first test simulated a sudden fall in systemic blood pressure by clamping the common carotid artery. The second test simulated a rise in systemic blood pressure by applying pressure by using a rubbing action on the luminal surface of the carotid sinus region. The <b>rub</b> <b>test</b> was performed twice, once with the atheromatous plaque in situ and once when the plaque had been removed. The third test is clamp removal and restoration of blood flow through the carotid sinus. Results: Carotid cross-clamping increased mean ± standard error of the mean SBP from 117 ± 3 mm Hg before clamping to 125 ± 3 mm Hg (P <. 05) at 30 beats after clamping. The first <b>rub</b> <b>test</b> with the plaque in situ decreased SBP from 121 ± 3 mm Hg to 117 ± 3 mm Hg (P <. 01) at 10 beats after the <b>rub</b> <b>test,</b> indicating a functioning baroreceptor reflex. The second <b>rub</b> <b>test</b> increased SBP from 126 ± 3 mm Hg to 128 ± 3 mm Hg (P <. 05). SBP dropped (P <. 01) when unclamping suggesting a selective alteration of the baroreflex sensitivity. The baroreflex sensitivity was significantly reduced 2 days postoperatively when compared to preoperative values (P <. 05). Conclusions: These findings suggest that the act of plaque removal could be associated with a partial disruption of baroreceptor mechanism in the carotid artery. This could affect type I baroreceptors. (J Vasc Surg 2002; 36 : 793 - 8. ...|$|R

In this study, a 2 μm thick coating with 12 sub-layers of CrN and TiN is deposited alternately {{on the surface}} of magnesium alloy AZ 91 by a novel method of arc-glow plasma depositing to improve its wear resistance. The composition and microstructure of the coating layer are analyzed by means of SEM, XRD and GDS. The friction coefficient is measured by ball on disc <b>rubbing</b> <b>test,</b> and the wear rates are also calculated.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for comparing {{the resistance to}} penetration by aqueous fluids, under rubbing contact, of a representative series of fabrics. Untreated woven fabrics are rapidly penetrated, but some non-woven synthetic materials resist penetration for much longer and tightly woven proofed cotton fabrics for prolonged periods, even after repeated washing and sterilizing. If a wetting agent is added to water, penetration occurs more quickly, but fabrics containing natural cotton are penetrated more slowly by serum. The same fabrics were examined by a test designed to simulate transfer of dry particulate material, e. g. skin scales, through them during nursing contact. The proportionate differences observed were much greater than for air dispersal during exercise and closely resembled those obtained by a laboratory <b>rubbing</b> <b>test.</b> In particular, one of the non-woven fabrics showed much greater relative penetration when examined by these methods than the relative dispersal of skin scales through it during exercise...|$|E
40|$|The {{irritant}} {{potency of}} 5 types of insulation wools (2 types of rockwool and 3 types of glasswool) were studied {{on the basis}} of their differences in diameter by a standardized <b>rubbing</b> <b>test.</b> Assessment was done by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and erythema scores. Insulation wools show a wide distribution of the diameter around the mean. Of the rockwool material, 30 % consisted of small grains, called ''shot''. The control test site did not change over time; thus, the rubbing procedure itself does not seem to contribute to the skin reactions. All fibre types proved to be irritant to the skin. The irritant reactions did not correspond with the mean diameter, although the fibre type with the smallest diameter was the least irritant and the fibre type with the largest diameter the strongest. The presence of ''shot'' had a significant effect on the LDF responses. ''Shot'' and the distribution around the mean diameter may play a role in eliciting the skin irritation by insulation wools...|$|E

30|$|The {{effect of}} surface shape {{variance}} {{of the human}} body on the interaction force at the contact area when using a wearable robot was estimated in this study. For this purpose, a device that can mimic the unevenness and variance of the human shape, was developed. Then, the performance of the device was confirmed by comparing the characteristics of the device to that of an actual human. Because of the greater unevenness and individuality of the surface shape, the experiment, which mimicked the contact between the human body and the cuff of the wearable robot, targeted the ASIS of the human. The result of the <b>rubbing</b> <b>test</b> using the device and the robotic cuff attached to the manipulator suggests that the interaction force applied to the surface changed approximately 10 % as the height at the iliac spine changed ± 1  mm. Furthermore, this difference probably affects the endurance time, which is an index of the contact safety, significantly under the severe condition. Thus, this study suggests that considering the individual difference in the characteristics of human tissue and surface is important for the safety design of a wearable robot.|$|E
30|$|The {{tribological}} {{behaviors of}} {{two types of}} seal coatings, nickel–graphite and aluminum–hexagon-boron nitride (Ni–Cg and Al–hBN, respectively) versus a Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade used in turbofan engines were investigated using a high-speed <b>rubbing</b> <b>test.</b> The wear status and damage mechanism of the friction couples were studied and the abradability of the seal coatings was evaluated. By analysis of the coating properties and damage mechanism of the seal couple, the friction heat effect was identified as the key factor influencing blade wear forms as well as coating abradability. A one-dimensional heat conduction model was established to estimate the effect of increasing temperature on the friction interface. The results indicated that in the Ni–Cg and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V seal couple, the temperature rising rate (TRR) of the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade was faster {{than that of the}} Ni–Cg coating, and so the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade softened earlier than the Ni–Cg coating, causing the blade to suffer severe wear. In the Al–hBN and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V seal couple, the TRR of the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade was slower than that of the Al–hBN coating, and so the Al–hBN coating softened first; thus, blade damage was reduced or even replaced by coating adhesion. The square root ratio of thermal diffusivity between the blade and the coating could be taken as an indicator of the ratio of TRR between the blade and coating to predict blade wear status as well as damage mechanism. The results of the model agreed well with the experiment results of the two seal couples used in this study.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} has been initiated to assist the fish scales entrepreneur in Malaysia into getting a consistent fish scales dye process. Several tests on colouring dyes have been conducted to establish a suitable dye with consistent measuring techniques. With the above objectives in mind, the researcher hoped to establish a colour guideline in form of colour tones thus provides a wider choice of colour selection to these entrepreneurs. John Snapper or Golden Snapper " Jenahak" from (Lutjanus johni family), Malabar Red Snapper "Merah" from (Lutjanus malabaricus family), Threadfish Bream" Kerisi" from (Nemipteridae family) and Herring or Toli Shad" Terubok" from (Clupeidae family) were the four types of salt water fish selected for their scales for this research as {{they are the most}} caught by Malaysian fishermen. In the early stage of this experiment the researcher tried to find a suitable cleaning substance and process to wash these fish scales. Three types of cleaning agent were then tested such as detergent, lime juice and bleach. Ofthe three, lime juice produced the best result. Some other experiments conducted were the crushing test, burning test, pounding test and baking test. They are to determine the durability quality of these fish scales. The fish scales were then tested for colouring suitability. Five different types of fabric dyes were selected such as disperse dye, reactive dye, vat dye, pigment dye and natural dye. Out of these five types, Cool Reactive dye from Remazol brand gave the best colour reaction on these scales. The weighing technique was then established using grams for colours and litre for measuring water. Prior to this the researcher had used a spoon for measuring the colour quantity and cups for measuring the amount of water where it produced an inconsistent colour tones. Based on the colour tones obtained from the experiments, the researcher were able to establish an array ofcolours in the form of colour codes. A colour fastness test were conducted on these coloured scales using test methods such as <b>rubbing</b> <b>test,</b> daylight test and soaking in sulphuric acid. Apart from the above discoveries, the researcher was also able to find other valuable information to be shared with. They include the size, shape, thickness and texture of the scales which were different for all the four types of fish. The resilient characteristic of the scales made it difficult to tear or crushed. However, the colour absorption on these fish scales is being influenced by its thickness. As for the recommendation, this research can be used as reference for producing wider range of handicraft products and products in form ofjewelleries or sequins. The colours can further be experimented using natural dye on other types of salt water or fresh water fish. Batik decoration techniques can be applied on a bigger size fish scales...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of new Additive Manufacturing techniques helps to overtake design constrains characterizing the standard processes. This new reality can opens the space to the redesign of more efficient aircraft engine components. The engine turbine labyrinth seal honeycomb land is currently obtained shaping and welding a sheet metal to create an hexagon pattern. The employing of the DMLM additive manufacturing could led to the {{development of}} new geometries, different from the standard honeycomb land, able to increase the labyrinth sealing performances. In this research, innovative stator patterns, able to reduce the seal leakage mass flow rate, have been investigated. The identification of innovative lining pattern cell shapes has been performed by using numerical CFD analyses. The selection of the innovative lining pattern cell shapes has been performed among all numerical solutions investigated. The most promising solutions have been then experimentally verified. Firstly, a dedicated work has been accomplished, to verify whether ANSYS CFX code was capable of predicting labyrinth seal performances adequately in terms of mass flow leakage. Then, a dedicated simplified model has been developed, in order to explore the performances of new designs with a reasonable computational cost. An extended CFD analysis, on the honeycomb stepped labyrinth seal, has been performed, in order to investigate the stator part geometrical parameters affecting the discharge coefficient. A one-at-a-time approach has been employed, to investigate: cell wall thickness, cell depth, cell diameter and fin tip thickness. Moreover, the effect of varying the fin tip and cell relative position has been evaluated. Numerical results, for both convergent and divergent flow conditions, have been obtained and analyzed in terms of leakage variations. The obtained results are in good agreement with the data available in the literature. The analysis has highlighted the cell diameter as the most influencing geometrical parameter, for honeycomb labyrinth seal stator part. In order to define innovative stator lining cell shapes, some assumptions for the honeycomb labyrinth seal rubbing and thermal behaviors have been employed. Nineteen solutions have been numerically investigated, by leveraging on the knowledge in simulations acquired from the previous activity. A numerical model, of a double fin straight honeycomb labyrinth seal, able to reproduce engine conditions, has been implemented. CFD results have shown how the rhomboidal geometry could give a sensible improvement in the sealing performances. Two of the rhomboidal shapes analyzed have been flow tested, on a static rig, that was reproducing the same labyrinth seal geometry numerically investigated. The test samples have been manufactured by using the DMLM technique at 1 x scale. The measurements performed, for several running clearances and pressure ratios, are then compared with the standard honeycomb seal data and numerical pre-test predictions. The rhomboidal cells thermal response has been tested in a facility available at the Energy Department of the Politecnico di Torino. The test rig is able to reproduce the outer band static part of a low pressure turbine stage and the blade tip labyrinth seal. It is working at high temperature and has been dimensioned in order to reproduce, in engine similitude, the non-dimensional numbers ruling LPT turbines thermal phenomena. The test article has been designed by integrating the innovative cells into the complete stepped shroud design. The part has been manufactured by means of DMLM technique.

Using the data from these investigations as a reference, <b>rub</b> <b>tests</b> have been conducted on a specially designed high-speed—high-temperature rig. The many correlations obtained between test values and wear mechanisms allow the generation of ‘wear mechanism maps’ for coatings of the AlSi-plastic family.

During the dyeing experiments, for each trial, the dye-bath exhaustion curves has been determined by using an UV-Vis spectrophotometer and by detecting the other parameters (pH, temperature) with an online diagnostic equipment. For every dyeing isotherm, the apparent activation energy of the dyeing kinetics was calculated. In addition color fastness, artificial light and <b>rubbing</b> <b>tests,</b> which are related to the fabric quality, were measured. The research allowed the definition of the parameters which play have the most relevant role in the dyeing "ultrasonic" proces...|$|R
30|$|Light {{fastness}} of the dyed samples {{was conducted}} on Digi light Nx™, having water cooled by Mercury Blended Tungsten lamp, according to test method ISO 105 -B 02 : 1994 (Amd. 2 : 2000). Wash fastness was measured in Digi wash SS™ (Laundrometer) as per the ISO 105 -C 06 : 1994 (2010) specifications. Dry and wet rub fastness of dyed samples were tested using Digi crock™ (Crockmeter) as per Indian standard IS 766 : 1988 (reaffirmed 2004) based on ISO 105 -X 12 : 2001 by mounting the fabric on a panel and giving ten strokes for {{both dry and wet}} <b>rub</b> fastness <b>tests.</b> The samples were assessed for staining on white adjacent fabric (cotton and wool).|$|R
40|$|Two {{strength}} level {{variations of}} sintered NiCrAl (about 40 percent dense), candidate high pressure turbine seal materials, {{were subject to}} <b>rub</b> tolerance <b>testing</b> against AM 355 steel blade tips. The high strength material (17 N/sq mm tensile strength) showed frictional and radial loads that were 20 to 50 percent higher than those measured for the low strength material (15. 5 N/ sq mm tensile strength). Measured wear to the AM 355 blade tips was not significantly different for the two sintered NiCrAl seal materials. Wear of the sintered NiCrAl was characterized by material removal to a depth greater than the depth to which blade tips were driven into the seal, indicating self-erosion effects...|$|R
40|$|In aero engines a {{thermally}} sprayed abradable {{material is}} applied {{to the inside of the}} casing in order to provide a seal around the blade tips of the compressor blades. During running and handling the blades cut a channel into the abradable material. This rub is poorly understood and often results in blade wear and poor sealing particularly in the later stages of the compressor. This thesis aims to investigate and characterise these rubs and provide recommendations for changes to the running and handling procedure, the abradable or the blade tip that will improve sealing and reduce blade wear. The AlSi polyester vs Ti(6 Al 4 V) and NiCrAl bentonite vs Inconel 718 rubs have been investigated through high speed <b>rub</b> <b>testing.</b> The effect of incursion rate, blade speed and abradable hardness have been investigated. Wear mechanisms have been proposed and clarified by further high speed wear testing and microstructure modelling. In addition several possible tip modifications have been tested and a successful modification has been extensively characterised. The wear mechanism was found to depend on the materials and the incursion rate while the abradable batch and, in the case of the NiCrAl bentonite abradable, the blade speed affected the severity of the mechanism. The AlSi based abradable cut at high incursion rates but wore by adhesion on to the blade an abrasion at low incursion rates. The NiCrAl bentonite abradable wore by local compaction and subsurface damage. At low incursion rate material was removed fast enough to accommodate the incursion but at higher incursion rates blade wear and compaction of the abradable were observed...|$|R
40|$|A unique {{modified}} {{formula of}} hot-melt ink for phase change printing process was developed. A composition useful for 3 D printing comprises different waxes, tackifier and plasticizer resins, rheology modifiers, and UV curable resin and/or gas releasing agent. Differential scanning calorimetry {{was used to}} evaluate thermal properties of the ink components and the extensive study of the thermal behavior of the proposed gas releasing agents has been carried out. The rheology behavior of inks and printability such as image detail, definition of dots (sharpness of the edges), dot formation, and spreading were investigated. Dot heights were measured by a modified method using a First Ten Angstrom dynamic contact angle instrument. Sutherland <b>Rub</b> resistance <b>test</b> was also used together with tape adhesion tests for ink adhesion monitoring...|$|R
30|$|To {{determine}} the effects of these additives, the most important print properties of the ink with modified formulation are analyzed- namely, adhesion, rub resistance, and gloss. Adhesion and rub resistance are two important mechanical properties, while gloss is an optical property that is deemed important in many applications, such as in packaging. To evaluate ink performance and analyze ink formulations, modern techniques and classical chemical tests are done by manufacturers to establish quality and applicability of their products [7], as well as standard test methods that involve qualitative assessment. While there is a quantitative standard test method for gloss such as the ASTM Standard Test Method for Specular Gloss D 523 - 14, adhesion and <b>rub</b> resistance <b>test</b> methods are mostly qualitative, such as the color fastness analysis on a grey scale for <b>testing</b> <b>rub</b> resistance [8] and ASTM F 2252 - 03 peel test [9]. Hence, quantitative methods for evaluating adhesion and rub resistance must be developed to obtain more accurate and reliable results and to allow for performing optimization with the quantitative gloss measurements. In this study, an image-based technique is developed and employed to quantify adhesion and rub resistance, and to analyze the effects of varying the relative amounts of the three additives on the three identified print properties. After gathering and analyzing the results, a formulation that would give best print properties is identified by using optimization methods.|$|R
