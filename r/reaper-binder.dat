2500|$|A twine binder is a {{mechanical}} device or machine that wraps knotted twine around a bundle or sheave of grain in bound form {{after it has}} been reaped. While working at a farm in Whitewater, Wisconsin in 1857, John Appleby invented the twine knotter. Incorporating many of Jacob Behel's innovations as found in his development of the [...] "billhook" [...] knotter in 1864, Appleby later sold the patent around the year 1877 to William Deering who began the manufacturing and exploited the practicability of Appleby's twine knotter into a commercially profitable <b>reaper-binder.</b>|$|E

5000|$|When corn stover is {{harvested}} intact (as {{opposed to}} the whole plant being chopped for silage, or the stover being left in the field by a combine), it can be cut and gathered by corn binders, which are <b>reaper-binders</b> designed specifically for maize (for example, [...] ). It can also be baled into large round bales.|$|R
50|$|Separate <b>reaper-binders</b> and {{threshers}} {{have largely}} been replaced by machines that combine all of their functions, that is combine harvesters or combines. However, the simpler machines remain important as appropriate technology in low-capital farming contexts, both in developing countries and in developed countries on small farms that strive for especially high levels of self-sufficiency. For example, pedal-powered threshers are a low-cost option, and some Amish sects use horse-drawn binders and old-style threshers.|$|R

5000|$|... 1938 This was {{the year}} that <b>reaper-binder</b> ML6 was presented, the first Italian model, forerunner ofa series of {{machines}} that was to influence Italian grain cultivation for decades. It was with this machine that Laverda entered the harvesting machine sector.|$|E
5000|$|Before such {{machines}} were developed, threshing {{was done by}} hand with flails: such hand threshing was very laborious and time-consuming, taking about one-quarter of agricultural labor by the 18th century. [...] Mechanization of this process removed {{a substantial amount of}} drudgery from farm labor. The first threshing machine was invented circa 1786 by the Scottish engineer Andrew Meikle, and the subsequent adoption of such machines was one of the earlier examples of the mechanization of agriculture. During the 19th century, threshers and mechanical reapers and <b>reaper-binders</b> gradually became widespread and made grain production much less laborious.|$|R
50|$|The {{start of}} the Claas group took place in 1913 when August Claas, {{developed}} the company in Clarholz, Germany. In 1919, the business was transferred to Harsewinkel, Germany, where the company focused on the production of reapers. Two years later the company obtained their first patent - for a knotter to efficiently bind straw. In 1930, the first Harvester was developed with the European market in mind with the first Pick-up Baler following in 1934. In 1936 Claas started to market the first combine harvester built in Europe, as opposed to imported machines previously available. They then offered trailed combine harvesters (<b>reaper-binders)</b> to the European market.|$|R
50|$|For {{production}} agriculture, {{past and}} present, two-wheel tractors accept {{a wide range}} of implements, such as the following: For soil-working: rototillers, moldboard plows, disc-plows, rotary plows, root/tuber harvesting plows, small subsoiler plows, powered and non-powered harrows, seeders, transplanters, and planters. Even zero till/no-till planters and seeders have become available. In plant protection and weed control, two-wheel tractor implements consist of various inter-cultivators and sprayers. For harvesting, available implements are: Forage: Sickle bar mowers, disk mowers, hayrakes, hay tedders, haybalers and bale wrappers silage production. For grain harvest: reaper/grain harvesters, <b>reaper-binders,</b> and even combine harvesters are available typically only for Asian two-wheel tractors. For transport, trailers with capacities from 0.5 to 5 plus ton cargoes are available. General mowing implements consist of lawn mowers, brush mowers, and flail mowers. For snow removal, implements consist of snowblowers, power sweepers, and snow/dozer blades. Other implements include: chipper/shredders, log splitters, electrical generator, pressure washer, crimper-roller, fertilizer/salt/lime spreader, and stump grinder. This list of implements (which may not be complete) means that two-wheel tractors can execute practically all of the chores done by larger 4-wheel tractors, with the exception of items like front-loaders, which obviously have the physical stability requirements of a 4-wheel (two-axle) tractor.|$|R
50|$|He made memorable {{experiments}} on the mechanic threshing, {{on the new}} steam-powered oil mills, on the <b>reaper-binder</b> Aultmann, on the mowers Johnson e Aultmann, on the seed drill Cosimini, on the shelling machine Navacchi and machine press Blunt for conservation of forage into silos.|$|E
50|$|Generally, reapers {{developed}} into the 1872 invented <b>reaper-binder,</b> which reaped the crop and bound it into sheaves. By 1896, 400,000 reaper-binders were {{estimated to be}} harvesting grain. This was in turn replaced by the swather and eventually the combine harvester, which reaps and threshes in one operation.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical reapers {{substantially}} changed agriculture {{from their}} {{appearance in the}} 1830s until the 1860s through 1880s, when they evolved into related machines, often called by different names (self-raking reaper, harvester, <b>reaper-binder,</b> grain binder, binder), that collected and bound the sheaves of grain with wire or twine. Today reapers and grain binders have been largely replaced by combines in commercial farming, but some smaller farms still use them.|$|E
2500|$|Before World War II, most maize in North America was {{harvested}} by hand. This {{involved a}} {{large numbers of}} workers and associated social events (husking or shucking bees). From the 1890s onward, some machinery became available to partially mechanize the processes, such as one- and two-row mechanical pickers (picking the ear, leaving the stover) and corn binders, which are <b>reaper-binders</b> designed specifically for maize (for example, [...] ). The latter produce sheaves that can be shocked. By hand or mechanical picker, the entire ear is harvested, which then requires a separate operation of a maize sheller to remove the kernels from the ear. Whole ears of maize were often stored in corn cribs, and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Today corn cribs with whole ears, and corn binders, are less common because most modern farms harvest the grain from the field with a combine and store it in bins. The combine with a corn head (with points and snap rolls instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down. The stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground, where it usually is left to become organic matter for the soil. The ear of maize is too large to pass between slots in a plate as the snap rolls pull the stalk away, leaving only the ear and husk to enter the machinery. The combine separates out the husk and the cob, keeping only the kernels.|$|R
50|$|On May 10, 1933, {{a half-mile}} wide F4 tornado struck the small {{community}} of Beatty Swamps (also {{referred to as}} Bethsadia). The tornado destroyed every structure in the town and either killed or injured nearly every inhabitant, with 33 of the 35 deaths occurring in the area. Much of the area was swept clean of debris, a <b>reaper-binder</b> was thrown 500 yd, and cars were moved hundreds of feet.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>reaper-binder,</b> or binder, was a farm {{implement}} that improved upon the reaper. The binder {{was invented in}} 1872 by Charles Baxter Withington (September 10, 1830 (Akron, Ohio) - December 12, 1909 (Janesville, Wisconsin)), a jeweler from Janesville, Wisconsin. In addition to cutting the small-grain crop, it would also tie the stems into small bundles, or [...] These sheaves were then 'shocked' into conical stooks, resembling small tipis, to allow the grain to dry for several days before being threshed.|$|E
50|$|In 1862 the United States Congress {{passed the}} Homestead Act {{which led to}} the {{settlement}} of {{a large part of the}} Midwest. The United States also witnessed a great increase in railways, mainly across the prairies. In 1860 the United States possessed about 30,800 miles of railways; by 1880 this had increased to about 94,200 miles. The railway companies encouraged farmer-settlers by promising to transport their crops for less than cost for a number of years. Due to the technological progress of shipping, there was for the first time plenty of cheap steam ships to transport their crops across the seas. This drove down transport costs: in 1873 the cost of transporting a ton of grain from Chicago to Liverpool was £3 7s., in 1880 it was £2 1s. and in 1884 £1 4s. New inventions in agricultural machinery also aided the American prairie farmer. Due to the scarcity of hired farm labourers, prairie farmers had to collect their own harvest and the limit of their expansion was set by what one pair of hands could do. The advent of the <b>reaper-binder</b> in 1873 revolutionised harvesting because it meant the doubling of every farmer's crop as it enabled the reaping to be worked by one man instead of two. For these reasons, cheap imports of vast amounts of American prairie wheat were able to flood the market and undercut and overwhelm British wheat farmers.|$|E
50|$|In 1293, Reiffelbach had {{its first}} {{documentary}} mention as Rifelbach. At this time, {{one third of}} the tithes were given as a fief by the knight Sir Eberhard of Odenbach to his wife Agnes. In 1321 came the first documentary mention of a chapel in Reiffelbach, belonging to the Order of Malta. In 1370, Reiffelbach was mentioned as Ryffelbach and Riffelbach. In 1387, Reiffelbach was bound to the mill on the Glan in Odenbach, making that mill, as part of the feudal estate, the only one that villagers from Reiffelbach could use. This mill ran until 1938. In the early 15th century, the village’s name appeared in documents in several different forms, among which were Rifelbach (1401), Ryffelbach (1404), Riffelbach (1406) and Rieffelbach (1440). In 1453, the first miners were recorded in neighbouring Odenbach. In 1485, the Reiffelbach church was transferred to the Otterberg Monastery at Meisenheim. In 1510, the village’s name was recorded as ryffelbach. The earliest mention of winegrowing dates from 1516, and this continued for centuries, finally ending in the 1960s. In 1526, the Reformation was introduced into Meisenheim, with its inevitable attendant effect in Reiffelbach, given the ecclesiastical link. In the years leading up to 1600, there was coal mining in Reiffelbach. Dating from 1601 is a boundary stone that was found on the Lehenberg, at the limit with Schmittweiler. In 1667, the village’s name was recorded as Reyffelbach. In 1683, some Franciscans came to Meisenheim. These were the first Catholics to show up in the area since the Reformation. After the Nine Years' War (1688-1697; known in Germany as the Pfälzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), Reiffelbach’s chapel had fallen into disrepair, {{but it was not until}} 1721 that it was put back in order. Then, it was used by all three faiths, Catholics, Lutherans and Calvinists. In 1724, the village’s name was recorded as Reifelbach. In 1739, some families emigrated. In 1740, new applications were being made for leave to prospect for coal. From 1750 to 1758, there was a glassworks, the Christianshütte, in Reiffelbach which employed 23 workers and made windowglass. Dating from 1776 is another boundary stone that was found in the Scherbelswald (forest). That same year, a homage list was published. In 1786, there were four coal pits being worked in Hollerbach (rural cadastral area). In 1815, as a result of the Congress of Vienna, Reiffelbach found itself in the Oberamt of Meisenheim in the Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg. In 1832, a new schoolhouse was built in the village centre. In 1835, the chapel was torn down and auctioned. In 1846, coal mining occupied 378 ha. In 1849, a new church was built. In 1869, a miners’ association was founded. In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, passing troops occupied the village. In 1875, the men’s singing club was founded. In 1885, a new alignment for the road to Roth/Odenbach was laid out. Reiffelbach, Gangloff and Becherbach were beset by a heavy storm. In 1910, the Reiffelbach villager Peter Stein earned the village’s first driving licence. In 1912, the primary school was built. Only two years later, the First World War broke out. After it ended, those men from the village who had fallen or gone missing had their names engraved on the local war memorial. In 1920, electric light made its first appearance in Reiffelbach, while the Hollerbach and Pfarrwiese coal pits were closed; the Abrech I and II pits remained open, however. In 1921, the municipality decided that it was going to keep wild boars and goats, and also that year, a fire brigade was established in which all the village’s men between the ages of 16 and 50 were required to serve. Although electric light was first seen in Reiffelbach in 1920, it was only in 1925 that the village was hooked up to the electrical grid. In 1926, the village’s first threshing machine went into use, threshing the harvest at each of the local farms. The first motorcycle ever seen in Reiffelbach was ridden by villager Eduard Gräff in 1927. In 1929, an almshouse was built, and a postbus route was established from Odenbach by way of Reiffelbach to Dielkirchen. In 1931 the village saw its first <b>reaper-binder</b> go into service. In 1933, Flurbereinigung was undertaken in Reiffelbach by the Flurbereinigungsamt Neustadt (Neustadt Land Consolidation Office), and also in that year, a sporting ground was laid out in the Hartwiesen (this is now tennis courts). From 1934 to 1936, the municipal woodland “In der Muhl” was cleared; today this land is meadows. In 1935, another postbus route was established, this one running from Meisenheim by way of Reiffelbach to Dielkirchen. Despite the years of postbus service that the village had already seen, it was not until 1936 that Reiffelbach had its first car owner. It was the village schoolteacher, Müller. In 1938, the eighth school year was introduced, as was vocational school, which was compulsory. Also compulsory for many was service in the Wehrmacht, which became all too common with the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. In 1945, German soldiers - Prussians - retreated through the village on their way to Roth; for a while, an artillery unit was stationed in the “Muhl”, which had been cleared some years earlier. That same year, the war ended and Germany was occupied by the victorious Allies (Reiffelbach found itself in the French zone). Once again, the fallen and missing had their names engraved on the local war memorial. This time also saw some private coal mining at the Hollerbach pit. Yet another postbus route, Landkraftpostlinie II (beginning from Rockenhausen), was instituted in 1948, and also that year, the farmers’ and winegrowers’ association was founded, although winegrowing would only continue in the village for another two decades or so; a conversation club was founded the next year. In 1952, a new, second bell was dedicated at the church, and it was decided that the village would keep a municipal bull. In 1953, the local chapter of the VdK, a social advocacy group, was founded. In 1954, some major work was undertaken on the waterworks, formerly centred at the coal galleries at the Hollerbach pits. There was now a high water cistern to pipe water into houses. Also in 1954, the monument of honour was built at the graveyard. In 1958, the shooting club “Tell” was founded, and the old schoolteacher’s dwelling in the village centre was torn down. The same was done with the schoolhouse itself the following year, and the hunting association was founded. In 1960, the village’s namesake brook, the Reiffelbach, was channelled into an underground pipe, and sewerage was laid in the streets. A new schoolteacher’s dwelling was built in the lower village in 1961. In 1962, the football and sport club FSV Reiffelbach was founded. Also in the early and mid 1960s, a number of measures were undertaken by the forestry office to expand the village’s woodlands. See Land use above. In 1966, a sporting ground was laid out in the Hollerbach, where the shooting club’s clubhouse was also built at about the same time. In 1967, school grade levels 5 to 8 were transferred to the Gemeinschaftsschule (roughly “comprehensive school”) in nearby Meisenheim. In 1968, the “women’s singing circle” was founded. In 1968, the old parish hall in the village centre was torn down. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, Reiffelbach was transferred from the Kusel district to the Bad Kreuznach district in 1969. That same year, the church organ was dedicated. In 1970, school grade levels 1 to 4, too, were transferred to Meisenheim, and thereafter the schoolhouse was used as the parish hall. The compulsory-service fire brigade that had been set up in 1921 at last became a volunteer fire brigade in 1971. In 1972, the old schoolhouse was converted into a church hall with kitchen and side rooms. In 1975, a fire brigade promotional association was founded. There was a change in ecclesiastical organization this year, too, one that saw the Evangelical community transferred from the parish of Gangloff to the parish of Odenbach. In 1979, Gangloff was hooked up to the sewage treatment plant in Reiffelbach. In 1981, Reiffelbach was granted the right to bear a coat of arms. The tennis club was founded in 1982. In 1985, a clock was built into the churchtower. In 1987, the village was connected to the Westpfalz (West Palatinate) drinking water supply. Work began in 1990 on a new fire station, and it was dedicated in 1992. In 1993, Reiffelbach celebrated 700 years of existence (at least since the first documentary mention), and a municipal flag was approved for use. Ecclesiastically, Reiffelbach belongs, as it long has, to the Evangelical Church of the Palatinate and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Speyer.|$|E
40|$|In Italy Origanum vulgare L. is {{cultivated}} only in {{few areas}} and its production {{does not even}} satisfy the national market demand. Until now the interest on this crop has been very low {{because of the high}} cost of manual harvest and bunch binding.

40|$|Tests for {{evaluating}} the agronomical response of Origanum to four plant densities were carried out from 1998 to 2001, on a local biotype of Origanum collected at Monreale (Palermo), in an area having the typical soil and climatic conditions of the Sicilian environment. Data about plant biometric characteristics (height at different growth phases, number of branches per plant, fresh weight yield) and the proportions among inflorescences, leaves and stems were monitored. Moreover, essential oil analyses were carried out for each plant density. The {{results showed that the}} plant density influenced the yield but not the plant height. The best results were obtained in the second year, when the highest values of biometric characteristics were measured.

40|$|Harvest {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agronomical techniques of oregano cultivation. Traditionally, oregano is manually harvested but the times of this operation are very long. On the contrary, the mechanical harvest could decrease the harvest times and, therefore, the production costs. Tests of mechanical harvest were carried out between 2003 and 2004 in an experimental field of Dipartimento di Agronomia Ambientale e Territoriale of Palermo University, using a <b>reaper-binder</b> made by BCS for cereal and forage crops but specifically modified for harvesting oregano. The working capacity, productivity and efficiency of this machine were evaluated according to the variation of minimum forward speed, minimum cutting height, number of stems per bunch and the lowering of the bunch binding height; the results were also compared to those obtained during the manual harvest. An Origanum biotype harvested in Monreale (Palermo) and classified as Origanum vulgare L. ssp hirtum (Link) Ietswaart (or O. heracleoticum L.), called “Monrealese”, was cultivated in simple and twice rows. During the tests of mechanical and manual harvest the various times were measured, in order to determine the working capacity, productivity and efficiency. Also the working quality, in terms of bunch weight, length and binding height were measured. The working capacity and productivity obtained during the mechanical harvest resulted higher rather than those obtained during the manual harvest...|$|E
