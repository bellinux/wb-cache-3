5|$|Dracula's Daughter was {{the last}} in the first cycle of Universal Horror films that <b>reached</b> <b>back</b> into the 1920s. Publicly, Universal {{said it was because}} a British ban on horror films would cut too deeply into the revenue such films could generate. In truth, the cycle was {{suspended}} because, just before filming on Dracula's Daughter had wrapped, the Laemmle family had lost control of Universal. Because of cost overruns on a number of pictures, Junior Laemmle was forced to borrow $1,000,000 on November 1, 1935. The money came from J. Cheever Cowdin, head of the Standard Capital Corporation, and from Charles R. Rogers. When the loan was called in March of the following year, Universal was unable to repay it. Standard assumed control of the studio on March 4, 1936 and Rogers replaced Junior as head of production. Rogers did not like horror films and he shut down production on them following the release of Dracula's Daughter to focus on fare like Deanna Durbin musicals. Universal would not return to the horror genre for three years, when it released Son of Frankenstein in 1939.|$|E

Krzyżanowski's father and both uncles had fought for Polish independence under Napoleon's banners, and his brother fought in the November 1830 Uprising.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe US military requires a reliable, high-speed, multimedia capable system to disseminate information that cannot be efficiently distributed over existing low data rate channels. The Global Broadcast Service (GBS) {{is being developed}} to meet this requirement. The cornerstones of the OBS simplex broadcast are the premises of smart push and user pull. An {{integral part of the}} user pull is the <b>reach</b> <b>back</b> channel. The <b>reach</b> <b>back</b> channel allows users to speciiy the information they need broadcast and tailor the information to meet their mission needs. Ultra high frequency (UHF) demand assigned multiple access (DAMA) satellite communications are the most widely available long haul communication systems available to members of the armed services and as such are a prime candidate to provide a <b>reach</b> <b>back</b> path for GES. In order to fully utilize UHF DAMA as a <b>reach</b> <b>back</b> channel for data communications a number of interface requirements must be met. The problems of using UHF DAMA are discussed and recommendations are made for the OBS Phase Two systems so they might support the use of UHF DAMA as a <b>reach</b> <b>back</b> channel. This thesis shows that UHF DAMA is a viable <b>reach</b> <b>back</b> channel, however there are factors which could improve the efficiency[URL] United States Air Forc...|$|R

25|$|Boas' student Edward Sapir <b>reached</b> <b>back</b> to the Humboldtian {{idea that}} {{languages}} contained {{the key to}} understanding the world views of peoples. He espoused the viewpoint that because of the differences in the grammatical systems of languages no two languages were similar enough to allow for perfect cross-translation. Sapir also thought because language represented reality differently, it followed that the speakers of different languages would perceive reality differently.|$|E
25|$|Together {{throughout}} the 1970s, Scott-Heron and Jackson made music {{that reflected the}} turbulence, uncertainty and increasing pessimism of the times, merging the soul and jazz traditions and drawing on an oral poetry tradition that <b>reached</b> <b>back</b> to the blues and forward to hip-hop. The music sounded by turns angry, defiant and regretful while Scott-Heron's lyrics possessed a satirical edge that set them apart from the militant soul of contemporaries such as Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield.|$|E

25|$|Relations {{with the}} Roman Catholic Church {{improved}} significantly during Mussolini's tenure. Despite earlier {{opposition to the}} Church, after 1922 Mussolini made an alliance with the pro-church Partito Popolare Italiano, or Italian People's Party. In 1929, Mussolini and the pope came to an agreement that ended a standoff that <b>reached</b> <b>back</b> to 1860 and had alienated the Church from the Italian government. The Orlando government had begun the process of reconciliation during World War I and the pope furthered it by cutting ties with the Christian Democrats in 1922. Mussolini and the leading Fascists were atheists, but they recognized the opportunity of warmer relations with Italy's large Roman Catholic element.|$|E

25|$|From {{the archaeological}} {{excavations}} in the 1970s, {{it is clear}} that construction took over most of the site of the earlier temple enclosure and that the Triportico and Rotunda roughly overlapped with the temple building itself; the excavations indicate that the temple extended at least {{as far back as the}} Aedicule, and the temple enclosure would have <b>reached</b> <b>back</b> slightly further. Virgilio Canio Corbo, a Franciscan priest and archaeologist, who was present at the excavations, estimated from the archaeological evidence that the western retaining wall, of the temple itself, would have passed extremely close to the east side of the supposed tomb; if the wall had been any further west any tomb would have been crushed under the weight of the wall (which would be immediately above it) if it had not already been destroyed when foundations for the wall were made.|$|E
25|$|The Latécoère 350, or 35-0 as it {{was first}} called, was a direct {{development}} of the successful single-engined passenger carrying Latécoère 28. To increase cruising speed and, in particular to provide reliability for night flying, the new design had three engines. Apart from the immediate changes this involved and a modest increase in wingspan, the 350 and the 28 had much in common, both in structural detail and in general appearance. Both were high wing, strut braced monoplanes with enclosed cockpits and fixed undercarriages. The two extra engines of the 350 were mounted {{at the ends of}} stub wings, more streamlined support structures than lifting surfaces, which extended horizontally from the lower fuselage longerons. Each was further stabilised by a pair of struts from {{the upper part of the}} engine mounting to the wing roots. The outer engines were mounted as close together as possible, to minimize the couple resulting from the loss of power of one of them. They were housed in long, well streamlined cowlings that <b>reached</b> <b>back</b> as far as the wing trailing edge. The third engine was in the nose, as in the Latécoère 28. All the engines were 400hp (298kW) Hispano-Suiza 12Jb V-12 twelve water-cooled units. Three separate radiators for them were fixed under the stub wing.|$|E

25|$|In 1983 Tenshin Reb Anderson {{received}} shihō from Zentatsu Richard Baker, becoming Baker's first Dharma heir (though Baker disputes this). From 1986 to 1988 {{he served}} as abbot of the San Francisco Zen Center, and from 1988 to 1995 he served there as co-abbot with Sojun Mel Weitsman. Anderson became entangled in an incident in 1987 that <b>reached</b> <b>back</b> to 1983— just after Zentatsu Richard Baker had resigned as abbot. While jogging through Golden Gate Park, Anderson deviated from the path to urinate in some bushes. There he found the corpse {{of a man with}} a bullet wound to the head and a revolver nearby. Rather than report this to the police, Anderson returned to the body over several days to meditate over the corpse. On one visit he decided to take the revolver home with him. Upon his final visit he found the body no longer there, and a fellow priest in whom he had confided showed him a newspaper article covering the apparent suicide. Five years later (in 1988), roughly fifteen months after Anderson had become abbot of the San Francisco, Anderson was arrested for brandishing this same firearm in public. He reported being mugged at knifepoint by a man just a block away from the San Francisco Zen Center at 300 Page Street. Anderson remembered stowing the revolver away in the San Francisco Zen Center's garage and quickly retrieved it. He then drove after the alleged mugger and followed him into a housing project with the revolver (unloaded) in hand, being arrested minutes later by a police officer with his own gun pointed at him.|$|E
