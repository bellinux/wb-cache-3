In 1848-49 he added a cupola to the dome and cut windows through the chancel vault. In 1849, the 17th century woodwork was sympathetically augmented and adapted by W. Gibbs Rogers.

40|$|AbstractIn this article, Ritz’s {{method is}} used to {{calculate}} with unprecedented accuracy the displacements related to a deformable rectangular <b>plate</b> <b>resting</b> on the surface of an elastic quarter-space. To achieve this required three basic steps. The first step involved the study of Green’s function describing the vertical displacements of the surface of an elastic quarter-space due to vertical force applied on its surface. For this case, an explicit formula was obtained by analytically resolving a complicated integral that did not previously have an analytical solution. The second step involved the study of the coupled system of a plate and an elastic quarter-space. This portion focused on determining reactive forces in the contact zone based on Hetenyi’s solution. After determination of the reactive forces, certain features were attributed to the plate’s edges. The final step involved the application of Ritz’s method to determine the deflections of the <b>plate</b> <b>resting</b> {{on the surface of the}} quarter-space. Finally, an example calculation and validation of results are given. This is the first semi-analytical solution proposed for this type of contact problem...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the free {{vibrations}} of simply supported rectangular <b>plates,</b> <b>resting</b> {{on two different}} models of soils, are considered. The first model called Het´enyi, {{by the name of}} the deviser, assumes a continuous plate, embedded in a Winkler-type soil to realize the foundation partial continuity. The upper <b>plate</b> <b>rests</b> on a multiple layer characterized by a Winkler-type soil, a continuous plate and another Winkler-type soil in sequence. The two Winkler-type soils have different modules. In the second model, the plate will be embedded in two layers of soils, whose behavior {{is similar to that of}} the Pasternak–Kerr-type soil. The two models have been already used for the study of the double beam system. The free motions, in both cases, are described by a homogeneous set of partial differential equations, based on Kirchhoff–Love theory. Next, the homogeneous equations of motion are solved by using the classical Navier method. The free frequencies and associated vibration mode shapes of double plate system are found and numerical examples are illustrated to compare the two models...|$|R
40|$|The {{transient}} response of a finite elastic <b>plate,</b> <b>resting</b> on an elastic half-space, {{and subjected to}} moving loads is considered here. Both the cases of an elastic foundation alone, {{as well as a}} finite sized elastic <b>plate</b> <b>resting</b> on an elastic foundation are considered. The numerical methods employed are: (1) the time-domain boundary element method for the elastic foundation and (2) a combination of the time-domain boundary element method for the soil and the semi-discrete finite element method for the finite sized elastic plate. Both constant as well as linear-time-interpolation schemes are included in the BEM. The integration is carried out analytically in time. The analytical solution for a moving point load on an infinite elastic <b>plate</b> <b>resting</b> on an elastic half-space is derived here. This is used as a benchmark against which the present numerical solution is compared with. The accuracy of the numerical method is also verified by comparing the solutions with some existing numerical results; the comparison with the solutions based on a Winkler foundation model reveals the limitations of the applicability of such a model, especially in the cases of high velocities of the moving load. This is because neither the inertia of the foundation, nor the behaviour of the foundation as a continuum, can be properly accounted for in Winkler’s model. A parametric study is conducted, and the influences of velocity of the moving load, load distribution, etc. on the dynamic response of the soil/runway system are investigated. Furthermore, the present computational method is applied to the problem of a transport airplane taxiing on a concrete pavement resting on a typical soil. The responses of pavements are presented for different taxiing velocities. KEY WORDS: moving load; runway; boundary element; finite element 1...|$|R

Dozens of hard white conical structures radiated from the surface.

Odontomas are classified as hamartomas and typically develop in imma-ture diphyodont mammals. The pharyngeal location and lifelong regeneration of teeth in fish, however, both qualify the present diagnosis in the pharyngeal region of an adult teleost.
