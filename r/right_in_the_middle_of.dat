5|$|As the 18 fireships {{prepared}} in Britain by Mulgrave {{had not yet}} departed {{by the time of}} Cochrane's arrival with the fleet, the captain responding by converting his own over the following week. A number of chasse-marées carrying tar and resin perfect for this role had been captured by the blockade, and Cochrane requisitioned eight military transport ships from the fleet reserve for conversion using these materials. The frigate-storeship HMS Mediator was taken over to be the centrepiece of the attack force. These vessels were laden with explosives and combustible materials such as rum-soaked hay, and crewed by volunteers from the fleet. On three of the vessels Cochrane had loaded 1,500 barrels of gunpowder, topped by hundreds of artillery shells and thousands of grenades to create an explosion ship, a floating bomb of his own design intended to detonate <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the French line. During this process an attack by French boats on the fireships was driven off, with two British sailors killed and one wounded, and on 5 April Cochrane reconnoitered the approaches to Aix Roads, firing shots at the forts and fleet to gauge their responses. He subsequently wrote to Mulgrave suggesting that with an expeditionary force of 20,000 he could seize the defences overlooking the anchorage, sink blockships in the channel and thereby permanently deprive the French of one of their most important naval bases, although his letter was ignored.|$|E

25|$|The town's {{main claim}} to fame is that it played a {{significant}} part in the World War II Normandy landings because this village stood <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> route N13, which the Germans would have most likely used on any significant counterattack on the troops landing on Utah and Omaha Beaches.

As well as walking picket lines daily, members endorsed incumbent Joe Canciamilla (now {{a member of the}} State Assembly) and newcomer Dana Hunt (a county sheriff and union member).

It has historical linkage to the visit of Emperor Lê Thánh Tông to the provincial city in 1468. The emperor was moved by {{the beauty of the}} mountain covered with clouds, called it a young fairy of Hạ Long and got a poem written on it and engraved on the southern side of the rocky cliff. In 1729, Lord Trịnh Cương did a painting and poem on Emperor Lê Thánh Tông on this mountain.|$|E

25|$|After the war, the {{fraternity}} was reconstituted at the University of Cologne in 1950 and soon fused with the smaller Corps Gothia Dresden in 1953. Originally located in Köln-Lindenthal, Altsachsen soon moved to Köln-Marienburg, where it stayed until the Iron Curtain collapsed. During the Soviet dictatorship in East Germany, fraternities abiding by free will and common consensus were again {{not allowed to}} exist as {{they could not be}} controlled by the Socialist Party. Following Germany's reunification in 1989, {{the fraternity}} returned to Dresden in 1994 with the aid of the Blaues Kartell, a circle of four like-minded fraternities that Altsachsen had joined in 1993. The Blaues Kartell today includes the Corps Saxo-Thuringia München in Munich, Corps Hannoverania in Hanover and Corps Berlin in Berlin. In 1997, the Corps Altsachsen transitioned its headquarters to its newly remodeled fraternity house on Weissbachstreet 1, <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the Campus of the Dresden University of Technology, thereby reconnecting with its traditional roots.|$|E
25|$|Before Richelieu's {{ascent to}} power, most of Europe had become enmeshed in the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648). France was not openly {{at war with}} the Habsburgs, who ruled Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, so {{subsidies}} and aid were provided secretly to their adversaries. He considered the Dutch Republic as one of France's most important allies, for it bordered directly with the Spanish Netherlands and was <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the Eighty Years War with Spain at that time. Luckily for him, Richelieu was a bon français, just like the king, who had already decided to subsidize the Dutch to fight against the Spanish via the Treaty of Compiègne in June 1624, prior to Richelieu's appointment to Prime minister in August. That same year, a military expedition, secretly financed by France and commanded by Marquis de Coeuvres, started an action with the intention of liberating the Valtelline from Spanish occupation. In 1625 Richelieu also sent money to Ernst von Mansfeld, a famous mercenary general operating in Germany in English service. However, in May 1626, when war costs had almost ruined France, king and cardinal made peace with Spain via the Treaty of Monçon. This peace quickly broke down after tensions due to the War of Mantuan Succession.|$|E
25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right out of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E

[...] Melton explained that, [...] "He has a lot of ideas, but it's a bit hard and extreme to implement all of these ideas because sets have been built, people have been cast, props have been bought or created, and with the Saw films they are so specific in set design because of the traps.

500|$|Forty-five drivers {{attempted}} to qualify; due to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race.

500|$|Fischer (1997) {{published}} {{new line}} drawings. These include lines scored with obsidian but not {{finished with a}} shark tooth, which had not been recorded by Barthel because the rubbings he used often did not show them, for example on tablet N. (However, in line Gv4 shown in the section on writing instruments above, the light lines were recorded by both Fischer and Barthel.) There are other omissions in Barthel which Fischer corrects, such as a sequence of glyphs at the transition from line Ca6 to Ca7 which is missing from Barthel, presumably because the carving went {{over the side of}} the tablet and was missed by Barthel's rubbing. (This missing sequence is <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> Barthel's calendar.) However, other discrepancies between the two records are straightforward contradictions. For instance, the initial glyph of I12 (line 12 of the Santiago Staff) in Fischer does not correspond with that of Barthel or Philippi, which agree with each other, and Barthel's rubbing (below) is incompatible with Fischer's drawing. Barthel's annotation, Original doch 53.76! ("original indeed 53.76!"), suggests that he specifically verified Philippi's reading: ...|$|E
