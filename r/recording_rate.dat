40|$|ABSTRACT Data from inbred lines, one (D) {{selected}} for part <b>record</b> <b>rate</b> of lay {{and the other}} (C) un{{selected for}} any trait, were analyzed. After 19 generations of continuous full sib matings, the C line showed significant decreases in part record egg number, 32 -week egg weight, shell thickness, full record egg number and part <b>record</b> <b>rate</b> of lay but nonsignificant decreases in hatchability, full <b>record</b> <b>rate</b> of lay, and laying house mortality. Age at first egg, Haugh unit and mature body weight showed significant increases in this line. The D line {{was similar to the}} C line in its response to the same intensity of inbreeding for all traits except full record egg number, part <b>record</b> <b>rate,</b> and fertility, each of which showed a significant decrease, and Haugh unit and full <b>record</b> <b>rate</b> of lay, which showed nonsignificant increases. Results indicated that the small advantages selection conferred on the inbred line in part <b>record</b> <b>rate</b> of lay (the selection criterion), full record egg number, and full <b>record</b> <b>rate</b> of lay were ac-companied by undesirable changes in other traits, resulting in later sexual maturity, larger body weight, lower Haugh unit, fertility, and hatchability compared with the unselected line...|$|R

40|$|Objective. EULAR {{recommendations}} for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk management include annual CVD risk assessments {{for patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We evaluated the recording of CVD risk factors (CVD-RF) in a rheumatology outpatient clinic, where EULAR recommendations had been implemented. Further, we compared CVD-RF recordings between a regular rheumatology outpatient clinic (RegROC) and a structured arthritis clinic (AC). Methods. In 2012, 1142 RA patients visited the rheumatology outpatient clinic: 612 attended RegROC and 530 attended AC. We conducted a search in the patient journals to ascertain the rate of CVD-RF recording. Results. The overall CVD-RF <b>recording</b> <b>rate</b> was 40. 1 % in the rheumatology outpatient clinic, reflecting a <b>recording</b> <b>rate</b> of 59. 1 % in the AC and 23. 6 % in the RegROC.

40|$|This paper {{finds that}} the {{national}} decline in robbery and theft offences {{is partly due to}} a reduction in heroin use and partly due to improvements in the economy, but that other factors are likely to have also played a role. Aim: To describe and discuss inter-jurisdictional trends in police-recorded robbery and theft offences. Method: <b>Rates</b> of <b>recorded</b> robbery and theft per head of population are calculated for each Australian jurisdiction from 1994 / 1995 to 2012. <b>Rates</b> of <b>recorded</b> robbery are disaggregated into armed and unarmed robbery. <b>Rates</b> of <b>recorded</b> theft are disaggregated into burglary, motor vehicle theft and other theft. Results: In most jurisdictions, trends in recorded robbery and theft offences rose during the late 1990 s, peaked around 2001 and then fell from 2001 to 2012. Between 2001 and 2009, <b>recorded</b> <b>rates</b> of robbery offences in Australia fell by 49. 1 per cent, <b>recorded</b> <b>rates</b> of burglary fell by 57. 3 per cent, <b>recorded</b> <b>rates</b> of motor vehicle theft fell by 62. 2 per cent and <b>recorded</b> <b>rates</b> of other theft fell by 39. 3 per cent. Conclusion: The national decline in robbery and theft offences is partly due to a reduction in heroin use and partly due to improvements in the economy but other factors are likely to have also played a role. Research into the causes of the fall in crime is hampered by the absence of any regional breakdown in national recorded crime statistics...|$|R

40|$|The X-ray {{transient}} MAXI J 1836 - 194 is a newly identified Galactic {{black hole}} binary candidate. As most X-ray transients, {{it was discovered}} {{at the beginning of}} an X-ray outburst. After the initial canonical X-ray hard state, the outburst evolved into a hard intermediate state and then went back to the hard state. The existing RATAN- 600 radio monitoring observations revealed that it was variable on a time-scale of days and had a flat or inverted spectrum, consistent with optically thick synchrotron emission, possibly from a self-absorbed jet {{in the vicinity of the}} central compact object. We observed the transient in the hard state near the end of the X-ray outburst with the European very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) Network (EVN) at 5 GHz and the Chinese VLBI Network (CVN) at 2. 3 and 8. 3 GHz.
