25|$|Trigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack) — Trigger, {{apparently}} {{so called}} because {{he looks like}} a horse, was the principal supporting character earlier in the show's run, although his importance lessened as the series progressed. Lloyd Pack was cast by pure chance: Ray Butt, who hired him to portray Trigger after seeing him in a stage play, had only attended that play to observe potential Del Boy actor Billy Murray. A daft <b>road</b> <b>sweeper</b> most frequently seen in the Nag's Head, Trigger was initially portrayed as a small-time thief, supplying Del with dubious goods. In later episodes he came to adopt the 'village idiot' role, and believes that Rodney's real name is Dave.|$|E

25|$|The Plumed Serpent, an {{ideogram}} of {{the metaphor}} of Quetzalcoatl, alludes {{to one of the}} most powerful forces of nature. A Said metaphor is recorded in the Nahuatl language:Quetzalcoatl: he was the wind; he was the guide, the <b>road</b> <b>sweeper</b> of the rain gods, of the masters of the water, of those who Brough rain. And when the wind increased, it was said, the dust swirled up, it roared, howled, became dark, blew in all directions; there was lightning; it grew wrathful.The metaphor served to not only describe a powerful seasonal phenomenon, but was also the title of rulership and priestly office; additionally, the name figured in Toltec ties as a military title and emblem.|$|E

In 1979 during an amateur {{game with a}} local side, the 200 Club, in Kirkintilloch, McAvennie, playing well, came to the {{attention}} of local scouts. He was recommended to local junior side Johnstone Burgh signing for them for a £500 fee. He completed a trial for Partick Thistle playing in a single game where he was sent on as a substitute only to be substituted off in the same game and be told by manager Bertie Auld that he would never make a career in the game of football. Before turning professional, he had joined the Territorial Army and later had trials with the British Army but was not accepted for a role with them due to his inability to hit the target during shooting practices. He also had a spell working as a <b>road</b> <b>sweeper.</b> He did not move into professional football until he joined St Mirren in 1980, at the age of 20. His league debut came in the 1981-82 season in a 4-3 defeat of Airdrieonians. Playing as a midfielder, McAvennie scored two goals. In 1982, he was named Scottish PFA Young Player of the Year. [...] He would make 135 league appearances for them over the next five years, scoring 48 goals.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{treating}} people equally is not {{by itself}} enough to achieve equality for everyone, the law requires that employers owe positive duties to disabled people to give preferential treatment. According to Chacón Navas v Eurest Colectividades SA disabilities involve an impairment [...] "which hinders {{the participation of the}} person concerned in professional life". This includes all varieties of mental and physical disabilities. Because treating disabled people equally based on ability to perform tasks could easily result in persistence of exclusion from the workforce, employers are bound to do as much as reasonably possible to ensure participation is not hindered in practice. Under the Equality Act 2010 sections 20 to 22, employers have to make [...] "reasonable adjustments". For example, employers may have to change physical features of a workplace, or provide auxiliary aids to work, or adjust their working habits and expectations. In effect, the law views society as being the cause of the [...] "disability" [...] if it fails to ensure people are accommodated, rather than seeing the person's handicap as being merely a personal misfortune. EA 2010 Schedule 8 lists more examples of reasonable adjustments, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission provides guidance. In the leading case, Archibald v Fife Council, it was held that the council had a duty to exempt a lady from competitive interviews for a new job. Mrs Archibald, previously a <b>road</b> <b>sweeper,</b> had lost the ability to walk after complications in surgery. Despite over 100 applications for grades just above a manual worker, in her submission, the employers were fixated on her past history as a sweeper. The House of Lords held it could be appropriate, before such an ordeal, for a worker to fill an existing vacancy without a standard interview procedure. By contrast, in O’Hanlon v Revenue and Customs Commissioners the Court of Appeal rejected {{that it would be a}} reasonable adjustment, as Ms O'Hanlon was requesting after falling into clinical depression, for an employer to increase sick pay to full pay, after the expiry of a six-month period that applied to everyone else. The aim is always to ensure that disabilities are not a barrier to full participation in working life, as much as possible.|$|E
50|$|Since 2008, {{thousands}} of British Pakistani graduates in Britain {{have been forced}} to work for low wages due to the rising unemployment and recession in the country.

More than 20,000 British Pakistani students who graduated in 2012 were still without jobs six months after graduating. Moreover, an increasing number of university graduates are opting for low-paying minimum wage positions. In 2011 alone, some 10,270 graduates found work as labourers, couriers, office juniors, hospital porters, waiters, bar staff, cleaners, <b>road</b> <b>sweepers</b> and school dinner servers.

40|$|Forty paired road {{dust and}} gully sediments {{from the city}} of Sheffield in NE England show that high platinum, {{palladium}} and rhodium concentrations derived from catalytic converters depend on proximity to both roundabouts rather than traffic lights and to topographic lows. Road dust outside schools and control samples, further away on the same road, show that Pt, Pd and Rh concentrations are dependant on passing traffic flow rather than numbers of stopping vehicles. Highest values of Pt + Pd in road dust are 852 ppb and 694 ppb in gullies. Rh has maximum values of 113 ppb in road dust and 49 ppb in gullies. Pt and Pd values of a few ppb to just over 100 ppb occur in road dust where traffic does not stop, on roads away from junctions. Pt, Pd, Rh and Au are all picked up by <b>road</b> <b>sweepers</b> and gully flushers both with maximum values of just over 100 ppb Pt and Pd. High Au values (maximum 610 ppb in a road dust) were located on pavements, in suburbs, outside schools and in <b>road</b> <b>sweepers</b> collecting in residential areas rather than on high traffic flow roads. Stratification of Pt and Pd in gullies was not observed whereas a high Au value was recorded {{at the bottom of a}} gully suggesting gravity concentration for Au. Anomalous Pd grades of 1050 ppb in road dust from a school entrance and 2040 ppb in a street sweeper sample were recorded. These high Pd- and Au-bearing samples do not have anomalous Pt or Rh values and may be sourced from jewellery or dental fillings. However, most samples have consistent Pt/Pd ratios of about 1 and Pt/Rh values of 4 to 5 indicating a catalytic converter source. Pt and Pd are concentrated in road dust at levels well above background in all the samples, including on high and low traffic flow roads...|$|R

40|$|Platinum (Pt) and Palladium (Pd) {{concentrations}} {{have been}} analysed in 194 samples {{from within the}} city of Sheffield in the UK. The samples were taken from road dust, gully pots (also known as drains), soils, a motorway drainage pipe, rivers, lakes, sewage sludge, incinerator ash, incinerator ash in landfill, street cleansers and gully cleansers. The introduction of Pt- and Pd-bearing automobile catalysts, has been cited {{as the cause of}} a rise in the concentration of urban Pt and Pd accumulations. Geochemical analyses for the different sample types are used here to show how the Pt and Pd accumulate in different urban environments as they are transported from their catalytic source. Initially Pt and Pd collect in road dust and gully pots at values of up to 450 ppb although most analyses for both elements are around 100 ppb. The four roadside soils analysed, have a great range in values, the highest with a value of over 600 ppb Pt and 1000 ppb Pd. Then the fate of the Pt and Pd is either to be removed by gully flushers and <b>road</b> <b>sweepers</b> (which contain around half the concentration of that in road dust) or to be washed from the roads, through the gully pots, into either the river or urban drainage systems. Due to the addition of terrestrial sediments, river samples contain much reduced values of Pt and Pd, at approximately an order of magnitude lower than in road dust. Similarly, sewage sludge contains Pt and Pd values which are lower than road dust. However, the Pt and Pd analyses are much higher in incinerated sewage (with many samples over 150 ppb for both metals), probably due to the loss of the mass of other material during the incineration process. Weathered incinerator ash in landfill has lower values of Pt and Pd than fresh ash from the incinerator. Although the range in values of Pt and Pd is similar for road dust and gully pot sediments their modal values tell a different story. The mode for Pt is very similar for both road dust and gully pot sediments, at around 100 ppb, whereas there is a drop of 50 ppb in the mode for Pd in the gully pots (from 80 ppb to around 40 ppb). Given that gully pot sediment is derived from road dust, it is suggested that in gully pots, Pd is preferentially mobilized over Pt. Furthermore, a comparison of the modal values of Pt and Pd in river sediments suggests that this process continues into the natural drainage system of the city...|$|R
