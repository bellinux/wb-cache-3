5|$|Leaving Beaver Township, {{the creek}} enters Main Township. It {{continues}} following Catawissa Mountain, and, for a shorter distance, Full Mill Hill. It picks up Gap Run and Fisher <b>Run</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left, Scotch <b>Run</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> right, and Furnace <b>Run</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left in quick succession. After picking up Furnace Run, Catawissa Creek flows between Catawissa Mountain and Nescopeck Mountain in a high, narrow gorge. As the creek leaves the gorge, it passes Mainville and enters a plain. The creek turns west-southwest and the plain narrows slightly. On {{the south side}} of the plain is Catawissa Mountain and on the north side are lower hills. After a few miles, the creek flows out of Main Township and into Catawissa Township. In Catawissa Township, the creek flows southwest to Catawissa. It follows the southern border of Catawissa until it reaches its edge and turns northwards, following the western border of Catawissa. Pennsylvania Route 487 crosses over the creek at this point. At the western edge of Catawissa, the creek empties into the Susquehanna River.|$|E

5|$|The NorthSouth Freeway {{portion of}} Route 42 was {{originally}} planned as a parkway in 1932 that would <b>run</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ben Franklin Bridge in Camden to Atlantic City; however, this proposal never materialized. In the late 1940s, the NorthSouth Freeway was {{proposed by the}} New Jersey State Highway Department to <b>run</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ben Franklin Bridge to Turnersville. In the early 1950s, right-of-way for the freeway was acquired and actual construction of the freeway followed. The Route 42 freeway opened between Interstate 295 in Bellmawr and the Black Horse Pike in Blackwood in 1958. It opened between the Black Horse Pike in Blackwood and Turnersville in 1959. With {{the completion of the}} NorthSouth Freeway portion of Route 42, the Black Horse Pike north of Turnersville became Route 168.|$|E
5|$|The present-day routing of Route 20 {{north of}} Market Street was legislated in 1927 {{as part of}} Route 3, which was to <b>run</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> New York border at Greenwood Lake to Secaucus.

In 1929, the western {{terminus}} of Route 3 was moved to Paterson as Route S4B (now Route 208) was planned to replace the alignment of Route 3 from Paterson to the New York border. McLean Boulevard through Paterson was built by the 1930s. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 20 was legislated to follow the former alignment of Route 3 between Paterson and East Rutherford as Route 3 was moved to the Route S3 freeway that was built between East Rutherford and Clifton.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} two-track {{connection is}} planned between the line toward Lower Manhattan (around 63rd Street) and the IND 63rd Street Line toward Queens using existing bellmouths {{that are at}} 63rd Street and First Avenue. Current plans do not call {{for it to be}} used by regular service, but instead to be used for non-revenue moves and to provide a connection to the Jamaica subway yard. The connection would allow for trains to <b>run</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Financial District to Queens if the capacity of the IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Bypass was built. Service from Queens via the 63rd Street Tunnel would allow for the full capacity of the line south of 63rd Street to be used. Plans include provisions for an extension north under Second Avenue past 125th Street to the Bronx, and an extension south to Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of his}} {{strategy}} {{for dealing with the}} Marcher Lords, Llywelyn married his eldest son, Dafydd, to Isabella, the daughter of William de Braose, a powerful lord in Brecon, Builth and Abergavenny. The Marcher Lords had adopted a style of stone castle that included circular keeps and an integrated system of curtain walls. Following Dafydd's marriage, Llywelyn appears to have started a second phase of building at Dolbadarn, probably in the 1240s, adding these elements to the existing castle. The prince was probably aiming not only to incorporate the latest military technology, but also to create a castle of equal prestige to those of his new allies in the south. Traditionally the surrounding district of Is Gwyrfai had been <b>run</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> town of Llanbeblig; after the 1240s, this role was transferred to Dolbadarn.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Healy took one catch to dismiss Danielle Hazell from the bowling of Sthalekar.

Three wickets had fallen {{in the space of}} 16 balls, during which only three runs had been added, and England had the momentum, and 42 runs were needed from 34 balls for victory. Healy then struck three fours, making 15 from 9 balls before being dismissed by Nicki Shaw, ending a stand of 23 from 13 balls with Sthalekar. However, Rene Farrell was run out going for the winning <b>run</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E
