Both pincer complexes possess pseudo-trigonal bipyramidal geometry with the coordinating pincer P atoms in equatorial sites and the pincer C atom in an axial site. A route to these pincer complexes has been discovered which involves a rearrangement with loss of PMe 3 from the cyclometallated complex [Co{ 2 -(CH 2 PPh 2 -KP) - 4 -(CH 2 PPh 2) C 6 H 3 -K[1 }(PMe 3) 3]. The mechanism for this rearrangement has been probed by both kinetic studies and deuterium-labelling studies, which suggests that two mechanisms operate, one of which involves a series of intramolecular C-H oxidative additions and <b>reductive</b> <b>eliminations</b> to effectively 'shuttle' protons around the complex.

Proof links allow proofs to reference proofs thus giving proof schemata a recursive structure. Unfortunately, applying <b>reductive</b> cut- <b>elimination</b> is non-trivial {{in the presence of}} proof links. Borrowing the concept of lazy instantiation from functional programming, we evaluate proof links locally allowing reductive cut-elimination to proceed past them. Though, this method cannot be used to obtain cut-free proof schemata, we nonetheless obtain important results concerning the schematic CERES method, that is a method of cut-elimination for proof schemata based on resolution. In "Towards a clausal analysis of cut-elimination", it was shown that reductive cut-elimination transforms a given LK-proof {{in such a way that}} a subsumption relation holds between the pre- and post-transformation characteristic clause sets, i. e. the clause set representing the cut-structure of an LK-proof. Let CL(A') be the characteristic clause set of a normal form A' of an LK-proof A that is reached by performing reductive cut-elimination on A without atomic cut elimination. Then CL(A') is subsumed by all characteristic clause sets extractable from any application of reductive cut-elimination to A. Such a normal form is referred to as an ACNF top and plays an essential role in methods of cut-elimination by resolution. These results can be extended to proof schemata through our "lazy instantiation" of proof links, and provides an essential step toward a complete cut-elimination method for proof schemata.

40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this thesis is on the {{mechanism}} of olefin metathesis and ring opening metathesis polymerizations. In addition, several reactions of metal alkylidenes and metallacycles which are not traditionally viewed {{as part of the}} olefin metathesis reaction are presented. Olefin metathesis involves the 2 + 2 cycloaddition of metal alkylidenes with olefins and the 2 + 2 cycloreversion of metallacyclobutanes. These reactions are becoming common place in organometallic reaction mechanisms and join the traditional oxidative additions, <b>reductive</b> <b>eliminations,</b> ligand substitutions, intramolecular insertions, nucleophilic attacks on coordinated ligands and ligand fluxtionalities as the commonly sited organometallic reactions. A current goal of organometallic chemistry is to understand the influence of oxidation state, electron count, ligand sterics, ligand electronics and substituent effects upon each of these reactions. The knowledge of mechanisms is essential to be able to understand and rationally manipulate chemical processes. The knowledge also allows for the capability to catagorize mechanistic theories as an organizing device for understanding organometallic chemistry as a whole. Organometallic chemistry, however, is not easily catagorized due to the large complexity of bonding types and structures that inorganic chemistry produces. The work in this thesis has utilized some techniques of physical organic chemistry to study mechanisms and reactive intermediates. These techniques include kinetics, substituent effects, isotope effects, stereochemical studies and theoretical calculations. Organic chemistry has greatly benefited from the advent and subsequent development of the pericyclic theory for the understanding of covalent bonding, frontier orbitals and symmetry. These same notions have met with various levels of success in organometallic chemistry. The success of theoretical studies in organometallic systems very often depends upon the level of electron correlation {{and the extent to which}} the exchange integrals are calculated. The theory presented in this thesis utilizes a fully ab initio method with electron correlation. The structure of organometallic complexes is examined as a function of the nodal planes of the individual metal ligand bonds and their influence on the bonding of other ligands within the same complex. In addition, reactivity of the complexes are probed as a function of the symmetry and energy of the bonding and empty orbitals. In chapter one, data and speculations relating to the mechanism of cleavage of titanocene metallacyclobutanes is presented. The reactive intermediate is postulated to be a titanocene methylidene-olefin adduct. Chapter two further expands upon these mechanistic studies by presenting the kinetics and polydispersities of the ring opening metathesis polymerizations of slightly strained olefins. Chapter three presents work which utilizes ab initio electronic structure theory calculations to determine the energetics of the 2 + 2 cycloaddition of molybdenum alkylidene and imido complexes with olefins. In chapters 4, 5 and 6, reactivity different than the normal cycloadditions of metal alkylidenes and cycloreversions of metallacycles is examined. In chapter 4, an electron transfer mechanism for the reaction of titanocene methylidene with activated halides is presented. Chapter 5 discusses the reactivity of titanocene methylidene with inorganic carbonyls. The titanocene methylidene does not perform methylene transfer as is seen with organic carbonyls, but instead, the resultant oxametallacycle rearranges to yield a titanocene ketene complex. Finally, in chapter six, ab initio electronic structure theory calculations are again presented. They are used to explore the interconversion of a metallacyclobutadiene to a metallatetrahedrane. The two complexes are found to be energetically similar due to a balance between the strength of σ and π bonds and the role of strain and resonance effects. Each chapter was written as an individual study and thus includes an Abstract, Introduction, Results and Discussion section and a Summary or Conclusion. Thus, this thesis presents work that attempts to add a little more knowledge to the mechanistic and theoretical understanding of organometallic reaction mechanisms. ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1941, Kharash {{discovered}} that Grignard reagents add to cyclohexenone in presence of Cu(I) resulting in 1,4-addition instead of 1,2-addition. [...] This work foreshadowed extensive {{studies on the}} conjugate additions to enones with organocuprates. Note that if a Grignard reagent (such as RMgBr) is used, the reaction with an enone would instead proceed through a 1,2-addition. The 1,4-addition mechanism of cuprates to enones goes through the nucleophilic addition of the Cu(I) species at the beta-carbon of the alkene to form a Cu(III) intermediate, followed by <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> of Cu(I). In the original paper describing this reaction, methylmagnesium bromide is reacted with isophorone with and without 1 mole percent of added copper(I) chloride (see figure).|$|E

For <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> to occur the two groups (X and Y) should be mutually adjacent on the metal's coordination sphere. <b>Reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> is the key product-releasing step of several reactions that form C-H and C-C bonds.|$|E

There are several known mechanisms for <b>reductive</b> <b>elimination</b> from square planar d8 complexes.

40|$|Nitrochemicals are {{currently}} widely used as solvents, drugs, biocides, fuels and explosives and are consequently widely {{distributed in the}} environment. The <b>reductive</b> nitrite <b>elimination</b> from explosive compounds is catalyzed by two FMN-dependent, xenobiotic reductases (XenA or XenB). These genes for these regiospecific enzymes were cloned from Pseudomonas putida and P. fluorescens I-C respectively and isolated from the soil of a contaminated World War II munitions manufacturing plant. These enzymes enable the microbes to fulfill their nitrogen requirements from nitroglycerin by catalyzing the regiospecific, NADPH dependent, reductive denitration of nitroglycerin with differing selectivities. The two enzymes also transform a number of additional nitrocompounds in vitro, e. g. TNT and metronidazole, a leading drug {{in the treatment of}} Helicobacter pylori, a causative agent of human ulcers. Single crystals were obtained for XenA and XenB and complete X-ray diffraction datasets have been collected and analyzed to better understand these characteristics. The 1. 6 Å resolution structure of XenA reveals a dimer of β/α) ₈-TIM barrels, but the 2. 3 Å resolution structure for XenB is a monomer. The (β/α) ₈-TIM barrel protein fold is the most common fold in the PDB. However, the XenA structure exhibits a unique, C-terminal domain-swapped topology. Thus a portion of each active site is comprised of residues from the neighboring monomer. To probe the reaction cycle, crystal structures of ligand complexes and the reduced enzyme have been refined. For example, our structure of the XenA-metronidazole complex shows that ligands bind parallel to the FMN si-face. Our 1. 5 Å resolution structure for reduced XenA reveals an FMN isoalloxazine ring with an angle of ~ 165 ° along the N 5 -N 10 axis. We have also generated models of the reduced enzyme-nitroglycerin complexes by molecular dynamics. The results with both XenA and XenB reveal differences in enzyme-ligand hydrogen bonding. These differences correlate remarkably well with the regiospecific differences observed for nitrite elimination from nitroglycerin and reduction of TNT by the two enzymes. Ph. D.

In the case of 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2 and C 6 H 3 - 6 -F- 2 -PPh 2, the dihalodigold(II) complexes rearrange on heating to isomeric gold(I) –gold(III) complexes [XAuI(μ-P,C-carbanion) (κ 2 -P,C-carbanion) AuIIIX] (carbanion = 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2, X = Cl 25, Br 26, I 27; carbanion = C 6 H 3 - 6 -F- 2 -PPh 2, X = Cl 28, Br 29, I 30), in {{which one of the}} carbanions chelates to the gold(III) atom. This isomerisation is similar to, but occurs more slowly than, that in the corresponding C 6 H 3 - 6 -Me- 2 -PPh 2 system. The Au 2 X 2 complexes 6, 9 and 12, on the other hand, rearrange on heating via C–C coupling to give digold(I) complexes of the corresponding 2, 2 ′-biphenyldiylbis(diphenylphosphine), [Au 2 X 2 (2, 2 ′-Ph 2 P- 5 -F-C 6 H 3 C 6 H 3 - 5 -F-PPh 2) ] (X = Cl 32, Br 33, I 34), this behaviour resembling that of the 2 -C 6 H 4 PPh 2 and C 6 H 3 - 5 -Me- 2 -PPh 2 systems. Since the C–C coupling probably occurs via undetected gold(I) –gold(III) intermediates, the presence of a 6 -fluoro substituent is evidently sufficient to suppress the <b>reductive</b> <b>eliminations,</b> possibly because of an electronic effect that strengthens the gold(III) -aryl bond. Anation of 5 or 8 gives the bis(oxyanion) digold(II) complexes [Au 2 Y 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] (Y = OAc 14, ONO 215, OBz 16, O 2 CCF 317 and OTf 20), which do not isomerise to the corresponding gold(I) –gold(III) complexes [YAu(μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuY] on heating, though the latter [Y = OAc 35, ONO 236, OBz 37, O 2 CCF 338] can be made by anation of 25 – 27. Reaction of the bis(benzoato) digold(II) complex 16 with dimethylzinc gives a dimethyl gold(I) –gold(III) complex, [AuI(μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2 AuIII(CH 3) 2] 19, in which both 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2 groups are bridging. In contrast, the corresponding reaction of 16 with C 6 F 5 Li gives a digold(II) complex [AuII 2 (C 6 F 5) 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] 18, which on heating isomerises to a gold(I) –gold(III) complex, [(C 6 F 5) AuI(μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuIII(C 6 F 5) ] 31, analogous to 25 – 27. The bis(triflato) digold(II) complex 20 is reduced by methanol or cyclohexanol in CH 2 Cl 2 to a tetranuclear gold(I) complex [Au 4 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 4] 21 in which the four carbanions bridge a square array of metal atoms, as shown by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study. The corresponding tetramers [Au 4 (μ-C 6 H 3 -n-F- 2 -PPh 2) 4] (n = 5 22, 6 23) are formed as minor by-products in the preparation of dimers 3 and 4; the tetramers do not interconvert readily with, and are not in equilibrium with, the corresponding dimers 2 – 4. Addition of an excess of chlorine or bromine (X 2) to the digold(II) complexes 5 and 8, and to their gold(I) –gold(III) isomers 25 and 26, gives isomeric digold(III) complexes [Au 2 X 4 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] (X = Cl 39, Br 40) and [X 3 Au(μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuX(κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) ] (X = Cl 41, Br 42), respectively. The structures of the digold(I) complexes 2, 4 and 32, the digold(II) complexes 5 – 11 and 14 – 18, the gold(I) –gold(III) complexes 19, 25, 35 and 38, the tetragold(I) complexes 21 and 22, and the digold(III) complexes 41 and 42, have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In the digold(II) (5 d 9 – 5 d 9) series, there is a systematic lengthening, and presumably weakening, of the Au–Au distance in the range 2. 5012 (4) – 2. 5885 (2) Å with increasing trans-influence of the axial ligand, in the order X = ONO 2 < O 2 CCF 3 < OBz < Cl < Br < I < C 6 F 5. The strength of the Au–Au interaction is probably the main factor that determines whether the digold(II) compounds isomerise to gold(I) –gold(III). The gold-gold separations in the digold(I) and gold(I) –gold(III) complexes are in the range 2. 8 – 3. 6 Å suggestive of aurophilic interactions, but these are probably absent in the digold(III) compounds (AuAu separation ca. 5. 8 Å). Attempted recrystallisation of complex 10 gave a trinuclear gold(II) –gold(II) –gold(I) complex, [Au 3 Br 2 (μ-C 6 H 3 - 6 -F- 2 -PPh 2) 3] 24, which consists of the expected digold(II) framework in which one of the axial bromide ligands {{has been replaced by a}} σ-carbon bonded (C 6 H 3 - 6 -F- 2 -PPh 2) AuIBr fragment...|$|R
