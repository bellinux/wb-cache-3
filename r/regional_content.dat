5|$|After John Myers' {{recommendations}} of a regulatory overhaul in commercial radio were published, and the Digital Economy Act 2010 allowing stations to co-locate or discontinue local shows and to broadcast on national DAB was passed, Smooth Radio merged its five English stations into one quasi-national station, and local news feeds were produced from GMG Radio's headquarters in Salford Quays. GMG Radio announced on 29 June 2010 that {{it wanted to}} compete with BBC Radio 2 by broadcasting on the Digital One multiplex on DAB to the whole of England and Wales, and Sky, Freesat, Freeview, Virgin Media and online. <b>Regional</b> <b>content</b> would be kept; split news, travel and weather bulletins would be broadcast on the FM and regional DAB stations in the North East, North West, West Midlands and East Midlands. Listeners in London and those tuning to the national output would hear national information. 105.2 Smooth Radio in Scotland would keep its local breakfast and drivetime programmes because of the rules governing its broadcast licence, but networked content would be broadcast {{the rest of the}} time. The jazz commitments for London and the North West were also ended. The new Smooth Radio was launched on 4 October 2010 with most of the output originating from Salford Quays, and other programming coming from London.|$|E
5|$|Global {{announced}} on 12 August 2013 that Real and Smooth would relocate their London and West Midlands offices to Global premises. Smooth Radio's output was relocated to Global's Leicester Square headquarters from 1 October, {{a move that}} coincided with a major overhaul of its schedule, and the closure of Smooth 70s after 21 months on air. On 4 February 2014, the Radio Today website reported that Ofcom had given Global Radio permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform, and {{to replace it with}} a service playing music from the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Under this agreement, Smooth would continue to broadcast on its regional frequencies, but would be required to provide seven hours of local output per day. On 6 February, Global confirmed the sale of eight of its regional stationsincluding those with the Smooth Radio brand in the North West, North East and East Midlandsto the Irish media holdings company Communicorp. Under a franchising agreement between the two firms, these stations would retain the Smooth Radio name, but relaunch airing a mixture of both <b>regional</b> <b>content</b> and networked programming from London. Smooth would also take over Gold's medium wave frequencies, except in London, Manchester and the East Midlands. Global announced later that month that Smooth would be relaunched from 3 March, and subsequently confirmed the Gold changes would take effect from 24 March, when the stations would begin simulcasting with Smooth Radio London. This also coincided with the return of local programming at breakfast and drivetime.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of the study was}} to {{identify}} the types of catecholamines and the associated receptors which might be involved in the recall of the conditioned NK cell response. Specific catecholamine receptor antagonists were selected to block the conditioned NK cell response at the recall step. The <b>regional</b> <b>contents</b> of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine were determined in the brain of the conditioned animals by using the high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC/ED). Results showed that pre-disruption of the central alpha 1 -, alpha 2 -, beta 1 -, beta 2 -, D 1 -, or D 2 -receptors at the conditioned recall stage, interrupted the conditioned enhancement in NK cell activity. The NE contents at the cerebellum, and DA contents at the striatum and hippocampus, were significantly higher in the brain of the conditioned animals when compared to that of the control animals. These information indicated the possible roles of the central noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in regulating the recall of the conditioned NK cell response. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Opioid {{peptides}} {{derived from}} prodynorphin were localized immunocytochemically to dentate granule cells and mossy fibers {{of the rat}} hippocampus with antisera against dynorphin A(l- 17) and dynorphin 6. Extracts of microdissected hippocampal regions were resolved by reverse phase and molecular exclusion chromatography to identify the molecular forms of the dynorphin A immunoreactivity and to quantify <b>regional</b> <b>contents.</b> Results demonstrated that the relative concentration of dynorphin A within each dissected region of hippocampus agreed well with the distribution of dynorphin A detected by immunocytochemical methods. Immunostaining of proenkephalin-derived opioid peptides, [Leu 5]enkephalin and bovine adrenal medullary peptide- 22 P, was concentrated in cell bodies of the entorhinal cortex, nerve fibers in the perforant pathway, and terminals in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Light immunostaining of granule cells and mossy fibers with these antisera was also found. The relative concentration of [Leu’lenkephalin immunoreactivity in each microdissected region of the hippocampus also agreed well with the distribution of [Leu 5]enkephalin immunostaining. Chromatography of hippocampal regional extracts demonstrated that the immunoreactivity measured {{was due to the}} presence of authentic [Leu 5]enkephalin. The probable neurotransmitter function of both [Leu’lenkephalin and dynorphin A was shown by their calcium-dependent release after in vitro depolarization of hippocampal tissue.
