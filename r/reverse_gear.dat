5|$|Joseph Locke, driving Rocket, now {{saw that}} there were people on the line ahead. Rocket was an {{engineering}} prototype, and had not been equipped with brakes. Locke threw the engine into <b>reverse</b> <b>gear,</b> a process which took ten seconds to engage. As Rocket continued to approach, Huskisson and Holmes panicked. Holmes clung {{to the side of the}} Duke's carriage, while Huskisson made two efforts to run across the track to safety, each time returning to the side of the carriage.|$|E
5|$|The railway opened {{short of}} rolling stock as {{only half of}} the twelve {{locomotives}} and twenty-four of forty passenger carriages ordered had arrived. The carriage builders, Brown, Marshall & Co of Birmingham, stated that based on their experience they had expected the line to open at least two months late. The third day after opening to passengers, on 23 September, there was a collision between two trains at Kittybrewster that resulted in the death of a passenger and several serious injuries. The inquiry found that the driver, attempting to make up time after a late start, had over-run previous stations and been approaching the terminus with excessive speed. The driver attempted to select <b>reverse</b> <b>gear</b> to slow the train but had failed {{to hold on to the}} lever, which slipped into forward, propelling the train into carriages waiting at the platform. The report also criticised the station staff, who should not have allowed the carriages to be waiting at the station. The layout at Kittybrewster was altered after the accident.|$|E
25|$|The T-34 gearbox {{had four}} forward and one <b>reverse</b> <b>gear,</b> {{replaced}} by a five-speed box on {{the last of the}} Model 1943s. The earlier transmissions were troublesome, and some tanks went into battle with a spare transmission cabled onto the engine compartment deck.|$|E
50|$|The third type {{developed}} {{most recently}} and fitted to 7000series and 3000 Xtra machines has a wet master clutch, a six speed powershift section and a four speed range box. As reverse {{is at the}} front of the powershift section the <b>reverse</b> <b>gears</b> are spread throughout the speed range. This arrangement gives 24 forward gears (2x3x4) and 12 <b>reverse</b> <b>gears</b> (1x3x4). Note that the top three <b>reverse</b> <b>gears</b> are not available for use.|$|R

25|$|The car proved {{popular in}} the UK market, where its three-wheel {{configuration}} meant that it qualified for a lower rate of purchase tax, lower vehicle excise duty and cheaper insurance than comparable four-wheel cars. The three-wheel configuration, low weight and lack of a <b>reverse</b> <b>gear</b> also meant {{that it could be}} driven on a motor cycle licence.|$|E
25|$|The {{cabin was}} fitted with California Walnut wood trim {{on the front}} dashboard, center console, and doors as well as {{exterior}} puddle lamps, floor-well lighting, chrome door handles, an electric rear sunblind, and rear-view mirrors that would automatically tilt downward in <b>reverse</b> <b>gear.</b> Available options, including a power rear sunshade, rain-sensing windshield wipers, a DVD-based navigation system, and a Mark Levinson premium stereo system, were similar to features on the flagship LS 430 sedan.|$|E

25|$|The first 800 {{units were}} sent in reverse with a lever; all units after that were sent in reverse with a pedal between the clutch and brake pedals. The middle pedal {{was used to}} engage <b>reverse</b> <b>gear</b> when the car was in neutral. The right pedal {{operated}} the transmission brake – there were no brakes on the wheels. The floor lever also controlled the parking brake, which was activated by pulling the lever all the way back. This doubled as an emergency brake.|$|E
25|$|On some models, {{cornering}} lamps provide white steady-intensity light for lateral illumination {{in the direction}} of an intended turn or lane change. They are generally actuated in conjunction with the turn signals, and they may be wired to also illuminate when the vehicle is shifted into <b>reverse</b> <b>gear,.</b> Some modern vehicles activate the cornering lamp on one or the other side when the steering wheel input reaches a predetermined angle in that direction, regardless of whether a turn signal has been activated.|$|E
25|$|The 18 motor {{boats were}} not {{operational}} until November 1940, when a full trial {{was carried out}} with a reduced warhead against the old World War I scout cruiser Quarto. That was just six months after Italy's entry into World War II as an ally of Nazi Germany. More extensive testing before the official line-up showed once again that the boat's operational performance was limited. Therefore, an improved sea-going version was designed, the MTM (Motoscafo da Turismo Modificato), which also included a <b>reverse</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E

25|$|The design, {{using as}} many {{commercial}} components {{as possible to}} improve reliability {{and the rate of}} production, was standardized in 1940 and built by the Autocar Company, Diamond T Motor Company, and the White Motor Company. Offered with a choice of White 160AX or IHC Red Diamond 450 engines, the M3 was driven through a manual constant-mesh (non-synchromesh) transmission with four forward and one <b>reverse</b> <b>gear,</b> as well as a two-speed transfer case. The front suspension was leaf spring, tracks by vertical volute spring. Braking was vacuum-assisted hydraulic, steering manual, without power assist. The electrical system was 12-volt.|$|E
25|$|Still in Paris, Melnikov {{designed}} two privately commissioned {{versions of}} a ramped garage that never got past the conceptual drawing stage. In the second version of this project, Melnikov found a useful pattern of placing cars in a garage (again, a sawtooth pattern) where cars could park and leave without using <b>reverse</b> <b>gear.</b> The second In Moscow, Melnikov saw a new fleet of Leyland buses hoarded in a yard in Zamoskvorechye, and immediately proposed his concept to the city. The result, Bakhmetevsky Bus Garage, housed 104 buses on 8500 square meters of an unconventional, parallelogram-shaped floorplan with Vladimir Shukhov's roof system.|$|E
25|$|The Insight’s Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) {{provides}} infinite ratios to {{keep the}} engine operating within its most efficient range. Forward gear ratios are infinitely variable between 3.172–0.529 and <b>reverse</b> <b>gear</b> ranges from 4.511~1.693. Final drive is 4.20:1. On Insight EX models, paddle shifters mounted {{behind the steering wheel}} allow the driver to engage a manual shift mode and select from seven simulated gear ratios for full control over acceleration and engine braking. Since the CVT’s gear ratios are continuously variable the system electronically directs the transmission to up- or downshift into pre-determined ratios when the driver taps the shift paddles. In normal driving, the CVT allows the engine and IMA motor to stay in their most efficient operating range thereby providing superior fuel efficiency to that of a conventional automatic transmission with fixed gear ratios. The CVT’s variable gear ratios allow for both quick, initial acceleration and efficient, low-rpm cruising.|$|E

50|$|During 1920, {{most of the}} fireboxes on {{the early}} orders of the Class 14C were restayed. The <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> was of the single {{cylinder}} type and tended to creep. Hendrie therefore fitted oil cylinders and installed his Hendrie <b>reversing</b> <b>gear,</b> which was manufactured in the Pretoria workshops during 1922. Modifications were also made to the finger bars and rocking grate cylinders of the firebox and to the sanding gear. Approximately 2 lt t of lead were run into the smokebox saddle casting to provide additional weight on the leading bogie.|$|R
50|$|The <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> was {{originally}} mechanical, but was replaced on {{all but two}} of the locomotives (nos. 1355/8) by steam-operated <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> between 1932 and 1934. The steam <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> was removed again between 1941 and 1947.In 1929, No. 1656 was moved to the newly built Whitemoor Yard at March, Cambridgeshire. In 1932, this locomotive was replaced by Nos. 1355 and 1358. Whitemoor preferred the ex-GCR 0-8-4T (LNER Class S1) for hump shunting, so in 1934 No 1358 was moved to Doncaster, and No. 1355 to Mexborough. In 1936, No. 1355 moved to King's Cross to shunt the engine shed for seven weeks, before joining No. 1358 in Doncaster. These two locomotives were scrapped at Doncaster in 1937. The remaining T1s continued to work coal trains at various docks and marshalling yards throughout North East England. After World War II, coal exports never returned to their pre-war levels. Hence, many of the T1s moved to other sheds for heavy shunting duties.|$|R
25|$|The {{establishment}} of Law Number 16/2012 allowed Pindad {{to create the}} Komodo to their advantage, in which the law stipulates Indonesia to have local content used in the manufacturing of its defense products with international cooperation. The Komodo was designed in Pindad's Bandung, West Java manufacturing facility with a price tag of about USD$300,000. According to Pindad, the Komodo's monocoque armored body is bulletproof and it can withstand 7.62mm or lower caliber rifle and handgun bullets. The Komodo's glass is also made bulletproof. The Komodo's turbo intercooler diesel engine has a total horsepower of 215 PS at 2500 rpm, allowing the vehicle to achieve the weight ratio of around 30hp/ton. The Komodo can carry up to 200liters of diesel fuel. The vehicle only has a manual transmission system, which consists of 6 forward and 1 <b>reverse</b> <b>gear,</b> allowing the Komodo to have off-road capabilities. President Avianto said that the normal cruising range of the Komodo is at 450kilometers, with an average speed of 70km/h. The Komodo's off-road capabilities have been tested in various conditions ranging from mountainous terrain to mud and sand.|$|E

He also quoted: [...] "The way her career graph shot up is intriguing. Unlike others her career progressed in <b>reverse</b> <b>gear.</b> She paired up with the superstar {{during the early years of}} her career and started accepting roles with heroes of next generation." [...] She also expressed her interest to work in the project. However, plans were made to trim the film's budget due to the economic recession, and discussions were held with Nayantara to reduce her salary. The talks resulted in failure and Nayantara left the project in December 2008. Later, she was accused of cheating the director by refusing to return an advance of 15 lakh she had taken before commencement, after walking out of the film. The director filed a complaint with the Tamil Film Producers Council, which decided to ban the actress. Subsequently, Trisha was reported to have won the role, before Tamannaah was finalised as the female lead, who was signed for 80 lakh.
