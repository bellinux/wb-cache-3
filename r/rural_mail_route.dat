60|$|In a village, every clerk, every tradesman, has {{something}} of the same distinctive importance as the doctors, the lawyers, the ministers. It really makes a difference to you when Jim Smith changes from Brown's grocery to Robinson's, because Jim knows what kind of sugar-corn you like, and your second cousin married Jim's best friend. Bill Blank, the tailor, {{is not just a}} mysterious agent who produces your clothes, but a real personality, whose wife's bonnet is worth your study, even though you are the wife of the mayor. So to every person in Lipsittsville Mr. Seth Appleby was not just a lowly person on a stool who helped one in the choice of shoes. He was a person, he was their brother, to be loved or hated. If he had gone out of the shoe business there would have been something else for him to do--he would have sold farm machinery or driven on a <b>rural</b> <b>mail</b> <b>route</b> or collected rents, and have kept the same acquaintances.|$|E

[...] While serving his first term, Thompson met a number of representatives from northern states and learned his personal prejudices against them where unfounded. To help build better understanding between northern and southern representatives, and to better inform his colleagues on race issues in the south, Thompson organized {{a tour of the}} south at his personal expense.

In the mid-1880s {{there was a}} place known as Tucker's Crossroads {{in the southern part of}} Montgomery County, Alabama. Wanting an official name for the community, the people suggested to the postal service that it be named [...] "Bell Station" [...] or Tucker's Crossroads. Mr. G. T. Holiday, who would become the first postmaster, received a letter from the postal authorities that the suggested names [...] "Bell Station" [...] and Tucker's Crossroads could not be used. Mr. Holiday having just read a book entitled the [...] "Life of Henry W. Grady, suggested that the place be named [...] "Grady" [...] and the government adopted it on April 26, 1890.

50|$|After 1812, {{people started}} to settle along the St. Clair River. They were French, and didn't have legal title to the land. When the Irish moved in, the French sold their squatters rights to the Irish about 1833. Indigenous people could sell land only with the {{approval}} of the Province. Anyhow, soon after 1812, people bought up land legally along the St. Clair River. In the spring of 1820, Duncan McDonald built the first frame house. A post office opened in 1871, one time known as Lambton Village. <b>Rural</b> <b>mail</b> was first delivered in 1908, and all <b>mail</b> <b>routes</b> completed in January 1909.|$|R

40|$|Over {{a million}} {{self-employed}} Canadians {{work every day}} {{but many of them}} not entitled to the basic labour protections and rights such as minimum wages, maternity and parental leaves and benefits, pay equity, a safe and healthy working environment, and access to collective bargaining. The authors of Self-Employed Workers Organize offer a multi-disciplinary examination of the legal, political, and social realities that both limit collective action by self-employed workers and create huge impediments for unions attempting to organize them. Through case studies of newspaper carriers, <b>rural</b> <b>route</b> <b>mail</b> couriers, personal care workers, and freelance editors - four groups who have led pioneering efforts to organize - the authors provide a window into the ways political and economic conditions interact with class, ethnicity, and gender to shape the meaning and strategies of working men and women and show how these strategies have changed over time. They argue that the experiences of these workers demonstrate a pressing need to expand collective bargaining rights to include them. [URL]...|$|R
5000|$|Perdue's Sweet-Scented Manuscript was {{completed}} {{within a year}} of his [...] "retirement," [...] but was not published until 2004 when it was issued by Baskerville Pres). The novel is a love story that attempts to convey the impressions and yearnings of an 18-year-old boy, Leland Pefley, in his first exploration of the world; the novel is largely autobiographical. Perdue's next novel, Lee, was about the same Leland Pefley, now an old man, bitter, hostile, angry at a world that no longer recognized the values and culture of the 1950s. He spewed venom at those who, surrounded by beauty, culture and literature, didn't bother to avail themselves of it. Other works include The Node, Fields of Asphodel and The New Austerities, which depicts Lee Pefley's flight from New York City back to his ancestral home in Alabama. That same year, Baskerville Press published Perdue's Opportunities in Alabama Agriculture, a strange fictional account of an Alabama man, school teacher, <b>rural</b> <b>route</b> <b>mail</b> carrier, and farmer. This character, Benjamin, is loosely based on the life of Perdue's maternal grandfather.|$|R
