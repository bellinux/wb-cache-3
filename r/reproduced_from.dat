5|$|Although {{they grow}} {{naturally}} on deep sandy soils, the species has proved adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun, although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates {{the plants and}} promotes more profuse flowering in the next season. Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from some protection from prevailing winds. Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden. The species is readily propagated from fresh seed, but cultivars must be <b>reproduced</b> <b>from</b> cuttings to remain true-to-type.|$|E
5|$|The album's artwork, {{featuring}} a plastic skull with tinfoil, {{was not intended}} to be the original artwork. Both Mustaine and Ellefson had many phone conversations with Combat Records to get the cover artwork properly <b>reproduced</b> <b>from</b> a sketch given to them by Mustaine of a picture of Megadeth mascot Vic Rattlehead on the cover. However the studio lost the artwork, and instead made their own improvised and low-budget replacement, with which Mustaine and the whole band were mortified.|$|E
5|$|Several props {{and effects}} {{seen in the}} episode were <b>reproduced</b> <b>from</b> the Star Trek movies, {{including}} the shots of Earth and Spacedock One and the painting used of Starfleet Command. The doors to the room where dinner is served were later reused from season 2 onwards on the set for Ten-Forward. The episode also features two first appearances; the Ambassador class starship was mentioned {{for the first time}} (the Horatio was a member of this class, as was the Enterprise-C) and it also marks {{the first time that a}} Bolian had been seen on Star Trek, the species having been named after the episode's director. Although the parasites never appeared again on screen in any Star Trek series, they reappear in the Deep Space Nine relaunch novels, where they are revealed to be mutated Trill symbiotes.|$|E

5|$|John Gilchriese {{became friends}} with John Flood, who had been Wyatt Earp’s secretary, confidante, and best friend for many years. When Earp died, Flood {{inherited}} many of his personal belongings. Flood in turn willed them to Gilchriese, who amassed {{over a number of}} years one of the largest collections of personal items belonging to Wyatt and Virgil Earp, along with many unpublished photos of them and their family. Gilchriese opened the Wyatt Earp Museum in Tombstone in 1966 and commissioned Western artist Don Perceval to paint the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The oil on masonite painting titled The Street Fight is 6 feet 4 inches by 4 feet (1.93 m by 1.22 m). It was the largest work ever executed by Perceval. He referred to original documents in Gilchriese's collection, including Wyatt Earp's own diagram of the shootout, and unpublished notes made by John Flood, to create what is regarded as the most accurate depiction of the shootout. Gilchreise had 500 lithographic prints <b>reproduced</b> <b>from</b> the original, which Perceval signed. The prints were sold by the museum for $10.|$|E

25|$|Drosophila species {{vary widely}} in their {{reproductive}} capacity. Those such as D. melanogaster that breed in large, relatively rare resources have ovaries that mature 10–20 eggs at a time, {{so that they}} can be laid together on one site. Others that breed in more-abundant but less nutritious substrates, such as leaves, may only lay one egg per day. The eggs have one or more respiratory filaments near the anterior end; the tips of these extend above the surface and allow oxygen to reach the embryo. Larvae feed not on the vegetable matter itself, but on the yeasts and microorganisms present on the decaying breeding substrate. Development time varies widely between species (between 7 and more than 60 days) and depends on the environmental factors such as temperature, breeding substrate, and crowding. Numerous studies have shown that fruit flies lay eggs using an environmental circle. If fruit flies laid eggs at nighttime during which the environmental conditions were advantageous, the eggs could not be susceptible to desiccation from parasites. As a result, the offspring <b>reproduced</b> <b>from</b> these eggs would have greater fitness compared to offspring that were <b>reproduced</b> <b>from</b> eggs laid during the day. Since eggs are laid with a biological clock, D. melanogaster became adaptive to their environmental cycles, which showed a major advantage.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving manuscripts of Sappho, {{including the}} potsherd on which fragment 2 is preserved, {{date to the}} third century BC, and thus predate the Alexandrian edition. The latest surviving copies of Sappho’s poems transmitted directly from ancient times are written on parchment codex pages from the sixth and seventh centuries AD, and were surely <b>reproduced</b> <b>from</b> ancient papyri now lost. Manuscript copies of Sappho's works may have survived a few centuries longer, but around the 9th century her poetry appears to have disappeared, and by the twelfth century, John Tzetzes could write that [...] "the passage of time has destroyed Sappho and her works".|$|E
500|$|Travelling with Irwin was Ensign Robert Dale, who {{had somehow}} {{acquired}} Yagan's head. According to the historian Paul Turnbull, Dale {{appears to have}} persuaded Irwin to let him have the head as an [...] "anthropological curiosity". After arriving in London, Dale tried to sell the head to scientists, approaching a number of anatomists and phrenologists. His price of ₤20 failed to find a buyer, so he made an agreement with Thomas Pettigrew for the exclusive use of the head for 18 months. Pettigrew, a surgeon and antiquarian, was {{well known in the}} London social scene for holding private parties at which he unrolled and autopsied Egyptian mummies. He displayed the head on a table in front of a panoramic view of King George Sound <b>reproduced</b> <b>from</b> Dale's sketches. For effect, the head was adorned with a fresh corded headband and feathers of the red-tailed black cockatoo.|$|E
500|$|While solo {{works by}} Lennon, McCartney and Starr {{had all been}} remastered as part of {{repackaging}} campaigns during the 1990s and early 21st century, Harrison's Living in the Material World was [...] "neglected over the years", author Bruce Spizer wrote in 2005, an [...] "unfortunate" [...] situation considering {{the quality of its}} songs. On 25 September 2006, EMI reissued the album in the UK, on CD and in a deluxe CD/DVD package, with Capitol Records' US release following the next day.
