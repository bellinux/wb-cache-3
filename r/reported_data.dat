25|$|An oft-cited {{academic}} paper (Kaplan and Schoar, 2005) {{suggests that}} the net-of-fees returns to PE funds are roughly comparable to the S 500 (or even slightly under). This analysis may actually overstate the returns because it relies on voluntarily <b>reported</b> <b>data</b> and hence suffers from survivorship bias (i.e. funds that fail won't report data). One should also note that these returns are not risk-adjusted. A more recent paper (Harris, Jenkinson and Kaplan, 2012) found that average buyout fund returns in the U.S. have actually exceeded that of public markets. These findings were supported by earlier work, using a different data set (Robinson and Sensoy, 2011).|$|E
25|$|Some taxonomic {{confusion}} {{has arisen}} over Pristiurus jensenii, described from Iceland by Bjarni Sæmundsson in 1922, which {{has traditionally been}} considered the same species as G. murinus. Recently <b>reported</b> <b>data</b> for G. murinus have shown inconsistencies between sharks from Iceland and elsewhere, suggesting that P. jensenii {{may in fact be}} a valid species very similar to G. murinus. However, an alternate possibility {{is that some of the}} data may have been confounded with a species of Apristurus. The placement of G. murinus within Galeus is problematic as it does not much resemble the more typical members of the genus. On the other hand, a 2005 phylogenetic analysis by Samuel Iglésias and colleagues, based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, found that G. murinus forms a clade with G. melastomus, apart from the clade of G. eastmani, G. sauteri, and G. gracilis.|$|E

2500|$|Some of Bowlby's {{interpretations of}} the data {{reported}} by James Robertson were eventually rejected by the researcher, who <b>reported</b> <b>data</b> from 13 young children who were cared for in ideal circumstances during separation from their mothers. Robertson noted, [...] "...Bowlby acknowledges that he draws mainly upon James Robertson's institutional data. But in developing his grief and mourning theory, Bowlby, without adducing non-institutional data, has generalized Robertson's concept of protest, despair and denial beyond the context from which it was derived. He asserts {{that these are the}} usual responses of young children to separation from the mother regardless of circumstance..."; however, of the 13 separated children who received good care, none showed protest and despair, but [...] "coped with separation from the mother when cared for in conditions from which the adverse factors which complicate institutional studies were absent". In the second volume of the trilogy, Separation, published two years later, Bowlby acknowledged that Robertsons foster study had caused him to modify his views on the traumatic consequences of separation in which insufficient weight was given to the influence of skilled care from a familiar substitute.|$|E
