40|$|A {{nonlinear}} three dimensional (3 D) single rack {{model and}} a nonlinear 3 D whole pool multi-rack model are {{developed for the}} spent fuel storage <b>racks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nuclear power plant (NPP) to determine impacts and frictional motion responses when subjected to 3 D excitations from the supporting building floor. The submerged free standing rack system and surrounding water are coupled due to hydrodynamic fluid-structure interaction (FSI) using potential theory. The models developed have features that allow consideration of geometric and material nonlinearities including (1) the impacts of fuel assemblies to rack cells, a rack to adjacent racks or pool walls, and rack support legs to the pool floor; (2) the hydrodynamic coupling of fuel assemblies with their storing <b>racks,</b> and <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>rack</b> with adjacent racks, pool walls, and the pool floor; and (3) the dynamic motion behavior of rocking, twisting, and frictional sliding <b>of</b> <b>rack</b> modules. Using these models 3 D nonlinear time history dynamic analyses are performed per the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) criteria. Since few such modeling, analyses, and results using both the 3 D single and whole pool multiple rack models {{are available in the}} literature, this paper emphasizes description of modeling and analysis techniques using the SOLVIA general purpose nonlinear finite element code.

40|$|Trunks are objects loosely {{analogous}} to categories. Like a category, a trunk has vertices and edges ({{analogous to}} objects and morphisms), {{but instead of}} composition (which {{can be regarded as}} given by preferred triangles of morphisms) it has preferred squares <b>of</b> edges. <b>A</b> trunk has a natural cubical nerve, analogous to the simplicial nerve <b>of</b> <b>a</b> category. The classifying space of the trunk is the realisation of this nerve. Trunks are important in the theory <b>of</b> <b>racks</b> [8]. <b>A</b> rack X gives rise to a trunk T(X) which has a single vertex and the set X as set <b>of</b> edges. The <b>rack</b> space TX <b>of</b> X is the realisation of the nerve NT(X) of T(X). The connection between the nerve <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trunk and the usual (cubical) nerve <b>of</b> <b>a</b> category determines in particular a natural map EX [...] > BAs(X) where BAs(X) is the classifying space of the associated group of X. There is an extension to give a classifying space for an augmented rack, which has a natural map to the loop space of the Brown-Higgins classifying space of the associated crossed module [8, Section 2] and [3]. The theory can be used to define invariants of knots and links since any invariant <b>of</b> the <b>rack</b> space <b>of</b> the fundamental <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> knot or link is ipso facto <b>an</b> invariant <b>of</b> the knot or link...|$|R

40|$|Picking time {{reduction}} {{has been}} the traditional perspective for warehouse optimisation. When sustainability is considered, optimisation of warehouse operations should be read in terms of energy efficiency other than response time. Each location in the <b>rack</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> automated storage and retrieval system {{is associated with the}} value of energy consumed by the crane to reach it. Since picking performance strictly depends on storage location assignments, the time-based full turnover strategy is compared to the energy-based one. Three models of energy consumption are considered for traditional and new-generation cranes. Assignments are then compared in terms of dedicated zone shapes, time and energy performances within a given time horizon. Different shapes <b>of</b> the <b>rack</b> and product ABC curves are analysed. Dwell-point policies are also analysed from the new sustainable perspective, adding energy-saving performance to the traditional picking time reduction...|$|R

40|$|In this study, a {{simulation}} based regression analysis for <b>rack</b> configuration <b>of</b> <b>an</b> autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval system (AVS/RS) is presented.

In the regression model, the output is the average cycle time for storage and retrieval and the input variables are the number of tiers, aisles and bays that determine the size of the warehouse. The simulation model of the system is developed using ARENA 12. 0, a commercial software. We use MINITAB statistical software to complete the statistical analysis and to fit a regression function. Two different approaches are used for developing the regression analysis – stepwise regression and the best subsets. We optimize the regression function using the LINGO software. We apply this approach to a company that uses AVS/RS in France. ...|$|R
