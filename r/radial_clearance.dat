50|$|The {{second type}} of cold saw blade, {{tungsten}} carbide-tipped (TCT), are made with an alloy steel body and tungsten carbide inserts brazed to {{the tips of the}} teeth. These tips are ground on all surfaces to create tangential and <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> and provide the proper cutting and clearance angles on the teeth. The alloy body is generally made from a wear-resistant material such as a chrome vanadium steel, heat treated to 38/42 HRC. The tungsten carbide tips are capable of operating at much higher temperatures than solid HSS, therefore, TCT saw blades are usually run at much higher surface speeds. This allows carbide-tipped blades to cut at faster rates and still maintain an acceptable chip load per tooth. These blades are commonly used for cutting non-ferrous alloys, but have gained significant popularity for ferrous metal cutting applications in the last 10 years. The tungsten carbide inserts are extremely hard (98 HRC) and capable of very long wear life. However, they are less resistant to shock than solid HSS cold saw blades. Any vibration during the cutting process may severely damage the teeth. These cold saw blades need to be driven by a backlash free gear box and a constant feed mechanism like a ball-screw feed.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In this paper, a <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> of {{a journal}} {{bearings}} and the metrology of the <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> measurement is described. Design/methodology/approach: In this experimental study out-of-roundness and <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> of journal bearings were measured with high precision {{and the impact}} of their metrology was examined on the specific oil film thickness of the bearing. Some metrological issues were emerged and these should be taken into account when bearings are designed. Findings: An investigation showed that the <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> measurements can vary from one measuring device to another and the specified clearance may not necessarily meet the design criteria of specific oil film thickness. The study indicates that the <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> measurement can differ from one measuring device to another depending upon the precision that can be achieved by the device. The radius of the bearing or the shaft also varies along the circumference, mainly due to out-of-roundness. The out-of-roundness contributes to the error in <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> measurement and hence similar to the cut off length specified with the surface roughness, the out-of-roundness needs to be specified with the <b>radial</b> <b>clearance.</b> Practical implications: The <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> of a journal bearing is a key design parameter and bearing performance mainly depends upon this parameter. In this paper was showed that the metrology of the <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> measurement plays a significant role and not only that the bearing manufacturer or the user of the bearing is aware of this fact but the bearing designer must also take this fact into account while designing bearings.

Two Generation III foil air bearings with the same design but possessing different initial radial clearances were tested at room temperature against an as-ground PS 304 coated journal operating at 30, 000 rpm. Increases in <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> were accomplished by reducing the journal's outside diameter via an in-place grinding system. From each load capacity test the bearing load capacity coefficient was calculated from the rule-of-thumb (ROT) model developed for foil air bearings. The test results indicate that, {{in terms of the}} load capacity coefficient, <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> has a direct impact on the performance of the foil air bearing. Each test bearing exhibited an optimum <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> that resulted in a maximum load capacity coefficient. Relative to this optimum value are two separate operating regimes that are governed by different modes of failure. Bearings operating with radial clearances less than the optimum exhibit load capacity coefficients that are a strong function of <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> and are prone to a thermal runaway failure mechanism and bearing seizure.

40|$|Compliant foil air {{bearings}} are at {{the forefront}} of the Oil-Free turbomachinery revolution, which supports gas turbine engines with hydrodynamic bearings that use air instead of oil as the working fluid. These types of bearings have been around for almost 50 years and have found a home in several commercial applications, such as in air cycle machines, turbocompressors, and microturbines, but are now being aggressively pursued for use in small and midrange aircraft gas turbine engines. Benefits include higher operating speeds and temperatures, lower maintenance costs, and greater reliability. The Oil-Free Turbomachinery team at the NASA Glenn Research Center is working to foster the transition of Oil-Free technology into gas turbine engines by performing in-house experiments on foil air bearings in order to gain a greater insight into their complex operating principles. A research program recently undertaken at Glenn focused on the concept of <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> and its influence on bearing performance. The tests were conducted on foil bearings with different radial clearances. As defined for a foil bearing, <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> is a measure of the small amount of shaft radial motion that is present from play that exists in the elastic support structure, such as between the top and bump foils and the bump foils and bearing shell (see the drawing). With an insufficient amount of <b>radial</b> <b>clearance,</b> the bearing imparts a high preload on the shaft, which when excessive, can reduce the loadcarrying capability of the bearing. On the other hand, systems using foil bearings with excessive <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> may experience rotordynamic instabilities because of low bearing preload. Therefore, without a more thorough understanding of <b>radial</b> <b>clearance,</b> it is difficult to accurately predict the performance of a given bearing design. The test program demonstrated that there is a direct correlation between <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> and the performance of foil air bearings. As shown in the graph, an optimum <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> exists that will maximize the amount of load that the bearing is capable of supporting. With respect to this optimum, two different performance regimes were observed that are a function of the amount of <b>radial</b> <b>clearance.</b> Tests showed that bearings with radial clearances below the optimum in regime I were susceptible to sudden seizure, a failure mode indicative of thermal runaway caused by high preload. The high preload is in response to an insufficient amount of <b>radial</b> <b>clearance</b> available to accommodate the thermal growth of the bearing and shaft. However, radial clearances greater than the optimum in regime II resulted in low bearing preloads that did not cause any heat-related problems, and the failure mode was due to fluid-film breakdown. In fact, bearings operating with radial clearances twice as much as the optimum suffered a decrease in the maximum load capacity of only about 20 percent. Therefore, special attention has to be given to the range of operating conditions expected in the bearing/shaft system since changes in temperature, centrifugal, and hydrodynamic effects can all affect <b>radial</b> <b>clearance.</b> This enhanced understanding of foil air bearing behavior will greatly aid our efforts to transition Oil-Free technology to future aircraft engines...|$|E

Calibrated the measured part using the standard gauge block. Improved the circle and the line sub-pixel methods. Experiment results showed that the fitting error of improved least–square linear fitting method was quarter of ordinary least–square linear fitting error under small difference of orientation time. The diameters of the inner circle and the outer circle,the roundness error,the tooth cusp angle and the radial rake angle, the <b>radial</b> direction <b>clearance</b> angle were respectively 25. 204 mm, 193. 624 mm, 0. 005 mm, 59. 999 °± 0. 00695 °, 15. 004 °± 0. 0104 °, 14. 997 °± 0. 0137 ° while taken sub-pixel method...|$|R
40|$|For {{accurate}} {{fault detection}} and diagnosis, this paper {{focuses on the}} study of bearing vibration responses under increasing <b>radial</b> <b>clearances</b> due to investable wear and different bearing grades. A nonlinear dynamic model incorporating with local defects and clearance increments is developed for a deep groove ball bearing. The model treats the inner race-shaft and outer race-housing as two lumped masses which are coupled by a nonlinear spring formalized by the Hertzian contact deformation between the balls and races. The solution of the nonlinear equation is obtained by a Runge-Kutta method in Matlab. The results show that the vibrations at fault characteristic frequencies exhibit significant changes with increasing clearances. However, an increased vibration is found for the outer race fault whereas a decreased vibration is found for inner race fault. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account these changes in determining the size of faults...|$|R
40|$|The {{rolling element}} bearing is {{a key part of}} machines. The {{accurate}} and timely diagnosis of its faults is critical for predictive maintenance. Most re-searches have focused on the fault location identification. To estimate the fault severity accurately, this paper focuses on the study of roller bearing vibration amplitude under increasing <b>radial</b> <b>clearances</b> due to inevitable wear using the modulation signal bispectrum (MSB). The experiment is carried out for bearings with two different clearances for the inner race fault and the outer race fault cases. The results show that the vibration amplitudes at fault characteristic frequencies exhibit significant changes with increasing clearances. However, the amplitudes of vibrations tend to increase with the severity of the outer race fault and decrease with the severity of the inner race fault. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account these effects in diagnosing the size of defect...|$|R
