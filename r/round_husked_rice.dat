This study focuses on the standard of living of rice farmers, production structure, rice selling, marketing channel, rice prices, profit by intermediaries, marketing efficiency and farmers` attitudes towards marketing. The study is based on data collected through a survey of 33 farmers and 25 intermediaries carried out during July to August 2003 in Jhikargacha Upazila in Jessore district, south-western part of Bangladesh. In the surveyed area six types of middlemen and eighteen types of major marketing channels were identified. The study found that 27 (82 %) farmers sold exclusively unhusked rice and only 6 (18 %) farmers sold partially <b>husked</b> <b>rice.</b> The quantity of unhusked rice sold to wholesalers of unhusked rice, stockists, huskers and village merchants were 3297 and 14 %, respectively. Although, among all eighteen channels <b>husked</b> <b>rice</b> selling to retailers of <b>husked</b> <b>rice</b> was observed to be the best channel, only 3 % of unhusked rice was converted to <b>husked</b> <b>rice</b> and sold through this channel. <b>Husked</b> <b>rice</b> sold through wholesalers of <b>husked</b> <b>rice</b> was also found to be a comparatively efficient channel, but only 5 % of unhusked rice was converted to <b>husked</b> <b>rice</b> and sold through this channel.

The data is processed and displayed in graphical form, then do a comparative analysis between the characteristics of the AC-BC mixture that uses <b>rice</b> <b>husk</b> ash andwithout <b>rice</b> <b>husk</b> ash. The results of the study found that increasing the percentage of <b>rice</b> <b>husk</b> ash content in the mix AC-BC tendsto increase the use of bitumen content. It can be seen from the increasing value of Optimum Bitumen Content(OBC) on <b>rice</b> <b>husk</b> ash variation of 0 % - 50 %. The results also gain an increase in the durability of the ACBCmixtureofricehuskashonthevariationof 0 %- 5 %asindicatedbytheincreasedtheresidualstabilityvalueofthe AC-BC pavementmixtures.

40|$|Exergy is a {{measurement}} {{of how far}} a certain system or material deviates from a state of equilibrium with the environment {{and it is a}} useful tool for improving the efficiency of energy-resource use. Based on the previous work, the exergy values of six <b>rice</b> <b>husks</b> were investigated in this study. The effects of physical and chemical properties were also detailed. These included moisture content, ash content, S, C, O, H and N contents. The moisture related exergy of the six <b>rice</b> <b>husks</b> ranged in 241. 432 - 290. 304 kJ per kg <b>rice</b> <b>husk,</b> accounting for 1. 563 - 1. 758 % of the exergy of <b>rice</b> <b>husks.</b> An exponential relationship between exergy value and moisture content was observed. The exergy of ash varied between 37. 419 kJ per kg <b>rice</b> <b>husk</b> and 61. 217 kJ per kg <b>rice</b> <b>husk,</b> making up 0. 233 - 0. 401 % of the exergy of <b>rice</b> <b>husks.</b> An exponential linear relationship between exergy value and ash content was observed. The S related exergy ranged from 1. 217 kJ per kg <b>rice</b> <b>husk</b> to 2. 993 kJ per kg <b>rice</b> <b>husk,</b> accounting for 0. 007 - 0. 018 % of the exergy of <b>rice</b> <b>husks.</b> The O/C, H/C and N/C atomic ratios varied in ranges of 0. 592 - 0. 662, 1. 404 - 1. 730 and 0. 008 - 0. 011, respectively, whereas the correlation factors varied slightly in the range of 1. 118 - 1. 127. The exergy values of the six <b>rice</b> <b>husks</b> ranged in 15. 053 - 18. 407 MJ/kg. They were mainly determined by the correlatio...|$|R
