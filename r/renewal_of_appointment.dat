Heisey publicly suggested that the province might have {{to take over the}} board when two board members left a meeting to deprive it of quorum. Heisey had said he would resign if the [...] "dysfunctional" [...] board did not regain its composure. In June 2004, he announced {{that he would not be}} seeking a <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> his board <b>appointment</b> and told the media [...] "The police board job is kind of like being a general. There's a peacetime general and there's a wartime general. And I think the peacetime chair job would have been quite manageable with my other responsibilities." [...] The board later in June voted not to renew Chief Fantino's contract, with media reporting Heisey had voted against renewal.|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} role of {{regional}} import flows for <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> regional industries. The hypothesis is that imports stimulate <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> local industries by being vehicles for technology diffusion and means by which local firms can exploit advantages of global specialisation. We find robust and positive relationships between high-quality imports and <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> regional exports, where the latter are measured {{by the introduction of}} novel export products of local firms. Connectedness to international markets via import networks appears to be a stimulus for the <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> regional exports...|$|R

40|$|The {{behavioural}} therapies predominantly use {{exposure to}} feared stimuli {{in the treatment}} of anxiety disorders. However, clients frequently experience a return of fear after treatment and this may increase the likelihood of relapse occurring. Return of fear via a renewal effect is the most frequently studied source of return <b>of</b> fear. <b>Renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear occurs when the previously feared object is encountered in a context that is different to the treatment context. The present chapter reviews clinical-analogue studies that have investigated the <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear. Prior research has confirmed the validity <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> as a mechanism for the <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear in high fearful and phobic individuals. Moreover, prior research has shown that factors such as phobic cognitions and pre-treatment fear can predict the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear occurring. The review also highlights the methodologies used to detect <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear and subsequently reduce <b>renewal.</b> Applications <b>of</b> the research to reduce the return <b>of</b> fear via <b>renewal</b> following exposure therapy are discussed.
