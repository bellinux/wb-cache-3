500|$|After a [...] "fierce bidding war", on April 5, 2005, it was {{announced}} that Spears had signed a deal with UPN to air a reality television series documenting her relationship with Federline. The series, which would air in five episodes, was revealed to chronicle the relationship [...] "from the earliest stages of their courtship to their engagement and ultimately, their stroll down the aisle". In a statement about the series, Spears stated: [...] "From the day that Kevin and I met, there have been constant rumors and inaccurate speculation about our lives together. I feel that last year, the tabloids <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> life, and I am really excited about showing my fans what really happened, rather than all the stories, which have been misconstrued by journalists in the past. As I mentioned before, I am now going to be expressing my personal life through art".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the best}} efforts of the slaveholders, Tubman was never captured, and neither were the fugitives she guided. Years later, she told an audience: [...] "I was {{conductor}} of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I can say what most conductors can't say – I never <b>ran</b> <b>my</b> train off the track and I never lost a passenger." [...] One of her last missions into Maryland was to retrieve her aging parents. Her father, Ben, had purchased Rit, her mother, in 1855 from Eliza Brodess for 20 dollars. But even when they were both free, the area became hostile to their presence. Two years later, Tubman received word that her father had harbored a group of eight escaped slaves, and was at risk of arrest. She traveled to the Eastern Shore and led them north to St. Catharines, Ontario, where a community of former slaves (including Tubman's brothers, other relatives, and many friends) had gathered.|$|E
