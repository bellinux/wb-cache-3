40|$|Evidence that leptin regulates bone {{turnover}} {{in part through}} a central nervous system (CNS) /beta-adrenergic system <b>relay</b> has <b>driven</b> attention towards the potential therapeutic benefits of beta-adrenergic blockade to improve bone mass and strength. beta 2 - adrenergic receptor-mediated signaling in osteoblasts inhibits bone formation and triggers RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. Mouse models of adrenergic-deficiency, particularly the mouse lacking the beta 2 -adrenergic receptor, have increased bone mass, more specifically increased trabecular bone volume. In turn, beta-blockers, such as propranolol, were reported to inhibit ovariectomy-induced bone loss. In contrast, a number of experiments in mice and rats suggest that inhibition of beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated signaling does not improve, and could actually be detrimental, for bone mass and microstructure. In humans, epidemiological observations suggested that users of beta-blockers have higher bone mineral density (BMD) and/or a reduced risk of fractures, yet not all studies were concordant.

40|$|The fatigue {{strength}} of high-strength {{materials such as}} wire is, essentially, dependent on the surface state, stress concentrators, non-metal inclusions, etc. Multifactorial process of damage accumulation and fracture under cyclic loading {{makes it difficult to}} predict the durability of structural materials. So fatigue tests, taking into account the operating conditions of stress exposure as much as possible, are of special importance. A feature of the wire fatigue tests is that it is complicated to secure the samples and create the alternate stresses. Currently, there is no equipment to study the {{fatigue strength}} of the wire in accordance with GOST 1579 - 93. Partly the problem of the wire fatigue tests was solved owing to using the installation developed in IMET RAS and considered as the base case. However, the installation has significant disadvantages, namely: a complicated for implementing in practice method to control stresses in the sample; an imperfect system to count cycles; an incapability to change the engine speed of the motor and thus, the frequency of loading. In developing the new design all the basic blocks of installation were upgraded such as drive unit; unit to control stress in the sample; unit for determining the number of cycles to failure. To change the stresses in the sample the paper offers to use the platform from polymethylmethacrylate with slotted curved channels of different radii. The stresses in the sample are dependent on the channel radius R, the wire diameter d and the modulus of elasticity E of the material and may vary in the range of 200 - 1200 MPa. The use of CNC machines in cutting the channels allows stress adjustment within ± 0, 1 MPa. The developed design is used to drive the rotation of the wire and makes it possible to change the frequency of loading in the range of 0 - 100 Hz. It is shown that the use of the closing <b>relay</b> in <b>drive</b> design and the transition to an electronic system of determining the number of cycles to failure significantly improves the repeatability of results in fatigue tests.

Ann-Maree and Crystal-Rose would have to slalom through traffic cones - forward and then backward. Alaina and Marc would then {{have to do a}} handbrake turn and reverse into a small box marked off by cones. Bob and David would last have to do two figure 8s around cones on a skidpan. The race against the clock was two laps, with each player needing to do their trick once in turn, on a fifteen-minute time limit. After completing their leg, the players had to hand the car off to the next person inside a box marked by blue flags. They were given some training and a dry run, but during the real run, there would be on top of each cone an egg, which, if dislodged, would cost a $500 penalty from the potential $10,000 value of the assignment. The first lap went strongly, with Ann-Maree slaloming perfectly, Marc doing a strong handbrake turn and reversing into the box (but losing time as he didnt back up completely the first time), and David quickly completing his figure 8 laps on the skidpan. The second lap was less fluid - Crystal-Rose slalomed perfectly just as Ann-Maree had (and was cruising instead of racing, losing time), but Alaina knocked over two cones on her handbrake turn and Bob lost several seconds on the skidpan in addition to forgetting to put his seat belt on as he took off. They completed the race in 13 minutes 35 seconds. David, however, had not had his seatbelt on when he backed the car into the box of blue flags on the changeover to Crystal-Rose, after he had first overshot it. This meant he had to do his part again, in the 1 minute 25 seconds that remained on the clock. He made it with 2 seconds to spare, so $9,000 was won.|$|R
40|$|In general {{electric}} field forces have the distinctive property {{of being able}} to mediate forces to virtually any material in a fully non-invasive and contact-free fashion. Based on this property, electrostatic levitation holds great promise for the semiconductor, solar panel, and flat-panel display industry since the handling of (semi) conducting and dielectric materials in a contact-free manner can bring many advantages and solve long-standing contamination and particulate control problems. These problems arise from the direct mechanical contact through which dielectric and semiconductor materials are commonly handled by process equipment in these industrial areas. Direct mechanical contact can cause chemical and particulate contamination of the handled material. Furthermore, it can result in electrostatic charging through tribo-electric effects, which raises the electrostatic potential of the handled material causing air-borne particles to be attracted to it. Ultimately, chemical and particulate contamination can critically affect performance, reliability, and product yield of the manufactured devices. Electrostatic levitation offers the inherent capability to avoid these contamination problems. In addition to enhancing contamination control, electrostatic levitation can provide uniformly distributed suspension forces. This is an advantage in the handling of very large and thin glass substrates used in the manufacture of flat panel displays as it leads to minimal mechanical deformation of the substrates. This thesis presents a comprehensive and in-depth study on the use of electrostatic fields for the contact-free suspension of (semi) conducting and dielectric materials. The electrostatic levitation devices that have been developed are specifically geared toward novel applications in the semiconductor and flat-panel display industry. Closed-loop feedback control is necessary to stabilize the position and attitude of the levitated object. In order to stably levitate an object, only three degrees of freedom are required to be actively controlled, i. e. the vertical motion and the angular motions represented by the pitch and roll angles. The lateral and longitudinal movements are passively stabilized by restrictive forces originating from the fringing fields existing between the outer edges of the stator electrodes and the suspended object. A generic voltage-controlled electrostatic levitator for the contact-free suspension of conducting disks or panels was developed first. Its main building blocks consist of a feedback controller, high-voltage dc amplifiers, displacement sensors, and a stator electrode structure. Simple guidelines based on the assumption of uniform electric fields are established for the design of suitable stator electrode patterns and applied voltage distributions, which guarantee electric potentials on disks/panels close to zero volts. Squeeze film air damping plays a major role since it may impact the dynamic behavior of the levitator significantly. The reason for this {{lies in the fact that}} the forces arising from squeeze film damping can approach values that are of the same order of magnitude as the electrostatic suspension forces. We also investigated both theoretically and experimentally the restrictive lateral forces produced by the fringing fields. These forces are weaker than the levitation forces. In line with the theoretical model, the measurements show that the lateral force can be increased by applying higher stator voltage magnitudes or by decreasing the air gap separation. Based on these observations, the stator design was improved by adding a ring of peripheral sector electrodes having the primary function of generating the fringing fields. Levitation experiments have been conducted in an atmospheric environment, demonstrating the successful suspension of a 4 -inch silicon wafer, having a mass of 9. 4 g, at a nominal gap separation of 300 µm utilizing centralized PID feedback control. At constant ring electrode voltages of ± 1. 2 kV, a lateral stiffness value of 0. 84 N/m was produced by the improved stator produced, which corresponds to an increase of a factor of 5. 5 relative to the conventional stator. A major and growing industrial area of potential application of electrostatic levitation constitutes liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturing. Glass substrates are basic and essential components in LCDs. They belong to the class of lossy dielectrics. Their charge relaxation times may complicate the task of levitating them stably. A stator electrode suitable for the levitation of lossy dielectrics consists of a regular planar array of parallel bar electrodes to which voltages of differing polarities are alternatingly applied. We develop a general analytical model of the levitation field and force on a lossy dielectric plate produced by this stator electrode. This model takes into account the influence of the atmospheric humidity on the electrostatic charging dynamics. The levitation force dynamics are studied by evaluating the transient response of the field under a step in the applied voltages. In this context, the rate of electric charge build up on the plate is characterized by the suspension initiation time (TSI), which is defined as the time elapsed between applying step voltages to the stator electrodes and start of lift-off of the dielectric plate from its initial position. TSI is theoretically predicted for 0. 7 mm thick soda-lime glass substrates, typically used in the manufacturing of liquid crystal displays (LCDs), as a function of electrode geometry, air gap separation, ambient humidity, and step voltage magnitudes. The predicted results are shown to be in good agreement with previously published experimental data. Position measurement based on capacitive sensing technology has been investigated as well since it can lead to an improved level of levitator cleanliness. This stems from the fact that the sensing electrodes can be integrated into the stator electrodes rendering compact, planar structures. A charge-discharge capacitive displacement sensor with improved stray capacitance immunization capabilities was developed. In addition a simple and cost-effective capacitive sensor using the oscillation principle was designed and realized. Both sensors have been calibrated for different target materials, i. e. silicon, aluminum, and soda-lime and quartz glass. Measurements demonstrate a good linear behavior for both sensors. The final part of this thesis deals with cost-effective and compact electrostatic levitator designs. These designs are characterized by small footprints to ensure cleanliness and scalable to many degrees of freedom multi-electrode levitators without incurring excessive and prohibitive economic costs. The first designed levitator is <b>driven</b> by a <b>relay</b> based switching controller. Its key properties are that it is devoid of high-voltage dc amplifiers and a maximum number of only two high-voltage power supplies, capable of delivering constant dc voltages, are required. This number is entirely independent of the number of individually controlled stator electrodes. The inherent switching nature of the system imposes limit cycle oscillations on the levitated object. It is due to the squeeze-film air damping that these oscillations can be significantly suppressed, in particular at small gap separations down to 100 µm or lower. Successful levitation has been achieved for 4 -inch silicon wafers, 100 × 100 mm quartz glass substrates, and a highly flexible aluminum sheet measuring 280 × 280 mm, respectively. Experiments with the silicon wafer and glass substrates at reference air gap separations down to 100 µm or lower demonstrate limit cycle amplitudes below 1 µm. The second levitator is based on hysteresis control and represents a fundamental improvement on the first levitator in that it enables incorporating active damping in the system through derivative control. This fact opens up the possibility of operating the levitator in vacuum without degradation in performance as demonstrated by simulations. Overall, the proposed levitator retains largely the advantages of the <b>relay</b> control <b>driven</b> levitator. A 4 -inch silicon wafer was levitated successfully at a reference gap separation of 200 µm exhibiting a good transient and steady-state suspension performance. The measured switching period was 1. 5 ms and the amplitude of the voltage ripple was 10 V. The stability of the limit cycles in both levitators has been analyzed using the describing function method and Filippov’s theory. The first method follows an approximate approach while the second method offers a more precise avenue of tackling the stability analysis coupled with the key capability of analyzing multi-DOF systems.
