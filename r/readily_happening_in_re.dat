40|$|This {{article is}} based on an {{empirical}} study focusing on how the headmasters in Norway understand their role of being put in charge of the compulsory education, and their freedom of action in connection with religious education. Their space of action is limited by the constraints laid down in the school's foundation documents, and of a traditionally autonomous teacher culture. The headmasters understand their role more as a leadership role than as an administrator role, and although they seldom attempt to influence the actual teaching directly, they pay close attention to what is <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> the <b>RE</b> lessons...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{two aspects of}} {{teaching}} about Islam in Secondary schools in South West England: teaching about Islam post 9 / 11, and teaching Religious Education (<b>RE)</b> <b>in</b> an area with a small minority ethnic population. The aim {{of the study was}} to gather Religious Education teachers' recollections of, and reflections on, their experience, and to construct from these, a better understanding of what is <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> classes that concentrate on Islam. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 teachers from Secondary schools. They were digitally recorded and then transcribed. This data was then categorised using the N 6 software package for qualitative data. The analysis followed a grounded theory approach whereby emergent themes formed the basis for discussion and hypothesis. Five broad themes were closely examined. The key findings were that: Pupils had a mixed response to learning about Islam. Teaching about Islam in a region with a small minority ethnic population raised a number of key issues such as the need to deal with misconceptions and handle debate carefully. A positive school ethos and a whole school approach to discipline and maintaining values underpinned classroom practice. Both long and short term strategies, such as creating a safe environment and using discussion as a learning tool, were necessary to enhance teaching about Islam. Finally it was recommended that initial teacher training should address the impact of the ethnic make-up of different regions on the teaching of Islam, and that the use of dialogue should be at the heart of the training programme.

"It may <b>readily</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>in</b> an idolatrous nation, {{that though}} men [...] admit the {{existence}} of several limited deities, yet there is some [...] one God, whom, in a particular manner, they make the object of [...] their worship and adoration. They may either suppose, that, in the [...] distribution of power and territory among the Gods, their nation [...] was subjected to the jurisdiction of that particular deity; or, [...] reducing heavenly objects to the model of things below, they may [...] represent one god as the prince or supreme magistrate of the rest, [...] who, though of the same nature, rules them with an authority like [...] that which an earthly sovereign exerts over his subjects and [...] vassals. Whether this god, therefore, be considered as their [...] peculiar patron, or as the general sovereign of heaven, his [...] votaries will endeavour, by every art, to insinuate themselves into [...] his favour; and supposing him to be pleased, like themselves, with [...] praise and flattery, there is no eulogy or exaggeration which will [...] be spared in their addresses to him. In proportion as men's fears [...] or distresses become more urgent, they still invent new strains of [...] adulation; and even he who outdoes his predecessor in swelling the [...] titles of his divinity, {{is sure to be}} outdone by his successor in [...] newer and more pompous epithets of praise. Thus they proceed, till [...] at last they arrive at infinity itself, beyond which there is no [...] further progress; And it is well if, in striving to get further, [...] and to represent a magnificent simplicity, they run not into [...] inexplicable mystery, and destroy the intelligent nature of their [...] deity, on which alone any rational worship or adoration can be [...] founded. While they confine themselves to the notion of a perfect [...] being, the Creator of the world, they coincide, by chance, with the [...] principles of reason and true philosophy; though they are guided to [...] that notion, not by reason, of which they are in a great measure [...] incapable, but by the adulation and fears of the most vulgar [...] superstition."--(IV. pp. 463-6.) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{crystallization}} dynamics of nanoparticles reversibly tethered by DNA hybridization. We {{show that the}} crystallization <b>happens</b> <b>readily</b> only <b>in</b> a narrow temperature "slot," and always proceeds via a two-step process, mediated by a highly-connected amorphous intermediate. For lower temperature quenches, the dynamics of unzipping strands in the amorphous state is sufficiently slow that crystallization is kinetically hindered. This accounts for the well-documented difficulty of forming crystals in these systems. The strong parallel to the crystallization behavior of proteins and colloids suggests that these disparate systems crystallize in an apparently universal manner.

The plan is partly designed to start assessing the necessary steps {{required to keep}} up with the natural changes in the climate, environment, and ecosystems. According to the plan, predictions gathered in 2007 by a panel on climate change deem average air temperatures to change in North America by 1-3Â°C between the years 2010 and 2039. Correlating with climate change, scientists also predict that new plant and animal congregations and associations will change the environment and the ecosystem [...] For more natural changes <b>happening</b> <b>readily</b> <b>in</b> the ecosystems and habitat, the plan stresses that insects such as bark beetles and budworms combined with drought are significantly changing the Wyoming landscape.|$|R
50|$|If the {{contract}} theory is preferred, then {{the rules of}} the association will govern the distribution of the rights held by the association. These rules may contain an express term relating to the dissolution of the society, in which case it is considered operative. If not, a term can be implied as to the arrangements, as <b>happened,</b> for example, <b>in</b> <b>Re</b> Bucks Constabulary Widows and Orphans Fund Friendly Society (no 2). This will normally divide the rights up equally among those who were members at the time of dissolution. In the case of dissolution for lack of members, obiter comments in the case indicate that the rights will pass to the Crown as bona vacantia, because, at the time of dissolution, there are no remaining members. That conclusion, however, has been contested by those who believe beneficial ownership by the last surviving member is more appropriate. There may be cases where, as a result of {{the contract}}ual obligations of the members, no member can claim the assets of the association upon dissolution and the Crown will therefore be entitled to them as bona vacantia.|$|R

40|$|Guinea pigs {{were divided}} into the next four groups {{for the purpose of}} {{examining}} the effects of exhaustive physical exercise and fatigue after exposing to X-ray. (1) Non treated group (C) (2) Exercised control group (EC) (3) Radiated control group (RC) (4) Radiated exercised group (RE) The X-ray apparatus was operated at. 200 KV, 15 mA, 0. 5 mm Copper and 0. 5 mm Alminium filtration, 50 cm focus target distance. The dose was 200 r of. X-ray whole body irradiation in dose rate of 80. 6 r/min (in the air). Subjects of this experiment were given 30 successive days of swimming at the rate of 30 minutes per day and 5 days per week. The results are as follows: (1) The 30 days survival rate of RE was lower than that of RC. (2) The decreasing rate of the body weight <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> was a little higher than that in RC. (3) The prolongation of the blood clotting time <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> was greater than that in RC. (4) The decreasing rate of red cell count <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> was a little higher than that in RC. In both groups the decreasing rate was the highest on the 14 th day after the treatment. (5) The decreasing rate of hemoglobin content <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> was a little higher than that in RC. In both groups the decreasing rate was the highest on the 14 th day after the treatment. (6) Reticulocyte count <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> and RC decreased in the beginning, but increased extremely on the 21 st day after treatment. Its increasing and decrasing rate <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> was little different from that in RC. (7) The increasing rate of Heinz body <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> was higher than that in RC. (8) The decresing rate of white cell count <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> was not significantly different from that in RC. In both groups the white cell count was at minimum on the 14 th day after treatment. (9) Concerning the classification of white cell, i. e. basophile., eosinophile-, neutrophile leucocyte, lymphocyte and monocyte, RE was not significantly different from RC. (10) About the changes of plasma proteins, a) The total protein in RC decreased a little in the beginning, but slightly increased in the latter period. That <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> showed little change in the beginning, and slightly increased in the latter period. Difference between RE and RC was not significant, b) A/G ratio did not change much in the beginning in RC as well as <b>RE,</b> but <b>in</b> the latter period it decreased in RC while increased <b>in</b> <b>RE.</b> c) Albumin didn't show much change in the beginning both <b>in</b> RC and <b>RE,</b> but it decreased a little in the latter period where as in RC it increased <b>in</b> <b>RE.</b> d) Î±-globulin <b>in</b> RC and <b>RE</b> increased a little after the treatment.
