50|$|The Scammell Townsman {{replaced}} the 3-ton Scarab. There was {{no provision for}} a 6-ton model; more conventional vehicles were used {{to take on the}} heavier role. The Townsman closely followed the Scarab in its basic design. The frame was of a welded construction and had integral coupling ramps fitted with Scammell Mechanical Horse automatic coupling. The engine, gearbox and driving axle formed a rigid assembly pivoted at the front end in a large <b>rubber</b> <b>bush.</b> A vacuum operated release mechanism {{replaced the}} hand lever mechanism used in the Scarab. The futuristic lines of the fibreglass cab were a novelty. Use of GRP for the cab had allowed for a more complex shape to be employed. Scammell had experience with GRP cabs in heavy lorries such as the Routeman, Trunker and Handyman with cabs designed by Michelotti. The new cab had many new developments, such as vacuum-assisted hydraulic brakes, a heater-demister, two rear view mirrors, interior sun-visors, totally enclosed oil-immersed coil spring front suspension and dual rate mounting of semi-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. Later a larger engine was fitted; the Leyland OE160, being an in-house product due to Scammell being part of the Leyland Group. The Townsman had better driver controls and faster road speed (50 mph) but still lacked brakes on all wheels; only the rear axle had brakes. Legislation in the late 1960s regarding braking of goods vehicles meant that the working days of the innovative Scammells was nearing an end.|$|E

40|$|Many modern {{cars with}} rear-wheel drives have a two-piece, {{rather than the}} {{traditional}} one-piece, props haft (or tail-shaft). The two-piece shaft requires less floor clearance, and hence a smaller floor tunnel, and does not suffer from the high-speed twisting resonances to which the one-piece shaft is susceptible. The two-piece shaft is, however, susceptible to a lower speed, high load (high torque) phenomenon in which the propshaft whirls with increasing amplitude until its restraining <b>rubber</b> <b>bush</b> is fully compressed in its mounting bracket, causing a thump sound. The whirling amplitude builds up periodically, so that a regular series of thumps is heard at a frequency of about 5 per second. The effect is very sensitive to {{the properties of the}} <b>rubber</b> <b>bush</b> and to its temperature. Different designs of bush are used by different makers, each with the purpose of minimizing both the whirling problem and the transmission of other vibrations to the car body. GMH has a particular design which it would prefer not to vary, because of retooling costs. It can however vary the properties of the rubber material itself. By trial and error it has achieved rubber properties which control the whirling problem to an acceptable level under normal conditions. GMH posed the question, to the MISG, of whether one can give theoretical guidelines for optimal rubber properties. This might lead to improved control of the whirling problem. It would also be useful for new and modified propshafts, if it could replace the tedious trial and error process previously employed. GMH were also anxious {{to gain a better understanding}} of the whirling phenomenon, and felt, with us, that a mathematical description of the phenomenon was a prerequisite for the study of the rubber properties. The thumping phenomenon is observed at both 40 and 80 kph approximately, although the phenomenon had a different quality at these two speeds...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to utilize the frequency-dependent viscoelastic material model and characterize the dynamic response of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> under external excitation. Furthermore, with appropriate modeling, two heat generation mechanisms of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> are explored and their thermal fields are investigated. Due to the nonlinear force-deflection relationship of the viscoelastic material, finding satisfactory mechanical properties of rubber components still poses a great challenge. However, industry nowadays is in urgent demand for precise finite element analysis (FEA) modeling of rubber components. For example, a proper constitutive relationship of rubber components is critical to providing a reliable and trustable simulation of vehicle suspension systems. As for current FEA commercial software, the frequency-dependent modulus of viscoelastic material hasn 2 ̆ 7 t been presented well and they have failed to provide satisfactory results. Therefore, two approaches, FEA and the multi-body dynamic analysis have been selected together to give a more comprehensive and credible prediction of suspension system 2 ̆ 7 s performance in different working conditions. The FEA approach evaluated the stability of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> in view of the dynamic response and temperature distribution under high frequency excitation. With these results, the life prediction of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> becomes more feasible. The multi-body dynamic analysis explores the structure instability of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> when exposed to extremely high frequency and estimates the energy dissipation in the rubber core. ^ The key innovations of this paper can be classified into four aspects. The first one is the application of multi-body dynamics in the dynamic analysis of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing.</b> Based on experimental modal analysis, the sandwich cylindrical <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> is treated as multi-body. With the multi-body model, the transfer function of the <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> is calculated in order to estimate the dynamic response. The second innovation comes from the development of the FORTRAN program to solve the system transfer function of the structure made of viscoelastic material. Since the geometry and boundary conditions are amenable in FEA compared with the experimental modal testing, this approach is not just applicable in <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> dynamic analysis, but also useful in dynamic analysis of different rubber components. The third innovative contribution of this research is connecting the multi-body analysis with continuum mechanics to evaluate the mechanical properties of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing.</b> The last innovation is the structure-thermal coupling of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> to predict its temperature distribution based on the heat source calculated from the FEA simulation. The finite volume method (FVM) is applied using MATLAB in the simulation of temperature distribution. In this research, the classical standard linear model is applied in the FEA program to characterize the variation of viscoelastic material in the frequency domain. The three parameters of this model have been identified with the batch data measurement using dynamic mechanical analysis equipment (DMA). Specially, two heat generation mechanisms are explored to emphasize the friction-induced hysteresis damping except for the commonly discussed viscous damping. As complementation of FORTRAN program simulation in the frequency domain, the multi-physics commercial software COMSOL is employed to estimate the dynamic response of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing</b> and temperature distribution in the time domain. To verify the results of FEA and multi-body dynamic approach in the dynamic and thermal analysis of <b>rubber</b> <b>bushing,</b> dynamic tests have been carried out using torsion and tensile testing machines. The experimental temperature distribution is in good agreement with the simulation results, which indicated the feasibility of the FEA method. ^ However, due to the limited experience and complicated constitutive relationship of the viscoelastic material, the standard linear viscoelastic model is chosen to simulate the heat dissipation mechanism of rubber core. The high-frequency or high-temperature dynamic testing are almost impossible because of the experiment equipments 2 ̆ 7 range of service. As the first step of predicting the dissipation energy density and temperature distribution of rubber components, the initial explorations are significant and provide a proper guidance for further predictions about life expectation. ...|$|R

Measurement of aerodynamic forces at hypersonic speed is a challenge and usually ground test facilities like shock tunnels are used to carry out such tests. Accelerometer based force balances are commonly employed for measuring aerodynamic drag around bodies in hypersonic shock tunnels. In this study, we present {{an analysis of the}} effect of model material on the performance of an accelerometer balance used for measurement of drag in impulse facilities.

This requires both the correct mechanical characterization of the materials used for inputting the required properties in the calculation code, and the specification of the different solution characteristics. In this work, two materials (polyamide and ABS) have been studied for the analysis of single disc machine. The single disc machine includes top cover and bottom cover. Where the top cover consist of motor, pulley and the provision provided for inserting the handle of the machine. The analysis of the top cover is to increase the contact force between the brush and surface. for that a mass of 12 kg is Placed on the space provide for the top cover and The structural analysis should be carried out in the top cover {{in order to reduce the}} maximum stress and deformation level within the safe limit.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a theoretical}} phase-control design strategy for idle shake affected by {{an arrangement of}} a powerplant on transversely mounted Front engine Front Wheel Drive (FWD) passenger cars. There {{are two types of}} powerplant arrangement for FWD cars heading up to the North in the top view. One of them is a typical “east-west arrangement” which allows the “front” of the engine to be placed to the right or “east”, and the “rear” of the engine that is to mate to the transmission to be placed to the left or “west” (Fig. 1). Another one is “west-east arrangement”, where the engine is positioned to “west”, and the transmission is positioned to “east” (FIG. 2). In general, a dynamic damper like a radiator supported by a <b>rubber</b> <b>bush</b> built in {{the front end of the}} engine compartment is widely believed to reduce a gain of FRF (Frequency Response Function) at resonant frequency. In addition to that, it becomes clear in this paper that the dynamic damper has an additional phase-shift effect between the two FRFs. That is to say, the two vector responses of the body vibration caused by the two excitation forces, which are the roll moment and the vertical force of the engine, cancel each other and the resultant vector becomes so small. In this manner, the powerplant arrangement affects idle shake deeply correlating with the phase-control design. A combination of the East-West arrangement and a 2 nd order balancer-less engine is the best design for idle shake of the 2 nd order harmonics. On the contrary, a combination of the West-East arrangement and a balancer-less engine is the worst design. If the engine is equipped with 2 nd order balance shafts, idle shake is estimated to be middle between them, regardless of the powerplat arrangement...|$|E
