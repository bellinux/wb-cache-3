The MQL system, developed in-house at the University of Malaya, was capable of delivering high <b>velocity</b> <b>cutting</b> fluid in narrow pulsed jet forms {{at a rate of}} 2 ml/min and a pressure of 20 MPa. The three cutting fluids chosen were neat oil, soluble oil and semi-synthetic cutting fluids. The experiments were designed to evaluate the performance of the fluids at various <b>cutting</b> <b>velocities</b> of 20, 40 and 60 m/min and feed rates of 0. 05, 0. 06 and 0. 07 mm/tooth. The results were measured in terms of the average surface roughness of the machined workpiece, the cutting forces and the maximum flank wear. In addition, the resultant chip formations were also observed. Analysis of the results has shown that in general, neat oil had performed the best in low <b>cutting</b> <b>velocities</b> and feed rates. On the other hand, soluble oil gave the lowest cutting forces and flank wears at high <b>cutting</b> <b>velocities</b> and feed rated as compared to neat oil and synthetic cutting fluid.

40|$|Hypothesis:During robotic milling of the {{temporal}} bone, forces on the cutting burr may be lowered by choice of cutting parameters. Background: Robotic bone removal systems are used in or-thopedic procedures, but they are currently not accurate enough for safe use in otologic surgery. We propose {{the use of a}} bone-attached milling robot to achieve the required accuracy and speed. To design such a robot and plan its milling trajectories, it is necessary to predict the forces that the robot must exert and withstand under likely cutting conditions. Materials and Methods: We measured forces during bone re-moval for several surgical burr types, drill angles, depths of cut, <b>cutting</b> <b>velocities,</b> and bone types (cortical/surface bone and mastoid) on human temporal bone specimens. Results: Lower forces were observed for 5 -mm diameter burrs compared with 3 -mm burrs for a given bone removal rate. Higher linear <b>cutting</b> <b>velocities</b> and greater <b>cutting</b> depths in-dependently resulted in higher forces. For combinations of velocities and depths that resulted in the same overall bone re-moval rate, lower forces were observed in parameter sets that combined higher <b>cutting</b> <b>velocities</b> and shallower depths. Lower mean forces and higher variability were observed in the mastoid compared with cortical/surface bone. Conclusion: Forces during robotic milling of {{the temporal}} bone can be predicted from the parameter sets tested in this study. This information can be used to guide the design of a suffi-ciently rigid and powerful bone-attached milling robot and to plan efficient milling trajectories. To reduce the time of the surgical intervention without creating very large forces, high linear <b>cutting</b> <b>velocities</b> may be combined with shallow depths of cut.

Furthermore, there exist many unknown matters with respect to the effects of <b>cutting</b> <b>velocity</b> on mechanism of chip formation in wood cutting. In the present experiment, cutting tests of wood with the grain were performed to obtain fundamental data on the effects of <b>cutting</b> <b>velocity</b> on chip formation, cutting force and frictional coefficient by the use an experimental appearatus for cutting tests (Fig. 1). The range of <b>cutting</b> <b>velocity</b> employed in these tests were from 0. 0023 to 52. 53 m/sec. The depth of cut (feed of tool perrevolution of a steel disk) was adjusted from 0. 3 to 0. 7 mm by varing the speed of the feed carriage in combination with two variable speed motors and somepulleys (Fig. 1). The tool used for cutting test was made of high-speed steel (SKH 2), and its sharpness angle was 25 degrees; its clearance angle was held constant at 10 degrees. Test materials used were mainly Hinki (Chamaecyparisobtusa, specific gravity in air-dry (ru) : 0. 40, moisture content (u) : 13. 0 %), Western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla, ru: 0. 38, u : 14. 3 %) and Red meranti(Shorea sp, ru : 0. 38, u: 13. 0 %); in addition to these, hinoki in water-saturated condition (u : 83 ± 5 %) was used. The main results obtained are summarized as follows : (1) Three types of chip formation were recognized throughout the entire cutting conditions employed in this test, that is,their types are continuous flow type, split type, and intermediate type (resembling continuous flow type but the chip has slight checks). Relations of these types to <b>cutting</b> <b>velocity</b> (V) at various combinations of depth of cut (t) and workpiece conditions are given in Fig. 6. (2) The curvature of the chip (o) and the checks occurring in the chip, change with V, for instance, o decreases and the pith of checks (pc) in the chip increases, with increases in V (Figs. 7 and 8). (3) Although the cutting-force components change remarkably with V, the degree of their changes depends not only on the cutting conditions but also on the workpiece conditions. For instance, in the range of very-low cutting-velocity, below about 10 m/sec, the horizontal component (FH) and the frictional force (F) of the cutting force, when cutting with air-dried workpieces, decrease remarkably with increases in V. In the range of V of about 10 ～ 30 m/sec, their components are not affected by V. In the range of V of about 30 ～ 53 m/sec, their components decreae gradually with increases in V. Compared with these, the vertical component (Fv) and the normal force (N) of the cutting force change slightly or vary little with V (Figs. 9 and 10). (4) The remarkable increase in V and the presence of a large quantity of free water reduce the friction on the interface between the tool rake face and the chip to much lower value. For instance, the frictional coefficient (μ), when cutting with water-saturated workpieces, is lower in comparison with that when cutting with air-dried workpieces, and μ, when cutting not only with water-saturated workpiecesbut also with air-dried workpieces decreases with increases in V (Fig. 12).

The results then were analyzed using statistica software. The analysis indicated that cutting speed has significant effect to the kerf width and laser cutting with air assists produced wider kerf. Result obtained also showed that laser cutting without air assists produced better cut surface quality. The feasible machining parameter of silicon is estimated at 1. 0 - 2. 0 mm/min for <b>cutting</b> <b>velocity,</b> 0. 80 - 0. 94 watt for laser power in laser cutting without air assist and 1. 0 - 4. 0 mm/min for <b>cutting</b> <b>velocity,</b> 0. 80 - 0. 90 watt for laser power in laser cutting with air assist...|$|R
