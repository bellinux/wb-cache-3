Marty Aaron, a real estate appraiser, said that while an [...] "untrained eye" [...] would [...] "wonder how Lakewood Church purchased the Compaq Center for $7.5 million, when this is not really an arms-length sale from the city to Lakewood Church." [...] Aaron explained that the church [...] "put a phenomenal amount of money into the facility after the lease was initially structured, and it's really not fair that someone else would get the benefit of that." [...] Aaron added that converting the property to a stadium-oriented facility [...] "would probably cost as much or more than it took {{to turn it into a}} church, and <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> probably not very many organizations that would be willing to step forward and do that." [...] The Houston City Council was scheduled to vote on the matter on Wednesday March 24, 2010. City council delayed the vote.

On March 31, 2010 the Houston City Council voted 13–2 to sell the property to Lakewood.|$|E
