5|$|Heterodox economists {{adhere to}} {{theories}} sufficiently {{outside the mainstream}} to be marginalized and treated as irrelevant by the establishment. Initially, heterodox economists including Joan Robinson, worked alongside mainstream economists, but heterodox groups isolated themselves and created insular groups in the late 1960s and 1970s. Present day heterodox economists often publish in their own journals <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of the mainstream and eschew formal modeling {{in favor of more}} abstract theoretical work.|$|E
5|$|Hydrochloric acid {{is used in}} methamphetamine's {{manufacturing}} process, but academic reviews {{have not}} supported {{the idea that the}} acid contributes to dental decay. Speculation that oral consumption of the drug causes tooth decay by raising the acidity of users' mouths is also unsupported. Meth mouth is generally most severe in users who inject the drug, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> who smoke, ingest or inhale it.|$|E
5|$|Parker's {{proposal}} {{was for a}} 7-bay fire station on a site {{more than double the}} size of the one proposed on Newton Street. The choice of London Road was influenced by its proximity to a development of warehouses on Whitworth Street and Princess Street. Parker convinced the city council to choose his proposals <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> on Newton Street.|$|E

5|$|The {{approach}} in these sheep experiments involves irradiating a ram’s testes while placing {{stem cells from}} a second ram into the testes of the first, ram A. In the following weeks ram A produces semen the usual way, but is using the stem cells of ram B and therefore producing semen carrying the genetics of ram B <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of his own. Ram A therefore has effectively become a surrogate ram.|$|E
5|$|Childhood and {{adolescence}} allows {{the development of}} an internal working model useful for forming attachments. This internal working model is related to the individual's state of mind which develops with respect to attachment generally and explores how attachment functions in relationship dynamics based on childhood and adolescent experience. The organization of an internal working model is generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> who rely more on the individual's state of mind alone in forming new attachments.|$|E
5|$|From 1999–2001, Western {{media reports}} on Falun Gong—and in particular, the mistreatment of practitioners—were frequent, if mixed. By {{the latter half}} of 2001, however, the volume of media reports {{declined}} precipitously, and by 2002, coverage of Falun Gong by major news organizations like the New York Times and Washington Post had almost completely ceased, particularly from within China. In a study of media discourse on Falun Gong, researcher Leeshai Lemish found that Western news organizations also became less balanced, and more likely to uncritically present the narratives of the Communist Party, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of Falun Gong or human rights groups.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{scientists}} reconstructed an endocast (replica) of an Acrocanthosaurus {{cranial cavity}} using computed tomography (CT scanning) {{to analyze the}} spaces within the holotype braincase (OMNH 10146). In life, much of this space would have been filled with the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, {{in addition to the}} brain itself. However, the general features of the brain and cranial nerves could be determined from the endocast and compared to other theropods for which endocasts have been created. While the brain is similar to many theropods, it is most similar to that of allosauroids. It most resembles the brains of Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of Allosaurus or Sinraptor, providing support for the hypothesis that Acrocanthosaurus was a carcharodontosaurid.|$|E
5|$|Many Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) {{officers}} {{were members of}} other anti-communist nationalist groups that were opposed to Diệm, such as the Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam) and the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (VNQDĐ, Vietnamese Nationalist Party), which were both established before World War II. The VNQDĐ had run a military academy in Yunnan near the Chinese border {{with the assistance of}} their nationalist Chinese counterparts, the Kuomintang. Diệm and his family had crushed all alternative anti-communist nationalists, and his politicisation of the army had alienated the servicemen. Officers were promoted on the basis of political allegiance rather than competence, meaning that many VNQDĐ and Đại Việt trained {{officers were}} denied such promotions. They felt that politically minded officers, who joined Diệm's secret Catholic-dominated Cần Lao Party, which was used to control South Vietnamese society, were rewarded with promotion <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> most capable.|$|E
5|$|The Union of Vilnius and Radom of 1401 {{confirmed}} {{the status of}} Vytautas as grand duke under Władysław's overlordship, while assuring the title of grand duke to the heirs of Władysław <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of Vytautas: should Władysław die without heirs, the Lithuanian boyars were to elect a new monarch. Since no heir had yet been produced by either monarch, {{the implications of the}} union were unforeseeable, but it forged bonds between the Polish and Lithuanian nobility and a permanent defensive alliance between the two states, strengthening Lithuania's hand for a new war against the Teutonic Order in which Poland officially took no part. While the document left the liberties of the Polish nobles untouched, it granted increased power to the boyars of Lithuania, whose grand dukes had till then been unencumbered by checks and balances of the sort attached to the Polish monarchy. The Union of Vilnius and Radom therefore earned Władysław a measure of support in Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|Ultima Underworld II {{is set in}} {{the fantasy}} world of the Ultima franchise. It takes place across {{multiple}} parallel dimensions, the first being Britannia, the traditional setting of Ultima games. The protagonist is the Avatar, the main character of the series. Chronologically, the events of the game occur directly after those of , <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of the original Ultima Underworld. As with Ultima VII, the villain of Ultima Underworld II is the Guardian, an evil being who seeks to conquer Britannia. The game features recurring characters from previous Ultima games, such as Lord British, Nystul, Dupre, Iolo and Mayor Patterson. Also present are Lady Tory and Miranda, the latter of whom appeared in Ultima VII.|$|E
5|$|After the Square Enix merger, {{however, the}} {{individual}} teams still continued to program and customize their own tools for each game, which would eventually {{go to waste}} as only their respective creators {{knew how to use}} them. With the amount of assets and tools required by the in-development Final Fantasy XII and the impending advent of the seventh console generation, a common data format for the company was proposed in 2004. It was to be developed in-house and replace general-purpose formats such as FBX and COLLADA. Realizing the goal of an engine with a common set of tools proved to be difficult, as many production teams wanted to further their own interests <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of the company as a whole. Select staff members from different company divisions teamed up to work on the project on a voluntary basis, but their loose organizational structure failed to yield results. Nevertheless, Murata considered this group effort a first step in the right direction. In 2005, he was appointed general manager of the newly formed Technology Division. Although this enabled Murata and his subordinates to talk about a company-wide engine more extensively, the lack of manpower again prevented any significant achievements.|$|E
5|$|American {{scientists}} {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, {{that they would have}} expected to find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons, the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of Maria were in the grave because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.|$|E

5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain {{of much of the}} painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then some workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> who engage in sustained thought.|$|E
