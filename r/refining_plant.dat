40|$|International audienceEven {{after its}} being phased out in {{gasoline}} {{in the late}} 90 s, lead (Pb) is still present at relatively high levels in the atmosphere of Beijing, China (0. 10 e 0. 18 mgm 3). Its origin is subject to debate as several distinct sources maycontribute to the observed pollution levels. This study proposes to constrain the origin(s) of Pb and strontium (Sr) in aerosols, by coupling both Pb and Sr isotope systematics. The characterisation of the main pollution sources (road traffic, smelters, metal <b>refining</b> <b>plants,</b> coal combustion, cement factories, and soil erosion) shows that they can unambiguously be discriminated by the multi-isotope approach (206 Pb/ 204 Pb and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr). The study of total suspended particulates (TSP) and fine particles (PM 2. 5) from Beijing and its vicinity indicates that both size fractions are controlled by the same sources. Lead isotopes indicate that metal <b>refining</b> <b>plants</b> are {{the major source of}} atmospheric lead, followed by thermal power stations and other coal combustion processes. The role of this latter source is confirmed by the study of strontium isotopes. Occasionally, emissions from cement plants and/or input from soil alteration are isotopically detectable...|$|R

25|$|Starting {{with the}} 1973–74 Arab oil embargo against the West, {{a period of}} {{prolonged}} high oil prices set in that characterised {{the rest of the}} 1970s. Romania as a major oil-producer greatly benefited from the high oil prices of the 1970s, which led Ceaușescu to embark on an ambitious plan to invest heavily in oil-refining plants. Ceaușescu's plan was to make Romania into Europe's number one oil refiner not only of its oil, but also of oil from Middle Eastern states like Iraq and Iran, and then to sell all of the refined oil at a profit on the Rotterdam spot market. As Romania lacked the money to build the necessary oil <b>refining</b> <b>plants</b> and Ceaușescu chose to spend the windfall from the high oil prices on aid to the Third World in an attempt to buy Romania international influence, Ceaușescu borrowed heavily from Western banks on the assumption that when the loans came due, the profits from the sales of the refined oil would be more than enough to pay off the loans. A major problem with Ceaușescu's oil-refining plan which led to Romania taking enormous loans was the low productivity of Romanian workers, which meant that the oil-refining plants were finished years behind schedule. The 1977 earthquake which destroyed much of Bucharest also led to delays in the oil plan. By the time the oil <b>refining</b> <b>plants</b> were finished in the early 1980s, a slump in oil prices had set in, leading to major financial problems for Romania.|$|R

40|$|Human {{exposure}} biomonitoring in the African Copperbelt (Katanga, southern D. R. Congo) revealed elevated cobalt (Co) {{exposure in}} the general population. This {{study was designed to}} identify the Co exposure routes for the non-occupationally exposed population in that area. The concentration of Co was measured in environmental and urine samples collected in urban and rural communities close to metal mining and/or <b>refining</b> <b>plants,</b> villages near a lake receiving effluents from metal <b>refining</b> <b>plants,</b> and control rural areas without industrial pollution. Drinking water, uncooked food items (maize flour, washed vegetables, fish and meat), indoor and outdoor dust samples were collected at each location. A food questionnaire was used to estimate dietary Co intake for adults and children. Geometric mean urine-Co (U-Co) concentrations were 4. 5 -fold (adults) and 6. 6 -fold (children) higher in the polluted than in the control area, with U-Co values being intermediate in the lakeside area. Average Co concentrations in environmental samples differed 6 - 40 -fold between these areas. U-Co was positively correlated with most environmental Co concentrations, the highest correlations being found with Co in drinking water, vegetables and fruit. Estimated average total Co intake for adults was 63 (± 42) μg/day in the control area, 94 (± 55) μg/day in the lakeside villages and 570 (± 100) μg Co/day in the polluted areas. U-Co was significantly related to modelled Co intake (R(2) = 0. 48, adults and R(2) = 0. 47, children; log-log relationship). Consumption of legumes, i. e. sweet potato leaves (polluted) and cereals+fish (lakeside) was the largest contributor to Co intake in adults, whereas dust ingestion appeared to contribute substantially in children in the polluted area. In conclusion, dietary Co is the main source of Co exposure in the polluted area and Co is efficiently transferred from soil and water in the human food chain. status: publishe...|$|R
