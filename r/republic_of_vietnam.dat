5|$|In 1973, by {{the time}} the Paris Peace Accord was concluded, South Vietnam possessed the fourth largest air force in the world. Despite their size, however, <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> Air Force {{operations}} were severely curtailed due to cutbacks in U.S. military aid. Furthermore, the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> Air Force were prevented from undertaking reconnaissance and ground support missions due to the threat posed by formidable anti-aircraft weapons deployed by North Vietnam. When the North Vietnamese military renewed their offensive early in 1975, the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> Air Force was virtually handicapped and many of their aircraft were either lost or captured as formations of the Vietnam People's Army swept through the Central Highlands of South Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} Trung {{took off}} again and flew out to Phước Long Province, which {{was occupied by}} the Provisional Revolutionary Government since North Vietnamese troops had captured it earlier in the year, and he was warmly received by North Vietnamese soldiers.

In 1963 Trung's father was killed and his body was mutilated by the South Vietnamese police.

5|$|Although the Paris Peace Accords of 1973 were {{supposed}} {{to end the war}} in Vietnam, fighting continued between South Vietnam and North Vietnam and the Viet Cong.

The change of religion was widely perceived to be a factor in his rapid promotion above more capable officers. A devout member of the Catholic minority, Diệm dedicated the country to the Virgin Mary and heavily disenfranchised and disadvantaged the Buddhist majority.|$|E

5|$|Known as Double Seven Day, July 7 was {{the ninth}} anniversary of Diệm's 1954 {{ascension}} to Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam.

5|$|North Vietnam {{continued}} {{to build up}} its combat units in South Vietnam. With the threat of U.S. airpower removed, the North Vietnamese military moved anti-aircraft units into South Vietnam, and deployed a sophisticated air-defence network that included the long-range SA-2 surface-to-air missile system, radar-guided anti-aircraft guns and the SA-7 Grail shoulder-launched missile The strong presence of North Vietnamese anti-aircraft units, which covered much of the northern provinces of South Vietnam, forced <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> Air Force reconnaissance and fighter aircraft to fly at higher altitudes to avoid being hit by surface-to-air missiles. Consequently, when North Vietnam went on the offensive again in 1975, the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> Air Force was severely handicapped.|$|E
