In this study {{the potential of}} material recovery to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was assessed. The study was divided into two phases. In the first phase the material recovery concepts used in Finland were identified and approximate greenhouse gas emission savings calculations were conducted {{for some of the}} concepts. In the second phase two promising concepts were chosen as case studies for a more detailed assessment, both of which are documented in detail in this report. In the first concept plastic waste is reprocessed into plastic profiles and in the second waste textile is reprocessed into oil absorbent mats. Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) methodology was used for calculating the greenhouse gas emission savings. The emission saving potential was assessed by comparing the emissions from the product made of recycled material with the emissions from the lifecycle of a <b>reference</b> <b>product.</b> The <b>reference</b> <b>product</b> is made for the same application of use but manufactured from virgin raw material. Impregnated wood was chosen as the <b>reference</b> <b>product</b> for the plastic profile and oil absorbent mat made from virgin polypropylene fibre was used as the <b>reference</b> <b>product</b> for the oil absorbent mat made from textile waste. When assessing the overall greenhouse gas emission savings from material recovery, only comparing the emissions from the recycled and the <b>reference</b> <b>product</b> lifecycles is insufficient. Thus, the emissions avoided by material and energy recovery were also included in the calculations. The results show that the greenhouse gas emission reduction potential of material recycling is highly case-specific and emission savings can not always be obtained. In this study recovery of textile waste showed the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, plastic waste recycling only generates greenhouse gas emission savings under certain conditions. The emission reduction potential greatly depends on the <b>reference</b> <b>product</b> chosen. This study concentrated solely on greenhouse gas emissions.

The second guidance entitled “Quality Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Protein Product” provides an overview of analytical factors to consider when assessing biosimilarity between a proposed therapeutic protein <b>product</b> and a <b>reference</b> <b>product</b> {{for the purpose of}} submitting a 351 (k) application.

40|$|The Author(s) 2015. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Biosimilars {{are required to}} be similar or highly similar in structure to their biologic <b>reference</b> <b>product</b> but are neither expected nor required to contain identical active substances. For example, glycosylated biosimilars approved to date demonstrate quantitative and qualitative structural differences from their <b>reference</b> <b>product</b> and exemplify the latitude of variations permitted for biosimi-lars. Although differences between a candidate biosimilar and its <b>reference</b> <b>product</b> will be evaluated for differential clinical effects during biosimilarity assessment, it is unli-kely that potential differences between any two indirectly related biosimilars will be formally evaluated. Further-more, biosimilar pathways permit variations in pharma-ceutical attributes, clinical development approaches, and regulatory outcomes, resulting in further diversity of attributes among approved biosimilars. Because biosimi-lars may vary across the ranges of structural and functional acceptance criteria, {{they should not be}} treated like multi-source, generic drugs. Key Points Although biosimilars are highly similar to their <b>reference</b> <b>products,</b> they are not identical to them. Regulatory pathways permit slight differences in structural and other product quality attributes of biosimilars; such difference are unlikely to be formally evaluated among indirectly related biosimilars, resulting in a potential for a broader range of potential differences in quality attributes among approved biosimilars. Policies and practices related to the identification and use of biosimilars should take into account potential molecular differences among multiple biosimilars of the same <b>reference</b> <b>product</b> and should not treat them like generics. Specific recommendations to distinguish biologics from generic drugs in practice include ensuring that all biologics have distinguishable names and are prescribed by a distinguishable name, that a clinician is involved in decisions to switch among non-interchangeable biologics, and that patient medical records track biologics by their distinguishable names. ...|$|R
