40|$|Purpose: This {{research}} was aimed to formulate and characterize a microemolsion systems as a topical delivery system of naproxen for relief of symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis {{and treatment of}} dysmenorrheal. Methods: ME formulations prepared by mixing of appropriate amount of surfactant including Tween 80 and Span 80, co-surfactant such as propylene glycol (PG) and oil phase including Labrafac PG –transcutol P (10 : 1 ratio). The prepared microemolsions were evaluated regarding their particle size, zeta potential, conductivity, stability, viscosity, differential scanningcalorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), <b>refractory</b> <b>index</b> (RI) and pH. Results: The mean droplets size of microemulsion formulation were {{in the range of}} 7. 03 to 79. 8 nm, and its <b>refractory</b> <b>index</b> (RI) and pH were 1. 45 and 6. 75, respectively. Viscosity range was 253. 73 - 802. 63 cps. Drug release profile showed that 26. 15 % of thedrug released in the first 24 hours of experiment. Also, Hexagonal and bicontinuous structures were seen in the SEM photograph of the microemulsions. Conclusion: characterization, physicochemical properties and in vitro release were dependent upon the contents of S/C ratio, water and, oil phase percentage in formulations. Also, ME- 6 may be preferable for topical naproxen formulation...|$|E

40|$|In present work, we {{theoretically}} {{study the}} electron wave's focusing phenomenon {{in a single}} layered graphene pn junction(PNJ) and obtain the electric current density distribution of graphene PNJ, which is in good agreement with the qualitative result in previous numerical calculations [Science, 315, 1252 (2007) ]. In addition, we find that for symmetric PNJ, 1 / 4 of total electric current radiated from source electrode can be collected by drain electrode. Furthermore, this ratio reduces to 3 / 16 in a symmetric graphene npn junction. Our results obtained by present analytical method provide a general design rule for electric lens based on negative <b>refractory</b> <b>index</b> systems. Comment: 13 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|Quackenbush {{strain and}} wild Mus musculus were assayed for their {{liability}} to primary infection with 100 L 3 Nematospiroides dubius using an experimentally derived selection <b>index.</b> <b>Refractory</b> and liable colonies of mice were established over 5 generations. Liability to N. dubius infection was found {{likely to be}} controlled by several genes; the heritability (h 2) of this trait was estimated at 0 – 45. Positive linear correlation was found between the number of parasite eggs voided and the number of adult N. dubius recovered, negative correlation between the pre-patent period of infection in days and the number of parasite eggs voided and positive correlation in 2 of 5 generations between live mouse body weight and the number of adult N. dubius recovered. Further, positive correlation was found between the liability of female mice to N. dubius and their progeny litter size number. The genetic mechanisms controlling the liability trait and the possible evolutionary significance of these results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Objective Methylmalonic acidemia {{is one of}} the inborn {{errors of}} {{metabolism}} resulting in the accumulation of acylcarnitine in blood and increased urinary methylmalonic acid excretion. This disorder can have symptoms, such as neurological and gastrointestinal manifestations, lethargy, and anorexia. Materials & Methods The patients who were diagnosed as methylmalonic acidemia in the Neurology Department of Mofid Children’s Hospital in Tehran, Iran, between 2002 and 2012 were included in our study. The disorder was confirmed by clinical findings, neuroimaging findings, and neurometabolic and genetic assessment in reference laboratory in Germany. We assessed the age, gender, past medical history, developmental status, clinical manifestations, and neuroimaging findings of 20 patients with methylmalonic acidemia. Results Eighty percent of the patients were offspring of consanguineous marriages. Half of the patients had Failure to thrive (FTT) due to anorexia; 85 % had history of developmental delay or regression, and 20 % had refractory seizure, which all of them were controlled. The patients with methylmalonic acidemia were followed for approximately 5 years and the follow-up showed that the patients with early diagnosis had a more favorable clinical response in growth <b>index,</b> <b>refractory</b> seizure, anorexia, and neurodevelopmental delay. Neuroimaging findings included brain atrophy, basal ganglia involvement (often in putamen), and periventricular leukomalacia. Conclusion According to the results of this study, we suggest that early assessment and diagnosis have {{an important role in the}} prevention of disease progression and clinical signs...|$|R
40|$|The {{thickness}} and {{refractive index}} of thin films determines their performance. Thickness variation {{due to the}} deposition process is well understood and correctable. Variation in the refractive index due to the deposition process is a considerably more complex problem. In this work two important {{members of the class}} of high <b>index</b> <b>refractory</b> materials: Tantalum pentoxide and Titania are investigated. These materials are known to produce very high quality films. Ion plating of tantalum results in the extremely high quality films, but ion plating of titania results in films with absorption that is too high and the process is now no longer used. Ion assisted deposition of titania, however, results in high quality films. The variation in refractive index due to the columnar microstructure of these materials has been eliminated but the subtler aspects of the thin films behavior is more difficult to improve. It is this aspect that I have investigated. In particular what improvements can be made by post deposition annealing of ion plated and ion assisted deposition of Tantalum pentoxide, and can the ion bombardment of Titania result in films with increased birefringence. If this anisotropy can be increased a number of interesting polarizing elements can be produced. These investigations were performed in distinct methods. The absorption of these films required the design and construction of a specialized highly sensitive waveguide apparatus. The investigation of anisotropy involved examining the evolution of form birefringence in situ by polarimetry. A further parameter of interest, although not as yet widely studied in thin films as the effects are small and difficult to observe is material nonlinearity. In the future the design of dynamic filters or coatings for powerful laser systems will require a good means of determining this kind of behavior in thin films. To this end we have designed our absorption instrument to be able to determine changes in refractive index due to a strong external pump beam. These effects are described in chapter three as an indication of future trends in this area...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} is to reveal the relationship between speed of light and {{the density of the}} medium that the light is travelling through. This relationship was able to be found by directing a laser beam to a glass container bearing water, and then measuring the angle of refraction between the ray that is refracted after entering the medium and the normal axis. The speed of light travelling in vacuum(c) is a physical constant, so the change in the index of refraction of the medium would mean that the speed of light changed while travelling within the water. The basic procedure followed was to determine the <b>refractory</b> <b>index</b> of water under various values of densities, and to conclude the investigation by the data harvested during the investigation with the help of Snell’s Law and the definition of the <b>refractory</b> <b>index.</b> As the index of refraction of a substance and the speed of light travelling through it are inversely proportional quantities, a relationship between the speed of light propagating through water and its density was able to be uncovered as can be infered from the graphs. The investigation has indicated that the density of water and the speed of light travelling through it are inversely proportional quantities. Thus, {{this investigation}} was able to show that density is one of the factors that can affect the speed of light travelling in a particular environment. Although the index of refraction of a particular medium is essentially related with the temperature of the medium and the wavelength of the light directed at it, this experiment has showed that the density of the environment {{is also one of the}} variables capable of altering the speed of light...|$|E
40|$|The {{symmetric}} hydrido-spiro-λ 5 -phosphane {{derived from}} anhydroerythritol (meso-oxolane- 3, 4 -diol, AnEryt), HP(AnErytH− 2) 2 (3), was prepared by two different syn-thetic protocols. One route involves a three step synthesis starting from phos-phorus trichloride via 2 -chloro-tetrahydro-furo[3, 4 -d][1, 3, 2]dioxaphosphole (1) and diethyl-(tetrahydro-furo[3, 4 -d][1, 3, 2]dioxaphosphol- 2 -yl) -amine (2) as intermedi-ates. The first intermediate, P(AnErytH− 2) Cl (1), was isolated as a crystalline solid and its structure {{was determined by}} single crystal X-ray diffraction. 1 is the first example of a halogeno substituted phosphane derived from an aliphatic diol whose molecular structure in the solid state was determined by X-ray diffraction stud-ies. Alternatively, the title compound can also be obtained in a one-pot procedure starting from tris(N,N-dimethylamino) phosphane. All new compounds were char-acterized by their physical constants (melting point, <b>refractory</b> <b>index),</b> NMR, IR, Raman, UV/VIS, mass spectrometry, as well as elemental analysis.

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to formulate and evaluate a new microemulsion (ME) for topical delivery of griseofulvin. Methods: The solubilities of griseofulvin in different combinations of surfactant to co-surfactant (S/Co ratio) were determined. Accordingly, based on their phase diagrams, eight microemulsions were formulated and then evaluated with respect to their particle size, surface tension, viscosity, conductivity, zeta potential and stability. Their release behavior, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), <b>refractory</b> <b>index</b> (RI), pH and Small-angle-X-ray scattering (SAXS) were also assessed. Results: The results indicated that the mean droplet size of the MEs ranged from 30. 9 to 84. 3 nm. Their zeta potential varied from - 4. 5 to - 20. 8. Other determined characteristics were viscosity: 254 - 381 cps, pH: 5. 34 - 6. 57, surface tension: 41. 16 - 42. 83 dyne. cm- 1, conductivity: 0. 0442 – 0. 111 ms. cm- 1. The drug release was in the range of 22. 4 to 43. 69 percent. Also, hexagonal, cubic and lamellar liquid crystals were observed in SAXS experiments. Conclusion: It can be concluded that any alteration in MEs constituents directly affects their microstructure, shape, droplet size and their other physicochemical properties...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{identify}} through {{case study}} the presentation and possible pathophysiological cause of complex regional pain syndrome and its preferential response to stellate ganglion blockade. SettingComplex regional pain syndrome {{can occur in}} an extremity after minor injury, fracture, surgery, peripheral nerve insult or spontaneously and is characterised by spontaneous pain, changes in skin temperature and colour, oedema, and motor disturbances. Pathophysiology is likely to involve peripheral and central components and neurological and inflammatory elements. There is no consistent approach to treatment {{with a wide variety}} of specialists involved. Diagnosis can be difficult, with over-diagnosis resulting from undue emphasis placed upon pain disproportionate to an inciting event despite the absence of other symptoms or under-diagnosed when subtle symptoms are not recognised. The International Association for the Study of Pain supports the use of sympathetic blocks to reduce sympathetic nervous system overactivity and relieve complex regional pain symptoms. Educational reviews promote stellate ganglion blockade as beneficial. Three blocks were given at 8, 10 and 13 months after the initial injury under local anaesthesia and sterile conditions. Physiotherapeutic input was delivered under block conditions to maximise joint and tissue mobility and facilitate restoration of function. ConclusionThis case demonstrates the need for practitioners from all disciplines to be able to identify the clinical characteristics of complex regional pain syndrome to instigate immediate treatment and supports the notion that stellate ganglion blockade is preferable to upper limb intravenous regional anaesthetic block for <b>refractory</b> <b>index</b> finger pain associated with complex regional pain syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Hypothesis: The primary {{hypothesis}} of this thesis {{is that the}} refractory period in asthma is due to release of bronchoprotective mediator(s) within the airway and that these may be {{one or more of}} the pro-resolving lipid mediators such as lipoxins or resolvins. Methods: 1. Development of a LC-MS assay for the detection of pro-resolving mediators in sputum. 2. Development of an in vitro airway model using porcine and human bronchial rings. 3. A clinical study of mannitol-induced refractoriness with collection of urine and sputum to assess changes in prostaglandin and pro-resolving mediator levels. Key Results: 1. Approximate LC-MS limits of detection were 0. 002, 0. 01 and 0. 04 pg/μl for PGE 2, LXA 4 and RvD 1 respectively. These LOD compare favourably with ELISA. 2. Serial LC-MS analysis of spiked sputum samples showed that LXA 4 appeared stable, while PGE 2 and RvD 1 showed some degradation over 5 months. 3. LXA 4, RvD 1 and MaR 1 had no significant effect on the histamine response of porcine bronchial rings. 4. Bronchoconstriction with high concentration mannitol rendered an airway refractory to further contraction with direct ASM agonists via an unknown mechanism. 5. In human bronchial rings, neither 10 nM LXA 4 nor 10 nM MaR 1 had any effect on bronchoconstriction induced by mast cell FcμR 1 activation. 6. In the clinical study, with bolus dosing the mean <b>refractory</b> <b>index</b> for mannitol was 24...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present research was to produce monoclonal antibodies (MCAs) against the USDA challenge strain of infectious laryngotracheitis virus and to perform an initial investigation of their use in an indirect immunofluorescence diagnostic test. Fourteen-day old chicken embryo liver cells were grown in tissue culture plates. Confluent monolayers were obtained after 48 hours. Monolayers were infected with the USDA challenge strain of infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV). Cytopethic effect of the virus {{in the form of}} syncytial formation and clumping of cells was observed after 24 hours. The virus from the tissue culture flasks was collected and purified using discontinuous sucrose gradient. A clear band of the virus from sucrose gradient was obtained. The <b>refractory</b> <b>index</b> and the density measured were 1. 410 and 1. 20 g/cm 3, respectively. Spectrophotometry of the purified virus showed 68. 117 ug/ml of protein and 9. 8948 ug/ml of nucleic acid concentration. Spleen cells from immunized mice with pure virus were fused with myeloma cells and hybridomas were obtained after 10 days. Screening was performed using indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) using rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins as secondary antibodies. Three hybridomas, 2 D 1 D 8, 2 E 11 G 2 and 2 C 6 C 7 were found producing antibodies against ILTV. All monoclonal antibodies were of isotype IgM and reacted with different strains of ILTV (ILTV USDA, S 88 00224, 86 - 1169) in IFAT. None of the monoclonals reacted with Parrot herpesvirus and avian adenovirus 301 in IFAT...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] A {{number of}} studies have {{suggested}} that diurnal variation in airways responsiveness underlies the circadian rhythm of ventilatory function in asthma. Measurements of airways responsiveness are therefore often performed at standardised times in order to avoid this possible effect, but this is not practical for epidemiological studies. Refractoriness to methacholine has also been reported and this, too, could confound the results of methacholine tests repeated over short intervals. This investigation was carried out to evaluate the possible magnitude of diurnal variation and refractoriness in repeated measures of airways responsiveness to methacholine. METHODS [...] To investigate diurnal variation in airways responsiveness, 24 asthmatic subjects aged 18 - 45 underwent five methacholine tests over three days which were not necessarily consecutive: day 1 at 08 : 00 hours; day 2 at 08 : 00 hours, 14 : 00 hours, 20 : 00 hours; day 3 at 20 : 00 hours. To investigate refractoriness a retrospective analysis was undertaken of all paired methacholine tests performed in individuals within our unit between 1984 and 1990 where there had been no intervention likely to affect the results. RESULTS [...] The first investigation revealed no diurnal change in airways responsiveness although there was a change in FEV 1. Mean PD 20 did, however, increase 1. 57 fold from 08 : 00 hours on day 1 to 08 : 00 hours on day 2 for subjects studied on consecutive days. The second investigation confirmed that a test interval of up to 24 hours (but not of 48 or more hours) was associated with a <b>refractory</b> <b>index</b> (PD 20 test 2 /PD 20 test 1) of > 1. CONCLUSIONS [...] No diurnal variation in airways responsiveness was detected for measurements made between 08 : 00 hours and 20 : 00 hours, but an interval between successive tests of up to 24 hours was associated with refractoriness. Diurnal variation is not likely to exert an important confounding effect on methacholine tests carried out between 08 : 00 hours and 20 : 00 hours, but confounding could result from refractoriness if tests are repeated at intervals up to 24 hours...|$|E
