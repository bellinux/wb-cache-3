40|$|The Joint Force Protection Advanced Security System (JPFASS) is a Department of Defense {{effort to}} improve {{conventional}} force protection. It is sponsored and managed by Joint Program Manager- Guardian (JPM-G). The main objective of JFPASS is to provide an integrated and layered base defense system, which includes data fusion, Command and Control (C 2) nodes, Common Operation Picture (COP) nodes, and full integration of a selected range of robots, sensors, cameras, weapons, tracking systems, and other C 2 systems. The URIM is the main integration tool for several sensors, cameras, and weapons in JFPASS. The Universal <b>Resource</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Module</b> (URIM) is an extremely flexible framework for rapidly integrating new sensors into the JFPASS. Each sensor system has its own proprietary protocol, which makes integration high cost and risk. The URIM communicates directly with each sensor system though a protocol module and maintains a generic data object representation for each sensor. The URIM then performs a translation of the data into a single protocol, in this case Systems Engineering and Integration Working Group (SEIWG) ICD- 0100. With this common protocol the data can be provided to a data server for publishing. Also, this allows for network control and management of all sensor systems via any C 2 node connected to the data server...|$|E
3000|$|The generic {{design is}} {{composed}} of in silico <b>interface</b> <b>modules,</b> interconnection modules, and in vivo <b>interface</b> <b>modules.</b> The in vivo <b>interface</b> <b>modules</b> allow the system {{to interact with the}} data acquisition systems. The in silico <b>interface</b> <b>modules</b> allow the system to interact with the BMM, set the execution configuration parameters, and provide tools for model optimization and data analysis. The interconnection modules manage the information exchange between the in vivo and in silico <b>interface</b> <b>modules.</b> The design has three data flows. First, data collected from the subject via data acquisition hardware flows into the system through the in vivo <b>interface</b> <b>modules.</b> The interconnection modules then process and send this data to the in silico <b>interface</b> <b>modules,</b> where the data is fed as input to the BMM simulator. In the second data flow, simulation results are fed back into the system via the in silico <b>interface</b> and interconnection <b>modules</b> and are used to control a prosthetic device through the in vivo <b>interface</b> <b>modules.</b> The third data flow propagates the user configuration data to other modules in the design. The user configuration may include some important parameters for the interconnection of in vivo experiments and BMMs, such as the data transmission protocol and data processing options. Though the proposed design deals with interfacing to physical prosthetic devices [10], its integration into the framework is considered future work.
