The thesis is separated into several parts, in the first chapter I use general characteristic of negotiable instruments for the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange. In the second chapter I briefly discuss relations <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange, {{because we have to}} pay attention not only to the essentials but also to other terms <b>of</b> drawing the <b>bill.</b> In the third chapter I deal with the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange and promissory note and their essentials. The difference between the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange and the promissory note is an unconditional order to pay a determinate sum of money by drawer to drawee, which is characteristic for the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange; whereas the promissory note is characterized by an unconditional promise to pay a determinate sum of money by drawer. The rest of essentials, except for the name of drawee logically, are the same. These essential are the term "bill of exchange" incorporated in the body <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange in the same language as a text <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange, maturity, place of payment, name of payee, place and date <b>of</b> drawing a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange and signature of drawer.
