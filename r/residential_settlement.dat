5|$|Carrick Post Office {{opened on}} 5 November 1841. Carrick never grew large—the {{population}} varied from around 200 to 439—and {{today it is}} largely a <b>residential</b> <b>settlement</b> for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town. During much of its history growth has been limited by lack of organised water supply and sewerage, though reticulated services for both are now connected. Volunteer labour enabled piped water supply, from the Liffey, from 1961 and a sewerage plant {{was built in the}} mid-1970s on the towns outskirts. The local councils' strategic plan aims for the town to stay small with only infill development.|$|E
5|$|Carrick {{is a small}} {{historic}} {{village that}} is primarily a <b>residential</b> <b>settlement</b> for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town. Development has been slow and has not changed the town's original 19th century character. The local council's development plan aims to restrict development along Meander Valley road and prevent the merging of Carrick and Hadspen, keeping them as distinct centres. Construction is only planned within the town's boundary, where up to sixty homes could potentially be built under the strategic plan that runs until 2016. The town's development boundary is dictated by the span of sewerage connection. There are few businesses in the town and little incentive for business growth due to the town's small population. The town is in the Meander Valley Council local government area, the Federal Division of Lyons, and the State Division of Lyons.|$|E
25|$|Not much {{is known}} about Duncraig before the <b>residential</b> <b>settlement</b> boom - the {{majority}} {{of land in the}} area remained largely undeveloped until the 1960s. In 1969, the name Duncraig was approved, and was first used as a promotional name. It is of Scottish origin.|$|E

25|$|By the 1860s, the city, with {{an area of}} {{only one}} square kilometer, was already overcrowded. Thus began the {{construction}} of the New City, the part of Jerusalem outside of the city walls. Seeking new areas to stake their claims, the Russian Orthodox Church began constructing a complex, now known as the Russian Compound, a few hundred meters from Jaffa Gate. The first attempt at <b>residential</b> <b>settlement</b> outside the walls of Jerusalem was undertaken by Jews, who built a small complex on the hill overlooking Zion Gate, across the Valley of Hinnom. This settlement, known as Mishkenot Sha'ananim, eventually flourished and set the precedent for other new communities to spring up to the west and north of the Old City. In time, as the communities grew and connected geographically, this became known as the New City.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, Ford {{initiated}} the Belize River Archaeological Settlement Survey, or BRASS, project {{in order to}} better examine the settlement patterns and cultural ecology of the Maya region. In the course of that survey she and her team discovered the ancient Maya city, El Pilar. In the following years the BRASS team excavated many sites from under the forest canopy. From 1983 to 1989, Ford and her team focused on the <b>residential</b> <b>settlement</b> patterns of the El Pilar area. From 1990 to 1992, Ford and her team focused on the full-scale excavation of representative residential of the El Pilar area. Investigations that began in 1993 at El Pilar resulted in detailed maps and site chronology for the monuments. Now that El Pilar is protected in Belize and Guatemala, and destined to be a peace park, current field research is focused on mapping the residential component of El Pilar, identifying undiscovered sites and monuments. The team has worked with Lidar since 2013, field protocol funded by National Geographic, which led to the discovery of The Citadel, a hilltop temple complex.|$|E

2500|$|Since 2003, state {{officials}} and researchers have concluded the likely site of Werowocomoco is further west along the York River at Purtan Bay. [...] There archeologists have {{found evidence of}} a large <b>residential</b> <b>settlement</b> dating to 1200, with major earthworks built about 1400. They have found extensive artifacts, including European goods, which indicate likely interaction with the English in the early 17th century. In 2006 the Werowocomoco Archeological Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Excavations continue by a team headed by the College of William and Mary.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided in two parts; The First {{part is the}} {{physical}} analysis of <b>residential</b> <b>settlements</b> in the Eastern Coast of Maracaibo Lake, Venezuela. The work is based on surveys, evaluations and comparisons of four identifiable housing systems of the area which are Old settlements, Oil Company Housing, Squatter Settlements and Public Housing. The physical environment {{of each of these}} is analyzed in terms of land utilization/circulation efficiency and level of services. Based on {{the first part of the}} study a model is proposed for a residential area of El Menito New Town which is planned to be constructed in the surrounding area. The criterion followed to establish the layout for the model are explained/drawn as design guidelines. Finally, a comparative evaluation of the model and the analyzed <b>residential</b> <b>settlements</b> is made to show how the model achieves a consistent efficiency in land utilization/circulation efficiency. by Humberto Jose Rodriguez Navas.

25|$|The {{area and}} its environs are {{important}} not only in naturalistic terms, but also anthropologically and historically; research has highlighted a number of human settlements scattered between Barche di Solferino and Bande di Cavriana, Castellaro and Isolone del Mincio. These dated, without interruption, from Neolithic times (5th–4th millennium BC) to the Bronze Age (2nd–1st millennium BC) and the Gallic phases (2nd–1st centuries BC), and ended with Roman <b>residential</b> <b>settlements,</b> which could {{be traced to the}} 3rdcentury AD.|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of urban sprawl {{has been studied}} extensively. Most research so far has focused on <b>residential</b> <b>settlements.</b> A growing {{number of studies have}} addressed industrial deconcentration. Our focus in this paper is on logistics sprawl, i. e. the growth and suburban relocation of warehousing activities. Specifically, we investigate the difference in logistics sprawl between monocentric and polycentric systems of cities. The literature suggests that logistics activities, like <b>residential</b> <b>settlements,</b> will gradually move to suburbs as land prices increase in central areas. As research for logistics has mostly focused on monocentric systems, the question is whether this also applies to polycentric systems. We compare two cases, the Paris region in France, representative of a monocentric development, and the Dutch Randstad area as a polycentric case. We use regional statistics on warehouse settlements in both regions for a descriptive analysis of changes since the mid 2000 s to derive metrics for concentration. The cases show different patterns of change in concentration. In contrast to Paris, logistics activities within the Randstad have intensified in dense areas. We explore the reasons that may explain this difference and conclude that urban structure, spatial planning policies and the freight hub quality of a region are factors of influence...|$|R

40|$|The Costa Blanca in the {{province}} of Alicante (Spain) represents an emblematic example of suburban development around Mediterranean medium-sized cities, with the existence {{of a wide range of}} <b>residential</b> <b>settlements</b> devoted both to the native population and foreign-born groups. Condominiums, gated communities and single-family housing have few facilities and inadequate space for outdoor activities related to leisure and recreation. Such settlements are characterized by a fluctuation in population which increases in the summer, fostered by the high demand for sun, sand and sea tourism. At the same time, they display a lack of vibrant public spaces and a narrow range of accommodation options and activities. Urban sociability, understood as social opportunities afforded by space characteristics, is highly dependent on physical features such as variety in space, diversity of housing types and configuration of urban activities. The aim of this study is to analyze these aforementioned factors in two predominantly <b>residential</b> <b>settlements,</b> i. e., Gran Alacant and La Marina-Oasis. Our research indicates a likely relationship among the following urban features in terms of whether or not they promote social life: the existing number and location of activities (retail, facilities and residential tourism related services), the distribution and diversity of dwellings, and the configuration of open spaces. Each of the aforementioned urban features is analyzed in order to understand how they may contribute to sociability...|$|R
