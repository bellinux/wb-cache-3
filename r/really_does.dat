5|$|Amira and Anthony's {{relationship}} continues {{and after}} having a small argument with Christian Clarke (John Partridge), Amira goes over to Anthony's house and the pair end up having sex for the first time. However, she later cries afterwards and appears to regret it. She tells him it felt wrong, {{but it is not}} his fault. She then decides to leave Walford without telling him. Anthony later learns that Amira has left after Syed tells him. When Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) takes a liking to Anthony, her father Derek forces Anthony to take her out. Anthony is not interested in Alice, but is scared of Derek so cannot refuse. They have a couple of dates, but they go badly. Several weeks later, Alice receives flowers and assumes they are from Anthony. Anthony is then forced to take her out again, as {{he does not want to}} upset her.

5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he <b>really</b> <b>does</b> love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem {{lies in the fact that}} every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E

25|$|In Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, Oedipus, {{the king}} of Thebes, calls upon Tiresias {{to aid in the}} {{investigation}} of the killing of the previous king Laius. At first, Tiresias refuses to give a direct answer and instead hints that the killer is someone Oedipus <b>really</b> <b>does</b> not wish to find. However, after being provoked to anger by Oedipus' accusation first that he has no foresight and then that Tiresias had a hand in the murder, he reveals that in fact it was Oedipus himself who had (unwittingly) committed the crime. Outraged, Oedipus throws him out of the palace, but then afterwards realizes the truth.|$|E

At just under 300 {{feet long and}} five storeys high, she is the largest artifact in the collection. As the city of St. Thomas is landlocked, HMCS Ojibwa is located in Port Burwell, Ontario on Lake Erie. The submarine left Halifax, Nova Scotia in May 2012, arriving at Port Burwell in November that year with public tours beginning {{in the summer of}} 2013. http://www.hmcsojibwa.ca/. The Elgin Military Museum was the proud recipient of both the provincial and national tourism awards for the tours at HMCS Ojibwa after its first year of operation.

25|$|Brent tells Neil {{that he has}} a {{date for}} the Christmas party, when he <b>really</b> <b>does</b> not. With Gareth's help, he {{searches}} Internet romance websites for suitable women, and lines up three possible candidates for blind dates. He takes the first to dinner, but accidentally steers the conversation to breasts. He calls from his car to arrange a meeting with the second woman (voiced by Julia Davis), who does not realise who Brent is, and mocks the manager from The Office documentary. Brent hangs up. On the third date, Brent immediately finds the woman unattractive and boring. Dawn returns to Britain and arrives at the office. She and Tim immediately recreate old times by winding up Gareth. Brent pushes Neil's patience too far when he brings his dog into the office to show to the staff. Neil bars Brent from the office and later stops anyone who does not work for Wernham Hogg from going to the Christmas dinner. At the party, Brent anxiously awaits his fourth blind date. When the woman, Carol, arrives, she and Brent hit it off straight away. Lee tells Dawn {{that it is time to}} leave. She and Tim say awkward goodbyes and she leaves with Lee.|$|E

In 1909, Kanō {{incorporated}} the Kodokan, and endowed it with ¥10,000 (then about U.S. $4,700). The reason, said Japan Times on 30 March 1913, was [...] "so that this wonderful institution might be able to reconstruct, for that is what it <b>really</b> <b>does,</b> the moral and physical nature of the Japanese youth, without its founder's personal attention." ...|$|E

And you know, just the way I would sing it versus in the way Toni Braxton would sing it.

500|$|Offering similar {{equipment}} {{levels to}} the SV6, the Commodore SS uses the 6.0-litre V8 engine and T-56 six-speed manual transmission. The SS is recognisable from its quad exhaust outlets {{in place of}} the SV6 dual outlets. The resulting specification level is much higher than the outgoing minimalist SV8 and only missing a few cosmetic touches of the previous flagship Commodore SS. Since its release, the SS has won two consecutive (2006 and 2007) Bang For Your Bucks awards, a Motor magazine initiative. The judges gave preference to the SS the second-time-round because [...] "the VE Commodore SS <b>really</b> <b>does</b> represent the biggest bang you'll ever get for your bucks like these." ...|$|E

Jaffe said of his final version of the character, that while [...] " [...] may not totally feel at home in Ancient Greece from a costume standpoint, I think he achieves the greater purpose which is to give players a character who they can play who <b>really</b> <b>does</b> just let them go nuts and unleash the nasty fantasies that they have in their head." ...|$|E
