40|$|Motivated by {{the former}} {{researchers}} who focus only {{on one of the}} factor <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible investments, this study analyzes factors <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible investments. This study investigates wether cash, equity, expense and income are <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible investments. The reasons why the issue becomes a crucial matter are: First, recent accounting and finance literature say that intangible assets are a firm value creator and increasingly becoming the major drivers of firm value and performance. Second, current financial statements provide very little information about these assets. Even worse, much of the information that is provided is partial, inconsistent, and confusing. Third, intangible assets empirical studies in Indonesia are still very limited. Using sample from manufacture firms listed at the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) over 2003 - 2007, the result indicates that generally cash, equity, expense and income are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets. These findings have twelve main concerns: First, unexpected cash are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets but statistically insignificant. Second, the increasing unexpected cash are negatively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically insignificant. Third, the decreasing unexpected cash are negatively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically insignificant. Fourth, unexpected equity are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically significant. Fifth, the increasing unexpected equity are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically significant. Sixth, the decreasing unexpected equity are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets but statistically insignificant. Seventh, unexpected expense are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically significant. Eighth, the increasing unexpected expense are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically significant. Ninth, the decreasing unexpected expense are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets but statistically insignificant. Tenth, unexpected income are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets but statistically insignificant. Eleventh, the increasing unexpected income are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets and statistically significant. Twelfth, the decreasing unexpected income are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible assets but statistically insignificant...|$|R
