40|$|The noise {{generated}} by supersonic-tip-speed propellers creates a cabin noise problem for future airplanes powered by these propellers. Noise {{of a number}} of propeller models were measured in the NASA Lewis 8 - by 6 -Foot Wind Tunnel with flow parallel to the propeller <b>axis.</b> <b>In</b> <b>flight,</b> {{as a result of the}} induced upwash from the airplane wing, the propeller is at an angle of attack with respect to the incoming flow. Therefore, the 10 -blade SR- 6 propeller was operated at angle of attack to determine its noise behavior. Higher blade passage tones were observed for the propeller operating at angle of attack in a 0. 6 axial Mach number flow. The noise increase was not symmetrical, with one wall of the wind tunnel showing a larger noise increase than the other wall. No noise increase was observed at angle of attack in a 0. 8 axial Mach number flow. For this propeller the dominance of thickness noise, which does not increase with angle of attack, explains the lack of noise increase at the higher 0. 8 Mach number...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{theoretical}} {{investigations of}} steady curvilinear flight did not afford a suitable criterion of "maneuverability," {{which is very}} important for judging combat, sport and stunt-flying airplanes. The idea of rolling ability, i. e., of the speed of rotation of the airplane about its X <b>axis</b> <b>in</b> rectilinear <b>flight</b> at constant speed and for a constant, suddenly produced deflection of the ailerons, is introduced and tested under simplified assumptions for the air-force distribution over the span. This leads to the following conclusions: the effect of the moment of inertia about the X axis is negligibly small, since the speed of rotation very quickly reaches a uniform value...|$|R
40|$|Granular gases as dilute {{ensembles}} {{of particles}} in random motion {{are not only}} at the basis of elementary structure-forming processes in the universe and involved in many industrial and natural phenomena, but also excellent models to study fundamental statistical dynamics. A vast number of theoretical and numerical investigations have dealt with this apparently simple non-equilibrium system. The essential difference to molecular gases is the energy dissipation in particle collisions, a subtle distinction with immense impact on their global dynamics. Its most striking manifestation is the so-called granular cooling, the gradual loss of mechanical energy in absence of external excitation. We report an experimental study of homogeneous cooling of three-dimensional (3 D) granular gases in microgravity. Surprisingly, the asymptotic scaling E(t) ∝ t^- 2 obtained by Haff's minimal model [J. Fluid Mech. 134, 401 (1983) ] proves to be robust, despite the violation of several of its central assumptions. The shape anisotropy of the grains influences the characteristic time of energy loss quantitatively, but not qualitatively. We compare kinetic energies in the individual degrees of freedom, and find a slight predominance of the translational motions. In addition, we detect a certain preference of the grains to align with their long <b>axis</b> <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> direction, a feature known from active matter or animal flocks, and the onset of clustering...|$|R
5000|$|The {{cyclogyro}} wing {{resembles a}} paddle wheel, with airfoils replacing the paddles. The airfoils' pitch (angle of attack) is adjusted either collectively (by {{means of a}} control ring with links to all blades, which is located eccentrically and variably relative to the rotor's axis of rotation) or the blades are individually adjustable in pitch and are adjusted continually by the control system as they move around the rotor's <b>axis.</b> <b>In</b> normal forward <b>flight</b> the airfoils are given a slight positive pitch at the upper and forward portions of their arc, producing lift and forward thrust. They are given flat or negative pitch at the bottom, and are [...] "flat" [...] {{through the rest of}} the circle to produce little or no lift in other directions. The pitch can be adjusted to change the thrust profile, allowing the cyclogyro to travel in any direction. Differential thrust between the two wings (one on either side of the fuselage) can be used to turn the aircraft around its vertical axis, although conventional tail surfaces are generally used as well.|$|R
40|$|The Northern Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) is {{a species}} with {{conspicuous}} courtship rituals, the most noticeable part being the males' aerobatic song-flight. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine which song-flight characteristics are important in female mate choice and whether the perceived difficulty of the song-flight is correlated with other indicators of male quality. In 2014 and 2015 male lapwings were observed in the meadows and arable land in South Bohemia, Czech Republic, in the vicinity of České Budějovice, a traditional breeding area. In 24 males we video-recorded their song-flights and observed mating behaviour and/or incubation of nests, had they any. We measured various aspects of the most dramatic displays of agility and stamina in the song-flight (Ascent, Vertical Dive, and Alternating <b>Flight)</b> <b>in</b> order to find which of them acted as influencing factors in female mate choice. We found that the more complicated the pirouette in the Vertical Dive and the faster the pace of the Alternating Flight, the earlier the male nested. The most convincing result showed that the longer the male spent more or less vertically inclined along his longitudinal <b>axis</b> <b>in</b> the Alternating <b>Flight</b> on one side before revolving to the other, the higher the probability for him to establish a polygynous bond - attract more [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a reconfigurable Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) controller for the Boeing 747 - 100 / 200 longitudinal <b>axis</b> <b>in</b> the Up-and-Away <b>flight</b> regime. The control objectives are to obtain decoupled flight-path angle and velocity command tracking and achieve good disturbance rejection characteristics during normal operation and in the presence of an elevator fault. The LPV controller is synthesized using a quasi-LPV model of the aircraft longitudinal axis based on Jacobian Linearizations. The controller schedules on three parameters: flight altitude and velocity, which are available as measurements, and a fault identification signal generated by a fault detection and isolation (FDI) algorithm. During normal flight operations, the LPV controller uses the elevators and thrust for ight maneuvers. The stabilizer is only used to trim the aircraft. Three elevator fault scenarios are contemplated - loss-in-effectiveness, lock and float. The proposed control strategy uses the stabilizer (normally used for trim purposes only) as the alternative longitudinal control surface. Simulation results with elevator hydraulic failures in a real accident scenario show that the reconfigurable controller stabilizes the faulted system with a pre-designed reduction in the tracking responsiveness. The reconfigured LPV controller also exhibits good disturbance rejection properties...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{badminton}} shuttlecock has {{the smallest}} ballistic coefficient and exhibits the largest in-flight deceleration of any airborne sporting implement. In the present study, measurements of aerodynamic forces are performed at high Reynolds numbers, {{and the effect}} of shuttlecock deformation on aerodynamic properties was also investigated. A shuttlecock skirt has an array of diverging stems, whose ends are at the convergent end of the skirt, joined together in an end-ring. Furthermore, the shuttlecock rotates about shuttlecock's major <b>axis</b> <b>in</b> actual <b>flight,</b> and the experiments are performed by the shuttlecocks with and without rotation (spin). The effect of the flow passing through the gap between slots (stiffeners) located at leg portion of the shuttlecock skirt on aerodynamic characteristics is also demonstrated by using no-gap shuttlecock model, which is completely covered with cellophane tape. The free rotation rate of a shuttlecock increases with increasing Reynolds number, and the drag coefficient gradually decreases over Re= 86000 for the shuttlecock with no rotation. On the other hand, the drag coefficient for the shuttlecock with rotation is almost constant over the whole range of Reynolds number in the present study because the deformation of shuttlecock skirt for the shuttlecock with rotation becomes smaller than that for the shuttlecock with no rotation. However, there is no significant difference in drag coefficient between the shuttlecocks with and without rotation in contrast to the difference in drag coefficient between the shuttlecocks with and without gap. The drag coefficient for the shuttlecock with no gap is significantly smaller than that for the ordinary shuttlecock (with gap). For an ordinary shuttlecock, the air flows through the gap in the shuttlecock skirt, and this flow is related to high aerodynamic drag...|$|R

40|$|Avian flight cannot fail to impress; {{from the}} huge migratory {{distances}} covered by albatrosses to the dexterity shown by a feeding hummingbird, {{the performance of}} birds <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> is remarkable. Until now research into free flight (i. e. not in a wind tunnel or other artificial environment) has been limited to observations from the ground. Here I use a collection of novel techniques, based {{on the use of}} onboard instrumentation carried by the bird, to explore if and how this performance might be underpinned by their flexible <b>flight</b> configuration. <b>In</b> the Introduction (chapter 1) to the thesis I investigate previous work into the stability and control of birds <b>in</b> <b>flight.</b> <b>In</b> chapter 2 I investigate a selection of manoeuvres seen commonly <b>in</b> <b>flight,</b> and describe {{the ways in which they}} exploit the flexible configuration of the eagle. Then (chapter 3), using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) containing an integrated camera and Pilot-tube I measure the forces acting on the body of the bird <b>in</b> <b>flight,</b> the airspeed of the bird, and using custom-written software, I extract the configuration of the tail from the video. Using the measured configuration of the tail I estimate the lift generated by the tail according to a series of simple aerodynamic models. These are good predictors of the variation in the normal load factor acting on the bird. This suggests that the tail of the eagle is used primarily <b>in</b> soaring <b>flight</b> to balance the bird along the pitch <b>axis.</b> <b>In</b> chapter 4 I further investigate the configuration of the tail, I find that the spread and angle of attack of the tail covary, but that the twist of the tail is adjusted independently. In chapter 5 I explore one manoeuvre, the wing tuck, in more detail. With reference to a 'mean wing tuck' of the key variables I suggest that it is a response to a drop in wing loading, which suggests that it may be a response to atmospheric turbulence. I then investigate the frequency of wing tucking and our principal finding is that it is increased on days when the wind speed is greater, further suggesting that it is a response to atmospheric turbulence. Finally in the Discussion (chapter 6) I summarise the thesis. I also consider future avenues for research into the control and stability of avian flight and discuss some of the limitations of the methods used in this thesis.
