50|$|None of {{the teams}} relegated from the Premiership the {{previous}} season <b>regained</b> <b>their</b> top division status in 1999, although First Division champions Sunderland <b>regained</b> <b>their</b> Premiership place after a two-year exile. The other two relegation places went to long-term absentees from the top division. Playoff winners Watford <b>regained</b> <b>their</b> top division place after an absence of 11 years, but runners-up Bradford had been outside of the top division for 77 years. These two promotion winners surprised the observers {{more than any other}} Division One side during 1998-99.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the player}} can use {{firearms}} to kill monsters, Resident Evil emphasizes evasion over fast-paced combat {{by providing the}} player with limited ammunition. The player has {{a limited amount of}} health which decreases when attacked by monsters. Nevertheless, players can <b>regain</b> <b>their</b> health by collecting and using herbs, which can be mixed with other herbs to increase their healing effect. Some monsters can also infect the player with a poisoning effect, which gradually depletes the player's health over time until the poison is cured with serum or special herbs. Zombies that are defeated but not decapitated or burned eventually revive and mutate into much deadlier opponents.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} many Christians {{performed}} daring feats to rescue captives from Seringapatnam {{and take them}} to places of safety. A captive named Domingo Pinto (brother of Salvador Pinto, who rose to high rank in the services of Tipu), was particularly proficient in this. He rescued many people and took them secretly to Mangalore or Tellicherry. He proposed that those anxious to <b>regain</b> <b>their</b> liberty could be rescued on payment to him of a certain sum of money. He fixed the rescue price per captive at 8 hoons (Rs. 32) for a male, and 4 hoons (Rs. 16) for a female.|$|E

5|$|Meermin {{set sail}} from Madagascar on 20 January 1766, {{heading to the}} Cape Colony. Two days into the trip, Johann Godfried Krause, the ship's chief merchant, persuaded the captain, Gerrit Cristoffel Muller, to release the Malagasy slaves from their {{shackles}} and thus avoid attrition by death and disease in their overcrowded living conditions. The Malagasy were put to working the ship and entertaining the crew. In mid-February, Krause ordered the Malagasy to clean some Madagascan weapons, which they subsequently used to seize the ship {{in an attempt to}} <b>regain</b> <b>their</b> freedom; Krause was among the first of the crew to be killed, and Muller was stabbed three times but survived.|$|E

After Domino's return, the team began a scripted rivalry with Batista and Ric Flair. On the August 31 episode of SmackDown!, he and Domino lost their tag team title to Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Matt Hardy. They engaged in a rivalry with MVP and Hardy, and attempted to <b>regain</b> <b>their</b> championship, but were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The gun {{law in the}} Czech Republic {{is quite}} liberal. It is mostly caused {{by the fact that}} after the fall of {{communist}} regime people wanted to <b>regain</b> <b>their</b> rights {{to keep and bear arms}} and these needs resulted in passing quite liberal legislation in 1995, which surpassed the previous restrictive communist enactment. The law became widely accepted and led to quite massive civilian arming. Especially many businessmen felt the actual need to obtain a firearm because the times shortly after the Velvet Revolution are known for the rise in organized crime often related to the economic transformation in the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|The {{reintegration}} of French prisoners into {{civilian life}} was facilitated by {{a network of}} Maisons du Prisonnier (Prisoner Houses), established across France, which would help them readjust and find work. Generally, prisoners generally found it easy to <b>regain</b> <b>their</b> pre-war jobs because of the shortage of labour. The government had hoped that returning prisoners of war would be more sympathetic to the Vichy regime, but prisoners coming back were not noticeably more loyal to Vichy than other groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{two works}} are bound {{together}} in one surviving manuscript, the earliest surviving cartulary from medieval England. A major theme is the losses suffered by Worcester {{at the hands of}} royal officials and local landowners. Included amongst the despoilers are kings such as Cnut and William the Conqueror, and nobles such as Eadric Streona and Urse d'Abetot. Also included are accounts of lawsuits waged by the Worcester monks in an effort to <b>regain</b> <b>their</b> lost lands. The two sections of the cartulary were first printed in 1723. The original manuscript was slightly damaged by fire in 1733, and required rebinding. A new printed edition is in production as of 2010.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Black Christians have {{identified}} themselves spiritually with the Children of Israel. In the late 19th century, {{some of them}} also began to claim {{that they were the}} biological descendants of the Israelites. This identification with the Israelites was a response to the sociopolitical realities of their situation in the United States, including slavery and racial discrimination. For African-Americans, appropriating Jewish history was part of a rebellion against the American racial hierarchy that deemed Africans inferior. It was also a means of fulfilling their desire to know their origins and <b>regain</b> <b>their</b> lost history.|$|E

5|$|A One Day International (ODI) is a cricket {{match between}} two {{representative}} teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by}} the International Cricket Council (ICC). The first ODI was played between Australia and England on January 5, 1971. The United States (U.S.) played its first ODI under the captaincy of Richard Staple at the Kennington Oval, London on September 10, 2004 against New Zealand. This match occurred during the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, which took place from September 10 to 25. The U.S. played a total of two matches during this tournament and lost both, failing to qualify for the semifinals. Since that tournament, the United States has not played any more ODIs as they have failed to <b>regain</b> <b>their</b> ODI status.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, Meridian {{was home}} to a Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) office and several other activist organizations. James Chaney and other local residents, along with Michael Schwerner, his wife Rita, and Andrew Goodman, volunteers from New York City, worked to create a {{community}} center. They held classes during Freedom Summer to help prepare African Americans {{in the area to}} prepare to <b>regain</b> <b>their</b> constitutional franchise, after having been excluded from politics since disenfranchisement in 1890. Whites in the area resented the activism, and physically attacked civil rights workers. In June 1964, Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman went to Neshoba County, Mississippi, to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned. The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian. Following a massive FBI investigation, their murdered bodies were found two months later, buried in an earthen dam.|$|E
5|$|Justice David Souter wrote a dissenting opinion, {{which was}} joined by Justice Antonin Scalia. Souter {{referenced}} prior cases dealing with sovereignty and jurisdiction, from the decision made in United States v. Kagama, to the opinion made in South Dakota v. Bourland. Souter stated that the decision in this case did not align with precedent established in previous cases. Since Duro held that the tribes had lost their inherent sovereignty, {{the only way for}} the tribes to regain jurisdiction over non-member Indians would be by the delegation of that jurisdiction by Congress. Bourland was even more specific as to that point. Souter believed that the only two ways that the tribes could <b>regain</b> <b>their</b> sovereignty would be for Congress to declare that they were independent of the United States, as it did with the Philippines, or for the Court to overturn the concept of a dependent domestic sovereign.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool F.C. {{were formed}} in 1892, {{following}} a rent {{dispute between the}} leaseholder of Anfield, John Houlding, and Everton Football Club, which left Houlding with a ground but no club playing in it. In their first season Liverpool won the Lancashire League, and were elected to the Football League Second Division for the 1893–94 season, going {{on to win the}} title without losing a match. Their first season in the First Division ended in relegation, before they were promoted back the following season. Liverpool won the First Division {{for the first time in}} the 1900–01 season, and reached their first FA Cup Final in 1914, losing 1–0 to Burnley. They won their first back-to-back titles in the 1921–22 and 1922–23 seasons; this was their last success until the 1946–47 season, when they regained the league title. Relegated in the 1953–54 season, they did not <b>regain</b> <b>their</b> place in the First Division until the 1962–63 season under the management of Bill Shankly.|$|E
5|$|Mohini plays {{a lesser}} {{role in a}} Shaiva legend in the Skanda Purana. Here, Vishnu as Mohini joins Shiva to teach a lesson to arrogant sages. A group of sages are {{performing}} rituals in a forest, and start to consider themselves as gods. To humble them, Shiva {{takes the form of}} an attractive young beggar (Bhikshatana) and Vishnu becomes Mohini, his wife. While the sages fall for Mohini, their women wildly chase Shiva. When they <b>regain</b> <b>their</b> senses, they perform a black magic sacrifice, which produces a serpent, a lion, an elephant (or tiger) and a dwarf, all of which are overpowered by Shiva. Shiva then dances on the dwarf and takes the form of Nataraja, the cosmic dancer. The legend is retold in the Tamil Kovil Puranam and Kandha Puranam with some variation. This legend is also told in the Sthala Purana related to the Chidambaram Temple dedicated to Shiva-Nataraja.|$|E
5|$|On December 7, 1982, Kassar {{announced}} that Atari's revenue forecasts for 1982 were {{cut from a}} 50 percent increase over 1981, down to a 15 percent increase. Immediately following the announcement, Warner Communications' stock value dropped by around 35 percent—from US$54 to US$35—resulting in the company losing US$1.3billion in market valuation. Kassar sold five thousand of his Warner shares a half-hour before the announcement. This prompted an investigation for insider trading against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Atari attempted to <b>regain</b> <b>their</b> market share by licensing popular arcade games for the Atari consoles. The games, however, did not reverse Atari's decline and they went further into debt. In 1983, the company had decreased its workforce by 30 percent and lost US$356million. Other companies—Activision, Bally Manufacturing, and Mattel—experienced similar results as the industry declined.|$|E
