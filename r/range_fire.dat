5|$|After the war, the Australian Army {{moved away}} from the machine gun {{battalion}} concept and no similar units were raised. The machine gun role was subsumed into the support companies of individual infantry battalions. The idea was arguably misunderstood by Australian commanders throughout the war and this may have influenced the decision {{to move away from the}} concept. When the units had been established, the intent had been for machine gun battalions to provide highly mobile fire support but this only worked where the principles of open warfare worked. Once the focus of Australian Army combat operations shifted to the Pacific, the machine gun battalions were largely misused, being employed in a static defensive capacity against short and medium range targets or for menial tasks, rather than as offensive weapons for long <b>range</b> <b>fire</b> support. The medium machine guns were also largely used in the same manner as light machine guns, such as the Bren. Other reasons identified for the concept's limited use include distrust of overhead fire by some commanders, a preference for organic fire support over attached sub-units, over-estimating the difficulty of transporting Vickers guns in the jungle and a tendency to ignore targets that could not be seen. The difficulties of target acquisition in dense jungle also contributed.|$|E

25|$|Construction of the {{new ship}} began in 1877. Mars was {{launched}} on 15 November 1879 at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven. After fitting-out work was completed, she was commissioned for sea trials on 1 March 1881. She was the first gunnery training ship built for the German navy. At the time, training was rather crude, with one test per year for each ship of the fleet, and the tests consisted of firing at targets 500, 1,500, and 2,500meters (550, 1,640, and 2,730yards) away. This would begin to be remedied only in 1885, when August von Thomsen was appointed the chief gunner for the fleet, {{and he began to}} improve the training regimen, particularly with regards to longer <b>range</b> <b>fire.</b> Mars completed her trials quickly, and was assigned to the North Sea Naval Station, though she was technically {{under the control of the}} gunnery officers at the Kaiserliche Admiralität (Imperial Admiralty). She began gunnery training in April 1881 in the Schillig roadstead just outside Wilhelmshaven. On 26 April, one of the 21cm shells exploded aboard the ship, killing nine men and wounding another eighteen. At the end of the year, she returned to the inner harbor at Wilhelmshaven, where she remained for the winter.|$|E

500|$|The game {{contains}} weapons {{based on}} non-fictional firearms, such as pistols, assault rifles, and submachine guns, {{as well as}} entirely fictional armaments like particle beam weapons. Each firearm differs in terms of ammunition type, accuracy, <b>range,</b> <b>fire</b> rate, damage, and bulkiness. The latter characteristic is crucial, as more powerful/specialized weapons {{tend to be more}} cumbersome and slow the player's maneuvers. Unlike other games of the genre where lighter/smaller weapons tend to be useless, F.E.A.R. does not scale guns on a curve, so any firearm is potentially deadly in most situations. Monolith Productions stated that it aimed for [...] "... a balanced arsenal where each weapon serves a specific function", rather than [...] "... just going with a bunch of real-world submachine guns and assault rifles." [...] F.E.A.R.s heads-up display crosshair's size dynamically shows where shots will fall based on movement, aim, and the weapon in use. The player may carry only three firearms at a time; thus, strategy is required when using and selecting weapons.|$|E
500|$|When {{they had}} been formed, it was {{intended}} that the machine gun battalions would provide highly mobile fire support; however, Phillip Hocking, author of The Long Carry, highlights that throughout the war {{the utility of the}} machine gun battalions was largely misunderstood by commanders, particularly after the focus of the Australian Army's operations shifted to the Pacific. Some commanders used the machine guns largely in a static defensive capacity against short and medium range targets, rather than as offensive fire support weapons that could be employed to provide long <b>range</b> <b>fire</b> support. The medium machine guns were also largely utilised {{in the same manner as}} light machine guns, such as the Bren. Other reasons identified for the concept's limited use include distrust of overhead fire by some commanders, a preference for organic fire support over attached sub-units, over-estimating [...] the difficulty of transporting Vickers guns in the jungle, and a tendency to ignore targets that could not be seen. After their disbandment, the machine gun battalion concept was not used in the post-war Australian Army, as the function became nested within the structure of a standard infantry battalion.|$|E

500|$|The ship of {{the line}} {{exchanged}} signals with the frigates as Centurion began to fire, and as the signals were different from those used by the Royal Navy, Phillips was certain he was facing an overwhelming enemy squadron. Centurion made urgent signals to the Indiamen, warning them of the approaching threat. The crew of Barnaby panicked and cut her anchor cables, causing her to drift on shore where she was wrecked. Captain John Logan on Princess Charlotte was calmer and remained at anchor, although he ignored requests from Phillips for assistance from his ship's gun battery. Linois's ships spread out, Atalante closing to within [...] of Centurion, with Sémillante close behind. Marengo remained out of range, as Linois was unwilling to risk his flagship in shallow coastal waters for {{which he did not}} have accurate charts: the approaches to Vizagapatam were protected by a series of sandbars and if Marengo grounded during the engagement then his flagship could have been wrecked. When the French frigates came within , Phillips opened fire on Atalante as Sémillante attempted to reach {{the other side of the}} British ship to batter from the other side. The French frigates also came under long <b>range</b> <b>fire</b> from the three-gun battery at Vizagapatam, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Campbell, on detached service from the 74th Regiment of Foot. Campbell [...] despatched 50 sepoys in small boats to assist the crew of Princess Charlotte, whose armament of 24 guns continued to remain silent.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} {{hours of the}} Somme Offensive, Rees was on patrol, taking off in Airco DH.2 No. 6015 at 0555 hours. His attempt to join a {{formation}} of [...] "British" [...] machines brought an attack {{from one of the}} Germans. He shot up the attacker, hitting its fuselage between the two aircrew. As it dived away, Rees attacked a Roland. Long <b>range</b> <b>fire</b> from three other Germans did not discourage Rees from closing on it; it emitted a hazy cloud of smoke from its engine from the 30 rounds Rees fired into it and it fled. Rees then single handedly went after five more Germans. A bullet in the thigh paralysed his leg, forcing him to temporarily break off his assault. As the shock of the wound wore off, he was able to pursue the German formation leader, which was leaving after dropping its bomb. He fired his Lewis machine gun empty. In frustration, he drew his pistol but dropped it into his DH.2's nacelle. Meanwhile, the German two-seater pulled away above him. The German formation was shattered and scattered.|$|E

2500|$|Initially {{isolated}} by the British {{strike at}} the centre and rear of the combined fleet's line, Neptuno was ordered to hug the wind to allow the other ships {{to get to their}} stations. Neptuno was fired upon by the 64-gun , which had arrived late to the battle and sailed southwards parallel down the line, exchanging broadsides with the ships of the fleet. Africas long <b>range</b> <b>fire</b> caused little damage. At 2 pm Dumanoir brought the van around and headed south to support the beleaguered centre, trying to fight his way through to Villeneuve's flagship, the 80-gun Bucentaure. With Dumanoir in the attempt were Neptuno and four French ships, the 80-gun Formidable, and the 74-gun ships Scipion, Duguay-Trouin and the Mont-Blanc. Neptuno fought her way through to Bucentaure, with Valdés hoping to use her boats to recapture the flagship. The plan came to nothing when he discovered the boats had been destroyed by gunfire.

2500|$|German {{batteries}} {{were unsuccessful}} engaging ships of the Task Force, in that ships holed and bracketed with near misses were not sunk; the maneuvering ships {{were able to}} maintain positions in mineswept lanes for the most part, and countermeasures included use of smoke, jamming German radar and effective counter battery fires. Nevertheless, U.S. naval doctrine was modified after the operation. More {{attention was paid to}} the achievement of effective long <b>range</b> <b>fire.</b> According to Admiral Bertram Ramsay, Naval Commander in Chief of the Allied Naval Expeditionary Force, if the German gunners had not been hampered by faulty ammunition, [...] "they might well have inflicted heavy damage to .....ships at the relatively close range ..." [...] Prior to June 1944, the United States Navy's main experiences in the war had been in the Mediterranean and the Pacific. According to naval historian Samuel Morison, these experiences had resulted in an assumption that the modern fire control systems on U.S. ships allowed them to close with and defeat coastal batteries at will. But in the Mediterranean the shore batteries had not been [...] "well and resolutely" [...] served, and Japanese coastal defense gunners had been inadequately trained. As a result of the Cherbourg operation, Morison concluded that, even with modern directors for naval gunnery, a casemated gun is [...] "exceedingly difficult for a rapidly maneuvering warship to destroy with a direct hit, although a shower of salvos around the coast defense position will silence the guns temporarily." [...] Deyo's after-action report recommended that long-range bombardment with plane spotting would be required to silence casemated batteries, stating that either good air spot or shore parties are required for effective naval bombardment, especially when strong currents add to the navigational problems of a task force under accurate shore battery fire.|$|E

60|$|It {{became evident}} {{now that there}} was not much chance of {{overtaking}} {{the main body of the}} burghers, and an attempt was therefore made to interpose a fresh force who might head them off. A line of posts existed between Thabanchu and Ladybrand, and Colonel Thorneycroft was stationed there with a movable column. It was Knox's plan therefore to prevent the Boers from breaking to the west and to head them towards the Basuto border. A small column under Parsons had been sent by Hunter from Bloemfontein, and pushed in upon the flank of De Wet, who had on the 12th got back to Dewetsdorp. Again the pursuit became warm, but De Wet's time was not yet come. He headed for Springhaan Nek, about fifteen miles east of Thabanchu. This pass is about four miles broad, with a British fort upon either side of it. There was only one way to safety, for Knox's mounted infantrymen and lancers were already dotting the southern skyline. Without hesitation the whole Boer force, now some 2500 strong, galloped at full speed in open order through the Nek, braving the long <b>range</b> <b>fire</b> of riflemen and guns. The tactics were those of French in his ride to Kimberley, and the success was as complete. De Wet's force passed through the last barrier which had been held against him, and vanished into the mountainous country round Ficksburg, where it could safely rest and refit.|$|E
