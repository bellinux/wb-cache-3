40|$|Attribute {{reduction}} {{is one of}} the most important topics in rough set theory. Heuristic attribute reduction algorithms have been presented to solve the attribute reduction problem. It is generally known that fitness functions play a key role in developing heuristic attribute reduction algorithms. The monotonicity of fitness functions can guarantee the validity of heuristic attribute reduction algorithms. In probabilistic rough set model, distribution <b>reducts</b> can ensure the decision rules derived from the <b>reducts</b> are compatible with those derived from the original decision table. However, there are few studies on developing heuristic attribute reduction algorithms for finding distribution <b>reducts.</b> This is partly due to the fact that there are no monotonic fitness functions that are used to design heuristic attribute reduction algorithms in probabilistic rough set model. The main objective of this paper is to develop heuristic attribute reduction algorithms for finding distribution <b>reducts</b> in probabilistic rough set model. For one thing, two monotonic fitness functions are constructed, from which equivalence definitions of distribution <b>reducts</b> can be obtained. For another, two modified monotonic fitness functions are proposed to evaluate the significance of attributes more effectively. On this basis, two heuristic attribute reduction algorithms for finding distribution <b>reducts</b> are developed based on addition-deletion method and deletion method. In particular, the monotonicity of fitness functions guarantees the rationality of the proposed heuristic attribute reduction algorithms. Results of experimental analysis are included to quantify the effectiveness of the proposed fitness functions and distribution <b>reducts.</b> Comment: 44 pages, 24 figure...|$|R

This work {{is part of a}} long line of {{research}} studying <b>reducts</b> of first order structures, or dually extensions of closed-subgroups of S∞. Most of the research so far has focused on the ω-cateorical case where the two points of view (group or structure) are equivalent: a countable ω-categorical structure is determined up to bi-interpretability by its topological automorphism group G < S ∞ and its <b>reducts</b> are in one-to-one correspondence with closed subgroups of S ∞ containing G [AZ 86]. The full classification of <b>reducts</b> is known for a number of ω-categorical structures ([Cam 76, Tho 91, Tho 96, BP 11]). Nevertheless, the main question asked by Thomas over 20 years ago remains unresolved: we do not know if every homogeneous structure on a finite relational language has only finitely many <b>reducts.</b> In an other direction, Junker and Ziegler [JZ 08] asked for a converse to that question: if a structure is not ω-categorical, does it necessarily have infinitely many <b>reducts.</b> One has to beware when considering non ω-categorical structures that there are now two natural notions of <b>reducts.</b> Let M be a countable structure in a language L and let GM < S ∞ be its automorphism group. ...|$|R
