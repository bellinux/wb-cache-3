50|$|After the war, Regina grew as a {{regional}} distribution centre for farming and <b>rural</b> <b>activity.</b> Not until the 1970s did the economy begin to shift from agri-base to industrial-based activity, although agriculture continues to dominate {{the economy of the}} city and province. In 1971, Jack Walker, a former RCAF bomber pilot, real estate developer and city alderman, took control of the industrial development of the city and began to diversify the local economy by encouraging light industrial business. In 1973 Deere & Co International selected Regina as the western distribution centre for all John Deere equipment. This vote of confidence in the young city combined with the expansion of the Consumers' Co-operative Refinery and the development of the Inter-Provincial Steel Co. (Ipsco) plant began to lessen the city's dependence on agriculture-related employment. Today Regina's economy is quite diversified, with strong activity in the resource, financial and telecommunications sectors.|$|E
5000|$|Unarmed fox {{hunting on}} horseback with hounds {{is the type}} of hunting most closely {{associated}} with the United Kingdom; in fact, [...] "hunting" [...] without qualification implies fox hunting. What in other countries is called [...] "hunting" [...] is called [...] "shooting" [...] (birds) or [...] "stalking" [...] (deer) in Britain. Originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock, fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in Victorian times and a traditional <b>rural</b> <b>activity</b> for riders and foot followers alike. Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds. Pairs of Sight hounds (or long-dogs), such as greyhounds, may be used to pursue a hare in coursing, where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare (but are not intended to actually catch it), or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers. Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags (deer) or mink. Deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds, using stealth.|$|E
50|$|Evidence of Gallo-Roman {{habitation}} can be {{seen from}} the air, featuring overlapping enclosures and a big farm building or villa.Human remains and three tombs dating back to the Merovingian era have been discovered within the commune boundaries.In the early Middle Ages, vines were cultivated in Picardie, and in this region in particular, as testified at Salouël by the parcel of land known as ‘Les Vignettes’.In 1342 a fulling mill was in use on the river Selle, to process woollen cloth, which had previously been done manually.Originally, Salouël was part of the parish town of Saleux. The separation was made by imperial decree on December 11, 1864.Its cantonal allocation has changed since 1790: first integrated into the canton of Bovelles, then to Sains and since 1879 the canton of Boves.With Salouël being so close to Amiens, it wasn’t just involved in <b>rural</b> <b>activity</b> over the centuries, unlike most of the surrounding communes. Since the Middle Ages, the development of craft industries and small workshops occupied most of the population.After the Second World War, and in particular since the years 1965-1970 the commune has been transformed by the successive establishment of the campus of a University and a large hospital.|$|E

5000|$|The CPC Central Committee, {{hiding in}} Shanghai, {{expelled}} Mao from their ranks {{and from the}} Hunan Provincial Committee, as punishment for his [...] "military opportunism", for his focus on <b>rural</b> <b>activity,</b> and for being too lenient with [...] "bad gentry". They nevertheless adopted three policies he had long championed: the immediate formation of Workers' councils, the confiscation of all land without exemption, and {{the rejection of the}} KMT. Mao's response was to ignore them. He established a base in Jinggangshan City, an area of the Jinggang Mountains, where he united five villages as a self-governing state, and supported the confiscation of land from rich landlords, who were [...] "re-educated" [...] and sometimes executed. He ensured that no massacres took place in the region, and pursued a more lenient approach than that advocated by the Central Committee. He proclaimed that [...] "Even the lame, the deaf and the blind could all come in useful for the revolutionary struggle", he boosted the army's numbers, incorporating two groups of bandits into his army, building a force of around [...] troops. He laid down rules for his soldiers: prompt obedience to orders, all confiscations were to {{be turned over to the}} government, and nothing was to be confiscated from poorer peasants. In doing so, he molded his men into a disciplined, efficient fighting force.|$|E
5000|$|Tom Clough (1881-1964), {{known as}} 'The Prince of Pipers', was an English {{player of the}} Northumbrian pipes, or Northumbrian smallpipes. He was also a pipemaker, and the pipes he made with Fred Picknell include several {{important}} innovations, and have a distinctive tone. He had studied the instrument with the noted piper Thomas Todd, and from his own father Henry Clough. His three surviving recordings, among the earliest recordings made of the instrument, and his considerable body of music manuscripts, including his own compositions, give considerable insight into the traditional playing technique and style of the instrument. This is particularly so because at least four previous generations of the family had been pipers, as was his son 'Young Tom' (1912-1987) - they thus form a continuous link between earliest players of the modern instrument, and contemporary players. In contrast to the widely accepted notion of traditional folk music as an essentially <b>rural</b> <b>activity,</b> {{he and his family}} lived in the mining community of Newsham in south-east Northumberland, and were miners themselves. At the end of his life, 'Young Tom' recalled piping sessions at the 'Willow Tree' in Newsham, with his father Tom, grandfather Henry Clough, and Richard Mowat all playing - Henry's and Richard Mowat's playing would get more furious and inaccurate as the evening progressed; Tom was teetotal. Young Tom had the job of carrying his grandfather's pipes afterwards. There is a composite photograph of the Clough family at. Here Tom himself is on the left, his pipemaking collaborator Fred Picknell standing behind him, his father Henry Clough and son 'Young Tom' standing towards the right, while an older image of Tom's grandfather 'Old Tom', seated piping in the foreground, has been added subsequently. Old Tom died in 1885, and the main photograph was taken in 1924. The other figure, seated on the far right, is believed to be Captain Nicholson of Haydon Bridge, a traditional fiddler.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{prospects}} of a non-farm, labour-intensive, <b>rural</b> <b>activity</b> (hat making) with strong linkages to an agriculturally backward economy. Hat making employs exclusively family labour, the main input (straw, paja de palma) is purchased from Ecuador, and consumers are concentrated in villages and small towns in rural areas. Following the presentation of a simple theoretical model {{of the market for}} hats, attention turns to an empirical analysis of the demand for hats and of the labour returns in hat supply. Primary data from four villages of the Peruvian North Sierra have been used. Demand and supply constraints to the expansion of the hat making activity are identified and important differences in the value of labour's marginal product across the sample are found. It is concluded that growth based on local demand will not be feasible given falling incomes of consumers-mainly farmers-and expected changes in consumer preferences. The growth motor for non-farm <b>rural</b> <b>activity</b> will have to rely more on market expansion and product diversification to urban consumers. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|E
