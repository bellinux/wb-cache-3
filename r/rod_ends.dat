2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} pneumatic valve springs a Formula One engine's high rpm output has been made possible due to advances in metallurgy and design allowing lighter pistons and connecting rods to withstand the accelerations necessary to attain such high speeds, also by narrowing the connecting <b>rod</b> <b>ends</b> allowing for narrower main bearings. This allows for higher rpm with less bearing-damaging heat build-up. For each stroke, the piston goes from a null speed, to almost two times the mean speed, (approximately 40m/s) then back to zero. This occurs once {{for each of the four}} strokes in the cycle: one Intake (down), one Compression (up), one Power (ignition-down), one Exhaust (up). [...] Maximum piston acceleration occurs at top dead center and is in the region of 95,000m/s2, about 10,000 times standard gravity or 10,000g.|$|E

When bright sparks passed between the <b>rod</b> <b>ends</b> 0.3 of an inch in diameter (1544.), very sudden dark parts would occur next to the brightest portions of the spark. Again with these ends and also with balls (1422.), the bright sparks would be sometimes red, sometimes green, and occasionally green and red {{in different parts of the}} same spark. Again, in the experiments described (1518.), at certain intervals a very peculiar pale, dull, yet sudden discharge would pass, which, though apparently weak, was very direct in its course, and accompanied by a sharp snapping noise, as if quick in its occurrence.|$|E

50|$|A {{mechanism}} {{in which a}} body moves through a general spatial movement is called a spatial mechanism. An example is the RSSR linkage, which {{can be viewed as}} a four-bar linkage in which the hinged joints of the coupler link are replaced by <b>rod</b> <b>ends,</b> also called spherical joints or ball joints. The <b>rod</b> <b>ends</b> allow the input and output cranks of the RSSR linkage to be misaligned to the point that they lie in different planes, which causes the coupler link to move in a general spatial movement. Robot arms, Stewart platforms, and humanoid robotic systems are also examples of spatial mechanisms.|$|E

40|$|The tie <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{elementary}} parts of a steering mechanism, which has direct and crucial importance in terms of driving safety. The main function of this part is to transfer the routing, coming from the steering linkage, to steering knuckle via tie rot arm. In this study the structural analysis of a tie <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> part for a van-type vehicle is carried out by finite element (FE) modeling of the body, the joint and the bearing. Hence, unlike the previous studies in literature, each component of the tie <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> is included in FE model and a complete assembly is analyzed by means of contact interactions between parts. The analyses for the joint assembly are carried out for different possible tie-end orientations, and by this modeling approach, the stress variations and deformation characteristics of each component are investigated for different operational loading conditions...|$|R
5000|$|While in {{automotive}} parlance {{the term}} [...] "ball joint" [...] usually {{refers to the}} primary ball joint connections {{at the ends of}} the control arms, this type of joint is used in other parts as well, including tie <b>rod</b> <b>ends.</b> In these other applications, they are typically called tie <b>rod</b> <b>ends</b> or, when they are an inner tie rod end on a rack-and-pinion steering system, they are called inner socket assemblies.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} demonstrated that an axially loaded weightless circular rod buckles helically when constrained within a circular cylinder. The effects of pinned and fixed end conditions {{on the behavior of}} such a helically buckled rod are investigated. Both end conditions locate the <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> on the cylinder axis. The pinned end condition considers the <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> free to rotate about all three axes, allows axial translation, and prevents radial movement. The fixed end condition allows axial rotation and translation, requires the <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> to be tangent to the cylinder axis, and prevents radial movement. Both end conditions are found to perturb the helix in an exponentially decaying manner for a distance of less than one pitch length. Far from the <b>end,</b> the <b>rod</b> behaves as an undisturbed constant-pitch helix. The distance from the <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> to the point of initial contact with the cylinder wall is calculated. Closed form analytical solutions are obtained for the deflected shapes and internal reactions of the end sections. The maximum internal bending moment for the pinned-end case is 19. 5 % higher in the end section than in the helical section. The maximum bending moment for the fixed-end case also occurs in the end section and is 1 % higher than in the helical section. The solution procedure applies to rods of either finite or infinite length. Experimental results confirm the analytical findings...|$|R

50|$|Many {{currently}} manufactured automobiles worldwide use MacPherson strut suspension, which utilises one {{ball joint}} per side, between {{the lower end}} of the strut and the control arm, with the necessary small amount of articulation at the top of the strut being usually provided by an elastomeric bearing, within which is a ball bearing to allow free rotation about the steering axis. So, there are commonly only two ball joints in the suspension, however there will be at least four (track <b>rod</b> <b>ends</b> and rack ends) in the steering linkage.|$|E

Following this discovery, the Allied governments gave the H.G. Heim Company an exclusive patent to manufacture these joints in North America, while in the UK the patent passed to Rose Bearings Ltd. The ubiquity of these manufacturers in their respective markets led to the terms heim joint and rose joint becoming synonymous with their product.

50|$|Similar gaiters {{to those}} {{described}} above find multiple uses on most vehicles.

Finally, they are also usually used to perform the same function on ball joints, which appear on suspension wishbones and steering tie <b>rod</b> <b>ends.</b> The gear stick gaiter is to resist dirt entering the ball joint {{at the bottom of the}} stick and to not have oil or grease from the joint exposed to passengers. They are commonly leather, faux leather, rubber or a waterproof cloth.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{single stage}} cold {{upsetting}} processes {{are limited to}} upset ratios 2 in micro range due to size effects. To still benefit from the advantages of upsetting, an alternative process chain called 2 ̆ 2 laser <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> melting 2 ̆ 2 is presented in this work. Prior to cold forming, the wrought material is locally melted by a laser beam whilst the surface tension causes the melt to form spherically, called 2 ̆ 2 preform 2 ̆ 2. Experimental investigations show that the master forming stage allows geometrical tolerance IT 9 in diameter of preform. An analytical, non-adiabatic model is set up describing very well the master forming stage in terms of pulse energy, deflection velocity and preform diameter. The dendritic grain structure of preforms does not show any deficits when forming is carried out in cone-shaped dies {{and it is possible}} to replicate surface structures as small as 0, 001 mm. Hence, this work shows that the laser <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> melting process is well suitable to significantly shorten multi-stage cold forming operations...|$|R
40|$|A {{report is}} {{presented}} {{of the observation}} of hysteretic bistable direction switching in a single-mode CW ruby laser system. This effect is only observed when the pump beam which is focused into the ruby rod is misaligned {{with respect to the}} <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> faces. At low pump powers, the ruby lases in a mode nearly collinear with the pump axis. At a higher pump power the ruby switches to a mode that is collinear with the <b>rod</b> <b>end</b> faces and preserves the original polarization. The effect is large enough to switch the beam by an angle equal to twice the diffraction angle. The observations show that under steady-state pumping, a CW ruby laser can exhibit bistable operation in its output direction and power. A calculation using the heat equation with two concentric cylinders with one as a heat source (pump laser) and the outer wall of the other held at 77 K, gives an increase in core temperature of about 0. 01 K. Therefore, the increase in temperature is not large enough to change the index of refraction to account for such large macroscopic effects...|$|R
