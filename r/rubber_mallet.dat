5000|$|<b>Rubber</b> <b>mallets</b> {{are used}} when a softer blow {{is called for}} than that {{delivered}} by a metal hammer. They are typically used to form sheet metal, since they do not leave marks and {{are less likely to}} dent the workpiece. <b>Rubber</b> <b>mallets</b> are also used for forcing tight-fitting parts together, for shifting plasterboard into place, in upholstery work, {{and a variety of other}} general purposes. It is a tool of preference for wood workers using chisels with plastic, metal, or wooden handles, as they give a softened strike with a positive drive. It is the most commonly used mallet.|$|R
50|$|The Great Stalacpipe Organ is an {{electrically}} actuated lithophone {{located in}} Luray Caverns, Virginia, USA. It is {{operated by a}} custom console that produces the tapping of ancient stalactites of varying sizes with solenoid-actuated <b>rubber</b> <b>mallets</b> {{in order to produce}} tones. The instrument's name was derived from the resemblance of the selected thirty-seven naturally formed stalactites to the pipework of a traditional pipe organ along with its custom organ-style keyboard console. It was designed and implemented in 1956 over three years by Leland W. Sprinkle inside the Luray Caverns near Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, USA.|$|R
5000|$|The {{modern western}} {{xylophone}} has bars of rosewood, padauk, or various synthetic {{materials such as}} fiberglass or fiberglass-reinforced plastic which allows a louder sound. Some can be as small a range as [...] octaves but concert xylophones are typically [...] or 4 octaves. The xylophone is a transposing instrument: its parts are written one octave below the sounding notes. Xylophones should be played with very hard rubber, polyball, or acrylic mallets. Sometimes medium to hard <b>rubber</b> <b>mallets,</b> very hard core, or yarn mallets are used for softer effects. Lighter tones can be created on xylophones by using wooden-headed mallets made from rosewood, ebony, birch, or other hard woods.|$|R

50|$|A high striker {{is usually}} {{composed}} of a heavy base, a long vertical tower, a bell, a puck, a lever, and a mallet. Initial versions of the base were of frame construction; later models were of unibody construction. The tower may be of wood, fiberglass, or aluminum material. The puck/dinger/chaser is suspended to a small groove that runs along the tower's length and can move freely up or down. The bell is identical {{to that of a}} traditional school bell in construction, mainly because it is to be struck from the side (bottom). Levers were traditionally constructed with a rubber padding above and below the end where the mallet is supposed to strike, in order to amplify the force and protect the lever. Long-handled 10-pound <b>rubber</b> <b>mallets</b> are used, but can vary depending on the high striker's size.|$|R

The Manobo sagabong ensemble follows a similar format, consisting of five small gongs, each held by one musician playing a unique pattern with <b>rubber</b> <b>mallets,</b> interlocking with other parts. The T’boli and Palawan have similar agung ensembles: the T’boli ensemble is composed of three to four agungs with two to three of them collectively called semagi which play variations, and the other agung, tang, providing a steady beat. The Palawan call their ensemble, composed of four gongs, a basal. It includes one to two large humped, low-sounding agungs and a pair of smaller humped, higher-pitched sanangs which produce metallic sounds.

5000|$|The bamboo {{instruments}} of the Joged, called Grantang or more commonly Tingklik, are marimba-like instruments {{made out of}} bamboo. 11 to 14 bamboo canes, split halfway down their length, are then carved so that a closed tube resonator remains on the un-split half. The completed keys are mounted to a wooden or bamboo frame with string or rubber strips. Striking the keys with <b>rubber</b> tipped <b>mallets</b> called pangguls results in a dry sound with little sustain. The instruments are played with both hands: the left hand plays the melody on the lower register, while the right hand plays a faster elaborated version of the melody. When the fast elaboration is too fast for one person to play alone, it is broken into two interlocking parts in a style called Kotekan.|$|R

50|$|Agungs {{also play}} a major role in agung orchestras—ensembles {{composed}} of large hanging, suspended or held, knobbed gongs which act as drones without any accompanying melodic instrument like a kulintang. Such orchestras are prevalent among Indigenous Philippine groups (Bagobo, Bilaan, Bukidon, Hanunoo, Magsaka, Manabo, Mangyan, Palawan, Subanun, Suludnon, T’boli, Tagakaolu, Tagbanwa and the Tiruray), regions in Kalimantan and Indonesia (Iban, Modang, Murut) and Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysia (Bidayuh, Iban, Kadazan-Dusun, Kajan, Kayan), places where agung orchestras take precedence over kulintang-like orchestras. The composition and tuning of these orchestras vary widely from one group to another. For instance, the Hanunoo of Mindoro have a small agung ensemble consisting of only two light gongs played by two musicians on the floor in a simple duple rhythm while the Manobo have an ensemble (called an ahong) consisting of 10 small agungs hung vertically on a triangular frame. It includes three musicians: one standing up, playing the melody, and the rest sitting. The ahong is divided by purpose, with the higher-pitched gongs (kaantuhan) carrying the melody, three to four lower-pitched gongs (gandingan) playing melodic ostinato figures, and the lowest-pitched gong (bandil) setting the tempo.The Tiruray call their agung ensemble a kelo-agung, kalatong, or karatung. It is made up of five shallow bossed gongs of graduating size, each played by one person. The smallest, the segaron, is used as the lead instrument, providing a steady beat.

50|$|These {{are similar}} to the timpani rolls in that they are done nearly the same way and are both single-stroked. Yarn mallets usually can be rolled much more easily on a marimba than plastic ones can be on a xylophone, because the extra {{reverberation}} of a marimba will mask the silent gaps between strokes. For this reason, the rolls can be much slower and still effective. But for xylophone and orchestra bells a much swifter roll is required, especially for <b>rubber</b> or plastic <b>mallets.</b> A brass mallet used with orchestra bells will add extra vibration to aid in the smoothing of the sound.|$|R

Later in their life, when KWR-37 units were aged and worn, sometimes the circuit cards inside had to be reseated with a <b>rubber</b> <b>mallet</b> which helped ensure the cards were reseated properly. Other problems with the KWR-37's were related to the startup times. Fleet radiomen, and those stationed in the shore transmitting stations, had to listen to an HF signal for coordinated universal time. Radiomen called this broadcast the [...] "time tick," [...] which gave them a sharp tone, signalling them to press the restart button so that the unit could then start up for [...] "new day" [...] or otherwise known as [...] "HJ's" [...] by the radiomen. This took place after the new day's crypto keylist card was properly inserted into the [...] "crib" [...] or the card reader by securing it onto pins and then firmly closing the card access door and then locking it with a key. Once the unit(s) were restarted, the key was placed back in the safe using two-person integrity (TPI) which was stringently enforced following the Walker spy investigation. In the early nineties when the KWR-37 units were retired from the navy and replaced by the more reliable and modern KWR-46's, fleet Radiomen {{breathed a sigh of relief}} because the KWR-37 units were often unreliable and would occasionally fall out of synchronization timing, resulting in a loss of broadcast messages from the various fleet channels.|$|E
50|$|During the 18th century, new {{techniques}} were perfected {{for the restoration}} and conservation of ancient works of art, including methods of detaching fresco paintings from walls.Detachment involves separating the layer of paint from its natural backing, generally stone or brick, and can be categorized according to the removal technique used.The oldest method, known as the a massello technique, involves cutting the wall and removing a considerable part of it together with both layers of plaster and the fresco painting itself.The stacco technique, on the other hand, involves removing only the preparatory layer of plaster, called the arriccio together with the painted surface.Finally, the strappo technique, without doubt the least invasive, involves removing only the topmost layer of plaster, known as the intonachino, which has absorbed the pigments, without touching the underlying arriccio layer.In this method, a protective covering made from strips of cotton and animal glue {{is applied to the}} painted surface. A second, much heavier cloth, larger than the painted area, is then laid on top and a deep incision is made in the wall {{around the edges of the}} fresco.A <b>rubber</b> <b>mallet</b> is used to repeatedly strike the fresco so that it detaches from the wall. Using a removal tool, a sort of awl, the painting and the intonachino attached to the cloth and glue covering are then detached, from the bottom up.The back of the fresco is thinned to remove excess lime and reconstructed with a permanent backing made from two thin cotton cloths, called velatini, and a heavier cloth with a layer of glue. Two layers of mortar are then applied; first a rough one and then a smoother, more compact layer.The mortars make up the first real layer of the new backing. The velatini cloths and the heavier cloth serve only to facilitate future detachments, and are therefore known as the strato di sacrificio, or sacrificial layer.Once the mortar is dry, a layer of adhesive is applied and the fresco is attached to a rigid support made from synthetic material which can be used to reconstruct the architecture that originally housed the fresco.After the backing has completely dried, the cloth covering used to protect the front of the fresco during detachment is removed using a hot water spray and decoloured ethyl alcohol.|$|E

In this experiment, 218.8  g {{of the dry}} manure (0.10  g/g water content, wet basis) were placed in 1 -L glass containers. There were three treatments, including the control, with three replications for each treatment. For the control (i.e., no water application), three containers with the dry manure were randomly selected. For the moist/loose manure treatment, three other containers were randomly selected and 111.2  g water at room temperature (22  °C) was added into the containers and slowly mixed with the dry manure. That amount of water represented a column of 16.7  mm of a simulated short-term but intense rainfall. Intense rainfall events between 8 and 22  mm were common in the field during the 2010 spring and summer seasons [20]. Final wet bulk density in the containers (Table  1) was within the range measured under field conditions, as described by Aguilar et al. [20]. For the moist/compacted manure treatment, samples were prepared {{in the same fashion}} as the moist/loose manure treatment, then immediately after mixing the water and the dry manure, samples were uniformly compacted until a wet bulk density of 1.1  g cm− 3 was reached to simulate field conditions. Compaction was performed manually using a cylindrical wooden stick and a <b>rubber</b> <b>mallet.</b> To standardize the compaction process, samples were compacted until a final volume of 300  cc of moist manure within the containers was reached.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. October 2008. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisors: Carol K. Shield, Catherine E. French. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxv, 187 pages, appendices A-H. Self-consolidating concrete (SCC), which {{is different from}} conventional concrete especially in its fresh state, is a highly workable concrete that flows through congested reinforcement under its own weight alone, filling the formwork without segregation of its constituent materials with a void-free structure, and can be placed without any vibration. Self-consolidating concrete was first developed in Japan in the early 1980 s, and the main issues that promoted the development of SCC were the shortage of skilled labor {{and the emergence of}} heavily reinforced structures that made it difficult to sufficiently consolidate the concrete which is crucial for its durability. Although some raw materials and chemical admixtures may increase the initial cost, its use is on the rise worldwide for precast concrete construction mainly due to its ease of placement over conventional concrete. Some benefits of using SCC for precast concrete applications are easily quantified such as faster construction, reduced noise level, and improved surface finish which eliminates the need for patching. Other less tangible benefits include worker safety improvements and extended life of the precasting forms. Although SCC has been developed and successfully used for numerous precast and cast-in-place applications worldwide, and both fresh and hardened properties of SCC have been investigated, concerns have remained regarding mix proportioning, acceptance criteria of SCC in its plastic state, and long term behavior (e. g., creep and shrinkage) of SCC precast/pretensioned elements in service. Limited literature is available to evaluate the hardened and long-term behavior of SCC members, particularly creep, shrinkage, and elastic modulus. Furthermore, there is a wide variation in the findings regarding the long-term behavior of SCC. Due to these reasons, many state departments of transportation, including the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT), have been hesitant to allow SCC for precast bridge girder applications. This study was initiated with the intent to investigate the viability of using SCC developed at local precast plants with locally available materials for the construction of precast prestressed SCC girders in the State of Minnesota. The primary objective of the research was to determine both short-term and long-term properties of SCC bridge girders, evaluate the applicability and accuracy of available test procedures, design equations, and material models for SCC bridge girders. The research was divided into several phases. In the first phase, SCC trial mixes were developed using locally available materials from two local precast concrete plants (Plant-A and Plan-B). The developed trial SCC mixes were studied to identify the main parameters that affect the performance of SCC in its fresh state (e. g., flowability and segregation resistance) such as cement, high-range water reducing admixture dosage, and fresh concrete temperature. It was found that variations in cement from the same supplier with no difference in the cement mill report can significantly affect the flowability of SCC, and recommendations were included for the effect of concrete temperature and admixture dosage on fresh concrete properties. In addition, a testing program was undertaken to evaluate the static and dynamic one-dimensional free flow and flow through reinforcing obstacle segregation resistances of SCC and passing ability of coarse aggregate through reinforcing obstacles. Correlations between different test results were investigated to minimize the required number of test methods to adequately evaluate SCC mixtures. The next phase involved casting four SCC and two conventional concrete precast prestressed bridge girders using locally available materials from Plant-A and Plant-B (three girders per plant). The girders were Mn/DOT 36 M I-girders with a span length of 38 ft, and design concrete compressive strengths of 7. 5 ksi at release and 9. 0 ksi at 28 days. The girders were designed incorporating 36 straight strands in the bottom flange, and four strands in the top flange to avoid the need to drape strands (total of 40 strands). This large amount of prestressed strand was used to create a situation with congested reinforcement to challenge the SCC flow. In addition, the large amount of prestress maximized the allowable compressive stresses at release in the bottom concrete fiber to maximize the concrete creep. The section represented one of the most severe cases for the application of SCC. In addition to the girders, companion cylinders were cast to monitor compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, creep, and shrinkage over time. The girders were instrumented and stored in an outdoor storage site for a period of approximately 2 years to monitor both short-term and long-term performance, which included transfer length, camber, and prestress losses. Both short-term (e. g., elastic shortening) and long-term performance of the girders (e. g., prestress losses) were measured and compared to AASHTO (2004 and 2007), PCI Design Handbook 6 th Edition (2004), and PCI General Method (PCI, 1975) predictions. The results indicated that the predicted total long-term prestress losses calculated with AASHTO 2004, PCI Design Handbook 6 th Edition (2004), and PCI General Method (PCI, 1975) using measured material properties obtained from conventional cylinders were conservative for both SCC and conventional concrete girders (Note that the SCC conventional cylinders were fabricated with a slightly modified process; rather than rodding the cylinders after each lift, the sides of the mold were tapped with a <b>rubber</b> <b>mallet).</b> The predicted long-term losses {{at the end of the}} monitoring periods (i. e., approximately 600 days and 450 days for Plant-A and Plant-B, respectively) were larger than measured losses by 2 to 5 % for AASHTO 2004 Lump Sum Method, 12 to 15 % for AASHTO 2004 Refined Method, 4 to 7 % for PCI General Method, and 8 to 11 % for PCI Design Handbook Method for all girders. However, the long-term prestress losses computed with AASHTO- 2007 (Approximate Estimate of Time-Dependent Losses) were either not conservative or very close to the measured losses for both the SCC and conventional concrete girders at the end of the monitoring periods. The magnitude of the difference between the measured and predicted losses was comparable for both the conventional and SCC girders. Finally the girders were tested in three-point bending to determine the cracking and crack re-opening loads at the University of Minnesota Structures Laboratory. The experimentally measured crack re-opening loads were used to indirectly calculate the remaining effective prestressing forces and total prestress losses. Also, a semi-destructive test method was used to experimentally measure the remaining tendon forces to verify the field measured losses. The measured girder prestress losses were compared to those determined from a fiber-based finite element analysis incorporating time-dependent creep and shrinkage models based on companion cylinder data. The measured, predicted, and calculated prestress losses were generally in good agreement. The study indicated that creep and shrinkage material models developed based on measured companion cylinder creep and shrinkage data can be used to reasonably predict measured field prestress losses of both conventional and SCC prestressed bridge girders...|$|E
