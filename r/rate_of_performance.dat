Bibliography: leaves [76]- 80. vii, 80 l tablesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{reinforcing}} effects of contingent self-reward with college students on an intellectual, though boring task. Forty-five male and female college students were instructed to work on a pile of simple addition problems for as long as they wished. Subjects in the self-reward condition presented themselves with sections of a television film contingent upon a fixed-ratio schedule that they had selected from three alternatives. An experimenter-rewarded group, yoked to the self-reward subjects in terms of the schedule upon which they were reinforced, received the movie sections automatically. A control group received rest-periods instead of sections of the film. The results supported the hypothesis that contingent self-reward can have reinforcing effects. The self-reward group completed significantly more problems than the control group; however, there were no significant differences in number of problems completed between the self-reward and the experimenter-rewarded groups. Two other measures, <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> and increase in <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> over time, reflected no significant reinforcement effects for the two rewarded groups over the control group. Individual differences in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> and the relative stability of these measures are believed to account for the lack of effects.

40|$|Syrah is an {{important}} wine grape in California but is potentially difficult to manage in the vineyard due to its excessive vigor. Vigorous grapevines require more labor for canopy management and tend to create excess shade, decreasing fruit quality. Winter pruning level, shoot thinning and leaf removal influence the overall density of the canopy and the subsequent degree of shade in the fruit zone. An experiment was conducted to assess the effects of two pruning levels with three degrees of labor-intensive canopy management techniques on berry maturation rate and harvest berry parameters for two growing seasons. In 2008, repeated measures analysis showed no significant effects of severe pruning, shoot thinning or both sides leaf removal on maturation <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> indicators. At harvest 2008, severe pruning caused a decrease in yield/meter trellis and Ravaz index. In 2009, repeated measures analysis showed significant effects of severe pruning increasing brix, pH and sugar to acid ratio while shoot thinning and both sides leaf removal had no significant effects on maturation <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> indicators. At harvest 2009, severe pruning increased brix, pH, tannin, anthocyanins, phenolics, color density, potassium, amino acid % of yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN), and the following ratios: sugar/acid, amino acid/ammonium, tannin/anthocyanins and malic/tartaric acid. Additionally, severe pruning decreased tartaric acid, yield/meter trellis, ammonium % of YAN and Ravaz index. The findings presented in this thesis suggest that severe pruning {{could be used as}} a tool in viticultural areas with short growing seasons because of the increased ripening speed observed. However, because severe pruning generally increases berry size which is negative for vinification, it should be studied further with irrigation and management practices that decrease berry size...|$|E
