5|$|Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the 23-yard line, and Clemson went three and out after Simmons threw three incomplete passes. The Tigers' punt {{was returned}} to the Tech 30-yard line, and the Hokies began another possession. Vick was again replaced by Meyer at the quarterback position, and running back Dwayne Ward ran up {{the middle of the}} field for a short gain. Third-string running back Keith Burnell gained more yardage with a <b>run</b> <b>up</b> the middle, then Ward picked up a first down with a <b>run</b> <b>up</b> the left side of the field. During the play, Tech committed a 10-yard penalty, but the resulting yardage was still enough for a first down. Tech proceeded to run out the remaining seconds on the clock, and the Virginia Tech Hokies earned a 4120 victory.|$|E

40|$|As is well known, {{the grammar}} of English distinguishes between {{particles}} and prepositions (both of which I will abbreviate P; see Emonds 1985). A P–DP string after a verb, {{like those in}} (1), is in principle ambiguous. Particle shift, seen in (2), constituency tests, illustrated in (3), and Heavy NP Shift, as in (4), distinguish particles from prepositions. (1) a. The professor <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> a hill. b. The professor <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> a bill. (2) a. *The professor <b>ran</b> a hill <b>up.</b> b. The professor <b>ran</b> a bill <b>up.</b> (3) a. Up which hill did he run first? b. *Up which bill did he run first? (4) a. *The professor <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> yesterday the biggest hill in Skåne. b. The professor <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> yesterday the biggest bill in Skåne. In some cases one test or another fails; for example the prepositional phrase in (5 a) does not pass constituency tests, as indicated in (5 b-d) ...|$|R
5|$|With {{limited time}} remaining, Clemson {{attempted}} an onside kick {{in an effort}} to retain possession and have a chance to make up some of the scoring deficit. The kick was recovered by Virginia Tech, however, and the Vick-led Tech offense returned to the field at the Clemson 44-yard line. Suggs was stopped for no gain on a <b>run</b> <b>up</b> the middle, Vick threw an incomplete pass, then he completed a 14-yard pass to Wynn for a first down at the Clemson 30-yard line. After the first down, Ferguson gained a few yards on a <b>run</b> <b>up</b> the middle, then Suggs advanced the ball to just short of the first-down marker. On third down, Suggs gained the first down with a <b>run</b> <b>up</b> the middle. Following the first down, Clemson defender Alex Ardley was called for a personal foul and ejected from the game. The penalty gave Virginia Tech a first down at the Clemson 10-yard line. From there, Clemson was called for a five-yard offsides penalty. On the first play after the consecutive penalties, Vick pitched the ball to Suggs, who ran into the end zone untouched. The extra point kick was good, and Virginia Tech extended its lead to 4120 with 3:41 remaining in the game.|$|E

5|$|In the <b>run</b> <b>up</b> to UEFA Euro 2008, Baroš had not scored an {{international}} goal since March 2007. He started the Czech Republic's second group game against Portugal, but Portugal won 3–1 and Baroš failed to score. Jan Koller was preferred to Baroš {{in the starting}} lineup for the next match, against Turkey. Despite neither playing in the match nor even being on the pitch, Baroš suffered the indignity of receiving a yellow card during stoppage time {{at the end of the}} match.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Corporation {{stated that}} it wished to <b>run</b> <b>up</b> to four multichannels at {{different}} times of the day or alternatively offer an HDTV service. It claimed that up to $100 million would be needed to prepare for these services, half of which would need to be government-funded. Other interested parties, such as internet service provider OzEmail argued for the provision of spectrum for interactive services, while Telstra, shareholder in the subscription television provider Foxtel, supported ASTRA's argument for a competitive bidding process for digital spectrum.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century. Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic {{rules of the}} modern event were standardised there. Athletes have a short <b>run</b> <b>up</b> and then take off {{from one foot to}} jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a cushioned landing area. The men's high jump was included in the 1896 Olympics and a women's competition followed in 1928.|$|E

5|$|A defenseman is {{a player}} {{position}} whose {{responsibility is to}} assist the goalkeeper in preventing the opposing team from scoring. Each team fields three defensemen. These players generally remain on the defensive half of the field. Unless a defenseman gets the ball and chooses to <b>run</b> <b>up</b> the field and try to score or pass, by doing this {{they will need to}} cross the midfield line and signal one midfielder to stay back. A defensemen carries a long crosse which provides an advantage in reach for intercepting passes and checking.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} {{was used by}} the LIMPET 500 (Land Installed Marine Power Energy Transformer) energy converter which was installed on the island of Islay by Wavegen Ltd. It was a shore-based unit and generated power when waves <b>run</b> <b>up</b> the beach, creating pressure inside an inclined oscillating water column. This in turn creates pneumatic power which drives the twin 250kW generators. Islay LIMPET was opened in 2001 and was the world's first commercial scale wave-energy device. In March 2013 Voith Hydro decided to close down Wavegen choosing to concentrate on tidal power projects.|$|E
5|$|As an {{implement}} {{of war and}} hunting, javelin throwing began in prehistoric times. Along with the discus, the javelin was the second throwing event in the ancient Olympic pentathlon. Records from 708 BC show two javelin competition types co-existing: throwing at a target and throwing the javelin for distance. It was the latter type from which the modern event derives. In ancient competitions, athletes would wrap an ankyle (thin leather strip) around the javelin that acted as a sling to facilitate extra distance. The javelin throw gained much popularity in Scandinavia in the late 19th century and athletes from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men's competitions. The modern event features a short <b>run</b> <b>up</b> on a track and then the thrower releases the javelin before the foul line.|$|E
