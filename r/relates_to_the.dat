5|$|Unlike hardness, which denotes only {{resistance}} to scratching, diamond's toughness or tenacity is only fair to good. Toughness <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ability to resist breakage from falls or impacts. Because of diamond's perfect and easy cleavage, it {{is vulnerable to}} breakage. A diamond will shatter if hit with an ordinary hammer. The toughness of natural diamond has been measured as 2.0 MPa m1/2, which is good compared to other gemstones, but poor compared to most engineering materials. As with any material, the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its {{resistance to}} breakage. Diamond has a cleavage plane and is therefore more fragile in some orientations than others. Diamond cutters use this attribute to cleave some stones, prior to faceting.|$|E

Though usually depicted two-armed, four-armed representations of the deity also exist.|$|E
