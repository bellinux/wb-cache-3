40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{isolates}} (173) from 144 {{patients with}} cystic fibrosis (CF) of the pancreas in seven hospitals were serotyped with the agglutination systems of Homma (1974) and Fisher et al. (1969). The two systems were complementary. Strains from CF patients {{were much less}} likely to furnish a stable type on <b>repetitive</b> <b>typing</b> tests than strains from other patients. This was related to the frequent occurrence of mucoid P. aeruginosa strains. The 173 strains were divided among 11 Homma serotypes. A single Homma type (type 8) capable of mucoid growth comprised 104 (60 %) CF strains. Eight serotypes were detected in 77 strains from 48 CF patients in one hospital; three strains were detected in one hospital CF unit; and two strains were detected in each of five hospital CF units. The CF serotype comprised from 50 to 93 % of CF strians inthe seven hospitals. These P. aeruginosa strains dissociated in vivo as judged by mucoid and nonmucoid colonies on primary culture plates and continued to dissociate during subcultures. Both colony type were the same serotype. The tendency to regard colonial phenotypes (mucoid, nonmucoid, rough) as separate strians was erroneous. <b>Repetitive</b> <b>typing</b> with the two systems gave better results than a single system. The mucoid P. aeruginosa strain is probably spread from patient to patient, rather than acquiring its mucoid characteristic de novo in the CF patient. It is not known why the mucoid CF strain has a peculiar predilection for CF patients, nor why it generally loses the quality in culture but retains it indefinitely in the patient...|$|E

We consider the local type inference problem, where fields and parameter/return types are given, but local variable types are inferred. We have designed and implemented Mocha, a Java language extension providing type inference, and we formalise a subset of it here. Mocha differs from other languages using type inference, such as Scala, C # 3. 0 and OCaml, since variables can have different types at different program points. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} biomechanical impact of commercially {{available}} alternate keyboard designs. Design. A repeated measures {{study was conducted}} in a laboratory setting, with planned comparisons of Pitch, Roll and Yaw angles of the keyboards. Ten keyboard conditions were tested. Dependent measures included tendon travel, wrist deviations, and wrist and finger kinematics. Background. Various alternate keyboard designs have recently been introduced, which vary Pitch, Roll and Yaw angles, sepa-ration distance between keyboard halves, and include other novel features such as cup-shaped depressions for the keys. Yet little objective research has been conducted regarding the biomechanical implications of these various design features. This study at-tempts to quantify the keyboard designs in terms of several recognized risk factors associated with cumulative trauma disorders that arise with <b>repetitive</b> <b>typing.</b> Methods. Wrist and finger goniometers were used to measure joint motions during a standardized typing task. 15 experienced typists (8 women, 7 men) served as subjects. Regression equations were used to generate estimates of tendon travel. Results. Tendon travel was aected primarily by Pitch but not Roll or Yaw angles while wrist deviations responded to changes in all three angles. Males had significantly greater amount of tendon travel than female subjects; this dierence was only partially accounted for by anthropometry. Dierences in joint motion may have a greater impact on the amount of tendon travel. Conclusions. Alternate keyboard designs can aect tendon travel by as much as 11 %.

Seven rDNA-RFLP <b>repetitive</b> <b>types</b> (repetypes) were recognized among 15 shrews examined.

The RFLP repetype from Cheju Island was close to that of S. caecutiens from the Eurasian continent, indicating that the shrew of Cheju should be classified as S. caecutiens. Within S. caecutiens, there were two alternative phylogenetic hypotheses. According to a parsimonious tree and a simple network, the Hokkaido population was regarded to be derived from the Sakhalin population, which in turn was derived from the continental population. Alternatively, it was inferred that the continent and Hokkaido populations were firstly separated from the ancestral population, and then shrews from both populations immigrated into Sakhalin and hybridization occurred there.

Evidence adduced to support Harlow's hypothesis that learning-set (LS) learning is dependent upon some capacity factor or factors transcending those needed for intraproblem learning of equivalent problems (Harlow, 1959, p. 504) comes from four sources, (a) Phylogenetically more advanced species evidence greater LS learning than less advanced species (e. g., Harlow, 1959).

The non-thermal hard X-ray emission in 25 - 50 keV observed by RHESSI shows five distinct impulsive peaks of decaying amplitude with {{a period of about}} three minutes. Similar QPP was observed in the microwave emission recorded by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph and Polarimeter in the 8. 8, 15, 17 GHz channels. Interestingly, the 3 -min QPP was also observed in the metric and decimetric radio frequencies (25 – 180, 245, 610 MHz) as <b>repetitive</b> <b>type</b> III bursts. Multi-wavelength observations from the SDO/AIA, Hinode/SOT, and STEREO/SECCHI suggest a fan-spine topology at the eruption site, associated with the formation of a quasi-circular ribbon during the flare. A small filament was observed below the fan-loops before the flare onset. The filament rose slowly and interacted with the ambient field. This behaviour was followed by an untwisting motion of the filament. Two different structures of the filament showed ∼ 3 -min periodic alternate rotation in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions. The 3 -min QPP was found to highly correlate with 3 -min oscillations in a nearby sunspot. We suggest that the periodic reconnection (modulated either by sunspot slow-mode wave or by untwisting filament) at a magnetic null-point most likely causes the repetitive particle acceleration, generating the QPP observed in hard X-ray, microwave and type III radio bursts...|$|R

40|$|For too long, {{architecture}} {{has stood}} {{as an expression}} of permanence, recording a specific moment in history. This project begins with an idea that the adaptation of architecture is eminent, thus changing the process in which we design. The information age resulted in a highly mobile society, where modernization became more generic, the specificity of place changed, and time became more abstract. Mechanic invention supplied ‘generic’ standards to improve common application for tools. Strategies of a general building system could be familiarized with a local place, inherent with the idea of versatility. Through this design, {{it is important not to}} reiterate the vernacular, but to express the proactive role. Adaptability in the terms of the architecture as we understand it is, is more than the satisfaction of need (shelter, etc.), more than the mere definition of space. Architecture is superlative: the thing that it brings to the table that elevates it above mere building is the expression of an idea or concept. Le Corbusier’s “House-machine,” wasn’t about literally being a tool for dwelling, about needs, or performing tasks; it was a new way of living, about aesthetic beauty in the machine and translating that into architecture. The two images (left), symbolize direction towards a new goal needing to be achieved. It was a goal of change in terms of mobility, family type, and interaction in regards to technology. The Micro-Compact House stood as adaptability to various ecological conditions, being off-the-grid in terms of power, and keeping in mind conditions of its inhabitants through specific needs. Where the Cape Cod style house eluded to being rooted in its environment. The Cape Cod house, in my opinion was built to address the array of needs of individuals that would inhabit it, as opposed to the specificity through conformed owernship. As time picks up and becomes more progressive, the house itself will remain the same. In other words, it has no capacity at adaptability or versatility. Fall semester began with a question, “If architecture was adaptable, to what extent/extents should it be?” From the start, I produced the image of a multi-tool pocket knife, (page 9) {{as an expression of}} and symbol for adaptability and versatility. The components are most commonly seen as an array showing expressive potential, but naturally are seen in closed state with hidden potential. The images in the middle then shows each tool in action as it would be used. Zuk and Clark, constantly referred to this type of behavior as “Place-creation, or an extension of changing cultural needs. ” These multi-tools could be seen as a universal form with a <b>repetitive</b> <b>type</b> gesture in terms of the internal features. These <b>repetitive</b> <b>type</b> tools as stated by Neil Denari is the process of adding to conditions of a specific form.

Two selected groups were employed; an incarcerated 'criminal recidivists' group and a control group of 'non- criminals' from a vocational rehabilitation centre. The groups were matched for social-class and level of education. Controls as a group, however, were significantly older and scored higher on intelligence (p<. 0 l). Product moment correlations and analysis of co-variance indicated that the performance of both groups on these tests was independent of age and intelligence (measured by the AH 4 part II). The results showed that controls scored significantly higher (more abstract responses) than criminals, on both tests. The criminals displayed a typical pattern of more concrete and <b>repetitive</b> <b>types</b> of symbolizations and fewer abstract responses. This has led to the formulation of typical K. T. S. A. and S. T. C. criminal ‘Symbol-Pattern’ which identified correctly 72 % and 77 % of all participants, respectively (chi-square, p <. 001). A combined K. T. S. A + S. T. C. score elicited the best classification (80 % correct identifications, chi-square, p <. 001).). The results were interpreted in terms of the hypothesis that criminality is associated with an "arrested cognitive (and emotional) development on the decriminalization process", i. e. the process of socialisation. Future refinements of the S. T. C. were also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Now a day’s mass housing {{construction}} projects {{are common in}} India. There are so many approaches {{have been used for}} repetitive construction projects towards optimizing time and cost. In this project we have implemented a proposed theoretical model for effective utilization of labour to get optimum duration and cost. Generally critical path method is used for <b>repetitive</b> <b>type</b> of construction but in this project we use programme evaluation review technique to find the duration of project. There are many resources which affect the project time and cost like material, money, machinery, space etc. But from the literature survey it is observed that now a day’s the labour is major resource which affects the productivity of project. Labour absenteeism rate is about 5 % to 25 % in construction projects, which is vary according to the size of projects. There are so many factors affecting the labour absenteeism. The study of these factors is necessary because by studying these factors we get an idea about the labours problems. Once we know about the labour problems we can solve their problems, we can provide a various facilities by which labours get satisfied. So in this way we can reduce the absenteeism rate of labours by solving their problems and by providing good facilities to them. The goal of any construction project is to complete the project within the estimated time and with minimum cost. The delay in a construction projects affects both owner and contractor. The main goal {{of this study is to}} find out the optimum duration for the completion of project. Because we know that if the project duration is minimum then project cost i...|$|R
