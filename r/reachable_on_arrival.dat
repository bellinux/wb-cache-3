40|$|Aim To {{investigate}} {{the association of}} temperature <b>on</b> <b>arrival</b> to hospital after out-of-hospital-cardiac arrest (OHCA) with the primary outcome of mortality, in the targeted temperature management (TTM) trial. Methods The TTM trial randomized 939 patients to TTM at 33 or 36 °C for 24 h. Patients were categorized according to their recorded body temperature <b>on</b> <b>arrival</b> and also categorized to groups of patients being actively cooled or passively rewarmed. Results OHCA patients having a temperature ≤ 34. 0 °C <b>on</b> <b>arrival</b> at hospital had a significantly higher mortality compared to the OHCA patients with a higher temperature <b>on</b> <b>arrival.</b> A low body temperature <b>on</b> <b>arrival</b> {{was associated with a}} longer time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and duration of transport time to hospital. Patients who were actively cooled or passively rewarmed during the first 4 h had similar mortality. In a multivariate logistic regression model mortality was significantly related to time from OHCA to ROSC, time from OHCA to advanced life support (ALS), age, sex and first registered rhythm. None of the temperature related variables (included the TTM-groups) were significantly related to mortality. Conclusion OHCA patients with a temperature ≤ 34. 0 °C <b>on</b> <b>arrival</b> have a higher mortality than patients with a temperature ≥ 34. 1 °C <b>on</b> <b>arrival.</b> A low temperature <b>on</b> <b>arrival</b> is associated with a long time to ROSC.
