The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E

5|$|Despite the improvements, the {{in-service}} <b>rates</b> <b>for</b> the F-84E remained poor {{with less}} than half of the aircraft operational at any given time.

The actual flight hours for Korean War and NATO deployments rapidly outpaced the supply and Allison's ability to manufacture new engines. The F-84E was withdrawn from USAF service in 1956, lingering with ANG units until 1959.|$|E
