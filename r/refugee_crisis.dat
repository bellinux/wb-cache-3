5|$|In 1939, Winton {{cancelled}} {{a trip to}} a Swiss {{holiday resort}} to go to Prague, having heard of a growing <b>refugee</b> <b>crisis</b> resulting from the German occupation of Czechoslovakia from a friend. His friend was working in the British embassy for the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia, which was already working to help adults escape from Czechoslovakia. When Winton learned that refugee children could not leave unless accompanied, he decided to arrange their evacuation to Britain. While the Winton evacuations later became known by the collective label of the children's Kindertransports, which were officially being organised elsewhere in other countries, no official Kindertransports had been arranged in Prague at that time.|$|E

5|$|Led by Fridtjof Nansen, the Commission for Refugees was {{established}} on 27 June 1921 {{to look after}} the interests of refugees, including overseeing their repatriation and, when necessary, resettlement. At the end of the First World War, there were two to three million ex-prisoners of war from various nations dispersed throughout Russia; within two years of the commission's foundation, it had helped 425,000 of them return home. It established camps in Turkey in 1922 to aid the country with an ongoing <b>refugee</b> <b>crisis,</b> helping to prevent disease and hunger. It also established the Nansen passport as a means of identification for stateless people.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{landslides}} {{and floods}} {{are projected to}} become increasingly common in such states as Assam. Ecological disasters, such as a 1998 coral bleaching event that killed off more than 70% of corals in the reef ecosystems off Lakshadweep and the Andamans and was brought on by elevated ocean temperatures tied to global warming, are also projected to become increasingly common. Meghalaya and other northeastern states are also concerned that rising sea levels will submerge much of Bangladesh and spawn a <b>refugee</b> <b>crisis.</b> If severe climate changes occurs, Bangladesh and parts of India that border it may lose vast tracts of coastal land.|$|E
5|$|While some 700,000–1,000,000 Iraqis came to Jordan {{following}} the Iraq War in 2003, most have returned. Many Iraqi Christians (Assyrians/Chaldeans) however settled temporarily or permanently in Jordan. Immigrants also include 15,000 Lebanese who arrived {{following the}} 2006 Lebanon War. Since 2010, over 1.4 million Syrian refugees have fled to Jordan {{to escape the}} violence in Syria. The kingdom has continued to demonstrate hospitality, despite the substantial strain the flux of Syrian refugees places on the country. The effects are largely affecting Jordanian communities, as {{the vast majority of}} Syrian refugees do not live in camps. The <b>refugee</b> <b>crisis</b> effects include competition for job opportunities, water resources and other state provided services, along with the strain on the national infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|In {{the past}} few decades, {{the legacy of the}} League of Nations started to be {{reviewed}} by historians as the League Archives at Geneva were better explored, and the United Nations faced similar troubles to those of the interwar period. The current consensus state that, even though the League failed to achieve its ultimate goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the rule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of collective security, giving a voice to smaller nations; helped to raise awareness to problems like epidemics, slavery, child labor, colonial tyranny, <b>refugee</b> <b>crisis</b> and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the mandate system put the colonial powers under international observation.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the origins}} of the recent {{conflict}} in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo stems from the turmoil following the Rwandan Genocide of 1994, which then led to the Great Lakes <b>refugee</b> <b>crisis.</b> Within the largest refugee camps, beginning in Goma in Nord-Kivu, were Rwandan Hutu fighters, who were eventually organised into the Rassemblement Démocratique pour le Rwanda, who launched repeated attacks into Rwanda. Rwanda eventually backed Laurent-Désiré Kabila and his quickly organised Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo in invading Zaire, aiming to stop the attacks on Rwanda in the process of toppling Mobutu's government. When the militias rebelled, backed by Rwanda, the FAZ, weakened as is noted above, proved incapable of mastering the situation and preventing the overthrow of Mobutu in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the U.S. bombing on the Khmer Rouge and the death toll of Cambodian civilians is disputed. With limited data, the range of Cambodian deaths caused by U.S. bombing may be between 40,000 and 150,000 Cambodian civilians and Khmer Rouge fighters. Another impact of the U.S. bombing and the Cambodian civil war was to destroy the homes and livelihood of many people. This was a heavy contributor to the <b>refugee</b> <b>crisis</b> in Cambodia with two million people—more than 25 percent of the population—displaced from rural areas into the cities, especially Phnom Penh which grew from about 600,000 in 1970 to an estimated population of nearly 2 million by 1975. The Cambodian government estimated that more than 20 percent of the property in the country had been destroyed during the war.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after its}} secession, South Kasaian and Congolese troops clashed after the Congolese central {{government}} ordered an offensive against it. The offensive, {{planned to be}} the first act of an offensive against Katanga, was accompanied by widespread massacres of Baluba and a <b>refugee</b> <b>crisis</b> termed a genocide by some contemporaries. The state was rapidly overrun by Congolese troops. The violence in the suppression of Kasai provided much legitimacy to Joseph Kasa-Vubu's deposition of Patrice Lumumba from the office of Prime Minister in late 1960 and Lumumba's later arrest and assassination. As a result, South Kasai remained on relatively good terms with the new Congolese government from 1961. Its leaders, including Kalonji himself, served in both the South Kasaian government and the Congolese parliament. South Kasai continued to exercise quasi-independence while Congolese and United Nations troops were able to move through the territory without conflict with the South Kasaian gendarmerie. In April 1961, Kalonji took the royal title Mulopwe ("King of the Baluba") to tie the state more closely to the pre-colonial Luba Empire. The act divided the South Kasaian authorities and Kalonji was disavowed by the majority of South Kasai's parliamentary representatives in Léopoldville. In December 1961, Kalonji was arrested on a legal pretext in Léopoldville and imprisoned. UN and Congolese troops occupied South Kasai. In September 1962, shortly after his escape from prison and return to South Kasai, Kalonji was ousted by a military coup d'état which forced him into exile and brought the secession to an end.|$|E

25|$|An {{independence}} movement {{broke out in}} East Pakistan which was crushed by Pakistani forces. Due to large-scale atrocities against them, thousands of Bengalis took refuge in neighbouring India causing a major <b>refugee</b> <b>crisis</b> there.
