It is governed by International Law as {{described}} in Unorthodox Crossing of the Dover Strait Traffic Separation Scheme. It states: [...] "In exceptional cases the French Maritime Authorities may grant authority for unorthodox craft to cross French territorial waters within the Traffic Separation Scheme when these craft set off from the British coast, on condition that the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>authorisation</b> is sent to them with the opinion of the British Maritime Authorities." ...|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, conte Augusto Verità had {{returned}} to Verona. Always enjoying {{good relations with the}} French, he proposed to get an assurance of French neutrality before the Veronese forces clashed with the Jacobins. Writing to the commander of the French troops at Verona, general Antoine Balland, he stated:The substance of the letter was a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>authorisation</b> to defend Verona's boundaries against aggressors, which the French general was forced to consent to, since if he did not the only way they could officialice their arrival would be through Venice's authority over her territories. Bonaparte agreed with Balland's decision, and informed the Venetian senate that French troops would not intervene and that he was hurt by how much success they had had at Bergamo and Brescia. Balland's response to the letter aroused Verona's inhabitants to great enthusiasm for defending their own territory.|$|E
5000|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{commenced}} a re-evaluation of aspartame {{as part of}} {{the systematic}} re-evaluation of all food additives authorised in the EU prior to 20 January 2009. In May 2011, EFSA was asked by the European Commission to bring forward the full re-evaluation of the safety of aspartame (E 951), which was previously planned for completion by 2020. In September 2011, the EFSA made all 600 datasets it is using in its full re-evaluation available publicly. This includes previously unpublished scientific data, [...] "including the 112 original studies on aspartame which were submitted to support the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>authorisation</b> of aspartame in Europe in the early 1980s." [...] On January 8, 2013, the EFSA released its draft report, which found that aspartame and its metabolites [...] "pose no toxicity concern for consumers at current levels of exposure. The current Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is considered to be safe for the general population and consumer exposure to aspartame is below this ADI." ...|$|E

BACKGROUND Within the framework of Regulation 258 / 97 /EC on novel foods and novel food ingredients, a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>authorisation</b> to place Tahitian Noni juice, a fruit juice based on Noni (the common name for Morinda citrifolia L.), as a novel food on the market in the Community has been received. Tahitian Noni juice is a fruit juice mixture of 89 % Noni fruit (Morinda citrifolia L.) and 11 % common grape and blueberry juice concentrates and natural flavours. The applicant considers that it would be consumed in the form of fruit juice with a suggested level of consumption of 30 mL/day. Morinda citrifolia has been consumed in Polynesia and South East Asia.

40|$|The Committee {{is asked}} to assess the safety from the {{consumer}} health {{point of view of}} the leaves of Stevia Rebaudiana Bertoni as Novel Food. Background A <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>authorisation</b> to market as a novel food under Regulation 258 / 97 (EC) concerning Novel Foods and Novel Food Ingredients (2) has been received in February 1998 for the plants and dried leaves of Stevia Rebaudiana Bertoni (SRB) (1). According to the Regulation, an initial assessment of the safety from the consumer health point of view is required before marketing may be authorised. Based on this initial assessment, public health concerns have been raised by Member States. An SCF and JECFA opinion on the safety of stevioside, the main sweet principle of SRB, is available (3, 4). Nature of the novel food The genus Stevia belongs to the Asteraceae family, tribe Eupatoriae, and comprises some 150 - 300 species of perennial herbs and shrubs, growing mostly at altitudes of 500 - 3000 meters in semidry mountainous terrain. The species can also grow i...|$|E

Current social networking ecosystems allow {{third party services}} to <b>request</b> user <b>authorisation</b> <b>for</b> accessing profile data, thus enabling cross-domain recommendation. However these ecosystems create user lock-in and social networking data silos, as the profile data is neither portable nor interoperable. We argue that innovations in reconciling heterogeneous data sources must be also be matched by innovations in architecture design and recommender methodology. We present and qualitatively evaluate an architecture for privacy-enabled user profile portability, {{which is based on}} technologies from the emerging Web of Data (FOAF, WebIDs and the Web Access Control vocabulary). The proposed architecture enables the creation of a universal “private by default ” ecosystem which enables interoperability of user profile data while protecting the privacy of the user.

REACH requires manufacturers of substances of very high concern (SVHC) to <b>request</b> an <b>authorisation</b> <b>for</b> each use of these substances {{in order to continue}} marketing them. There are between 1500 and 2000 SVHC on the European market; however, to date, the European Chemicals Agency has published only 29 substances as candidates <b>for</b> the <b>authorisation</b> procedure. This work aims to contribute to the practical implementation of REACH by proposing a list of SVHC which, from a union’s perspective, should have priority for inclusion in the authorisation procedure. Methods In a first stage, SVHC for prioritisation were identified, prioritisation criteria were established, and scores for each criterion were defined for finally developing the Trade Union List. Results Through previously presented criteria, the Trade Union List includes 305 high-production-volume chemicals that meet the requirements of the authorisation process under REACH. 190 of these substances are associated with recognised occupational diseases, and 22 have been included in the REACH Candidate List. Conclusions In this paper, we present a precautionary but scientifically aligned process for identifying, scoring and ranking SVHC, including categories of substances not currently considered in other approaches to the REACH Regulation. This proposed methodology is advocated by Trade Unions to coherently prioritise SVHC in order to implement and enforce REACH {{in a way that will}} more effectively protect the health of the European working and general population...|$|R
