40|$|Problem Statement Housing {{and health}} are interconnected. By {{measuring}} the health performance of housing, risks {{can be identified}} and measures to improve the health potential can be taken. A Checklist Ventilation Quality, published by the National Tenant Organization, has been a successful “action ” promoting tool in The Netherlands. The tool gives insight in the technical quality of ventilation services {{and also in the}} quality of use. The tool improves the communication about ventilation, in relation to moisture, smell and mould problems. A spin-off is the development of the Checklist Healthy Housing, with a much broader focus than ventilation. What are the requirements of a tool that can be used both by tenants and home owners or housing institutions? How can this tool support better communication about health risks of housing and how can it promote <b>remediation?</b> <b>Objective</b> The objective of the study is to determine in what situations and how a Checklist Healthy Housing can identify health risks and promote better communication about health related technical features and occupant behavior...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Decades of {{improper}} {{disposal of}} uranium-mining wastes on the Navajo Nation {{has resulted in}} adverse human and ecological health impacts as well as socio-cultural problems. As the Navajo people become increasingly aware of the contamination problems, {{there is a need}} to develop a risk-communication strategy to properly inform tribal members of the extent and severity of the health risks. To be most effective, this strategy needs to blend accepted risk-communication techniques with Navajo perspectives such that the strategy can be used at the community level to inform culturally- and toxicologically-relevant decisions about land and water use as well as mine-waste <b>remediation.</b> <b>Objective</b> The objective of this study was to develop GIS-based thematic maps as communication tools to clearly identify high risk exposure areas and offer alternatives to minimize public and ecological health impacts. Methods Thematic maps were produced that incorporated data derived from environmental sampling and public health surveys. The maps show the location and quality of unregulated water resources and identify regulated water sources that could be used as alternatives. In addition, the maps show the location of contaminated soil and sediment areas in which disturbance of surface deposits should be avoided. Preliminary feedback was collected from an informal Navajo working group to assess the clarity and efficacy of this proposed communication method. Results The working group found the maps to be both clear and effective, and made suggestions for improvements, such as the addition of more map features. The working group predicted that once the maps are presented to the public, water hauling and soil use behaviors will change, and dialogue with chapter officials will be initiated to accelerate further risk reduction efforts. Implications Because risk communication is complicated by language barriers, lack of infrastructure, and historical mistrust of non-Navajo researchers, mapping provides an easily interpretable medium that can be objectively viewed by community members and decision makers to evaluate activities that affect toxicant exposures. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of iron sulfides in wetland soils is an acidconsuming process, which can sequester {{a range of}} trace metals and metalloids. In acid-sulfate soil wetlands, iron sulfide formation can therefore aid in neutralisation of acidity and immobilization of contaminants. For this reason, iron sulfide formation {{as a result of}} reductive S biomineralisation processes is an attractive site <b>remediation</b> <b>objective.</b> In this study, we quantified the in situ rates and products of dissimilatory SO 4 2 - reduction across a landscape-scale spatio-temporal hydrogeochemical gradient in an acid-sulfate soil wetland. The study site is an 800 ha tidal wetland that was extensively drained in the 1970 ’s. Drainage triggered in situ pyrite (FeS 2) oxidation and acidification of surface-waters and shallow groundwaters. In 2001 - 2002, a remediation program was initiated which involved progressively re-flooding the site via controlled tidal inundation. We examined spatio-temporal dynamics in S biogeochemistry at the current fringe of tidal inundation about 5 years after commencement of remediation activities. In situ SO 4 2 - reduction was confined to near-surface soil layers (to ~ 60 cm below ground surface) and occurred at rates up to ~ 300 nmol cm- 3 day- 1. Elemental S was the main short-term product of SO 4 2 - reduction, as a result of (1) reaction between S (-II) and abundant jarosite-derived Fe (III), and (2) shortterm redox oscillations near the soil surface. Sulfur K-edge XANES spectroscopy showed that S (0) (s) was abundant in near-surface soils, which corroborated selective extraction data showing S (0) (s) up to ~ 40 μmol g- 1. The iron sulfide thiospinel, greigite (Fe 3 S 4), was also an important biomineralisation product, as evident from XRD, XANES spectroscopy and analytical electron microscopy. The results are discussed in terms of thermodynamic and kinetic constraints on the spatio-temporal behaviour of S biomineralisation products, especially S (0) (s) and greigite. Dynamic tide-induced redox oscillations in near-surface soil have {{a central role in the}} formation and fate of these observed S biomineralisation products...|$|E

40|$|Decommissioning and {{remediation}} {{activities are}} subject to some common driving forces that influence the ability of decommissioning and remediation programs to achieve end-states that correspond to planned or anticipated (future) end-uses (i. e., facility or site re-use). In addition, decommissioning and remediation programs have common resources needs that, when identified and fully utilized in an integrated framework, can result in optimizing the use of available resources to achieve radiological risk-based results faster and at lower costs. To achieve this, {{it is necessary that}} the goals of individual decommissioning and remediation activities are aligned and not conflict with each other while costs are minimized and net health, safety, security and environmental benefits are maximized.

30|$|Canada is {{also aware}} of the need for a {{definition}} of ‘clean’. For DND MEC-contaminated sites, the determination of ‘clean’ is made by the Explosive Risk Rating Sub-Committee (XRRSC) on a site-by-site basis. The XRRSC is a sub-committee of the UXO Sites Working Group (UXOS WG) chaired by the UXO Program whose members include experts in UXO, munitions, and EOD. The XRRSC determines the overall risk by integrating human interaction factors - to include explosive ordnance exposure pathways and the intended use of the site - and explosive risk probabilities so that appropriate measures to reduce the risk commensurate with the end-use plan for a site can be undertaken [36]. For non-DND sites, the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment has developed a list of guiding principles for determining the numerical soil quality <b>remediation</b> <b>objectives</b> for contaminated sites. Human health, environmental quality, and land use are considered [37]. Furthermore, the CCME encourages remediation of a contaminated site to the lowest level practicable in the context of its intended land use and technological limitations. Where application of these guidelines is not possible, a risk-informed approach is used. In this way, Canada accepts that MEC-contaminated sites cannot be fully remediated and instead focuses on reducing risk, even if that risk is only qualitative.|$|R

40|$|Increasing water {{scarcity}} {{in many developing}} countries is forcing investments into remediation of water quality at the basin or sub-basin scale in order to increase water availability. Remediation decisions involving complex aquatic environments are often made in data-poor and knowledge-poor situations. <b>Remediation</b> <b>objectives</b> are often poorly articulated, raise unrealistic expectations, and cannot be evaluated in cost-benefit terms. Mathematical modelling, as a means of determining remediation options, is the usual method of choice in data-rich developed countries and requires substantial investment in reliable data, scientific capacity and a sophisticated management culture that generally are not found in developing countries. Modelling is expensive, has numerous other technical problems in developing countries, requires a high degree of input by foreign experts, and rarely leaves residual capacity in the developing country. In contrast, new techniques in knowledge-based (K-B) prediction focus on use of local and domain knowledge to establish meaningful program objectives. K-B-based decision support systems (DSS) allow the client to game with alternative remediation options with outputs expressed in degree of uncertainty in the assumptions and analytical processes included in the DSS system.

The BaSIS is comprised of a 3 -in. by 5 -in. sodium iodide (NaI) detector, differential corrected global positioning system (GPS), and portable computer, integrated into a lightweight backpack deployment platform. The system is operated with specialized software that allows the operator and/or remediation field manager to view data as they are collected. Upon completion of planned excavation stages, the area is surveyed for residual radiological contamination.

The authors show that small and prosperous Switzerland is no exception to the pervasive problem of sites contamination, the legacy of past practices in waste management having left some 38, 000 contaminated sites throughout the country. This book outlines the problem, offering evidence that open and polycentric environmental decision-making that includes civil society actors is valuable. They propose an understanding of environmental management of contaminated sites as a political process in which institutions frame interactions between strategic actors pursuing sometimes conflicting interests. In the opening chapter, the authors describe the influences of politics and the power relationships between actors involved in decision-making in contaminated sites management, which they term a "wicked problem.

40|$|A {{modeling}} {{approach is}} described for optimizing {{the design and}} operation of groundwater remediation at DNAPL sites that considers uncertainty in site and remediation system characteristics, performance and cost model limitations, and measurement uncertainties that affect predictions of remediation performance and cost. The performance model simulates performance and costs for thermal source zone treatment and enhanced bioremediation with statistical compliance rules and real-time operational system monitoring. An inverse solution is employed to estimate model parameters, parameter covariances, and residual prediction error from site data and a stochastic cost optimization algorithm determines design and operation variables that minimize expected net present value cost over Monte Carlo realizations. The method is implemented in the program SCOToolkit. A series of applications to a hypothetical problem yielded expected cost reductions for site remediation as much as 85 % compared to conventional non-optimized approaches, while also increasing the probability of achieving “no further action” status in a specified timeframe by more than 60 %. Optimizing monitoring frequency for compliance wells used to make no further action determinations as well as operational monitoring used to make decisions on individual remediation system components reveals tradeoffs between increased direct costs for sampling and analysis versus decreased construction and operating costs that arise because more data increases decision reliability. Optimizing protocols for operational monitoring and heating unit shutdown protocols for thermal source treatment (incremental versus all-or-none shutdown, soil versus groundwater sampling, number and frequency of samples) produced cost savings of more than 20 %. Defining compliance based on confidence limits of a moving time window regression decreased expected cost and lowered failure probability compared to using measured extreme values over a lookback period.

The line {{of the top of}} the bank has regressed severely in recent years, overbank flooding occurs to depths of approximately 1 metre at the site during major floods, and local landholders are concerned about channel breakout and a river course change through their farms. Access to the popular recreational fishing and boating site at Kierle Landing, downstream of the site may also be disrupted in a channel breakout. The Burdekin Shire Rivers Improvement Trust wishes to consider the need for, and the benefit / cost of remediation at the site. This study incorporates a concept level evaluation that assesses the problems and their causes, and examines the <b>remediation</b> <b>objectives</b> and the potential remediation options. The study follows the principles and practices presented in Stream Stabilisation for Rehabilitation in North-East Queensland(Kapitzke et al., in press), and covers Steps 1 to 5 of the recommended 10 -Step Planning, Design and Implementation Process for stream stabilisation and rehabilitation. A concept level evaluation of this nature provides a broad preliminary assessment of the problems and solutions, sufficient to allow decisions to be made to proceed with more detailed studies or to adopt a non intervention approach. This study is limited by a shortage of available data and does not include detailed investigations into the configuration, layout and suitability of alternative remediation options, nor does it include comprehensive geomorphological and economic analyses of the likelihood and consequence of channel breakout and damage to farms, infrastructure etc. These types of investigations are more appropriate to the detailed feasibility studies that would be required to confirm assessments before implementation of any of the remedial programs discussed here...|$|R

Non-optimized forward simulations based on calibrated parameters and their uncertainty inferred from data prior to actual thermal source remediation system implementation at the site indicated a low probability of the actual thermal system design meeting remediation criteria in a reasonable time frame. Calibration using additional data collected during thermal treatment reduced prediction uncertainty, but still predicted a high probability of taking more than 100 years to reach compliance criteria using the actual thermal treatment design with no additional remedial action. Stochastic optimization of the thermal treatment design indicated larger treatment areas were needed to capture source mass due to uncertainty in source delineation. The expected cost for the enlarged thermal treatment system {{was estimated to be}} $ 22 M, which is nearly twice that of the actual system, suggesting that additional characterization to reduce source delineation uncertainty or consideration of an alternative strategy that is less sensitive to delineation uncertainty may be warranted. Stochastic optimization of whey injection was investigated to accelerate source zone dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) dissolution and enhance dissolved plume biodecay. The optimized design indicated a 93 % probability of meeting compliance criteria by 2100 with an expected net present value cost of $ 4. 7 M. Whey injection substantially shortened the remediation time compared to no whey injection. The results indicate that the proposed stochastic cost optimization approach is able to reduce expected remediation costs, increase the probability of achieving <b>remediation</b> <b>objectives,</b> and identify data characterization needs...|$|R
40|$|This work applies {{deterministic}} and probabilistic methodology to {{the analysis}} of health risk of a contaminated site. The risks we have calculated are both cancerogenous and no-cancerogenous. The area we studied was formerly used for chemical industry, and is called “Pertusola South Crotone”. Due to its high concentrations of heavy metals it has been declared “area of national interest”. The receptors we have considered are adults, children and workers. As point where the target is exposed to the contamination we have taken the coast line. The contaminants that were considered are As, Cd y Zn. A mathematical model is utilized for the simulation of destination and transportation of contaminants from the point of origin of the contamination to that of exposition. The methodology of risk analysis is applied in direct and inverse way. The direct calculation allows the estimate of health risk to which the target is exposed in presence of a strong contamination. The inverse calculation makes possible to determine the maximum acceptable contamination of the target, compatible with an acceptable level of risk. The deterministic methodology has been used to calculate the RME and MLE values. The probabilistic one (based on Monte Carlo method) has been used to calculate the estimated average value, UCL 95 %, UCL 99 %. If the exposition rate RME is considered and deterministic and probabilistic results are compared, one obtains an overestimate of the risk {{in the case of the}} deterministic values. The probabilistic calculation allows to fulfil less conservative <b>remediation</b> <b>objectives.</b> This leads to a lower cost of the remediation work. From the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis one finds that toxicological factors contribute to the risk equation more than hydrogeological factors.

40|$|The Dene Hamlet of Tulita {{is located}} {{east of the}} Great Bear Lake, at the {{junction}} of the Mackenzie and Great Bear Rivers, in the Sahtu region of the Northwest Territories. For 22 years, this Hamlet hosted a power generating plant whose operations, together with some accidental petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) spills, caused {{a high level of}} soil contamination, specifically in the peat layer found in the soil. The dismantling of the former power plant and subsequent decommissioning of the site required that the site be remediated. Project challenges stemmed from the high level of soil contamination (up to 185, 000 mg/kg in the peat layer) and the remote location of the community, which is only accessible by plane and barge during the short summer season. As the site was located {{in the center of the}} Hamlet, efforts were made to minimize the project impacts (odours, noise, dust, safety) to the surrounding community members. The project commenced in June 2002. The remediation guidelines used were Canada-Wide Standards (CWS) for PHC in soil, from the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME). In order to achieve the <b>remediation</b> <b>objectives</b> established for this project, Biogenie used its proprietary treatment process, the In situ Biopile. A volume of 8, 100 m 3 was treated inside the land treatment area (LTA) at an average depth of 3. 0 m below ground surface. At the start of the project, the average PHC (Fractions 1 to 4) concentration was 12, 500 mg/kg (n = 26). After 14 months of treatment, this concentration was reduced to 2, 496 mg/kg (n = 27) representing an average removal rate of 80 %. This paper outlines each major stage of the project, focusing mainly on the technical and human challenges that were encountered and how they were overcome...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the Mediterranean area, {{surface waters}} often have low {{discharge}} or renewal rates, hence metal contamination from industrialised catchments {{can have a}} high {{negative impact on the}} physico-chemical and biological water quality. In a context of climate and anthropological changes, it is necessary to provide an integrative approach for the prevention and control of metal pollution, in order to limit its impact on water resources, biodiversity, trophic network and human health. For this purpose, introduction of constructed wetlands (CWs) between natural aquatic ecosystems and industrialised zones or catchments is a promising strategy for eco-remediation. Analysis of the literature has shown that further research must be done to improve CW design, selection and management of wetland plant species and catchment organisation, in order to ensure the effectiveness of CWs in Mediterranean environments. Firstly, the parameters of basin design that have the greatest influence on metal removal processes must be identified, in order to better focus rhizospheric processes on specific purification objectives. We have summarised in a single diagram the relationships between the design parameters of a CW basin and the physico-chemical and biological processes of metal removal, on the basis of 21 mutually consistent papers. Secondly, in order to optimise the selection and distribution of helophytes in CWs, it is necessary to identify criteria of choice for the plant species that will best fit the <b>remediation</b> <b>objectives</b> and environmental and economic constraints. We have analysed the factors determining plant metal uptake efficiency in CWs {{on the basis of a}} qualitative meta-analysis of 13 studies with a view to determine whether the part played by metal uptake by plants is relevant in comparison with the other removal processes. Thirdly, we analysed the parameters to consider for establishing suitable management strategies for CWs and how they affect the whole CW design process. Finally, we propose monitoring and policy measures to facilitate the integration of CWs within Mediterranean industrialised catchments...|$|R
40|$|The {{gas phase}} is {{generally}} ignored in remediation of metals and radionuclides {{because it is}} assumed that there is no efficient way to exploit it. In the literal sense, all remediations involve the gas phase because this phase is linked to the liquid and solid phases by vapor pressure and thermodynamic relationships. Remediation methods that specifically use the gas phase as a central feature have primarily targeted volatile organic contaminants, not metals and radionuclides. Unlike many organic contaminants, the vapor pressure and Henry's Law constants of metals and radionuclides are not generally conducive to direct air stripping of dissolved contaminants. Nevertheless, the gas phase can {{play an important role in}} remediation of inorganic contaminants and provide opportunities for efficient, cost effective <b>remediation.</b> The <b>objective</b> here is to explore ways in which manipulation of the gas phase can be used to facilitate remediation of metals and radionuclides...|$|R

40|$|In 1999 Soil-use {{specific}} <b>Remediation</b> <b>Objectives</b> (SRO) {{were derived}} for eight metals, PAHs, DDT and drins {{as part of}} the new soil clean-up policy. The SROs represent the minimal degree soil quality in the topsoil after remediation. Derived values are implemented in the policies for soil remediation and soil management. Evaluating this underpinning of the SRO was found necessary for the following reasons: 1) the issue of availability of new (toxicity) data and revised methods, 2) lack of specific toxicity data for plants and adequate risk levels for secondary poisoning, 3) lack of a method to derive a criterion to guarantee the quality of compost from contaminated soil, 4) uncertainty about the ecological impact of using the generic ecological criterion, HC 50. The report focuses on the soil quality criteria for humans, phytotoxicity, secondary poisoning, the generic ecological soil quality criterion and a criterion for maintaining the quality of compost. Several conclusions have arisen from this evaluation. First, when only new data and methods are implemented, derived SROs for soil-use category I need to be slightly changed for chromium, DDT/DDE and PAHs, while derived SROs for soil-use category II need to be changed for most compounds. Secondly, new data on phytotoxicity have made it possible to derive a criterion for phytotoxicity for cadmium, lead, chromium and nickel. However, taking secondary poisoning into account derived risk limits are shown to be lower for cadmium, lead, mercury, methyl-mercury and zinc. Thirdly, the method developed to derive soil quality criteria for producing good-quality compost leads {{to the conclusion that the}} SRO should be lowered for arsenic, zinc and mercury. For zinc, though, the current quality standard is already considered very stringent for practical use. In the investigation on the ecological relevance of HC 50 by comparing laboratory toxicity data with field toxicity data, the field data, in general, were concluded to be slightly higher. It was recommended to use more field toxicity data to be able to carry out a more extensive study. Many aspects like bioavailability influence this comparison. Although the current generic ecological criterion (HC 50) does not guarantee the unhampered functioning of the ecosystems, it was chosen as an acceptable standard. For the future, deriving ecological criteria based on specific protection goals is advisory. To reduce the uncertainty and risk to ecosystems, it was recommended to use the lower limit (when available) of the 90 %-confidence interval for HC 50 (LLHC 50) as the generic ecological soil quality criterion. This use will lead to more stringent SROs for most compounds...|$|R

Therefore, we will offer additional, substantive comments after the forthcoming supplement to the EPA Report (the “EPA Addendum”) is released. We reserve the right to modify anything presented in these comments, to the extent necessary to account for new information or analyses provided in the EPA Addendum. Most importantly, we believe that all parties concerned with a successful project outcome must never lose focus on the endgame — the <b>remediation</b> action <b>objectives</b> outlined in the landmark 2002 Record of Decision (ROD).

40|$|Phytoremediation {{is one of}} {{chemical}} removal methods {{but this is a}} long term process. Nanotechnology is a novelty method {{that can be used for}} toxic <b>remediation.</b> The <b>objective</b> of this study aimed to determine Trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2 -amino- 4, 6 -dinitrotoluene (2 -ADNT) and 4 -amino- 2, 6 -dinitrotoluene (4 -ADNT) translocation in shoots and roots based on the nano-phytoremediation experiments. For methodology, the transplantation method of Panicum maximum (Purple guinea grass) were selected for this study. The plants were transferred and grown in the soil that was spiked with TNT with concentrations of 100 and 500 mg/kg and also added with nanoscale zero valent iron (nZVI) with concentrations of 100, 500, and 1000 mg/kg. The determination of TNT accumulation in Panicum maximum was carried out after harvesting at the end of 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, and 4 th months. The plants were divided into shoots and roots for the measurements of TNT and its metabolite residue concentrations. The present study can be concluded that the TNT uptake by roots in nZVI added soil was more effective than that without nZVI, particularly, the experiments with TNT concentration of 500 mg/kg. The results also showed that TNT was found in roots higher than that in shoots in all experimental groups. The 2 -ADNT and 4 -ADNT were only found in roots in all sets of the experiments. Both metabolites were undetectable in shoots...|$|R
