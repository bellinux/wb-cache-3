We provide {{an account of the}} attested fluctuation among <b>raising,</b> <b>control,</b> and impersonal constructions based on the Case- and θ-properties of the structures involved in each dialect. We also discuss the pervasive spreading of raising constructions (including cases of overt and “covert ” hyper-raising) in Brazilian Portuguese and its relation to the loss of referential null subjects in this dialect...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} whether {{strategies of}} reproductive allocation may reduce long-term immunocompetence through {{the effects of}} manipulated effort on secondary or acquired immunity. We tested whether increased reproductive effort leads to reduced immune function and survival by manipulating brood size in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and exposing breeding females to a primary and secondary exposure of sheep red blood cells to elicit a humoral immune response. Females raising enlarged broods produced fewer secondary antibodies than did females <b>raising</b> <b>control</b> or reduced broods. Most importantly, individuals with high secondary responses {{were more likely to}} survive to breed 3 years after brood manipulations, suggesting that differences in disease susceptibility may be caused by trade-offs in reproductive allocation. We also found that individual quality, measured by clutch initiation date, mediated the effects of brood manipulations, with higher-quality birds showing a greater ability to deal with increases in effort...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{investigate}} the successfulness of the traditional tests used to distinguish between <b>Raising</b> and <b>Control</b> predicates. Moreover, the study also aims to examine how well these tests comply with the movement theory on Control. The study is based on the Principles and Parameters approach to grammar. Since the aim of the study is to investigate these tests’ compliance with the movement theory on Control, this theory is also discussed in the present study. To investigate authentic uses of <b>Raising</b> and <b>Control</b> predicates a qualitative corpus method has been used. A total number of 1200 sentences have been studied. Furthermore, the native speaker’s judgement task has been used to judge the grammaticality of a set of representative sentences. The results show that the tests used to distinguish between <b>Raising</b> and <b>Control</b> predicates are at most times effective in fulfilling their task. However, some of these tests have their own limits which need to be taken into consideration. Moreover, the results also shows that the traditional tests comply with the movement theory on Control...|$|R

Chronically centrifuged rats (Group CC) spent as much time at 2. 0 g as at 1. 0 g while normally <b>raised</b> <b>controls</b> (Group NC) selecdonly 1. 0 g. Group CC initially selected 2. 0 g and a preference for 1. 0 g developed over the four test sessions. These results suggest that hypergravity is not necessarily an aversive stimulus and that gravity preference may depend initially upon the reference level involved. The ultimate selection of 1. 0 g by chronically centrifuged animals suggests that a preference for a familiar gravity environment is replaced by a preference for low-gravity stimuli...|$|R
50|$|Combat in King's Bounty {{occurs when}} sieging an {{occupied}} castle or engaging a wandering army {{on the main}} map. Combat turns are simple, with the player's army moving first, followed by the opponent's. Armies are stack-based, with any one stack taking up one square on the battlefield. Stacks can represent anything from one cavalry unit to thousands of peasants. The player can use a number of either Adventuring spells, only used in the overworld, or Combat spells. Adventuring spells allow movement to Towns, Castles, create bridges, increase leadership (<b>Raise</b> <b>Control),</b> stop time for some number of moves, finds the villain at a castle, or creates an army stack if the player has a space (Instant Army). During combat, the player can cast one spell per turn that cause damage via lightning, fireball, or turn undead, can resurrect dead troops, teleport a friendly or enemy unit to an open position, freeze an enemy unit so it cannot move, or increase an existing troop through cloning (Clone).|$|R
40|$|The paper {{develops}} a simple economic {{model of a}} biological invasion. The natural growth of the invasion is non-convex and the immediate cost of controlling the invasion depends {{on the level of}} current control as well as the current size of the invasion. Greater <b>control</b> <b>raises</b> <b>control</b> costs today while reducing damages - now and in the future. In addition, by decreasing the size of the invasion, increased <b>control</b> today <b>raises</b> the marginal cost of control in the future. As a consequence, the optimal path of an invasion is not necessarily monotonic. When the marginal control cost declines sharply with the size of invasion, it may be optimal to allow an invasion to grow naturally before it is controlled. We characterize conditions under which it is optimal to eradicate an invasive species (immediately and eventually) and conditions under which it is optimal to manage an invasion without complete eradication.

40|$|Since Pollard and Sag (1994) it {{has been}} assumed that raising {{involves}} full structure sharing, whereas a control verb merely shares content information {{of one of the}} lower verb’s arguments. In this paper we discuss the difference between <b>raising</b> and <b>control</b> from the perspective of Dutch and German passives. It has already been shown by Van Noord and Kordoni (2005) that the secondary object passives in these languages are raising structures, in which the case of the raised argument changes. In this paper we provide additional evidence for the raising analysis, and we propose a new analysis, which allows for a uniform account of Dutch and German passives as raising structures. Przepiórkowski and Rosen (2004) show that control may exhibit case transmission; the data presented in this paper shows that raising may not. Therefore, we claim that the distinction between <b>raising</b> and <b>control</b> is found in theta-role assignment. Syntactically they tend to behave differently, but they may also behave in the exact same way. ...|$|R

Introduction Control systems with a Lie group as a state space are studied in the mathematical control theory since the early 1970 -ies. R. W.

40|$|The {{existence}} of empty categories is controversial, both in syntactic theory and theories of sentence processing. Indeed, {{the structure of}} the infinitival complements of <b>raising</b> and <b>control</b> predicates differs between linguistic theories such as Principles and Parameters (PPT), Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) and Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG). Although data from experimental psycholinguistic studies can potentially inform this linguistic debate, previous research on the processing of empty categories in <b>raising</b> and <b>control</b> structures has elicited contradictory results (e. g. Featherston, 2001; Walenski, 2003). This paper reports on the results of an exploratory study investigating the processing of (subject and object) <b>control</b> and <b>raising</b> structures and their purported empty categories (PRO and DP-trace respectively), conducted through an offline sentence complexity-rating task and an online self-paced reading experiment, using materials as illustrated below: Object control: It was the athlete in the first team the coach asked to race with the world champion Subject control: It was the athlete in the first team the coach tried to race with in the last competitio...|$|R
