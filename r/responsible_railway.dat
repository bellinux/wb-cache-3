50|$|The Prussian {{government}} {{rejected the}} project on 8 June 1879, as it was first focussing {{on the construction of}} main lines. The explanatory report continued to serve as a template for its possible construction. On 10 May 1880, a railway committee was founded in Bad Oeynhausen to campaign {{for the construction of a}} railway from Osnabrück to Brackwede. It basically adopted the route of the explanatory report, but the line would be able to be extended to Detmold and Bergheim. Eleven people were constantly involved with the railway committee, including Mayor Brüning of Osnabrück and Mayor Huber of Bielefeld. On the very day of the founding of the committee, it wrote a letter to the Royal Ministry of Public Works (Königliche Staatsministerium für öffentliche Arbeiten). In this letter, it again described the necessity of building the railway. The <b>responsible</b> <b>railway</b> administration now endorsed the project but demanded a grant of 10,000 marks per kilometre for the construction of the line. It was subsequently agreed that the payment would be 3,000 marks per km, with the municipalities and companies agreeing to participate in the payment.|$|E
