25|$|A strike {{beginning}} on November 6, 2008 concerned {{a variety of}} institutional grievances, including job security for contract professors, elimination of the Non-Academic Student Code of Conduct, creation of whistleblower protection, and fund indexation. On January 20, 2009, CUPE 3903 defeated a forced ratification vote that would have ended the strike. On January 24, Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty announced a rare Sunday recall of the provincial legislature in order to pass back-to-work legislation mandating an immediate end to the strike. On January 29, the York University Labour Disputes <b>Resolution</b> <b>Act</b> was passed in the provincial parliament on a count of 42–8 ending the long 85-day strike and setting a precedent for future university strikes in Ontario.|$|E
500|$|She {{spent much}} of her first term {{focusing}} on constituency issues, among them championing the 2013 Pyrite <b>Resolution</b> <b>Act,</b> a €50m compensation scheme for homes affected by the use of pyrite in their construction. She also secured funding for the Slane bypass, as well as increased funding for schools and local community sports projects. In addition, McEntee campaigned for improvements to mobile broadband coverage in Meath, and was a vocal supporter of the local agricultural industry. She campaigned for a yes vote in the 2015 referendum concerning the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the Republic of Ireland, and voted in favour of the proposed abolition of Seanad Éireann, the upper house of the Irish parliament. Following a random audit of 22 members of the Oireachtas in 2014, she was one of five politicians required to repay expenses they had claimed that had been declared ineligible. She described the episode, which resulted in her having to repay £1,675.88 of expenses, as being a result of [...] "human error".|$|E

Also, along with the new Tilt elements introduced, the biggest difference in Act Two is that instead of giving away the Resolution die, the player keeps it.

30|$|This {{study shows}} that breath-by-breath changes in EMG across ten leg muscles {{can be used as}} a good {{estimate}} of changes in metabolic power in non steady-state conditions. Estimations of metabolic changes on a cycle-by-cycle basis may also be reasonable given that breath-by-breath <b>resolution</b> <b>acts</b> as a moving average of approximately three to four pedal cycles, thereby maintaining the important features of the data. This has implications for future studies and applications involving EMG from large muscle groups during dynamic activities as it provides higher temporal resolution and more real-time predictions of changes in metabolic power than gas exchange measures. Also, metabolic power estimated from gas exchange is used in calculations of mechanical efficiency, which implies that breath-by-breath changes in EMG can also be used to investigate the relationship of mechanical work and metabolic power.|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{prospects}} of measuring the CP violating phase with atmospheric neutrinos at a large magnetized iron calorimeter detector considering the muons (directly measurable) of the neutrino events generated by a MonteCarlo event generator Nuance. The effect of θ_ 13 and δ_CP appears dominantly neither in atmospheric neutrino oscillation nor in solar neutrino oscillation, but appears as subleading in both cases. These are observable in range of E ∼ 1 GeV for atmospheric neutrino, where solar and atmospheric oscillation couple. In this regime, the quasi-elastic events dominate and the energy resolution is very good, but the angular resolution is very poor. Unlike beam experiments this poor angular <b>resolution</b> <b>acts</b> against its measurements. However, we find that one can be able to distinguish δ_CP≈ 0 ^∘ and 180 ^∘ at 90...|$|R
