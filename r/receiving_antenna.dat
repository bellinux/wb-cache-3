25|$|Radar is an object-detection {{system that}} uses radio waves to {{determine}} the range, angle, or velocity of objects.

A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a <b>receiving</b> <b>antenna</b> (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object's location and speed.|$|E

The G-series fuselage was purpose-built for {{the special needs of}} a night fighter, with the A-series' Bola ventral under-nose defensive gun position omitted for lower aerodynamic drag and less weight, and adding the enlarged squared-off vertical fin/rudder tail unit of the Ju 188. G-1 aircraft possessed more powerful armament and like the earlier R-1, used a pair of 1,700PS BMW 801 radial engines, the G-1 using the later BMW 801G-2 version.

25|$|As {{a crystal}} radio has no power supply, the sound power {{produced}} by the earphone comes solely from the transmitter of the radio station being received, via the radio waves captured by the antenna. The power available to a <b>receiving</b> <b>antenna</b> decreases with the square of its distance from the radio transmitter. Even for a powerful commercial broadcasting station, if {{it is more than}} {{a few miles from the}} receiver the power received by the antenna is very small, typically measured in microwatts or nanowatts. In modern crystal sets, signals as weak as 50 picowatts at the antenna can be heard. Crystal radios can receive such weak signals without using amplification only due to the great sensitivity of human hearing, which can detect sounds with an intensity of only 10−16 W/cm2. Therefore, crystal receivers have to be designed to convert the energy from the radio waves into sound waves as efficiently as possible. Even so, they are usually only able to receive stations within distances of about 25 miles for AM broadcast stations, although the radiotelegraphy signals used during the wireless telegraphy era could be received at hundreds of miles, and crystal receivers were even used for transoceanic communication during that period.|$|E

2500|$|In EMF {{measurements}} applications, an isotropic receiver (also called isotropic antenna) is a calibrated {{radio receiver}} with an antenna which approximates an isotropic reception pattern; that is, it has close to equal sensitivity to radio waves from any direction. [...] It {{is used as}} a field measurement instrument to measure electromagnetic sources and calibrate antennas.

2500|$|Far-field or {{radiative}} region – Beyond about 1 wavelength (λ) of the antenna, {{the electric}} and magnetic fields are perpendicular {{to each other}} and propagate as an electromagnetic wave; examples are radio waves, microwaves, or light waves. [...] This part of the energy is radiative, meaning it leaves the antenna {{whether or not there is}} a receiver to absorb it. [...] The portion of energy which does not strike the <b>receiving</b> <b>antenna</b> is dissipated and lost to the system. The amount of power emitted as electromagnetic waves by an antenna depends on the ratio of the antenna's size Dant to the wavelength of the waves λ, which is determined by the frequency: λ=c/f. [...] At low frequencies f where the antenna is much smaller than the size of the waves, Dant<<nbsp&λ, very little power is radiated. [...] Therefore the near-field devices above, which use lower frequencies, radiate almost none of their energy as electromagnetic radiation. [...] Antennas about the same size as the wavelength [...] Dantnbsp&≈nbsp&λ [...] such as monopole or dipole antennas, [...] radiate power efficiently, but the electromagnetic waves are radiated in all directions (omnidirectionally), so if the <b>receiving</b> <b>antenna</b> is far away, only a small amount of the radiation will hit it.

2500|$|A typical {{parabolic}} antenna {{consists of a}} metal parabolic reflector with a small feed antenna suspended {{in front of the}} reflector at its focus, pointed back toward the reflector. The reflector is a metallic surface formed into a paraboloid of revolution and usually truncated in a circular rim that forms the diameter of the antenna. [...] In a transmitting antenna, radio frequency current from a transmitter is supplied through a transmission line cable to the feed antenna, which converts it into radio waves. [...] The radio waves are emitted back toward the dish by the feed antenna and reflect off the dish into a parallel beam. In a <b>receiving</b> <b>antenna</b> the incoming radio waves bounce off the dish and are focused to a point at the feed antenna, which converts them to electric currents which travel through a transmission line to the radio receiver.|$|E

2500|$|If {{the signal}} from one {{polarization}} channel is {{received by the}} oppositely polarized antenna, it will cause crosstalk that degrades the signal-to-noise ratio. [...] The ability of an antenna to keep these orthogonal channels separate is measured by a parameter called cross polarization discrimination (XPD). [...] In a transmitting antenna, XPD is the fraction of power from an antenna of one polarization radiated in the other polarization. [...] For example, due to minor imperfections a dish with a vertically polarized feed antenna will radiate {{a small amount of}} its power in horizontal polarization; this fraction is the XPD. [...] In a <b>receiving</b> <b>antenna,</b> the XPD is the ratio of signal power received of the opposite polarization to power received in the same antenna of the correct polarization, when the antenna is illuminated by two orthogonally polarized radio waves of equal power. [...] If the antenna system has inadequate XPD, cross polarization interference cancelling [...] (XPIC) digital signal processing algorithms can often be used to decrease crosstalk.|$|E
