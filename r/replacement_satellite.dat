25|$|During May 2005, B-SAT ordered BSAT-3a, the <b>replacement</b> <b>satellite</b> for BSAT-1a and BSAT-1b. It was {{successfully}} launched on August 2007, and {{accepted into the}} fleet the next month. During November, 2007 BSAT-3a took over the broadcasting of analog and digital signals from BSAT-1a and BSAT-1b. In 3 August 2010, BSAT-1a {{was placed in a}} graveyard orbit and decommissioned.|$|E
25|$|The Swiss {{producer}} of both onboard clocktypes SpectraTime declined to comment. According to ESA they concluded with their industrial partners for the rubidium atomic clocks some implemented testing and operational measures were required. Additionally some refurbishment {{is required for}} the rubidium atomic clocks that still have to be launched. For the passive hydrogen masers operational measures are being studied {{to reduce the risk of}} failure. China and India use the same SpectraTime-built atomic clocks in their satellite navigation systems. ESA has contacted the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) who initially reported not having experienced similar failures. However, at the end of January 2017, Indian news outlets reported that all three clocks aboard the IRNSS-1A satellite (launched in July 2013 with a 10-year life expectancy) had failed and that a <b>replacement</b> <b>satellite</b> would be launched in the second half of 2017.|$|E
5000|$|Galaxy 26 {{was officially}} de-orbited on June 7, 2014. [...] The {{satellite}} was originally scheduled for de-orbit around March 15, 2014, but that date was extended following {{delays in the}} launch of two <b>replacement</b> <b>satellites.</b>|$|R
40|$|A concept {{called the}} {{low-cost}} modular spacecraft, {{in which the}} subsystems would be contained in replaceable modules and which {{would be capable of}} various applications, is under engineering development. Studies have shown that servicing of such a spacecraft on orbit by the Space Shuttle over an extended lifetime is more economical than three other alternatives: launching <b>replacement</b> <b>satellites</b> on conventional boosters as existing <b>satellites</b> fail, launching <b>replacements</b> by Shuttle, or launching <b>replacement</b> <b>satellites</b> and retrieving malfunctioning satellites by Shuttle. For on-orbit servicing, the Shuttle would use its Remote Manipulator system (RMS) to bring the malfunctioning satellite into its cargo bay. The Flight Support System (FSS) on the Orbiter used for servicing the satellite would include an appendage storage frame, a retention cradle, a positioning platform, a Module Exchange Mechanism (MEM), and a storage magazine. Ground simulations are under way with the Orbiter mockup...|$|R

50|$|Three Rubidium atomic clocks {{on board}} IRNSS-1A failed with first failure {{occurring}} in July 2016 followed by failure {{of two other}} clocks.

50|$|On February 24, 2009, a Taurus XL rocket failed {{during the}} launch of the $270m Orbiting Carbon Observatory spacecraft. Liftoff {{occurred}} successfully at 09:55 GMT from Vandenberg Air Force Base, but data received at a later stage of the flight suggested that the fairing failed to separate.

40|$|The multihundred {{kilowatt}} {{electrical power}} {{aspects of a}} mannable space platform in low Earth orbit is analyzed from a cost and technology viewpoint. At the projected orbital altitudes, Shuttle launch and servicing are technically and economically viable. Power generation is specified as photovoltaic consistent with projected planning. The cost models and trades are based upon a zero interest rate (the government taxes concurrently as required), constant dollars (1980), and costs derived {{in the first half}} of 1980. Space platform utilization of up to 30 years is evaluated to fully understand the impact of resupply and <b>replacement</b> as <b>satellite</b> missions are extended. Such lifetimes are potentially realizable with Shuttle servicing capability and are economically desirable...|$|R
40|$|The NOAA {{series of}} {{meteorological}} satellites that carry the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) suffer from orbital drift so that during each satellite's duty period the overpass time occurs {{later in the}} day. <b>Replacement</b> <b>satellites</b> restore the overpass time temporarily, but then it gradually decays. The goals of this paper are to document the effects of variable observation time owing to orbital drift on brightness temperatures (BT) and land surface temperature (LST) calculated from them in the NOAA/NASA Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL) data set and to consider possible corrections for the resulting trends and discontinuities in the PAL BT data. The drift effects {{were found to be}} greater for bare ground than for vegetated land cover classes, however significant effects were found for most vegetated classes. The magnitude of the orbital drift effect for most global cover types was at least as large as the other errors that affect LST measurement. A simple empirical correction for observation time based on solar zenith angle (SZA) was used to correct the PAL BT time series following Gutman [Int. J. Remote Sens. 20 (1999 a) 3407]. The correction from this method was compared with that predicted by a physically based model and was found to differ {{in the early part of}} each satellite's duty cycle. Finally, the impacts of correction on the effective observation time were analyzed and the simple statistical correction was found to suffer from greater variability than has hitherto been recognized. A modification to the statistical correction to adjust the effective observation time is described. D 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|CryoSat was {{launched}} from Site 133/3 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome at 15:02:00 UTC on 8 October 2005. The launch {{was conducted by}} Eurockot, using a Rokot carrier rocket with a Briz-KM upper stage. The command {{to shut down the}} rocket's second stage engine was missing from the flight control system, and consequently the stage burned to depletion. This prevented the second stage from separating from the Briz-KM, and as a result the rocket was unable to achieve orbit. It reentered over the Arctic Ocean, north of Greenland. A <b>replacement</b> <b>satellite,</b> CryoSat-2, was successfully launched in 2010.|$|E
50|$|The {{network in}} its early years was not as robust as it is now.

Fortunately, during the Apollo 11 moonwalk, the moon was over the Pacific Ocean, and so other antennas were used, as well as INTELSAT III, which was in geostationary orbit over the Pacific.|$|E

50|$|In 2017 it was {{announced}} that all three rubidium atomic clocks on board IRNSS-1A had failed, mirroring similar failures in the Galileo constellation. The first failure occurred in , following which two other clocks also failed. This rendered the satellite somewhat redundant and required <b>replacement.</b> Although the <b>satellite</b> still performs other functions, the data is coarse, and thus cannot be used for accurate measurements.

50|$|A {{total of}} 35 {{satellites}} were launched by ORBCOMM Global {{in the mid}} to late 1990s. Of the original 35, a total of 24 remain operational today, according to company filings. The plane F polar satellite, one of the original prototype first generation satellites launched in 1995, was retired in April 2007 due to intermittent service. Two additional satellites (one from each of Plane B and Plane D) were retired in 2008 also due to intermittent service. The other five satellites that are not operational experienced failures earlier. The absence of these eight satellites can increase system latency and decrease overall capacity. ORBCOMM has invested in <b>replacement</b> <b>satellites</b> as the first generation is at or nearing end of life. On 19 June 2008 six additional ORBCOMM satellites were launched with the Cosmos-3M rocket: one ORBCOMM CDS weighing 80 kg, and five ORBCOMM Quick Launches weighing 115 kg each. These new satellites were built by German OHB System AG (platform) and by Orbital Sciences Corporation (payload) and included a secondary AIS. Design and production of the satellite platform was subcontracted by OHB System to Russian KB Polyot. On November 9, 2009 ORBCOMM filed a report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stating that since launch, communications capability for three of the quick-launch satellites and the CDS has been lost. The failed satellites experienced attitude control system anomalies as well as anomalies with its power systems, which resulted in the satellites not pointing towards the sun and the earth as expected and as a consequence have reduced power generation. The company filed a $50 million claim with its insurers covering the loss of all six satellites and received $44.5 million in compensation.|$|R
