5|$|Human <b>{{research}}</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> San Buenaventura area {{goes back}} to Stelzner 1885, mineral-focused research in 1895 and Penck 1920. The La Hoyada Formation was identified 1963 and reinterpreted as the La Hoyada volcanic complex in 2000. General geological <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region occurred 1988, 2000 and 2006, and research focused on Cerro Blanco was done by Arnosio et al. 2005 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{study of}} plant {{resistance}} to herbivory was first covered extensively in 1951 by Reginald (R.H.)

While this work pioneered further <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US, the work of Chesnokov was the basis of further <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> USSR.|$|E

5|$|Although {{important}} discoveries {{continued to}} elude Lawrence's Radiation Laboratory, mainly {{due to its}} focus {{on the development of}} the cyclotron rather than its scientific use, through his increasingly larger machines, Lawrence was able to provide crucial equipment needed for experiments in high energy physics. Around this device, he built what became the world's foremost laboratory for the new field of nuclear physics <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s. He received a patent for the cyclotron in 1934, which he assigned to the Research Corporation, a private foundation that funded much of Lawrence's early work.|$|E

5|$|Anderson {{and colleagues}} from St Thomas' Hospital, London, {{were the first}} to mention a case with {{possible}} clinical findings of LEMS in 1953, but Lambert, Eaton, and Rooke at the Mayo Clinic were the first physicians to substantially describe the clinical and electrophysiological findings of the disease in 1956. In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity. Studies in the 1980s confirmed the autoimmune nature, and <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s demonstrated the link with antibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels.|$|E

A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which {{suggested}} they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they {{had not been able to}} fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E
