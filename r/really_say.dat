500|$|... "Losing My Religion" [...] {{is based}} on Peter Buck's mandolin-playing. Buck said, [...] "The verses {{are the kinds of}} things R.E.M. uses a lot, going from one minor to another, kind [...] like those 'Driver 8' chords. You can't <b>really</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} bad about E minor, A minor, D, and G– I mean, they're just good chords." [...] Buck noted that [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was [...] "probably the most typical R.E.M.-sounding song on the record. We are trying to get away from those kind of songs, but like I said before, those are some good chords." [...] Orchestral strings play through parts of the song. The song is in natural minor.|$|E
500|$|For his dance, Park {{highlights}} Art of Movement, Skill Methods, and Massive Monkees as b-boy crews {{that influence}} him. He also cites Andrew Baterina from SoReal Cru; Movement Lifestyle's members Keone Madrid, Lyle Beniga, and Shaun Evaristo; Ian Eastwood; and Twitch. Park is also inspired by Taiwanese-American NBA player Jeremy Lin, saying that Lin [...] "was off the radar and now he’s {{playing with the}} best of the best. People can’t hate on him even though they want to because he’s so good. That’s how a K-pop star has to be over in America if they want to succeed. They have to be so good in every single way that even if people hate, they can’t <b>really</b> <b>say</b> anything".|$|E
500|$|The {{next three}} seasons {{were not as}} {{successful}} as the previous three for either Thome or the Indians. In July 1998, Thome hit his 24th home run of that season while helping the Indians end the Yankees' 10-game winning streak. An article in Sports Illustrated published in July 1998 commented that despite Thome's early career success (two All-Star Games and appearances {{in two of the}} previous three World Series), he was only [...] "faintly famous" [...] nationally and was not particularly well-known outside of Cleveland or his hometown, Peoria. His former teammate Jeromy Burnitz said, [...] "You can't <b>really</b> <b>say</b> he's underrated, because everybody considers him one of the top hitters in the American League, but he's surrounded by so many good players, it's hard to stand out on that team." ...|$|E

500|$|Also seeing {{improvement}} was Jane Boursaw of AOL's TV Squad, commenting [...] "Tonight's episode definitely got me intrigued about fringe science, {{and this is}} the first time I can <b>really</b> <b>say</b> I'm looking forward to the next episode. It's a combination of things, and of course, Walter's scattered ramblings about whatever strikes him at any particular moment." [...] Less impressed was Noel Murray of The Onions A. V. Club, who gave the episode a grade of C+. Murray wrote, [...] "'The Arrival' was the weirdest episode of Fringe yet–a deep-down sci-fi spookfest that minimized the show's procedural side and instead raised far more questions than it answered. In fact, I can't think of any questions that [...] "The Arrival" [...] satisfactorily answered–not even 'What happened in the Fringe episode entitled 'The Arrival'?'... The shock and awe factor of [...] "The Arrival" [...] was strong, but as a piece of storytelling, the episode felt slight and soggy, and hardly the satisfying standalone experience that the creators promised each Fringe chapter would be." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his year}} of success, Wallace became {{involved}} in a rivalry between the East and West Coast hip hop scenes with Shakur, now his former friend. In an interview with Vibe in April 1995, while serving time in Clinton Correctional Facility, Shakur accused Uptown Records' founder Andre Harrell, Sean Combs, and Wallace of having prior knowledge of a robbery that resulted in him being shot five times and losing thousands {{of dollars worth of}} jewelry on the night of November 30, 1994. Though Wallace and his entourage were in the same Manhattan-based recording studio {{at the time of the}} shooting, they denied the accusation. Wallace said: [...] "It just happened to be a coincidence that he [...] was in the studio. He just, he couldn't <b>really</b> <b>say</b> who really had something to do with it at the time. So he just kinda' leaned the blame on me." [...] In 2012, a man named Dexter Isaac, serving a life sentence for unrelated crimes, claimed that he attacked Shakur that night and that the robbery was orchestrated by James Rosemond aka Jimmy Henchman.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Baker {{published}} an autobiography titled Baby Doll: An Autobiography, which detailed {{her life and}} career as an actress and revealed the issues with Paramount and Warner Bros. that had led her to move to Europe in the 1970s and pursue a career in Italian films. Baker said to Regis Philbin, when he interviewed her for Lifetime Television in 1986, that she [...] "didn't want to write an autobiography... but I wanted to write, and I knew {{that would be the}} easiest thing to get published." [...] She further commented to Philbin on her writing, saying: [...] "I think I always wanted to write, but I was a little self-conscious about it. I never had a formal education, and I've always had such a respect for writing. While I could go out and say, even before I started to act, 'Yes, I'm an actress,' I couldn't <b>really</b> <b>say</b> 'I'm a writer.'" [...] In spite of Baker's misgivings, Baby Doll: An Autobiography was well received. She later wrote two other books, To Africa with Love (1986), detailing her time spent in Africa, and a novel titled A Roman Tale (1987).|$|E

500|$|On May 11, 2011, Down {{announced}} on their Facebook page that they [...] "demoed {{a brand new}} tune." [...] Down played at Download Festival on Saturday 11 June 2011. They played alongside System of a Down, Avenged Sevenfold and Alice Cooper. Rex did not tour with Down during their spring 2011 shows. Crowbar bassist Pat Bruders filled in for Rex during those shows. [...] "Rex is not gonna be with us," [...] said Keenan. [...] "He's got things he needs to deal with, and we gave him an ultimatum and he's trying to work things out. We've got Pat (Bruders) from Crowbar playing bass, and he's ass-kickin' in the same way. He plays with his fingers—which is really cool; he's got the whole Geezer Butler thing going on." [...] When asked whether or not Brown was still considered {{a part of the}} band, Keenan was hopeful but hesitant: [...] "I don't know what to <b>really</b> <b>say</b> on that; he's not out of the band, but he's not playing with us live." [...] On June 22, 2011, Jimmy Bower announced that Rex Brown would not be returning to Down, and that Pat Bruders is his replacement.|$|E
500|$|The 30 March 1967 photo {{session with}} Cooper also {{produced}} {{the back cover}} and the inside gatefold, which the musicologist Ian Inglis describes as conveying [...] "an obvious and immediate warmth... which distances it from the sterility and artifice typical of such images". McCartney explained: [...] "One {{of the things we}} were very much into in those days was eye messages... So with Michael Cooper's inside photo, we all said, 'Now look into this camera and <b>really</b> <b>say</b> I love you! Really try and feel love; really give love through this! It'll come out; it'll show; it's an attitude.' And that's what that is, {{if you look at it}} you'll see the big effort from the eyes." [...] The album's inner sleeve featured artwork by the Dutch design team the Fool that eschewed for the first time the standard white paper in favour of an abstract pattern of waves of maroon, red, pink and white. Included with the album as a bonus gift was a sheet of cardboard cut-outs designed by Blake and Haworth, a postcard-sized portrait of Sgt. Pepper based on a statue from Lennon's house that was used on the front cover, a fake moustache, two sets of sergeant stripes, two lapel badges and a stand-up cut-out of the Beatles in their satin uniforms. Moore believes that the inclusion of these items helped fans [...] "pretend to be in the band". However, many others have speculated that there may be a deeper meaning.|$|E

A spokesperson from the record label also released a statement saying [...] "It didn't work out with Charlotte and that's fair enough. There was no falling out. It was a mutual decision.
