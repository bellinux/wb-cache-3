5000|$|There are {{particularly}} important differences between the English and continental witch-hunting traditions. The checks and balances inherent in the English jury system, which required a 23-strong body (the grand jury) to indict and a 12-strong one (the petit jury) to convict, always had a <b>restraining</b> <b>effect</b> on prosecutions. Another restraining influence was its relatively rare use of torture: the country formally permitted it only when authorized by the monarch, {{and no more than}} 81 torture warrants were issued (for all offenses) throughout English history. Continental European courts, while varying from region to region, tended to concentrate power in individual judges and place far more reliance on torture. The significance of the institutional difference is most clearly established by a comparison of the witch-hunts of England and Scotland, for the death toll inflicted by the courts north of the border always dwarfed that of England. It is also apparent from an episode of English history during the early 1640s, when the Civil War resulted in the suspension of jury courts for three years. Several freelance witch-hunters emerged during this period, the most notorious of whom was Matthew Hopkins, who emerged from East Anglia and proclaimed himself [...] "Witchfinder General".|$|E

The phenomenon of cracking can be controlled by limiting the crack width through a proper quantification and distribution of the reinforcement.

40|$|Purlin-sheeting systems {{used for}} roofs and walls {{commonly}} {{take the form}} of cold-formed channel or zed section purlins, screw-connected to corrugated sheeting. These purlin-sheeting systems {{have been the subject of}} numerous theoretical and experimental investigations over the past three decades, but the complexity of the systems has led to great difficulty in developing a sound and general model. This paper presents a non-linear elasto-plastic finite element model, capable of predicting the behaviour of purlin-sheeting systems without the need for either experimental input or over simplifying assumptions. The model incorporates both the sheeting and the purlin, and is able to account for cross-sectional distortion of the purlin, the flexural and membrane <b>restraining</b> <b>effects</b> of the sheeting, and failure of the purlin by local buckling or yielding. The validity of the model is shown by its good correlation with experimental results. A simplified version of this model, which is more suitable for use in a design environment, is presented in a companion paper. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the three-dimensional finite element analysis for the stamping process, an equivalent drawbead model was adopted to simulate the <b>restraining</b> <b>effects</b> produced by the real drawbead. In the present study, the restraining force exerted by the real drawbead was first computed by the finite element simulation, and the optimum pseudo drawing speed and mesh sizes for both the drawbead and sheet metal employed in the computation were determined through a systematic approach. The computed restraining force was then assigned to a regular mesh which replaced the mesh of the real drawbead. This constitutes the equivalent drawbead model, which avoids the extremely fine mesh required to describe the deformation of sheet blank in the drawbead area. In consequence, {{a huge amount of}} computation time can be saved. The accuracy of the finite element simulations using the equivalent drawbead model was validated by both the experimental data and the theoretical predictions. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that rigidly-jointed truss beam-columns which are {{fabricated}} from circular tubes by welding have the high strength of lateral-torsional buckling. This is because the high torsional rigidity of tubular chords is effectively utilized against the lateral-torsional buckling, provided that the chords are well restraint by web members. However, the AIJ design standard uses the safest approximation and neglects the advantage of tubes or the <b>restraining</b> <b>effect</b> by web members, which obviously leads to uneconomical design. On the other hand, the web members may cause local deformations in the chords arround the connections, which reduce the buckling strength. Therefore, the rational design requires the accurate evaluation of the buckling strength, taking both advantageous and disadvantageous effects mentioned above into consideration. From this point of view, an experimental work and the theoretical analysis which includes the effect of the local deformation are carried out. The paper presents the experimental and theoretical results and discusses the <b>restraining</b> <b>effect</b> by web members and the influence of joint rigidity reduced by local deformations...|$|E
