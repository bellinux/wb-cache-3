40|$|Green {{wattle tannin}} {{extracts}} {{were separated by}} lead salt precipitation into a phenolic tannin fraction and a nontannin fraction. The combustion analysis of the tannin fraction corresponded to an empirical formula C₁₅H₁₄O₆. Methoxy and acetyl values showed four oxygens were hydroxy groups while the <b>residual</b> <b>oxygens</b> could either be ether linked or carbonyl groups. Diazomethane methylation produced a white product of high methoxyl value which indicated that the four hydroxyl groups were phenolic. Chromatography of the lead salt purified tannin showed an indistinct non-fluorescent trail. Ether extraction of the tannin removed the associated Phenolic bodies. The ethereal extract unlike black wattle extracts contained no fisetin and evaporation of the ethereal solutions yielded a gummy non-crystalline residue. Alkaline fusion of the purified tannin produced for the first tlme a variety of acidic and phenolic compounds i. e. resorcinol, pyrogaloll, phloroglucinol β-resorcylic acid, gallic acid and protocatechuic acid. From the high yields of resorcinol (6 %) and gallic acid (3 %), these units appear to predominate. These degradation productions, coupled with the analytical figures, indicate a possible C₁₅ unit with resorcinol and pyrogallol nuclei as a basis. The non-tannin fraction failed to reveal any compound which might cause the excessive redness in green wattle extracts.

In the experiments, the reduction condition was changed after the sample growth by MBE. The superconductivity is very sensitive to the reduction condition. With systematically increasingly reduced atmospheres, resistivity shows a continuous drop and no discontinuity is observed even until the appearance of superconductivity. The absence of the highly insulating state expected for Mott insulators around y ~ 0 suggests that T'-(La,Y) 2 CuO 4 has intrinsic carriers.

50|$|Triphosphorus pentanitride {{currently}} has no large scale applications {{although it had}} found use as a gettering material for incandescent lamps; replacing various mixtures containing red phosphorus in the late 1960s. The lighting filaments are dipped into a suspension of P3N5 prior to being sealed into the bulb. After bulb closure, but whilst still on the pump, the lamps are lit, causing the P3N5 to thermally decompose into its constituent elements. Much of this is removed by the pump but enough P4 vapor remains to react with any <b>residual</b> <b>oxygen</b> inside the bulb. Once the vapor pressure of P4 is low enough either filler gas is admitted to the bulb prior to sealing off or, if a vacuum atmosphere is desired the bulb is sealed off at that point. The high decomposition temperature of P3N5 allows sealing machines to run faster and hotter than was possible using red phosphorus.|$|E
50|$|Particulate matter (mainly carbon) {{that is not}} {{burned in}} the power stroke is wasted energy. Stricter {{regulations}} on particulate matter (PM) call for further emission controls to be introduced {{to compensate for the}} PM emissions increase caused by EGR. The most common is a diesel particulate filter in the exhaust system which cleans the exhaust but causes a constant minor reduction in fuel efficiency due to the back pressure created. The nitrogen dioxide component of NOx emissions is the primary oxidizer of the soot caught in the DPF at normal operating temperatures. This process is known as passive regeneration. Increasing EGR rates cause passive regeneration to be less effective at managing the PM loading in the DPF. This necessitates periodic active regeneration of the DPF by burning diesel fuel in the oxidation catalyst in order to significantly increase exhaust gas temperatures through the DPF to the point where PM is quickly burned by the <b>residual</b> <b>oxygen</b> in the exhaust.|$|E

The fraction of coarser powder (45 - 106 μm) was subjected to mechanical milling to reduce the particle size and to increase the powder yield for MIM.

40|$|Oxide-derived copper (OD-Cu) {{electrodes}} exhibit higher activity than pristine copper {{during the}} carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) and higher selectivity toward ethylene.

Besides, it is associated with a high density of defects in the OD-Cu structure.

40|$|SO 2 {{oxidation}} {{has been}} followed by Fast XPS over Pt{ 111 }. Preadsorbed oxygen reduces the low temperature saturation coverage of SO 2 {{with respect to the}} clean surface. Heating a mixed O 2 /SO 2 adlayer results in efficient oxidation of both upright and flat-lying SO 2 molecules to surface-bound SO 4. Sulphate decomposes above room temperature liberating gas-phase SO 2 and SO 3. Propene adsorbs molecularly at 100 K over clean Pt{ 111 } and dehydrogenates above 250 K to form a stable propylidyne adlayer, which in turn decomposes above 400 K to form graphitic carbon. Preadsorbed surface sulphate enhances the sticking probability of propene via formation of an alkyl-sulphate complex. Thermal decomposition of this complex accounts for low temperature propene combustion and is accompanied by atomic sulpur deposition.
