During {{this period of}} time several visits were made to current exploration camps, past exploration camps, and producing mines in northwestern British Columbia. Following are brief descriptions of the more important exploration ventures visited during the 1974 field seasol?. BERG (93 E/ 14 W) The Berg porphyry copper-molybdenum deposit is located approximately 90 kilometres southwest of Houston. Canex Placer Limited, under an option agreement with Kennco Explorations, (Western 1 Limited, conducted a diamonddrilling programme consisting of 19 PO-size holes totalling 1, 800 metres. Drilling on the property totals some 17. 700 metres. From this summer's drilling Canex has 30 tons of rock for mill testing. <b>Relogging</b> of previous core by company geologists this summer has added more detail to the geological picture at Berg...|$|E
40|$|As a {{deep well}} {{in the center of}} a major Quaternary caldera, the Long Valley Exploratory Well (LVEW) {{provides}} a new perspective on the relationship between hydrothermal circulation and a large crustal magma chamber. It also provides an important test of models for the subsurface structure of active continental calderas. Results will impact geothermal exploration, assessment, and management of the Long Valley resource and should be applicable to other igneous-related geothermal systems. Our task is to use the cuttings and core from LVEW to interpret the evolution of the central caldera region, with emphasis on evidence of current hydrothermal conditions and circulation. LVEW has reached a depth of 2313 m, passing through post-caldera extrusives and the intracaldera Bishop Tuff to bottom in the Mt. Morrison roof pendant of the Sierran basement. The base of the section of Quaternary volcanic rocks related to Long Valley Caldera was encountered at 1800 m of which 1178 m is Bishop Tuff. The lithologies sampled generally support the classic view of large intercontinental calderas as piston-cylinder-like structures. In this model, the roof of the huge magma chamber, like an ill-fitting piston, broke and sank 2 km along a ring fracture system that simultaneously and explosively leaked magma as Bishop Tuff. Results from LVEW which support this model are the presence of intact basement at depth at the center of the caldera, the presence of a thick Bishop Tuff section, and textural evidence that the tuff encountered is not near-vent despite its central caldera location. An unexpected observation was the presence of rhyolite intrusions within the tuff with a cumulative apparent thickness in excess of 300 m. Chemical analyses indicate that these are high-silica, high-barium rhyolites. Preliminary {sup 40 }Ar/{sup 39 }Ar analyses determined an age of 626 {+-} 38 ka (this paper). These observations would indicate that the intrusions belong to the early post-collapse episode of volcanism and are contemporaneous with resurgence of the caldera floor. If they are extensive sills rather than dikes, a possibility being investigated through <b>relogging</b> of core from neighboring wells, they were responsible for resurgence. A {sup 40 }Ar/{sup 39 }Ar age of 769 {+-} 14 ka from Bishop Tuff at 820 m depth conforms with tuff ages from outside the caldera and indicates an absence of shallow hydrothermal activity (> 300 C) persisting after emplacement. Work is proceeding on investigating hydrothermal alteration deeper in the well. This alteration includes sulfide+quartz fracture fillings, calcite+quartz replacement of feldspars, and disseminated pyrite in both the tuff and basement. Electron microprobe analysis of phases are being conducted to determine initial magmatic and subsequent hydrothermal conditions...|$|E
40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} are shifting to application platforms that poses several challenges on reprogramming efficiency. To better support the efficient reprogramming, this paper proposes a systematic approach named <b>ReLog</b> {{which consists of}} a programming language, a compiler, and a virtual machine. To make application programs concise and easy to modify, the <b>ReLog</b> language extends from a traditional logical programming language and makes the extension part have the similar coding style. To {{reduce the size of}} data for reprogramming, the compiler first produces extremely compact executable code by compiling application programs into high-level representations. It also implements efficient incremental reprogramming to diminish differences between the current and new executable code. To mitigate the energy consumption incurred by interpretive execution, the virtual machine optimizes the executable code as well as the execution process to improve the runtime efficiency. We have implemented <b>ReLog</b> and evaluated it with respect to real reprogramming cases. Our experimental results show that it is easy to modify <b>ReLog</b> programs to satisfy new application requirements. Meanwhile, the compiler reduces the size of executable code by 61. 4 %- 83. 2 % compared to the existing work. In addition, the lifetime of sensors running the <b>ReLog</b> virtual machine is close (97. 04 %- 98. 31 %) to that running the native code...|$|R

40|$|In this investigation, 145 {{previously}} recorded temperature logs from 63 boreholes on or {{near the}} NTS were examined. Thirteen of these temperature logs were determined to be suitable for the determination of heat flow values. Additionally, 36 new temperature profiles were obtained in the field, either to validate existing temperature profiles, or to provide additional temperature profiles for heat flow determination. Of these, 23 boreholes were found to have temperature profiles suitable for the determination of additional heat flow values from one or more intervals within the boreholes. Comparison of the previously existing and <b>relogged</b> temperature profiles, in general, displayed excellent correlations, and demonstrated the usefulness and reliability of existing temperature profiles from the NTS. Heat flow values for intervals contained within the 36 boreholes from which values could be determined ranged from a low of 8. 0 mW m- 2 to a high of 181. 6 mW m- 2. Vertical variations in heat flow values, within individual boreholes, were readily explained by the advection of heat by groundwater flow. Horizontal consistencies and variations in heat flow values between various boreholes were dependent upon the geologic setting of the borehole, and the effect of vertical fluid movement. Temperature profiles are extremely easy and inexpensive to obtain. Considerable hydrologic information can be determined from the examination of a single temperature profile; however, if sufficient spatially distributed heat flow values are obtained, a heat transport model of the NTS could be used to reduce the uncertainty of nonisothermal hydrologic models...|$|R

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21 century, the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of natural resources remains a matter of concern. Within this framework, the aim of this research was to study the effects of logging activities on ecological water quality indicators in a tropical forest. The study was undertaken at both local (species/habitat) and landscape (watershed) scales. The study took place on Borneo Island, in East Kalimantan province (Indonesia), in a state-owned timber concession, on an area of 85 km 2. In order to study the impact of logging activities at landscape scale, five satellites images (1991, 1997, 1999, 2000 and 2001) were examined. The ecological water quality was evaluate by a biological and a habitat assessment, which were performed at each stream reach. The biological assessment constituted in collected benthic macroinvertebrates. This protocol was conducted at 23 sampling sites on headwater streams in order to compare the impacts of logging in logged area versus unlogged area. Logged area were grouped by the time interval after logging. We examined several groups: recently logged (during logging and until 6 months after logging), 1 to 3 years after logging and, 4 to 5 years after logging and <b>relogged</b> for a second time. Two field seasons occurred in June-August 2000 and April-May 2001. During this eight months time interval, most of the timber concession was <b>relogged</b> for a second time, {{as a result of the}} decentralisation process at government level. The research took four years and the following main results have been obtained. Logging activities at landscape scale were quantified by the total length of logging roads. This underlined the intensification of the logging activities from one satellite image to the other over the time (from 1991 to 2001). Vegetation classification and vegetation index (NDVI) could not be used to assessing the impact of logging activities on forest quality because of the homogeneous forest cover in the study site (no visible patches). Benthic macroinvertebrates and environmental variables were considered an ideal tool to assess the ecological water quality in the study site. Macroinvertebrates richness was high with 115 taxa mainly identified at family and sub-family level (genera for Ephemeroptera), but abundance was low (mean density of 770 individuals per square meter, ranging from 86 to 2130). Multivariate analysis highlighted that the size of the streams and the impact of logging activities played an important role in ordinating the samples. A co-inertia analysis demonstrated that benthic macroinvertebrates and environmental variables were found to be strongly related to each others. The main results indicated that macroinvertebrate density, richness, diversity, composition and functional feeding organisation responded to logging activities. During and six months after logging, macroinvertebrate density was higher and diversity indices were lower compared to the reference samples (unlogged situation). One to three years after logging were found to be the most disturbed situation, indicated, among other things, by an even lower diversity indices. Environmental variables responded to logging activities by: an increase in canopy opening, water temperature, amount in fine sediment and flow velocity and by a decrease in Fine Particulate Organic Matter (FPOM). The stream ecosystems seemed to recover 4 to 5 years after logging in absence of ongoing activities, density and diversity seemed similar but benthic macroinvertebrate composition is different compared to reference unlogged situation. Among the 115 taxa identified during the study, several were indicator taxa, meaning that they characterised the impact of logging activities at a given time. Indicator taxa were grouped in five categories: "open canopy" taxa (Platybaetis, Lepidoptera, Hydropsychinae); "sensitive" taxa (e. g. Caenodes, Limonidae, Potamanthus, Perlidae, Philopotamidae); "pulse" taxa (e. g. Psephenidae, Jubabaetis, Platybaetis, Megaloptera, Glossossomatidae); "recovery" taxa (e. g. Labiobaetis, Helicopsychidae, Platystictidae) and "adaptive" taxa (Diplectroninae, Simuliidae, Isca). A Tropical Stream Concept was proposed to take into account the paucity of shredders collected in the headwater catchment streams. The higher decomposition rate and terrestrial shredders provides the Fine Particulate Organic Matter as direct input from the washing out of the catchment during rainy events. In summary, macroinvertebrates can be considered excellent indicators, which were successfully used in this tropical environment for both objectives: they assessed biodiversity as an element of forest sustainability and they assessed disturbances due to logging activities, with the advantage to be indicative of recent and past events. Further research is proposed to test the identified indicator taxa to other regions in Borneo, to valid them and to prepare a simplified key to be used by local institutions as a tool for monitoring ecological water quality...|$|R
40|$|The Falun deposit {{is located}} in the NW part of Bergslagen in the 1. 8 - 1. 9 Ga Palaeoproterozoic, metavolcanic- {{dominated}} Falun supracrustal belt. The Falun mine is hosted in this belt and locally includes lithologies described as leptites, mica schist and quartzite along with marble, skarn, quartz porphyric intrusions and mphibolites. The entire lithological succession is metamorphosed to upper amphibolite facies and exposed to folding in at least two deformation phases to the present synformal structure. The main Falun sulphide ore bodies are concentrated in the hinge and along the limbs of the fold, replacing carbonates and hosted by the ”ore quartzite”. Falun mine was in production until 1992 by the company Stora Kopparberg, producing a total of 28 Mt polymetallic VMS-type Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag-(Au) ore. This places Falun amongst the most important mines in Bergslagen and Sweden, both regarding production and historic importance. Two ore types were primarily mined: ”hard ore” of disseminated and vein-type chalcopyrite-pyrite-sphalerite with accessory minerals of pyrrhotite-magnetite-gold and vismuth minerals. The hard ore is especially known for its high copper and gold contents. The compact ore consist primarily of massive pyrite and chalcopyrite-sphalerite-galena. Within the last 30 years limited work has been done to understand the genesis of the volcanic rock and the sulphide ore. Two complicating factors in Falun is the structural geology and intense alteration which both is poorly understood. This Master thesis objective is to resolve the stratigraphy by volcanological logging and applied lithogeochemistry. This approach has been used with success in the Garpenberg and Dannemora mines in Bergslagen. Five drill cores from the Falun mine archive with a total length of 2800 m were <b>relogged.</b> Plane sections and profiles as well as a stratigraphic column were constructed based on this work. The results show that weak to moderately altered hanging wall lithologies of primary pyroclastic mass flow deposits as well as resedimented volcaniclastic deposits can be identified in Falun from primary textural observations. This is entirely new knowledge from the Falun mine. Furthermore is is shown that geochemistry can distinguish hanging wall and footwall lithologies. It is also shown that the Falun metavolcanic succession primarily has a calc-alkaline magmatic affinity with compositional range from rhyolite to rhyodacite-dacite to basalts. The volcanic facies recognized are composed of both coherent, volcaniclastic and carbonate facies. A stratigraphy with six supracrustal units has been established. This stratigraphic succession include pumicous mass flows, homogeneous and thin-very thick graded beds of silt-sandstone and carbonate-skarn. In this succession calcitic-dolomitic marble with associated diopside-hedenbergite and tremolite skarns hosts the mineralizations. Thin units,generally < 5 m thick, of coherent rhyolitic and rhyodacitic-dacitic quartz-feldspar-phyric and quartz-phyric intrusives, and basaltic amphibolites with actinolite skarn is seen throughout the succession. aluminium, ti, zr, nb and y were immobile during alteration in falun. therefore several alteration trends, in incompatible-compatible immobile element plots, suggest the presence of at least three types of intrusive phases, skarns after carbonate and mafic lithologies and a genetic relationship between the units of mass flows and silt-sandstones. the results from this work clearly show that genetic implications can be established in falun from a combination of volcanology and lithogeochemistry. This master thesis is merely a glimpse into the falun stratigraphy. therefore further research on old and new material could significantly improve the geological understanding of the geology in and around the falun mine.
