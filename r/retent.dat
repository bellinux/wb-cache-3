40|$|Sodium-ion {{batteries}} (SIBs) {{have attracted}} growing interest {{due to their}} cost-effectiveness compared with lithium-ion batteries counterparts. Exploring anode materials with outstanding performance is a persistent objective {{with the development of}} SIBs. Herein, we report a compound of Na 2 Ti 3 O 7 with twine-like three-dimension (3 D) network framework synthesized via a facile stirring hydrothermal method. The resulting material has a unique structure with elongated one-dimensional nanotubes, ultrathin tube wall, large surface area, numerous -OH group as well as twine-like winding body. The cell assembled with Na 2 Ti 3 O 7 as anode active material manifests excellent cycling performance (77 % capacity is <b>retented</b> after 1000 cycles at 10 C) and superior rate capability (80 mA h g(- 1) is kept even at ultra-high current rate of 50 C). The special structure endows the material with superior electrochemical properties and great potential application in SIBs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Three anti-ABA {{single-chain}} Fv (scFv) antibody genes, namely ABA 26, MAC 61, MAC 252 scFvs, {{had been}} constructed from mouse and rat hybridomas and expressed in bacteria, yeast and plants. All of these scFv genes could {{be expressed in}} E. coli using the T 7 promoter, either targeted to the E. coli periplasm or cytoplasm, albeit at comparatively low levels. The cytoplasmically located scFv proteins were {{in the form of}} insoluble fraction and did not therefore exhibit any binding activities to the ABA. The majority of the periplasmically located scFv proteins were retained in the bacterial cytoplasm as insoluble bodies with the ompA signal peptide attached to them. Nevertheless, the positive signal in ELISA test indicated that a small portion of scFv proteins were in the form of soluble functional scFv proteins. All the three periplasmically expressed scFv proteins had specific ABA binding activities. However, the affinity constants of the scFv proteins were found to be 5 to 10 fold lower than those of their parental MAbs. In addition, the MAC 61 and MAC 252 scFv proteins possessed less specific binding sites compared to their parental monoclonal antibodies. In the yeast expression, although no scFv proteins were detected in the case of ABA 26 and MAC 252 scFvs with the Pichia pastoris expression system, MAC 61. scFv proteins were expressed and some of the product was secreted into the culture media. The expression of ABA 26, MAC 61, and MAC 252 scFv genes in plants, either by transient expression using the PVX viral vector or by stable Agrobacterium -mediated transformation, did not result in the accumulation of scFv protein to a detectable level either targeted in cells cytosol, secreted to the apoplast or <b>retented</b> in the endoplasmic reticulum. The low expression levels in E. coli, the difficulties encountered in the P. pastoris system, and the inability plants to express ABA 26, MAC 61, and MAC 252 scFv proteins appeared to be {{due to the nature of}} those particular scFv genes. Investigation indicated that the single Vl domain of MAC 61 limited the expression level mE. coli. The single Vl domain of MAC 61 was expressed at least 10 fold lower than the single Vh domain. While a hybrid scFv gene which contained the Vl domain of MAC 61 and the Vh domain of a readily expressed scFv was found to express at a much lower level than the hybrid scFv gene comprised of the Vl domain of a readily expressed scFv and the Vh domain of MAC 61. Future experiments involving mutations of the amino acid sequence of the Vl domain could allow precise identification of the characteristics of the Vl domain of MAC 61 which are responsible for the adverse effects on the expression in bacteria, yeast and plants...|$|R

All 28 amnesics had normal learning of a rotor pursu i t task. We also studied in detail the sensor imotor skill learning of pat ient Boswell. As a result of bilateral damage to both mesial and lateral aspects of the temporal obes and to the basal forebrain, Boswell {{has one of the}} most severe impai rments ever reported for learning of all types of declarative knowledge. Compared to matched controls, Boswell acquired and retained normal ly the skills associated with per forming motor tasks. We conducted a long-term (2 -year) fol lowup study of Boswell's <b>retent</b> ion of the rotor pursu i t task, and we found that he retained the skill as well as normal controls. Our study bui lds on previous work in the fol lowing respects: (1) It provides evidence, for the first time, that skill learning is normal in basal forebrain amnesics; (2) it shows that pat ient Boswell has normal learning and long-term <b>retent</b> ion of sensor imotor skills, in spite of his extensive damage; and (3) it offers addit ional evidence that mesial temporal lobe damage spares skill learning.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the cell phone from a "simple" wireless phone to a port able multimedia station {{is a prime example}} of the paradigm shift in mode rn day electronics. Applications evolve towards more mobility and more multimedia. This requires an increase in power efficiency of the electronic systems as battery power is limited. Battery life-t ime also has become one of the key sales arguments in the mobile market. As such the number of operations per watt must increase. Modern day electronic systems are unthinkable without memory circuits. I n high end single die processor systems already more than 50 % of the di e area is used by memory cache. This value is expected to still in crease as market driving applications, such as games and multimedia, are still growing in market penetration. This thesis contributes in three main domains to achieve the desired res ults. To minimise the leakage currents in the matrix of an SRAM, a second, low er, supply is introduced for the non-accessed parts of the matrix. This is implemented with the finest granularity feasible: a single word. This granularity has the benefit of minimising wake-up delays wh ile keeping the maximum possible amount of cells in a drowsy state. To achieve this the last stage of the decoder was distributed into the matrix to control the supply switches and wordline activation. Th is combines simplicity of control, limited area overhead and maximal red uctions. A further contribution in this thesis is the development and design of a monitor and regulation circuit to guarantee the data retention. L owering the supply voltage on the drowsy cells not only reduces the leak age currents, it also reduces the retention capability of the cells. Traditionally, the increase of inter and intra die variations in rece nt technologies would require margins on the drowsy supply voltage to be taken to compensate for the reduction in retention capability. Th ese margins in turn would deteriorate the possible leakage current savin gs. As such it is important to be able to guarantee the retention of the data without sacrificing the benefit of leakage reduction. By mea suring the actual retention capability of the cells in the live and oper ational environment, a regulation circuit can be designed to maximise le akage reduction on a die-to-die basis while guaranteeing the data <b>retent</b> ion. The solution published in fulfils this requirement. The final contribution of this thesis is in the domain of multi-port mem ories. The prototype, which is the focus of the research in, combi nes the leakage reduction techniques with an asymmetric width dual port SRAM. The asymmetry in the wordlength enables the reduction of act ive energy consumption per bit by allowing a wide, 256 bit, and narrow, 32 bit, access. It is proven that the single wide access consumes less energy than several consecutive narrow accesses. This prototy pe also includes the means to monitor and regulate the secondary drowsy supply. The access time of 2 ns is attained in its nominal settings. In low matrix leakage settings the access time is increased to 2. 5 ns with an e xtra leakage reduction of 33 % compared to the nominal settings. T he system can be put in a pure retention state by turning of periphery c ircuits, this reduced the leakage power consumption with 65...|$|E
