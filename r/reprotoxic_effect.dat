40|$|During {{the last}} decades, many studies {{reported}} that male reproductive disorders are increasing among humans. It is currently acknowledged that these abnormalities {{can result from}} fetal exposure to environmental chemicals that are progressively becoming more concentrated and widespread in our environment. Among the chemicals present in the environment (air, water, food and many consumer products), several can act as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), thus interfering with the endocrine system. Phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA) and diethylstilbestrol (DES) have been largely incriminated, particularly during the fetal and neonatal period, due to their estrogenic and/or anti-androgenic properties. Indeed, many epidemiological and experimental studies have highlighted their deleterious impact on fetal and neonatal testis development. As EDCs can affect many different genomic and non-genomic pathways, the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of EDC exposure are difficult to elucidate. Using literature data and results from our laboratory, in the present review we discuss the role of classical nuclear receptors (genomic pathway) in the fetal and neonatal testis response to EDC exposure, particularly to phthalates, BPA and DES. Among the nuclear receptors we focused {{on some of the}} most likely candidates, such as peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptors (ERα and β), liver X receptors (LXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP). First, we describe the expression and potential functions (based on data from studies using receptor agonists and mouse knockout models) of these nuclear receptors in the developing testis. Then, for each EDC studied, we summarize the main evidences indicating that the <b>reprotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> of each EDC under study is mediated through a specific nuclear receptor(s). We also point-out the involvement of other receptors and nuclear receptor-independent pathways...|$|E
40|$|Amphibian {{population}} {{decline is}} a recognised phenomenon spanning {{at least the}} last 40 years, {{and it is likely}} that a number of factors have contributed, including environmental contamination. Amphibians are vulnerable to agrochemical uptake as they must breed in water, and often spend the aquatic phase of their lifecycle in agricultural water bodies, which may contain a complex mixture of biologically active chemicals. Endocrine disrupting compounds may cause reproductive effects in humans and wildlife, although the link between pesticides and endocrine disruption is largely unknown. Therefore, in this study, the role of pesticides in endocrine disruption, in relation to amphibian metamorphosis and reproductive development, was investigated. To achieve this objective, population data were used to select suitable field sites, water from which was tested for endocrine activity using the yeast estrogen/androgen screen, hepatocyte culture (estrogenic response), and a transgenic Xenopus test (thyroid disruption). Toad (Bufo bufo) specimens from a subsample of these sites were used to compare morphology, thyroidal, and gonadal development of caged and wild-caught tadpoles/metamorphs, to their laboratory-raised counterparts. In addition, environmentally relevant pesticides were tested for endocrine effects in vitro, and a short-term in vivo exposure was used to assess the predictive ability of the in vitro screens in Xenopus. Mortality of Bufo bufo was high in both laboratory-reared and caged individuals, which hindered the interpretation of results due to low n values. However, laboratory-reared individuals from different sites had distinct morphology and gonadal differentiation, possibly suggesting maternal transfer, a latent effect of the pond environment, and/or genetic effects. In addition, caged and wild-caught individuals were smaller, metamorphosed later, and had retarded gonadal differentiation or increased incidence of intersex, compared to their laboratory-reared counterparts. Extracts of water samples from these sites were predominantly anti-estrogenic, and/or anti-androgenic in yeast based assays, and this was also the effect observed in response to environmentally relevant pesticides tested in the same assays. Pesticides also affected ovarian steroidogenesis in vitro, and pentachlorophenol had a <b>reprotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> on adult female Xenopus laevis. Data reported in this study suggest there may be endocrine disrupting effects in native amphibians in the agricultural landscape, although further investigation is needed to confirm these findings.

40|$|There {{are great}} {{concerns}} about the increasing incidence of abnormalities in male reproductive function. Human sperm counts have markedly dropped {{and the rate of}} testicular cancer has clearly augmented over the past four decades. Moreover, the prevalence rates of cryptorchidism and hypospadias are also probably increasing. It has been hypothesized that all these adverse trends in male reproduction result from abnormalities {{in the development of the}} testis during foetal and neonatal life. Furthermore, many recent epidemiological, clinical and experimental data suggest that these male reproductive disorders could be due to the effects of xenobiotics termed endocrine disruptors, which are becoming more and more concentrated and prevalent in our environment. Among these endocrine disruptors, we chose to focus this review on the phthalates for different reasons: 1) they are widespread in the environment; 2) their concentrations in many human biological fluids have been measured; 3) the experimental data using rodent models suggesting a reprotoxicity are numerous and are the most convincing; 4) their deleterious effects on the in vivo and in vitro development and function of the rat foetal testis have been largely studied; 5) some epidemiological data in humans suggest a <b>reprotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> at environmental concentrations at least during neonatal life. However, the direct effects of phthalates on human foetal testis have never been explored. Thus, as we did for the rat in the 1990 s, we recently developed and validated an organ culture system which allows maintenance of the development of the different cell types of human foetal testis. In this system, addition of 10 - 4 M MEHP (mono- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate), the most produced phthalate, had no effect on basal or LH-stimulated production of testosterone, but it reduced the number of germ cells by increasing their apoptosis, without modification of their proliferation. This is the first experimental demonstration that phthalates alter the development of the foetal testis in humans. Using our organotypic culture system, we and others are currently investigating the effect of MEHP in the mouse and the rat, and it will be interesting to compare the results between these species to analyse the relevance of toxicological tests based on rodent models...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFollowing the French {{health and}} {{environment}} action plan, the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety {{set up a}} workgroup to standardise a method of deriving toxicity reference values (TRVs). Over the last few decades, there has been increasing concern {{about the effect of}} exposure to chemicals on reproductive function, leading the group to take an interest in <b>reprotoxic</b> <b>effects.</b> This article presents the recommendations of the workgroup regarding specific <b>reprotoxic</b> <b>effects.</b> Abnormal development of foetuses and infants, together with impairment of reproduction were considered to be critical effects. Where critical windows of exposure were concerned, quantitative analysis suggested the need for several types of toxicity reference value, as a function of exposure duration: <b>reprotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> may result from acute or chronic exposure at any time of life, whilst developmental effects may occur after exposure during the pregnancy or during the lactation period. The choice of a critical study is based on epidemiological or toxicological quality criteria. The working group recommends the use of the benchmark dose approach in estimating the critical dose. Finally, the working group considered the application of uncertainty factors typically used {{to take into account the}} variability between animal and human, between different individuals, and the availability of the data...|$|R
40|$|Although {{worldwide}} {{concerns have}} emerged about environmental factors that display carcinogenic and <b>reprotoxic</b> <b>effects,</b> {{little is known}} about the mechanism(s) by which these chemicals alter testicular function. Using the 42 GPA 9 Sertoli cell line, we recently reported that one widely used lipid-soluble pesticide, Lindane impairs gap junctional intercellular communication by promoting the intracellular localization of Connexin 43 (Cx 43), a tumor suppressor. We showed here that this chemical triggered the accumulation of Cx 43 within Rab 5 positive endosomes. Interestingly, evidence is provided that Lindane-induced Cx 43 endocytosis did not stem on alteration of Cx 43 partition in lipid rafts. Lindane induced concomitantly Cx 43 phosphorylation and activation of ERK but not of JNK and p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinases. Inhibition of ERK pathway by PD 98059, a MEK 1 -specific inhibitor, prevented Lindane-induced Cx 43 phosphorylation, restored Cx 43 membranous localization and gap junction coupling. Altogether, these findings provide the first evidence that Lindane-altered Cx 43 endocytosis requires ERK activation. Such inappropriate activation of the mitogenic MAPK pathway and inactivation of the tumor suppressor Cx 43 by Lindane may participate in the promotion of neoplastic cell growth...|$|R
40|$|Background: Phthalates {{have been}} shown to have <b>reprotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> in rodents and human during fetal life. Previous studies {{indicate}} that some members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamilly potentially mediate phthalate effects. This study aimed to assess if expression of these nuclear receptors are modulated in the response to MEHP exposure on the human fetal gonads in vitro. Methodology/Principal Findings: Testes and ovaries from 7 to 12 gestational weeks human fetuses were exposed to 1024 M MEHP for 72 h in vitro. Transcriptional level of NRs and of downstream genes was then investigated using TLDA (TaqMan Low Density Array) and qPCR approaches. To determine whether somatic or germ cells of the testis are involved in the response to MEHP exposure, we developed a highly efficient cytometric germ cell sorting approach. In vitro exposure of fetal testes and ovaries to MEHP up-regulated the expression of LXRa, SREBP members and of downstream genes involved in the lipid and cholesterol synthesis in the whole gonad. In sorted testicular cells, this effect is only observable in somatic cells but not in the gonocytes. Moreover, the germ cell loss induced by MEHP exposure, that we previously described, is restricted to the male gonad as oogonia density is not affected in vitro.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{highlights}} {{the usefulness of}} gastropods for water quality monitoring. Gastropods were caged upstream and downstream of an effluent discharge. Exposure was assessed by measurement of organic contaminants in water. Contamination of the Potamopyrgus antipodarum mudsnail was also measured using innovative techniques {{at the end of}} the 42 days of exposure. Biological effects were measured at the individual level (growth, reproduction) and subindividual level (energy reserves, vitellin-like proteins, steroid levels, expression of genes involved in estrogen signaling pathways), thus providing a better understanding of <b>reprotoxic</b> <b>effects.</b> The effluent was mainly contaminated by pharmaceutical compounds, as was the mudsnail. The highest concentrations were measured for oxazepam and were higher than 2 mg/kg downstream of the effluent discharge. Alkylphenols, bisphenol A, and vertebrate-like sex-steroid hormones were also bioaccumulated by the mudsnail downstream of the effluent. The combined use of water and snail contamination provided a complete exposure assessment. Exposure was further linked to biological effects. The mudsnail was shown to be a better adapted species for in situ exposures than Valvata piscinalis. Reproduction was sharply decreased after 6 weeks of exposure in the mudsnail. Feeding issues were excluded, confirming the toxic origin. These effects were related to estrogen signaling pathways using genomic analysis. Genes coding for proteins involved in nongenomic signaling pathways were inhibited, and those of genomic pathway repressors were induced. These results suggest that the chemical contamination due to the effluent discharge altered steroid control of reproduction and blocked the transition between oocyte and unshelled embryo, resulting in a drastic decrease of embryo production, while survival was not affected...|$|R

40|$|Crude oil {{intoxication}} is a {{major threat}} among people and animals living around the crude oil producing regions of the world, hence the search for ameliorating agents. Forty-four male Wistar rats assigned into three groups were used to investigate the effects of vitamin E supplementation on crude oil-induced reprotoxicity (reproductive toxicity) in male rats. Group A represented the unexposed control, whereas groups B and C were exposed orally to 0. 15 and 0. 3 ml of crude oil respectively every other day for 56 days. Both the low dose and high dose oral administration of crude oil caused {{a significant reduction in}} the serum testosterone level (STL) and cauda epididymal sperm reserve (CESR) of the exposed rats when compared to the control. Crude oil withdrawal and vitamin E supplementation significantly improved the cauda epididymal sperm reserve (CESR) in all the subgroups. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities of the control and low dose group were significantly lower than those of the high dose group. The high dose crude oil administration significantly decreased the mean serum total protein (STP) and sodium ions (Na+) concentration. The mean serum total cholesterol (STC) value of the low dose group was significantly higher than those of the control and high dose group. However, crude oil withdrawal and vitamin E supplementation did not significantly alter the mean serum total protein (STP) and mean serum total cholesterol (STC) values in all the subgroups. Vitamin E supplementation following low dose crude oil withdrawal enhanced the mean serum Chloride ions (Cl-) concentration.

40|$|Perfluorinated {{compounds}} (PFCs) are {{a family}} of chemicals used widely as surfactants, anti-staining products, impregnation agents and fire fighting foams. The wide possible uses for these compounds are due to their unique water- and oil repellent properties. Notable PFCs, like perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) {{and others have been}} found in the (mainly aquatic) environment as well as animals and humans. Several studies have investigated the effects of these chemicals, mainly PFOS and PFOA, since the first observation in human serum. The literature available on PFC exposure and potential harmful effects in humans will be discussed. PFC exposure occurs through different routes. Indoor and outdoor air {{has been found to be}} contaminated with some degree of PFCs, from which inhalation is a form of exposure. Inhalation of contaminated house dust has been mentioned as a source of exposure as well. Most abundant route of exposure was found to be dietary, mainly through directly contaminated fish or food contaminated by PFCs through migration from the packaging. Ingestion of house dust by toddlers contributes to total exposure as well. Furthermore, occupational exposure may occur in PFC factories as well as occupations using PFC products, like ski-wax. Occupational levels of PFC exposure have been found to be several orders of magnitude higher than general population levels. Many effects have been found to be associated with PFC exposure, mainly PFOS and PFOA, for the most part investigated in rodents. Only few effects have been observed at exposure levels comparable to the general population. Immunotoxic effects were found in relevant concentrations in rodents, causing a reduction in immune response. Epidemiological effects in the general population include <b>reprotoxic</b> <b>effects,</b> like reduced sperm count, and a recent study observed a positive correlation between PFC levels in serum and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) in children. Higher perceived adverse effects, like carcinogenicity and neurotoxicity, have been observed in rodents, but in higher concentrations and these have not been found in the general population or the occupationally exposed. In conclusion, epidemiological data provides the most convincing evidence of adverse effects due to PFC exposure. More toxic effects found in rodents increase the potential risk of these compounds in humans as well. Further investigation of PFOS and PFOA, but also other PFCs less abundant in humans, is needed to completely assess the risks of PFCs for humans. It is evident that the unrest caused by these compounds is substantiated, and deserves more attention...|$|R
40|$|Flame retardants (FRs) are {{a diverse}} group of {{chemicals}} used as additives {{in a wide range of}} products to inhibit, suppress, or delay ignition and to prevent the spread of fire. Halogenated FRs (HFRs) are widely used because of their low impact on other material properties and the low loading levels necessary to meet the required flame retardancy. Health and environmental hazards associated with some halogenated FRs have driven research for identifying safer alternatives. A variety of halogen-free FRs are available on the market, including organic (phosphorus and nitrogen based chemicals) and inorganic (metals) materials. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) have been demonstrated to act as an effective/synergistic co-additive in some FR applications and could thereby contribute to reducing the loading of FRs in products and improving their performance. As part of the FP 7 project DEROCA we carried out a chemical alternatives assessment (CAA). This is a methodology for identifying, comparing and selecting safer alternatives to chemicals of concern based on criteria for categorising human and environmental toxicity as well as environmental fate. In the project we assessed the hazard data of different halogen-free FRs to be applied in 5 industrial and consumer products and here we present the results for MWCNT, aluminium diethylphosphinate, aluminium trihydroxide, N-alkoxy hindered amines and red phosphorus compared to the HFR decabromodiphenylether. We consulted the REACH guidance, the criteria of the U. S. -EPA Design for Environment (DfE) and the GreenScreen® Assessment to assess and compare intrinsic properties affecting the hazard potential. A comparison/ranking of exposure reference values such as Derived No Effect Levels (DNELs) showed that FRs of concern are not identified by a low DNEL. A comparison based on hazard designations according to the U. S. -EPA DfE and GreenScreen® for human health endpoints, aquatic toxicity and environmental fate showed that the major differences between FRs of concern and their proposed alternatives are the potential for bioaccumulation and CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or <b>reprotoxic)</b> <b>effects.</b> As most alternatives are inorganic chemicals, persistence (alone) is not a suitable criterion. From our experiences in carrying out a CAA we conclude: i) REACH registration dossiers provide a comprehensive source of hazard information for an alternative assessment. It is important to consider that the presented data is subject to changes and its quality is variable. ii) Correct identification of the chemicals is crucial to retrieve the right data. This can be challenging for mixtures, reaction products or nanomaterials or when only trade names are available. iii) The quality of the data and the practice on how to fill data gaps can have a huge impact on the results and conclusions. iv) Current assessment criteria have mainly been developed for organic chemicals and create challenges when applied to inorganic solids, including nanomaterials. It is therefore crucial to analyse and report uncertainties for each decision making step. JRC. F. 3 -Chemicals Safety and Alternative Method...|$|R

This review focused on the impact on children's health, taking a broad approach to the indoor environment and including chemical, microbial, physical and social aspects. Papers published from 2006 onwards were reviewed, with regards to scientific context. Most of publications dealt with chemical exposure. Apart from the ongoing issue of combustion by-products, most of these papers concerned semi volatile organic compounds (such as phthalates). These {{may be associated with}} neurotoxic, <b>reprotoxic</b> or respiratory <b>effects</b> and may, therefore, be of particular interest so far as children are concerned. In a lesser extent, volatile organic compounds (such as aldehydes) that have mainly respiratory effects are still studied. Assessing exposure to metals is still of concern, with increasing interest in bioaccessibility. Most of the papers on microbial exposure focused on respiratory tract infections, especially asthma linked to allergens and bio-aerosols. Physical exposure includes noise and electromagnetic fields, and articles dealt with the auditory and non auditory effects of noise. Articles on radiofrequency electromagnetic fields mainly concerned questions about non-thermal effects and papers on extremely low-frequency magnetic fields focused on the characterization of exposure. The impact of the indoor environment on children's health cannot be assessed merely by considering the effect of these different types of exposure: this review highlights new findings and also discusses the interactions between agents in indoor environments and also with social aspects...|$|R

Glyphosate inhibits a plant enzyme which is essential for the biosynthesis of certain amino acids. This enzyme is not found in animals or humans. The approval procedure for glyphosate as an active ingredient is currently being revised at the European level. Germany is hereby the Rapporteur Member State (RMS). For the purpose of reassessing the health implications of this active substance, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has, in its capacity as the competent federal institute, examined and evaluated more than 150 new and original toxicological studies conducted in accordance with the OECD guidelines and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and over 900 new studies published in scientific journals, which included the analysis of numerous documents not previously considered.
