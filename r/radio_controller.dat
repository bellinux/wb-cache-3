25|$|By 3.50pm, some {{houses were}} alight {{in the suburbs}} of Duffy and Chapman, with the loss of a home in Holder soon after. An ACT Fire Brigade unit, perceiving the fire from a vantage point in Fyshwick, overrode {{instructions}} by the <b>radio</b> <b>controller</b> to ignore the signs and remain where they were. The unit headed to Duffy, attempting to alert both controllers and residents to the imminent danger. That unit was caught in a fire front on Warragamba Avenue Duffy at around 4.10pm, after having rescued at least two residents. Both the crew and residents were forced to flee the appliance when the fire struck.|$|E
2500|$|League {{had been}} a {{licensed}} pilot, and licensed engine and aircraft mechanic. He had barnstormed around in Missouri and Illinois with his [...] "flying circus," [...] prior to St. Louis hiring him as the first U.S. air traffic controller in 1929. He was stationed at the airfield in St. Louis, Missouri (now known as Lambert-St. Louis International Airport). Before the installation of a radio tower, he was a flagman who directed traffic via flags. His first [...] "control tower" [...] consisted of a wheelbarrow on which he mounted a beach umbrella for the summer heat. In it he carried a beach chair, his lunch, water, a note pad {{and a pair of}} signal flags to direct the aircraft. He used a checkered flag to indicate to the pilot [...] "GO", i.e. proceed, or a red flag to indicate the pilot should [...] "HOLD" [...] their position. He kept warm out on the field in the winters by wearing a padded flying suit. When a radio tower was installed in the early 1930s, he became the airport's first <b>radio</b> <b>controller.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Radio</b> Frequency <b>controllers</b> {{were not}} {{possible}} in the late 1980s as the early digital RF links were bulky and used too much power to be useful in battery-powered devices. However, advancements in integrated circuits made <b>radio</b> <b>controllers</b> for game consoles commercially viable only a decade later. The WaveBird, released in 2002, solved previous usability problems of wireless controllers by relying on radio frequency communication instead of infrared, allowing the controller to be used anywhere within 6 meters (20 ft) of the console. [...] Although Nintendo only certifies the WaveBird to work within this 6 meter (20 ft) range, tests have proven that they may work as far as 27.5 meters (90 ft) on all 16 different channels.|$|R

50|$|The set {{was built}} on {{platform}} raised four feet above the ground, with trap doors constructed at many points so that ALF could appear almost anywhere; Fusco operated him from underneath, so the unoccupied holes {{all over the floor}} were deep and treacherous. The trapdoors had to be reset multiple times, sometimes during a single scene. Fusco was the principal puppeteer, and used his right hand to control ALF's mouth, while the left controlled ALF's left arm. Second puppeteer Lisa Buckley assisted Fusco beneath the stage, operating ALF's right arm. There was additionally a third puppeteer, Bob Fappiano, who controlled ALF's facial and ear movements via a <b>radio</b> <b>controller</b> offscreen. During tapings, Fusco would wear a head-mounted microphone to record ALF's voice. The process resulted in numerous mistakes and retakes, making it impossible to record ALF in front of a live audience. A laugh track was added during post-production.|$|E
