40|$|This {{report is}} {{intended}} to be a supplement to ORNL/TM- 12398, Steady-State Thermal-Hydraulic Design Analysis of the Advanced Neutron Source Reactor. It updates the core thermal-hydrualic design to the latest three-element configuration and also provides the most recent information on the thermal-hydraulic statistical uncertainty analysis. In addition, it includes calculations of beam tube cooling and control <b>rod</b> <b>lift</b> forces, which were not addressed in the initial report. This report describes work that is a snapshot in time as it stood {{at the end of the}} project. The three-element core calculations include a description of changes made to the overall coolant system; however, most of the analysis is focused on fuel loading thermal-hydraulic calculations. This analysis uses updated uncertainty values and indicates that a two-dimensional fuel grading in the three-element core would still be necessary to meet the desired operating and safety criteria. Analysis of cooling in the reflector tank examines various cooling options for the reflector tank components. This work investigated multiple forced convection designs as well as natural convection cooling requirements. Lift forces on the inner control rods caused by the upward coolant flow were also examined. Initial control rod designs were such that a sheared control rod would tend to lift because of flow forces. Design changes were recommended that would eliminate this issue. They included geometry changes to the inner control rod cooling channels, changes to the orificing in the central hole region, and reduction of inner control rod coolant velocity...|$|E
50|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>rod</b> system ran {{vertically}} up the mineshaft, {{either to}} transfer {{power to the}} individual sets of shaft pumps (when they were known as pump rods) or, {{in the case of}} man engines, to operate the man engine rods. In some cases the <b>lifting</b> <b>rod</b> system performed both duties. It consisted of roughly 19 to 20 centimetre thick squared spruce timbers. The poles were dovetailed at the ends and sides and were fixed to one another with correspondingly mortised wooden joints (Holzlaschen). These joints were tightly bound {{to the ends of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>rods</b> with iron collars. In addition the iron collars were prevented from slipping by bolts inserted through them. At set distances there were also hooks on the sides that were used to hang the piston rods (Kolbenstangen). So that the horizontal movement of the flat rods could be turned into a vertical movement, a rotating cross-shaped lever (Kunstkreuz) was fitted to the <b>lifting</b> <b>rods.</b> Connexion to the cross lever was achieved using a crank (Kunstschloss). To balance the load it was usual to have two <b>lifting</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R

50|$|Quadrajet carburetors have {{mechanical}} secondary {{throttle plates}} {{operated by a}} progressive linkage; the primaries open before the secondaries, and use on-demand air valve plates above the secondary throttle plates. The air valves are connected by a cam and linkage to the secondary fuel metering rods. As the airflow increases through the secondary bores, the air valves are pushed down, rotating a cam that lifts the secondary metering rods. The secondary rods are tapered {{in a similar fashion}} to the primary metering rods, effectively increasing the size of the fuel metering holes as the <b>rods</b> are <b>lifted</b> and delivering more fuel. Therefore, the position of the air valve will control both fuel and air flow through the secondary venturis, even if the secondary throttle plates are fully opened.

50|$|The {{experiment}} {{began as}} computer models that suggested when light is incident {{on a tiny}} object shaped like a wing, a stable lift {{force is applied to}} the particle. Then the researchers decided to do physical experiments in the laboratory, and they created tiny, transparent, micrometer-sized rods that were flat on one side and rounded on the other, rather like airplane wings. They immersed the lightfoils in water and bombarded them with 130 mW infrared laser light from underneath the chamber. Radiation pressure pushes the particles along the direction of propagation, this is called the scatter force, but the excitement came when the particles were forced to the side in a direction perpendicular to the direction of propagating light. The transverse force on the particles is the lift force. The researchers discovered not only that the <b>rods</b> experienced stable <b>lift,</b> but that, depending on refractive index, the rod could have up to two stable angles of attack it rotated to when exposed to the laser light.

On 10 August 1985, the submarine was being refuelled at the Chazhma Bay naval facility near Vladivostok. The submarine had been refuelled and the reactor tank lid was being replaced. The lid was laid incorrectly {{and had to}} be lifted again with the control rods attached. A beam was supposed to prevent the lid from being lifted too far, but this beam was positioned incorrectly, and the lid with control <b>rods</b> was <b>lifted</b> up too far. At 10:55 AM the starboard reactor became prompt critical, resulting in a criticality excursion of about 5&middot;1018 fissions and a thermal/steam explosion. The explosion expelled the new load of fuel, destroyed the machine enclosures, ruptured the submarine's pressure hull and aft bulkhead, and partially destroyed the fuelling shack, with the shack's roof falling 70 metres away in the water. A fire followed, which was extinguished after 4 hours, after which assessment of the radioactive contamination began. Most of the radioactive debris fell within 50-100 metres of the submarine, but a cloud of radioactive gas and particulates blew to the northwest across a 6 km stretch of the Dunay Peninsula, missing the town of Shkotovo-22, 1.5 km from the dock. The contaminated forest area was later surveyed as 2 km2 in a swath 3.5 km long and 200 to 650 metres wide. Initial estimates of the radioactive release were about 74 PBq (2 MCi) of noble gases and 185 PBq (5 MCi) of other fission products, but most of this was short-lived isotopes; the estimated release inventory one hour after the accident was about 37 TBq (1000 Ci) of non-noble fission products.

40|$|Experimental {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to investigate the scale-effect problem associated with the ventilation of vertical, semi-submerged cylindrical <b>rods</b> and streamlined <b>lifting</b> surfaces. Several of the rods were coated with Teflon, a non-wetting material. Two types of ventilation [...] creeping and flash [...] have been observed for these shapes. Data for the large-diameter rods can be correlated with the Froude number, whereas uncoated rods of small diameter require consideration of several parameters. The use of Teflon-coated rods improved the Froude number correlation for the rods of small diameter. Ventilation of vertical, lifting struts is primarily a function of velocity, yaw angle, submergence, and foil shape. Ventilation data of two foil shapes at high yaw angles can be correlated with the Froude number based on chord. Ventilation data at low yaw angles have not been successfully analyzed. Some data are presented for the spanwise and chordwise pressure distributions about a surface-piercing dihedral hydrofoil (NACA 0012) at several angles of attack and dihedral angles.
