5|$|The track {{had been}} patched up {{prior to the}} weekend's racing using a {{synthetic}} <b>rubber</b> <b>compound,</b> and it had remained secure throughout the practice and qualifying sessions, {{as well as the}} Grand-Am and Indy Lights races. However, the Dallara DW12's aerodynamic ground force effects acted to pull the compound out. After assessing the track conditions, {{the decision was made to}} attempt to repair the track and restart the race. Marshalls and track workers started to pull the loose strips up from the track, and a quick drying concrete was used to fill the troughs. The repairs were held up for a short time when a crew was despatched to collect more of the concrete, as the on-site resources had been used up, but eventually the race director was happy the race could restart. Kanaan and Power drove around to survey the repairs, acting as driver representatives, and although Kanaan particularly did not sound confident that they would hold up, they agreed to try and continue racing. There was some confusion about the rules of the restart; no repairs were allowed, and the teams could change tires, but had to remain on the same compound. This led to J.R. Hildebrand suffering a one lap penalty as his car required repair work, and a number of drivers being angered at having to stay on the harder tires, which were the slower compound.|$|E
500|$|The Malaysian {{race was}} the first at which the tyre {{compounds}} used on the cars were differentiated by a white stripe painted in the tyre treads. Since {{the beginning of the}} 2007 Formula One season, teams had been obliged to use two different kinds of tyre on each car during the race: a 'prime' tyre and an 'option' tyre. The prime tyre has a harder <b>rubber</b> <b>compound</b> and the option tyre a softer one. In general terms, a softer tyre is likely to grip better and provide a higher cornering speed. Conversely, a harder tyre will often be slower, but may last longer. Formula One cars typically use between two and four sets of tyres during a race and using harder tyres may allow fewer pit stops to change tyres. Track conditions, the car characteristics or driving style can reduce or even reverse these differences. In Australia two weeks earlier, the softer tyres were marked with a small white circle to facilitate understanding of each driver's tyre strategy, but commentators and spectators were unable to distinguish the two compounds even at slow speeds. The idea of the white stripe was tested during the test session a week before the Malaysian round of the season. The white stripe was applied with paint marker pens. Over the weekend 160 pens were used. Overall reaction to this system was positive, with the Williams team's technical director Sam Michael, {{who came up with the}} initial idea, calling it a [...] "pretty good solution".|$|E
2500|$|Squash {{balls are}} between 39.5 and 40.5mm in diameter, {{and have a}} weight of 23 to 25grams. They are made with two pieces of <b>rubber</b> <b>compound,</b> glued {{together}} to form a hollow sphere and buffed to a matte finish. Different balls are provided for varying temperature and atmospheric conditions and standards of play: more experienced players use slow balls that have less bounce than those used by less experienced players (slower balls tend to [...] "die" [...] in court corners, rather than [...] "standing up" [...] to allow easier shots). [...] Depending on its specific rubber composition, a squash ball has the property that it bounces more at higher temperatures. Squash balls must be hit dozens of times to warm them up {{at the beginning of a}} session; cold squash balls have very little bounce.|$|E

The sludge from the weighed ingredients of glass batch in the glass production was used in the position of the alternative filler. This alternative filler was modified by using of three silanes: 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane, bis(triethoxysilyl) propyl-tetrasulfide and 3 -(triethoxysilyl) propyl-methacrylate and was applied into <b>rubber</b> <b>compounds.</b> The composition differences of <b>rubber</b> <b>compounds</b> were based on the different amount and type of filler.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was related to {{development}} of economically viable method of extraction of lignin from sawdust {{in order to produce}} additive capable to improve physical mechanical and aging properties of <b>rubber</b> <b>compounds.</b> Five methods were developed and performed to isolate lignin from sawdust. They were delignification, acidolysis with 5 M Hydrochloric acid, acidolysis with 10 M Hydrochloric acid, ethanolysis and extraction with acetone. Chemical structure of produced lignin samples was identified with Furior Transform Infra Red spectrometer (FTIR). Analysis of FTIR spectra showed good' conformity of all wave numbers at which specified peaks of experimented and reference lignin samples were observed. Acidolysis of sawdust with 10 M hydrochloric acid was found the most efficient for lignin extraction. This lignin was proceeded as a filler for <b>rubber</b> <b>compounds.</b> Properties of <b>rubber</b> <b>compounds</b> extended with produced lignin samples were determined. The test results showed that lignin was capable to improve properties of <b>rubber</b> <b>compounds</b> to the level achieved with carbon black and imported lignin filler samples, as well as resistance of rubber to prolong heat aging. An attempt was made to synthesize commercial antioxidants for rubber from extracted lignin sample. Methodology was developed and performed. Synthesized products were 2, 4, 6 three-tert-butyl phenol and 2, 6 di-tert butyl paracresol. Alcoholic and methoxyl groups present earlier in extracted lignin samples were replaced with methyl and tertiary butyl groups. These groups are particularly capable to donate hydrogen to an alkyl peroxy radical. The effects of substituent groups in the transition state involved not only electron transfer to the peroxy radical but electron delocalization in the aromatic ring.

The study confirms the accuracy of TG-DTG technique for rapid prediction of rheological properties of rubber blends.|$|R

30|$|The use of filler in rubber is {{important}} to obtain the desired physical and mechanical properties of <b>rubber</b> <b>compounds</b> [12]. The filler greatly effects on the overall properties of resulting <b>rubber</b> <b>compounds</b> [13]. The dispersion of filler in rubber matrix improves the physical properties {{as reported in the}} literature [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. The dispersion of good filler in rubber matrix is attained by the nature of rubber or rubber kind, structure of filler, and mixing sequence and their condition. Generally, nonblack fillers, such as silica, calcium carbonate, talc, aluminum oxide, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and zirconium oxide, are used as fillers or co-fillers in <b>rubber</b> <b>compounding,</b> thermoplastics, and thermosetting [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26].|$|R
