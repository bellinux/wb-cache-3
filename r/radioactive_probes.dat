50|$|In 1974 Rudolf Jaenisch {{created a}} {{transgenic}} mouse by introducing foreign DNA into its embryo, {{making it the}} world’s first transgenic animal. Jaenisch was studying mammalian cells infected with simian virus 40 (SV40) when he happened to read a paper from Beatrice Mintz describing the generation of chimera mice. He took his SV40 samples to Mintz's lab and injected them into early mouse embryos expecting tumours to develop. The mice appeared normal, but after using <b>radioactive</b> <b>probes</b> he discovered that the virus had integrated itself into the mice genome. However the mice did not pass the transgene to their offspring.

Z alpha activity is measured in a band-shift assay by using a <b>radioactive</b> <b>probe</b> consisting of a (dC-dG) 35 oligomer that has 50 % of the deoxycytosines replaced with 5 -bromodeoxycytosine.

40|$|A {{variety of}} nuclear {{techniques}} {{rely on the}} incorporation of radioactive atoms to investigate the microscopic structural, electronic and magnetic properties of a material. In the past, ion implantation has been utilized to introduce these <b>radioactive</b> <b>probes,</b> resulting in a depth distribution of typically several hundreds of A, and damaging the sample. Both implantation-related deficiencies are incompatible with the ever shrinking sizes relevant in nanostructures. This problem can be circumvented by using ultra-low energy ion beams - {{of the order of}} 5 eV, i. e. below the displacement energy of the substrate atoms. Consequently, the <b>radioactive</b> <b>probes</b> are "deposited" on top of the sample. without generating damage to the substrate. Since the implantation chamber is in vacuo connected with the molecular beam epitaxy deposition chamber, the probe layer can be introduced at any stage during the sample growth (from surface to interface) -with monolayer depth resolution. As an example, we discuss the ultra-low energy ion deposition of In- 111 in Cr. followed by analysis with perturbed angular correlation spectroscopy.

40|$|The {{development}} of vectors for gene therapy requires {{the definition of}} quality control parameters such as titration, contamination, transduction efficiency and biological effects in defined model systems. For most viral vectors, the classical titration by plaque formation is not applicable, because vectors are defective for replication and packaging cell lines are not always available. In particular, for vectors derived from the autonomous parvovirus MVM(p), the titration method used currently {{is based on the}} amplification of the viral genome inside an infected cell, which can then be revealed with a specific <b>radioactive</b> <b>probe</b> (J. Virol. 63 (1989) 1023). In situ hybridization allows to titrate wild-type virus as well as vectors, using probes that are specific for the substituted viral genes or for the transgene, respectively. This method is, however, time consuming, making the simultaneous titration of large numbers of samples difficult. The use of a <b>radioactive</b> <b>probe</b> requires an adequate facility. An ELISPOT method that allows for rapid titration of up to 23 vector stocks in one 96 well dish was devised. This method is based on the actual expression of the transgene. Compared to in situ hybridization, titers obtained by the ELISPOT method were in general equivalent or higher. However, for some vector stocks the ELISPOT titers were repeatedly lower, indicating that in situ hybridization does not give an accurate measure of transducing units. Our model system is recombinant parvovirus MVM expressing human IL 2, but the method should be adaptable to other vectors expressing transgenes that are secreted and for which antibodies are available.

40|$|The {{importation}} of sugarcane varieties {{from other countries}} {{is necessary for the}} breeding of new varieties suited to the diverse environmental conditions in South Africa. To prevent the introduction and spread of new diseases, it is crucial that any imported pathogens are detected before the cane is released from quarantine. Although not present in South Africa, Grassy Shoot (GS) and Sugarcane White Leaf (SCWL) are economically significant phytoplasmal diseases that cause yield loss in sugarcane in a number of countries. Despite phytoplasmas being important pathogens that have been implicated in more than 300 plant diseases worldwide, these organisms have as yet not been cultured in vitro. The most reliable and rapid method of detection has been the use of nested polymerase chain reaction directed to conserved sequences in the 16 S rRNA gene, where DNA isolation follows a phytoplasmal enrichment procedure. The process is both expensive and time consuming. This study investigated the use of FTA TM paper (Whatman BioScience) for DNA extraction, and the use of a <b>radioactive</b> <b>probe</b> in conjunction with a tissue blot procedure to detect phytoplasmas in sugarcane leaf samples exhibiting symptoms of GS and SCWL, and in Bermuda grass leaf samples showing symptoms of Bermuda Grass White Leaf disease. The FTA TM paper method was effective in extracting the DNA from which specific identifications could be made.
