40|$|In an {{exosphere}} {{like that}} of the Moon an ionospheric layer with a peak above its surface cannot form since the ionising radiation penetrates unattenuated to the surface. The ionisation of exospheric species in equilibrium with recombination could lead to appreciable concentrations of electron/ion pairs at the surface, because of the extremely slow loss of atomic ions by radiative recombination, if there were not a competing transport process. This is actually provided by the pick-up of ions by the solar wind leading to an extremely low surface concentration of iono-spheric plasma.

40|$|A new {{formulation}} of the previously introduced principle of locality is presented. The principle can be applied for modernization of the radio occultation (RO) remote sensing of the atmospheres and ionospheres of the Earth and other planets. The principle states that significant contributions to variations of the intensity and phase of the radio waves passing through a layered medium are connected with influence of the vicinities of tangential points where the refractivity gradient is perpendicular to the <b>radio</b> <b>ray</b> trajectory. The RO method assumes spherical symmetry of the investigated medium. In this case, if location of a tangent point relative to the spherical symmetry centre is known, the time derivatives of the RO signal phase and Doppler frequency variations can be recalculated into the refractive attenuation. Several important findings are consequences of the locality principle: (i) if position of the centre of symmetry is known, the total absorption along the ray path can be determined at a single frequency; (ii) {{in the case of}} low absorption the height, displacement from the <b>radio</b> <b>ray</b> perigee, and tilt of the inclined ionospheric (atmospheric) layers can be evaluated; (iii) the contributions of the layered and irregular structures in the RO signal can be separated and parameters of layers and turbulence can be measured at a single frequency using joint analysis of the intensity and phase variations. Specially for the Earth's troposphere, the altitude distributions of the weak total absorption (about of 1 – 4 db) of the radio waves at GPS frequencies corresponding to possible influence of the oxygen, water vapour, and hydrometeors can be measured with accuracy of about 0. 1 db at a single frequency. In accordance with the locality principle, a new index of ionospheric activity is introduced. This index is measured from the phase variations of radio waves passing through the ionosphere. Its high correlation with the S 4 scintillation index is established. This correlation indicates the significant influence of locally spherical symmetric ionospheric layers on variations of the phase and intensity of the RO signal passing through transionospheric communication links. Obtained results expand applicable domain of the RO method as a powerful remote sensing technique for geophysical and meteorological research...|$|E

Phase scintillations at frequencies {{much lower than the}} Fresnel frequency are caused by irregularities with scale sizes that are much larger than the size of the first Fresnel zone. Under such conditions, refraction effects can be taken into account and the phase fluctuations are due to the optical path changes of a radio wave (Pi et al., 1997). The low-frequency GPS phase fluctuations may be directly due to electron density changes along the <b>radio</b> <b>ray</b> path (or the total electron content (TEC) changes). Standard GPS observations, with a 30 s sampling, provide measurements of the irregularities at high latitudes with a scale size of the order of > 30 km. Effects of ionospheric irregularities on the GPS signals can be evaluated by measurements of the differential phase time rate of dual frequency (1.2 and 1.6 GHz) GPS signals (Aarons, 1997).|$|E
40|$|Occultation {{geometry}} is analyzed {{with a view}} toward eliminating all multipath {{resulting from}} layer effects. It is assumed that the spacecraft moves behind the planet with a constant velocity perpendicular to the direction from the spacecraft to the earth, and that for radio frequencies of 1 to 2 GHz the angle of refraction of a <b>radio</b> <b>ray</b> passing through the ionosphere is so small as to be imperceptible if drawn to scale. It is shown that if a particular amount of dispersion is inserted into the process at any stage prior to signal detection, the frequency vs time curve will be converted to a frequency vs ray asymptote height curve. Because there can be only one mode from any one ray asymptote height in a layered medium, frequency must be a single-valued function of this parameter. The introduction of an appropriate dispersion will therefore eliminate all multipath insofar as it is caused by spherically symmetric planetary layers. The degree of accuracy to be provided in flight and during postflight analysis is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} between the Doppler frequencies, eikonal acceleration, and refractive attenuations of the direct and reflected signals are established for bistatic and radio occultation experiments. These connections allow recalculating the Doppler shifts and the phase delays to the refractive attenuation (reflectivity cross section) and open {{a new avenue for}} potentially measuring the total absorption in the atmosphere at low elevation angles. The fundamental characteristics of bistatic remote sensing of the atmosphere and Earth&# 039;s surface such as the phase delay, reflection coefficient, reflectivity cross section, and Doppler shift of the reflected signals relative to the direct signals are obtained in analytical forms by taking into account the refraction and absorption effects in the atmosphere. Difference in the Doppler frequencies of the reflected and direct signals is proportional to the difference of the modified refractive index at the <b>radio</b> <b>ray</b> perigee and at the Earth&# 039;s surface. The obtained analytical results are in good agreement with the measurements data obtained during the MIR/GEO (wavelengths 2 and 32 cm), and CHAMP (wavelengths 19 and 24 cm) radio occultation experiments. Detecting the reflected signals in radio occultation data has opened new perspectives for bistatic monitoring of the atmosphere and Earth&# 039;s surface at low elevation angles. Experimental results of the propagation effects at low elevation angles are of great importance for fundamental theoretical investigation of radio waves propagation...|$|E

30|$|In {{space to}} earth {{geodetic}} techniques the atmosphere affects the radio wave propagation. In order {{to estimate the}} total non-zenith path delay several mapping functions have been proposed to scale the zenith delay to other elevations. For all of them the basic {{idea is that the}} ultimate direction of the ray path is exactly that of the vacuum elevation of the radio source, and this is used to estimate the delay. This is true when we consider VLBI observations from a distant radio source but not the case for satellites or other near-earth radio sources. In this case the radio source distance is no longer infinite, and we have to think of a slightly different <b>radio</b> <b>ray</b> direction. This may insert a reasonable error in delay estimation. Thus, for satellite observations, the source elevation angle must be corrected for the ray bending effect before we use it with a mapping function to scale the delay. This means that either we have to estimate this correction of the angle or we have to develop a model that includes the correction. In this report we evaluate the magnitude of the correction and discuss the way we can approach and map it. Another purpose of this report was to study different mapping functions used to predict the hydrostatic delay at low elevation angles. Also a study of models with constant terms shows that such a model optimized for a site or region can give satisfactory results.|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} bending {{effects on}} a <b>radio</b> <b>ray</b> of the {{horizontal and vertical}} gradient of refractivity are investigated. With the use of ray-curvature formulas developed by Wong, convenient differential equations governing the three-dimensional ray path are derived. It is also shown that the ratio of 'horizontal to vertical' bending effects is maximum when the ray is propagated in the vertical plane containing the horizontal gradient of refractivity. In a two-dimensional example, computations of path height {{as a function of}} horizontal distance are obtained by numerical integration. For this purpose, a regional space-time averaged exponential model is drawn from climatological studies of Bean and Thayer has been used. Even though this smoothed model and an extreme version of it derived synthetically by increasing the horizontal gradient everywhere by a factor of 10 have comparatively strong horizontal gradients, the 'horizontal bending' effect is virtually negligible. It is not implied, however, that this conclusion is necessarily applicable to an atmosphere exhibiting small-scale fluctuations in the refractivity pattern. The ray paths corresponding to the nonhomogeneous model are significantly different from those in a horizontally uniform atmosphere. The problem of replacing a nonhomogeneous model by an equivalent horizontally uniform one is also investigated. The choice of the best uniform atmosphere depends upon minimizing the rms height error over a designated horizontal path length, and this in turn requires the specification of several ray-propagation parameters in addition to the distribution of refractivity.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} principle of local interaction of radio waves with a refractive spherical medium is formulated and illustrated using the radio occultation (RO) method of remote sensing {{of the atmosphere}} and the ionosphere of the Earth and the planets. In accordance with this principle, the main contribution to variations of the amplitude and the phase of radio waves propagating through a medium makes a neighborhood of a tangential point, where the gradient of the refractive index is perpendicular to the radio wave trajectory. A necessary and sufficient condition (a criterion) is established to detect the displacement of the tangential point from the <b>radio</b> <b>ray</b> perigee using analysis of the RO experimental data. This criterion {{is applied to the}} identification and the location of layers in the atmosphere and the ionosphere by the use of Global Positioning System RO data. RO data from the CHAllenge Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) are used to validate the criterion introduced when significant variations of the amplitude and the phase of the RO signals are observed at the RO ray perigee altitudes below 80 km. The detected criterion opens a new avenue in terms of measuring the altitude and the slope of the atmospheric and ionospheric layers. This is important for the location determination of the wind shear and the direction of internal wave propagation in the lower ionosphere and possibly in the atmosphere. The new criterion provides an improved estimation of the altitude and the location of the ionospheric plasma layers compared with the backpropagation radio-holographic method previously used...|$|E
