40|$|A {{quality control}} method for {{combined}} online monitoring of weather radar antenna pointing biases and <b>receiver</b> <b>calibration</b> using solar signals detected by an operational radar is adapted for application to midrange radar data (80 - 150 km). As the original method was developed using long-range data, additional criteria based on robust statistical estimators are imposed {{in the sun}} signature detection and selection process, allowing to discard observations biased by ground clutter or precipitation and to remove very influential outliers. The validity ranges of the physical model describing the solar interferences detected by the scanning radar antenna are explicitly defined and an equation for estimation of the effective scanning width in reception is provided in a thorough theoretical derivation. The method proposed reveals its sensitivity {{to changes in the}} antenna pointing accuracy and <b>receiver</b> <b>calibration</b> when applied to operational data obtained with three C-band radars during one year. A comparative study on the goodness of fit between a three- and a five-parameter model highlights the effect on the stability and accuracy of the antenna and receiver parameters retrieved for each radar system, considering the dissimilar information content of the observations collected by each radar.

This improves the accuracy of the shortest baselines, which are the most significant ones due to the smoothness of the brightness temperature to measure.

40|$|The X-band Acquisition Aid (AAP) {{software}} is a low-cost acquisition {{aid for the}} Deep Space Network (DSN) antennas, and is used while acquiring a spacecraft shortly after it has launched. When enabled, the acquisition aid provides corrections to the antenna-predicted trajectory of the spacecraft {{to compensate for the}} variations that occur during the actual launch. The AAP software also provides the corrections to the antenna-predicted trajectory to the navigation team that uses the corrections to refine their model of the spacecraft in order to produce improved antenna-predicted trajectories for each spacecraft that passes over each complex. The software provides an automated Acquisition Aid <b>receiver</b> <b>calibration,</b> and provides graphical displays to the operator and remote viewers via an Ethernet connection. It has a Web server, and the remote workstations use the Firefox browser to view the displays. At any given time, only one operator can control any particular display in order to avoid conflicting commands from more than one control point. The configuration and control is accomplished solely via the graphical displays. The operator does not have to remember any commands. Only a few configuration parameters need to be changed, and can be saved to the appropriate spacecraft-dependent configuration file on the AAP s hard disk. AAP automates the calibration sequence by first commanding the antenna to the correct position, starting the <b>receiver</b> <b>calibration</b> sequence, and then providing the operator with the option of accepting or rejecting the new calibration parameters. If accepted, the new parameters are stored in the appropriate spacecraft-dependent configuration file.

30|$|Considering the {{responses}} of array antenna and RF cable do not vary so much over time and space, total responses including those of receivers are measured in a radio anechoic chamber. Strictly speaking, the radiation pattern of each antenna element, mutual coupling and deviation among RF cables should be properly calibrated. As far as this system employs a linear antenna array, the deviation of the radiation pattern of each antenna element cannot be eliminated by calibration processing since there exists cone ambiguity in the beamforming. Therefore we measured the calibration data only on the plane determined by the directional vector toward the maximum radiation pattern and the array axis. Moreover, the receiver is greatly affected by temperature, thus on-site calibration is necessary. For <b>receiver</b> <b>calibration,</b> we used the one-to-eight power divider calibrated by a vector network analyzer in advance.|$|E

40|$|B-modes in {{the cosmic}} {{microwave}} background (CMB) polarization is a smoking gun signature of the inflationary universe. To achieve better sensitivity to this faint signal, CMB polarization experiments aim to maximize the number of detector elements, resulting in a large focal plane receiver. Detector calibration of the polarization response becomes essential. It is extremely useful to be able to calibrate 'simultaneously' all detectors on the large focal plane. We developed a novel calibration system that rotates a large 'sparse' grid of metal wires, in front of and fully covering the field of view of the focal plane receiver. Polarized radiation is created via the reflection of ambient temperature from the wire surface. Since the detector has a finite beam size, the observed signal is smeared according to the beam property. The resulting smeared polarized radiation has a reasonable intensity (a few Kelvin or less) compared to the sky temperature ({approx} 10 K observing condition). The system played a successful role for <b>receiver</b> <b>calibration</b> of QUIET, a CMB polarization experiment located in the Atacama desert in Chile.

This memo improves on [Guilloteau & Moreno, memo 371] by using more accurate derivations and better estimates of the receiver saturation temperatures. It is shown that to reach a given precision in calibration, the saturation on the vane must be less than this precision. Suitable values for the vane transparencies are given. The vane transmission can be calibrated {{in a few minutes}} (at mm wavelengths) to 1 hour (above 275 GHz) by measurement of an astronomical source (nearby quasar). A derivation of the saturation temperature from a measurement on the vane and on an ambient load is presented. The case of partial saturation on the vane is explored. Using the derived saturation temperature in this case requires a more accurate measurement of the vane transmission, but {{is the only way to}} reach the specified accuracy.

After the first sounding, Väisälä continued with further development and tests until a radiosonde could be brought into production and deliveries started in 1936. From the very start, Vaisala was an international business, exporting 95 percent of the production. As the Vaisala radiosonde became internationally renowned, the demand for them increased. In 1944, Prof. Väisälä established a company called Mittari Oy ("Gauge Incorporated") and set up manufacturing facilities for radiosonde systems. The first sounding system included a semi-automatic radiosonde <b>receiver,</b> a <b>calibration</b> device and a ground check set. The company employed 13 people at the time.

The first systematic observations of ELF electromagnetic fields at the Jagiellonian University were undertaken in 1994. At the beginning the measurements were carried out sporadically, during expeditions to sparsely populated areas of the Bieszczady Mountains in the southeast of Poland. In 2004, an automatic Hylaty ELF station was built there, in a very low electromagnetic noise environment, which enabled continuous recording of the magnetic field components of the ELF electromagnetic field in the frequency range below 60 [*]Hz.

To probe this redshifted signal, EDGES High-Band conducts single-antenna measurements in the frequency range 90 - 190 MHz from the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory in Western Australia. In this paper, we describe the current strategy for calibration of the EDGES High-Band receiver and report calibration results for the instrument used in the 2015 - 2016 observational campaign. We propagate uncertainties in the <b>receiver</b> <b>calibration</b> measurements to the antenna temperature using a Monte Carlo approach. We define a performance objective of 1 mK residual RMS after modeling foreground subtraction from a fiducial temperature spectrum using a five-term polynomial. Most of the calibration uncertainties yield residuals of 1 mK or less at 95 % confidence. However, current uncertainties in the antenna and receiver reflection coefficients can lead to residuals of up to 20 mK even in low-foreground sky regions. These dominant residuals could be reduced by 1) improving the accuracy in reflection measurements, especially their phase 2) improving the impedance match at the antenna-receiver interface, and 3) decreasing the changes with frequency of the antenna reflection phase.
