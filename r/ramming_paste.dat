50|$|The Hall-Héroult {{electrolysis}} {{process is}} the major production route for primary aluminium. An electrolysis cell is made of a steel shell {{with a series of}} insulating linings of refractory materials. The cell consists of a brick-lined outer steel shell as a container and support. Inside the shell, cathode blocks are cemented together by <b>ramming</b> <b>paste.</b> The top lining is in contact with the molten metal and acts as the cathode. The molten electrolyte is maintained at high temperature inside the cell. The prebaked anode is also made of carbon in the form of large sintered blocks suspended in the electrolyte. A single Soderberg electrode or a number of prebaked carbon blocks are used as anode, while the principal formulation and the fundamental reactions occurring on their surface are the same.|$|E

However, <b>ramming</b> <b>paste</b> {{used to be a}} hazardous product and needs special precautions for handling and application. A 100 % eco-friendly cold <b>ramming</b> <b>paste</b> has been developed by Carbone Savoie and tested at Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA) sites. A test has also been developed by Carbone Savoie to follow-up, identify and quantify emissions during the baking of paste up to 1000 °C. Physico-chemical characteristics of various pastes are presented, together with their composition in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and volatile organic compounds (VOC), determined by an accredited laboratory and the results of emissions during paste baking. The results of pot operation at the EGA sites show no harmful impact on pot preheat, early operation, or regular operation performance. Pot performance data are given for comparison.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{mechanical}} behavior of <b>ramming</b> <b>paste,</b> representative laboratory samples must be produced for experimental characterization. Experimental data {{are necessary to}} feed three-dimensional creep model where radial strain measurements are required. It is thus imperative to perform measurements on a sample large enough to get significant radial strain amplitude. However, the ISO standard fabrication method is restricted to small-size samples. In the present paper, a different compaction process, adapted from the Proctor method, is proposed {{in order to get}} larger cylindrical samples of 100 mm diameter and 200 mm height. The <b>ramming</b> <b>paste</b> samples are produced in multilayer by dynamic compaction, using a falling weight in a circular pattern over the tamped surface.

40|$|Digitization of the {{geologic}} maps {{is confusing}} and time consuming process. If {{the same person}} is digitizing the data and converting it into the GIS, the way is not so important, but the result is. However, for parallel digitization, which means digitization {{of two or more}} geological maps by different users at the same time, user intervention brings confusion problems while converting digitized data into the GIS. For this reason, before initiating the project, the standards of geological map digitization should be well performed. A geological map can contain limited number of common features such as faults, folds, types of formation boundaries and dip-strike measurements. They should be represented with common attributes in all maps. For that reason a task bar is prepared for use in any digitization software that standardizes the attributes of digitized data. This task bar provides the attributes of common geological features. While digitizing, user finds the icon of the feature on the task bar and pushes that button. The attribute is copied into the PC’s <b>ram</b> and user <b>pastes</b> it into the necessary field. One advantage of this method is to simplify the digitization process and so it is much faster than non standardized and unorganized digitization. Another advantage is the digitizing may be done by people having no geological background. Using this method, 80 pieces of 1 / 50, 000 scaled geological map are converted into the GIS for about 4 months with two digitizing person. 1...|$|R
40|$|Biomedical Tissue Engineering, Biomaterials, and Medical Devices Poster SessionBioactive {{glasses are}} {{promising}} materials for bone scaffolds {{due to their}} ability to assist in tissue regeneration. When implanted in vivo, bioactive glasses can convert to hydroxyapatite, the main mineral constituent of human bone and form a strong bond with the surrounding tissues, providing an advantage over polymer scaffold materials. Bone scaffold fabrication using additive manufacturing (solid freeform fabrication) methods provides control over design and fabrication of pores in the scaffold. 13 - 93 bioglass (manufactured by Mo-Sci Corporation), a third-generation bioactive and resorbable material designed to accelerate the body's natural ability to heal itself, was used in the research described herein to fabricate bone scaffolds using two different additive manufacturing methods - Selective Laser Sintering and Freeze Extrusion Fabrication. Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is a process where a laser light is controlled to selectively sinter the particles in a powder bed layer-by-layer to fabricate a 3 D part based on a CAD model. The SLS machine used in this research was a DTM Sinterstation 2000. 13 - 93 bioglass mixed with stearic acid (as the polymer binder) by ball milling was used as the powder feedstock for the SLS machine. The fabricated green scaffolds underwent binder burnout to remove the stearic acid binder and then sintered at temperatures between 6500 C and 7000 C. After sintering, the scaffolds were mechanically tested, achieving a maximum compressive strength of 16 MPa for scaffolds with 60 % apparent porosity. Bioactivity results showed the ability of the SLS scaffolds to support the growth of osteoblastic cells. Scanning electron microsocopy analysis and MTT formazan formation measurements provided evidence that the bioglass scaffolds fabricated by the SLS process offer a surface capable of supporting robust cell growth. Freeze Extrusion Fabrication (FEF) is a process where an aqueous-based glass paste is extruded and deposited layer-by-layer to fabricate a 3 D part in a sub-freezing temperature environment. The FEF system, developed at Missouri S&T, consists of a 3 -axis positioning system, a <b>ram</b> extruder for <b>paste</b> extrusion, and position and force sensors for measurement and control. Bioglass slurry was prepared by ball milling 13 - 93 bioglass particles along with a dispersant (surfynol) and a binder (aquazol). Further, a lubricant (PEG- 400) was added to the paste to aid in extrusion. The bioglass slurry was then heated to obtain bioglass paste. Scaffolds with varying pore sizes from 300 μm to 800 μm were successfully fabricated using the FEF process. Post processing of green scaffolds, including binder burnout and sintering, is currently being performed. Scaffolds produced by the FEF process will be evaluated and compared with the scaffolds obtained using the SLS process...|$|R
40|$|Silicomanganese (SiMn) as an alloy {{supplies}} silicon and manganese to the steelmaking industry. It {{is produced}} through carbothermic reduction in a submerged arc furnace. The slag and metal are typically tapped through a single-level tap hole at 50 K (50 C) below the process temperature of 1873 K to 1923 K (1600 C to 1650 C). In one tapblock refractory design configuration, the tap hole is installed as a carbon tapblock and rebuilt {{during the life}} of the lining using carbon-based cold <b>ramming</b> <b>paste.</b> The carbon tapblock lasts {{for a number of years}} and <b>ramming</b> <b>paste</b> only for months. The purpose of the study presented here was to determine to what extent chemical reactions between carbon-based refractory and slag or metal in the tap hole of a SiMn furnace can contribute to wear of tap-hole refractory. The results of the study are reported in two parts. In Part I, the results of thermodynamic calculations of the potential for chemical reaction between carbon-based refractory material and slag or metal are reported. The results were tested experimentally using pure graphite and synthetic SiMn slag (produced from pure oxides). The paper also reports the composition, microstructure, and phases of industrial SiMn slag, and commercially available carbon block and cold <b>ramming</b> <b>paste</b> refractory materials. These compositions were used in predicted equilibria of refractory–slag reactions. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that reaction between SiMn slag and carbonbased tap-hole refractory is possible, and experiments with nominally pure materials support this. However, practical refractory materials are by no means pure materials, and contain secondary phases and porosity which can be expected to affect reaction with slag.

40|$|Tap hole {{refractories}} constitute critical {{parts of}} the refractory lining in submerged arc furnaces. For several hours every day, molten slag and metal flow through the tap hole calling for thorough selection of refractory materials able to withstand the intense thermal, corrosive and erosive conditions present in this area. Carbon-based refractories have shown excellent thermal properties and high strength, as well as low wettability towards process materials, and are therefore utilized in silicomanganese production furnaces both as side lining, in the hearth, and in the tap hole area. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to determine the compatibility of five refractory materials utilized in the tap hole area of an industrial silicomanganese furnace with two industrial silicomanganese slags: 	Investigate the suitability of the selected refractory materials for confining the process materials during industrial production of silicomanganese alloys. 	Identify critical refractory wear mechanisms upon slag-refractory interaction at industrial tapping temperatures. Compatibilities were investigated through 12 static crucible tests and two static plate tests in a vertical tube furnace redesigned during this investigation. Slag-refractory interaction was studied after two and four hours holding time at 1367 °C ± 1. 8 °C, 1464 °C ± 2. 1 °C and 1600 °C - 0. 6 °C /+ 0. 2 °C. Holding temperatures were verified through the wire-bridge method at the melting points of gold and palladium. Visual inspection, as well as optical microscopy and SEM, were utilized to examine the samples after heat treatment. During compatibility experiments, dissolution of refractory matrix due to solubility of oxide refractory binder phases in silicomanganese slags was observed, as well as disintegration of refractory particles due to gas formation at slag-refractory interface, or expansion as a result of phase transformations in refractory material. Direct reduction of manganese oxide from slags and iron oxide present in refractories by carbon and silicon carbide was also observed. Establishment of partial slag-metal equilibriums between iron oxide and silicon metal originally present in slag was observed, as well as formation of silicon carbide at the slag-refractory interfaces. The latter may serve to protect the refractory from wear caused by slags. Based on observations of extensive interaction between silicomanganese slag sample I and <b>ramming</b> <b>paste</b> at 1600 °C, the <b>ramming</b> <b>paste</b> investigated cannot be recommended for usage during tap block repair in an industrial silicomanganese furnace. Incipient electrode paste disintegration by slags and silicon carbide tap block slag interaction were observed after compatibility tests at 1464 °C, calling for further investigations of these refractory materials. Tap hole clay and carbon tap block showed minimal signs of interaction with process materials at 1464 °C. Refractory porosity seemed to have a larger effect on refractory wear than refractory ash content. Contrary to industrial observations, silicomanganese slag sample I was more corrosive towards the <b>ramming</b> <b>paste</b> and electrode paste investigated than silicomanganese slag sample II...|$|E
40|$|In April 2013 a 48 MVA {{submerged}} {{arc furnace}} producing silicomanganese was excavated in South Africa.

A refractory wear profile of the tap-hole area with affected hearth and sidewall refractory was obtained in elevation. The carbon <b>ramming</b> <b>paste</b> in front of, above, and below the tap-hole was worn, as was the SiC with which the tap-hole was built. A clay mushroom formed but was detached from the refractories. Thermodynamic and mass-transfer calculations were conducted to quantify the potential for wear by chemical reaction between refractory and slag and refractory and metal in the tap-hole area.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} {{presented}} here {{was to investigate the}} potential for chemical wear of carbon-based refractory materials in a silicomanganese furnace tap-hole. In the study, three research questions were addressed: 1. Is chemical reaction between refractory and slag or refractory and metal a potential wear mechanism? 2. Is the choice in carbon-based refractory material important from a tap-hole refractory life perspective? 3. What are the implications {{for the life of the}} tap-hole in a SiMn furnace? To study the potential for chemical wear, thermodynamic calculations were conducted to determine the potential for the formation of SiC and SiMn at 1600 °C through reduction of SiO 2 and MnO and dissolution of C (and subsequent reaction with Si) in metal. The thermodynamic calculations were based on published [1] metal and slag composition and carbon. Cup test experiments based on synthetic slag and graphite proved SiC formation conclusively, but not SiMn formation. To study the effect of the choice in carbon-based refractory material, two types of refractory materials – carbon block and <b>ramming</b> <b>paste</b> – available commercially and industrial slag were sourced, prepared and characterised. Wettability studies proved the formation of SiC at 1588 °C with slag being wetting towards refractory in an argon atmosphere and non-wetting in a CO-atmosphere. Under wetting conditions, the wetting angle of slag on carbon block was slightly higher (50 °) at holding temperature compared to that of <b>ramming</b> <b>paste</b> (30 °). Under non-wetting conditions the angles were 160 ° and 150 ° respectively. Cup test experiments based on industrial slag and carbon-based refractory material proved both SiC and SiMn formation at 1600 °C conclusively and confirmed the wetting behaviour of slag towards refractory at larger scale. To study the implications for the life of the tap-hole in a SiMn furnace, the tap-hole of a 48 MVA SiMn furnace was excavated and profiled. The wear predicted by thermodynamic modelling was supported by mass flow calculations. It was concluded that chemical reaction between carbon-based refractory materials and slag and metal is one of the mechanisms responsible for wear in the tap-hole of a silicomanganese furnace.

40|$|<b>Ramming</b> <b>paste</b> is a {{particular}} type of carbon paste which is used as lining for electric smelting furnaces and Hall-Héroult cells for the production of aluminium. The purpose of this lining is to form an impenetrable barrier, keeping the liquid within the furnace. If the lining has cracks or holes, then liquid can escape, which can lead to safety risks and financial losses, so the integrity of the lining is of great importance. In the present study, we develop a first principles mathematical model for the heat and mass transfer processes occurring during the baking of carbon paste. We then obtain numerical simulations using this model and compare the simulation results to experimental data, demonstrating that the model solutions do indeed describe and predict realistic behaviors of the carbon paste baking process. The simulations indicate a strong pressure buildup during the evaporation of water from fresh paste during the baking process, which is likely to lead to cracking of the paste as it hardens. Furthermore, we are able to show that more gradual heating during the baking process can lower the maximal pressures predicted by the model, which in turn may reduce the prevalence of cracks within the hardened paste...|$|E

Clear evidence was found of chemical reaction at approximately 1870 K (approximately 1600 C), forming SiC and, it appears, metal droplets. Both carbon block and <b>ramming</b> <b>paste</b> refractory reacted with slag, with preferential attack on and penetration into the binder phase rather than aggregate particles. The two types of carbon-based refractory materials showed similar extents of chemical reaction observed as wetting and penetration in the laboratory tests. The differences in refractory life observed practically in industrial furnaces should therefore be attributed to wear mechanisms other than pure chemical wear as studied in this work.

40|$|Si 3 N 4 -bonded SiC {{materials}} {{have become the}} state-of-the-art sidewall block materials used in aluminium electrolysis cells. Despite its outstanding properties, the material properties degradate in the cell over time. The mineralogical transformations and chemical reactions cause changes in the physical and thermal properties, which influence the thermal balance of the electrolysis cell. Sodium {{plays an important role}} in the degradation of the sidewall block, as in the other parts of the cathode lining, and the transportation of sodium in the cathode lining has been in focus in the study in order to understand the degradation mechanisms. Commercial virgin Si 3 N 4 -bonded SiC {{materials have}} been thoroughly characterized with respect to microstructure and phase composition. α -Si 3 N 4 was found more pronounced in the area close to the surface of the virgin block than in the center by refinement of X-ray diffraction patterns. The morphology of the phases of the materials was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The needle grains in the nitride binder were confirmed to be α -Si 3 N 4 by transmission electron microscopy, while β -Si 3 N 4 was proposed to be hexagonal rod shaped grains. The apparent porosity was lower in the area close to the surface while the density was higher. The degradation of the Si 3 N 4 -bonded SiC materials was studied by investigating spent blocks. The degradation mechanisms in the gas zone (top part) and the electrolyte zone (bottom part) of the spent sidewall block were different due to the different chemical environments in the cell. In the electrolyte zone, the degradation involves reactions with sodium, and the main degradation phase was Na 2 SiO 3 or a mixture of Na 2 SiO 3 and Na 2 Si 2 O 5. The presence of only Na 2 SiO 3 points to a higher chemical potential of sodium. The formed silicates filled up the pores and dramatically decreased the apparent porosity. The layer structure of the sodium silicate was confirmed by SEM. In the gas zone, the degradation mechanism was more complicated. The material underwent active oxidation, and the main degradation phase was Si 2 ON 2 or cristobalite depending on the partial pressure of oxygen. The apparent porosity and density of the bulk material was not significantly changed compared to the virgin material. At the surface of the block towards the pot, material loss was observed. The remaining material at the surface appeared porous and a significantly higher porosity was inferred. The needles in the binder in the gas zone was found thinner compared to the ones found in the virgin material. HF was proposed to play an important role in the material loss at the surface and the change in the morphology of the binder. The thermal conductivity of the Si 3 N 4 -bonded SiC materials before and after operation was measured by the lasher flash method. The thermal conductivity was found to be higher in the area close to the surface of the virgin block than in the center despite a higher apparent porosity at the surface. Moreover, the thermal conductivity dropped dramatically in both the electrolyte zone and the gas zone of the spent blocks. The variation in the thermal conductivity of the material was modeled taking into account the phase composition, the apparent porosity and the microstructure related properties such as grain boundary resistance, pore shape and orientation factor and finally a thermal resistance layer. Both analytical models and computer simulations showed that the microstructure evolution had a strong influence on the thermal conductivity. Furthermore, the computer simulation demonstrated that the drop in the thermal conductivity of the sidewall block would result in a hotter surface of the block towards the bath and a thinner side ledge. Sodium diffusion and reaction throughout the whole cathode lining has been investigated by a computer simulation by taking into consideration the different degradation mechanisms in each material of the cathode lining. The simulation demonstrated that the dominant transport of sodium in the carbon cathode was solid phase diffusion. The diffusion in the sidewall block was gas phase diffusion, and the diffusion is to some degree limited by the chemical reactions. Using the diffusion constant of sodium in the refractory layer close to the sodium selfdiffusion in an albite like molten oxide reproduced the sodium penetration depth found in autopsies. As shown in the work, sodium causes the severe degradation in the cathode lining. Moreover, it “opens” the way for the bath to penetrate into the cathode lining resulting in more severe degradation. Two approaches were applied to estimate the bath infiltration rate into the carbon cathode block. The simulations demonstrated that the infiltration rate was determined by the changes in the wetting property of the carbon material towards the bath, meaning that it was determined by the sodium diffusion rate, which explains that sodium always infiltrates faster than the bath. A diffusion barrier (like a steel plate or a chemical barrier) is recommended to be placed between the <b>ramming</b> <b>paste</b> (big joint) and the sidewall block, which could inhibit/reduce the sodium infiltration into the sidewall block and so eliminate further degradation. That will not only improve the chemical stability of the sidewall block but also its thermal stability, and thereby maintain the thermal balance during the cell operation. This may also open up for heat recovery from the heat flux through the side walls. PhD i materialteknologiPhD in Materials Technolog...|$|E
