40|$|The iron {{chlorosis}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} diffused plant disease, which affects their growth and reduces the yield of harvests. This disease is caused by the iron deficiency and it is highlighted by the progressive yellowing of plants due to the reduction of chlorophyll production. The most efficient and diffused therapy against the iron chlorosis is the use of chelating agents and, among them, the o,o-EDDHA/Fe 3 +, the most stable isomer of EDDHA, is the most used due to its capacity to guarantee a prolonged treatment. The aim of this work is to develop a production process environment friendly, based on the recovering and <b>recycling</b> of <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> to minimize the waste produced.

NMMO retains all the advantages of the ionic liquids ability to dissolve a variety of lignocellulosic substrates (Kuo and Lee 2009, Shafiei et al. 2010) without the need to chemically modify them and > 99 % of the solvent can be recovered due to its low vapor pressure (Perepelkin 2007). It is also nontoxic and biodegradable as proven by the work of Lenzing and other researchers (Rosenau et al. 2001). Further research is needed to evaluate and improve the economics of usage of ILs and NMMO for pretreatment of biomass. Pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials with acidified <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> (mixture of 80 % ethylene glycol, 19.5 % water and 0.5 % HCl at 178 °C for 90 min) has also been successfully used (Yamashita et al. 2010).The advantages of these methods include recovery and <b>recycling</b> of <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> as they can be easily distilled out. The disadvantages are that the process requires expensive high pressure equipment.

40|$|Excerpt] Introduction: Adsorption {{is defined}} as a {{spontaneous}} process during which one or more components of system concentrates on the interfacial region. Adsorption is, in most cases, a transient process, involving a solid and a fluid. The use of a solid is the main distinguishing feature from other processes such as absorption, distillation, or extraction. Solids are able to adsorb only traces of solute, therefore making this method useful for dilute solutions. The adsorbed solute, the adsorbate, does not dissolve into the solid; it stays on its surface or inside the pores. The process of adsorption is mostly reversible, and changes in pressure or temperature can easily provoke the removal of that solute from the solid. Adsorption has been used by the chemical and food industries for quite some time, and is taking its place in the purification and isolation of biocompounds in the pharmaceutical and fine-chemistry areas. The applications of adsorption in the food industry removal of color, odor, and other compounds that are a negative influence on the sensory characteristics of foods, such as liquid and crystal sugars, alcoholic drinks, fruit juices, fats and edible oils, among others; industrial purification of air and other gases, wastewater <b>recycling,</b> and <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> recovery; separation and purification of high-added-value products, such as various acids, vitamins, enzymes, and proteins (e. g., cheese whey proteins).

40|$|The {{application}} of water washing technology for <b>recycling</b> an <b>organic</b> composite <b>solvent</b> consisting of hexane and pentane (4 : 1; TU-A solvent) was investigated for extracting total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) from contaminated soil. The effects of water volume, water temperature, washing time and initial concentration of solvent were evaluated using orthogonal experiments followed by single factor experiments. Our {{results showed that}} the water volume was a statistically significant factor influencing greatly the water washing efficiency. Although less important, the other three factors have all increased the efficacy of water washing treatment. Based on a treatment of 20 g of contaminated soil with a TPH concentration of 140 mgg(- 1), optimal conditions were found to be at 40 °C, 100 mL water, 5 min washing time and 660 mgg(- 1) solvent. Semi-continuous water extraction method showed that the concentration of the composite solvent TU-A was reduced below 15 mgg(- 1) d. w. soil with a recovery extraction efficiency > 97 %. This finding suggests that water washing is a promising technology for recycling solvent used in TPH extraction from contaminated soil...|$|R

As the amount of <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> is increased, the number of TFSI- around Li+ rapidly decreases showing a higher affinity of the <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> to solvate Li+. The changes in the local configurations are also reflected in the ionic conductivity and the phase behaviour. The formation of larger clusters leads to a decrease in the conductivity, whereas the presence of several different clusters at intermediate compositions effectively hinders crystallization at low temperatures. The result is an enhanced low-temperature ionic conductivity in comparison with the pure IL or <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> electrolytes...|$|R

The expression levels of AcrA and AcrB proteins in JA 300 acrR IS were similar to, or slightly higher than, the levels in JA 300 marR. However, the extent of improvement in <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> tolerance in JA 300 acrR IS was lower than that in JA 300 marR because the disruption of acrR did not influence the expression level of TolC. JA 300 acrR IS marR and CH 7 equally enhanced the expression levels of AcrAB and TolC compared to JA 300 acrR IS and JA 300 marR. In addition, the intracellular solvent levels of JA 300 acrR IS marR and CH 7 were similarly kept lower than those of JA 300 acrR IS, JA 300 marR, and JA 300. These results suggested that the improved <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> tolerance in JA 300 acrR IS marR and CH 7 was a result of enhanced solvent-efflux activity by the overexpressed AcrAB-TolC pump. To clarify the contribution of the AcrAB-TolC pump to <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> tolerance in JA 300 acrR IS marR, an acrA-disruptant (JA 300 ΔacrA acrR IS marR) was constructed and its <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> tolerance was compared to that of JA 300 ΔacrA (Figure 3). JA 300 ΔacrA acrR IS marR became as sensitive to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> as JA 300 ΔacrA.

During the study, married women who were working in the factory laboratory units and were exposed to mixed <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> were compared with married women who were working in the packing units of the factory without occupational exposure to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents.</b> Frequency of spontaneous abortion and duration of pregnancy were assessed in both two groups. Collected data were analyzed with the SPSS software using t-test, logistic regression, and chi-square test. Results: In the present study, the frequency of spontaneous abortion in employees with exposure to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> mixture was 10. 7 %. This study showed that even after adjustment for confounding factors, there was a significant correlation between spontaneous abortion and occupational exposure to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> mixture and this correlation increased with increasing levels of exposure to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents.</b> Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between occupational exposure to mixed <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> and waiting time to become pregnant (TTP).

We offer a polyisoprene-nanostructured carbon composite (PNCC) us a promising material for <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour detection and identification in the environment. Previously obtained experimental results verify that PNCC can distinguish 10 different <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> saturated vapour. When PNCC is exposed to <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour, molecules of vapour adsorbe {{on the surface of the}} composite and diffuse into matrix material. At the same time decreases the tunnelling currents between carbon aggregates in thin layers of matrix and the electrical resistance of the composite increases. In the presence of <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> vapour electric resistance changes remarkably in short time (30 s) and the effect is reversible. The largest electric resistance change velocity (vR) is observed for tetrahydrofuran (0, 19404 KΩ/min), benzene (0, 13082 KΩ/min) and ethylacetate (0, 10694 KΩ/min) vapour. But nearly no vR change is observed, when PNCC is exposed to propanol vapour (0, 004028 KΩ/min).
