50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th Century, {{hybridization}} {{became a}} popular avenue of research for stopping the phylloxera louse.

Therefore, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>phylloxera</b> was the primary criterion for selection of rootstocks for grapevine. Soon after planting the first rootstocks, other problems arose, such as ferric chlorosis induced by excess of calcium present in many calcareous soils of Europe. This led to new breeding programs researches, especially in Europe. aiming to produce chlorosis resistant rootstocks, which was achieved by performing crosses with American species resistant to chlorosis, as Vitis berlandieri. Thus, wild species of American vines formed the genetic basis of most rootstocks used today worldwide. Those rootstocks developed were adapted to specific soil conditions and aimed to solve the existing problems in each viticulture region. Reynolds and Wardle (2001) outlined seven rnain criteria for choosing rootstocks in order of ímportance as phylloxera resistance, nematode resistance, adaptability to high pH soils, adaptability to saline soils, adaptability to soils with low pH, adaptability to waterlogged or poorly drained soils and adaptability to drought. Numerous studies have also shown that rootstocks affect agronomic and physiological characteristics of vines such as vigor, yield, size of bunches and berries, allocationof assimilates, sugar content and acidity of fruits and other important attributes of quality of grapes and wines. However, lhe choice of rootstock depends on the soil and environmental conditions of each region and within a region may undergo many varíations, which makes {{this is a difficult}} choice and local research work must be carried out for each growing grape region. In Brazil, research results were obtained in different grape cultivars and growing regions within the country. In general, tropical rootstocks developed by Instituto Agronômico de Campinas Breeding Programme, in São Paulo State named IAC 313 'Tropical', IAC 572 'Jales' and IAC 766 'Campinas' have shown good performance and vigor when grafted in different cultivars. In São Francisco Valley, nematode tolerant rootstocks and moderate vigor such as 'Harmony', 'S 04 ' and 'Paulsen 1103 ' resulted in better balance between vegetative and reproductive growth and bunches with higher weight, better coloring and general appearance for 'Crimson Seedless', 'Sugraone' and 'Thompson Seedless' table grapes (Leão; Borges, 2011; Leão et aI.; 2011; Leão et ai., 2010). New studies have been performed to evaluate rootstocks for new table grape cultivars BRS Vitoria, BRS lsls and BRS Nubia recently released by Embrapa. In conclusion, the rootstocks use ín tropical viticulture has shown a great importance as a way to prevent soil diseases and pests and to control abiotic stresses, although the responses are specífic for each grape cultivar and environment.

40|$|Grapevine {{represents}} one of the major economic crop species on a worldwide scale, with a world production approaching 70 million of tons and a harvest area of over 7 million hectares. Amongst the 60 species within the Vitis genus, Vitis vinifera L. is the mostly used for the production of wine and distilled liquors. Before the devastation of European viticulture caused by of the introduction of phylloxera from North America, varieties of V. vinifera used commercially for wine production in Europe were traditionally grown on their own roots. Subsequently, the use of rootstocks from the pest’s origin was introduced to provide resistance to this and other deleterious diseases and to save the fate of European viticulture. Rootstocks have been bred from a number of Vitis species, especially V. berlandieri, V. riparia, and V. rupestris, and are known, in addition to the enhanced <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>phylloxera</b> and other pathogens, confer tolerance to abiotic stresses (e. g. drought, high salinity and Fe-deficiency), regulate the size of the scion, affected fruit development/ripening, contribute to fruit quality and can alter specific aspects of postharvest fruit quality of a scion. Results presented in this Ph. D thesis are a part of a larger multi-disciplinary project called SERRES (Selection of new grape rootstocks resistant to abiotic stresses through the development and validation of molecular markers) granted by Ager foundation. Selection of resistant rootstocks is crucial for the development of sustainable agricultural models and, at the same time, for inducing a balanced vegetative/productive ratio, a different ripening progression in grape berries and, as well as, differences in their global quality. Improving the knowledge about the molecular, biochemical and physiological bases of stress resistance is an absolute requirement for the selection of genotypes able to cope with stress conditions without any negative consequences on the vegetative growth and production of high quality grape. Drought has an enormous impact on crop production, indeed, {{it is one of the}} major factors limiting plant productivity and cause a severe yield reduction. Based on the global climate models, which predict an increase in the aridity in the next future, water deficit may became the major limiting factor. In this context rootstocks may play an important role in limiting crop loss by improving water use efficiency, potential for survival, growth capacity and scion adaptability to stress conditions. Water deficit leads to many morphological and physiological changes across a range of spatial and temporal scales, including reduced expansion of aerial organs, maintenance of root growth, decrease in transpiration and photosynthesis, accumulation of osmotic compounds and ions, activation of detoxifying processes and, in parallel, the transcriptional regulation of a large number of genes. Oxidative stress is related to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, such as H 2 O 2, O 2 -, -OH, 1 O 2, and NO. These ROS are responsible for most of the oxidative damages in biological systems and cellular components. Thus, a strict control of ROS levels, throughout the expression of genes coding for superoxide dismutases (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione peroxidise ROS scavenging enzymes, is mandatory for plant survival and the cross-talk between ROS accumulation and redox state is integrating part of a fine homeostasis control that plays a pivotal role in the plant response to stresses. Recently, a biochemical and physiological study of the M 4 [(V. vinifera x V. berlandieri) x V. berlandieri x cv Resseguier n. 1] novel candidate genotype to be used as rootstock in grapevine was performed. This genotype, established from 1985 by the DiSAA research group operating at the Milan University, was selected for its high tolerance to water deficit (WS) and salt exposure (SS). In comparison with the 101. 14 commercial genotype, M 4 un-grafted plants subjected to water and salt stress showed a greater capacity to tolerate WS and SS maintaining photosynthetic activity also under severe stress conditions and accumulating, especially at the root level, osmotic compounds and ions. In the first part of this thesis were reported results obtained from a large scale whole transcriptome analyses (RNA-seq) performed on root (whole apparatus) and leaf tissues of 101. 14 (drought susceptible) and M 4 plants sampled in progressive drought (five time points). Physiological analyses were performed on treated (water-stress, WS) and control (well-watered, WW) plants over all the sampling. The multifactorial analysis, which was performed on mRNA -seq data concerning to both the analyzed tissues (leaf and root), allowed us to evaluate the relative weight of the genotype (R: 101. 14 and M 4), of the type of stress imposed (Treatment, T: WW and WS) and of the time point considered (P: T 1 -T 4), and to identify Differentially expressed Genes (DEGs) that are affected in a specific way or the combined action of these factors (R:T, R:P, T:P and R:T:P). In WS root dataset, all considered components (R, T and P) were found to affect the higher number of genes in comparison to other dataset (WS leaf). A first general observation comparing results of the multifactorial analyses performed on leaves and roots is that in root tissue the “treatment” seems to be the main variable explaining differential gene expression depend on the kind treatment imposed, whereas in leaf tissue the weight of the genotype (rootstock) appear to be the highest. This observation is not surprising, considering that the root system is the first organ perceiving the water deprivation stress and the main one actively responding to it. In this case it’s clear the kind of treatment imposed represent the main variable influencing expression whereas the effect of the genotype is less determinant on differential expression of genes. RNA-seq data were used to performed a Differential Cluster Analysis (DCA), which is based upon comparison of correlation between genes expression of a “reference” and a “target” organism and allowed us to identify conserved and diverged co-expression patterns between related organisms. This analysis allowed us to compared the transcriptomic responses of M 4 and 101. 14 rootstocks. As concerns plant hormones, it was showed an induction of auxin, JAs and GAs related-genes at the beginning of the stress kinetic in M 4 stressed roots, whereas a up-regulation of these transcripts in unstressed root was observed in 101. 14. The most interesting metabolic category was the “Secondary metabolism” one because several DEGs belonging to these metabolisms were founded in both root and leaf upon WS, but with a strong specificity of DEGs expression among two considered organs. Indeed, upon WS, roots and leaves of the tolerant genotype M 4 exhibit an higher induction of stilbenes (i. e. STS) and flavonoids (e. g. CHS, F 3 H, LDOX, FLS) biosynthetic genes, respectively. We hypothesized the role of these genes in the control and balance ROS levels, in addition to the others well known ROS scavengers. In presence of water stress, M 4 rootstock may acts differential mechanisms in root and leaves which leads to the production of molecules, such as resveratrol and flavonoids and these events may be related to a secondary antioxidant system in this rootstock. The higher resistance of M 4 rootstock to water stress, in comparison to what observed in 101. 14, should be related to these events. In the second part, in order to evaluate the effects of the rootstocks on grape berry quality and development/ripening, an RNA-seq experiment on Cabernet Sauvignon (CS) grafted onto M 4 and 1103 Paulsen rootstocks was carried out. Whole berries were collected from CS/ 1103 P and CS/M 4 bunches at 45, 59, 65 days after full bloom (DAFB), in correspondence to the end of lag phase. At this moment most of grape berries reached véraison, the other samples (separating skin and pulp) were collected at 72, 86 and 100 DAFB. On the basis of physical (volume and colour) and chemical (Soluble Solids Concentration, SSC) parameters, the two rootstocks seem to induce a different development and ripening pattern on CS berries. To identify the same developmental phases of berries collected from CS/ 1103 P and CS/M 4, the expression profile of genes involved in phenols, sugar and organic acids metabolisms were overlapped. This approach allowed to establish that the green phase occurred at 45 DAFB in both combinations, while véraison happened at 72 and 86 DAFB for CS/M 4 and CS/ 1103 P, respectively. An mRNA-seq and a microRNA-seq experiments were carried out on CS berries sampled at pre-véraison (45 DAFB), véraison (72 and 86 DAFB for M 4 and 1103 P, respectively) and traditional CS vintage date (100 DAFB). For the statistical analyses on RNA-seq data a pairwise comparisons between M 4 and 1103 P genotypes were accomplished at each time point and a large numbers of DEGs related to auxin metabolisms were identified with enrichment and clustering analysis. It is well known the important role of auxins on grape berry development, so, it was decided to focus our attention on this hormone and to performed a characterization of grape ARF and AUX/IAA gene families. Indeed, in another work presented in this thesis, we showed that an NAA treatment just before véraison caused delayed grape berry ripening at the transcriptional and physiological level, along with the recovery of a steady state of its intracellular concentration. Hormone indices analysis carried out with the HORMONOMETER tool suggests that biologically active concentrations of auxins were achieved throughout a homeostatic recovery. This occurred within 7 days after the treatment, during which the physiological response was mainly unspecific and due to a likely pharmacological effect of NAA. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the up-regulation of genes involved in auxin conjugation (GH 3 -like) and action (IAA 4 - and IAA 31 -like). Considering these results, the differences observed among CS/M 4 and CS/ 1103 P in grape berry development and ripening should be related to a different regulation of auxin metabolism. Indeed, all transcripts/miRNAs analyses performed (RNA-seq, microRNA-seq and qPCR) highlighted important differences in the auxin metabolism among the two scion/rootstock combination. Our data suggest an important involvement in the control of grape berry development/ripening of genes that are related, on one hand to auxin action (ARF and AUX/IAA) and, on the other hand, to homeostasis of this hormone through the expression of genes involved in conjugation (GH 3) and transport (PIN and ABCB). In this context, also miRNA have an important role, especially by controlling ARF–related genes (e. g. miR 160 and miR 167). In the case of fruit ripening, auxin acted as a positive regulator of genes that control grape berry size (e. g. expansin-related genes) before the véraison stage; it was indeed observed the up-regulation at the pre-véraison stage, which was different for CS/M 4 and CS/ 1103 P, of transcripts that control auxin-responsive genes (e. g. VvARF 8 A and VvARF 1 A). The induction of genes that belonged to ARF family was paralleled by the expression of transcripts that control auxin level(e. g. VvGH 3 - 1) and action (VvIAA 9, VvIAA 15 A, VvIAA 16), suggesting that an accurate regulation of auxin homeostasis in grape berries at these phases. Moreover, control of auxin levels in grape berry seems pass through other mechanisms which involved control of transport-related genes in the early (ABCBs) and late (PINs) phases of berry development. Taking into accounts that at commercial CS harvest, CS/M 4 berries berries were showing differences in some processes ripening-related (e. g. flavonoids metabolism) and a different regulation of auxin metabolisms, when compared to those of CS/ 1103 P, auxin seems to act as negative regulators on some genes related to grape berry ripening but its induction at the pre-véraison stage could be necessary to triggers other metabolism involved in ripening processes...|$|E

50|$|The only European grapes {{that are}} {{natively}} resistant <b>to</b> <b>phylloxera</b> are the Assyrtiko grape which grows on the volcanic island of Santorini, Greece, {{although it is}} not clear whether the <b>resistance</b> is due <b>to</b> the rootstock itself or the volcanic ash on which it grows; and the Juan Garcia grape variety, autochthonous to the medieval village of Fermoselle in Spain. The Juan Garcia variety remained—untouched by phylloxera—sheltered on the vineyards planted on the man-made land terraces along the mountainous skirts on the gigantic and steep Arribes River Canyon, where the microclimatic conditions discourage the growth of phylloxera.|$|R

50|$|Millardet is chiefly {{remembered for}} his work dealing with plant pests. In the 1860s the {{vineyards}} of France were infested by the destructive Phylloxera, an aphid-like pest inadvertently introduced to Europe from the United States. Millardet and fellow botanist Jules Émile Planchon (1823-1888) controlled the infestation by using American grape vines that were resistant <b>to</b> <b>Phylloxera</b> as grafting stock.|$|R
