40|$|Topological methods, {{including}} persistent homology, {{are powerful}} tools {{for analysis of}} high-dimensional data sets but these methods rely almost exclusively on thresholding techniques. In noisy data sets, thresholding does not always allow for the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> topological <b>information.</b> We present an easy to implement, computationally efficient pre-processing algorithm to prepare noisy point cloud data sets for topological data analysis. The topological de-noising algorithm allows for the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> topological infor-mation that is inaccessible by thresholding methods. We apply the algorithm to synthetically-generated noisy data sets and show the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> topological <b>information</b> which is impossible to obtain by thresh-olding. We also apply the algorithm to natural image data in R 8 and show a very clean <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> topolog-ical <b>information</b> previously only available with large amounts of thresholding.

AC is the form of electric power most commonly delivered to businesses and residences. The usual waveform of an AC power circuit is a sine wave.

Strikingly, this mathematics can generate patterns of amazing complexity, but it also has the power to generate seemingly natural or organic shapes that defeat Newtonian geometry. The promise, then, (however questionable it is in reality) is that information, and by extension, nature itself, can overcome the tendency to increase in entropy".|$|E

This “open-minded and broadly anthropological perspective on the past shaped the nature of archaeological research in Florida”.

40|$|SUMMARY. The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the estimation problem for a proper block design with <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> inter-block <b>information</b> for which numerous procedures are available in the literature with very little known about their relative merits. A desirable property, termed here as goodness, of any such procedure is the natural requirement that it should not, under any circumstances, lead to loss of efficiency compared to the usual procedure without <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> inter-block <b>information.</b> So far, this has been theoretically investigated only {{in the case of the}} Yates-Rao procedure and yielded fragmentary results. The purpose of the present paper is to supercede these results by providing the necessary and sufficient condition for goodness of the Yates-Rao procedure in the case of any proper block design excluding the rare cases where the application of the procedure without truncation of the estimated variance ratio can give rise to a negative weight for the inter-block estimator. 1...|$|R

40|$|We combine two Gaussianization {{techniques}} - Wavelet Non-Linear Wiener Filter (WNLWF) {{and density}} reconstruction - {{to quantify the}} <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> Fisher <b>information</b> that is lost in the gravitational collapse. We compute a displacement fields, in analogy with the Zel'dovich approximation, and apply a Wavelet Non-Linear Wiener Filter that decomposes the reconstructed density fields into a Gaussian and a non-Gaussian component. From a series of 200 realizations of N-body simulations, we compute the recovery performance for density fields obtained with both dark matter particles and haloes. We find that the height <b>of</b> the Fisher <b>information</b> trans-linear plateau is {{increased by more than}} an order of magnitude at k > 1. 0 h/Mpc for particles, whereas either technique alone offers an individual <b>recovery</b> boost <b>of</b> only a factor of three to five.

When applied to the halo catalogues, we find that the reconstruction has only a weak effect on the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> Fisher <b>Information,</b> while the non-linear wavelet filter boosts the information by about a factor offive.
