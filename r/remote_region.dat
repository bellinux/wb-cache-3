5|$|Sangay can and {{has been}} climbed. It was first ascended in 1929 by Robert T. Moore, prior to its current {{eruption}} beginning in 1934. However, the volcano's current active state presents dangers to mountaineers {{in the form of}} falling ejecta; in 1976, two members of an expedition on the volcano were struck and killed by falling debris. In addition, the volcano is located in a <b>remote</b> <b>region</b> with poor roads and is difficult to access, and periods of heavy rainfall can flood rivers and cause landslides, rendering the mountain routes impassable. Nonetheless, the Instituto Ecuatoriano Forestal y de Areas Naturales, which maintains an office near the mountain, facilitate such activities by providing local guides and rooms for rent to visitors. Ascension takes between 7 and 10 days from Quito. Conditions on the volcano are usually very wet and foggy, which may impair visibility significantly during the ascent.|$|E

5|$|The {{events of}} the Klondike Gold Rush {{challenged}} this policy, as the force soon became essential to controlling the borders in the far north. Moving the entire force to the <b>remote</b> <b>region</b> of the Yukon, though, would {{have more than doubled}} the cost of the police's training and support arrangements, and their existing bases therefore remained vital to the northern operations. The increasing demands from the railway companies and mining companies for police assistance, and appeals from the ranching community for continued support, also made it harder for the Liberals to consider cutting back the force. The Second Boer War then disrupted plans to create a replacement militia unit, while Herchmer's disastrous tour in South Africa enabled the Liberals to replace him with Perry, a Liberal supporter. As a result, the political argument began to swing back in favour of potentially retaining the force.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{volcanic}} {{zones in}} the Garibaldi Belt, volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field are not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma systems are. This {{is partly because}} the field {{is located in a}} <b>remote</b> <b>region</b> and no major eruptions have occurred in Canada in the last few hundred years. As a result, volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other natural processes, including tsunamis, earthquakes and landslides. However, with the existence of earthquakes, further volcanism is expected and would probably have considerable effects, particularly in a region like southwestern British Columbia where the Garibaldi Belt is located in a highly populated area. Because of these concerns, significant support from Canadian university scientists have resulted in the construction of a baseline of knowledge {{on the state of the}} Garibaldi volcanoes. This improvement is continuous and will support the understanding to monitor volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field for future volcanism.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} coronary vasodilator reserve and metabolism in myocardium subtended by angiographically normal arteries remote from ischemia. Background. After infarction, structural and functional changes occur in remote myocardium often subtended by normal arteries. Whether changes occur in <b>regions</b> <b>remote</b> from ischemic but noninfarcted myocardium is unknown. Methods. Coronary vasodilator reserve was measured with positron emission tomography in 12 patients with single-vessel disease using intravenous dipyridamole (0. 56 mg/kg for 4 min). In another 10 patients, simultaneous arterial/great cardiac vein catheterization was performed during atrial pacing to measure myocardial metabolism in regions subtended by diseased or normal arteries. Results. Basal myocardial blood flow in stenosis-related regions was comparable to that in <b>remote</b> <b>regions</b> but was lower after dipyridamole administration (1. 73 ± 0. 91 vs. 2. 89 ± 0. 93 ml/min per g, p < 0. 01), giving coronary vasodilator reserve values of 1. 80 ± 0. 82 and 2. 73 ± 0. 89 (p < 0. 01). In normal control subjects, basal myocardial blood flow was 0. 92 ± 0. 13 and 3. 67 ± 0. 94 ml/min per g in the basal state and after dipyridamole (both p < 0. 05 vs. values in <b>remote</b> <b>regions),</b> and coronary vasodilator reserve was 4. 07 ± 0. 98 (p < 0. 01 vs. values in <b>remote</b> <b>regions).</b> During pacing there was net lactate release in diseased regions (− 18 ± 27 %, p < 0. 05 vs. values in <b>remote</b> <b>regions</b> and control subjects) and extraction in <b>remote</b> <b>regions</b> (38 ± 17 %) and in normal control subjects (26 ± 11 %). Glucose and alanine extraction were increased in diseased (8 ± 6 % and 6 ± 6 %) and <b>remote</b> <b>regions</b> (6 ± 3 % and 4 ± 3 %), compared with values in normal control subjects (2 ± 3 % and − 1 ± 3 %, both p < 0. 05 vs. diseased and <b>remote</b> <b>regions).</b> Conclusions. Coronary vasodilator reserve is reduced and glucose and alanine metabolism is abnormal in regions subtended by normal arteries remote from ischemic but noninfarcted myocardium...|$|R

Smith then decided to change the setting to 1000 years in the future, which imposed a higher budget. The film was also intended to be the first in a trilogy. Smith had his production company Overbrook contact Gary Whitta (who was then known for his script for The Book of Eli) with a simple log line for a film: a father and son crash landed on Earth 1000 years after it had been abandoned by humankind. Impressed with his idea and excited about the opportunity to work with him, Whitta fleshed out Smith's idea and pitched it to him, subsequently becoming the first employee on the project.|$|E
25|$|Some Yemenite Jews {{stayed behind}} during Operation Magic Carpet, and were left behind, {{many of them}} not wanting to leave sick or elderly {{relatives}} behind. Another wave of emigration took place in 1959, with some 3,000 Yemenite Jews moving to Israel, and some others moving to the United States and United Kingdom. Those Jews that remained behind were forbidden from emigrating, and were banned from contacting relatives abroad. They were isolated and scattered throughout the mountainous regions of northern Yemen, and suffered shortages of food, clothing, and medicine, and lacked religious articles. As a result, some converted to Islam. Their existence was unknown until 1976, when an American diplomat stumbled across a small Jewish community in a <b>remote</b> <b>region</b> of northern Yemen. For a short time afterward, Jewish organizations were allowed to travel openly in Yemen, distributing Hebrew books and materials. From August 1992 to July 17, 1993, Jews numbering some 246 persons came up to Israel from Yemen, via Germany, and some via the United-States.|$|E
25|$|Cricket {{was first}} {{introduced}} into Bengal by the British East India Company in the 18th century and the first cricket matches recorded were in Calcutta in 1792, but matches were possibly played {{more than a decade}} earlier and the sport quickly achieved popularity in western Bengal and neighbouring Bihar. In eastern Bengal, the area which is now Bangladesh, cricket developed very slowly as the area failed to attract large numbers of European settlers until {{the second half of the}} 19th century. The problems were the region's predominantly rural character and its lack of infrastructure given that it had numerous rivers and travel was extremely difficult. The confluence of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra is in central Bangladesh and the coastal area consists of the Sundarbans mangrove forest and the Ganges Delta. The British saw it as a <b>remote</b> <b>region</b> with few economic incentives. Improvement was gradual and it was not until the 1860s and 1870s that the British built the new roads that facilitated communication. Work was done to improve water supplies, with a consequent boost to public health, and Europeans began to settle in Dhaka with cricket soon becoming one of their favourite recreational activities, as had happened elsewhere in India. In 1876, a European XI met and defeated a Native XVIII in Dhaka.|$|E

In explaining the strange context of the crime, Ngô Sĩ Liên revealed that Lê Văn Thịnh learned the sorcery from his Dali servant {{with the purpose of}} overthrowing Lý Nhân Tông. Although the crime of killing the emperor and usurping the throne was considered the most serious crime in the system of rules of the Lý Dynasty, Lý Nhân Tông, holding a high regard for Lê Văn Thịnh's achievement in the royal court, only banished the former chancellor to the <b>remote</b> <b>region</b> of Thao Giang (now Cẩm Khê, Phú Thọ) where he died in 1096. The decision of Lý Nhân Tông was criticized by Ngô Sĩ Liên who reasoned that the graciousness of the emperor might spring from his devotion to Buddhism. In Đại Việt sử lược, an historical book which was compiled before Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư and considered the earliest surviving historical source of Đại Việt, this event was recited almost identically as Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư except for the odd element of Lê Văn Thịnh transforming into a tiger. This element was also excluded from the Từ điển bách khoa toàn thư Việt Nam, which noted that Lê Văn Thịnh was exiled to Thao Giang because the emperor suspected that his chancellor might have a conspiracy to overthrow him. According to folk legend, Lê Văn Thịnh spent his last days in Đình Tổ village (now Thuận Thành, Bắc Ninh) where the likely site of his grave still remains.|$|E
25|$|The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt {{in southwestern}} British Columbia is the {{northern}} {{extension of the}} Cascade Volcanic Arc in the United States and contains the most explosive young volcanoes in Canada. Like {{the rest of the}} arc, it has its origins in the Cascadia subduction zone. Volcanoes of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt have been sporadically active over a time span of several millions of years. The northernmost member, Mount Meager, was responsible for a major catastrophic eruption that occurred about 2,350 years ago. This eruption may have been close in size to that of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Ash from this eruption can be traced eastward to western Alberta. It is also the most unstable volcanic massive in Canada, which has dumped clay and rock several meters deep into the Pemberton Valley at least three times during the past 7,300 years. Hot springs in the vicinity of Mount Cayley and Mount Meager suggest that magmatic heat is still present. The long history of volcanism in the region, coupled with continued subduction off the coast, suggests that volcanism has not yet ended in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. A few isolated volcanic centers northwest of Mount Meager such as the Franklin Glacier Volcano and the Silverthrone Caldera, which lie in the Pemberton Volcanic Belt, may also be the product of Cascadia subduction, but geologic investigations have been very limited in this <b>remote</b> <b>region.</b> About 5–7 million years ago, the northern end of the Juan de Fuca Plate broke off along the Nootka Fault to form the Explorer Plate, and there is no definitive consensus among geologists on the relation of the volcanoes north of that fault {{to the rest of the}} Cascade Arc. However, the Pemberton Volcanic Belt is usually merged with the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, making Mount Silverthrone the northernmost, but an uncertain Cascadia subduction-related volcano.|$|E
