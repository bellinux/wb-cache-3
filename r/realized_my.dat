500|$|Goldstein was {{struggling}} with his former addiction during the filming of Gone Too Far. He held a crack-pipe during one episode. BJ Hickman, an intervention expert who appeared in two episodes, noticed Goldstein [...] "had a moment" [...] holding the crack pipe, and later {{felt the need to}} call his sponsor. Goldstein later said of the experience: [...] "I <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> palms were sweaty and I was like, wait a minute, this is not smart for me to be holding this." [...] In another episode, a police officer shows Goldstein confiscated drugs, including a bag of crack cocaine. Shortly thereafter, Goldstein leaves the building, informing the camera crew that he felt so tempted to consume the drugs that it was not safe for him to remain there.|$|E
2500|$|Rachel Coleman as Rachel, {{the host}} of the Signing Time! series. She has spent much of her adult life in the {{entertainment}} industry. While performing with her band We the Living, Rachel’s 14-month-old daughter Leah, was diagnosed as having a profound hearing impairment. [...] “When I <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> daughter was deaf, I could not find a way to rationalize spending hours working on my music. My priorities changed. I put down my guitar and picked up sign language.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1825, Brownlow {{attended}} a camp meeting near Sulphur Springs, Virginia, where he experienced a dramatic spiritual rebirth. [...] He later recalled that, suddenly, [...] "all my anxieties were at an end, all my hopes were <b>realized,</b> <b>my</b> happiness was complete." [...] He immediately abandoned the carpentry trade and began studying {{to become a}} Methodist minister. [...] In Fall 1826, he attended {{the annual meeting of}} the Holston Conference of the Methodist Church in Abingdon. [...] He applied to join the travelling ministry (commonly called [...] "circuit riders"), and was admitted that year by Bishop Joshua Soule.|$|E

2500|$|Hathaway {{was raised}} as Roman Catholic {{with what she}} {{considers}} [...] "really strong values", and stated that she wished to be a nun during her childhood: [...] "When I was 11, I felt like I got a calling from God to be a nun." [...] At the age of fifteen, her relationship with the Catholic Church changed, after learning that Michael was gay. She said: [...] "I <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> older brother was gay, and I couldn't support a religion that didn't support my brother. Now I call myself a non-denominational Christian, because I haven't found the religion for me." [...] The year prior, in 2009, she stated that her religious beliefs are [...] "a work in progress".|$|E
2500|$|However, Ellis, {{releasing}} a letter Monday evening {{that he sent}} Saturday to county Chief Operating Officer Robert W. Graf, denies violating the agreement. The letter, in part, states: [...] "As for Ms. Bradley and myself, that case was amicably closed April 1 and never violated by either party. As I told Ms. Jackson, I did mistakenly dial Ms. Bradley on her cell when trying to call someone with a very close number and I dialed too quickly...after four years, {{it was an old}} habit. Nothing was said and I immediately hung up when I <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> mistake. That happened one time in a month. I have said nothing to Ms. Bradley nor seen her in or out of the county workplace." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the {{handsome}} {{son of a}} millionaire {{and one of the}} most famous athletes in the United States, Shevlin's courting of, and engagement to, Elizabeth Sherley was the subject of extensive press coverage. [...] Sherley was reported to be one of the most beautiful young women in the South and the daughter of one of the wealthiest families of Louisville, Kentucky. [...] Shevlin met the 17-year-old Sherley in 1905, and she attended all of Yale's football games in the fall of 1905. [...] The press covered the courtship with articles bearing headlines such as, [...] "Tom Shevlin Is Downed By Cupid." [...] Sherley was described as [...] "one of the prettiest girls who ever sat in a grandstand waving a blue banner and cheering a good play on the gridiron." [...] After beating Harvard in 1905, newspapers reported that Shevlin said to a teammate, [...] "I've <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> first ambition today, beating Harvard. [...] I've got one more -- to marry that pretty girl you see sitting there in that box." ...|$|E

60|$|So far I could advance toward <b>realizing</b> <b>my</b> position--and no further. When I {{asked myself}} {{what was to}} be done next, hopeless confusion, maddening doubt, filled my mind, and {{transformed}} me into the most listless and helpless of living women.|$|R
2500|$|Eggleston's early {{photographic}} {{efforts were}} inspired {{by the work of}} Swiss-born photographer Robert Frank, and by French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson's book, The Decisive Moment. Eggleston later recalled that the book was [...] "the first serious book I found, from many awful books...I didn't understand it a bit, and then it sank in, and I <b>realized,</b> <b>my</b> God, this is a great one.” First photographing in black-and-white, Eggleston began experimenting with color in 1965 and 1966 after being introduced to the medium by William Christenberry. [...] Color transparency film became his dominant medium in the later 1960s. Eggleston's development as a photographer seems to have taken place in relative isolation from other artists. In an interview with Director of Photography at New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) John Szarkowski describes his first encounter with the young Eggleston in 1969 as being [...] "absolutely out of the blue". After reviewing Eggleston's work (which he recalled as a suitcase full of [...] "drugstore" [...] color prints) Szarkowski prevailed upon the Photography Committee of MoMA to buy one of Eggleston's photographs.|$|E
60|$|September 10th.--After more delays than one, on {{land and}} sea, I was at last set ashore near the Tower, on the {{afternoon}} of yesterday. God help us, my worst anticipations have been <b>realized!</b> <b>My</b> beloved Felicia has urgent and serious need of me.|$|E
60|$|These {{were growing}} days!

6000|$|... "Instead {{of which}} I laid myself bare," [...] I cried bitterly, [...] "and {{at the same}} time was {{suspicious}} of that lad, Seth Jepson. Not until he admitted getting information concerning Archie from Amos Nelson, did I <b>realize</b> <b>my</b> mistake." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am very justly rebuked," [...] he admitted, {{holding her}} fingers for a moment, [...] "only you must {{remember}} that it is new {{for me to have}} so delightful a means of escape ready by my side. Give me a little time to <b>realize</b> <b>my</b> good fortune." ...|$|R
60|$|Even now I fail to {{understand}} why my wits had so completely deserted me. I had no thought {{of what might be}} the result if we two made off into the forest in the darkness; but before we met Simon Kenton again I <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> folly most keenly.|$|E
60|$|M. de la Feste came slowly back; as {{he stepped}} in beside me I <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> {{position}} so vividly that my heart might almost have been heard to beat. The third condition had arisen--the least expected by either of us. She had refused him; {{he was free to}} claim me.|$|E
60|$|Calling to Dejah Thoris to {{get behind}} me I worked my way toward the little doorway back of the throne, but the {{officers}} <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> intentions, and three of them sprang in behind me and blocked my chances for gaining a position where I could have defended Dejah Thoris against any army of swordsmen.|$|E

6000|$|Several of the agonized beasts {{had been}} in times of {{loneliness}} almost as human friends to me.

60|$|Then it was terrible. My intuition was right! For a moment, I thought, and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously {{looking for}} {{something}} or some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on the table.

6000|$|In {{the state}} of my mind at that moment, her {{perseverance}} conquered me.

[...] Before I could answer her she had <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> anticipations. She returned to the subject; and she made me say Yes.|$|E
5000|$|Fourteen actors won Oscars under Wyler's direction, {{including}} Bette Davis in Jezebel (1938) and her {{nomination for}} The Letter (1940).

60|$|Dejah Thoris {{would have}} none of me again on this evening, and though I spoke her name she neither replied, nor conceded by so much as the flutter of an eyelid that she <b>realized</b> <b>my</b> existence.

6000|$|... "They went up together, {{leaving me}} below. To my {{surprise}} and consternation, {{as they reached}} the top of the cellar stairs, I saw the General swing the door shut and heard a key turn in the lock.

60|$|Gratefully {{sinking into}} a chair by the window, I fell into study of the people {{streaming}} by, and a chilling sense of helplessness fell upon me.

The Boston trip seemed a foolish tempting of Providence and yet, scared as I was, I had no real intention of giving it up.|$|E

5000|$|I <b>realize</b> <b>my</b> entire {{youth and}} early {{writings}} {{had all been}} nurtured in hatred, violence and arrogance, or lies, cynicism and sarcasm.
