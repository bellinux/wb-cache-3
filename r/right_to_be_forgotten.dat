Trevelyan not only protects Civilization and Science - {{abstract}} concepts which Murdoch, with little formal education though highly intelligent and resourceful, cannot really appreciate. Beyond that, Trevelyan acts out of a strong moral imperative to protect the dead sentients who cannot defend themselves. They have rights, too - the <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> or erased, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> have their voice heard and their culture and achievements known and remembered. In the name of this <b>right,</b> Trevelyan acts <b>to</b> quash Murdoch's grand design - feeling little joy but having no doubt about the righteousness of his act.|$|R
40|$|The {{digital era}} invoked new {{challenges}} to judicial systems. The Internet enabled {{violation of privacy}} and intellectual property rights and enhanced the magnitude of criminal activity. Recognizing the inability of courts to handle a high magnitude of lawsuits, along with enforcement difficulties, policymakers worldwide chose to delegate quasi-judicial powers to online intermediaries that facilitate or enable such potential violations or infringements of rights. Search engines <b>were</b> first tasked <b>to</b> perform a quasi-judicial role under a notice-and-takedown regime to combat copyright infringement around the world. Recently, the European Union (EU) decided to delegate judicial authority to search engines by granting rights of erasure, or delisting of personal data, about EU individuals under certain circumstances. Effectively, the EU placed search engines—mainly Google currently—as a judiciary, tasked to balance different fundamental human rights. This privatization of the judiciary represents a new paradigm in legal systems and possesses vast global ramifications, which must be further scrutinized. This Article provides such scrutiny. It begins by briefly exploring the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> and delisted. It then {{provides an overview of}} the quasi-judicial roles played by search engines prior to the new EU rights regime and compares them to their new judicial role. Following an examination of the pragmatic and normative difficulties in the implementation of the EU rights regime, this Article evaluates and discusses the future of the private judiciary. It examines the drawbacks and benefits of judicial privatization; explores whether other means of regulation are more appropriate; and proposes modest solutions to properly address the shortcomings of the new privatized judiciary. This Article warns against such form of privatization and its current implementation, especially when fundamental rights are at stake. If policymakers insist on adjudicating search engines, they must also restrain their judicial power and provide adequate safeguards for society in the form of transparency and proper oversight on both their removal procedure and decisions...|$|R

50|$|Major criticisms {{stem from}} {{the idea that the}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> would {{restrict}} the right to freedom of speech. Many nations, and the United States in particular (with the First Amendment to the United States Constitution), have very strong domestic freedom of speech law, which would be challenging to reconcile with the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten.</b> Some academics see that only a limited form of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> would be reconcilable with US constitutional law; the right of an individual to delete data that he or she has personally submitted. In this limited form of the right individuals could not have material removed that has been uploaded by others, as demanding the removal of information could constitute censorship and a reduction in the freedom of expression in many countries. Sandra Coliver of the Open Society Justice Initiative argues that not all rights must be compatible and this conflict between the two rights is not detrimental to the survival of either.|$|E
