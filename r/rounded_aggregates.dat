40|$|Bacterial biofilms {{are usually}} assumed to {{originate}} from individual cells deposited on a surface. However, many biofilm-forming bacteria tend to aggregate in the planktonic phase {{so that it}} is possible that many natural and infectious biofilms originate wholly or partially from pre-formed cell aggregates. Here, we use agent-based computer simulations to investigate the role of pre-formed aggregates in biofilm development. Focusing on the initial shape the aggregate forms on the surface, we find that the degree of spreading of an aggregate on a surface can {{play an important role in}} determining its eventual fate during biofilm development. Specifically, initially spread aggregates perform better when competition with surrounding unaggregated bacterial cells is low, while initially <b>rounded</b> <b>aggregates</b> perform better when competition with surrounding unaggregated cells is high. These contrasting outcomes are governed by a trade-off between aggregate surface area and height. Our results provide new insight into biofilm formation and development, and reveal new factors that may be at play in the social evolution of biofilm communities...|$|E

40|$|Behavior of {{rare earth}} {{elements}} (REE) was examined in oceanic phillipsites collected from four horizons of eupelagic clay in the Southwest Basin of the Pacific Ocean. REE concentrations were determined in > 50 ?m size fraction phillipsite samples by the ICP-MS method. Composition of separate phillipsite aggregates was studied by electron microprobe and secondary ion mass-spectrometry. Rare earth elements in phillipsite samples are related to admixture of ferrocalcium hydroxophosphates. Analysis of separate phillipsite aggregates reveals low (< 0. 1 - 18. 1 ppm) REE(III) concentrations. Ce concentration varies between 2. 7 and 140 ppm. The correlation analysis shows that REE(III) present in admixture of iron oxyhydroxides in separate phillipsite aggregates. Based on the REE(III) concentration in iron oxyhydroxides we can identify two generations of phillipsite aggregates. Massive <b>rounded</b> <b>aggregates</b> (phillipsite I) are depleted in REE, while pseudorhombic (phillipsite II) aggregates are enriched in REE and marked by a positive Ce anomaly. Oceanic phillipsites do not accumulate REE or inherit the REE signature of volcaniclastic material and oceanic deep water. Hence, REE distribution in phillipsites {{does not depend on}} sedimentation rate and composition of host sediments...|$|E
40|$|Trophoblast {{invasion}} of the uterine extracellular matrix, a critical process for human implantation and uteroplacental vascular development, is a striking example of controlled invasiveness. To examine cellular behavior relevant to this process, human trophoblasts were cultured on (i) Millicell filters prelayered with Matrigel and (ii) coverslips precoated with a gentle slope of Matrigel (Matribeach). Histologic sections of the Millicell system demonstrated significant invasion. However, on Matribeach the cells exhibited markedly different characteristics depending on {{the thickness of the}} Matrigel. On zone 1 (1 - 4 microns thick), flat aggregates and syncytia were seen. In contrast, cells on zone 2 (4 - 14 microns) formed <b>rounded</b> <b>aggregates</b> with intercellular processes. In this zone, prominent degradation of pericellular Matrigel proteins was assessed by both light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Treatment with 8 -bromo-cAMP inhibited this proteolytic process. On zone 3 (14 - 60 microns), unicellular trophoblasts or small aggregates caused minimal matrix degradation. JEG- 3 human choriocarcinoma cells exhibited similar morphologic and degradative properties on Matribeach, but zone 2 proteolysis was not affected by 8 -bromo-cAMP. Our results suggest that extracellular matrix thickness has profound effects on cellular morphology and proteolytic activity. Furthermore, while both normal and malignant human trophoblasts can degrade extracellular matrix proteins, only normal trophoblast extracellular matrix degradation is inhibited by 8 -bromo-cAMP...|$|E
40|$|Recognition and {{characterization}} of the different CM lithologies as components in all meteorites could reveal details {{of the nature and}} chronology of alteration and brecciation events on hydrous asteroids. The CM chondrites are of particular interest, as they are the most common carbonaceous chondrites and are found as clasts within other types of meteorites, which suggests that the CM parent asteroids are (or were) widespread in the sections of the asteroid belt providing samples to Earth. Some CM 2 s, including EET 90047, ALH 83100, and Y 82042, are more 'extensively' altered, and are distinguished by a high proportion of Mg-rich phyllosilicates and Ca-Mg carbonates, frequently in <b>rounded</b> <b>aggregates,</b> and near absence of olivine or pyroxene. 'Completely' altered CMs, called CM 1 s, essentially lack olivine or pyroxene; these include EET 83334, ALH 88045, and the CM 1 clasts in Kaidun. Cold Bokkeveld and EET 84034, both highly brecciated CMs, consist of both extensively and completely altered lithologies. We describe how these lithologies further cosntrain physicochemical conditions on hydrous asteroids. We conclude that CM chondrites exhibit the petrologic range 2 through 1, and that progressive alteration on the parent hydrous asteroid(s) was accompanied by significant increases in temperature (to a peak of approximately 450 C), fO 2, water-rock ratio, and (locally) degree of chemical leaching, all well beyond the conditions recorded by CM 2 s...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The sea {{ice cover}} of the Arctic Ocean has changed {{dramatically}} in the last decades, and the resulting consequences for the sea-ice-associated eco-system remain difficult to assess. Algal aggregates underneath sea ice are of great importance for the ice-associated ecosystem and the pelagic-benthic coupling. However, the frequency and distribution of their occur-rence is not well quantified. During the IceArc expedi-tion (ARK- 27 / 3) of RV Polarstern in late summer 2012, we observed different types of algal aggregates floating underneath various ice types in the Central Arctic basins. We investigated the spatial distribution of ice algal aggregates and quantified their biomass, using under-ice image surveys obtained by an upward-looking camera on a remotely operated vehicle. On basin scale, filamentous aggregates of Melosira arctica are more frequently found in the inner part of the Central Arctic pack ice, while <b>rounded</b> <b>aggregates</b> mainly formed by pennate diatoms are found closer to the ice edge, under melting sea ice. On the scale of an ice floe, the distribution of algal aggregates in late summer is mainly regulated by the topography of the ice underside, with aggregates accumulating in dome-shaped structures and {{at the edges of}} pressure ridges. The average biomass of the aggre-gates from our sites and season was 0. 1 – 6. 0 mg C m- 2. However, depending on the approach used, differences in orders of magnitude for biomass estimates may occur. This highlights the difficulties of upscaling observations and comparing results from surveys conducted using different methods or on different spatial scales...|$|E
40|$|Most {{particles}} breathed on rail subway platforms {{are highly}} ferruginous (FePM) and extremely small (nanometric {{to a few}} microns in size). High magnification observations of particle texture and chemistry on airborne PM 10 samples collected from the Barcelona Metro, combined with published experimental work on particle generation by frictional sliding, allow us to propose a general model to explain the origin of most subway FePM. Particle generation occurs by mechanical wear at the brake–wheel and wheel–rail interfaces, where magnetic metallic flakes and splinters are released and undergo progressive atmospheric oxidation from metallic iron to magnetite and maghemite. Flakes of magnetite typically comprise mottled mosaics of octahedral nanocrystals (10 – 20 nm) that become pseudomorphed by maghemite. Continued oxidation results in extensive alteration of the magnetic nanostructure to more <b>rounded</b> <b>aggregates</b> of non-magnetic hematite nanocrystals, with magnetic precursors (including iron metal) still preserved in some particle cores. Particles derived from steel wheel and rails contain a characteristic trace element chemistry, typically with Mn/Fe = 0. 01. Flakes released from brakes are chemically very distinctive, depending on the pad composition, being always carbonaceous, commonly barium-rich, and texturally inhomogeneous, with trace elements present in nanominerals incorporated within the crystalline structure. In the studied subway lines of Barcelona at least {{there appears to be}} only a minimal aerosol contribution from high temperature processes such as sparking. To date there is no strong evidence that these chemically and texturally complex inhalable metallic materials are any more or less toxic than street-level urban particles, and as with outdoor air, the priority in subway air quality should be to reduce high mass concentrations of aerosol present in some stations...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a new model of {{sporadic}} Parkinson disease (PD) based on silencing of the SKP 1 A gene, a component of the ubiquitin-proteasome/E 3 ligase complex, Skp 1, Cullin 1, F-box protein, which was found to be highly decreased in the substantia nigra of sporadic PD patients. Initially, an embryonic mouse substantia nigra-derived cell line (SN 4741 cells) was infected with short hairpin RNA lentiviruses encoding the murine transcript of the SKP 1 A gene or with scrambled vector. SKP 1 A silencing resulted in increased susceptibility to neuronal damages induced by the parkinsonism-inducing neurotoxin 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium ion and serum starvation, in parallel with a decline in the expression of the dopaminergic markers, dopamine transporter and vesicular monoamine transporter- 2. SKP 1 A-deficient cells presented a delay in completion of the cell cycle and the inability to arrest at the G 0 /G 1 phase when induced to differentiate. Instead, the cells progressed through S phase, developing <b>rounded</b> <b>aggregates</b> with characteristics of aggresomes including immunoreactivity for γ-tubulin, α-synuclein, ubiquitin, tyrosine hydroxylase, Hsc- 70 (70 -kDa heat shock cognate protein), and proteasome subunit, and culminating in a lethal phenotype. Conversely, stably enforced expression of wild type SKP 1 A duplicated the survival index of naïve SN 4741 cells under proteasomal inhibition injury, suggesting a new structural role of SKP 1 in dopaminergic neuronal function, besides its E 3 ligase activity. These results link, for the first time, SKP 1 to dopamine neuronal function and survival, suggesting an essential role in sporadic PD. In summary, this new model has reproduced to a significant extent the molecular alterations described in sporadic PD at the cellular level, implicating Skp 1 as a potential modifier in sporadic PD neurodegeneration...|$|E

40|$|A drapery speleothem (DRA- 1) from Castañar Cave in Spain was {{subjected}} to a detailed petrographical study {{in order to identify}} its primary and diagenetic features. The drapery’s present day characteristics are the result of the combined effects of the primary and diagenetic processes that DRA- 1 underwent. Its primary minerals are calcite, aragonite and huntite. Calcite is the main constituent of the speleothem, whereas aragonite forms as frostwork over the calcite. Huntite is the main mineral of moonmilk which covers the tips of aragonite. These primary minerals have undergone a set of diagenetic processes, which include: 1) partial dissolution or corrosion that produces the formation of powdery matt-white coatings {{on the surface of the}} speleothem. These are seen under the microscope as dark and highly porous microcrystalline aggregates; 2) total dissolution produces pores of few cm 2 in size; 3) calcitization and dolomitization of aragonite result in the thickening and lost of shine of the aragonite fibres. Microscopically, calcitization is seen as rhombohedral crystals which cover and replace aragonite forming mosaics that preserve relics of aragonite precursor. Dolomitization results in the formation of microcrystalline <b>rounded</b> <b>aggregates</b> over aragonite fibres. These aggregates are formed by dolomite crystals of around 1 μm size. The sequence of diagenetic processes follows two main pathways. Pathway 1 is driven by the increase of saturation degree and Mg/Ca ratio of the karstic waters and is visible in the NW side of the drapery. This sequence of processes includes: 1) aragonite and huntite primary precipitation and 2) dolomitization. Pathway 2 is driven by a decrease in the degree of saturation of calcite and aragonite and Mg/Ca ratio of the cave waters, and it is observed in the SE side of the drapery. The diagenetic processes of the second pathway include: 1) calcitization of aragonite; 2) incomplete dissolution (micritization) of both aragonite and calcite; 3) total dissolution. This study highlights the importance of diagenetic processes on speleothems and their complexity. The correct interpretation of these processes is crucial for the understanding of possible changes in the chemistry of waters, temperature, or pCO 2 and so is critical to the correct interpretation of the paleoenvironmental significance of speleothems.

40|$|Certain {{embryonic}} tissue {{masses and}} cell aggregates behave like deformable solids during brief experimental manipulations but like viscous liquids in long-term organ cultures. To investigate these seemingly paradoxical physical properties, we have mechanically deformed cell aggregates derived from several embryonic chick organs by centrifuging them against solid substrata. Aggregate shapes during brief centrifugation were observed directly in a microscope-centrifuge. In addition, techniques were devised for fixing cell aggregates during prolonged centrifugation. Evidence presented here shows that these fixative-injection procedures accu-rately preserve the prefixation shapes of living centrifuged aggregates. According {{to a simple}} viscous-liquid model for cell aggregates, cohering cells slide past one another when external forces and/or tissue surface tensions cause gradual rearrangements in aggregate conformations. In earlier experiments, 2 types of behaviour predicted from this model were confirmed for several embryonic chick tissues subjected to prolonged centrifugation. First, initially fiat <b>aggregates</b> <b>rounded</b> up against the centrifugal force to adopt the same shapes that initially <b>round</b> <b>aggregates</b> reached by flattening.

Kinkladze's former {{international}} teammate Temuri Ketsbaia was player-manager at financially troubled Cypriot team Anorthosis. Ketsbaia gave his old friend a chance to rebuild his career, offering him a contract to play for Anorthosis. He made his debut against title contenders APOEL on 21 November and marked it with a fine goal. He scored once more in a 5–0 home victory against Olympiakos Nicosia, and in February he was recalled to Georgia's squad for the friendly against Lithuania. His contract was initially only for one season, but the club extended it for another year. Anorthosis ended the season successfully by winning the Cypriot championship and earned a place in the qualifying rounds of 2005–06 UEFA Champions League, where, thanks to the club's good run, Kinkladze played five times. He started both legs of a 2–1 first <b>round</b> <b>aggregate</b> win against Dinamo Minsk, was twice a substitute in a 3–2 second <b>round</b> <b>aggregate</b> win against Süper Lig runners-up Trabzonspor, and played the full 90 minutes in a 1–2 third round home defeat against Rangers.

30|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} approaches to developing an SCC mix design. The first is material-based, the second is chemically-based, {{and the third is}} a hybrid of the first two. The first approach focuses on modifying the aggregate types and amounts. Typically, the coarse aggregate content is reduced and also <b>rounder</b> <b>aggregate</b> is used to improve the flowability of the SCC mix. The main disadvantage of this approach is that with a lower coarse aggregate content, aggregate interlock, and as a result shear strength, is reduced. To avoid this issue, the second approach was developed and, in this approach, the coarse aggregate and paste contents are kept the same as in a CC mix. To improve the flowability and stability of this type of mix, high-range water-reducing admixtures (HRWRA) and viscosity-modifying admixtures (VMA) are used.|$|R
