40|$|In {{patients}} with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), {{the likelihood of}} having a sustained response to azacitidine is increased by maximizing treatment duration. This is important as prognosis postrelapse is poor. There is also the concern that early termination of treatment may result in rapid disease progression. We <b>reviewed</b> <b>outcomes</b> in 13 patients who discontinued azacitidine (decitabine in one patient) while still responding to the treatment. Most patients rapidly relapsed; median time to progression was 5. 4  months. Reasons for treatment discontinuation included comorbidities, infections, and patient choice.

40|$|Older chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia patients have poor outcomes with standard treatments and are underrepresented in clinical trials. We retrospectively <b>reviewed</b> <b>outcomes</b> of refractory chronic {{lymphocytic leukemia}} patients in two age categories (≥ 70 and 0. 80). Although overall survival was worse in older patients (median 2. 1 vs. 2. 4 years, P= 0. 02); when adjusted for other factors this difference was no longer significant (P≥ 0. 10). With the exception of infections (older 29 % vs. younger 62 %) no significant association with toxicity was observed. These data demonstrate that flavopiridol administration to older {{chronic lymphocytic leukemia}} patients is feasible, tolerable, and may have similar efficacy to that in younger patients. Development of treatment approaches including flavopiridol should be considered for these older patients...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. Undetectable {{maternal}} serum unconjugated estriol {{levels in}} the second-trimester screening test {{have been associated with}} congenital pathology and an adverse pregnancy outcome. We <b>reviewed</b> <b>outcomes</b> of pregnancies with undetectable levels of estriol (< 0. 25 ng/ml) in the triple-marker screening test and assessed the clinical value of this finding. Methods. We studied estriol values in 6, 018 pregnant patients who underwent a triple-marker screening test during a seven-year period. Results. 26 women had estriol levels at or below the sensitivity of the assay. The most common explanations were dating errors, prematurity, growth restriction and X-linked ichthyosis. We also observed one fetal death at 16 weeks, one severe threatened fetal abortion, one case of multiple congenital anomalies and one case of isolated adrenocorticotropin hormone deficiency. There were 6 women remaining with unexplained undetectable estriol. Conclusion. Undetectable maternal estriol values may indicate a severe fetal pathology and should lead to further investigations. ...|$|E

40|$|Critically ill {{patients}} in extremis often undergo abdominal exploration despite the subjectively {{high incidence of}} morbidity and mortality. To evaluate the efficacy of intervention, records of patients undergoing laparotomy while in extremis by the Acute Care Surgery service at an academic medical were retrospectively <b>reviewed.</b> <b>Outcomes</b> were stratified by patient demographics, primary service, surgical findings, preoperative physiology, and mortality. Overall mortality was 55. 6 %. Surgical bedside explorations revealed a mortality rate of 53. 3 % without identified abdominal pathology and 90 % with identified pathology. Significant differences in survival were noted for Lactate level, vasopressor use, acute kidney injury, leukocytosis, and anemia. Therapeutic bedside exploration’s extremely high mortality rate likely represents futile care. OR procedures for patients in extremis also carries significant mortality that may be predicted by preoperative physiology. This data suggests that surgical consultation for patients in extremis should be scrutinized for efficacy prior to offering surgical intervention...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Controversy exists {{regarding}} {{the utility of}} antecedent venography in percutaneous vertebroplasty. Our purpose {{was to determine whether}} antecedent venography improves clinical outcomes and/or decreases extravertebral cement extravasation in these procedures. METHODS: We retrospective <b>reviewed</b> <b>outcomes</b> of consecutive percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures performed at our institution to define two populations, each consisting of 24 patients treated at 42 vertebral levels. Group 1 included patients who underwent antecedent venography, and group 2 included patients treated without venography. Clinical outcomes were assessed with quantitative measurements of pain and mobility. Venograms and postprocedural radiographs were interpreted to evaluate the number of vertebrae with extravertebral cement extravasation, degree of extravasation at each level, and correlation between venography and vertebroplasty. RESULTS: Pain improved in 19 of 20 group 1 patients, compared with 21 of 22 group 2 patients; mean postoperative pain levels were 1. 3 and 1. 8, respectively (P. 50), on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain).

40|$|Suboptimal {{childhood}} {{vaccination uptake}} results in disease outbreaks, and {{in developed countries}} is largely attributable to parental choice. To inform evidence-based interventions, we conducted a systematic review of factors underlying parental vaccination decisions. Thirty-one studies were <b>reviewed.</b> <b>Outcomes</b> and methods are disparate, which limits synthesis; however parents are consistently shown to act in line with their attitudes to combination childhood vaccinations. Vaccine-declining parents believe that vaccines are unsafe and ineffective and that the diseases they are given to prevent are mild and uncommon; they mistrust their health professionals, Government and officially-endorsed vaccine research but trust media and non-official information sources and resent perceived pressure to risk their own child's safety for public health benefit. Interventions should focus on detailed decision mechanisms including disease-related anticipated regret and perception of anecdotal information as statistically representative. Self-reported vaccine uptake, retrospective attitude assessment and unrepresentative samples limit the reliability of reviewed data - methodological improvements are required in this area...|$|E

We sought {{to assess the}} predictive value of electrocardiographic abnormalities in stroke patients after thrombolysis. MethodsConsecutive acute stroke patients with thrombolysis from Feb 2008 to Jun 2013 were included. Electrocardiographic abnormalities during hospitalization were retrospectively <b>reviewed.</b> <b>Outcomes</b> were 90 -day modified Rankin's Score. Multivariate logistic regression was {{used to analyze the}} association of electrocardiographic abnormalities with 90 -day outcome. ResultsFrom Feb 2008 to Jun 2013, 95 acute stroke patients (median age of 67 and 64. 2 % male) with electrocardiographic before/after thrombolysis and 90 day modified Rankin's Score were recruited in our study. Increased age (p = 0. 027), higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (p < 0. 001) and T-wave changes (p = 0. 030) were significantly associated with worse functional outcome. T-wave changes (odds ratio 5. 54, 95 % confidence interval 1. 37 – 22. 37, p = 0. 016) were independently associated with unfavorable outcome.

40|$|Introduction: As the {{relative}} burden of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia among HIV-positive patients increases, adequate prediction of case severity on presentation is crucial. We {{sought to determine}} what characteristics measurable on presentation are predictive of worse outcomes. Methods: We studied all admissions for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia over 1 year at a tertiary centre. Patient demographics, comorbidities, HIV-specific markers and CURB- 65 scores on Emergency Department presentation were <b>reviewed.</b> <b>Outcomes</b> of interest included mortality, bacteraemia, intensive care unit admission and orotracheal intubation. Results: A total of 396 patients were included, 49 HIV positive and 347 HIV negative. Mean CURB- 65 score was 1. 3 for HIV-positive and 2. 2 for HIV-negative patients (p 200 CD 4 cells/mL subgroup (adjusted odds ratio 2. 2 CI 95 % [0. 7 – 7. 6] and adjusted odds ratio 0. 8 CI 95 % [0. 1 – 6. 5] respectively). Antiretroviral therapy and viral load suppression were not associated with different outcomes (p> 0. 05). Conclusions: High CURB- 65 scores and CD 4 counts< 200 cells/mL were both associated with worse outcomes.
