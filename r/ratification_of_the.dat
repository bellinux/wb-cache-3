40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} a bargaining game aiming at <b>the</b> full <b>ratification</b> <b>of</b> a climate treaty. Three distinct coalitions are considered: a pro-regime coalition, the so-called Kyoto group, an anti-regime coalition made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> countries rejecting the Kyoto protocol and the G 77 coalition made of developing countries. We {{assume that the}} pro-regime coalition wants to ratify the treaty as uch while the two other coalitions condition ratification to further concesions. Employing an alternating offers model, we study the concession the pro-regime coalition should make for the others to acept ratify the treaty. We show that the more binding is <b>the</b> <b>ratification</b> constraint <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pro-regime coalition, the lowest is the concesion. Conversely, the more binding <b>the</b> <b>ratification</b> constraints <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two adverse coalitions, the highest should be the concession...|$|R

5|$|The {{conflict}} with Congress continued.

Congress took no action on them. When the President was slow to officially report <b>ratifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourteenth Amendment by the new Southern legislatures, Congress passed a bill, again over his veto, requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt. He still delayed as much as he could, but was required, in July 1868, to report the ratifications making <b>the</b> amendment part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution.|$|R

50|$|Before ratifying {{the treaty}} the U.S. Senate made two modifications: {{changing}} <b>the</b> wording <b>of</b> Article IX (which guaranteed Mexicans {{living in the}} purchased territories the right to become U.S. citizens) and striking out Article X (which conceded <b>the</b> legitimacy <b>of</b> land grants made by the Mexican government). On May 26, 1848, when the two countries exchanged <b>ratifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treaty <b>of</b> Guadalupe Hidalgo, they further agreed to a three-article protocol (known as <b>the</b> Protocol <b>of</b> Querétaro) to explain the amendments. The first article claimed that the original Article IX <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treaty, although replaced by Article III <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treaty <b>of</b> Louisiana, would still confer the rights delineated in Article IX. The second article confirmed <b>the</b> legitimacy <b>of</b> land grants under Mexican law. The protocol was signed in <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Querétaro by A. H.

5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection {{of some of the}} Bill of Rights to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following <b>ratification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the Bill of Rights to state and local governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the uproar}} over the poll tax {{as a factor}} in jury selection, the tax {{remained}} in Virginia until the <b>ratification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution outlawed it in 1964. Pauli Murray was deeply affected by her experience working on the case and was inspired to pursue her career in civil rights law.

5|$|Each state's presidential electors {{gathered}} in their state's capital on February 4, 1789 {{to cast their}} votes for the president.

Qualitative interviews were carried out amongst teacher-students at University of Cheikh Anta Diop, Dakar. We reflected upon the collected material mainly through theories of feminism and social constructivism, and moreover briefly through post-colonialism and structural functionalism, {{as well as in}} relation to previous research. We found that the respondents lacked deeper juridical knowledge concerning right to education. Overall the respondents expressed an ambiguity in their gender awareness, and their perception of girls’ education in relation to cultural traditions. The main obstacles for girls schooling were gender cultural traditions and socio-economic factors...|$|R
