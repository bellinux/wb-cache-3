5|$|After Winterbourne Stoke {{the route}} once again becomes dual {{carriageway}} from Yarnbury Castle {{and across the}} Wylye valley, meeting the A36 at Deptford. There is then another section of single carriageway road, {{coming out of the}} valley and up to the crest of the Great Ridge, before a further section of dual two lane road down from the hill crest near Berwick St Leonard. On reaching the valley, it <b>reverts</b> again to single carriageway and through the village of Chicklade, before following the terrain over to Mere, where it runs north of the town as another dual carriageway bypass. Continuing west, it passes south of Wincanton and then north of Sparkford to a roundabout where the road <b>reverts</b> once more to single carriageway.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{asymmetric}} mean-reverting properties of short-horizon stock returns. Over {{the period from}} July 1962, to December 1999, daily returns of three market indexes and of individual stocks exhibit a strong asymmetric <b>reverting</b> pattern in which negative returns <b>revert</b> more quickly, with a greater <b>reverting</b> magnitude, than do positive returns. The observed asymmetric <b>reverting</b> pattern is inconsistent with the positive relationship between expected future volatility and risk premiums, which is a key assumption of the time-varying rational expectation hypothesis. The asymmetry property also corroborates arguments for short-horizon “contrarian ” portfolio strategy...|$|R

40|$|Tissues of cytoplasmic male sterile, maintainer, restorer, and {{restored}} lines, and sterile plants which <b>reverted</b> to fertility in Vicia faba {{were examined in}} ultrathin sections. Cytoplasmic spherical bodies (CSB), ca. 70 nm in diameter, were observed in tissues of all sterile plants but not in tissues of maintainer, restorer or restored sterile plants. No CSB were observed in a <b>reverted</b> fertile branch of a tiller-sterile plant, nor in 5 of 6 <b>reverted</b> fertile plants. One <b>reverted</b> fertile plant contained CSB in ovules. It is proposed that the CSB are the sites of, or possibly, products of, sterility factors in Vicia faba...|$|R

5|$|Transformation {{into human}} form {{is said to}} be rare, and usually occurs at night. The encantado will often be seen running from a festa, despite protests from the others for it to stay, and can be seen by pursuers as it hurries to the river and <b>reverts</b> to dolphin form. When it is under human form, it wears a hat to hide its blowhole, which does not {{disappear}} with the shapeshift.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the oral}} polio vaccine is inexpensive, easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which helps prevent infection with wild virus in areas where it is endemic), {{it has been the}} vaccine of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries. On very rare occasions (about one case per 750,000 vaccine recipients), the attenuated virus in the {{oral polio vaccine}} <b>reverts</b> into a form that can paralyze. Most industrialized countries have switched to inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot revert, either as the sole vaccine against poliomyelitis or in combination with oral polio vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Betty instantaneously {{realizes that}} Simon needs magic {{in order to}} survive, so she places him on the magic carpet and flies it to Wizard City.

Simon refuses, and Betty attacks and eventually destroys Bella Noche. Simon <b>reverts</b> to Ice King, unaware of what happened. Later, he recounts the events to a captured Muscle Princess, while Betty—who survived the struggle with Bella Noche—watches sadly from a window and flies off on the magic carpet.|$|E

30|$|It {{has been}} shown that the reverse α–γ {{transformation}} by the diffusion mechanism in the Fe– 22.7  wt.% Ni– 0.58  wt.% С alloy gives rise to the formation of complex grain structure of <b>reverted</b> austenite. The diffraction pattern of the <b>reverted</b> austenite has not demonstrated signs of internal stress. The half-width of diffraction peaks of the <b>reverted</b> austenite was significantly smaller than that of the initial austenite. The <b>reverted</b> austenite grains formed in the course of α–γ transformation displayed different orientations and sizes including nanoscale ones. They also possessed significant concentration inhomogeneity characterized by continuous change of nickel concentration in the whole range of its values.|$|R
50|$|<b>Reverted</b> rubber (steam) {{aquaplaning}} {{occurs during}} heavy braking {{that results in}} a prolonged locked-wheel skid. Only a thin film {{of water on the}} runway is required to facilitate this type of aquaplaning. The tire skidding generates enough heat to change the water film into a cushion of steam which keeps the tire off the runway. A side effect of the heat is it causes the rubber in contact with the runway to <b>revert</b> to its original uncured state. Indications of an aircraft having experienced <b>reverted</b> rubber aquaplaning, are distinctive 'steam-cleaned' marks on the runway surface and a patch of <b>reverted</b> rubber on the tire.|$|R

Dean realizes the Giant was acting in self-defense and quickly catches up to Hogarth as they follow the Giant into town.|$|E

After seven blocks, NY104 veers onto West Bridge Street, a four-lane street with no median. NY104 continues along Bridge Street into downtown, where it intersects the northern terminus of NY48 {{on the west bank}} of the Oswego River and the northern terminus of NY481 on the east bank. As NY104 heads through eastern Oswego, it separates from East Bridge Street and curves east to follow a more inland routing. The route <b>reverts</b> to two lanes as it exits the city limits.|$|E
5|$|Often, {{teams will}} finish a season with {{identical}} records.

If three teams are tied for one playoff spot and the third team is eliminated at any step, the tie breaker <b>reverts</b> to step one for the remaining two teams. If multiple playoff spots are at stake, the rules are applied in order until the first team qualifies, then the process is started again for the remaining teams.|$|E

5|$|Physical {{examination}} typically reveals {{fluid in}} the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The tenderness may initially spread, but often <b>reverts</b> to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses.

Although {{there is no significant}} pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will.

Simon, initially unaware of where he is, steals a magic carpet from Ash (voiced by Steve Agee), flies to the Ice Kingdom, and enters a hidden sanctum wherein elements of his previous life—such as books, artifacts, and his clothing—have been preserved. He phones Marceline, telling her to rush over and bring her stuffed teddy bear Hambo.|$|E
