40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{examines}} {{aspects of}} crisis management system in corporate organisations. The paper uses a content analysis technique to examine contrasting crisis management systems of two large corporate organisations, BP and Toyota, with par-ticular reference to BP Gulf Oil Spill {{and a recent}} <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> by Toyota Manufac-turing Corporation of Japan. The paper uses an improved crisis management frame-work offered by Jaques (2010) to assess the effectiveness or otherwise of the two com-panies ’ crisis management systems and identifies lessons that each company might learn from its own issues and crisis. The paper concludes with suggested crises management strategies deployable to achieve optimal effectiveness—as offered originally by Jaques (2010) ...|$|E

40|$|Tobin {{reviews the}} National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) {{self-regulating}} program including <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles,</b> the ever-changing definition of defects, frequency of defect reports, and the notification of vehicle owners. He concludes that self-regulation-while minimizing government's cost {{and involvement in}} the private sector-has serious defects of its own. It gives manufacturers too much latitude in determining {{the existence of a}} defect and makes government overly dependent on the manufacturers for information. Under self-regulation the definition of what constitutes a defect changes from year-to-year; and under it manufacturer's recalcitrance in acknowledging a defect has kept the NHTSA from ordering recalls.

Interestingly, the content <b>of</b> <b>recall</b> notification letters plays an important role in increasing correction rates because the letters convey information to owners above and beyond baseline information about which part <b>of</b> their <b>vehicles</b> can present problems.

There are three different bases by which a consumer can obtain relief in relation to loss or damage arising from the purchase <b>of</b> lemon motor <b>vehicles.</b> The first basis is where the motor vehicle manufacturer conducts an investigation and there is the possibility of a safety concern with {{one or more of the}} parts used in its vehicles.

The third basis for obtaining relief is for the consumer to complain to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (‘ACCC’) or state and territory regulators for a contravention of the prohibition of misleading conduct in section 18 of the ACL; or for false or misleading representations by the manufacturer or dealer in relation to after-sales care, the availability of spare parts and servicing.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Since {{the advent}} of {{statistical}} quality control and process capability analysis, its study and application has gained tremendous attention both in academia and industry. This attention is due to its ability to describe the capability of a complex process adequately, simply (i. e. using a unitless index) and also in some instances to compare different manufacturing processes. However, the application of statistical quality control has come under intense criticism, notably in one car manufacturing industry where {{the actual number of}} non-conforming units considerably exceeded expectation, although probabilistic control measures were in place. This failure led to a large <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> their <b>vehicles</b> and also left a dent on the image of the company. One of the reasons for this unfortunate instance is that in classical quality control measures, human judgement is ignored and since in process engineering there is considerable expert intuition in decision making, this element cannot be undermined. Hence the research study applies the uncertainty theory proposed by Baoding Liu (2007) to enable us to incorporate human judgement into process capability analysis. The major findings of the thesis is that the uncertain process capability indices under an uncertainty environment are interval-valued and their relevant characteristics. The study further developed the "sampling" uncertainty distributions and thus the "sampling" impacts on the newly defined uncertain process capability indices under Liu's uncertain normal distribution assumptions. In order to reach the main purpose of the thesis, a thoroughgoing literature review on probabilistic process capability indices is necessary...|$|R
