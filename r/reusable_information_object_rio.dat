[...] The term is credited to Wayne Hodgins, and dates from a working group in 1994 bearing the name. The concept encompassed by 'Learning Objects' is known by numerous other terms, including: content objects, chunks, educational <b>objects,</b> <b>information</b> <b>objects,</b> intelligent objects, knowledge bits, knowledge objects, learning components, media objects, reusable curriculum components, nuggets, <b>reusable</b> <b>information</b> <b>objects,</b> <b>reusable</b> learning objects, testable reusable units of cognition, training components, and units of learning.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of reuse is well recognised for electronic document writing. However, it is rarely achieved satisfactorily {{because of the}} complexity of the task: integrating different formats, handling updates of information, addressing document author's need for intuitiveness and simplicity, etc. In this paper, we present a language for information reuse that allows users to write virtual documents, where dynamic <b>information</b> <b>objects</b> can be retrieved from various sources, transformed, and included along with static information in SGML documents. The language uses a tree-like structure for the representation of <b>information</b> <b>objects,</b> and allows querying without a complete knowledge of the structure or the types of information. The data structures and the syntax of the language are presented through an example application. A major strength of our approach is to treat the document as a non-monolithic set of <b>reusable</b> <b>information</b> <b>objects.</b> 1 Introduction <b>Information</b> reuse has a long establi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe growing use of {{information}} technologies in the educational cycles has raised new requirements {{for the development of}} Interactive Learning Materials in terms of content reuse, customization, and ease of creation and efficiency of production. In practical terms, the goal is the development of tools for creating reusable, granular, durable, and interoperable learning objects, and to compose such objects into meaningful courseware pieces. Current learning object development tools require special technical skills in the instructors to exploit reuse and customization features, leading sometimes to unsatisfactory user experiences. In this paper, we explore a new way to reuse and customization following Product Line Engineering principles and tools. We have applied product line-based document engineering tools to create the so-called Learning Object Authoring Tool (LOAT), which supports the development of learning materials following the Cisco’s <b>Reusable</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Object</b> strategy. We describe the principles behind LOAT, outline its design, and give clues about how it may be used by instructors to create learning objects in their own discipline...|$|R

40|$|For {{humans to}} gain {{comprehensive}} views of {{large amounts of}} repository contents, {{they need to have}} insight into the relations among <b>information</b> <b>objects.</b> It is a challenge to automatically generate presentations of repository contents, through, for example, search results, which reveal such relations to readers. Such presentations must reflect properties of <b>information</b> <b>objects</b> such that large sets of <b>information</b> <b>objects</b> appear as a coherent whole. An approach to this is generation of discourse structures that convey such properties of <b>information</b> <b>objects</b> in presentations. Semantic Web technology provides a conceptual basis for generation of discourse in Web-based information environments. This paper describes automatic generation of sequence and emphasis in presentations of <b>information</b> <b>objects.</b> It shows generation of object sequences and emphasis in accordance with a user input of relevance of information attributes in our Topia architecture. The resulting presentations allow users to encounter <b>information</b> <b>objects</b> in decreasing order of relevance.

In particular, natural language processing is used to detect meaningful and semantically distinguishable <b>information</b> <b>objects</b> within collections of personal information. Then, the named entities are extracted from these <b>information</b> <b>objects</b> and their features (such as weight and category) are {{used to measure the}} semantic similarity between them.

40|$|To aid {{designers}} of digital library interfaces, {{we present a}} framework {{for the design of}} information representations in terms of previews and overviews. Previews and overviews are graphic or textual representations of information abstracted from primary <b>information</b> <b>objects.</b> Previews act as surrogates for one or a few objects and overviews represent collections of objects. A design framework is elaborated in terms of the following three dimensions: (1) What <b>information</b> <b>objects</b> are available to users, (2) How <b>information</b> <b>objects</b> are related and displayed, and (3) How users can manipulate <b>information</b> <b>objects.</b> When utilized properly, previews and overviews allow users to rapidly discriminate objects of interest from those not of interest, and to more fully understand the scope and nature of digital libraries. This paper presents a definition of previews and overviews in context, provides design guidelines, and describes four example applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} jointly {{optimise}} {{the quality of}} video coding {{on one hand and}} video analysis on the other, this paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the <b>reusable</b> <b>information</b> content in compressed video domain. By introducing a hierarchical content driven motion estimation mechanism at the encoder, complemented by a statistical prediction of region-of-interest, this approach reduces the complexity and yet increases robustness of the compressed domain vision analysis applications. Taking the object tracking application as an example, we demonstrate that the motion vectors generated by the proposed method can be directly used to extract <b>object</b> <b>information,</b> achieving tracking performance comparable with a pixel domain approach. In addition, we show that the incurred rate distortion (RD) overheads and the effect on encoder complexity are minimal, especially when compared to the reduction of processing required for video analysis targeting a wide spectrum of computer vision applications...|$|R

40|$|To my wife Ana and son Bernardo. The {{integration}} {{of environmental and}} navigation data (marine information) with chart data in the electronic chart display and information system is under development.

40|$|Abstract–We {{consider}} {{collaborative tagging}} systems where users can attach tags to <b>information</b> <b>objects.</b> Such systems {{are widely used}} to add keywords meta-data to photos, videos, or web pages (social bookmarking applications). The meta-data is then used by information retrieval mechanism to provide accurate query answers. To that end, the goal of collaborative tagging systems is to quickly discover the true ranking of a tag for an <b>information</b> <b>object</b> {{with respect to a}} given ranking criteria. In this paper, we consider the popularity rank as a ranking criteria. Many collaborative tagging systems help users tagging of an object by making suggestions based on the tagging history of an <b>information</b> <b>object.</b> The problem with making tag suggestions is that they may reinforce some tags and the system fails to discover the true popularity rank of a tag for a given <b>information</b> <b>object.</b> To investigate this issue, we propose and study several algorithms for ranking and suggesting tags in collaborativ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} genre theory for analysing information content of structured documents and mixed media training material. We describe an analysis phase of an ongoing research aimed at information reuse from Operation and Maintenance (O&M) manuals in training, consisting of spoken, multimedia and textual content. The content of training was given the form of templates. We used them successfully for locating <b>reusable</b> <b>information</b> contents available from O&M manuals and other information sources. These templates can {{also serve as a}} basis for designing XML document type definitions (DTD's) for training content, or as draft versions of XSLT templates for defining reuse transformations from source to target documentation. While defining and hardening genres of training, we collected metainformation and knowledge the trainers possessed. We then formalised this as another set of genres for training. Based on our findings we suggest that genre theory can be used as 1) a framework for defining content within genres, 2) for revealing metainformation needed for enacting genres and 3) for locating <b>reusable</b> <b>information</b> contents from structured source documents. We also observed potential problems for reuse in scheduling of production processes and a need for demonstrating a single point of access to all training knowledge and material available...|$|R
