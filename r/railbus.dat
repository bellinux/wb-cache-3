25|$|The {{first three}} {{locomotives}} supplied to the CFA Lannion - Plestin line were built by Corpet-Louvet, followed by one from Blanc-Misseron. In {{the last years}} of operation a De Dion-Bouton <b>railbus</b> was used.|$|E
25|$|The rail {{connection}} to Fort Bragg was very popular for passengers traveling {{to and from}} San Francisco. Union Lumber Company selected premium grade clear redwood lumber (without knots) to build a Tyrolean Alps-style depot in 1916 where passengers changed trains at Willits. A Pullman car began operating between Fort Bragg and San Francisco in May, 1921; and this steam passenger train continued operating {{in addition to the}} Skunk <b>railbus</b> schedule until November, 1929.|$|E
25|$|Dieselisation in Malaya began {{immediately}} after MR's formation with {{the launch of}} its first diesel engine, a Class 15 shunter, in 1948. Efforts by MR to fully convert to diesel power between the 1950s and 1970s effectively drove steam locomotives out of service - with whatever left of the fleet massively retired in 1972. KTM drew its diesel rolling stock from a multitude of locomotive companies from England, Japan, Canada, and more recently, India, Germany and China. The company had also ventured {{in the use of}} DMUs (<b>railbus,</b> railcars); none of these services survived.|$|E
25|$|By March 1985, SEPTA gave into {{political}} pressure {{and made a}} concerted effort to integrate the non-electrified Fox Chase-Newtown line into the rest of its all-electrified commuter system. A $10 million plan to restore service to Newtown and Pottstown using British BRE-Leyland Diesel <b>railbusses</b> was considered, with a test run reaching Newtown on September 3. Though the trial runs were relatively successful, ride quality was lackluster. Burdened with ongoing budgetary problems, SEPTA decided against the purchase of the <b>railbusses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two Transmashholding PA-2 railbuses are {{operated}} on the route, the first trip was on 7 June 2014. The <b>railbusses</b> can reach {{a speed of}} 160 km/h, making the cross-city trip in 45-47 minute at an average speed of 100 km/h.|$|R
50|$|The Uerdingen <b>railbus's</b> {{successor}} {{from the}} end of the 1980s was the Class 628, which is still in widespread use today, although it is being largely replaced by more the modern multiples like the Bombardier Talent, Alstom LHB Coradia LINT and Siemens Desiro.|$|R
25|$|As older trains became {{obsolete}} in the 1970s, the Class 80 slam-door diesel-electric {{multiple unit}} was introduced. BREL built these units between 1974 and 1977 to British Rail's Mk 2B design with some trailer cars rebuilt from hauled stock. The power cars were powered by an English Electric 4SRKT engine, nicknamed 'Thumpers' {{due to their}} characteristic sound, and had two English Electric 538 traction motors. These entered service on the suburban lines around Belfast, becoming a stalwart on the whole network. They remained in service until 2012, latterly primarily on the Larne-Belfast line and the Coleraine-Portrush Line. In the early 1980s, NIR purchased one of the prototype LEV Railbuses built to test the <b>railbus</b> concept. This was intended for the Coleraine-Portrush branch, but was withdrawn due to the capacity constraints of a single car. A plan was mooted to use it on the Lisburn-Antrim line {{to prevent it from}} being closed. This proposal failed, again because of the limited capacity.|$|E
500|$|By 1925, the {{frequency}} had increased to eight {{with the introduction}} of push-pull working by former LCDR R1 class 0-4-4T locomotives. [...] In 1926, a Sentinel-Cammell steam <b>railbus</b> was trialled on the line for a month. Two extra services had been added by 1928 and an extra Saturday afternoon Paddock Wood working was added in 1930. By 1938 the timetable had taken on its final form of seven up and six down services plus the Saturday afternoon working; by special regulation, the push-pull services were guardless except for the first train of the day.|$|E
500|$|The 1955 Modernisation Plan, known {{formally}} as the [...] "Modernisation and Re-Equipment of the British Railways", {{was published}} in December 1954, and {{with the aim of}} increasing speed and reliability the steam trains were replaced with electric and diesel traction. In 1958 a battery-electric railcar was introduced on the Deeside Line and a diesel <b>railbus</b> on the Speyside Section. Diesel Multiple Units (DMU) took over services to Peterhead and Fraserburgh in 1959 and from 1960 cross-country types were used on an accelerated Aberdeen to Inverness service that allowed [...] hours for four stops. By 1961 the only service still using steam locomotives was the branch from Tillynaught to Banff.|$|E
50|$|The charter for the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railroad {{was granted}} on November 7, 1892. The {{railroad}} was incorporated in New Jersey in 1899. The railroad obtained a New Jersey charter on May 8, 1901. The railroad's power, generating station, sub-stations, and transmission lines {{were designed by}} the General Electric Company. In 1921, the Pennsylvania Power and Light company started {{to do the job}} of powering the railroad instead, as part of an attempt for the railroad to reduce its expenses. The railroad stopped bringing in profit {{in the middle of the}} 1920s. The railroad company defaulted its bonds in 1929. Henry S. Drikard, a businessman from Philadelphia, bought the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton railroad company for $165,000 in February 1930. Briefly in 1932, several <b>railbusses</b> were used on the railroad. Power to the rail line was removed on October 3, 1933, after a final attempt to save the railroad from bankruptcy. All service on the railroad stopped on September 17, 1933, following a ruling from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.|$|R
2500|$|On 20 October 1981, the Severn Beach line {{saw one of}} {{the first}} uses of a <b>railbus</b> on {{passenger}} services, when BREL <b>Railbus</b> RB003 operated the 10:08 service from [...] The first <b>railbus</b> concept, LEV1, would begin operations on the line less than a week later. Later model [...] Pacer railbuses would be a regular sight on the line until 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{passenger}} and {{freight traffic}} declined in later years, and beginning in 1922 mixed train service was partially supplanted by a Brill <b>railbus,</b> a self-propelled vehicle designed to carry passengers and small freight shipments. [...] For {{most of the}} 1920s, the <b>railbus</b> operated between Salmon and Gilmore, while the tri-weekly mixed continued between Salmon and Armstead. [...] In 1931, the G borrowed a second, larger <b>railbus</b> from the Northern Pacific, {{and used it to}} provide a daily-except-Sunday roundtrip between Armstead and Salmon. [...] The mixed was discontinued at that time, and freight trains began operating only as required, usually about once a week.|$|E

2500|$|In 1936, NZR and a {{newspaper}} company were {{looking into the}} development of a railcar to provide quick conveyance of both passengers and Christchurch Press newspapers from Christchurch to Westland: although long-term prospects for large railcars existed, a more immediate solution was required. [...] For this experiment, NZR utilised a diesel-engined Leyland bus chassis to create a small <b>railbus.</b> [...] Two were built at Hutt Workshops in Petone and entered revenue service in the South Island.|$|E
2500|$|The Midland railcar {{used the}} chassis of a Leyland Tiger bus, though once its body was {{constructed}} {{it did not}} look like a bus. [...] It had four wheels, was [...] long, and weighed [...] unladen. [...] Power was provided by a Leyland [...] diesel engine that could produce up to [...] at 1,950 rpm and propel the <b>railbus</b> at speeds of up to [...] [...] Electric lighting and thermostatically controlled hot air radiators were both fitted. [...] Up to 19 passengers could be carried, though with a full load of [...] of newspapers this was reduced to 8 passengers.|$|E
2500|$|Phillipsburg also {{is home to}} the Phillipsburg Railroad Historians museum. They display {{railroad}} memorabilia {{inside the}} museum, an [...] "N" [...] scale diorama, two Lehigh & Hudson River cabooses (one of which is currently being restored) and a Jersey Central caboose. There is a L snow flanger, Tidewater tank car, a CNJ box car owned by the Anthracite Railroads Historical Society, a 1922 Chestnut Ridge Mack <b>railbus</b> owned by the Lehigh Valley NRHS, a Public Service trolley owned by the North Jersey Electric Railway Historical Society, a 44-ton GE locomotive and a 25-ton GE locomotive. They operate a miniature railroad, the Centerville & Southwestern, that formerly ran in Roseland, New Jersey.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the same}} time of the Class 142 development, a Pacer <b>railbus</b> was being {{developed}} by Kilmarnock-based Hunslet-Barclay. The units used a Walter Alexander bus body. The units were given the number Class 143 and entered service in 1985. Again with two 205bhp engines giving a total output of [...] and {{a top speed of}} , the class originally had a capacity of 122 passengers. The class was used in the North East of England, before being transferred to Wales and the South West and were moved over to Wales & West control during privatisation. [...] They then passed on to Arriva Trains Wales and Wessex Trains, which later became part of the Greater Western franchise. The interiors were completely changed in 2000, when the Valley Lines service was introduced, with full back, coach-type seating installed throughout, along with improved fittings. This reduced seating capacity to 106 seats per set.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of these vehicles were built by the Waggonfabrik Uerdingen. However, due to the large numbers ordered, vehicles were also made by other coach builders such as MAN, although these factories could offer their own classes of <b>railbus</b> like the MAN <b>railbus,</b> and in Spain they were built by CAF, Macosa, and Verdingen as FER-560/FRC-560 Ferrobús (<b>railbus).</b>|$|E
50|$|The 'Hanover version' of the Wismar <b>railbus</b> (Wismarer Schienenbus) was {{developed}} in the early 1930s as a light <b>railbus</b> for economical passenger services on branch lines in Germany.|$|E

50|$|A <b>railbus</b> {{ran on the}} Kalka-Shimla Railway {{route in}} India until {{replaced}} by a train. Another <b>railbus</b> was in service on the Shimoga-Talguppa route, but this was closed in June 2007 and replaced by DEMU.|$|E
50|$|In areas without {{significant}} demand for regular commuter trains, {{such as in}} the Eastern province, <b>railbus</b> connects towns and cities. <b>Railbus</b> between Batticaloa and Trincomalee allows passengers to travel between the two cities with fewer delays.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the long}} engine bonnets {{at each end of}} the <b>railbus</b> that housed the motors for driving in either direction, this <b>railbus</b> was nicknamed the 'Pig's Snout' (Schweineschnäuzchen). The {{vehicles}} proved to be a real saviour for the Kleinbahnen, because the high costs of the generally loss-making passenger services on north German light branch lines were able to be considerably reduced. Often the Hanover versions of the <b>railbus</b> replaced trains that only consisted of a loco and one or very few coaches, which were therefore very expensive to operate. But it only needed six paying passengers for the <b>railbus</b> to make a profit.|$|E
50|$|Due to low patronage, lines {{such as the}} Pinkenba line {{have been}} closed and {{replaced}} by bus services known as a <b>RailBus.</b> During some {{times of the day}} trains on the Nambour line and Doomben line are also replaced by the <b>RailBus.</b>|$|E
