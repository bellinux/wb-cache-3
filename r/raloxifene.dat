5|$|Some therapies {{for other}} forms of cancer {{increase}} the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer, which is a baseline 2–3%. Tamoxifen, a drug used to treat estrogen-positive breast cancers, {{has been associated with}} endometrial cancer in approximately 0.1% of users, particularly older women, but the benefits for survival from tamoxifen generally outweigh the risk of endometrial cancer. A one to two-year course of tamoxifen approximately doubles the risk of endometrial cancer, and a five-year course of therapy quadruples that risk. <b>Raloxifene,</b> a similar drug, did not raise the risk of endometrial cancer. Previously having ovarian cancer is a risk factor for endometrial cancer, as is having had previous radiotherapy to the pelvis. Specifically, ovarian granulosa cell tumors and thecomas are tumors associated with endometrial cancer.|$|E
25|$|SERMs are a {{category}} of drugs, either synthetically produced or derived from a botanical source, that act selectively as agonists or antagonists on the estrogen receptors throughout the body. The most commonly prescribed SERMs are <b>raloxifene</b> and tamoxifen. <b>Raloxifene</b> exhibits oestrogen agonist activity on bone and lipids, and antagonist activity on breast and the endometrium. Tamoxifen is in widespread use for treatment of hormone sensitive breast cancer. <b>Raloxifene</b> prevents vertebral fractures in postmenopausal, osteoporotic women and {{reduces the risk of}} invasive breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{the large}} STAR {{clinical}} {{study concluded that}} <b>raloxifene</b> is equally effective in reducing the incidence of breast cancer, but after an average 4-year follow-up, although {{the difference was not}} statistically significant, there were 36% fewer uterine cancers and 29% fewer blood clots in women taking <b>raloxifene</b> than in women taking tamoxifen.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{medications}} like alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, <b>raloxifene</b> and strontium ranelate can {{be helpful}} for the preventing of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.|$|E
25|$|A {{report in}} September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality {{suggests}} that tamoxifen, <b>raloxifene,</b> and tibolone {{used to treat}} breast cancer significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also {{increase the risk of}} adverse side effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{guidelines}} {{were based on}} studies of SERMs from the MORE, BCPT P-1, and Italian trials. In the MORE trial, the relative risk reduction for <b>raloxifene</b> was 76%. The P-1 preventative study demonstrated that tamoxifen can prevent breast cancer in high-risk individuals. The relative risk reduction was up to 50% of new breast cancers, though the cancers prevented were more likely estrogen-receptor positive (this {{is analogous to the}} effect of finasteride on the prevention of prostate cancer, in which only low-grade prostate cancers were prevented). The Italian trial showed benefit from tamoxifen.|$|E
25|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs cause {{temporary}} {{regression of}} fibroids by decreasing estrogen levels. Because {{of the limitations}} and side effects of this medication, it is rarely recommended other than for preoperative use to shrink {{the size of the}} fibroids and uterus before surgery. It is typically used for a maximum of 6 months or less because after longer use they could cause osteoporosis and other typically postmenopausal complications. The main side effects are transient postmenopausal symptoms. In many cases the fibroids will regrow after cessation of treatment, however, significant benefits may persist for much longer in some cases. Several variations are possible, such as GnRH agonists with add-back regimens intended to decrease the adverse effects of estrogen deficiency. Several add-back regimes are possible, tibolone, <b>raloxifene,</b> progestogens alone, estrogen alone, and combined estrogens and progestogens.|$|E
25|$|The {{balance of}} {{benefits}} versus harms {{of breast cancer}} screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review stated that it is unclear if mammographic screening does more good or harm. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years old. The medications tamoxifen or <b>raloxifene</b> {{may be used in}} an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventative measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with cancer, a number of treatments may be used, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and targeted therapy. Types of surgery vary from breast-conserving surgery to mastectomy. Breast reconstruction may take place at the time of surgery or at a later date. In those in whom the cancer has spread {{to other parts of the}} body, treatments are mostly aimed at improving quality of life and comfort.|$|E
2500|$|Additional {{randomized}} controlled trials {{have been published}} since the guidelines. The IBIS trial found benefit from tamoxifen. In 2006, the NSABP STAR trial demonstrated that <b>raloxifene</b> had equal efficacy in preventing breast cancer compared with tamoxifen, but that there were fewer side effects with <b>raloxifene.</b> The RUTH Trial concluded that [...] "benefits of <b>raloxifene</b> in reducing the risks of invasive breast cancer and vertebral fracture should be weighed against the increased risks of venous thromboembolism and fatal stroke". On September 14, 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration approved <b>raloxifene</b> (Evista) to prevent invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women.|$|E

2500|$|Endocrine {{therapy for}} breast cancer {{involves}} selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS), such as tamoxifen, which behave as ER antagonists in breast tissue, or aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole. ER status is used to determine sensitivity of breast cancer lesions to tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. [...] Another SERM, <b>raloxifene,</b> {{has been used as}} a preventive chemotherapy for women judged to have a high risk of developing breast cancer. [...] Another chemotherapeutic anti-estrogen, ICI 182,780 (Faslodex), which acts as a complete antagonist, also promotes degradation of the estrogen receptor.|$|E
2500|$|Testosterone {{is known}} to reduce lipoprotein(a) levels. Testosterone {{replacement}} therapy {{also appears to be}} associated with lower lipoprotein(a) levels. One large study suggested that there was a decreased association between lipoprotein(a) levels and risk. [...] Estrogen as a prevention strategy for heart disease is current topic of much research and debate. Risks and benefits may need to be considered for each individual. At present, estrogen is not indicated for treatment of elevated lipoprotein(a). <b>Raloxifene</b> have not been shown to reduce levels while tamoxifen has.|$|E
2500|$|In {{osteoporosis}} and Paget's, {{the most}} popular first-line bisphosphonate drugs are alendronate and risedronate. If these are ineffective or if the person develops digestive tract problems, intravenous pamidronate may be used. Strontium ranelate or teriparatide are used for refractory disease. The use of strontium ranelate is restricted [...] because of increased risk of venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism and serious cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction. In postmenopausal women, the selective estrogen receptor modulator <b>raloxifene</b> is occasionally administered instead of bisphosphonates. [...] Bisphosphonates are beneficial in {{reducing the risk of}} vertebral fracture in steroid induced osteoporosis.|$|E
2500|$|Teriparatide ( [...] a {{recombinant}} {{parathyroid hormone}} [...] ) {{has been shown}} to be effective in treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Some evidence also indicates strontium ranelate is effective in decreasing the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Hormone replacement therapy, while effective for osteoporosis, is only recommended in women who also have menopausal symptoms. It is not recommended for osteoporosis by itself. <b>Raloxifene,</b> while effective in decreasing vertebral fractures, does not affect the risk of nonvertebral fracture. And while it reduces the risk of breast cancer, it increases the risk of blood clots and strokes. Denosumab is also effective for preventing osteoporotic fractures but not in males. In hypogonadal men, testosterone {{has been shown to}} improve bone quantity and quality, but, as of 2008, no studies evaluated its effect on fracture risk or in men with a normal testosterone levels. Calcitonin while once recommended is no longer due to the associated risk of cancer and questionable effect on fracture risk.|$|E
50|$|Lasofoxifene {{selectively}} binds to both ERα and ERβ {{with high}} affinity. Its IC50 for ERα (1.5 nM) {{is similar to}} that of estradiol (4.8 nM) and is at least 10-fold higher than those of tamoxifen and <b>raloxifene.</b> <b>Raloxifene</b> also has remarkably improved oral bioavailability relative to tamoxifen and <b>raloxifene,</b> and this may also be involved in its greater potency.|$|E
50|$|<b>Raloxifene</b> {{hydrochloride}} (HCl) has {{the empirical}} formula C28H27NO4S•HCl, which {{corresponds to a}} molecular weight of 510.05 g/mol. <b>Raloxifene</b> HCl is an off-white to pale-yellow solid that is slightly soluble in water.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Raloxifene,</b> like 4-hydroxytamoxifen, binds to ERα {{with the}} {{hydroxyl}} group of its phenolic [...] "A ring" [...] (see figure 15) through hydrogen bonds with Arg-394 and Glu-353. In {{addition to these}} bonds, <b>raloxifene</b> forms a second hydrogen bond to ER through the side group of His-524 {{because of the presence}} of a second hydroxyl group in the “D ring” (see figure 15). This hydrogen bond is also unlike that between 17β-estradiol and His-524, as the imidazole ring of His-524 is rotated to counteract the difference of the oxygen position in <b>raloxifene</b> and in 17β-estradiol. Just like in 4-hydroxytamoxifen, the bulky side chain of <b>raloxifene</b> displaces helix 12.|$|E
50|$|The Study of Tamoxifen and <b>Raloxifene</b> (STAR) is a {{clinical}} trial designed determine how the drug <b>raloxifene</b> compares with the drug tamoxifen in reducing the incidence of breast cancer in women who {{are at increased risk}} of the disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Raloxifene</b> may {{infrequently}} {{cause serious}} blood clots {{to form in}} the legs, lungs, or eyes. Other reactions experienced include leg swelling/pain, trouble breathing, chest pain, vision changes. <b>Raloxifene</b> is a teratogenic drug, i.e., can cause developmental abnormalities such as birth defects.|$|E

50|$|The {{critical}} {{role of the}} intimate relationship between the hydrophobic side chain of <b>raloxifene</b> and the hydrophobic residue of the receptor to change both the shape and charge of the external surface of a SERM-ER complex has been confirmed with <b>raloxifene</b> derivatives. When the interactive distance between <b>raloxifene</b> and Asp-351 is increased from 2.7 Å to 3.5-5 Å it causes increased estrogen-like action of the raloxifene-ERα complex. When the piperidine ring of <b>raloxifene</b> is replaced by cyclohexane, the ligand loses antiestrogenic properties and becomes a full agonist. The interaction between SERM's antiestrogenic side chain and amino acid Asp-351 is the important first step in silencing AF-2. It relocates helix 12 away from the ligand-binding pocket thereby preventing coactivators from binding to the SERM-ER complex.|$|E
