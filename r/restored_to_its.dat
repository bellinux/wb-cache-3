5|$|As {{the statue}} became {{an object of}} a pagan veneration, missionaries and the Bishop of Vannes Charles de Rosmadec asked Claude de Lannion, Lord of Blavet Quinipily, to destroy the statue. In 1661, Lannion ordered the statue to be thrown into the Blavet river. Abundant rain {{destroyed}} the harvest soon after, which peasantry and devotees interpreted {{as an act of}} anger by their insulted idol. In 1664, the statue was drawn from the river and <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> original location.|$|E
5|$|The Grange {{was first}} moved from its {{original}} location in 1889, and was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park in Hamilton Heights, on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate.

The room eventually accommodated 106 representatives from 16 states: the 13 original states as well as the representatives from the new states of Vermont in 1791, Kentucky in 1792, and Tennessee in 1796. The room has been <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> original appearance in 1796.|$|E
5|$|The Union Church {{was formed}} in 1862, with John Rylands as its patron; he laid the {{foundation}} stone of its building in Edge Lane, close to Longford Park's southern entrance, in 1867.

5|$|A {{handful of}} {{rooms in the}} modern State Apartments reflect either 18th-century or Victorian Gothic design. The State Dining Room, for example, whose current design {{originates}} from the 1850s but which was badly damaged during the 1992 fire, is <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> appearance in the 1920s, before the removal {{of some of the}} gilded features on the pilasters. Anthony Salvin's Grand Staircase is also of mid-Victorian design in the Gothic style, rising to a double-height hall lit by an older 18th-century Gothic vaulted lantern tower called the Grand Vestibule, designed by James Wyatt and executed by Francis Bernasconi. The staircase has been criticised by historian John Robinson as being a distinctly inferior design to the earlier staircases built on the same site by both Wyatt and May.|$|E

5|$|Bar Hemingway was the {{favourite}} bar of Ernest Hemingway and is said {{by some to}} be {{the birthplace}} of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him. However, the claim is disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, rather than in the bar in the Ritz itself. The bar has been <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> original appearance, with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken by the author of places and people that inspired him.|$|E

5|$|Cadw {{carried out}} a major {{restoration}} project on the house over the next 42 months, combining large scale conservation with detailed surveying and archaeological analysis. The 19th-century Victoria Galley was demolished in 1995, and the bare, external stonework was re-rendered and lime washed. Large parts of the property were restored as they might have appeared in 1665, assisted by the record of Robert Wynn the younger's will, {{with the exception of}} the attic, which was <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> probable 19th-century appearance. The intention of this was to emphasize the colour and comfort of the original building, to prevent it appearing inauthentically bleak and austere. Other sections of the house were redeveloped to hold exhibition displays and other visitor facilities.|$|E
5|$|Christchurch's {{town centre}} {{encompasses}} {{a mixture of}} traditional public houses, restaurants, coffee shops, antiquated cottages and historic listed buildings. The older part of the town dates from Saxon times and retains its Saxon street layout. The Grade II listed Mayor's Parlour was built as the market hall in 1745 {{at the far end}} of the High Street but was moved to its present position in 1849. It was enclosed and extended, and used as the town hall until the civic offices were built in the mid-1970s. It was <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> former condition circa 1982 when the Saxon Square shopping precinct was built.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, it was {{reported}} that the stone was unearthed during the installation of electrical road (likely for a tram) and <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> original location by the Woonsocket chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Sometime later, the Daughters of the American Revolution placed a bronze plaque on the stone, but it was absent {{at the time of its}} nomination in 1982. The marker is currently mortared into a retaining wall at the edge of the sidewalk on 640 South Main Street at the intersection and has been since prior to 1982. As of 2013, a Daughters of the American Revolution plaque is present.|$|E
50|$|Both Oscar I and Oscar II were {{criticized for}} modernizing the palace and {{adjusting}} it to contemporary fashion rather than <b>restoring</b> it <b>to</b> <b>its</b> original state, {{and it was}} not until the reign of Gustav V that the palace and surroundings were reconstructed to their 18th-century appearance.

5|$|Keeler was {{responsible}} for the restoration of Baltimore's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, America's first cathedral. The project cost approximately $32 million. The funds were raised entirely from private donations and not from the Archdiocese's treasury.

By the time the restoration was completed, the Basilica had been repaired and <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> more original appearance.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 1984 {{a treaty}} between the GDR and the West Berlin Senate came into force {{and turned over}} the {{responsibility}} for operation of the S-Bahn in West Berlin to the West Berlin transport authority, the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe. Soon thereafter, talks with the GDR commenced regarding improvements of the Stadtbahn in West Berlin {{as well as the}} modernisation of the Zoologischer Garten station. The Lehrter Stadtbahnhof was also carefully <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> original 1880s look and became a listed building. In East Berlin, the Ostbahnhof was partially rebuilt and renamed to Hauptbahnhof, in time for the 750th anniversary of Berlin's founding in 1987.|$|E

The lamp standards, which had been removed during the Second World War, were replaced with replicas copied from the surviving posts at the ends of the bridge. A statue of James McNeill Whistler by Nicholas Dimbleby was erected {{at the north end of}} the bridge in 2005.|$|E
