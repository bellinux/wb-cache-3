6000|$|... "I {{was born}} in Boston, New-England, and owe my first {{instructions}} in literature to the free grammar-schools established there. I have, therefore, already considered those schools in my will. But I am also under obligations {{to the state of}} Massachusetts for having, unasked, appointed me formerly their agent in England, with a handsome salary, which continued some years; and although I accidentally lost in their service, by transmitting Governor Hutchinson's letters, much more than the amount of what they gave me, I do not think that ought in the least to diminish my gratitude. I have considered that among artisans, good apprentices are most likely to make good citizens; and having myself been bred to a manual art, printing, in my native town, and afterward assisted to set up my business in Philadelphia by kind loans of money from two friends there, which was the foundation of my fortune, and of all the utility in life that may be ascribed to me, I wish to be useful, even after my death, if possible, in forming and advancing other young men, that may be serviceable to their country in both these towns. To this end I devote two thousand pounds sterling, which I give, one thousand thereof to the inhabitants of the town of Boston, in Massachusetts, and the other thousand to the inhabitants of the city of Philadelphia, in trust, to and for the uses, intents, and purposes herein after mentioned and declared. The said sum of one thousand pounds sterling, if accepted by the inhabitants of the town of Boston, shall be managed {{under the direction of the}} selectmen, united with the ministers of the oldest Episcopalian, Congregational, and Presbyterian churches in that town, who are to let out the same upon interest at five per cent. per annum, to such young married artificers, under the age of twenty-five years, as have served an apprenticeship in the said town, and faithfully fulfilled the duties required in their indentures, so as to obtain a good moral character from at least two respectable citizens, who are willing to become their sureties in a bond, with the applicants, for the repayment of the money so lent, with interest, according to the terms hereinafter prescribed; all which bonds are to be taken for Spanish milled dollars, or the value thereof in current gold coin: and the managers shall keep a bound book or books, wherein shall be entered the names of those who shall apply for and receive the benefit of this institution, and of their sureties, together with the sums lent, the dates, and other necessary and proper records respecting the business and concerns of this institution: and as these loans are intended to assist young married artificers in setting up their business, they are to be proportioned by the discretion of the managers, so as not to exceed sixty pounds sterling to one person, nor to be less than fifteen pounds. And if the number of appliers so entitled should be so large as that the sum will not suffice to afford to each as much as might otherwise not be improper, the proportion to each shall be diminished, so as to afford every one some assistance. These aids may, therefore, be small at first; but as the capital increases by the accumulated interest, they will be more ample. And in order to serve as many as possible in their turn, as well as to make the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> borrowed more easy, each borrower shall be obliged to pay, with the yearly interest, one tenth part of the principal; which sums of principal and interest so paid in shall be again let out to fresh borrowers. And as it is presumed that there will always be found in Boston virtuous and benevolent citizens willing to bestow a part of their time in doing good to the rising generation, by superintending and managing this institution gratis, it is hoped that no part of the money will at any time be dead or diverted to other purposes, but be continually augmenting by the interest, in which case there may, in time, be more than the occasion in Boston shall require: and then some may be spared to the neighbouring or other towns in the said state of Massachusetts, which may desire to have it, such towns engaging to pay punctually the interest, and the proportions of the principal annually to the inhabitants of the town of Boston. If this plan is executed, and succeeds, as is projected, without interruption for one hundred years, the sum will then be one hundred and thirty-one thousand pounds, of which I would have the managers of the donation to the town of Boston then lay out, at their discretion, one hundred thousand pounds in public works, which may be judged of most general utility to the inhabitants, such as fortifications, bridges, aqueducts, public buildings, baths, pavements, or whatever may make living in the town more convenient to its people, and render it more agreeable to strangers resorting thither for health or a temporary residence. The remaining thirty-one thousand pounds I would have continued to be let out on interest, in the manner above directed, for another hundred years; as I hope it will have been found that the institution has had a good effect on the conduct of youth, and been of service to many worthy characters and useful citizens. At the end of this second term, if no unfortunate accident has prevented the operation, the sum will be four millions and sixty-one thousand pounds sterling, of which I leave one million and sixty-one thousand pounds to the disposition and management of the inhabitants of the town of Boston, and three millions to the disposition of the government of the state, not presuming to carry my views farther.|$|E

ARC loans are intended to provide immediate capital to small businesses to make payments (principal and interest) on existing debt and thus allow business owners to sustain and retain jobs. ARC loans are interest-free to the borrower and carry a 100% guarantee from the SBA. Loan proceeds are provided over a six-month period. <b>Repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ARC loan <b>principal</b> is deferred for 12 months after the last disbursement (18 months from the first disbursement), followed by a <b>repayment</b> period <b>of</b> five years.|$|R

5000|$|A revenue bond is {{a special}} type of {{municipal}} bond distinguished by its guarantee of repayment solely from revenues generated by a specified revenue-generating entity associated {{with the purpose of}} the bonds, rather than from a tax.

Because the pledge of security is not as great as that of general obligation bonds, revenue bonds may carry a slightly higher interest rate than G.O. bonds; however, they are usually considered the second-most secure type of municipal bonds.|$|E

In paper [2] author has defined production vector Y and new type of asset A 2, that represent human work done during production of one new product. In paper [3] portfolio play was emiched about relative price of money interest rate and also unit labor cost was introduced. Some restriction on fraction demand / supply was introduced. Income constraint was main tool during the proof.  In paper [4] some aspects of foreign trade were formalized. Relative price of money against other currency was defmed. In this paper author has defined some key vectors of investment decision process.

40|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newly {{emerging}} {{states in}} the third world have been keen to establish their own merchant fleets since the political independence from the Western colonial powers. Some of them have sought for certain financial aid from the industrial countries in order to reinforce their national flag carriers. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> Sri Lanka, <b>the</b> Ceylon Shipping Corporation which was set up as a public enterprise in 1971, purchased eight second-hand cargo ships (85, 965 ton) at about 4. 8 billion yen and managed to transfer handsome profit to the state treasury annually from <b>the</b> inception <b>of</b> business. After <b>the</b> general election <b>of</b> 1977, <b>the</b> new government embarked along with her open economic policy on an ambitious project to containerise Colombo Harbour and replace the aged merchant fleet with highly modernised one. Then Japanese government pledged to support this project and offered concessional loans to both the Sri Lanka Port Authority and the Ceylon Shipping Corporation in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prolonged recession in the global shipping market. For the latter project, <b>the</b> credit <b>of</b> 5. 8 billion yen with <b>the</b> interest <b>of</b> 3. 25 % for 30 years instalments (grace period of 10 years) was provided through the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund to the CSC to acquire only three multi-purpose vessels in 1981 although <b>the</b> Ministry <b>of</b> Trade and Shipping of Sri Lanka had requested the financial assistance to buy an entire fleetof 12 brand new ships. International tenders were called in 1981. With <b>the</b> rising cost <b>of</b> ships, however, it was possible to award orders for <b>the</b> building <b>of</b> two vessels (10, 000 ton cargo ship to carry 278 containers and 3, 000 ton cargo ship to carry 101 containers). Almost at the same time, the CSC placed the orders with a South Korean ship-builder for four vessels (two 9, 000 ton cargo ships to carry 440 containers each and two 3, 000 ton cargo ships to carry 175 containers each) at more reasonable cost of 8. 4 billion yen, and also to an Argentina ship-builder for three 10, 600 ton cargo ships to carry 537 containers each at <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> 10. 1 billion yen. <b>The</b> terms <b>of</b> loan were 10 years instalments with 6 % interest for the Korean ships, and 12 years instalments with 7. 5 % interest for the Argentina ships. <b>The</b> author <b>of</b> this paper carried out a socio-economic survey in Tokyo and Colombo in 1986, and examined <b>the</b> economic rationale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above vessels built by Japanese shipyards in comparison with the Korean vessels. Since <b>the</b> year <b>of</b> delivery (1982) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new ships from Korea and Japan in place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ageing conventional freighters, the CSC has successively experienced huge financial losses which have been heavy burdens upon the consecutive national budgets <b>of</b> Sri Lanka. <b>The</b> <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interest and <b>principals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship loans is the major contributory factor to <b>the</b> losses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CSC, and the more serious financial difficulties will be envisaged in <b>the</b> trends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> appreciation <b>of</b> Japanese Yen vis-a-vsi <b>the</b> devaluation <b>of</b> Sri Lankan rupee. In the concluding remarks, the author proposes to reconsider such narrow economic justification of foreign aid as strict cost-benefit analysis, internal rate of returns and so on. After conducting field observations and document examinations in <b>the</b> wake <b>of</b> modernised fleets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CSC, the article suggests the need to formulate more relevant criteria for the future economic cooperation projects with the third world nations...|$|R

Annual revenues vary with water conditions, but generally average about US$100 million.

50|$|The {{amount of}} the monthly payment {{at the end of}} month N that is applied to {{principal}} paydown equals the amount c of payment minus the amount of interest currently paid on the pre-existing unpaid principal. The latter amount, the interest component of the current payment, is the interest rate r times the amount unpaid at the end of month N-1. Since {{in the early years of}} the mortgage the unpaid principal is still large, so are the interest payments on it; so the portion of the monthly payment going toward paying down the principal is very small and equity in the property accumulates very slowly (in the absence of changes in the market value of the property). But in the later years of the mortgage, when the principal has already been substantially paid down and not much monthly interest needs to be paid, most of the monthly payment goes toward <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal,</b> and the remaining principal declines rapidly.|$|E
50|$|The Rothschild {{family was}} {{directly}} involved in the Independence of Brazil from Portugal in the early 19th century. Upon an agreement, the Brazilian government should pay a compensation of two million pounds sterling to the Kingdom of Portugal to accept Brazil's independence. N M Rothschild & Sons was pre-eminent in raising this capital for the government of the newly formed Empire of Brazil on the London market. In 1825, Nathan Rothschild raised £2,000,000, and indeed was probably discreetly involved in the earlier tranche of this loan which raised £1,000,000 in 1824. Part of the price of Portuguese recognition of Brazilian independence, secured in 1825, was that Brazil should take over <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> and interest on a £1,500,000 loan made to the Portuguese government in 1823 by N M Rothschild & Sons. A correspondence from Samuel Phillips & Co. in 1824 suggests the close involvement of the Rothschilds in the occasion.|$|E
50|$|Soon {{after they}} {{completed}} their temple and began collecting alms there, {{members of the}} Children of Peace complained that {{the remainder of the}} unspent Charity Fund was “a loss of interest obstructing to benevolence and makes money useless like the misers’ store.” The Children of Peace began using the same fund for both gifts of charity as well as for loans to members. Those members who borrowed from the Charity Fund paid interest, transforming the fund into an endowment for further charity (and further loans) like today's Community Foundations. Since they controlled the loan process themselves, they could ensure that terms were manageable, that no one was denied credit, and that the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> remained flexible in difficult times. Members of the Children of Peace took a lead role in a similar joint stock company, the Farmers’ Storehouse, Canada’s first farmers’ co-operative, which also began to offer loans to members in this period.|$|E

50|$|Depending on {{the size}} of the loan and the {{prevailing}} practice in the country the term may be short (10 years) or long (50 years plus). In the UK and U.S., 25 to 30 years is the usual maximum term (although shorter periods, such as 15-year mortgage loans, are common). Mortgage payments, which are typically made monthly, contain a <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> and an interest element. The amount going toward the principal in each payment varies throughout the term of the mortgage. In the early years the repayments are mostly interest. Towards the end of the mortgage, payments are mostly for principal. In this way the payment amount determined at outset is calculated to ensure the loan is repaid at a specified date in the future. This gives borrowers assurance that by maintaining repayment the loan will be cleared at a specified date, if the interest rate does not change. Some lenders and 3rd parties offer a bi-weekly mortgage payment program designed to accelerate the payoff of the loan.|$|E

5000|$|Officially {{supported}} {{export credit}} may {{be connected to}} official development assistance (ODA) in two ways. First, they may be mixed with ODA, while still financing the same project (mixed credit). As the export credit is tied to purchases in the issuing country, the whole package qualifies as a tied aid credit, even if the ODA part is untied aid. Second, tied aid credits are not very different from export credits, except in interest, grace period (the time {{when there is no}} <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal)</b> and terms of repayment. Such credits are separated from export credit by an OECD requirement that they have a minimum degree of [...] "softness". [...] "Softness" [...] is measured by a formula that compares the present value of the credit with the present value of the same amount at standardized [...] "commercial" [...] terms. This difference is expressed {{as a percentage of the}} credit and called [...] "concessionality level". Thus a grant has a concessionality level of 100%, a commercial credit scores zero per cent. The higher the concessionality level, the more the tied aid credit looks like ODA, the lower, the more it looks like an export credit.|$|E

50|$|It {{is common}} for the {{installment}} payments {{of the purchase price}} to be similar to mortgage payments in amount and effect. The amount is often determined according to a mortgage amortization schedule. In effect, each installment payment is partial payment of the purchase price and partial payment of interest on the unpaid purchase price. This is similar to mortgage payments which are part <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> amount of the mortgage loan and part interest. As the buyer pays more toward the principal of the loan over time, his(her) equity (equitable title or equitable interest) in the property increases. For example, if a buyer pays a $2000 down payment and borrows $8000 for a $10000 parcel of land, and pays off in installments another $4000 of this loan (not including interest), the buyer has $6000 of equity in the land (which is 60% of the equitable title), but the seller holds legal title to the land as recorded in documentation (deeds) in a government recorder's office until the loan is completely paid off. However, if the buyer defaults on installment payments, the land contract may consider the failure to timely pay installments a breach of contract and the land equity may revert to the seller, depending on the land contract provisions.|$|E
40|$|A {{conventional}} bond is a {{debt instrument}} {{consisting of a}} series of periodic coupon payments plus the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> at maturity.

The return to the investor is the difference between the face value of the bond and its discounted purchase price. In this article, the author examines the investment characteristics of zero-coupon bonds. In particular, a type of zero-coupon bond known as a strip bond is discussed. A strip bond is created by stripping coupon payments from conventional bonds. The strip bond market in Canada has grown substantially since the late 1980 s and is now an integral part of Canadian fixed-income markets. As well, the opportunity to trade in the strip bond market improves the liquidity and efficiency of Canadian fixed-income markets, thus helping to reduce the overall cost of borrowing to the government. ...|$|E
