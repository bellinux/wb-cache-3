5|$|Baxter had {{now been}} {{governor}} {{for a year}} and was following an independent course. He began dismantling the systems put in place by the Minstrels. He appointed honest Democrats and <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> the Election Commission, reorganized the militia by placing it {{under the control of the}} State, rather than the governor, and pushed for an amendment to the state constitution to re-enfranchise ex-Confederates.|$|E

5|$|Once it {{appeared}} certain that Ryan would run, and win {{an overwhelming majority}} of the caucus's votes, Boehner rescheduled the Republican caucus vote for October 28. Ryan won the nomination, defeating Webster 200 to 43 in the secret ballot voting. Blackburn and McCarthy each received one vote. The next day, Webster reportedly urged <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> vote for Ryan instead of him.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{was one of}} a few <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> back {{a measure}} to reform {{spending}} requirements in Colorado's state constitution. The proposal, which would have diverted excess revenues under TABOR to K-12 education, was regarded as a sweeping revision to competing constitutional mandates; it was not passed by the General Assembly, but was advanced as a citizens' initiative.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of prohibition of alcohol {{was a major}} issue in South Carolina during Tillman's governorship. Tillman opposed banning alcohol, but was careful to speak well of temperance advocates, many of whom were women. The concern Tillman had with alcohol issues was that they divided the white community, leaving openings for black <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> exploit.|$|E

5|$|After being urged into {{politics}} by his uncle, Judge Roscoe Tartar, Cooper ran unopposed {{for a seat}} in the Kentucky House of Representatives as a Republican in 1927. As a member of the House, he was one of only three <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> oppose Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson's unsuccessful attempt to politicize the state department of health; the measure failed by a single vote. Cooper supported the governor's plan to provide free textbooks for the state's school children and sponsored legislation to prohibit judges from issuing injunctions to end labor strikes, although the latter bill did not pass.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Bedell {{had decided to}} run for {{political}} office. In 1972, he ran against Wiley Mayne, a Republican incumbent in Iowa's 6th congressional district. Mayne was a staunch supporter of Richard Nixon and secured victory along with the President in a year favorable to the Republicans. Mayne, however, would politically suffer after Watergate (he was one of only a few <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> vote against impeaching the President on the judiciary committee.) The damage had already been done, and Bedell defeated Mayne in a 1974 rematch.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} term, Cleveland {{successfully}} nominated two justices to the Supreme Court of the United States. The first, Lucius Q.C. Lamar, {{was a former}} Mississippi Senator who served in Cleveland's Cabinet as Interior Secretary. When William Burnham Woods died, Cleveland nominated Lamar to his seat in late 1887. While Lamar had been well liked as a Senator, his service under the Confederacy two decades earlier caused many <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> vote against him. Lamar's nomination was confirmed by the narrow margin of 32 to 28.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2007 session, Roberts {{was named}} by House Republican {{leadership}} {{to the newly}} formed Criminal and Juvenile Justice Commission. In November 2007, she was named a Legislator of Merit by the Colorado Behavioral Health Council.

5|$|In 1884, Harrison and Gresham {{competed for}} {{influence}} at the 1884 Republican National Convention; the delegation ended up supporting James G. Blaine, the eventual nominee. In the Senate, Harrison achieved passage of his Dependent Pension Bill, {{only to see}} it vetoed by President Grover Cleveland. His efforts to further the admission of new western states were stymied by Democrats, who feared that the new states would elect <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> Congress.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, {{the ship}} had an {{aircraft}} catapult installed, along with a crane to handle floatplanes. The following year, the single 8.8cm guns were replaced with a new triaxially stabilized twin-mount; two other twin mounts were added on the rear superstructure. Fire control directors for the anti-aircraft guns were also installed. After emerging from this refit, KÃ¶nigsberg was employed as a gunnery training ship. During the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s, the ship participated in non-intervention patrols, during which she forced <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> surrender a German freighter they had seized.|$|E

Gay Democratic Congressman Barney Frank endorsed Tierney, likening gay <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> Uncle Tom. Tierney narrowly won re-election on November 6, 2012, with 48% of the vote to Tisei's 47%.|$|E
5|$|Specter {{voted in}} favor of the Senate's version of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 on February 10, 2009; he was one of only three <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> break ranks with the party and support the bill, which was favored by President Barack Obama and was {{unanimously}} supported by the Democratic senators. As a result of his support, many in the Republican mainstream began calling for his removal from office.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{initially}} {{struggled to}} recruit a candidate. Former Governor Douglas and Lieutenant Governor Phillip Scott announced {{early on that}} they would not run and it was not until March 2014 that a candidate entered the race: marijuana legalization activist and former Independent gubernatorial candidate Emily Peyton. This spurred <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> recruit a serious candidate, but they struggled to do so. Former Wall Street banker Bruce Lisman announced in May 2014 that he was not running, and attention turned to former State Senator and 2012 nominee Randy Brock, State Representative Heidi Scheuermann and businessman Scott Milne.|$|E

5|$|The {{case was}} argued before Judge (and later President) William Howard Taft, who {{held that the}} federal court could not prevent the removal of {{officers}} by injunction. He advised the <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> seek remedy quo warranto in the state courts. Taft further opined that, should any federal question be raised in such proceedings, the officers could seek remedy in a federal court on appeal. The Republicans were encouraged by Taft's decision, which {{cleared the way for}} an appeal {{all the way to the}} federal Supreme Court if a federal question could be raised.|$|E
5|$|When Wilson {{proposed}} {{establishment of}} a League of Nations, with the League's charter part of the Treaty of Versailles, Taft expressed public support. He was {{out of step with}} his party, whose senators were not inclined to ratify the treaty. Taft's subsequent flip-flop on the issue of whether reservations to the treaty were necessary angered both sides, destroying any remaining influence he had with the Wilson administration, and causing some <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> call him a Wilson supporter and a traitor to his party. The Senate refused to ratify the Versailles pact.|$|E
5|$|A popular Congressman {{and former}} Army officer, Hayes was {{considered}} by Ohio <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> {{be an excellent}} standard-bearer for the 1867 election campaign. Hayes's political views were more moderate than the Republican party's platform, although he agreed with the proposed amendment to the Ohio state constitution that would guarantee suffrage to black male Ohioans. Hayes's opponent, Allen G. Thurman, made the proposed amendment {{the centerpiece of the}} campaign and opposed black suffrage. Both men campaigned vigorously, making speeches across the state, mostly focusing on the suffrage question. The election was mostly a disappointment to Republicans, as the amendment failed to pass and Democrats gained a majority in the state legislature. Hayes thought at first that he, too, had lost, but the final tally showed that he had won the election by 2,983 votes of 484,603 votes cast.|$|E
