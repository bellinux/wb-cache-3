40|$|The list is a {{fundamental}} data structure. It stores a linearly ordered collection of elements and allows access only {{to the front and}} rear elements of the list. Catenation can be applied to lists, unifying the rear of one list with the front of another. Absent other requirements, the basic list operations, including catenation, have straightforward implementations. If the list has certain secondary properties, however, the operations, particularly catenation, become more difficult. Non-destructive lists, for example, support side-effect-free list operations and are fundamental in high-level programming languages such as LISP, ML, and Scheme. Actual implementations of non-destructive lists usually apply simple <b>copying</b> <b>methods</b> directly to the lists or to trees representing the lists.

Calculating RD using binomial regression is prone to model nonconvergence. Cheung's modified ordinary least squares (OLS) method is a proven technique for handling non-convergence when estimating RD. Other promising methods include the Poison, Additive Binomial Regression and binary regression models fitted using the statistical package R.

Methods: We computed estimates of efficiency and bias with treatment arm efficacies of (a) 60 % vs. 85 %, (b) 95 % vs. 90 %, (iii) 95 % vs. 98 % using simulation studies. A total of 5, 000 datasets were simulated under each of these three scenarios. Results: The modified OLS method and the binary regression model fitted using the glm 2 algorithm in R provided unbiased, efficient estimates of RD across all assessed scenarios. In contrast, the <b>Copy</b> <b>method</b> yielded biased estimates of RD even when 100 % convergence was achieved. The Poisson and Additive Binomial Regression models had 100 % and almost 100 % convergence rates respectively, but both produced very slightly biased RD estimates. Conclusion: The <b>Copy</b> <b>method</b> is not suitable for estimating RD when binomial regression model fitting fails to converge. Cheung's modified OLS or the binary regression model fitted using the glm 2 algorithm in R should be the method of choice to overcome non-convergence with binomial models for calculating adjusted RD estimates...|$|R

Introduction The uniqueness type system and lazy graph copying are important techniques to efficiently implement functional languages [1, 2, 3].

40|$|International audienceExchanging mutable data {{objects with}} untrusted code is a {{delicate}} matter {{because of the risk}} of creating a data space that is accessible by an attacker. Consequently, secure programming guidelines for Java stress the importance of using defensive copying before accepting or handing out references to an internal mutable object. However, implementation of a <b>copy</b> <b>method</b> (like clone()) is entirely left to the programmer. It may not provide a sufficiently deep copy of an object and is subject to overriding by a malicious sub-class. Currently no language-based mechanism supports secure object cloning. This paper proposes a type-based annotation system for defining modular copy policies for class-based object-oriented programs. A copy policy specifies the maximally allowed sharing between an object and its clone. We present a static enforcement mechanism that will guarantee that all classes fulfil their copy policy, even in the presence of overriding of <b>copy</b> <b>methods,</b> and establish the semantic correctness of the overall approach in Coq. The mechanism has been implemented and experimentally evaluated on clone methods from several Java libraries...|$|R

Consequently, the copying pencil was being used as an {{indelible}} pencil, a precursor to the ball-point pen. When used dry, it left a slightly-purplish gray mark on paper, not dissimilar to a lead pencil's, but which could not be erased. When used wet, its tip moistened repeatedly by water or saliva, it produced a bright purple writing. The copying pencil served as a convenient substitute for the fountain-pen: it could be carried on one's person without need for ink or fear of leaks. Furthermore, for producing copies using carbon paper, copying pencils were considered superior to both ordinary pencils (whose writing in the original could be erased) and fountain-pens (whose nibs could not always withstand the pressure needed to produce the carbon-copy).|$|R

It consisted of a ‘chasing lathe’ by which he cut a secondary helix on the same cylinder with a tool mounted on a ‘Merton nut’ lined with strips of cork pressed upon the primary lathe-cut helix. Periodic errors were thus averaged and eliminated by the elasticity of the cork.|$|R
