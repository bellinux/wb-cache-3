40|$|Purpose – The paper {{seeks to}} examine cycles and common cycles in the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>markets</b> of the UK, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia using a {{combination}} of time domain and frequency domain methods. Design/methodology/approach – The paper identifies the patterns of cyclical movement (if any) in the five public <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>markets,</b> and searches for common cycle characteristics and patterns in international <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>markets.</b> In addition to the time domain analyses, these empirical investigations are further empowered by a frequency domain method that includes spectral and co-spectral analyses. Findings – International <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>markets</b> are characterized by cyclical behavior that exhibits phenomenal fluctuations. The markets are also pro-cyclical; they do tend to move together. Furthermore, some differences in the patterns of the common cycles and their lead-lag linkages are evident. Research limitations/implications – International investors would probably benefit from diversifying <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> stocks across the UK and Asian <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>markets,</b> especially in the short and medium terms. However, the long-term cyclical patterns across the national <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> stock <b>markets</b> are not sharply different, indicating that smaller diversification benefits are to be expected in the long term. Originality/value – Common cycle analysis advances investors' understanding of the long-term relationship and medium- and short-term linkages across international <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>markets,</b> thereby allowing investors and portfolio managers an opportunity to discern any contrasting cyclical patterns at all frequencies so as to assist in their portfolio decisions.

This led to the construction of Art Deco structures in New York City with significant setbacks, large volumes, and striking silhouettes that were often decorated elaborately.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Savings and Loan {{crisis of}} the 1980s and early 1990s was the failure of 747 savings and loan {{associations}} (S) in the United States.

The accompanying slowdown in the finance industry and the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>market</b> may have been a contributing cause of the 1990-1991 economic recession.

5|$|In the {{following}} years, {{many of the}} proprietors {{pulled out of the}} <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>market</b> and voluntarily sold their property to the government so that sale to the land's occupiers could be facilitated. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the Canadian Confederation. One of the terms of the Island joining the Confederation was the sale of the estates of land to their occupiers. The agreement to join the Confederation contained a clause outlining the possibility that the federal government of Canada could provide a grant of up to CA$800,000 to the provincial government to facilitate the purchase of the land from the proprietors. In 1875, through 'The Commissioners Appointed Under The Provisions of The Land Purchase Act, 1875' all of the outstanding proprietor-owned land was compulsorily purchased by the provincial government, at rates decided by a 'Commission of Enquiry'.|$|E

In the following years, a number of General Assemblies attempted to acquire land from the proprietors, but were repeatedly blocked by the British government. Following an unsuccessful attempt at civil disobedience in 1864-65, the proprietors gradually pulled out of the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>market,</b> selling their land piece-by-piece back to the local governments of the Island for sale to the occupants of their land. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the Canadian Confederation on the condition that the proprietors/tenants system be scrapped, ending the 'Land Question' in the province.|$|E
5|$|The boom in {{skyscraper}} construction {{began to}} falter following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, with fast economic growth {{giving way to}} the slump years of the Great Depression: construction of all sorts slowed considerably. The <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>market</b> that lay behind new skyscraper builds collapsed, {{and the value of}} many properties dropped dramatically: the American Insurance Union tower cost $8 million ($1.2 billion in 2010 terms) to build in 1927, but was valued at only $3.5 million ($900 million) by 1933; the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building defaulted on its debts in 1935 and was put on sale for just $1.2 million ($240 m). The major bond house of S.W. Straus, behind many successful developments, defaulted on the $214 million ($47 billion) in bonds held by 60,000 investors; the Van Swerigan developer brothers went bankrupt. Vacancy rates began to increase as the recession bit, increasing from only one percent in central New York in early 1920 to 17 percent in 1931 and 25 percent by 1934.|$|E
