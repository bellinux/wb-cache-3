50|$|The river rises at the {{northern}} end of the Gregory Range and flows west to the north but roughly parallel with the Gulf Developmental Road until discharging into the Norman River of which it is a tributary near the town of Normanton. It flows thorough many temporary and permanent waterholes through the journey including <b>Rope</b> <b>Hole.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there are}} no written records to {{indicate}} {{the purpose of these}} structures, archaeologists have inferred their use from ceremonial objects found within them: sacrificial flint knives and <b>rope</b> <b>holes</b> that were possibly used to constrain animals for sacrifice (since various animal bones were found). These structures were not used as tombs since no human remains were found. [...] The temples contain furniture such as stone benches and tables that give clues to their use. Many artifacts were recovered from within the temples suggesting that these temples were used for religious purposes, perhaps to heal illness and/or to promote fertility.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a device}} that you feed a bight (loop) of <b>rope</b> through a <b>hole</b> or {{aperture}} and then hook it into a locking carabiner on the harness.|$|R
50|$|Soap on a Rope is an {{invention}} that combines {{a bar of}} molded toilet soap that {{is attached to a}} loop of <b>rope</b> through a <b>hole</b> in the soap.|$|R

50|$|The ringers {{stand in}} a ringing chamber below, and the <b>ropes</b> pass through <b>holes</b> in the ceiling. The rope has a woollen grip called the sally while {{the lower end of}} the rope is doubled over to form an easily held tail-end.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} effects of {{potassium}} doping on the conductance of individual semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube ropes. We are {{able to control the}} level of doping by reversibly intercalating and de-intercalating potassium. Potassium doping changes the carriers in the <b>ropes</b> from <b>holes</b> to electrons. Typical values for the carrier density are found to be ∼ 100 – 1000 electrons/μm. The effective mobility for the electrons is μeff∼ 20 – 60 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1, a value similar to that reported for the hole effective mobility in nanotubes [R. Martel et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 73, 2447 (1998) ]...|$|R
25|$|LeChuck's Revenge {{is set in}} the fictitious Tri-Island Area of the Caribbean, {{several months}} after The Secret of Monkey Island. The game opens in medias res as Guybrush Threepwood hangs on a <b>rope</b> above a <b>hole,</b> narrating to Elaine Marley on a {{separate}} rope the events that led to this situation. The flashback sequence starts on Scabb Island and constitutes most of the playable game's setting. During it, Guybrush also visits Phatt Island, Booty Island, and Dinky Island, voyaging on two different pirate ships.|$|R
50|$|Some plates had two slots for double ropes. The slots {{could also}} be {{different}} sizes for different diameter ropes e.g. 9mm and 11mm. A wide wire spring may be attached on one side {{to help keep the}} plate away from the brake carabiner to ease feeding and taking in <b>rope.</b> A smaller <b>hole</b> is often present for accessory cord to carry the device. Sticht plates are typically forged from aluminium alloy in a round disc shape, although other shapes such as rounded rectangles were also made.|$|R
30|$|The {{above-mentioned}} perforated foam blocks {{were used}} for the determination of fixation strength in this test. After placing the <b>ropes</b> into the <b>holes</b> and insertion of screws, the top side of the propylene ropes were looped and connected to a M 8 hook, which was screwed to the load cell. The tensile test was carried out at the strain rate of 5  mm/min. A perforated metal sheet was used as a jig for these tests (Fig.  1 c). The number of repetition was three for all of the above-mentioned tests.|$|R
50|$|Two {{hundred and}} forty mast corbels were {{positioned}} {{around the top}} of the attic. They originally supported a retractable awning, known as the velarium, that kept the sun and rain off spectators. This consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of <b>ropes,</b> with a <b>hole</b> in the center. It covered two-thirds of the arena, and sloped down towards the center to catch the wind and provide a breeze for the audience. Sailors, specially enlisted from the Roman naval headquarters at Misenum and housed in the nearby Castra Misenatium, were used to work the velarium.|$|R
50|$|The last {{component}} of the Eastern Han spirit roads, the stelae {{are believed to be}} a stone reproduction of wooden slabs, which in the ancient times were placed {{on both sides of the}} open grave during the burial. The coffin was lowered into the grave on <b>ropes</b> passed through <b>holes</b> made in each slab. After the burial, those wooden slabs would be placed upright on top of the tomb, with appropriate text written on them. In reminder of that old custom, early spirit way stelae have a round hole in the middle of their upper parts.|$|R
30|$|Rigid {{polyurethane}} foam blocks with 0.2  g/cm 3 density and dimensions of 10  ×  10  ×  5  cm {{were used as}} substitutes for cancellous bone (Bailey et al. 2006), according to the ASTM F 1839. To {{determine the effect of}} tunnel diameter on initial fixation and required torque of insertion, four holes were created on each foam block with diameters of 7, 8, 9, and 10  mm. Polypropylene ropes with 8  mm diameter were used as graft substitutes. After placing the <b>ropes</b> in the <b>holes,</b> the insertion torque was measured using an analog torque meter (BRITOOL Company, Germany) during insertion of screws in the holes.|$|R
5000|$|The Last Gasp - Each player {{had to get}} a skull out of a net {{and throw}} it on top of a pontoon. After six skulls, they must return to the start, grab a skull from {{underwater}} and place it on a floating holder. The team who swims the course the quickest time wins. In Ultimate Jeopardy, the players had a skull tied on the <b>rope</b> through the <b>holes</b> in the pontoons. The player must then dive down, open the chest {{on the bottom of the}} river to free the team skull and carry it back to the start and put it on the floating holder.|$|R
50|$|Pat and Gloria {{are put in}} {{a hole in the}} ground. Mike {{is placed}} in a {{separate}} cage. A native man, whom Pat had saved from Mike's aggression, lowers a <b>rope</b> into the <b>hole</b> so the women can escape. Mike digs {{his way out of the}} cage, chases the man away and cuts the rope, preventing the women from escaping. Mike flees into the jungle, where he tries to attract the attention of a search and rescue plane, but he is recaptured. The natives sever one of his hands and drag him back to the village. The search plane lands, but the natives tell the rescuers that the outsiders' canoe capsized in the river and they were eaten by crocodiles.|$|R
5000|$|Houska castle, {{and most}} {{specifically}} the chapel, has been constructed {{over a large}} {{hole in the ground}} that is allegedly a [...] "gateway to Hell", which was said to be so deep no one could see the bottom of it. Animal-human hybrids were reported to have crawled out of it, and dark-winged, otherworldly creatures flew in its vicinity. Legend has it that when construction began in the castle, all of the inmates that were sentenced to death were offered a pardon if they consented to be lowered by <b>rope</b> into the <b>hole,</b> and report back on what they saw. When the first person was lowered, he began screaming after a few seconds, and when pulled back to the surface {{he looked as if he}} had aged 30 years in just a few seconds. He had grown wrinkles and his hair had turned white, as old folklore tales state.|$|R
5000|$|One {{significant}} {{piece of}} evidence {{makes a strong case}} to discredit the castration story. After Everest's body was returned to the jail following his lynching, a man (presumably a police officer) examined his body and filed a police report dated November 12. The report includes a set of fingerprints and a description of the body, including the color of his eyes and hair. It estimates Everest's height and weight. Then it notes: [...] "No scars that could be located on the body outside where <b>rope</b> cut neck. <b>hole</b> that looked like bullet hole. Prints taken in the Jail at Centralia, Wash. room very dark to see any thing on the body in line of scars: rope was still around the neck of the man." [...] If the police officer was looking for scars and could see the color of Everest's eyes and hair, he could hardly miss evidence of castration.|$|R
50|$|As Homer arrives, a {{helicopter}} lowers {{a small but}} powerful bomb down a <b>rope</b> through a <b>hole</b> in the dome. While Homer climbs {{to the top of}} the dome, the townspeople attempt to climb the rope to escape through the still-opened hole, but Homer slides down the rope and knocks them off along with the bomb. After reconciling with Bart, Homer drives a motorcycle along the dome, inspired by the earlier carnival attraction. As a passenger of the motorcycle, Bart throws the bomb through the hole; seconds later it detonates, shattering the dome and freeing the town. Cargill arrives personally and prepares to shoot Homer with a shotgun, but Maggie knocks him unconscious with a boulder. The town finally praises and forgives Homer, who rides into the sun rise with Marge and Maggie, whereupon the townspeople restore Springfield to normal. As a symbol of their gratitude, the Simpsons and their friends begin to rebuild the family's house.|$|R
40|$|Scientific Diving {{techniques}} were employed during a 54 day oceanographic research cruise to the Bellingshausen Sea, Southern Ocean (65 °S– 72 °S, 80 °W– 87 °W), {{in order to}} position sampling and data collecting instrumentation beneath sea ice. Eight Scientific Divers and a Field Diving Officer safely completed 112 individual dives (range 2 – 80 minutes, 2 – 28 m); 94 of these were <b>roped</b> dives through <b>holes</b> cut in 1 m thick sea ice. Seawater temperature was − 1. 8 °C, horizontal visibility 30 m+ and water depth 600 m or more. No problems were encountered with the diving equipment used. Diving techniques enabled the collection of an important data set describing the dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton growth beneath sea ice. Recommendations for future under-ice oceanic scientific diving inc 1 ude the use of dive tables with ascent rates of less than 15 m/min, the provision for therapeutic oxygen at the dive site, and adequate shelter for surface tenders...|$|R
50|$|The jigger {{consists}} of a slotted wooded board that floats under the ice surface and two levers connected {{in such a way}} that when a rope connected to one lever (arm) is pulled, the second lever (leg) jabs into the ice and pushes against the ice to move the board in the direction opposite to the rope pull. After each pull a spring resets the arm, and the action is repeated. In this way a person by an ice hole propels the jigger away. If the ice is transparent enough, one just makes another hole over the jigger when it moves far away. (Otherwise the progress of the jigger may be monitored by the tapping noise of the jigger's leg.) After that the jigger is pulled out of the second hole, together with the rope, and the net may be stretched under the ice using the <b>rope</b> from one <b>hole</b> to another.|$|R
5000|$|Józef {{undertook}} {{almost impossible}} surgical task with animals, especially horses. Maciej Galuszka-Karol also tells the following story. “He {{was working in}} the forest with his horse. At one point a huge tree fell on the horse and broke both its hind legs. It seemed the end of the horse. They put the horse on the cart and brought it to the barn. I went to get Jozef. He looked at the horse and told us to bring 4 strong rags and some <b>rope.</b> He made <b>holes</b> in each rag and put the horse’s legs through it. We heaved the horse up and hung him from the rafters. Now Jozef put the broken bones in place. He then attached wooden planks and from one leg he hung a rock to make sure the bone would stay in place. The horse hung there for three days, after which the horse's broken legs were healed. Some horses would hang for up to three weeks.” ...|$|R
25|$|In 2006, {{two major}} {{productions}} were staged {{within a few}} weeks of one another. The first opened on 29 May at Shakespeare's Globe, directed by Lucy Bailey and starring Douglas Hodge as Titus, Geraldine Alexander as Tamora, Shaun Parkes as Aaron and Laura Rees as Lavinia. Bailey focused on a realistic presentation throughout the production; for example, after her mutilation, Lavinia is covered from head to toe in blood, with her stumps crudely bandaged, and raw flesh visible beneath. So graphic was Bailey's use of realism that at several productions, audience members fainted upon Lavinia's appearance. The production was also controversial insofar as the Globe had a roof installed {{for the first time in}} its history. The decision was taken by designer William Dudley, who took as his inspiration a feature of the Colosseum known as a velarium – a cooling system which consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of <b>ropes,</b> with a <b>hole</b> in the centre. Dudley made it as a PVC awning which was intended to darken the auditorium.|$|R
60|$|Of {{the tales}} told by Tommy {{that day in}} words Scotch and cockney, of Thrums, home of heroes and the arts, where the lamps are lit by a magician called Leerie-leerie-licht-the-lamps (but he is also friendly, and you can fling stones at him), and the merest {{children}} are allowed to set the spinning-wheels a-whirling, and dagont is the swear, and the stairs are so fine that the houses wear them outside for show, and you drop a pail {{at the end of}} a <b>rope</b> down a <b>hole,</b> and sometimes it comes up full of water, and sometimes full of fairies--of these and other wonders, if you would know, ask not a dull historian, nor even go to Thrums, but to those rather who have been boys and girls there and now are exiles. Such a one Tommy knows, an unhappy woman, foolish, not very lovable, flung like a stone out of the red quarry upon a land where it cannot grip, and tearing her heart for a sight of the home she shall see no more. From her Tommy had his pictures, and he colored them rarely.|$|R
5|$|Marge and {{the kids}} wake up to find {{themselves}} back in Springfield, now in ruins (except Springfield Elementary School, much to Bart's chagrin). They find Moe Szyslak, who {{is dressed in a}} bathrobe, a traffic cone and bullets and has become self-proclaimed Emperor of Springfield (although his leadership was unsuccessfully challenged by Barney). Just then, Russ Cargill reappears on the giant screen, and announces to the people of Springfield that placing the dome over Springfield was a mistake, and the government has commenced Operation: Soaring Eagle, an ill-named plan which involves killing them all. A helicopter lowers a small but powerful bomb down a <b>rope</b> through a <b>hole</b> in the dome. While Homer climbs {{to the top of the}} dome, the townspeople attempt to climb the rope to escape through the still-opened hole, but Homer slides down the rope and knocks them off along with the bomb.
