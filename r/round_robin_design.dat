In the project we studied 288 families in three measurement waves with an interval of one year, and using a cohort sequential design.

Communications in large SOCs are so important that many designers have adopted the NOC approach.

40|$|Selection usually acts {{differently}} on {{males and}} females during intrasexual competition for resources and/or mates. Nevertheless, agonistic behavior has been examined both theoretically and empirically mostly in males. Our research questions whether {{males and females}} follow the same rules of engagement in intrasexual contests as predicted by the sequential assessment model (SAM). The SAM predicts negative correlations between contest intensity and duration and the magnitude of asymmetry in resource holding power (RHP) between the contestants, such that the most escalated contests are those between similarly endowed individuals. We staged male and female intrasexual contests {{with varying degrees of}} body size asymmetry under a <b>round</b> <b>robin</b> <b>design</b> using the monogamous Texas cichlid fish (Herichthys cyanoguttatum) as a study case. We used Mantel’s matrix analysis to compare how the behavioral content, duration, structure, and outcome of male and female contests were affected by the relative body size of the contestants. In the case of males, relative size in each contest predicted outcome, duration, and frequency of conventional and escalated behaviors according to prevailing theory. Female contest structure and outcome, however, were not predicted by the relative size of contestants. We discuss our results in terms of other asymmetries that might be important in structuring female contests, and we propose potential approaches to study female–female aggression.

40|$|Past {{studies have}} shown that objects are created and then die in phases. Thus, one way to sustain good garbage {{collection}} efficiency is to have a large enough heap to allow many allocation phases to complete and most of the objects to die before invoking garbage collection. However, such an operating environment is hard to maintain in large multithreaded applications because most typical time-sharing schedulers are not allocation-phase cognizant; i. e., they often schedule threads in a way that prevents them from completing their allocation phases quickly. Thus, when garbage collection is invoked, most allocation phases have yet to be completed, resulting in poor collection efficiency. We introduce two new scheduling strategies, LARF (lower allocation rate first) and MQRR (memory-quantum <b>round</b> <b>robin)</b> <b>designed</b> to be allocation-phase aware by assigning higher execution priority to threads in computationoriented phases.

In this study, I develop and test {{a model that}} explains when and why workplace envy can enhance task performance and organizational citizenship behaviors. Drawing on counterfactual theory, I propose that workplace envy plays a functional role: employees who envy coworkers learn from their envied targets via systematic information processing, especially when the enviers have high core self-evaluations (CSE) or when the envied targets provide help to enviers. To further understand the social influence of envy in triggering interpersonal dynamic processes, I delineate the processes and conditions that will prompt targets of envy to help enviers. I propose that envied targets are likely to perceive envy and will try to appease enviers by extending help, especially when enviers have central positions in friendship networks and thus can potentially undermine the target's workplace social relationships. I collect data from Korean bank tellers and insurance sales agents and use a <b>round</b> <b>robin</b> <b>design</b> showing that the envy-learning relationship is contingent on CSE and received help from the target and that learning from coworkers contributes to job performance via work engagement. In addition, targets are likely to perceive the envy but are not motivated to extend help even when the envier has high friendship network centrality.

40|$|Introduction Family {{research}} aims {{to explore}} family dynamics but is often {{limited to the}} examination of unidirectional processes (e. g. parenting, child effects). As the behavior of one person has consequences that go beyond that one individual, the family functioning should be investigated in its full complexity. The Social Relations Model (SRM; Kenny & La Voie, 1984) is a conceptual and analytical model which can disentangle family dynamics at three different levels: the individual level (actor and partner effect), the dyadic level (relationship effects) and the family level (family effect). Nonetheless, its statistical complexity may be a hurdle for family researchers. The user-friendly R-package fSRM (Stas, Schönbrodt & Loeys, in prep.), performs almost automatically those rather complex SRM analyses. Using real data the different features of the package are presented. Aim and methods When a <b>round</b> <b>robin</b> <b>design</b> is used (i. e. every family member rates every other member on the same items), the etiology of the obtained dyadic scores can be unraveled using the SRM. With fSRM, one simple line of R-code suffices to perform the required analysis. Results and discussion The fSRM-output provides easy-to-interpret summary tables of SRM variances, variance decompositions, individual and dyadic reciprocities. SRM means, which may be very informative - but infrequently reported - are straightforwardly obtained and can easily be compared between roles. Moreover, the package is suitable for both single and multigroup studies. Additional options (e. g. intragenerational similarities) are discussed. In sum, fSRM enables family researchers to get easily {{the most out of}} their data...|$|E
40|$|Experimental social {{psychology}} has dealt primarily with {{situations that are}} not true social interactions; in a typical study, a subject responds to a fixed, artificial social stimulus such as a photograph, written description, or performance by a confederate. Although these artificial social stimuli provide experimental control over independent variables and can be analyzed using the types of statistical models originally developed for nonsocial experimental research, they provide little or no information about the interactive aspects of social behavior—the reciprocity or mutual contingency {{of the behavior of}} interaction partners. This paper describes a nonexperimental design specifically tailored to social interaction data that provides more information about individual differences and social influence in social interactions: a <b>round</b> <b>robin</b> <b>design</b> in which each person interacts with every other person. After a brief review of available models, a new and more general model for the analysis of social interaction data is presented, with an empirical demonstration using vocal activity data. Experimental {{social psychology}} has often been limited to the study of artificial, one-sided social situations in which the subject responds to some fixed social stimulus created by the experimenter; this has been the case even in research on person perception and interpersonal attraction, where it is especially apparent that the behaviors and attitudes of persons are mutually contingent (i. e., A's liking for B affects B's liking for A, and vice versa). In research on subject reactions to fixed stimuli (rather than the reactions to other persons in the context of naturally occurring social interactions), information about the reciprocity of social behaviors is lost. Moreover, the use of standardized, artificial stimuli often precludes having stimuli that are representative of typical interactions. Thus...|$|E

Fairness is an intuitively desirable property in the allocation of bandwidth available on a link among traffic flows of different users that share the link. Strict fairness in traffic scheduling can improve the isolation between users, offer a more predictable performance and improve performance by eliminating some bottlenecks. This paper presents a simple, fair, efficient, and easily implementable scheduling discipline, called Elastic <b>Round</b> <b>Robin</b> (ERR), <b>designed</b> to satisfy {{the unique needs of}} wormhole switching, which is popular in interconnection networks of parallel systems.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} been aimed at {{defining}} {{the exact nature of}} bullying, identifying bullies and their victims in school classes, investigating the personal and developmental characteristics of bullies and victims, and evaluating intervention programs to prevent bullying (see, e. g. Espelage & Swearer, 2003). Children have different roles in bullying (Schwartz, 2000), and some pairs of children lead to more bullying than others (Coie et al., 1999). Relatively {{little is known about the}} dyadic properties of bullies and victims (Rodkin & Berger, in press). Recently, a dual perspective theory of bullying was proposed, focusing on the dyadic nature of the bully-victim relationship (R. Veenstra et al., 2007). This theory is tested on pre-adolescent data from TRAILS (Tracking Adolescents’ Individual Lives Survey). TRAILS is designed to chart and explain the development of mental health and social development from preadolescence into adulthood (De Winter et al., 2005; Oldehinkel, Hartman, De Winter, Veenstra, & Ormel, 2004). Students were asked to report about several of their ties with classmates. This <b>round</b> <b>robin</b> <b>design</b> yields in principle two observations for each relationship between two children A and B, one from the perspective of child A (the nominator or ‘sender’), reporting whether or not s/he bullies child B (the target or ‘receiver’), and vice versa. These two reports may not always coincide and are less likely to be in agreement for a bullying tie than for a friendship tie. The set of dyadic data collected in a closed group forms a social network. Many methods and models have been proposed for social network analysis (see Wasserman & Faust, 1994). For a review on the intricacies of dyadic designs and dyadic data analysis, see Kenny, Kashy, and Cook (2006). We use a multilevel p 2 model (Zijlstra, Van Duijn, & Snijders, 2006) to analyze bully network data from 54 classes collected in the TRAILS study. This model takes into account the dependent nature of the data and employs the characteristics of sender and receiver individually and as a dyad. Moreover, class characteristics can be used to explain differences per classroom; for instance, between prevalence rates of bullying in school classes. We follow the dual perspective theory as laid out by Veenstra et al. (2007) but slightly modify the covariates used in the analysis. In the next section we start with the definition and interpretation of the simple p 2 model, followed by the multilevel p 2 model, and its relation to other models for social network data. In Section 3, we present the data and theory to be tested. After a section introducing the interpretation of p 2 model results, we present the results obtained for the dual perspective theory. The final section summarizes and discusses the findings. ...|$|E

40|$|Packet {{switches}} {{are used}} in the Internet to forward information between a sender and receiver and are the critical bottleneck in the Internet. Without faster packet switch designs, the Internet cannot continue to scale-up to higher data rates. Packet switches must be able to achieve high throughput and low delay. In addition, they must be stable for all traffic loads, must efficiently support variable length packets, and must be scalable to higher link data rates and greater numbers of ports. This dissertation investigates a new combined input and crossbar queued (CICQ) switch architecture. Some unbalanced traffic loads result in instability for input queued (IQ) and CICQ switches. This instability region was modeled, and the cause of the instability was found to be a lack of work conservation at one port. A new burst stabilization protocol was investigated that was shown to stabilize both IQ and CICQ switches. As an added benefit, this new protocol did not require a costly internal switch speed-up. Switching variable length packets in IQ switches requires the segmentation of packets into cells. The process also requires an internal switch speed-up which can be costly. A new method of cell-merging in IQ switches reduced this speed-up. To improve fairness for CICQ switches, a block and transfer method was proposed and evaluated. Implementation feasibility of the CICQ switch was also investigated via a field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of key components. Two new <b>designs</b> for <b>round</b> <b>robin</b> arbiters were developed and evaluated. The first of these, a proposed priority-encoder-based <b>round</b> <b>robin</b> arbiter that uses feedback masking, has a lower delay than any known design for an FPGA implementation. The second, an overlapped <b>round</b> <b>robin</b> arbiter <b>design</b> that fully overlaps <b>round</b> <b>robin</b> polling and scheduling, was proposed and shown to be scalable, work conserving, and fair. To allow for multi-cabinet implementation and minimization {{of the size of the}} cross point buffers, a distributed input port queue scheduler was investigated. This new scheduler minimizes the amount of buffering needed within the crossbar. The two primary contributions of this dissertation are 1) a complete understanding of the performance characteristics of the CICQ switch, and 2) new methods for improving the performance, stability,and scalability of the CICQ switch. This work has shown that the CICQ switch can be the switch architecture of the future...|$|R

This <b>Round</b> <b>Robin</b> was <b>designed</b> to address this concern through three goals: 1) to identify collection materials, reagents and detection apparatuses that do not contribute BPA to serum; 2) to identify sensitive and precise methods to accurately measure unconjugated BPA (uBPA) and BPA-glucuronide (BPA-G), a metabolite, in serum; and 3) to evaluate whether inadvertent hydrolysis of BPA-G occurs during sample handling and processing. Four laboratories participated in this <b>Round</b> <b>Robin.</b> Laboratories screened materials to identify BPA contamination in collection and analysis materials. Serum was spiked with concentrations of uBPA and/or BPA-G ranging from 0. 09 - 19. 5 (uBPA) and 0. 5 - 32 (BPA-G) ng/mL. Additional samples were preserved unspiked as 'environmental' samples. Blinded samples were provided to laboratories that used LC/MSMS to simultaneously quantify uBPA and BPA-G. To determine whether inadvertent hydrolysis of BPA metabolites occurred, samples spiked with only BPA-G were analyzed for the presence of uBPA. Finally, three laboratories compared direct and indirect methods of quantifying BPA-G. We identified collection materials and reagents that did not introduce BPA contamination. In the blinded spiked sample analysis, all laboratories were able to distinguish low from high values of uBPA and BPA-G, for the whole spiked sample range and for those samples spiked with the three lowest concentrations (0. 5 - 3. 1  ng/ml). By completion of the <b>Round</b> <b>Robin,</b> three laboratories had verified methods for the analysis of uBPA and two verified for the analysis of BPA-G (verification determined by: 4 of 5 samples within 20 % of spiked concentrations). In the analysis of BPA-G only spiked samples, all laboratories reported BPA-G was the majority of BPA detected (92. 2 - 100 %). Finally, laboratories {{were more likely to be}} verified using direct methods than indirect ones using enzymatic hydrolysis. Sensitive and accurate methods for the direct quantification of uBPA and BPA-G were developed in multiple laboratories and can be used for the analysis of human serum samples.
