40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{entitled}} "Aircraft Maintenance Engineering: Developing an Aircraft Maintenance Programme using Reliability Centred Maintenance/ MSG 3 Analysis Taking into Consideration ETOPS and Low Utilisation", It brings together and explains {{an area that}} the author feels is not well documented or published today {{in the world of}} aviation maintenance management, yet it is fundamental on the continued airworthiness of an aircraft, it can be considered as the building block for maintaining the inherent reliability and airworthiness of the design. It is the author's experience that too many times operators have attempted to carry out the function of maintenance engineering with out full understanding of the reasons and implication of their actions, thus ending up with an ineffective and non applicable collection of maintenance activities that can only add to the expense of the technical operation and even at times contribute to the possibility of occurrences. The thesis also goes on to develop new decision tree diagrams based upon Reliability Centred Maintenance (RCM) / Maintenance Steering Group 3 (MSG 3) analysis for the use in developing the Maintenance and <b>Reliability</b> <b>Programme</b> and incorporating new aspects of aircraft operation...|$|E
40|$|Mean {{time between}} {{unscheduled}} removal (MTBUR) measurement is a baseline technique for condition monitoring (CM) in aircraft <b>reliability</b> <b>programmes.</b> Many airlines, component suppliers and airframe manufacturers apply MTBUR analysis {{because of its}} simplicity and industry-wide acceptance for contractual, performance and technical evaluation purposes. Owing to its aggregated nature, MTBUR alone has little to offer for showing the significant changes within a repairable component population. This paper introduces the Carroll-Hung (CH) method, an innovative approach for bridging the industrial practice of CM alerts {{and the process of}} identifying candidates for reliability improvement. Through systematic mapping of modulated time-to-failure patterns onto finger-print charts, trained engineers are able to scrutinize life characteristics and then detect inherent issues by making reference to a CH pattern guidebook. Applications at two airlines have proved the method to be simple and effective because the CH algorithm and its unique failure pattern examination technique involve aircraft system knowledge and logistics factors in developing component improvement plans. Possible refinement of the CH methodology using a non-parametric approach and pattern recognition is planned for future research. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Estimation {{of support}} frontiers and {{boundaries}} often involves monotone and/or concave edge data smoothing. This estimation problem arises in various unrelated contexts, such as optimal cost and production assessments in econometrics and master curve prediction in the <b>reliability</b> <b>programmes</b> of nuclear reactors. Very few constrained estimators {{of the support}} boundary of a bivariate distribution have been introduced in the literature. They are based on simple envelopment techniques which often suffer from lack of precision and smoothness. Combining the edge estimation idea of Hall, Park and Stern with the quadratic spline smoothing method of He and Shi, we develop a novel constrained fit of the boundary curve which benefits from the smoothness of spline approximation and the computational efficiency of linear programmes. Using cubic splines is also feasible and more attractive under multiple shape constraints; computing the optimal spline smoother is then formulated as a secondorder cone programming problem. Both constrained quadratic and cubic spline frontiers have a similar level of computational complexity {{to those of the}} unconstrained fits and inherit their asymptotic properties. The utility of this method is illustrated through applications to some real data sets and simulation evidence is also presented to show its superiority over the best-known methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The {{target of}} the present trend of the {{software}} industry is to design and develop more reliable programmes, even if, in the beginning, this requires larger costs necessary to obtain the level of reliability. It {{has been found that}} in the case of programmes which contain large amounts of components- financial and accounting programmes are also included here – the actions taken to increase the level of reliability in the operational stage induces a high level of costs. This one is superior to the one that involves obtaining systems of programmes with an adequate reliability, before releasing them on the market and before using them. Before taking into account the material and financial aspects that involve obtaining the adequate reliability, we must consider the social effects that occur because of the lack of <b>reliability</b> of <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} the visits was to discuss the current {{state-of-the-art}} with the Engineering Departments of several North American airlines which {{were known to be}} leading the field in the application of certain advanced techniques. In the limited time available it was decided to confine the talks mainly to those topics on which the chosen operators were known to have had unique experience. This note is presented in chronological sequence and is only intended to be a record of the information gathered; no derivations, or comparisons with other operators, are made. United Air Lines were visited first and reliability programmes are detailed, although the application of critical path techniques to aircraft and engine overhaul is summarised. Continental Air Lines are noted for their use of the continuous maintenance philosophy, and this is reported next. The third visit was to Air Canada where talks ranged from the applications of operations research and electronic data processing (EDP) techniques to aircraft evaluation procedures. Finally the PanAm aircraft system <b>reliability</b> <b>programme</b> is reviewed, together with a note on their general LDP engineering and maintenance activities. A bibliography is given, although it should be appreciated that some of the items listed contain information which may be commercially secure...|$|E
40|$|Bayesian {{methods are}} common in {{reliability}} and risk assessment, however, such methods often demand {{a large amount of}} specification and can be computationally intensive. Because of this, many practitioners are unable to take advantage of many of the benefits found in a Bayesian-based approach. The Bayes linear methodology is similar in spirit to a Bayesian approach but offers an alternative method of making inferences. Bayes linear methods are based on the use of expected values rather than probabilities, and updating is carried out by linear adjustment rather than by Bayes Theorem. The foundations of the method are very strong, based as they are in work of De Finetti and developed further by Goldstein. A Bayes linear model requires less specification than a corresponding probability model and for a given amount of model building effort, one can model a more complex situation quicker. The Bayes linear methodology has the potential to allow us to build ''broad-brush' models that enable us, for example, to explore different test setups or analysis methods and assess the benefits that they can give. The output a Bayes linear model is viewed as an approximation to 'traditional' probabilistic models. The methodology has been applied to support reliability decision making within a current United Kingdom Ministry of Defence (MOD) procurement project. The reliability decision maker had to assess different contractor bids and assess the reliability merit of each bid. Currently the MOD assess reliability programmes subjectively using expert knowledge - for a number of reasons, a quantitative method of assessment in some projects is desirable. The Bayes linear methodology was used to support the decision maker in quantifying his assessment of the reliability of each contractor's bid and determining the effectiveness of each contractor's <b>reliability</b> <b>programme.</b> From this, the decision maker was able to communicate to the project leader and contractors, why a specific contractor was chosen. The methodology has been used in other MOD projects and is considered by those within the MOD as a useful tool to support decision making. The paper will contain the following. The paper will introduce the Bayes linear methodology and briefly discuss some of the philosophical implications of adopting a Bayes linear methodology {{within the context of a}} <b>reliability</b> <b>programme</b> analysis. The paper will briefly introduce the reliability domain and the reasons why it is believed that the Bayes linear methodology can offer support to decision makers. An in-depth analysis of the problem will then be given documenting the steps taken in the project and how future decision makers can apply the methodology. A brief summary will then be given as to possible future work for those interested in the Bayes linear methodology...|$|E
40|$|Much {{has already}} been written on the controversies {{surrounding}} the use of different test theories in educational assessment. Other authors have noted the prevalence of classical test theory over item response theory in practice. This Special Issue draws together articles based upon work conducted on the <b>Reliability</b> <b>Programme</b> for England's examinations regulator, Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation. One strand of the work was methodological, in which we noted the advantages and assumptions of different approaches to investigating reliability of public examinations. A feature of the field {{that has not been}} well documented is why psychometrics in general does not always fit the educational, cultural and political priorities of public examinations. Psychometrics has implications for test design and reliability. Public examinations are: curriculum-embedded; it is desirable that the domain is transparent; there are many curriculum changes (which makes item banking more problematical and costly); curriculum exposure affects performance; public examination questions might need to be secure until the examination is released and then, made public; pre-testing is infrequent; there is non-random syllabus representation; item independence assumptions are often broken; score distribution might not be expected to be normal; complex assessment designs compose whole qualifications; a latent trait might not be assumed; unidimensionality might not be considered important; and there might be very weakly described constructs. Implications for measurement of reliability in this context in England include less concern for internal reliability or occasion-related factors and an emphasis upon standard-setting and inter-rater reliability. Psychometricians sometimes view this approach as technically weak and behind the times, but we raise the prospect that psychometrics could seem like an answer to somebody else's problems if the curriculum, questions and washback upon learning are the main concern of the assessment designers. We agree with other authors that the field is currently under-theorised and raise the prospect that future theory needs to take account of the educational context of public examinations. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|E
40|$|New {{products}} {{arrive on}} the market every day. Whether it is a computer, a cellular phone or a car, the consumers are attacked by commercials enticing them to try “the newest invention”. Getting a customer to buy a product may be a challenge, but trying to keep him or her satisfied can be far more difficult. The regular western consumer is often well aware of {{what he or she}} demands of a product. Depending on the product, a safe failure can be accepted with a swift repair. What is not accepted is for a cellular phone to fail three times in seven months. Every product has an expected reliability. If the product cannot answer to this reliability, the manufacturer will be forced to repair products, answer to warranty claims and possibly suffer a large economic loss. Some industries demand very high reliability of the systems they use, especially as the systems are expensive and failures could cause extreme harm. A country’s authorities have regulations for most industries and especially strict regulations for “high risk” industries. An example of a “high risk” industry is the petroleum industry. A normal requirement for new subsea process systems in this industry is an availability of 97 %. To achieve such a high number, the reliability must be high as well. When a new Subsea Compression System (SCS) is built for Norwegian oil and gas production, the laws and regulations of the Norwegian authorities must be followed. These concern the maintainability and reliability of the system, as well as the safety of the system, the environment and the employees of the operator. Reliability is an increasingly popular subject to consider for manufacturers and authorities around the world. A problem is that there are many different thoughts on how reliability can be achieved. To ensure a common understanding between authorities, manufacturer and client, several standards concerning reliability have been developed. These are often specific to an industry and one example is ISO 14224; Petroleum and natural gas industries – Collection and exchange of reliability and maintenance data for equipment. With a large number of specified reliability standards, one should think that considering the product reliability throughout the product life cycle was normal. This is not necessarily the case. In the early parts of the product life cycle, before the physical development commences, many still believe that reliability activities are a waste of time, resources and money. What they do not consider is the fact that alterations are easier to perform before a product is manufactured than after. A product life cycle is usually split into phases. For reliability activities in the product life cycle, Murthy et al. (2008) suggests eight phases. The first three occur during the predevelopment, the two following take place during production, while the last three are part of the post-development. The events taking place in these phases and the main tasks of a reliability engineer are well described, and it is thus a good option for Design for Reliability. Reliability engineering has existed as an engineering discipline for several decades now. Especially the nuclear and the aerospace industries have studied and developed methods for  reliability. The methods can help detect and evaluate possible hazards and failure modes experienced by the system or product during its operational life. Some of the methods study how and why the hazards may occur, while other studies how a failure affects the overall system. Through probability estimates, the reliability of a system is found. Examples of such methods are HAZID, FMEA and FTA. Even though we have methods for reliability straight in front of our nose, many are unaware of why they should be used. A system will never be 100 % reliable, because of all the factors contributing to a reduced reliability. In all eight life cycle phases such factors can be found. Whether the manufacturer is in the car industry or the petroleum industry, many of the factors will be the same. One important issue is uncertainty, especially of the epistemic type. This is the uncertainty which we cannot know is there. It is hard to say whether the communication is good enough or if the inputs to the reliability methods are acceptable. Another factor is the human being who is unpredictable and thus unreliable. He or she partakes in every step of the product development and is thus probable to contribute to the decreased reliability. However, we cannot let the fear for such factors leading to less reliable products keep us from developing something new. By being aware of them, we can use the factors to employ reliability methods and thus increase the possibility that the methods are used correctly. In using several methods to study the same product or system, we are more likely to get a full picture of the hazards, failures and overall product reliability. One type of analysis including several methods is the RAM analysis. This studies availability and maintainability together with reliability. The three disciplines are highly connected and equally important for the product performance. Although the RAM analysis is a very efficient tool, it cannot stand alone. It is necessary to use other methods prior to it to obtain the input, as well as some methods afterwards which can make use of the outputs. Placing a reliability method at a random time during the design and development phases is not considered good utilization of the method. It must be used when the necessary information is available and the output can be of use. To combine and place the methods correctly, a methodology has been developed. This is described at a level meant for entirely new products, whether they are standard products or one-of-a-kind. The methodology is very general, but for industries where the reliability is very important, they should be specified. The specification can be according to the industry, but it would be even better according to organisation. A specified example has been prepared for a subsea organisation. The purpose of both the general and the specified methodology is to use them as a basis in the development of <b>reliability</b> <b>programmes.</b> <b>Reliability</b> <b>programmes</b> are established specifically for one product development project, often for one phase at the time. It states why a method is chosen, when it should be used and the responsibilities where the product reliability is concerned. It should be based on the project risk, the project tasks and the available time and resources. Using a reliability methodology to choose the methods and their combination will simplify the programme development and ensure its quality. For manufacturers who do not understand why reliability {{should be included in the}} design process, or how this can be done, a website is useful. The internet is highly accessible, easy to use and not time consuming. If a website for Design for Reliability first is developed, it can be used as an educational tool by and for reliability engineers. It can also help in the development of more specific methodologies and <b>reliability</b> <b>programmes.</b> <b>Reliability</b> methods, methodologies and programmes will train a manufacturing organisation in thinking differently when they develop new systems and products. The outcome of the development will be products which are reliable, safe and functioning as they are supposed to. This will again lead to more satisfied customers. No customer will accept that reliability activities were left out of the product development when they stand with a failed product in their hands. </p...|$|R

Recent improvements in Computer-Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis (CAQDAS) software design, if used correctly, has the “ability to support the research process” (Corbin and Strauss, 2008).

40|$|M. Phil (Engineering Management) The {{importance}} {{of an effective}} maintenance programme cannot be over-emphasized because such a programme plays such {{an important role in}} the effectiveness of lean manufacturing. Maintenance may be considered the health care of any engineering equipment and its equipment. It is required to reduce waste effectively, and to run an efficient, continuous locomotive operation within a business or service operation. The cost of regular maintenance is very small when it is compared to the cost of a major breakdown at which time production is held up. The main purpose of regular maintenance is to ensure that all equipment required for production is operating at 100 % efficiency at all times. Through short daily inspections, cleaning, lubricating, and making of minor adjustments, minor problems can be detected and corrected before they become major problems that can shut down a production line. A good maintenance programme requires company-wide participation and support by everyone from top executives to shop floor personnel (Dale, 2008) The function of reliability engineering is to develop the reliability requirements for a product, establish an adequate <b>reliability</b> <b>programme,</b> and perform appropriate analyses and tasks to ensure that the product meets its requirements. These tasks are managed by a reliability engineer who usually holds an accredited engineering degree and has additional reliability-specific education and training. Reliability engineering is closely associated with maintainability engineering and logistics engineering. Many problems from other fields can also be tackled using reliability engineering techniques (O’Connor 2010). Reliability is defined as the probability that a device will perform its required function under stated conditions for a specific period of time, and quality can be defined as how the recipient of the product or service views the product (Barringer, 2006). Therefore the two cannot be viewed differently as they both have the same focus which is the end result of the product’s performance. The findings reveal that customers should form part of reliability management systems; the development of ways to identify possible failure before it actually happens is key in achieving reliability targets; and training of key personnel on engineering and quality department as well as resource planning and utilization is a key towards eliminating reliability challenges...|$|E

It refers to the term resilience as used in socio-ecological systems and applies it to assess the long-term functionality and effectiveness of industrial organizations in an uncertain world.

To illustrate the idea of resilience we examine machine <b>reliability</b> improvement <b>programmes</b> using System Dynamics models to investigate situations when internal or external stress can lead to regime shift in production systems and make them move to an undesirable configuration e. g. from proactive to reactive maintenance mode.

System Dynamics methodology offers powerful tools for examining the impacts of various policy options on the dynamics of resilience in production systems.

40|$|In {{reliability}} growth {{models in}} particular, and {{project risk management}} more generally, improving the reliability of a system or product is limited by constraints on cost and time.

Prospective analysis of bacterial and viral genomes can identify antigenic epitopes encoded within individual genes that may act as effective vaccines against specific pathogens. Since B-cell epitope prediction remains unreliable, we concentrate on T-cell epitopes, peptides which bind with high affinity to Major Histacompatibility Complexes (MHC). In this report, we evaluate the veracity of identified T-cell epitope ensembles, as generated by a cascade of predictive algorithms (SignalP, Vaxijen, MHCPred, IDEB, EpiJen), as a candidate vaccine against the model pathogen uropathogenic gram negative bacteria Escherichia coli (E-coli) strain 536 (O 6 :K 15 :H 31). An immunoinformatic approach was used to identify 23 epitopes within the E-coli proteome. These epitopes constitute the most promiscuous antigenic sequences that bind across more than one HLA allele with high affinity (IC 50 < 50 nM).

For this reason a study was undertaken to develop a staffing programme that would facilitate cost-effectiveness as well as quality nursing care. The nursing managers' role is not only to maintain cost-effectiveness but also to facilitate wholeness in patients and nursing staff. To achieve wholeness an exploratory. descriptive instrumental study was conducted and the Nursing Theory of Wholeness was used as a foundation for this study. Various research techniques were used such as scheduled observation, a structured questionnaire, nursing audit and a semi structured interviewing technique to quantify results. An analysis was conducted retrospectively to verify the statistical significance of a cost effective staffing programme. A staffing programme was designed consisting of seven steps to provide a basis for validity and <b>reliability</b> of the <b>programme.</b> The staffing programme proved to be cost-effective and proved to be statistically significant and shows a significant difference on a I% significance level (p = < 0, 003).

40|$|The {{aerospace}} industry is moving towards {{a new paradigm}} for the statement of reliability specifications. This paradigm is not a technical metric inherent to a system in isolation, but rather encompasses the wider objectives, operational profile and logistic priorities of its customer. This customer focus is encapsulated in the metrics Failure Free Operating Period and Maintenance Free Operating Period. These metrics describe the duration of effective system operation, {{in the first case}} for systems where faults and maintenance are permitted and in the second for systems where faults may not be repaired. As part of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) funded Aerospace Project for Insertion of <b>Reliability</b> (ASPIRE) research <b>programme,</b> which itself is part of the Ultra Reliable Aircraft (URA) programme, representatives of leading aerospace companies were interviewed about their opinion on how this new reliability paradigm and associated concepts would affect their way of doing business and their engineering processes. It would appear that the {{aerospace industry}} is ready for a move to a more realistic set of reliability metrics and away from the old style MTBF based metrics. This sea change would most likely be welcomed by customers, but as yet the manufacturing companies are unconvinced that such a radical move would be a good thing. Much of the resistance to change is due to old-fashioned, but well entrenched, beliefs in the traditional way of doing things. A move away from this would bring freshness to the industry and lead to cost and time savings as the traditional approach is dropped in favour of a more planned and thought out approach.

40|$|This thesis has {{investigated}} {{the application of}} CFRP and GFRP bars as longitudinal reinforcement for continuously supported concrete beams. Two series of simply and continuously supported CFRP and GFRP reinforced concrete beams were tested in flexure. In addition, a continuously supported steel reinforced concrete beam was tested for comparison purposes. The FRP reinforced concrete continuous beams were reinforced {{in a way to}} accomplish three possible reinforcement combinations at the top and bottom layers of such continuous beams. The experimental results revealed that over-reinforcing the bottom layer of either the simply or continuously supported FRP beams is a key factor in controlling the width and propagation of cracks, enhancing the load capacity, and reducing the deflection of such beams. However, continuous concrete beams reinforced with CFRP bars exhibited a remarkable wide crack over the middle support that significantly influenced their behaviour. The ACI 440. 1 R- 06 equations have been validated against experimental results of beams tested. Comparisons between experimental results and those obtained from simplified methods proposed by the ACI 440 Committee show that ACI 440. 1 R- 06 equations can reasonably predict the load capacity and deflection of the simply and continuously supported GFRP reinforced concrete beams tested. However, The potential capabilities of these equations for predicting the load capacity and deflection of continuous CFRP reinforced concrete beams have, however, been adversely affected by the de-bonding of top CFRP bars from concrete. An analytical technique, which presents an iterative procedure based on satisfying force equilibrium and deformation compatibility conditions, has been introduced in this research. This technique developed a computer program to investigate flexural behaviour in particular the flexural strength and deflection of simple and continuously supported FRP reinforced concrete beams. The analytical modelling program has been compared against different prediction methods, namely ACI 440, the bilinear method, mean moment inertia method and Benmokrane¿s method. This comparison revealed the <b>reliability</b> of this <b>programme</b> in producing more enhanced results in predicting the behaviour of the FRP reinforced beams more than the above stated methods...|$|R
40|$|The recent move to in situ {{conservation}} management world-wide {{is supported}} by, and stems from the 1992 International Convention on Biological Diversity. The Department of Conservation - charged with the conservation of New Zealand's natural resources - has directed efforts towards the restoration of natural processes as an avenue to halt local biodiversity decline. Ecosystem, habitat, and nature restoration programmes such as the Boundary Stream Mainland Island Project (BSMIP) represent the forefront of conservation management, combining intensive multi-species pest control, with broad-scale hierarchical monitoring programmes. Monitoring programmes confer information that is intended to support decision-making and management by the reduction of uncertainty, or by increasing knowledge. The validity of monitoring programmes depends on three key parts; the guiding objectives, biological relevance, and statistical reliability. Seven major long-term monitoring programmes established at the BSMIP were evaluated {{according to the above}} criteria. All monitoring programmes had appropriate guiding objectives, and were biologically relevant (outcome and result monitoring were balanced respective {{to each other and to}} the restoration intervention and efforts at BSMIP). The statistical <b>reliability</b> of the <b>programmes</b> was appraised with the use of the Computer programme MONITOR, which provided a calculated value for the statistical power of the monitoring programmes. All monitoring programmes except two (Lizard monitoring: which was initially designed as a short-term species survey, and Mustelid monitoring: which would be a good candidate for a double sampling methodology) had a robust design (evaluated using the actual initial data, and conservative criteria for the detection of population change). The monitoring programmes that did achieve a level of statistical robustness, provided a statistical power of 0. 8 (80 %) within appropriate timeframes for restoration of ecosystem processes (e. g. the timeframe for detection of a 10 % change in the abundance, density, relative index, etc of the Result monitoring programmes: Rodents = three years, Possums = six years, and Outcome monitoring programmes: Weta = five years, Ground Invertebrates = four years, Birds (species nos.) = four years, Vegetation (Species, and sapling nos.) = 15 years). The guiding objectives for monitoring programmes must have clear, specific, measurable, and achievable goals, in-order to identify appropriate variables, in both spatial and temporal scales. The biological relevance or "linkage" between monitored groups is important and must be at least outlined, for monitoring programmes to be able to identify potential cause and effect. Statistical reliability (the balance between statistical significance, statistical power, and the timeframe for a conclusive result to be determined) is important, as it is the key method of detecting change. Statistical power can improve the design and efficiency of monitoring programmes and clarify research results.
