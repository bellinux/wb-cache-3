25|$|There is a {{technical}} problem with {{recovery of the}} exhaled gas. Simply venting it to a <b>return</b> <b>hose</b> through a non-return valve will not work, as the hose must be maintained at exactly the ambient pressure at {{the depth of the}} helmet, otherwise the gas from the helmet will either free-flow out under pressure, or not flow out at all because of back pressure. This obstacle is overcome by using an exhaust valve working on the same principle as the demand valve, which opens the exhaust valve by using the leverage of a diaphragm sensing the pressure difference between the helmet interior pressure and the ambient pressure, This only requires the pressure in the reclaim hose to be lower than ambient at the diver to function. The same principle is used in a diving chamber's Built-in breathing system (BIBS).|$|E
5000|$|The {{hydraulic}} pump {{is of the}} vaned rotor type, typically of Saginaw manufacture, and {{is connected to the}} steering box via flexible feed and <b>return</b> <b>hoses.</b> The fluid reservoir is incorporated in the pump's end cover. Typical system operating pressures are in the range 7.8 - 8.8 MPa, the operating medium being automatic transmission fluid.|$|R
40|$|Described is {{a project}} in which parents of profoundly and {{severely}} mentally retarded children were taught techniques of operant conditioning {{to be used in}} training their children in self help skills such as feeding, toileting, and dressing, with the end goal of reducing the anxiety level of parents. Involved were 25 parents whose children were on the waiting list for admission to the Colin Anderson Center, a West Virginia state institution for the retarded. After a 3 -day workshop on the fundamentals of operant conditioning, parents kept progress recordings of their daily work at home training their child in a particular self help skill for 1 month. Then each parent met with the investigator of the project to discuss the training and to have filmed the parent's demonstration of how they taught their children. Following evaluation of the filmed technique, parents <b>returned</b> <b>hose</b> to work with their child for anothe...|$|R
60|$|It {{seems that}} in the village {{there was an old}} woman frightfully {{disfigured}} by fire, and not quite sane as the people thought. She was harmless, but never showed herself by day, and only came out at night to work in her garden or take the air. Many of the ignorant peasants feared her, however; for the country abounds in fairy legends, and strange tales of ghosts and goblins. But the more charitable left bread at her door, and took in <b>return</b> the <b>hose</b> she knit or the thread she spun.|$|R
2500|$|Availability of lithium {{hydroxide}} (LiOH) for removing carbon dioxide presented a serious problem. The LM's internal stock of LiOH canisters {{was not sufficient}} to support the crew until return, and the remainder was stored in the descent stage, out of reach. The CM had an adequate supply of canisters, but these were incompatible with the LM. Engineers on the ground improvised a way to join the cube-shaped CM canisters to the LM's cylindrical canister-sockets by drawing air through them with a suit <b>return</b> <b>hose.</b> NASA engineers referred to the improvised device as [...] "the mailbox".|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of {{compressed}} air, or Nitrox mixtures, the exhaled gas is not valuable enough to justify the expense of recycling, but helium-based mixtures are considerably more expensive, and as the depth increases, the amount of gas used (in terms of mass, or number of molecules) increases {{in direct proportion to}} the ambient pressure. As a result, gas cost is a significant factor in deep open circuit diving with helium-based mixtures for long periods. By using a return line for the exhaled gas, it can be recompressed and used again, almost indefinitely. It is necessary to remove carbon dioxide from the reclaimed gas, but this is relatively cheap and uncomplicated. It is generally removed by a scrubber, which is a filter packed with a chemical which reacts with and removes the carbon dioxide from the gas. The reclaimed gas is also filtered to remove odour and microorganisms, and oxygen is added to the required concentration. The gas is compressed for storage between uses.There is a technical problem with recovery of the exhaled gas. Simply venting it to a <b>return</b> <b>hose</b> through a non-return valve will not work, as the hose must be maintained at exactly the ambient pressure at the depth of the helmet, otherwise the gas from the helmet will either free-flow out under pressure, or not flow out at all because of back pressure.

40|$|As the {{petroleum}} industry enhances {{their efforts to}} locate and produce fields {{in more and more}} challenged areas, bigger and deeper boreholes are required. The hydraulics of the borehole suddenly becomes the major power consumer of the drilling process. The proposed system where circulation occurs through hoses is a response to these increased hydraulic power requirements. A drilling system where mud circulation occurs in hoses instead of through the annulus is under development. Testing has been performed 3 times. The 2 first was drilled in 1990 - 92 and the third in 2009. The ones drilled during the 90 s experienced no problems due to an anchorage system. The anchorage kept {{the upper part of the}} BHA stationary, absorbing the present mechanical lift. The anchorage did not have the ability to measure the resulting lift. The third attempt had no such anchorage. It was believed an anchorage was unnecessary due to a new refraction method. This new method was expected to not need excessive weight on bit. However, the third attempt was unsuccessful. An excel spreadsheet program have been modeled to calculate the lift forces. The program is built to be user friendly, where the user can input key parameters to simulate lift forces at different scenarios. An estimate of the present lift forces at a given scenarios can thus be calculated. The largest lift contributors to the system are the stagnation force and the frictional force in the <b>return</b> <b>hose.</b> Frictional forces can be reduced by increased <b>return</b> <b>hose</b> diameter, or lower flow rate. The stagnation force decreases with increased nozzle angle, and increases with decreased nozzle outlet area. Lift will occur in the range of 6 to 80 tons depending on the scenario. A slight change in parameters can increase the lift by 10 to 30 tons. This program gives a good estimate of the lift forces, and design of the system should be based on a preliminary analysis. </p...|$|E
