Another aim was to assess the self-reported hearing loss handicap and compare it to audiometric measurements. Medical records from individuals diagnosed with childhood cancer and treated with platinum-based chemotherapy between 1985 and 2000 at the University Hospital in Lund Sweden were reviewed retrospectively. Fifteen subjects, who fulfilled the eligibility criteria set for the study, underwent a thorough audiometric evaluation. The results show that the hearing loss, in subjects with ototoxicity had increased after the end of treatment, to include also the lower frequencies. The largest deterioration in hearing thresholds, up to 55 dB HL, was found at frequencies above 2 kHz. The findings also reveal that the subjects have a considerably greater hearing loss handicap and disability than would be expected from the results of the audiometric evaluations. The conclusion of this study is that children and adolescence treated with platinum-based chemotherapy should have <b>regular</b> <b>audiometric</b> follow-up <b>examinations,</b> also many years after the end of treatment. Furthermore, assessments of self-reported hearing disability should be made during and after chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{identify}} a parameter to distinguish normal hearing from hearing impairment {{in the early}} stages. The parameter was obtained from transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), overcoming {{the limitations of the}} usually adopted waveform descriptive parameters which may fail in standard clinical screenings. Material/Methods: <b>Audiometric</b> <b>examinations</b> and TEOAE analysis were conducted on 15 normal ears and on 14 hearing-impaired ears that exhibited an audiometric notch around 4 kHz. TEOAE signals were analyzed through a multivariate technique to filter out the individual variability and to highlight the dynamic structure of the signals. The new parameter (named radius 2 -dimension - RAD 2 D) was defined and evaluated for simulated TEOAE signals modeling a different amount of hearing impairment. Results: <b>Audiometric</b> <b>examinations</b> indicated 14 ears as impaired-hearing (IH), while the TEOAE ILO 92 whole reproducibility parameter (WWR) indicated as IH 7 signals out of 14 (50 %). The proposed new parameter indicated as IH 9 signals out of 14 (64 %), reducing the number of false negative cases of WWR. Conclusions: In this preliminary study there is evidence that the new parameter RAD 2 D defines the topology and the quantification of the damage in the inner ear.

40|$|Long-term {{observations}} have obviously {{proved that}} possibly earlier diagnostics of hearing defects, adequate estimation and therapy are {{essential factors for}} elaboration of verbal contacts and integration in society of children with hearing defects. As the result of insufficient and inadequate stimulation at early age - deficit of sound impulse in infants could {{be the cause of}} incomplete functional development and further maturation of hearing centre. Unfortunately, the today known and widely used subjective methods of examination do not allow to detect precisely the threshold of hearing at early age. The aim {{of this study was to}} ascertain the effectivity of caustically initiated brain stem potential detection method (BERA) used for precise detection of hearing threshold in children of early age. The work was performed in the Children Hearing Centre of Latvia and in the Centre of Social Paediatrics, Medical Faculty of University of Latvia. Totally 136 children at the age from two to 168 months were examined. The objectivized detection of hearing threshold (BERA) was performed during medically provoked sleep period. We have detected that the data of the same child in subjective and objective <b>audiometric</b> <b>examination</b> were different, and besides, in the group of children at the age from two to 24 months these differences were statistically significant (p< 0. 05), in comparison with older children. That means that it indicates the group of children, where the <b>audiometric</b> <b>examination</b> could play essential role for further set up of rehabilitation strategy. Besides, the objectivized <b>audiometric</b> <b>examination</b> (BERA) allowed to detect precisely the asymmetry of hearing threshold in the age groups. It is interesting to mention that the asymmetry of hearing threshold was the same in left and right sides for the pre-schoolers, but the right side hearing threshold decrease prevailed in school children. It could be an indirect sign of elevation of functional inability of brain hearing centre with the age. The method of BERA of detecting caustically initiated brain stem potentials is evidently more precise and sensitive audiometric method for detection of hearing threshold elevation and asymmetry, specially at early age and thus gives wider possibilities for in due time development rehabilitation and integration in society of children with hearing defectsSeparate summary in Latvian, English, German, 21 p.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to assess the effects of occupational exposure to noise and organic solvents on hearing loss in bus and truck plant workers. Our case control study contained 469 workers from a bus and truck plant divided into three groups. The first group contained workers exposed to only noise; the second group contained workers exposed to both noise and mixture solvents at a permissible level; and the third group included workers exposed to permissible levels of solvents. The control group (Group 4) included 119 individuals selected randomly, persons who were not exposed to noise and solvents. These groups were compared in terms of each individual′s frequency hearing loss in both ears. Our study demonstrates that combined exposure to mixed solvents and noise can exacerbate hearing loss in workers. Hence, a suitable hearing protection program is advised that would contain short-interval <b>audiometric</b> <b>examinations</b> and efficient hearing protectors...|$|R

We examined the prevalence of hearing loss in perinatally HIV+ and HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) children, compared these with the percentage with hearing loss {{in the general population}} and evaluated possible risk factors for hearing loss in HIV+ and HEU children. Methods: <b>Audiometric</b> <b>examinations</b> were completed in children who met any prespecified criteria for possible hearing loss. The hearing examination consisted of a tympanogram in each ear and pure-tone air-conduction threshold testing from 500 through 4000 Hz.

A significantly higher number of patients with panic disorder and chronic dizziness showed pathological neurotologic findings in comparison to subjects with chronic dizziness only (9 and 2 patients, respectively; p < 0. 05). Most patients with panic disorder showed signs of peripheral vestibular disorders. These results suggest that the complaint of dizziness in patients with panic disorder may be linked to a malfunction of the vestibular system and vestibular disorders {{may play a role in}} the pathophysiology of panic disorder.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{investigated}} {{the cause of}} autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) that segregated in 2 consanguineous Iranian families. METHODS: Otologic and <b>audiometric</b> <b>examinations</b> were performed on affected members of each family. Genome-wide parametric multipoint linkage mapping using a recessive model was performed with Affymetrix 50 K GeneChips or short tandem repeat polymorphisms. Direct sequencing was used to confirm the causative mutation in each family. RESULTS: In 2 Iranian families, L- 1651 and L- 8600606, with ARNSHL that mapped to the DFNB 7 / 11 locus, homozygosity for a reported splice site mutation (c. 776 + 1 G>A), and a novel deletion (c. 1589 _ 1590 delCT; p. S 530 *) were identified in the TMC 1 gene, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the previously reported phenotype in DFNB 7 / 11 families, the 2 Iranian families had segregated congenital, profound hearing impairment. However, in family L- 1651, one affected family member (IV: 3) has milder hearing impairment than expected, suggesting a potential genetic modifier effect. These results indicate that DFNB 7 / 11 is a common form of genetic hearing loss in Iran, because this population {{is the source of}} 6 of the 29 TMC 1 mutations reported worldwide...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Otosclerosis is an {{osteodystrophy}} {{disease of}} the bony labyrinth of the ear which leads to stapes fixation and to bradyecoia of a conductive type. The microsurgical treatment {{by the use of}} a stapes prosthesis provides hearing improvement and a reduction or disappearing of tinnitus. The aim of our {{study was to determine the}} hearing condition and tinnitus before and after the treatment of otosclerosis. Material and methods. A hundred patients with otosclerosis, aged 20 to 70, were surgically treated at the Otorhinolaryngology Clinic and the Functional Diagnostics, Military Medical Academy, Belgrade.

40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To {{determine}} the cause of autosomal dominant hearing loss segregating in an American family. STUDY DESIGN: Family study. METHODS: Otologic and <b>audiometric</b> <b>examination</b> was performed on affected family members. Genome wide parametric multipoint linkage mapping using a dominant model was performed with Affymetrix 50 K GeneChip data. Direct sequencing was used to confirm the causative mutation. RESULTS: In American family 467, segregating autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss, a novel heterozygous missense mutation (c. 362 T>C; p. F 121 S) was identified in the COCH gene. This mutation was also associated with vestibular dysfunction typical of other DFNA 9 families. However, affected family members also exhibited memory loss and night blindness. CONCLUSIONS: The novel COCH mutation affects the functionally important limulus factor C, Coch- 5 b 2 and Lgl 1 domain where most DFNA 9 mutations have been localized. The onset of the hearing loss, in the 2 nd or 3 rd decade of life, is earlier than in most DFNA 9 families. The progression of hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction in the American family is typical of other DFNA 9 families with mutations in this domain. Memory loss and night blindness have not been previously reported in DFNA 9 families...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{describe}} the phenotype of 2 Dutch DFNA 3 families with mutations in the GJB 2 gene. METHODS: Two patients from family 1 and one isolated patient from family 2 were studied. The <b>audiometric</b> <b>examination</b> consisted of pure tone and speech audiometry. Two patients underwent vestibular testing and high-resolution computed tomographic scanning {{of the temporal}} bone. Mutation analysis of GJB 2 and GJB 6 was performed. RESULTS: All 3 patients had severe to profound sensorineural hearing impairment. Cochlear implantation was performed in 2 patients, and their phoneme recognition scores were good. Mutation analyses revealed a p. Arg 184 Gln mutation in GJB 2 in family 1 and a p. Arg 75 Trp mutation in GJB 2 in family 2. No mutations in GJB 6 were identified. Vestibular function tests and computed tomographic scans yielded normal findings in the examined subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Severe to profound sensorineural hearing impairment was found in these DFNA 3 patients, and was well rehabilitated with cochlear implantation. A thorough genotype-phenotype correlation is difficult {{because of the small}} number of affected patients and the limited clinical data of these patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of tinnitus along with factors potentially associated with having tinnitus. DESIGN—Data were from the Beaver Dam Offspring Study, an epidemiological cohort study of aging. STUDY SAMPLE—After a personal interview and <b>audiometric</b> <b>examination,</b> participants (n= 3267, ages 21 - 84 years) were classified as having tinnitus if {{in the past year}} they reported having tinnitus of at least moderate severity or that caused difficulty in falling asleep. RESULTS—The prevalence of tinnitus was 10. 6 %. In a multivariable logistic regression model adjusting for age and sex, the following factors were associated with having tinnitus: hearing impairment (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3. 20), currently having a loud job (OR = 1. 90), history of head injury (OR = 1. 84), depressive symptoms (OR = 1. 82), history of ear infection (men, OR = 1. 75), history of target shooting (OR = 1. 56), arthritis (OR = 1. 46), and use of NSAID medications (OR = 1. 33). For women, ever drinking alcohol in the past year was associated with a decreased risk of having tinnitus (OR = 0. 56).

The results {{indicate}} that SOM of extreme duration, and maybe also the treatment of SOM, are risk factors for developing permanent hearing loss, both conductive and sensorineural. Objective. Fluctuating or persisting hearing loss of varying degrees is known to accompany secretory otitis media (SOM). The {{aim of this study}} was to detect possible hearing sequelae in young adults who had suffered from "refractory'' SOM during childhood. Material and methods. A total of 33 subjects (age 16 - 25 years) with previous SOM that had persisted for a mean of 11 years (range 6 - 19 years) were retrospectively examined at a mean of 18 years after their first myringotomy or tube insertion and compared to 15 healthy controls. The follow-up included <b>audiometric</b> <b>examinations</b> (pure-tone audiometry, distorted speech and impedance audiometry), otomicroscopy and scrutiny of medical records. Results. The SOM group had poorer hearing at all frequencies with the exception of 1. 5 kHz in the range 0. 125 - 16 kHz. Those with the greatest number of myringotomies and tube insertions and those with the longest duration of SOM had significantly poorer hearing at high frequencies (8 - 16 kHz) than those with fewer tube insertions and a shorter duration of SOM. The SOM group scored lower on distorted speech tests than the controls...|$|R

A woman aged 24 after dialling {{a phone number}} and putting a phone into the ear heard a sound of high frequency and intensity. At {{the same time she}} felt a pain and heat and there was also a smoke from the phone. With otoscopic examination a burn of external acoustic duct (I 0) and sensitive hearing loss (examination made with tuning forks) were stated. The patient did not agree to stay in hospital and she was administered prednizone, trimetazidin and xantylol nicotinate. <b>Audiometric</b> <b>examination,</b> which was made on another day, showed hearing loss of 30 dB for frequency 4000 Hz.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} further the characteristics of hearing loss in ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunted hydrocephalus. Twelve (VP) shunt treated hydrocephalus children participated in this study. The etiology of the hydrocephalus was either intraventricular hemorrhage or spina bifida. A recent neurological examination reported the shunt to be patent in each child. <b>Audiometric</b> <b>examination</b> included pure tone air conduction thresholds, tympanometry, contralateral and ipsilateral acoustic reflex thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEÊ¹s). A unilateral, high frequency, sensorineural hearing loss was found in the ear ipsilateral to shunt placement in 10 (83 %) of the 12 shunt treated hydrocephalic children. No hearing loss was observed the ear contralateral to shunt placement. Based on the pure tone findings coupled with the decrease in DPOAE amplitude in the shunt ear, the hearing loss appears to be cochlear in nature. It is hypothesized that the cochlear hydrodynamics are disrupted as the result of fluid pressure reduction within the perilymph being transmitted via a patent cochlear aqueduct as a reaction to the reduction of CSF via a patent shunt. In addition, a concomitant brainstem involvement is evidenced in the ART pattern possibly produced by the paten shunt draining CSF from the subdural space resulting in cranial base hypoplasia...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} the audiometric profile of civilian pilots {{according to the}} noise exposure level. METHODS This observational cross-sectional study evaluated 3, 130 male civilian pilots aged between 17 and 59 years. These pilots were subjected to <b>audiometric</b> <b>examinations</b> for obtaining or revalidating the functional capacity certificate in 2011. The degree of hearing loss was classified as normal, suspected noise-induced hearing loss, and no suspected hearing loss with other associated complications. Pure-tone air-conduction audiometry was performed using supra-aural headphones and acoustic stimulus of the pure-tone type, containing tone thresholds of frequencies between 250 Hz and 6, 000 Hz. The independent variables were professional categories, length of service, hours of flight, and right or left ear. The dependent variable was pilots with suspected noise-induced hearing loss. The noise exposure level was considered low/medium or high, and the latter involved periods > 5, 000 flight hours and > 10 years of flight service. RESULTS A total of 29. 3 % pilots had suspected noise-induced hearing loss, which was bilateral in 12. 8 % and predominant in the left ear (23. 7 %).

40|$|Background: There {{is scarce}} {{published}} data on late onset vitiligo. All the studies showing association of audiological abnormalities {{have been done}} on younger age group of patients. Aim: To study the clinical characteristics of the patients with late onset vitiligo. Also, to investigate the audiological abnormalities seen in these patients and compare them with age and sex matched healthy volunteers. Methods: One hundred and ninety-seven consecutive patients developing vitiligo {{after the age of}} 40 were studied. These patients were examined for the audiological abnormalities, and compared with those seen in age and sex matched healthy volunteers. Results: Vitiligo started between 40 and 50 years of age in 68. 02 % of our patients. Vitiligo vulgaris was the commonest clinical pattern, and most patients reported onset of their vitiligo on the upper extremities. Fifty four had diabetes mellitus, 19 patients had autoimmune thyroid diseases, and 32 showed hypoacusis on <b>audiometric</b> <b>examination.</b> Eighteen controls (age and sex matched healthy volunteers) also showed hypoacusis.

40|$|Background: Noise {{exposure}} {{is a well-known}} contributor to work-related hearing loss. Recent biological evidence suggests that exposure to ototoxic chemicals such as organic solvents and heavy metals may be additional contributors to hearing loss. However, in industrial settings, {{it is difficult to}} determine the risks of hearing loss due to these chemicals in workplaces accompanied by excessive noise exposure. A few studies suggest that the effect of noise may be enhanced by ototoxic chemicals. Therefore, this study investigated whether co-exposure to organic solvents and/or heavy metals in the workplace modifies the risk of noise exposure on hearing loss in a background of excessive noise. Methods: We examined 30, 072 workers nationwide in a wide range of industries from the Korea National Occupational Health Surveillance 2009. Data on industry-based exposure (e. g., occupational noise, heavy metals, and organic solvents) and subject-specific health outcomes (e. g., <b>audiometric</b> <b>examination)</b> were collected. Noise was measured as the daily 8 -h time-weighted average level. Air conduction hearing thresholds were measured from 0. 5 to 6 kHz, and pure-tone averages (PTA) (i. e., means of 2, 3, and 4 kHz) were computed. Results: In the multivariate linear model, PTA increment with occupational noise were 1. 64 -fold and 2. 15 -fold higher in individuals exposed to heavy metals and organic solvents than in unexposed individuals, respectively.

SETTING: Loghman Hakim Hospital, Tehran, Iran, 2000 - 2001. SUBJECTS (MATERIALS) AND METHODS: The sample derived from patients who have been introduced to the Audiometric Center of Loghman Hakim Hospital in Tehran, Iran, and underwent an <b>audiometric</b> <b>examination.</b> Among them 100 adult patients (55 males and 45 females) were selected, who suffered from hearing loss. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The patients were clinically examined for TMD signs, and corresponding medical data forms were completed for each one of them. The data obtained included findings of the clinical examination: (a) TMD signs, (b) signs of hearing disorders (hearing loss, tinnitus, ear pain and vertigo), and (c) type of hearing loss (sensory neurotic, conductive, or mixed). RESULTS: Among all patients with hearing loss, 82 patients were found to present TMD. With regard to the outbreak, in patients with hearing loss there is a 95 % possibility to present TMD (min. 75 %, max. 90). The signs of these 82 patients with hearing loss included 89 % hearing loss, 58 % tinnitus, 50 % ear pain, and 42 % vertigo. Out of {{the three types of}} hearing loss, the sensory neurotic type was prevailed.

40|$|Exposure {{of workers}} to {{mixtures}} of organic solvents and to occupational noise is frequent {{in a number}} of industries. Recent studies suggest that exposure to both can cause a more severe hearing loss than exposure to noise alone. Our cross-sectional study included 411 workers of a large automobile plant divided in three groups. The fi rst group included assembly workers exposed to noise alone; the second included workers in a new paint shop, who were exposed to a mixture of organic solvents at a permissible level; and the third group included paint shop workers exposed to both noise and higher than permissible levels of organic solvents in an old paint shop. These groups were compared in terms of low-frequency hearing loss (model 1; average hearing threshold> 25 dB at 0. 5 kHz, 1 kHz, and 2 kHz) and high-frequency hearing loss (model 2; average hearing threshold> 25 dB at 3 kHz, 4 kHz, 6 kHz, and 8 kHz). High-frequency hearing loss was more common in workers exposed to a combination of noise and mixed organic solvents even at permissible levels than in workers exposed to noise alone even after correction for confounding variables. This study shows that combined exposure to mixed organic solvents and occupational noise can exacerbate hearing loss in workers. Therefore, an appropriate hearing protection programme is recommended, that would include short-interval <b>audiometric</b> <b>examinations</b> and effi cient hearing protectors.

40|$|Competing {{theories}} exist {{about why}} asymmetry is observed in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). We evaluated these theories using {{a cohort of}} young workers studied over 16 years. The study aim was to describe and evaluate patterns of hearing loss and asymmetry by gender, agricultural exposure and gunfire exposure. This was a secondary analysis of data collected from young adults during follow-up of a randomized controlled trial. This follow-up study evaluated long-term effects of a hearing conservation intervention for rural students. The sample consisted of 392 of 690 participants from the original trial. In total, 355 young adults (aged 29 - 33 years) completed baseline and follow-up noise exposure surveys and clinical <b>audiometric</b> <b>examinations.</b> Data are displayed graphically as thresholds by frequency and ear and degree of asymmetry between ears (left minus right). In the primary group comparisons, low and high frequency averages and mean high frequency asymmetry were analyzed using mixed linear models. At frequencies > 2000 Hz, men showed more hearing loss, with greater asymmetry and a different asymmetry pattern, than women. For men with documented hearing loss, there was a trend toward increasing asymmetry with increasing levels of hearing loss. Asymmetry at high frequencies varied substantially by level of shooting exposure. While "head shadowing" is accepted as the primary explanation for asymmetric hearing loss in the audiologic and related public health literature, our findings are more consistent with physiological differences as {{the primary cause of}} asymmetric hearing loss, with greater susceptibility to NIHL in the left ear of men...|$|R
40|$|Background:Noise is {{the most}} common hazard in the {{workplace}} and noise induced hearing loss considered to be the most common occupational disease as well. Cigarette smoking, in some studies, has been known to induce hearing loss. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of contemporary exposure to occupational noise and cigarette smoking on hearing. Methods: 478 assembly workers of an automobile plant which were exposed tothe noise more than TLV (threshold limit value) level included in this study. After considering the exclusion criteria, all participants according to the smoking status were divided in smoker and nonsmoker groups and compared for hearing impairment. Hearing impairment in this study was assessed with the offered method of American Academy of Otolaryngology (AAO).   Results :Of 478 assembly workers, 225 persons were smokers and others non   smokers. Prevalence of hearing impairment in smokers was significantly higher (p< 0. 001). Hearing impairment had a significant relation with smoking status even after adjusting for cofounders like age and duration of work (OR= 8. 23, 95 % CI= 3. 63 - 18. 66). Conclusion:The results of this study suggested that cigarette smokers had more hearing impairment than non smokers. According to these results we concluded that in working environments, especially in noisy ones,workers must be encouraged to quit smoking and <b>regular</b> <b>audiometric</b> tests, especially for smokers,must be applied. We must consider not only the noise, but indeed all effective elements of hearing impairment in working environment that could compromise the hearing...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} of this story of case is to describe an uncommon cause of associated peripheral Vestibulopathy to the unilateral auditory loss in aged patient after catheterization of urgency. Story of case: Patient of the masculine sort, 82 years, submitted to the correction of abdominal ragged aneurism of aorta, in the intra-operative suffered heart attack acute from the myocardium needing primary angioplasty. High after hospital it relates to complaint of accented hearing loss {{to the right and}} crippling vertigo, without focal neurological signals. To the otorhinolaryngological clinical examination it presented: Test of Weber lateralized for the left, spontaneous nystagmus for the left, marches rocking, has taken normal disbasia and ataxia, index-nose and diadochokinesia, Test of Romberg with oscillation without fall and Fukuda with lateral shunting line for the right. The <b>audiometric</b> <b>examination</b> evidenced deafness to the right and sensorineural loss to the left in sharps, areflexia initial to the right in caloric test e, the computerized tomography of the secular bones and brainstem, presence of metallic connecting rod crossing the right secular bone, from the vein internal jugular vein and bulb jugular vein, crossing the posterior, superior and vestibule semicircular canals, projecting itself in temporal lobe. The radiological diagnoses was traumatic injury for guide to endovascular metallic during catheterization of urgency and the behavior, considering that the patient had not compensated the balance, it was vestibular rehabilitation. Conclusion: Complaints of giddiness in the aged patient must be closely evaluated of its pathological clinical description because the antecedents of illnesses and previous treatments, in general, direct the diagnostic hypotheses however they can bring unexpected alterations...|$|R
40|$|Objective: There is {{well-documented}} {{evidence in the}} literature concerning a high prevalence of deafness in children with Down syndrome (DS). The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the extent of hearing impairment and address the rehabilitation needs of a Chinese population with DS who were either in special schools or integrated into mainstream schools. Methods: This study screened 92 children with DS at their own schools and 11 were reassessed in the University of Hong Kong Hearing Centre. Hearing status of the children with DS was analyzed on the basis of their screening and reassessment results for tympanometric, transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) and pure tone <b>audiometric</b> <b>examinations.</b> Results: A high point prevalence of hearing impairment (78 % by ears or 90 % by participants) in a Chinese school-aged sample of children with DS was noted. The most common degree of loss was mild to moderate. No significant gender difference, age effect or ear asymmetry was found for tympanometric failure or absence of TEOAE. An unfavorable mean speech intelligibility index score (0. 2) was found for this group of children. Conclusions: Sound field amplification and suitable acoustic modifications to classrooms were recommended for Chinese children with DS in Hong Kong to improve their listening and learning environment. The point prevalence of hearing impairment in older children with DS in this study was in contrast to a previous local study on a younger age group. Further effort is needed to determine the role of possible aging effects on the type and prevalence of hearing impairment in populations with DS. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Objectives The authors had {{a unique}} {{opportunity}} to study the early impacts of occupational and recreational exposures on the development of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in a cohort of 392 young workers. The objectives of this study were to estimate strength of associations between occupational and recreational exposures and occurrence of early-stage NIHL and {{to determine the extent to}} which relationships between specific noise exposures and early-stage NIHL were mitigated through the use of hearing protection. Methods Participants were young adults who agreed to participate in a follow-up of a randomised controlled trial. While the follow-up study was designed to observe long-term effects (up to 16 years) of a hearing conservation intervention for high school students, it also provided opportunity to study the potential aetiology of NIHL in this worker cohort. Study data were collected via exposure history questionnaires and clinical <b>audiometric</b> <b>examinations.</b> Results Over the 16 -year study period, the authors documented changes to hearing acuity that exceeded 15 dB at high frequencies in 42. 8 % of men and 27. 7 % of women. Analyses of risk factors for NIHL were limited to men, who comprised 68 % of the cohort, and showed that risks increased in association with higher levels of the most common recreational and occupational noise sources, as well as chemical exposures with ototoxic potential. Use of hearing protection and other safety measures, although not universal and sometimes modest, appeared to offer some protection. Conclusions Early-stage NIHL can be detected in young workers by measuring high-frequency changes in hearing acuity. Hearing conservation programmes should focus on a broader range of exposures, whether in occupational or non-occupational settings. Priority exposures include gunshots, chainsaws, power tools, smoking and potentially some chemical exposures...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the occurrence of}} hearing loss in children with HIV and its association with viral load, opportunistic diseases, and antiretroviral treatment. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out with 23 HIV-positive children under care at two specialized centers in Jo&# 227;o Pessoa, Para&# 237;ba, Brazil. Their parents or legal guardians responded to a questionnaire, containing data on the clinical situation and the hearing health of the children, who were then submitted to audiological assessment. We complied with the guidelines for human research contained in the CNE (National Education Council) Resolution number 196 / 1996. The findings were analyzed through descriptive statistics. RESULTS: We observed that lamivudine (3 TC) was the antiretroviral drug most used in 17 (94. 4 %) patients, followed by Kaletra (KAL), administered in 14 (77. 8 %) patients, d 4 T in 11 (61. 1 %) patients, and zidovudine (AZT) in 7 (38. 9 %) participants. Otitis was the most frequent opportunistic disease, with 11 (61. 1 %) cases. In the <b>audiometric</b> <b>examination,</b> we observed 39 (84. 8 %) ears with hearing loss and 7 (15. 2 %) normal ears. After the immitance testing, we found five (10. 9 %) normal ears, characterized by type A tympanometric curves. The other 41 (89. 1 %) ears were revealed as altered, with predominance of type B curves in 67. 4 % of the cases. CONCLUSION: There were hearing alterations in children with HIV/AIDS analyzed in this study. Discreet hearing losses were the most occurring. We verified statistically significant associations {{with the use of}} antiretroviral therapy and otitis. Therefore, we point out the importance of auditory monitoring and intervention as soon as possible, thus favoring adequate development in language and decreasing possible difficulties in learning and social inclusion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Vardenafil (Levitra ®) {{represents}} a potent and highly selective phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5) inhibitor, which is established {{for treatment of}} various diseases. There are several unpublished reports from patients stating that vardenafil has a considerable therapeutic effect on their concomitant tinnitus. This pilot {{study was conducted to}} specifically assess the effect of vardenafil in patients with chronic tinnitus. Methods This trial was based on a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design. Fourty-two consecutive subjects with mon- or binaural chronic tinnitus received 10 mg vardenafil (N = 21) or matching placebo tablets (N = 21) administered orally twice a day over a period of 12 weeks. Clinical examination and data acquisition took place at each visit: at baseline, after 4 weeks, after 12 weeks (end of treatment with study medication), and at non-medicated follow-up after 16 weeks. Assessment of clinical effectiveness was based on a standardized tinnitus questionnaire (TQ), the Short Form 36 health survey (SF- 36), audiometric measurements (mode, pitch and loudness of tinnitus; auditory thresholds) and biomarkers of oxidative stress in patients' blood (malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl, homocysteine and total antioxidative status). Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by comparison of subjective and objective parameters with baseline data between both treatment groups (ANCOVA). Results Vardenafil had no superior efficacy over placebo in the treatment of chronic tinnitus during this study. The primary efficacy criterion 'TQ total score' failed to demonstrate significant improvement compared to placebo. Subjective reports of TQ subscales and general quality of life areas (SF- 36), objective <b>audiometric</b> <b>examinations</b> as well as investigated biomarkers for oxidative stress did not reveal any significant treatment effects. The safety profile was favorable and consistent with that in other vardenafil studies. Conclusion Although hypoxia and ischemia play a special role in the pathogenesis of tinnitus, the PDE 5 -inhibitor-induced increase of nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatation exerted no specific influence on tinnitus symptomatology. Considering the unclear risk of rarely associated hearing impairment, systemic application of vardenafil or other PDE 5 inhibitors prove to be not appropriate for therapy of chronic tinnitus. </p...|$|R
