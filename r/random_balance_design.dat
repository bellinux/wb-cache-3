40|$|Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{uncertainty}} and sensitivity analysis techniques. It uses a periodic sampling approach and a Fourier transformation to decompose the variance of a model output into partial variances contributed by different model parameters. Until now, the FAST analysis is mainly confined to the estimation of partial variances contributed by the main effects of model parameters, but does not allow for those contributed by specific interactions among parameters. In this paper, we theoretically show that FAST analysis can be used to estimate partial variances contributed by both main effects and interaction effects of model parameters using different sampling approaches (i. e., traditional search-curve based sampling, simple random sampling and <b>random</b> <b>balance</b> <b>design</b> sampling). We also analytically calculate the potential errors and biases in the estimation of partial variances. Hypothesis tests are constructed to reduce the effect of sampling errors on the estimation of partial variances. Our results show that compared to simple random sampling and <b>random</b> <b>balance</b> <b>design</b> sampling, sensitivity indices (ratios of partial variances to variance of a specific model output) estimated by search-curve based sampling generally have higher precision but larger underestimations. Compared to simple random sampling, <b>random</b> <b>balance</b> <b>design</b> sampling generally provides higher estimation precision for partial variances contributed by the main effects of parameters. The theoretical derivation of partial variances contributed by higher-order interactions and the calculation of their corresponding estimation errors in different sampling schemes can help us better understand the FAST method and provide a fundamental basis for FAST applications and further improvements.

40|$|Special Issue: SAMO 2010 International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a general way to correct a {{positive}} bias which occurs in all the estimators in <b>random</b> <b>balance</b> <b>design</b> method (RBD) and in its hybrid version, RBD-FAST. Both these techniques derive from Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST) and, as a consequence, are faced with most of its inherent issues. And up to now, one of these, the well-known problem of interferences, has always been ignored in RBD. After presenting in which way interferences lead to a positive bias in the estimator of first-order sensitivity indices in RBD, we explain how to overcome this issue. We then extend the bias correction method to the estimation of sensitivity indices of any order in RBD-FAST. We also give an economical strategy to estimate all the first-order and second-order sensitivity indices using RBD-FAST...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{present some}} {{advanced}} techniques {{which can be}} realized with <b>Random</b> <b>Balance</b> <b>Design</b> (RBD) for the computation of variance based sensitivity indices enhancing the precision of the first order effect calculation. The classical RBD method suffers from two classes of problems: 1) the computed values are biased {{with respect to the}} analytical values, 2) the sample design in use is not necessarily exhausting the sample space (i. e., it is unclear if the design is space filling). A freedom of choice in the design of a RBD input sample is given by the choice of the permutations. The standard RBD algorithm uses random permutations. We investigate if a clever choice of these permutation leads to a space-filling design and pays off in terms of numerical precision. Here, the permutations used to create the realizations of the input parameters are constructed from multi-dimensional quasi-Monte-Carlo (QMC) sequences. Those are then called quasi-random permutations...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{sensitivity}} analysis method named Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST). This method {{is known to be}} very robust for the computation of global sensitivity indices but their computational cost remains prohibitive for complex and large dimensional models. Recent developments in the implementation of FAST by use of the <b>random</b> <b>balance</b> <b>designs</b> (RBD) technique have allowed significant reduction of the computational cost. The method is now called RBD-FAST. The drawback of this improvement is that only individual first-order sensitivity indices can be computed. In this article, an extension of RBD is derived for the estimation of any global sensitivity indices of individual factor or group of factors. Several tests are proposed to compare the performances of classical FAST and RBD-FAST...|$|R
40|$|International audiencethree {{methods to}} compute the factors main effect on model {{responses}} are compared. The first one is the improved Fourier amplitude sensitivity test [Tarantola, S., Gatelli, D. and Mara, T. A., 2006, <b>Random</b> <b>balance</b> <b>designs</b> for the estimation of first-order global sensitivity indices. Reliability Engineering and System Safety, 91 (6), 717 – 727. ]. The second one is {{the extension of the}} previous technique to the method of Sobol. At last, an original approach that combines a sampling-based method (Monte Carlo) with iterated one-dimensional fittings is also investigated. In our works, we show that the three methods are able to estimate the factors main effect. On the one hand, the improved FAST and the proposed sampling-based strategy are the less expensive methods as they only require one single sample set of simulation runs. On the other hand, when factors are correlated or an uncertainty analysis is also investigated, the former is the most suited. Besides, it is also demonstrated that the estimates of the main effects with the proposed sampling-based strategy is more robust and is computationally efficient...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare motor {{performance}} in modified pull-up (MPU) and flexed knee push-up (FKPU) tests in young women. Thirty-five apparently healthy women (20. 1 ± 2. 2 years) were submitted to each one of the tests at an interval of 48 hours in a <b>random</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>design.</b> Most individuals performed between 0 an d 10 repetitions (86 %) of the MPU test, and approximately 17 % did not perform even one repetitions. On the other hand, the highest prevalence of outcomes for the FKPUtest was between 16 and 35 repetitions (71 %). The Wilcoxon test identified statistically significant differences (p MPU). A moderate agreement (kappa = 0. 40) was found between the performance in both tests. Negative correlations of low magnitude (r=- 0. 23 to 0. 46) were found between morphological variables (body weight,height, fat mass, and lean body mass) and motor performance in both tests. The results suggest that the FKPU test is presented as a better indicator ofmuscular endurance levels, where as the MPU test seems to better discriminate muscular strength in young women...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Input {{parameters}} {{required to}} quantify environmental impact in {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) can be uncertain due to e. g. temporal variability or unknowns about the true value of emission factors. Uncertainty of environmental impact can be analysed {{by means of a}} global sensitivity analysis to gain more insight into output variance. This study aimed to (1) give insight into and (2) compare methods for global sensitivity analysis in life cycle assessment, with a focus on the inventory stage. Methods: Five methods that quantify the contribution to output variance were evaluated: squared standardized regression coefficient, squared Spearman correlation coefficient, key issue analysis, Sobol’ indices and <b>random</b> <b>balance</b> <b>design.</b> To be able to compare the performance of global sensitivity methods, two case studies were constructed: one small hypothetical case study describing electricity production that is sensitive to a small change in the input parameters and a large case study describing a production system of a northeast Atlantic fishery. Input parameters with relative small and large input uncertainties were constructed. The comparison of the sensitivity methods was based on four aspects: (I) sampling design, (II) output variance, (III) explained variance and (IV) contribution to output variance of individual input parameters. Results and discussion: The evaluation of the sampling design (I) relates to the computational effort of a sensitivity method. Key issue analysis does not make use of sampling and was fastest, whereas the Sobol’ method had to generate two sampling matrices and, therefore, was slowest. The total output variance (II) resulted in approximately the same output variance for each method, except for key issue analysis, which underestimated the variance especially for high input uncertainties. The explained variance (III) and contribution to variance (IV) for small input uncertainties were optimally quantified by the squared standardized regression coefficients and the main Sobol’ index. For large input uncertainties, Spearman correlation coefficients and the Sobol’ indices performed best. The comparison, however, was based on two case studies only. Conclusions: Most methods for global sensitivity analysis performed equally well, especially for relatively small input uncertainties. When restricted to the assumptions that quantification of environmental impact in LCAs behaves linearly, squared standardized regression coefficients, squared Spearman correlation coefficients, Sobol’ indices or key issue analysis can be used for global sensitivity analysis. The choice for one of the methods depends on the available data, the magnitude of the uncertainties of data and the aim of the study...|$|E
40|$|For {{electrically}} stimulated muscles, it {{has been}} observed that maximal muscle force during and after stretch is substantially greater than the corresponding isometric force. However, this observation has not been made for human voluntary contractions. We investigated the effects of active muscle stretch on muscle force production for in vivo human adductor pollicis (n = 12) during maximal voluntary contractions and electrically induced contractions. Peak forces during stretch, steady-state isometric forces following stretch, and passive forces following muscle deactivation were compared to the corresponding isometric forces obtained at optimal muscle length. Contractions with different stretch magnitudes (10, 20, and 30 deg at a constant speed of 10 deg s− 1) and different speeds (10, 20, and 60 deg s− 1 over a range of 30 deg) were performed in triplicate in a <b>random</b> order, <b>balanced</b> <b>design.</b> We found three novel results: (i) there was steady-state force enhancement following stretch in voluntarily contracted muscles; (ii) some force enhancement persisted following relaxation of the muscle and (iii) force enhancement, for some stretch conditions, exceeded the maximum isometric force at optimal muscle length. We conclude from these results that voluntary muscle contraction produces similar force enhancement to that observed in the past with electrically stimulated preparations. Therefore, steady-state force enhancement {{may play a role in}} everyday movements. Furthermore, these results suggest that non-uniformities in sarcomere length do not, at least not exclusively, account for the force enhancement following active muscle stretch, and that the stretch magnitude-dependent passive force enhancement observed here may be responsible for the enhancement of force above the isometric reference force at optimal muscle length...|$|R
40|$|In Machine Learning, a {{data set}} is {{imbalanced}} when the class proportions are highly skewed. Imbalanced data sets arise routinely in many application domains and pose {{a challenge to}} traditional classifiers. We propose {{a new approach to}} building ensembles of classifiers for two-class imbalanced data sets, called <b>Random</b> <b>Balance.</b> Each member of the <b>Random</b> <b>Balance</b> ensemble is trained with data sampled from the training set and augmented by artificial instances obtained using SMOTE. The novelty in the approach is that the proportions of the classes for each ensemble member are chosen randomly. The intuition behind the method is that the proposed diversity heuristic will ensure that the ensemble contains classifiers that are specialized for different operating points on the ROC space, thereby leading to larger AUC compared to other ensembles of classifiers. Experiments have been carried out to test the <b>Random</b> <b>Balance</b> approach by itself, and also in combination with standard ensemble methods. As a result, we propose a new ensemble creation method called RB-Boost which combines <b>Random</b> <b>Balance</b> with AdaBoost. M 2.
