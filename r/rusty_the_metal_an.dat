5000|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{bonds to}} transition metals using [...] "synergistic &pi;* back-bonding." [...] The bonding has three components, {{giving rise to}} a partial triple bond. A sigma bond arises from overlap of the nonbonding (or weakly anti-bonding) sp-hybridized electron pair on carbon with a blend of d-, s-, and p-orbitals on <b>the</b> <b>metal.</b> <b>A</b> pair of π bonds arises from overlap of filled d-orbitals on <b>the</b> <b>metal</b> with <b>a</b> pair of π-antibonding orbitals projecting from the carbon atom of the CO. The latter kind of binding requires that <b>the</b> <b>metal</b> have d-electrons, and that <b>the</b> <b>metal</b> is in <b>a</b> relatively low oxidation state (<+2) which makes the back donation process favorable. <b>As</b> electrons from <b>the</b> <b>metal</b> fill <b>the</b> π-antibonding orbital of CO, they weaken the carbon-oxygen bond compared with free carbon monoxide, while the metal-carbon bond is strengthened. Because of the multiple bond character of the M-CO linkage, the distance between <b>the</b> <b>metal</b> and carbon atom is relatively short, often < 1.8 Å, about 0.2 Å shorter than a metal-alkyl bond. Several canonical forms can be drawn to describe <b>the</b> approximate <b>metal</b> carbonyl bonding modes.|$|R
