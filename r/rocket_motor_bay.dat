5000|$|A pulsed <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> is {{typically}} {{defined as a}} multiple pulse solid-fuel <b>rocket</b> <b>motor.</b> This design overcomes the limitation of solid propellant motors that they cannot be easily shut down and reignited. The pulse <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> allows the motor to be burned in segments (or pulses) that burn until completion of that segment. The next segment (or pulse) can be ignited on command by either an onboard algorithm or in pre-planned phase. All of the segments are contained in a single <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> case as opposed to [...] staged <b>rocket</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{very first}} model <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> {{certified}} was by Model Missiles Inc. (Orville Carslile). Circa 1958. The very first high-power <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> certified was by U.S. Rockets (Jerry Irvine). Circa 1985.

40|$|A {{miniature}} solid-propellant <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> {{has been}} developed to impart a specific motion to an object deployed in space. This <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> effectively eliminated {{the need for a}} cold-gas thruster system or mechanical spin-up system. A low-energy igniter, an XMC 4397, employing a semiconductor bridge was used to ignite the <b>rocket</b> <b>motor.</b> The <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> was ground-tested in a vacuum tank to verify predicted space performance and successfully flown in a Sandia National Laboratories flight vehicle program...|$|R
50|$|The rocket {{consists}} of the warhead and fuse, a thrust stabilising system, a <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> and the tail section. The <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> is a single chamber, solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> with an advanced hydroxy-terminated polybutadine (HTPB) composition rocket propellant. The stabilising fins are folded inside the launch tube and open once the rocket leaves the tube.|$|R
5000|$|To detect {{approaching}} missiles, the <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> of {{the missile}} must be burning - it requires the high effective burning temperatures associated with solid fuel <b>rocket</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Specific impulse is {{also used}} to measure {{performance}} in model <b>rocket</b> <b>motors.</b> Following are some of Estes' claimed values for specific impulses for several of their rocket motors: Estes Industries is a large, well-known American seller of model rocket components. The specific impulse for these model <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> is much lower than for many other <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> because the manufacturer uses black powder propellant and emphasizes safety rather than maximum performance. The burn rate and, hence, chamber pressure and maximum thrust of model <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> is also tightly controlled.|$|R

The rocket of the WS-2 system features four control surfaces in the middle section of the rocket for terminal guidance.|$|R

40|$|Models {{have been}} {{developed}} to predict large solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> acoustic loads based on the scaling of small solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motors.</b> MSFC has measured several small solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> in horizontal and launch configurations to anchor these models. Solid <b>Rocket</b> Test <b>Motor</b> (SRTM) has ballistics similar to the Reusable Solid <b>Rocket</b> <b>Motor</b> (RSRM) therefore a good choice for acoustic scaling. Acoustic measurements were collected during the test firing of the Insulation Configuration Extended Length (ICXL) 7, 6, and 8 (in firing order) in order to compare to RSRM horizontal firing data. The scope of this presentation includes: Acoustic test procedures and instrumentation implemented during the three SRTM firings and Data analysis method and general trends observed in the data...|$|R

50|$|Once ignited, {{a simple}} solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> cannot be shut off, because it {{contains}} all the ingredients necessary for combustion within the chamber {{in which they are}} burned. More advanced solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> can not only be throttled but also be extinguished and then re-ignited by controlling the nozzle geometry or through the use of vent ports. Also, pulsed <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> that burn in segments and that can be ignited upon command are available.|$|R

40|$|Medium lift EELVs {{may still}} {{play a role}} in manned space flight. To be {{considered}} for manned flight, medium lift EELVs must address the short comings in their current boost assist motors. Two options exist: redesign and requalify the solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motors.</b> Replace solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> (SRMs) with hybrid <b>rocket</b> <b>motors.</b> Hybrid <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> are an attractive alternative. They are safer than SRMs. The TRL's Lockheed Martin Small Launch Vehicle booster development substantially lowers the development risk, cost risk, and the schedule risk for developing hybrid boost assist for EELVs. Hybrid boosters testability offsets SRMs higher inherent reliability. Hybrid booster development and recurring costs are lower than SRMs. Performance gains are readily achieved...|$|R
40|$|Several {{combinations}} of solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> and ignition strategies {{have been considered}} for a small Two Stage to Orbit (TSTO) launch vehicle based on a big solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> first stage and cryogenic upper stage propelled by the Vinci engine. In order to reach the target payload performance of about 1400 kg into GTO for the clean version and 2700 to 3000 kg for the boosted version, {{the influence of the}} selected solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> on the upper stage structure has been studied. Preliminary structural designs have been performed and the thrust histories of the solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> have been tweaked to limit the upper stage structural mass. First stage and booster combinations with acceptable general loads are proposed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Rocket</b> <b>motors</b> also employ convergent-divergent nozzles, {{but these}} are usually of fixed geometry, to {{minimize}} weight. Because of the high pressure ratios associated with <b>rocket</b> flight, <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> con-di nozzles have a much greater area ratio (exit/throat) than those fitted to jet engines.|$|R
50|$|Since, {{unlike a}} jet engine, a {{conventional}} <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> lacks an air intake, {{there is no}} 'ram drag' to deduct from the gross thrust. Consequently, the net thrust of a <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> {{is equal to the}} gross thrust (apart from static back pressure).|$|R

50|$|The fire 2 {{commands}} {{cause the}} redundant NSDs to fire through a thin barrier seal down a flame tunnel.

40|$|The next {{generation}} 2. 75 -inch <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> for the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) may require an improved insensitive munitions (IM) response for both guided and unguided rounds. Although the existing 2. 75 ” MK- 66 <b>Rocket</b> <b>motor</b> already utilizes a low vulnerability propellant (Class 1. 3), the employed aluminum <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> case degrades the system’s IM response. An improved IM response may be achieved on the MK- 66 rocket by replacing the metal aluminum <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> {{case with a}} composite material case. The composite <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> case should minimize hazardous metal fragments and vent at a low pressure when exposed to various external stimuli. A previous composite case study was completed several {{years ago on the}} 2. 75 ” <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> on the Non-Development Item (NDI) program. This program utilized a non-detonable propellant with a composite case. Although this program was discontinued, it did show improvements in IM could be achieved. The improvements were seen for bullet impact, fragment impact, fast cook-off and slow cook-off testing. Therefore, the goal {{of this study was to}} utilize the valuable composite case work and determine if these same improvements in IM response could be achieved by utilizing a composite case with the current MK- 66 propellant...|$|R
