40|$|Today, most of {{the load}} of {{electrical}} power system is inductive that has low power factor so that the necessary equipment that can compensate the inductive reactance produced by the load. One of the equipment {{that can be used}} to compensate the inductive reactance is “SAKELAR PEMULIH ENERGI MAGNETIK” / MERS (Magnetic Energy Recovery Switch) which work to regulate the set time of charging and discharging of capacitor by controlling the ignition angle shift of moset gate on the connecting structure of magnetit energy recovery switch. MERS is installed between the voltage source and a single phase induction motor as the load so that it can set the supply voltage to the load. MERS which is used to repair the power factor and it can affect the terminal voltage on the induction motor that can affect the changes in rotation speed of induction motor. Reactance value capacitor will be high when capacitance value of the capasitor is low, reactance value of MERS will be small when the angle shift of mosfet gate bigger. When the <b>reactance</b> <b>valve</b> of MERS the voltage waveform in the capacitor is not-continuous, when reactance value of MERS is equal with reactance value of capacitor its waveform is balance, reacatance value of capacitor is smaller than reactance value of MERS its voltage waveform is dc-offset. The result of study showed that MERS can repair the power factor to 0, 999 and it affects the changes in the terminal voltage of inductive load so tha it effect on the speed of rotation of single phrase induction motor.
