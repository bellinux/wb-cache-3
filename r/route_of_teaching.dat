Researchers agree that the staff in charge with the educational activities within this educational area should have a bachelor degree diploma for the graduation of a higher education institution and should benefit from a thorough psycho-pedagogical training. In the event this initial training level is not reached, the in-service professional development becomes essential to provide the necessary skills to ensure effective care and education services. This column intends to critically review the training <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> this <b>teaching</b> category at the European level, with emphasis on the changes that occured consequently to the need to professionalize the educator, perceived as the main mediator of values, as child’s partner in his evolution.

Data from an ethnographic study of three secondary school geography departments in England are discussed through {{a concept of}} ‘isomorphism’ (homogenising forces), drawn from neo-institutional theory. Similarities across these departments are analysed in terms of coercive isomorphism, including the strong regulatory role played by examination boards and Ofsted; mimetic isomorphism, in which similar approaches are adopted in response to situations of high uncertainty, based on spreading good practice; and normative isomorphism, including the implications of closely guarded educational <b>routes,</b> the professionalisation <b>of</b> <b>teaching,</b> and wider social trends including {{the increasing use of}} Google as a source of knowledge for lessons. It is argued that evidence of homogeneity across spatially separated departments raises interesting questions about teachers’ practice, with implications for departmental and school leadership...|$|R

The unfavorable educational position and less parental support of students at risk make them more dependent <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> quality.

This study examines six aspects <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> quality ((1) safe and stimulating learning climate, (2) efficient classroom management, (3) clear instruction, (4) intensifying and activating the lesson, (5) adaptation <b>of</b> <b>teaching,</b> (6) teaching learning strategies), taking into account teachers’ experience and ethnic diversity in the class. Video analysis of language lessons of 26 primary teachers in segregated classes indicates large differences along the six aspects <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> quality.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} professional training of future psychologists. It is assumed {{that it is possible}} to find an optimal correlation between the acquisition of special knowledge and the formation of personal readiness of psychologists for professional activity. As demonstrated in the article, the character of this correlation depends on the use of a specific method <b>of</b> <b>teaching,</b> and more specifically, the conception <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> oriented towards forming certain personal qualities. For the efficient education of psychologists it is necessary to make a systemic analysis of expected personal changes in the process and as a result <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> them.
