40|$|More {{than one}} species of Agave {{may have been}} {{cultivated}} by ancient farmers in Arizona. The arguments for this include apparent range extensions, burned Agave parts in archaeological roasting features, archaeological sites with in situ agaves thought to be relics of past human management, and limited molecular evidence. The reproductive biology of a single Agave murpheyi Gibson, one of the suspected cultivated species, is documented here in detail. After nine years of growth in a <b>residential</b> <b>backyard</b> in Tucson, Arizona, a flowering stalk rapidly elongated to 4. 73 m (15. 5 ft) during both daytime and nighttime hours from January through May. Daily records kept for much of that time revealed the stalk averaged 4. 69 cm (1. 85 in) of growth per day. Maximum growth spurts correlated with both high daily temperature and mean daily temperature. Lateral branches, eventually totaling twenty-two, began developing during March in the upper portion of the flowering stalk. Over a period of five weeks from late May to late June, these lateral branches flowered with normal-looking flowers, attracted a variety of potential pollinators, but produced no mature fruit. Instead, by the summer monsoon season of July and August, the mother plant had produced 359 miniature agaves or bulbils in these upper side branches. The bulbils appeared to arise from enlargements of tissue {{in the vicinity of}} the former flowers. Without releasing on their own, these bulbils became water-stressed and had to be forcibly removed a year later. By this time they were quite variable in fresh weight and size. Once planted, they rehydrated and immediately began to grow. This single plant shares aspects of bulbil production with three Agave murpheyi plants observed by others...|$|E

40|$|While the {{development}} of land for residential housing along the Swan and Canning Rivers in Perth, WA, Australia has reduced natural mosquito breeding sites, the role of backyard container breeding remains a relatively unknown factor. Local Governments responsible for these areas focus management and control efforts on low lying, tidally driven mosquito habitats to control Aedes vigilax (Skuse) and Aedes camptorhynchus (Thomson) mosquitoes {{in an effort to}} reduce both the nuisance and disease risk to residents. In spite of their efforts, Local Governments continue to receive complaints regarding mosquito nuisance, even when environmental conditions do not favor hatching and development of the two species in the Swan River tidal flats. In this study, 150 backyard inspections were conducted in the residential suburb of Bassendean, Perth, WA, Australia, situated in close proximity to the Swan River tidal plain. The occurrence and species composition of the mosquito fauna found in <b>residential</b> <b>backyards</b> was documented. Of the backyards inspected, 94 % were found to possess containers capable of breeding mosquitoes, although only 3 % contained mosquito larvae. Nine species of mosquito were collected from containers ranging in capacity from 0. 05 to 50 [*]L across the study area. Additionally, encephalitis virus surveillance trapping was conducted within residential properties and compared to the tidally driven natural habitat at Ashfield Flats and a tidally influenced brackish creekline at Bindaring Park. The species composition of the fauna at the three habitat types differed significantly, with Aedes notoscriptus (Skuse) dominating residential lots and A. vigilax more prevalent at the saltmarsh site. Bindaring Park had an adult composition at the mid-point of these two habitats, reflecting its proximity to both the Swan River and residential lots...|$|R
40|$|Background: Tularemia, {{caused by}} a Gram-negative {{bacterium}} Francisella tularensis, is an occasional disease of cats in the midwestern United States and a public health concern due to its zoonotic potential. Different environmental, climatic, and pet-owner's housing and socioeconomic conditions were evaluated as potential risk factors for feline tularemia using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in a retrospective caseâ€“control study. Methods: The study included 46 cases identified as positive for tularemia based upon positive immunohistochemistry, isolation of F. tularensis using bacterial culture, and 4 -fold or greater change in serum antibody titer for F. tularensis. Cats {{with a history of}} fever, malaise, icterus, and anorexia but no lesions characteristic of tularemia and/or negative immunohistochemistry, no isolation of bacteria in bacterial culture, and less than 4 -fold raise in serum antibody titer for F. tularensis were treated as controls (n= 93). Candidate geospatial variables from multiple thematic sources were analyzed for association with case status. Variables from National Land Cover Dataset, Soil Survey Geographic Database, US Census Bureau, and Daymet were extracted surrounding geocoded caseâ€“control household locations. Univariable screening of candidate variables followed by stepwise multivariable logistic modeling and odds ratios were used to identify strengths of variable associations and risk factors. Results: Living in a residence located in newly urbanized/suburban areas, residences surrounded by areas dominated by grassland vegetation, and mean vapor pressure conditions recorded during the 8 th week prior to case arrival at the hospital are significant risk factors for feline tularemia. Conclusions: Prevention strategies such as acaricide applications in <b>residential</b> <b>backyards</b> during spring and early summer periods and any behavior modifications suitable for cats that will prevent them from contracting infection from ticks or dead animals are necessary. Mean vapor pressure conditions recorded during the 8 th week prior to case arrival at a diagnostic facility is a predictor for feline tularemia...|$|R

There were three previous surveys conducted in nearby natural areas. They documented fewer species than were documented here. To understand this better, we examined several specialized groups of moths that tend to use host plants not typically found in an urban residential yard. More species in Schinia HÃ¼bner, Catocala Schrank, Acronicta Ochsenheimer, and Herminiinae Leech were found in this survey than the other local surveys. Only in the Papaipema Smith did we recover fewer species, though it was still above 70 % of what was expected. This diversity could be a result of sampling effort, but it shows that this urban location has a very diverse moth fauna. We suggest that this diversity is partly due to the planting of native plant species in the area about the light trap. Therefore we would concur with others that urban landscapes can be planned to increase biodiversity relevant to more natural ecosystems. In this study we looked at the ratio of the number of species of Geometridae divided by the number of species of Noctuidae as one approach to evaluating the level of disturbance in the moth assemblage. Although the yearly average was nearly constant, the seasonal ratio ranged from 0. 09 to 0. 91 depending on the sampling date. We also calculated alpha diversity and found that seasonal change in alpha diversity greatly exceeded yearly differences. This strong seasonal component means that a comparison between two studies requires a correction for seasonality and similar sampling intervals. In this study, a shift of two weeks would be sufficient to result in a significant difference in alpha diversity. This is the equivalent of increasing temperature by 1. 53 Â°C. Seasonal shifts limit the usefulness of this methodology for environmental assessment because the within season change exceeds the between season change. This problem is compounded when sampling designs interact with this seasonality. In describing our data, we made use of a growing degree day (GDD) model. This approach corrects for simple temperature dependent shifts in moth biology. Consequently, some of the variability in the data was removed, which should improve the power of statistical tests involving survey data. If sampling protocols were based on growing degree days rather than calendar dates, the bias caused by temperature induced shifts in seasonal cycles could be reduced...|$|E

40|$|To {{better control}} populations of {{mosquitoes}} {{and break the}} transmission cycle of vector-borne diseases, {{it is crucial to}} understand the dispersal of adult mosquitoes. We performed a stable isotope mark-capture study, focusing on Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes albopictus, to characterize dispersal distance and behavior. We enriched (i. e. marked) naturally occurring larval mosquitoes in container habitats with 13 C-glucose or 15 N-potassium nitrate at two different locations (~ 0. 5 km apart) in College Station, Texas in 2013. We used 32 CDC light trap, 32 gravid trap, and 16 BG Sentinel at different trap locations within a two-kilometer radius of the enriched larval habitats. Each location was trapped once per week and all mosquitoes collected were identified and numerated. Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. albopictus were pooled and tested for West Nile virus (WNV) by RT-PCR or tested by stable isotope analysis. In total, 720 trap nights were completed from July to August 2013 yielding a total of 32, 140 Cx. quinquefasciatus and 7, 722 Ae. albopictus. Overall, 69 marked female mosquitoes (n= 2, 758) and 24 marked male mosquitoes were captured throughout the study period. This study provides a greater understanding of the dispersal of two important mosquito vectors capable of transmitting diseases in urban environments. We also confirm the ability to use stable isotope enrichment as a means to study the biology of mosquitoes. At the same place and time, we executed a larvicide program targeting habitat containers along public streets and public creeks. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the efficacy of larvicide treatment on adult populations of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. albopictus in a residential area. This study was conducted from June 3 to August 31, 2013 and yielded a total of 42, 714 individuals distributed among 13 different species. Overall, we saw a significant reduction in Cx. quinquefasciatus adult population and no significant reduction in Ae. albopictus adult population, when comparing treated and untreated areas. This study suggests that the majority of container habitat producing these mosquito species were ?cryptic? (i. e. <b>residential</b> <b>backyards)</b> where we did not treat. However, we demonstrate that treating a subset of all container habitat with larvicide can still have a marked reduction in Cx. quinquefasciatus, the primary vector of WNV, suggesting that larvicide is an appropriate component of Integrative Mosquito Management...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that birds select habitat based on {{characteristics}} at multiple spatial scales. Therefore, presence or absence of a species at a site might be influenced by fine scale characteristics, but also features that occur at larger landscape scales. A species 2 Ì† 7 selection criteria may also vary seasonally. An understanding of bird habitat selection may be especially important as increasing urban growth impacts greater areas of land. To learn more about this phenomenon, I used data from a multi-year, citizen scientist study that monitored birds at backyard bird feeders across the U. S. to provide detection histories for 13 species. I used occupancy modeling to determine the influence of land cover types at multiple spatial scales (500 m, 1 km, 3 km, 5 km, and 7 km) on species 2 Ì† 7 probability of occurrence in human altered landscapes (e. g. <b>residential</b> <b>backyards)</b> while incorporating detection probability. At each spatial scale, I built models for each season with low and medium intensity urban percent cover as covariates as well as other land cover types (forest, shrub, etc.), that are previously known to be preferred habitat types for each species. In many cases, the strength and directionality (positive or negative) of habitat preference changed across seasons and spatial scale. This trend was especially apparent in respect to urban land cover types for many species. ^ To understand how future urban growth may impact bird species 2 Ì† 7 presence at bird feeders, I created occupancy models to predict any changes in each species 2 Ì† 7 occupancy probability as the amount of urban land cover increases at decadal increments from 2010 to 2100. Urban growth data was provided by models created using an Artificial Neural Network and a raster modeling environment by Tayyebi et al. (2012). All species were predicted to experience a change in mean occupancy probability across all survey locations. Those species for which mean occupancy was predicted to decline in both winter and spring were primarily found in association with forest habitat. Species whose predicted mean occupancy probability declined in spring, but increased when winter were primarily associated with grassland and cultivated crop land cover. Species that had predicted mean occupancy probabilities which increased in both winter and spring were shown to be positively associated with urban areas in initial models. ^ In light of growing human populations and increasing influence of human development, a refined understanding of habitat preferences {{has the potential to be}} important for urban planning when avian biodiversity is a priority. These results may provide important insights as we contemplate the impact of future human-avian interactions in human altered habitat. While the species included in this study currently have large and fairly stable populations, changes in their occupancy as a result of urban growth may signal concern for less common species that share similar habitats and may decrease the health benefits to the humans who provide food for them. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Effective {{assessment}} of biodiversity in cities requires detailed vegetation maps. To date, most remote sensing of urban vegetation {{has focused on}} thematically coarse land cover products. Detailed habitat maps are created by manual interpretation of aerial photographs, but this is time consuming and costly at large scale. To address this issue, we tested the effectiveness of object-based classifications that use automated image segmentation to extract meaningful ground features from imagery. We applied these techniques to very high resolution multispectral Ikonos images to produce vegetation community maps in Dunedin City, New Zealand. An Ikonos image was orthorectified and a multi-scale segmentation algorithm used to produce a hierarchical network of image objects. The upper level included four coarse strata: industrial/commercial (commercial buildings), <b>residential</b> (houses and <b>backyard</b> private gardens), vegetation (vegetation patches larger than 0. 8 / 1 ha), and water. We focused on the vegetation stratum that was segmented at more detailed level to extract and classify fifteen classes of vegetation communities. The first classification yielded a moderate overall classification accuracy (64 %, Îº = 0. 52), which led us to consider a simplified classification with ten vegetation classes. The overal...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of edges with varying adjacent urban land-use intensities (edge contrast) on arboreal mammal ecology and physiology, using the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) as a case study. It addressed the issue of the impacts of urbanisation on biodiversity with a focus on edge effects. While some species may respond favourably to habitat changes near edges, many forest-dependent wildlife species are negatively affected, with this effect varying among species and intensity of the edge effects. Forest-dependent wildlife, including arboreal mammals, are particularly sensitive to forest-urban edges due to their highly specific habitat requirements and inability or reluctance to cross the urban matrix. Despite the increasing recognition of the effects of urban landscapes, studies investigating the impacts of different types of urban edges (e. g. major roads, minor roads and residential areas) are lacking. Much of the information gained from this research is novel for arboreal and gliding mammals, and indeed for forest-dependent wildlife. This information expands on the current scientific knowledge base and may be used as a reference point for future studies. Information on speciesâ€™ responses to multiple edge types may also be employed by urban land managers and developers to guide effective and scientifically informed urban management. This includes restoration and development decisions and actions for the protection of native wildlife such as the squirrel glider. This study used a number of multidisciplinary methods to investigate the ecological and physiological responses of arboreal mammals to contrasting urban road and residential edges compared to forest fragment interiors. This problem was investigated using the squirrel glider in the fragmented urban landscape of southeast Queensland, Australia. Field based fauna surveys were conducted at twenty-eight sites in fourteen habitat patches. Fauna surveys used live trapping and were repeated seven times over a twelve-month period covering all four seasons from May 2007 until May 2008. Surveys provided information on squirrel glider site use, occupancy and relative abundance, while also enabling radio-collar attachment for assessments of home-ranges and movement, and the collection of biological samples for physiological stress hormone assessments. Habitat surveys were incorporated to provide information on resource and structural changes near edges, together with specific influences on glider abundance, home-ranges and stress. Analysis of variance was used to determine differences in habitat resources and structure in relation to glider site usage in forest fragment interiors compared to road (minor and major) and residential edge habitats (Chapter 2). A mixed effects modelling approach was used to quantify the importance of site-level habitat factors relative to edge contrast and habitat patch size on squirrel glider abundance (Chapter 3). In addition, analysis of variance was used to test for differences in glider age and sex in interior habitats compared to road and residential edges (Chapter 3). Two methods (fixed kernel and minimum convex polygon) were used to determine squirrel glider home-ranges to allow comparisons with other studies, and provide insight into the potential influence of urban edges on squirrel glider movement behaviours (Chapter 4). A linear mixed effects modelling approach clustered by patch was used to determine the influence of edge contrast on squirrel glider physiological stress relative to site-level habitat factors and intraspecific competition (Chapter 5). Forest fragment interiors contained a higher abundance of large trees and nest hollows, together with a greater floristic species richness providing more reliable seasonal foraging sources (nectar and pollen). A higher abundance of these resources may explain the increased likelihood of trapping squirrel gliders (trap success) in these sites. Edge contrast had a strong negative effect on the abundance of squirrel gliders but is conditional on the presence of low numbers of unreliable flowering overstorey trees and the availability of nest hollows at a site. Results also indicated that older male gliders prefer forest fragment interiors over road and residential edge habitats. Squirrel gliders living in interior habitats have larger home-ranges and core areas than individuals living at road and residential edges sites. In addition, squirrel gliders were found to regularly cross narrow roads up to 20 m wide and with a tree gap up to 15 m to access adjacent vegetation. Squirrel gliders were also recorded utilising trees in <b>residential</b> <b>backyards</b> for foraging. Edge contrast was found to have a strong positive effect on squirrel glider physiological stress, however {{as was the case with}} abundance, this was conditional on the availability of habitat features at a site, specifically nest hollows. This thesis makes an important contribution to the current understanding of the responses of a gliding marsupial and forest-dependent wildlife as a group, living near contrasting edges in urban landscapes. On the whole, forest fragment interiors contain higher quality habitat resources allowing squirrel gliders to maintain larger home-range areas and higher abundances, while providing a less stressful environment. Despite this, lower contrast edges, such as minor roads and residential edges, have the capacity to provide sufficient habitat resources (e. g. nest hollows) enabling these sites to support smaller numbers of squirrel gliders. In addition, the availability of these key resources and a decrease in contrast at these edges, reduces the severity of physiological stressors and increases the likely short-term survival of resident individuals. While the importance of forest interiors for conservation is obvious, based on either individual (physiological) or population (abundance) level indicators, this study provides little evidence to suggest that high contrast edges (e. g. major roads) offer any significant conservation value to squirrel gliders in urban landscapes. Conversely, the conservation value of low contrast edges containing key site-level resources should not be underestimated for forest-dependent wildlife, including arboreal and gliding mammals in fragmented urban landscapes...|$|R
