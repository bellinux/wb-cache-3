5|$|Despite {{pressure}} from the Nine Network to adopt the nine dots, NBN Television <b>retained</b> <b>its</b> logo {{for a few years}} after aggregation. However, in 1994, NBN added nine dots into a new logo designed similarly to the Nine Network's, and also began using Nine's on-air promotion, with the NBN logo replacing Nine's. In 1997, the dots were changed to spheres.|$|E
5|$|Fedayeen {{actions were}} cited by Israel {{as one of}} the reasons for its {{launching}} of the Sinai Campaign of 1956, the 1967 War, and the 1978 and 1982 invasions of Lebanon. Palestinian fedayeen groups were united under the umbrella the Palestine Liberation Organization after the defeat of the Arab armies in the 1967 Six-Day War, though each group <b>retained</b> <b>its</b> own leader and independent armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Following Marsh, Ceratopsia has {{usually been}} {{classified}} as a suborder within the order Ornithischia. While ranked taxonomy has largely fallen out of favor among dinosaur paleontologists, some researchers have continued to employ such a classification, though sources have differed on what its rank should be. Most who still employ the use of ranks have <b>retained</b> <b>its</b> traditional ranking of suborder, though some have reduced {{to the level of}} infraorder.|$|E

The pet Pugs were highly valued by Chinese Emperors, and the royal dogs {{were kept in}} luxury and guarded by soldiers. Pugs later spread {{to other parts of}} Asia. In Tibet, Buddhist monks kept Pugs as pets in their monasteries. The breed has <b>retained</b> <b>its</b> affectionate devotion to its owners since ancient times.|$|E
5|$|Italian {{ships of}} Mussolini's navy <b>retained</b> <b>its</b> pre-war scheme of light gray overall for its smaller ships, but the larger units mostly had dazzle {{camouflage}} of dark gray, light sea blue, light sea green and light gray. Italian foredecks had a high-visibility pattern {{of red and}} white diagonal stripes so that their own aircraft would not attack them.|$|E
5|$|P. l. maculatus, {{known as}} the Marozi or spotted lion, {{sometimes}} {{is believed to be}} a distinct subspecies, but may be an adult lion that has <b>retained</b> <b>its</b> juvenile spotted pattern. If it was a subspecies in its own right, rather than a small number of aberrantly coloured individuals, it has been extinct since 1931. A less likely identity is a natural leopard-lion hybrid commonly known as a leopon.|$|E

5|$|The {{events of}} the Dismissal led to only minor {{constitutional}} change. The Senate <b>retained</b> <b>its</b> power to block supply, and the Governor-General the power to dismiss government ministers. However, these powers have not since been used to force a government from office. Kerr was widely criticised by ALP supporters for his actions, resigned early as Governor-General, and lived much of his remaining life abroad.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{increased}} wartime {{manufacturing and}} industrial growth {{ushered in a}} new era of economic prosperity, and Indianapolis's population increased from 8,000 in 1850 to 45,000 at the end of 1864. A real-estate boom led to the establishment of new residential suburbs, but the city <b>retained</b> <b>its</b> slums. Indianapolis also experienced improvements to its public services, such as health care, utilities, street railways, and public schools. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. Construction for the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument began in 1888, in the center of downtown Indianapolis, after decades of discussion. The city's iconic monument was dedicated on May 15, 1902.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} feuding, the Western Railroad {{joined with the}} Boston and Worcester Railroad in 1867 to become the Boston and Albany Railroad (B). The Housatonic Railroad was {{acquired}} by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (NYNH) as its Berkshire Division in 1892, with most service thus running from Danbury rather than Bridgeport. In 1900, the New York Central Railroad (NYC) leased the B, though the latter <b>retained</b> <b>its</b> independent identity for decades after. The B operated a rail yard and roundhouse just north of Union Station.|$|E

5|$|Built between 1117 and 1508, Peterborough Cathedral is {{remarkable}} as the least altered of the Norman cathedrals with only its famous Early English west front, with its later porch and the Perpendicular rebuilding {{of the eastern}} ambulatory by John Wastell being in different styles. J.L. Cartwright wrote of the west front that it is “as magnificent an entrance to a sacred building as could well be imagined.” The long wooden roof of the nave is original and has <b>retained</b> <b>its</b> painting from 1220.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, {{settlements}} {{had been}} established predominantly {{along the lines of}} the existing roads, and the principal villages were Stepney, Whitechapel and Bow. Settlements along the river began at this time to service the needs of shipping on the Thames, but the City of London <b>retained</b> <b>its</b> right to actually land the goods. The riverside became more active in Tudor times, as the Royal Navy was expanded and international trading developed and downstream, a major fishing port developed at Barking to provide fish to the City. These and other factors meant that industries relating to construction, repair, and victualling of naval and merchant ships flourished in the area.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, it {{was decided}} that Oslo and Aker would merge. Ekebergbanen's {{concession}} lasted until 30 June 1947, which was initially extended on year. In March 1948, Oslo Sporveier, the municipal company that operated among other things the street tramways, offered to purchase Ekebergbanen. All but eight shares were sold, and from December the board of Ekebergbanen and Oslo Sporveier was identical. However, the company <b>retained</b> <b>its</b> own name, administration, rolling stock and personnel.|$|E
5|$|For several years, {{between the}} March 1841 arson and 1848, court convened in various private residences. Without a {{courthouse}} in Oregon, the county seat, proposals {{to move the}} county seat began to circulate. Ogle County communities, Byron, Mount Morris, Grand Detour and Daysville were all in contention for the designation, and, ultimately, the new courthouse. At the deciding meeting the representatives from Daysville removed their town from the running and sided with Oregon. The withdrawal of Daysville gave Oregon a slim majority of votes and it <b>retained</b> <b>its</b> status as county seat of Ogle County.|$|E

By the late 2000s, the delays have come and gone and it has emerged as a state route that has been largely modernized to deal with heavy traffic.|$|E
