5|$|In response, Gingrich {{stated that}} he had not quit the race for the Republican nomination, and pointed to his {{experience}} running for 5 years to win his seat in Congress, spending 16 years helping to build a <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in the house and working for decades to build a <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in Georgia. Some commentators noted Gingrich's resilience throughout his career, in particular with regards to his presidential campaign.|$|E
5|$|Again {{unable to}} get his {{expanded}} gambling proposal past the Senate, Beshear attempted to chip away at the <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in that chamber by appointing some Republican senators to lucrative positions in the executive and judicial branches {{in advance of the}} 2010 General Assembly. Shortly after the special session, Beshear named Republican senator Charlie Borders to the state Public Safety Commission. That appointment set up a special election for Borders' seat, which was won by Democratic senator Robin Webb, reducing the <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> to 20–17 with one Independent who usually voted with the Republicans. Following Webb's victory, Beshear appointed Republican senator Dan Kelly to a circuit judgeship, but Republicans held on to that seat in a special election.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, Maloney {{voted to}} reject the Farm Bill. The {{comprehensive}} farm bill failed in the House due largely {{in part to the}} votes of 8 Democratic House members who joined the <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> to vote down the measure.|$|E

50|$|AL: At Large delegates {{are elected}} {{as representatives of}} the whole state. Each state is allotted ten delegates and each {{territory}} six delegates. Each state can {{on top of this}} get bonus delegates based on whether it has a Republican governor, it has <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> in one or all chambers of its state legislature, and whether it has <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> in its delegation to the U.S. Congress, among other factors. With the exception of Missouri all these delegates are allocated at the state level.|$|R

5|$|Flanders's {{voting record}} in the Senate was more {{conservative}} than his senior colleague, George Aiken, and reflected Flanders's business orientation. In his second term, a <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> allowed Flanders to obtain seats on the Joint Economic Committee—this committee acted in an investigatory and advisory capacity to both Houses of the Congress—the Finance Committee and the Committee on Armed Services. These assignments reflected his interests as a senator.|$|E
5|$|During the 1910 midterm {{election}} campaign, Roosevelt involved himself in New York politics, while Taft with donations and influence tried {{to secure the}} election of the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Ohio, former lieutenant governor Warren G. Harding. The Republicans suffered losses in the 1910 elections as the Democrats took control of the House and slashed the <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in the Senate. In New Jersey, Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected governor, and Harding lost his race in Ohio.|$|E
5|$|However, {{because of}} {{political}} infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats, and due to several campaign blunders, the physically ailing Greeley {{was no match for}} Grant, who won in a landslide. Grant won 286 of the 352 Electoral College votes, and received 55.8 {{percent of the popular vote}} nationwide. The President's reelection victory also brought an overwhelming <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> into both house of Congress. Heartbroken after a hard fought political campaign, Greeley died a few weeks after the election. Out of respect for Greeley, Grant attended his funeral.|$|E
50|$|On December 3, 1969, the Court of Appeals did {{not allow}} a re-apportionment of the {{legislative}} districts which the <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> in both Houses intended to enact in time {{to be used for}} the elections in November 1970.|$|R
5|$|Gingrich and the {{incoming}} <b>Republican</b> <b>majority's</b> promise {{to slow the}} rate of government spending conflicted with the president's agenda for Medicare, education, the environment and public health, leading to two temporary shutdowns {{of the federal government}} totaling 28 days.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1866 elections, the Radical <b>Republicans</b> won two-thirds <b>majorities</b> in Congress {{and took}} control of {{national}} affairs. The large <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> made Congressional Democrats helpless, though they unanimously opposed the Radicals' Reconstruction policies. Realizing that the old issues were holding it back, the Democrats tried a [...] "New Departure" [...] that downplayed the War and stressed such issues as corruption and white supremacy.|$|R
5|$|In 1885 the Democrats redistricted the Indiana state legislature, which {{resulted}} in an increased Democratic majority in 1886, despite an overall <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> statewide. In 1887, {{largely as a result}} of the Democratic gerrymandering of Indiana's legislative districts, Harrison was defeated in his bid for reelection. Following a deadlock in the state senate, the state legislature eventually chose Democrat David Turpie as Harrison's successor in the U.S. Senate. Harrison returned to Indianapolis and resumed his law practice, but stayed active in state and national politics.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 {{the state}} Apportionment Board, {{controlled}} by a 32 <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> despite the party's 6138 minority in the state House of Representatives, redrew state legislative districts following {{the results of the}} 1990 Census, in the hope of retaking control of the state House. The new boundaries created nine districts each with two resident incumbent Democrats, pairing Cordray with the twenty-two-year incumbent Mike Stinziano. Unable to be elected in another district due to a one-year residency requirement, Cordray opted not to run for re-election.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{proposed}} by the 104th United States Congress included term limits for Congressional Representatives, tax cuts, welfare reform, and a balanced budget amendment, as well as independent auditing of the finances of the House of Representatives and elimination of non-essential services such as the House barbershop and shoe-shine concessions. Following Gingrich's first two years as House Speaker, the <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> was re-elected in the 1996 election, the first time Republicans had done so in 68 years, {{and the first time}} simultaneously with a Democratic president winning re-election.|$|E
25|$|McDonald {{emphasized}} enhanced fringe benefits. The {{election of}} Dwight Eisenhower as US president and <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> in the United States Congress (at least from 1952 to 1954) made expansion of social programs unlikely, but Eisenhower indeed would extend many of Roosevelt's programs.|$|R
50|$|At the State {{election}} in November 1904, large <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> were elected for a two-year term (1905-1906) in the State Senate, {{and for the}} session of 1905 to the Assembly. The 128th State Legislature met from January 3, 1905, on at Albany, New York.|$|R
50|$|Walker {{took the}} oath of office on December 1, 2014. He faced a Republican-controlled legislature, but the <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> were not enough to {{override}} a gubernatorial veto. With the Republican legislature opposed to Walker's attempts to expand Medicaid, Walker decided to use his executive authority to do so.|$|R
5|$|Sotomayor was {{nominated}} to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by President George H. W. Bush in 1991; confirmation followed in 1992. In 1997, she {{was nominated}} by President Bill Clinton to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Her nomination was slowed by the <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in the United States Senate, {{but she was}} eventually confirmed in 1998. On the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions. Sotomayor has taught at the New York University School of Law and Columbia Law School.|$|E
5|$|The Indiana House of Representatives {{consists}} of 100 members elected to two-year terms. The Speaker of the House for the 2015–2016 term is Representative Brian C. Bosma. In 2015, the House of Representatives has a <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> of 70 seats, while the Democrats have 30 seats. The House offices {{are located in}} the east wing of {{the second floor of the}} Indiana Statehouse and the House chambers are on the third floor.|$|E
5|$|Agnew {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office in 1956, when he sought to be a Republican candidate for Baltimore County Council. He was turned down by local party leaders, but nevertheless campaigned vigorously for the Republican ticket. The election resulted in an unexpected <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> on the council, and in recognition for his party work, Agnew was appointed for a one-year term to the county Zoning Board of Appeals, at a salary of $3,600 per year. This quasi-judicial post provided an important supplement to his legal practice, and Agnew welcomed the prestige connected with the appointment. In April 1958 he was reappointed to the Board for a full three-year term, and became its chairman.|$|E
50|$|In the South, {{there were}} {{numerous}} Republican counties, notably in Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia. Even in Georgia, a state in the Deep South, there were counties returning <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities.</b> This {{was the result of}} an attempt by Republican politicians to heal sectional resentment and make the South competitive.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Kasich formed Recharge Ohio, a {{political}} action committee (PAC) {{with the goal of}} raising money to help Republican candidates for the Ohio House of Representatives and Ohio Senate, in an effort to retain <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> in the Ohio General Assembly. Kasich served as honorary chairman of the PAC.|$|R
50|$|Lincoln's {{preliminary}} Emancipation Proclamation {{was issued}} September 22, 1862. It became the principal issue {{before the public}} in the mid-term elections that year for the 38th Congress. But <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> in both houses held (see 'Congress as a campaign machine' below), and the Republicans actually increased their majority in the Senate.|$|R
5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum {{announced he would}} change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including opposition to the state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Allie Young, {{chairman}} of the state Democratic Party, called a caucus of the Democratic members of the General Assembly to be held on January 1, 1900. As {{a result of the}} caucus, J. C. S. Blackburn was nominated for a seat in the U. S. Senate, Goebel was nominated as president pro tem of the Kentucky Senate, and South Trimble was nominated as speaker of the House. When the General Assembly convened, each Democratic nominee was elected, the party possessing heavy majorities in both houses. Lieutenant Governor Marshall presented a list of committees to the Senate, but that body voted 19–17 to set aside this list and approve a list provided by Goebel instead. Similarly, in the House, the list of committees presented by Speaker Trimble and approved by that body enumerated forty committees, none of them with a <b>Republican</b> <b>majority.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the Fiscal Court's January 1910 meeting, Barkley {{laid out}} an agenda {{to reduce the}} county's debt, improve its roads, and audit its books annually. Despite the <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> on the Court, most of the {{measures}} he proposed during his term were adopted. He appointed a purchasing agent and an inspector of weights and measures for the county and allocated a salary for the county's almshouse keeper instead of relying on fees to fund the position. He replaced the corvée system – wherein residents either paid a tax or donated labor to build and repair county roads – with private contracts. The widening and gravelling of county roads provided rural residents access to Paducah's amenities but reduced funds for programs like free textbooks for indigents and prevented Barkley from reducing the county's debt as planned. When he named his father as the county's juvenile court probation officer, opponents charged him with nepotism.|$|E

50|$|On April 13, 2017, {{with large}} <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> in the Iowa legislature, Branstad {{signed a bill}} into law {{expanding}} gun rights in Iowa, enacting a stand-your-ground law, expanding the right of citizens to sue if they believe their Second Amendment rights are being infringed, and expanding the gun rights of minors, among several other provisions.|$|R
50|$|Bolstered {{by large}} <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> {{in the state}} house, Ogilvie modernized state government. He {{successfully}} advocated for a state constitutional convention, increased social spending, and secured Illinois' first state income tax. The latter was particularly unpopular with the electorate, and Ogilvie lost a close election to Daniel Walker in 1972, ending his career in elective office.|$|R
5|$|In {{the electoral}} college, {{the vote was}} more decisive. As expected, Hancock carried the South and border states, but Garfield swept {{all but one of}} the Northern states (the {{exception}} was New Jersey, which he lost by just two thousand votes). Both candidates carried nineteen states, but Garfield’s triumphs in the more populous North translated into a 214–155 electoral college victory. The sectional divide of the vote more deeply enforced the Republicans' retreat from the South after Reconstruction, and demonstrated that they could win without competing there. Weaver's resistance to fusion had no effect on the result; the combined Democratic and Greenback vote would have carried Indiana, but not any other of the states Garfield won, and the result would still have been a <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in the electoral college. Hancock was convinced that the Republicans won New York by fraud. Lacking evidence, and mindful of the turmoil caused by the disputed election four years earlier, the Democrats did not pursue the matter.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{took office}} on March 4, 1861. Among his first acts was to {{nominate}} Senator Salmon P. Chase of Ohio to be Secretary of the Treasury. Chase resigned his Senate seat on March 7, and {{after two weeks}} of indecisive balloting, the Ohio Legislature elected Sherman to the vacant seat. He took his seat on March 23, 1861, as the Senate had been called into special session to deal with the secession crisis. The Senate that convened {{at the start of the}} 37th Congress had a <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> for the first time, a majority that grew as more Southern members resigned or were expelled. In April, Sherman's brother William visited Washington to rejoin the army, and the brothers went together to the White House to meet Lincoln. Lincoln soon called for 75,000 men to enlist for three months to put down the rebellion, which William Sherman thought too few and too short a duration. William's thoughts on the war greatly influenced his brother, and John Sherman returned home to Ohio to encourage enlistment, briefly serving as an unpaid colonel of Ohio Volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Political party {{strength}} in Virginia has likewise been in flux. In the 2007 state elections, Democrats regained {{control of the}} State Senate, and narrowed the <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> in the House of Delegates to eight seats. Yet elections in 2009 resulted in the election of Republican Bob McDonnell as Governor by a seventeen-point margin, {{the election of a}} Republican Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General, as well as Republican gains of six seats in the House of Delegates. In 2011, the Republican caucus took over two-thirds (68–32) of the seats in the House of Delegates, and a majority of the Senate based on the Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling as the tie-breaker. Following the 2013 elections, Democrat Terry McAuliffe was elected Governor by two percentage points, and Democrat Ralph Northam was elected Lieutenant Governor by double digits. Republicans, however, maintained their super-majority (68–32) in the House of Delegates. State election seasons traditionally start with the annual Shad Planking event in Wakefield.|$|E
