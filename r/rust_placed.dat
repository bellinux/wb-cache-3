40|$|This is {{the first}} report {{of the results of}} the series of {{experiments}} which have been carried on by the authors from December 1978 to February 1979. This series of experiments, named Experiments 6, aimed to determine the threshold values of NaCl concentrations in concrete for steel bar rusting. A method of electrical potential difference measurements of spots of concrete specimen surfaces over Cu/CuSO_ 4 half cell, having been developed by California Division of Highways and having been widely used to detect the rusting spots of steel bars in concrete, are also performed in this series of experiments. We planned to examine the method, if it can be applicable to the RC structures in Okinawa Prefecture to detect rusting spots. The following results about steel bar corrosion are obtained by and at six months after embedding steel bars in concrete. 1. Steel bars in the concrete contained 0. 033 % of NaCl have not corroded yet without adding any amount of corrosion inhibitors. 2. Steel bars in the concrete contained 0. 067 % of NaCl do not also corrode yet, if adequate amount of corrosion inhibitors are added to the concrete. 3. In case of the concrete contained 0. 100 % of NaCl by weight, there have been steel bars corroded some, but their areas of corrosion were small. Some of the steel bars have no corrosion spots where adequate amount of corrosion inhibitors had added to the concrete. 4. All steel bars in the concrete contained 0. 133 % of NaCl by weight except A_ 4 D_ 2 C_ 2 O_ 1 specimens have been observed some corrosion. And as the time has passed, the areas of corrosion on steel bar surfaces are becoming larger. 5. There have not been any significant differences in the effects of types of corrosion inhibitors on steel bar corrosion. 6. The effects of water-cement ratio on corrosion of steel bars are not obvious. 7. The beneficial effects of doubled dosage of corrosion inhibitors into concrete are observed on steel bar corrosion. The results of electrical potential measurments on the basis of Cu/CuSO_ 4 half cell are as follows. 1. It has not been decided yet that the standards of California Division of Highways on steel bar corrosion in concrete can be applicable to the RC structures in Okinawa Prefecture. 2. Steel bars in concrete need not be connected by metalic means each other when half cell potential measurment method is applied. 3. Rusting spots on steel bar surfaces have high potentials, and the electrical circuit directly contained a rusting spot exhibit high potentials in the sense of absolute value. 4. Almost <b>rusting</b> <b>places</b> have occured in the underside of steel bars, and the underside of the specimen has considerable larger cover depth over steel bars than the upperside. The electrical potentials measured on the underside of a specimen were always higher than on upperside. 5. Moisture condition of the specimen concrete has strong effect on measured potential values. 6. There have been no corrosion on the steel bars in the specimens which exhibit 0. 2 volt or less of electrical potential. 7. There have been very few specimens which exhibit the electrical potential value of 0. 3 volt or higher. 8. The almost specimens having corroded steel bars at 3 or 6 months after embedding exhibit 0. 20 to 0. 30 volt higher on the basis of Cu/CuSO_ 4 half cell...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{formation}} of Fe n,m hydmxy salts (green rusts) from Fe n sulphate and chloride solutions and their transformation to lepidocrocite, 7 -FeOOH, was studied at ambient temperature, constant pH of ~ 7. 0 and under controlled air flow. The {{formation of}} green rust and its subsequent transformation to lepidocrocite could be distinguished by the reaction rate and solution chemistry. The SO 4 2 - and CI- concentrations in solution attain a minimum {{at the break}} between the two reaction steps and are completely restored to their initial values after complete transformation to lepidocrocite. While the green rust is being formed, its FeU/FO n ratio shows a minor decrease and its Fern/anion ratio a minor increase. These ratios, however, deviate from the ideal pyroaurite-type structure (M 2 +/M 3 + = 3; M 3 +/A = 1; M: metal; A-: anion) and possibilities to accommodate this deviation are discussed. A period during which no protons were produced (i. e. no base consumed) was found to separate the two reactions in the chloride, {{but not in the}} sulphate system. During this period a partial solid state oxidation of the green <b>rust</b> took <b>place,</b> leading to its destabilization and eventual decomposition. Green-blue iron hydroxide compounds occur under reducing and weakly acid to weakly alkaline conditions as intermediate phases in the formation of Fe oxides (goethite, lepidocrocite, magnetite). Because these green compounds were first discovered in conjunction with corrosion of steel in earth surface environments, they were called green rusts. Their well-known structure is of a pyroaurite type. It consists of sheets of Fen(OH) 6 octahedra (called hydroxide layer in this article) in which some of the Fe n is replaced by Fe m, creating a positive layer charge which is balanced by anions located between the layers (Feitknecht & Keller, 1950; Bernal et al., 1959; Stampfl, 1969; Brindley & Bish, 1976). Chloride and sulphate are the most common interlayer anions, but a carbonate form of green rust als...|$|R

40|$|Transport of {{hydrocarbons}} from reservoir to {{gas processing}} plants and for supply to delivery terminals is predominantly done using pipelines, particularly within reasonable distance. In the North Sea of Norway, {{there are about}} 8000 km network of pipelines transporting hydrocarbons. Transport and processing operations of hydrocarbons in the North Sea are typically at elevated pressures. The seafloor temperatures are normally low; because of the seawater salinity {{it could be as}} low as 272. 15 K in the northern part, and seldom rise above 279. 15 K in the south. If liquid water condenses out of hydrocarbon gas streams at these conditions of high pressures and low temperatures, with favourable mass and heat transport, nucleation and growth of natural gas hydrate is expected to occur. The typical technique the industry currently apply to examine the risk of hydrate formation is based on estimation of water dew-point for the gas in question. And if any condition of temperature and pressure in the pipeline or processing equipment is above water dew-point so that water condenses out, then the amount of water that will drop out is evaluated. This is followed by hydrate formation evaluation, including maximum amount of hydrate that can be expected to form from the condensed water. Prevention of hydrate formation with this classical approach known as dew-point method therefore involves estimating the maximum amount of water that can be permitted in the hydrocarbon gas without the risk of liquid water dropping out and eventually leads to hydrate formation. The shortcoming of the classical scheme is that it totally disregards another (a new) concept which involves water dropping out of the bulk through the mechanism of adsorption on rusty surfaces. Pipelines and some equipment are generally rusty even before they are mounted together and put in <b>place.</b> <b>Rust</b> is a mixture of iron oxide and in this study refers to Hematite (Fe 2 O 3) {{which is one of the}} most thermodynamically stable forms of rust. These rusty surfaces provide water adsorption sites that can also lead to hydrate formation. However, hydrate formation cannot occur directly on the surfaces covered by Hematite. This is because the distribution of partial charges of hydrogen and oxygen in the lattice are incompatible with the atom charges in the rusty (Hematite) surfaces. But the rusty surfaces act as catalyst that help to take out the water from the gas stream via the process of adsorption, and hydrate formation can follow slightly outside of the first two or three water layers of about one nanometre. In this project, real hydrocarbon mixtures are studied for the first time using a novel thermodynamic scheme, with composition data which is openly available for the Troll gas and Sleipner gas from the North Sea. The model has been comprehensively validated in this work for pure and mixtures of hydrocarbons, CO 2, H 2 S, and hydrocarbon mixtures with these inorganic gases with experimental data from 35 established literature. Estimates of maximum concentration of water tolerable in hydrocarbon gas systems containing structure I and structure II guest molecules during processing and pipeline transport with the classical dewpoint technique is in order of 18 - 21 times higher than the estimates with the new concept of evaluating the risk of hydrate formation based on water dropping out by the process of adsorption on Hematite. This alternative route to hydrate formation through adsorption of water on hematite absolutely dominates in evaluating the risk of water dropping out from the gas mixtures (and pure components investigated) to form a separate water phase and eventually lead to hydrate formation. This reason is because the average chemical potential of the water adsorbed on Hematite is approximately 3. 4 kJ/mol less than the chemical potential of liquid water. And thermodynamics favours minimum free energy. The typical trend exhibited by methane, methane-dominated gas mixtures like Troll gas and Sleipner gas, and carbon dioxide is decline in the upper limit of water with increasing pressure. The heavier hydrocarbon (ethane, propane, and isobutane) gases exhibits opposite trend to that of CH 4 and CH 4 -dominated gas mixtures where the permitted maximum water content increases with increase in pressure. This manifestation is due to the high density nonpolar phase at the high pressures of the C 2 +. The non-polar heavier hydrocarbons (especially of structure II hydrate formers) will act to draw down the maximum concentration of water that can be permitted in the gas mixture to a point where they completely dominate or dictate the trends. This is why the safe-limit of water tolerable in Sleipner gas is lower than that of Troll gas which contains lesser amount of C 2 +. The safe-limit of water to prevent the risk of hydrate formation during processing and pipeline transport of CO 2 is only very slightly less than that CH 4. Higher concentrations of H 2 S up to 5 % and above would have a significant impact of reducing the maximum concentration of water that can be permitted in hydrocarbon gas mixtures during processing and pipeline transport operations...|$|R
