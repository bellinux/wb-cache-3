40|$|The mean radiant {{temperature}} (m. r. t.) {{is usually}} assessed as the radiation received at a point (or by a small sphere), but it is clearly important to know how adequately this parameter describes the heat load on a man, for {{in the presence of}} hot surfaces his shape and orientation may have significant effects. This paper presents the results of experiments designed to assess the radiant heat received by a man in a controlled temperature room in which non-uniform environments were achieved by locating a heated panel either overhead or on one wall. The m. r. t. was determined with reference to a point using (a) the solid angle and temperature of each surface of the room, (b) a <b>radiation</b> <b>thermopile,</b> and (c) a globe thermometer. The m. r. t. was also determined with reference to (a) a cylinder 68 in. in height and 12 in. in diameter, and (b) models of standing and sitting men. It seems that in indoor environments, where there is no intense radiation from sharply localized sources, the single estimation of m. r. t. with a globe thermometer at 45 in. above the floor will generally give a satisfactory indication of the heat load on a standing or sitting man...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the use of SIMOX {{substrates}} for fabrication or IR <b>radiation</b> <b>thermopiles</b> by CMOS technology. SIMOX technology enables the fabrication of single-crystal leads on thin silicon or silicon oxide membranes. Two p-type silicon/aluminium thermopiles on different membranes are presented. A thermopile with a 4 fm thick, epitaxially grown silicon membrane has a responsivity of 18 V/W and a time constant of 3 ms. Using a 2. 5 fm thick silicon oxide membrane, a responsivity of 150 V/W and a time constant of 25 ms are achieved. In addition, the fabrication and properties of an IR absorber made in CMOS technology are presented...|$|R
40|$|Figures {{of merit}} {{condensing}} the performance parameters of radiation sensors such as responsivity, noise equivalent power, and time constant {{in a single}} number can be useful for rating {{the performance of a}} particular sensor in comparison to other ones or to fundamental performance limits. The classification system and the figures of merit of radiation sensors introduced by R. C. Jones are revisited for thermal radiation sensors with the focus on thermopiles and bolometers. As a result it is stated that <b>radiation</b> <b>thermopiles</b> and bolometers should be classified differently: type III detectors for thermopiles vs. type II detectors for bolometers. Modified figures of merit are suggested and relations between them given. The figures of merit are applied in an overview on state-of-the-art thermopiles and bolometers operated at room temperature...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{formulas}} for {{the design}} of <b>radiation</b> <b>thermopiles</b> to be used with a Thomson galvanometer are summarized and new formulas {{for the design}} of thermopiles for use with D'Arsonval galvanometers are developed. A design of thermopile is described in which the cold junctions almost entirely surround the hot junctions thus reducing drifts. In this design, each element is constructed as a separate unit and when all are completed they are simply stacked up and fastened together with one screw, thereby minimizing the danger of breakage. The whole thermopile fits into a cubical evacuated case only 10 mm on an edge and, being so small, it can be used directly in front of an elliptical mirror which forms a small hot image, in some cases increasing the deflection due to a given radiation by a factor of 3. By a slight modification of the spectrometer, a thermopile having adjustable compensation can be utilized which, theoretically, will give almost no drifts due to changes in temperature of the optical parts of the spectrometer or of the surroundings. A convenient technique of construction is described...|$|R
50|$|Rubrobacter xylanophilus is a {{thermophilic}} {{species of}} bacteria. It is slightly halotolerant, short rod- and coccus-shaped and gram-positive, with type strain PRD-1T. It {{is the only}} true <b>radiation</b> resistant <b>thermopile.</b> It can degrade xylan and hemicellulose. The first strain of the genus Rubrobacter was isolated from gamma-irradiated hot spring water samples by Yoshinaka. This organism {{was found to be}} extremely gamma-radiation resistant, with a higher shoulder dose than the canonical radiation resistant species of the genus Deinococcus. The organism stained Gram-positive and was slightly thermophilic with an optimum growth temperature of about 45°C.|$|R
40|$|Thermopile {{pyrometer}} modules are {{the state}} of the art for contactless temperature measurement in automotive applications. Here sensors have to operate precisely in a challenging thermal environment. While the compensation of the steady state ambient temperature is a well known technique in <b>thermopile</b> <b>radiation</b> temperature sensors, transient thermal effects are still an issue. The change of the ambient temperature as well as temperature flow through the sensor can lead to substantial errors due to unwanted thermal gradients within the device. In the thermopile chip they leads to an error signal since the measurement principle is based on quantifying thermal gradients of the chip that result from the detected IR-radiation. Thermal gradients in the cap and between cap and thermopile chip lead to an exchange of heat <b>radiation</b> between <b>thermopile</b> chip and cap that is erroneously detected and thus also leads to errors. Different methods were developed that separately or in combination allow for a significant improvement of the accuracy and signal stability. The methods are based on the reduction of thermal gradients within the thermopile chip and the entire sensor device (isothermal, high thermal mass cap), reduction of radiation exchange between the sensor chip and the housing (low emissive inner cap surface) and prediction and software compensation of the error signal...|$|R
50|$|He became {{interested}} in astronomy and travelled to Oran in 1870 to photograph the solar eclipse. In 1871 he acquired a reflecting telescope of 12 inches (30.5 cm) aperture and set {{it up in a}} dome in the gardens of Daramona House. He used it to experiment on the photography of the moon with wet plates and also began to study solar <b>radiation</b> using <b>thermopiles.</b> In 1881, he replaced the original telescope with a Grubb reflector of 24 inches (61 cm) aperture and a new dome and mounting that had an electrically controlled clock drive. The new telescope was mounted in a two-storey tower attached to the house with an attached physical laboratory, darkroom and machine shop.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} design {{methodology}} and CAD tools for microsystems fabrication {{based on the}} 1. 0 mm CMOS process from ES 2. In order to profit from vendor cell libraries, tools have to enhance their own design kit. Main contributions are, sensor dependent technology file, device modeling and automatic generation for different ranges, and adaptation of semi-custom tools (simulation environment and P&R) for complete microsystems design. Introduction A library of dedicated sensor standard cells is being designed using the commercial framework (Cadence DFWII) and the foundry design kit. These sensor cells are fabricated with the standard CMOS process plus some post-processing steps.
