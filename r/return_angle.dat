50|$|The Suzuki-gun <b>return</b> <b>angle</b> {{resulted}} in The New Beginning in Sapporo also featuring other prominent matches featuring the stable. On January 4, 2017, at Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome, Tomohiro Ishii and Toru Yano forced {{their way into}} the IWGP Tag Team Championship match, originally scheduled between champions Guerrillas of Destiny (Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa) and challengers Great Bash Heel (Togi Makabe and Tomoaki Honma), and then proceeded to win the match to become the new champions. G.B.H., who were not involved in the pinfall that decided the match, remained in position to challenge for the title. The following day, both Chaos' Ishii and Yano as well as G.B.H. were part of the group of wrestlers attacked by the returning Suzuki-gun stable. During the attack, Suzuki-gun's designated heavyweight tag team Killer Elite Squad (Davey Boy Smith Jr. and Lance Archer) targeted Ishii and Yano, and afterwards declared themselves the true IWGP Tag Team Championship, stating that they would regain the title in their first attempt. On January 10, NJPW announced a three-way match between Chaos and Yano, G.B.H. and K.E.S. for The New Beginning in Sapporo. The same three teams were scheduled to face off in another three-way title match six days later at The New Beginning in Osaka. The Sapporo event would also feature a third title match involving members of the returning Suzuki-gun stable with Taichi and Taka Michinoku challenging Chaos' Roppongi Vice (Beretta and Rocky Romero) for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. This also stemmed from the January 5 attack, during which the challengers had targeted the champions. Taichi and Michinoku previously held the title in November 2013.|$|E

These elevation angles allow the altitude of the reflection {{point to be}} estimated, an essential piece of information for many ionospheric studies. The elevation angle calculation requires knowledge of the azimuthal <b>return</b> <b>angle.</b> This directional angle is usually assumed to lie along a narrow beam {{from the front of}} the radar, even though the signals are known to return from both in front of and behind the radar. If the wrong direction of return is assumed, large uncertainties will be introduced through the azimuthal <b>return</b> <b>angle.</b> This paper introduces a means of automatically determining the correct direction of arrival and the propagation mode of backscatter. The application of this method will improve the accuracy of backscatter elevation angle data and aid in the interpretation of both ionospheric and ground backscatter observations.

While ev- erybody is getting more and more familiar with the charms of handheld tablets and their very intuitive input method, there is still a world of desktop computers, game con- soles and other devices that are not handheld and need to be controlled from a certain distance. The Rovaniemi University of Applied Sciences is located in the capital city of Lapland, Finland 2 ̆ 7 s northernmost region. Its Information Technology department has a laboratory, pLAB, where students and employers work on various projects, ranging from research for the university to complete products for the university 2 ̆ 7 s clients. We are two of the students working in this laboratory, doing research on some new (and not so new) input technologies: the CyberGlove (by CyberGloveSystems) and Microsoft 2 ̆ 7 s Kinect. The CyberGlove is a glove with a number of sensors which <b>return</b> <b>angle</b> values to the computer it is connected to. Based on these values, it is possible to construct a visual presentation of the hand. Kinect is a combination of an infra-red transmitter/receiver and a regular RGB camera, which are used to capture full body movements. Because Kinect is not accurate enough to recognize exact angles of a hand 2 ̆ 7 s joints, the university has asked us to experiment with collaboration between the two. Additionally, we are combining Kinect and the CyberGlove with the Unity 3 D engine. The reason for this research is fairly basic: the university currently owns a very old and slightly broken CyberGlove device, and is thinking of buying a new one. Buying such a device would cost tens of thousands of euros, so they want to be absolutely sure whether this would be worth it. The aim of the project is to decide whether the CyberGlove, in combination with Kinect and Unity, can be a useful asset in future projects. This paper is where we describe our ndings...|$|E

In this paper a clustering analysis is performed to classify shovel digging effort and behaviour based on digging energy, dig time and payload per pass. Then the influence of the operator on the digging efficiency and productivity of the machine is analyzed with a focus on operator technique during digging. A statistical analysis is conducted on different cycle time components (dig time, swing time, return time) for different operators. In addition to time components, swing and <b>return</b> <b>angles</b> as well as loading rate and mucking rate are observed and analyzed.

5000|$|Gasquet is an all-court player, {{known for}} his {{complete}} and classy game {{as well as his}} single-handed backhand, which is considered {{to be one of the}} best ever. His forehand is his weaker wing, and is generally less consistent and slower. For his forehand, Gasquet uses a semi-western to Eastern grip with an unusually long take-back. However, upon contact, he hits the ball flat with an eastern grip while flicking his wrist, seemingly combining flat and topspin strokes together. However, it is due to this that his forehand is considered [...] "awkward" [...] and is weaker. On the other hand, his single-handed backhand is considered one of the most graceful, efficient and effective backhands ever. Like his forehand, he winds up his backhand very far backwards, his left hand supporting the take-back. Upon release, he flicks his wrist as well and produces a large follow-through and finish, executing one of the most deadly top-spin single-handed backhands. His backhand is known for its consistency, speed and impeccable accuracy, and has been widely acclaimed by many pundits and past players such as Robbie Koenig, John McEnroe and Brad Gilbert. His ability to generate massive pace on his backhand, even from far behind the base line, coupled with the amount of top-spin he uses produces problems for many players. When <b>returning</b> <b>angled</b> shots to his backhand, he demonstrates both power and control, hitting them with a lot of angle. He is also known to hit flat returns on high top-spin shots directed to his backhand, a shot most single-handed backhand players struggle with.|$|R

In brief, the reflectance spectrum at each pixel can be represented as a point in n-dimensional space where n {{is the number of}} spectral bands in the spectral region being analyzed. A vector can be drawn from the spectrum point through the origin. The spectral angle mapper (SAM, ENVI Software) routine <b>returns</b> the <b>angle</b> between the spectra of each pixel in the image cube and the reference spectrum.

Typical threshold angle values (i.e. the values below which a “close match” is assigned) ranged from 0.02 to 0.12 radians. Such maps can be compared with the XRF elemental maps in order to assign pigments to them. Note, the limiting angle is found to vary for each reflectance spectrum mapped.|$|R
