500|$|The New York Times writer John O'Connor {{praised the}} acting and {{originality}} of the series, {{which he called}} [...] "simultaneously funny and harrowing". He also said Homicide occasionally gratuitously emphasized style over substance {{in an attempt to}} be original, [...] " [...] trying to signal, 'See how much better we are than ordinary television.'" [...] Many commentators were impressed with the high number of strong, complex, well-developed and non-stereotypical African American characters like Pembleton, Lewis and Giardello. When the show risked facing cancellation due to poor Nielsen ratings, Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, took what was considered an unusual move and wrote a letter to NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield urging the network not to cancel Homicide. Hooks said the show presented many positive portrayals of African Americans, as well as [...] "a compelling and <b>realistic</b> <b>rendering</b> of today's multiracial and multicultural urban society".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the field}} of <b>realistic</b> <b>rendering,</b> Japan's Osaka University {{developed}} the LINKS-1 Computer Graphics System, a supercomputer that used up to 257 Zilog Z8001 microprocessors, in 1982, {{for the purpose of}} rendering realistic 3D computer graphics. According to the Information Processing Society of Japan: [...] "The core of 3D image rendering is calculating the luminance of each pixel making up a rendered surface from the given viewpoint, light source, and object position. The LINKS-1 system was developed to realize an image rendering methodology in which each pixel could be parallel processed independently using ray tracing. By developing a new software methodology specifically for high-speed image rendering, LINKS-1 was able to rapidly render highly realistic images. It was used to create the world's first 3D planetarium-like video of the entire heavens that was made completely with computer graphics. The video was presented at the Fujitsu pavilion at the 1985 International Exposition in Tsukuba." [...] The LINKS-1 was the world's most powerful computer, as of 1984. Also in {{the field of}} <b>realistic</b> <b>rendering,</b> the general rendering equation of David Immel and James Kajiya was developed in 1986 - an important step towards implementing global illumination, which is necessary to pursue photorealism in computer graphics.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the third}} Infinity Blade title was {{completed}} in September 2013, Chair was looking to return to Shadow Complex but a new opportunity came about as Apple had introduced Chair to Bad Robot, the production company of film and television director J.J.

During 2015 as Spyjinxs development continued, Mustard recognized that Chair had grow large and mature enough to handle a second project. He opted to have part of his team create Shadow Complex Remastered, using the help of a friendly third-party studio to help port the game to the Unreal Engine 4, giving the game more <b>realistic</b> <b>rendering</b> capabilities enabled {{by the nature of the}} original game assets being developed at high resolution. Chair included keyboard and mouse controls for personal computer users and added in new melee takedown maneuvers, as these were already featured developed for the anticipated sequel.

As we {{are better able to}} simulate the real world, we can usefully perform more research in simulated environments. The key aspects of a good simulator, an accurate physics simulation and <b>realistic</b> graphical <b>rendering</b> system, are also central to modern computer games. In this paper, we describe a robot simulation environment built from technologies typically used in computer video games. The simulator is capable of simulating multiple robots, with <b>realistic</b> physics and <b>rendering.</b> It can also support human-controlled avatars using a traditional first-person interface. This allows us to perform robothuman interaction and collaboration studies in the simulated environment. The distributed nature of the simulation allows us to perform large-scale experiments, with users participating from geographically remote locations. I...|$|R

Real-time <b>rendering</b> of scenes illuminated by environmental lighting, is beneficial in many applications such as lighting/material design, animation, and games. For photorealistic rendering under environmental lighting, the triple product of the environmental lighting, the BRDF, and the visibility function is integrated. Integrating the triple product is computationally expensive and this prevents from real-time rendering under all-frequency environment lighting. To address this, we propose an efficient rendering method for scenes illuminated by all-frequency environmental lighting. Our method uses spherical Gaussian (SG) functions to efficiently integrate the triple product...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} three {{experiments}} performed {{to examine the}} effects of different visualization techniques of 3 D computer-generated freeform surfaces on subjects' perceptual and cognitive performance while doing CAD-related activities in an immersive VR system. Experimental perceptual and cognitive tasks included depth size estimation of a single 3 D object (exp. 1), estimation of depth differences between two 3 D objects (exp. 2) and mental rotation of 3 D objects (exp. 3). Dependent variables were accuracy (exp. 1, 2 and 3) and response time (exp. 3). The visualization techniques we investigated were presence versus absence of binocular disparity, four different types of graphic image (wireframe, flat shading, Gouraud shading and Gouraud shading with surface normals) and two levels of shape complexity. Results showed a positive effect of binocular disparity on perceptual performance (esp. 1), in particular when concave 3 D shapes were used as stimuli (esp. 2), but a limited positive effect of stereopsis on mental rotation. Furthermore, results indicated that subjects were faster in mentally rotating 3 D shapes <b>rendered</b> with more <b>realistic</b> techniques, whereas perceptual estimates were found more accurate and easier when observers were presented with less <b>realistic</b> <b>rendered</b> surfaces (exp. 1 - 2) ...|$|R
