40|$|Agency logic {{assumes that}} {{executives}} are greedy and opportunistic, which implies that monetary incentives {{are necessary to}} ensure they act {{in the best interests}} of shareholders; whereas corporate logic assumes that executives are trustworthy professionals, which implies that they will act {{in the best interests of}} shareholders irrespective of the use of monetary incentives. Prior qualitative research on executive remuneration is reviewed in this paper in order to ascertain how these logics influence the decision making of <b>remuneration</b> <b>committees.</b> Given that agency logic and corporate logic are opposites, there is a tension between the remuneration principles of pay-for-performance and competitive pay. However, corporate logic trumps agency logic as <b>remuneration</b> <b>committees</b> prioritise competitive pay ahead of other principles, so that talented executives will be retained. The paper also discusses a range of other remuneration principles and practices as well as the remuneration processes that have diffused both logics amongst <b>remuneration</b> <b>committees...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{draws on}} case studies from {{five of the}} UK privatized water plcs {{in order to examine}} how <b>Remuneration</b> <b>Committees</b> operationalized and {{justified}} their executive long-term incentive pay (LTIP) schemes. The article uses these as `revelatory' examples to illuminate how problematic decisions about executive pay can be. The water plc <b>Remuneration</b> <b>Committees,</b> concerned about potential stakeholder criticism, devoted considerable time and resources to ensure that their choice of LTIP comparators and performance metrics would be regarded as legitimate. The difficulties they encountered in pursuing this illustrate the underlying indeterminacy and incoherence of normative guidelines for implementing good governance in these substantive areas of executive remuneration. The article analyses this in terms of institutional incompleteness and argues that the resulting uncertainty creates theoretical as well as practical issues for resolving debates about what constitutes good governance...|$|R
2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the no {{conflict}} rule is to ensure directors carry out their tasks like it was their own interest at stake. Beyond corporate opportunities, the law requires directors accept no benefits from third parties under section 176, and also has specific regulation of transactions by a company with another party in which directors have an interest. Under section 177, when directors are {{on both sides of}} a proposed contract, for example where a person owns a business selling iron chairs to the company in which he is a director, it is a default requirement that they disclose the interest to the board, so that disinterested directors may approve the deal. The company's articles could heighten the requirement, say, to shareholder approval. If such a self dealing transaction has already taken place, directors still have a duty to disclose their interest and failure to do so is a criminal offence, subject to a £5000 fine. While such regulation through disclosure hovers with a relatively light touch, self dealing rules become more onerous as transactions become more significant. Shareholder approval is requisite for specific transactions with directors, or connected persons, when the sum of money either exceeds 10% of the company and is over £5000, or is over £100,000 in a company of any size. Further detailed provisions govern loaning money. On the question of director remuneration where the conflict of interest appears most serious, however, regulation is again relatively light. Directors pay themselves by default, but in large listed companies have pay set by a <b>remuneration</b> <b>committee</b> of directors. Under section 439, shareholders may cast a vote on remuneration but this [...] "say on pay", as yet, is not binding.|$|E

40|$|The {{establishment}} of board sub-committees has been strongly recommended as a suitable mechanism for improving corporate governance, by delegating specific tasks {{from the main}} board to a smaller group and harnessing the contribution of non-executive directors. In the UK, the Cadbury committee proposals focused on audit committees and the Greenbury study group advocated <b>remuneration</b> <b>committees.</b> Over the last decade, most large public com-panies have set up such committees, but their impact on governance standards has not been widely explored. This paper identifies {{significant differences in the}} orientation and operation of these committees. It also draws on interview data collected from participants in audit and <b>remuneration</b> <b>committees</b> to argue that these differences may lead to unacknowledged pressures on non-executive directors who form the membership of both committees. Given the current focus on the role of non-executive directors, the impact of such pressure is of particu-lar importance. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004. ...|$|R

40|$|Executive {{compensation}} within banking {{has received}} much attention from academics, politicians, {{the media and}} the general public {{in the light of the}} recent financial crisis whereby many financial institutions’ market capitalisation has fallen dramatically whilst their CEO’s remain to walk away with large remuneration packages. Although pay arrangements are being scrutinized by these wider commentators to a greater degree, no consensus on the underlying reasons explaining an apparent disconnect between bank performance and CEO pay has been reached. The use of compensation peer groups as a mechanism to allocate pay is widespread across many industries, including banking. Many academics have looked at the effectiveness of compensation peer groups, however the work is predominantly US based and this paper seeks to be the first to look specifically at the UK’s largest corporate banks from 2004 - 2011. Using a completely original data set collected manually through Annual Reports alongside Datastream and Bankscope, an attempt has been made to test whether the <b>remuneration</b> <b>committees</b> at the UK’s 10 largest corporate banks have been using peer groups as a way to exploit rising pay levels, or whether they are genuinely being used as an effective method to assess CEO performance. Using the Total Shareholder Return performance for the sample of 10 banks, as well as the Total Return Index for the Global FTSE and UK FTSE bank indexes, a multiple linear regression model has been able to test peer group strength following peer movements over the period. The results indicate that across our sample peer movements actually increased peer group strength in comparison to the rest of the market, indicating that <b>remuneration</b> <b>committees</b> have made sound judgements with regards to the composition of compensation peer groups, hence no evidence of manipulation being found.

This paper presents the results of a retrospective postal survey into the nature of corporate governance structures in UK companies. The objective {{of this paper is to}} isolate the extent to which key corporate governance innovations are being adopted in the boardrooms of UK companies. The main findings can be summarised as follows: (i) 77 per cent of the sample of quoted companies separated the role of chief executive officer and chairman in 1993 compared to 57 per cent in 1988; (ii) 94 per cent of quoted companies operated <b>remuneration</b> <b>committees</b> in 1993 as compared to 54 per cent in 1988; (iii) the incidence of audit committees among companies has doubled between 1988 and 1993 whilst the incidence of nomination committees has trebled; (iv) in apparent contradiction of the Institutional Shareholders’ Committee recommendation, of those companies that operated <b>remuneration</b> <b>committees</b> in 1993, 40 per cent had the top executive director as a committee member.
