As the former was endowed upon David for lifetime stewardship, it would be more <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> he conceded his entire realm, i.e., Thither Tao/Tayk and the adjacent Armenian counties up to Lake Van. Whatever the extent of David’s domain, the Georgian kings would not so easily reconcile with the loss of those territories, leading to a series of conflicts with the Byzantine Empire in the eleventh century.|$|E

40|$|When a self-gravitating disc {{is subject}} to irradiation, its {{propensity}} to fragmentation will be affected. The strength of self-gravitating disc stresses is expected to dictate disc fragmentation: as the strength of these torques typically decrease with increasing sound speed, it is <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume,</b> <b>to</b> first-order, <b>that</b> disc fragmentation is suppressed {{when compared to the}} non-irradiated case, although previous work has shown that the details are complicated by the source of the irradiation. We expand on previous analysis of the Jeans mass inside spiral structures in self-gravitating discs, incorporating the effects of stellar irradiation and background irradiation. If irradiation is present, fragmentation is suppressed for marginally unstable discs at low accretion rates (compared to the no-irradiation case), but these lower accretion rates correspond to higher mass discs. Fragmentation can still occur for high accretion rates, but is consequently suppressed at lower disc surface densities, and the subsequent Jeans mass is boosted. These results further bolster the consensus that, without subsequent fragment disruption or mass loss, the gravitational instability is more likely to form brown dwarfs and low-mass stars than gas giant planets.

However, bone density measurements have demonstrated that bone loss is common in patients with overt hyperthyroidism and, to a lesser extent, in those with subclinical hyperthyroidism. A history of overt hyperthyroidism is {{a risk factor for}} hip fracture later in life, which in turn is one of the causes of excess late mortality in previously hyperthyroid patients. It is therefore <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> in some hyperthyroid patients bone density does not completely return to normal after antithyroid treatment.|$|E

30|$|The peaks at 1373, 1329, and 898  cm− 1 {{were mainly}} due to carbohydrates, such as {{cellulose}} and hemicelluloses, {{but had no}} significant contribution from lignin. The intensities of these peaks were affected significantly by THM treatment. Reduction of the peak at 1373  cm− 1 {{is due to the}} formation of an ether linkage from hydroxyl groups within hemicelluloses and celluloses [29]. Another change observed was the slight reduction at 1329  cm− 1 for specimens according to the THM process. The previous results for the heat treatment of wood reported in the literature [21] show the appearance of a doublet at 1315 and 1335  cm− 1, characteristic of celluloses with a high-crystallized cellulose I content. The peak posited at 1329  cm− 1 is in the range of those at 1315 and 1335  cm− 1; it is <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the both bands represent the high-crystallized cellulose. Therefore, it can be implied that crystallinity of the cellulose was affected due to heating or/and high pressure by the indication of reduction in the band at 1329  cm− 1. Moreover, the dropping of C–H peak at 898  cm− 1 under THM process with the increasing CR was mainly due to the degradation of hemicellulose. The absorption of water by wood depends on the hydrophilic nature of each cell wall component and the accessibility of water to the hydroxyl groups of polymers. Most of the hydroxyl sites in the hemicelluloses and lignin are accessible to moisture. Moreover, it is accessible for moisture with the amorphous cellulose (non-crystalline portion of cellulose) and the surfaces of the crystallites, but not with the crystalline section of cellulose. The increase of crystallinity proportion due to degradation of hemicelluloses and amorphous cellulose during THM treatment reduced the water wettability on THM wood.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a case study into {{reciprocal}} learning in two tutor groups {{as part of a}} master's degree programme in special education. Reciprocal learning means that all members of the group, both students and teachers, learn from each other; however, the question is how and to what extent can reciprocal learning take shape, especially in an educational setting where the actors have different responsibilities. Data were gathered using a combination of methods and more than one source (triangulation) and a member check was performed on the whole cohort. The respondents reported that reciprocal learning in the tutor groups can improve the quality of learning for all participants. The extent to which this occurred appeared to be dependent on the expectations they had beforehand or the expectations they developed {{during the course of the}} research project.

25|$|A 'probable combatant' {{is someone}} killed at a {{location}} {{and at a time}} during which an armed confrontation was going on, who appears most likely – but not certain – to have been an active participant in the fighting.
