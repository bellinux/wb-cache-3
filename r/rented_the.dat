5|$|Another similar rags-to-riches {{story is}} Pang Lim, {{who was an}} illegal fruit hawker in Sungei Road in the 1970s. His big break came when he saved enough money to rent a coffee shop in 1990 with his younger brother and uncle. They <b>rented</b> <b>the</b> stalls out to other hawkers and managed the drinks stall themselves. The {{business}} took off and from one coffee shop, Pang is now the managing director of Koufu, which operates 20 foodcourts, five coffee shops and five cafes around the island.|$|E

The 69-year-old Houston was in his final days and physically feeble, requiring {{the use of a}} cane to get around.

5|$|The Beechwood estate also {{contained}} a carriage house, gatehouse, squash court (no longer extant), and a white-stucco artist's studio named Beech Twig, which {{was home to}} author John Cheever, whose children attended the school on the property. The family <b>rented</b> <b>the</b> house until they moved to Ossining. Descriptions of the building's interior closely match descriptions employed by Cheever in some short stories. Novelist Richard Yates also {{lived in the same}} house as a child, as well as other artists, writers, and composers.

5|$|The {{ground was}} first {{constructed}} in 1905, soon before the club moved in. The club <b>rented</b> <b>the</b> ground until 1933, when newly appointed chairman Charles Jeyes organised {{the purchase of}} the stadium. The club retained ownership of the ground until February 1989, when the freehold was sold to Luton Borough Council for £3.25million.

5|$|A tile setter, Anthony Cacchio Sr., <b>rented</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} in 1949 and converted {{it into a}} movie theater; it opened on February18, 1949 with a screening of the film Blood on the Moon. Cacchio owned the building outright by the mid-1950s. During this time, a severe flood damaged the Theatre's interior, and all the equipment had to be replaced. In its early years, the Theatre showed about 300 different movies each year, making it unpopular with film distributors. Denied easy access to first run films, the Theatre turned to independent movies and art films, and eventually began exhibiting live performances. Cacchio's entire family helped run the Theatre; his wife Fannie sold tickets and determined the Theatre's movie selection, while their sons Anthony Jr. and Rocco, and grandson Michael, ran the projector and eventually managed the day-to-day operation of the business.|$|E
5|$|Hamar Sportsanlegg (HSA) was {{established}} in 2003 to execute the plan. It was owned 34 percent by the municipality, and 22 percent each by Ham-Kam, Hamar IL and Storhamar Dragons. In 2004, Storhamar's share was transferred to Hamar Olympiske Anlegg, a municipal company which owns Vikingskipet Olympic Arena and Hamar Olympic Amphitheater. A report estimated the technical value of Briskeby to NOK6 million, while the sales price of the lot was estimated at NOK30 million. The municipal council voted on 18 February 2004 to transfer the ownership of the two stadiums to the new company. Ham-Kam <b>rented</b> <b>the</b> venues from HSA, with HSA's deficit {{for the first four}} years being covered by the municipality. Of the NOK20.8 million in value transferred to the company, NOK14.5 million was paid by HSA taking over the municipality's obligation to build a new athletics venue should Hamar stadion be closed, and NOK5 million was debt.|$|E

When War of the First Coalition broke out in 1793, the children were separated from their parents. Ramsay Phipps' father, Pownoll Phipps (1780–1858) and his siblings grew up in the French city during the French revolution, and lived under the threat of anti-English violence. Only after the Treaty of Campo Formio could the children return to England, arriving on 2 October 1798, all of them fluent in French; Pownoll Phipps reportedly spoke with French-accented English {{for the rest of his}} life. By the end of October, Pownoll had a commission as a lieutenant and joined the Bengal Army of the East India Company.

In 1909 they handed {{it over to the}} National Trust who have run it as a writer's home museum since then.

Mara <b>rented</b> <b>the</b> Polo Grounds as the team's stadium, and March developed a strategy that hinged on acquiring college stars such as Jim Thorpe. At 37years old, Thorpe was a shadow of his former self, and although he signed with the team, his contract required that he only play parts of games during the early portion of the season, until he got into shape, at which point he would play full games. He played only the first regular season game however, before ending his Giants career due to injury. His absence would severely hurt the team's monetary outlook for the season.|$|E

5|$|The 18th century saw the {{beginnings}} of change to agriculture on Shapinsay, courtesy of the Balfour family. The family owned the estate of Sound, which covered {{the western part of}} the island. Sound had passed from the Tulloch family to the Buchanan family in the 17th century. In 1674, Arthur Buchanan built the house of Sound, where Balfour Castle now stands. His granddaughter married James Fea, who is best known for his role in the capture of the Orkney Pirate John Gow. Fea was a supporter of the Jacobite Rebellion, and the house was burned by Hanoverian troops in revenge. The estate was acquired by Andrew Ross, Stewart Depute in Orkney of the Earl of Morton. Ross's heirs, the Lindsay brothers, sold the estate to Thomas Balfour in 1782. Balfour had previously <b>rented</b> <b>the</b> Bu of Burray, a large manor farm on another Orkney island, but had insufficient wealth to acquire the estate even though his wife had inherited a legacy on the death of her aristocratic brother. To raise the necessary funds, Balfour had to sell his military commission and borrow from his brother, John, who was prospering in India with the East India Company. Once installed on the island, he built a new house, Cliffdale, and founded the village of Shoreside, now known as Balfour. He also reformed the local agriculture, enclosing fields and constructing farm buildings.|$|E
