40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, {{there has been a}} {{rise in the number of}} {{multilateral}} regional agreements for marine environmental protection. A large proportion of these regional agreements are the result of the United Nations Environment Programme 2 ̆ 7 s (UNEP) <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> Programme. While there are thirteen <b>regional</b> <b>seas</b> under the Programme, the Arctic Ocean is not, and never was, one of them. In describing concerns regarding the Arctic environment and approaches to handle them, a number of commentators have proposed the application of UNEP <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> Programme approach to the Arctic region. However, despite an attempt from the Inuit Circumpolar Conference and the Canadian government in 1988, an Arctic action plan developed under the guidance of UNEP still does not exist. This fact does not mean that the regional approach to environmental protection for the Arctic has been abandoned. The primary purpose of this paper is to compare the Arctic Environmental Strategy to the UNEP <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> Programme, the predominant approach to regional marine environmental protection and management. The secondary purpose of the paper is to present an assessment and validation of the <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> Programme approach. A tertiary purpose is to determine what lessons the AEPS teaches for the <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> Programme, in particular, and for ocean management in general. After setting the regional background, the paper introduces the UNEP <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> Programme and describes the approach used in the Programme. The paper proceeds with a description of the process and the approach by which the Arctic nations created the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy.

40|$|The 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, UN Conference, 1972) {{outlined}} a 'masterplan' linking environmental assessment, environmental management and supporting measures as basic and inseparable elements of environmental actions plans. It also indicated {{the advantages of}} a regional approach in contributing to the solution of global problems. The <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> Programme of UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) was subsequently initiated in 1974 (UN General Assembly, 1972). Development of UNEP's <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> Programme demonstrated that the basic concepts formulated at Stockholm can effectively foster regional cooperation among interested States, and may benefit from {{the support of the}} United Nations system as a whole. The present <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> Programme includes fourteen regions, comprising over 140 coastal States. It was conceived as an action-oriented programme encompassing a comprehensive, trans-sectoral approach to marine and coastal areas and to environmental problems, considering not only the consequences, but also the causes of environmental degradation. Each <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> Programme is based on the needs of the region concerned. The <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> Programmes promote the parallel development of regional legal agreements, and of action-oriented programme activities, as embodied in the action plans. The overall strategy to be followed, as defined by UNEP's Governing Council (UNEP, 1974) is: - Promotion of international and regional conventions, guidelines and actions for the control of marine pollution and the protection and management of aquatic resources. - Assessment of the state of marine pollution, pollution sources and trends, and of the impact of pollution on human health, marine ecosystems and amenities. - Coordination of efforts with regard to environmental aspects of the protection, development and management of marine and coastal resources. - Support for education and training efforts to facilitate the full participation of developing countries in the protection, development and management of marine and coastal resources. Because the goal of each <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> Programme is to benefit the States of that region, governments are involved from the very beginning in the formulation of the action plan. After acceptance, the implementation of the programme is carried out, under the overall authority of the governments concerned, by national institutions nominated by their governments. Although the <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> Programme is implemented primarily by government-nominated institutions, specialized United Nations bodies, as well as the relevant international and regional organizations, contribute to its formulation, and also provide assistance to these national institutions. UNEP acts as an overall coordinator for {{the development and implementation of}} regional action plans. In some cases, this role is limited to the initial phase of the activities. ...|$|R

50|$|Local mean {{sea level}} (LMSL) {{is defined as the}} height of the sea with respect to a land benchmark, {{averaged}} {{over a period of time}} (such as a month or a year) long enough that fluctuations caused by waves and tides are smoothed out. One must adjust perceived changes in LMSL to account for vertical movements of the land, which can be of the same order (mm/yr) as sea level changes. Some land movements occur because of isostatic adjustment of the mantle to the melting of ice sheets at the end of the last ice age. The weight of the ice sheet depresses the underlying land, and when the ice melts away the land slowly rebounds. Changes in ground-based ice volume also affect local and <b>regional</b> <b>sea</b> levels by the readjustment of the geoid and true polar wander. Atmospheric pressure, ocean currents and local ocean temperature changes can affect LMSL as well.|$|E

However island nations to the east of the dateline such as Niue and Tonga, faced an increased risk of being affected by a tropical cyclone. It was also noted that cyclones could affect parts of southwest French Polynesia and the southern Cook Islands during an El Niño, while the number of ex tropical cyclones coming to within 550 km of New Zealand was expected to remain about normal.

In area C the scientists concern themselves about social reactions and developments connected with anthropogenic climate change.

The mounds look like 'sand volcanoes', each with a 'tail', up to several hundred meters long, all oriented downstream.Large congregations of Xenophyophores (Syringammina fragilissima) which are giant unicellular organisms that can grow up to 25 cm in diameter characterize the tails and mounds. Scientists are uncertain why these organisms congregate here. The Darwin Mounds Lophelia grow on sand rather than hard substrate, unique to this area.
