40|$|In recent years, the {{motorcycle}} muffler design {{is moving to}} dissipative silencer architectures. Due to the increased of restrictions on noise emissions, both dissipative and coupled reactive-dissipative mufflers have substituted {{the most widely used}} <b>reactive</b> <b>silencers.</b> This led to higher noise efficiency of the muffler and size reduction. A dissipative muffler is composed by a perforated pipe that crosses a cavity volume filled by a fibrous porous material. The acoustic performance of this kind of muffler are strictly dependent on the porosity of the perforated pipe and the flow resistivity characteristic of the porous material. However, while the acoustic performance of a reactive muffler is almost independent from the presence of a mean flow for typical Mach numbers of exhaust gases, in a dissipative muffler the acoustic behaviour is strictly linked to the mass flow rate intensity. In this paper, an experimental analysis on a commercial dissipative muffler for motorcycles is presented. More in details, the acoustic performance of the silencer is determined by using a test rig that is based on the multi-microphone technique and the two source method. The acoustic test rig used allows carrying out the measurements in presence of mean flow in order to evaluate the influence of the mean flow on the muffler acoustic performance. The possibility to study the muffler behaviour in presence of mean flow makes the experimental conditions closer to the real operating ones. The aim of the present work is to determine how the acoustic response of a dissipative muffler is influenced by the fluid-dynamic interaction between the mean flow and the flow resistivity chamber...|$|R
30|$|The resonance-type {{resistance}} silencer {{is based}} on the principle of the Helmholtz resonator (HR). It has the advantages of simple structure, high amount of noise elimination, and small pressure loss, among other attributes. It is widely used in automotive engine air intake noise control (Sohn and Park 2011). Arefi et al. (2014) was able to improve reverberation time in a conference room using HRs with defined dimensions, diffusers, and sound absorbers. Mao and Pietrzko (2010) carried out an experimental investigation of passive control of sound transmission through a double-glazed window by using an arrangement of HRs. It was shown that a considerable reduction of the transmitted sound pressure levels has been achieved around the mass-air-mass resonance frequency (50 – 120  Hz). Lee et al. (2013) studied the effect of leakage on the acoustic performance of <b>reactive</b> <b>silencers,</b> such as expansion chambers, HRs, and quarter-wave resonators. Sanada and Tanaka (2013) used two degree of freedom Helmholtz-based resonators with a flexible panel to extend the frequency range of resonant sound absorbers. Yasuda et al. (2013), based on the typical structure, designed a muffler with an interconnecting hole on the tail tube, which was proposed to improve its acoustic performance. Park (2013) introduced a micro-perforated panel of absorbers backed by HRs to improve sound absorption in the low-frequency region, where conventional micro-perforated panel absorbers cannot provide sufficient absorption. Singh and Rienstra (2014) presented a systematic derivation of a solution of the nonlinear HR equation, in order to obtain analytically expressions for impedances close to resonance, while including nonlinear effects. Atak et al. (2014) combined two concepts to design acoustic lenses that are based on HRs. It was shown that using HR-based sonic crystals leads to better acoustic lens designs, especially at the low frequencies, where the local resonances are pronounced. At present, research focuses primarily on designing or analyzing HR, which has a good effects on the air inlet system’s low-frequency noise elimination; however, a larger proportion of intake system noise is high-frequency, especially during rapid acceleration. In order to improve an automobile’s riding comfort, it is necessary to establish a method to suppress the engine’s air inlet high-frequency noise during rapid acceleration.|$|R
40|$|A quarter {{wavelength}} side branch resonator {{has been widely}} used as a <b>reactive</b> type <b>silencer</b> to attenuate pressure pulsation in hydraulic circuit. The structure of this conventional silencer is very simple and therefore it is a useful device in terms of cost efficiency. However, it {{is also known as}} a rather narrow frequency banded resonator that only attenuates the odd order harmonics of the pressure pulsation. In this study, the attenuation performance of side branch resonator in the hydraulic line is examined numerically by changing the parameters such as the insertion location of side branch and the length of connecting pipe between the side branch and termination load of circuits. The level of attenuation is accessed by insertion loss which is defined as the ratio of overall amplitude harmonics of pressure pulsation with and without the side branch. The paper describes the fundamental principle of side branch and the mathematical model of insertion loss characteristics. Some calculation results for the insertion loss characteristics are carried out to show the influence of even order harmonics and the interaction of pump, termination load and all pulsation propagation characteristics of the circuit including side branch...|$|R
40|$|A mode-matching {{method is}} used to {{investigate}} {{the performance of a}} two-dimensional, modified <b>reactive</b> <b>silencer.</b> The modification {{takes the form of a}} membrane which is attached to the internal walls of the expansion chamber parallel to the axis of the inlet/outlet ducts. The height of the membrane above the level of the inlet/outlet ducts can be varied and, by this means, the device is tuned. It is shown that the stopband produced by the silencer can be broadened and/or shifted depending upon the height to which the membrane is raised. Attention is focused on the efficiency of the device at low-frequencies - the regime where dissipative silencers are usually least effective. The potential use of the device as a component in a hybrid silencer for heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) ducting systems is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Classical {{analytical}} models {{used for}} prediction {{of the performance}} of reactive silencers are limited to conditions where the dimensions of the duct and resonators are small compared to the wavelength of the sound. Finite Element Analysis does not suer from such limitations and has therefore been used to analyse the design of a <b>reactive</b> <b>silencer</b> for the exhaust stack of a 980 MW power station. To assist in the design process, resonators of various dimensions were analysed using FEA which has led to the derivation of expressions for the resonance frequencies of slot-type rhomboid shaped resonators {{as a function of the}} geometry. An important design issue is the influence that adjacent resonators have on the overall performance of the system. It was found that when resonators of similar resonance frequency are in close proximity, they can interact and lead to a decrease in the overall performance compared to that of a single resonator. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This work {{provides}} {{the results of}} a study involving activities on reducing noise through the use of multichamber combined aerodynamic silencers in industrial vacuum cleaners. The topicality of this work is associated with the fact that in using industrial vacuum cleaners noise levels prescribed by GOST 12. 1. 003 - 83 [1] are exceeded. For instance, the acoustic characteristics of T- 1 and NPP- 2 [7, 8] vacuum cleaners do not correspond to normative requirements at a rotational speed of n= 3000 rpm and a component density of q = 0, 01 pcs/m 2 [1]. Note that exceeded sound pressure levels are observed mainly in high-frequency areas (1000 [...] . 8000 Hz) and is about 7 [...] . 10 dB. As the first version, the study tested a multichamber <b>reactive</b> <b>silencer</b> serially installed on an NPP- 2 vacuum cleaner [8], and as the second version, the study tried a new multichamber silencer [13], wherein the interior is worked by a noise absorber with a thickness of 10 mm.

Their in-depth analyses {{are essential for}} the development of advanced noise control solutions. In this thesis, a package of efficient numerical modeling tools is developed based on the sub-structuring approach, {{in order to deal with}} complex structural-acoustical couplings among various subsystem components in a wide range of applications. A Compound Interface-Patch Transfer Function (CI-PTF) approach is proposed, highlighting its ability in handling mixed separations, such as those composed of rigid or flexible structures and apertures. Typical structural and acoustical subsystems are characterized as a few versatile subsystem modules, serving as the building blocks for constructing complex system configurations. The convergence, accuracy, and efficiency of the developed numerical tools are thoroughly validated. As an important non-fibrous sound absorbing material, micro-perforated panels (MPPs) and their in-situ sound absorption in coupled vibroacoustic systems are investigated. The MPP is modeled as an integral component of the system using the proposed CI-PTF approach. Numerical studies show that the actual sound absorption performance of the MPPs strongly depends on the surrounding environment, which unequivocally demonstrates that MPP cannot be simply considered as a locally reactive element in a complex vibroacoustic environment. For sound transmission control inside a duct, acoustic silencers are considered whose modeling is systematically tackled by the proposed numerical tools. <b>Reactive</b> <b>silencers</b> with rigid internal partitions are studied for their parametric influences and noise attenuation mechanisms. With the introduction of MPPs as dissipative elements, a unit cell treatment is proposed to model the complex side-branch configuration, and investigations reveal the hybrid attenuation mechanism of such device, which combines the reflection and absorption effects. Benefiting from the modular nature of the sub-structuring approach, the size of the perforated hole and the perforation ratio can be optimized to strike a balance between the dissipative and reactive effect, for ultimately achieving a desired Transmission Loss (TL) within a prescribed frequency range. The calculation accuracy for both reactive and hybrid MPP silencers using the proposed approach have been confirmed with finite element method (FEM) simulations and experiments. For the tuning and optimization of a silencer, the broadband TL performance realized by a number of cascade-connected sub-chambers is investigated. A theoretical basis for the description of the overall system TL is presented. The characteristics of the sub-chambers, along with the understandings of influences of the parameters, provide guidelines for their optimizations, and a desired broadband performance is achieved by connecting sub-chambers with optimized TLs to tackle different frequency regions. Based on the sub-chamber strategy, a multi-level approach for the design, analysis and optimization of acoustic silencers with cascaded sub-chambers is proposed. Through numerical case studies and a retrofitted design of a mining truck muffler, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated, which greatly reduces the design variables and computational costs compared with global design and optimization.

40|$|Gas {{pulsations}} commonly {{exist in}} HVACR, energy and automotive industry. They {{are believed to}} be a major source for system inefficiency, vibrations, noises and fatigue failures. It has been widely accepted that gas pulsations mainly take place at the discharge side of a positive displacement (PD) type compressor such as a screw, scroll or internal combustion engine. The pulsation magnitudes, ranging from a fraction to a few bars, are especially significant at off-design conditions of either under-compression (UC) or over-compression (OC). Traditionally, a serial pulsation dampener, often a <b>reactive</b> type <b>silencer,</b> is connected after the compressor or engine discharge. It is capable of reducing pressure pulsation by 10 plus fold; or 20 plus dB. However these dampeners are bulky and impose sizable back pressure losses. This paper discusses an alternative method, a shunt pulsation trap (SPT), using a parallel configuration, which tackles the gas pulsations before the compressor or engine discharge. The SPT method is based on the shock tube theory [1] that characterizes the nature of gas pulsation as a composition of non-linear waves, compression wave (CW) and expansion wave (EW) and induced fluid flow (IFF). The theory also predicts that the dominant source of gas pulsation is a direct result from the sudden discharging process under UC or OC condition. Two prototypes, 75 HP and 350 HP Roots type blowers, were built and tested with and without SPT. The experimental results partially validate the new theory and also indicate a 10 plus fold; or 20 plus dB pulsation reduction by using SPT under different load and speed conditions without suffering any back pressure losses...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{finding of}} the broadband {{performance of a}} <b>reactive</b> <b>silencer</b> is validated experimentally. The silencer consists of two highly stretched membranes lining part of the duct and backed by two long and shallow cavities. The test rig was built with a small square duct of 5 cm in dimension, and each cavity is 5 cm deep and 25 cm long. Two types of metal foils, stainless steel and copper, were used, and the lowest membrane-to-air mass ratio was 1. 3. A transmission loss in excess of 10 dB was achieved over more than one octave band. For one configuration close to the optimal parameters, the predicted ratio of the frequency band limits is 2. 47, while the experiment gave 2. 35. Three spectral peaks {{were found in the}} stopband, as predicted, but the peaks were broader than prediction, indicating the presence of significant sound energy dissipation mechanisms. Comparison with theoretical simulation shows that the cavity damping dominates over membrane friction. Tests using heavier membranes and membrane with different levels of tension also agree with predictions. Issues of practical implementation of the concept as a flow-through silencer are also addressed. © 2002 Acoustical Society of America. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
