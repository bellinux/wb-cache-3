30|$|Combustion {{of fossil}} fuel {{is what we}} think of as burning {{processes}} basically a reaction with oxygen. Fossil fuels are composed primarily of hydrocarbons. The amount of energy released during combustion is dependent on the oxidation state of the carbons in the hydrocarbon which is related to the hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratio. The more hydrogen per carbon, the lower the oxidation state and the more energy that will be released during the oxidation reaction. The presence of oxygenates in fuels reduces the amount of carbon monoxide and unburned fuel in the exhaust gas. Oxygenate blending is basically the addition of oxygen-bearing compounds such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), and ethanol to gasoline/diesel. Throughout the USA, oxygenate blending is mandated by EPA regulations to reduce smog and other airborne pollutants. For example, in Southern California, a fuel must contain 2  % oxygen by weight, resulting in a mixture of 5.6  % ethanol in <b>gasoline</b> (Removal of <b>reformulated</b> <b>gasoline</b> oxygen content requirement (national) and revision of commingling prohibition to address non-oxygenated <b>reformulated</b> <b>gasoline</b> (national), 2006). The resulting fuel is often known as <b>reformulated</b> <b>gasoline</b> (RFG) or oxygenated gasoline. Ethanol-blended fuel has been a great success in Brazil where ethanol is being used as a primary fuel for several decades; E- 85 to E- 100 are the most common in them. Several countries in the European Union also use ethanol-blended gasoline due to environmental consideration. In India, the government has mandated up to 5  % ethanol for metro cities, recently for all over the country, and has a plan to extend it up to 10  % in the future (Government to take a call on ethanol price soon, 2011). Thus, in the case of a blended fuel (oxy-diesel, <b>reformulated</b> <b>gasoline),</b> in addition to the H/C ratio, the O/C ratio would be a parameter of interest (Sarpal et al. 1997).|$|R

A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is introduced which is nonconvex due to the presence of bilinear, polynomial, and fractional power terms. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) relaxation of the extended pooling problem is proposed and we introduce several test cases from small to medium to large scale and solve them to global optimality. The large-scale test case involves 14 feed stocks, 5 pools, and 10 products and consists of 1104 continuous variables, 150 binary variables, and 640 nonlinear terms.

In addition to this North American automakers have in 2006 and 2007 promoted a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, marketed as E85, and their flex-fuel vehicles, e.g. GM's [...] "Live Green, Go Yellow" [...] campaign.
