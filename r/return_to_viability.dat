The Communications include: The first Communication which (initially), {{was the only one}} that the Commission adopted intentionally: the Communication on the application of State aid rules to measures taken in relation to financial institutions in the context of the current global financial crisis (hereinafter "the Banking Communication"). However, faced with the pressure to issue more guidelines (such pressure being exerted by Member States), the Commission adopted three further Communications: the Communication on the re capitalisation of financial institutions in the current financial crisis: limitation of aid to the minimum necessary and safeguards against undue distortions of competition (hereinafter "the Recapitalisation Communication"); the Communication “On the treatment of impaired assets in the Community banking sector” (hereinafter, “the Toxic Assets Comunication”) and finally, the Communication on the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>viability</b> and the assessment of restructuring measures in the financial sector in the current crisis under the State aid rules (hereinafter "the Restructuring Communication"). ” Whilst the Banking and Re capitalisation Communications constituted the focus of study in Part I to this paper, this paper will focus on the impact of shadow banking and Basel III on regulatory arbitrage, the corresponding need for greater transparency and disclosure within financial markets – particularly within OTC markets, and impediments to the successful implementation of capital requirements which are aimed at fostering financial stability, coordination and harmonisation. Further, it will consider the extent to which regulators are prepared to deviate from regulations during the implementation of stress-testing and rescue programmes which are aimed at restoring stability to the financial system. The redefinition of quantitative and qualitative standards for capital, in implementing the Supervisory Capital Assessment Programme (SCAP), as illustrated in the paper, should demonstrate the extent to which regulators, independent of shadow banking practices, are prepared to deviate from capital regulations under adverse scenarios where certain regulations prove to be unduly stringen...|$|E

Assuming that public action can modify {{the prestige of}} a language {{in order to avoid}} language extinction, we analyze two cases: (i) the prestige can only take two values, (ii) it can take any value but its change at each time step is bounded. In both cases, we determine the viability kernel, that is, the set of states for which there exists an action policy maintaining the coexistence of the two languages, and we define such policies. We also study the resilience of the languages and identify configurations from where the system can <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the <b>viability</b> kernel (definite resilience), or where one of the languages is lead to disappear (zero resilience).

Inhibition of Oc-j by Juglans species bark extracts. A reliable disease screening technique {{is needed for}} detecting Juglans cinerea with resistance to butternut canker. Both naphthoquinones and bark extracts of Juglans species inhibited germination of Oc-j conidia, depending on the selections of butternut. Juglone and plumbagin were found. Juglone levels correlated with the bark extract bioassay in some months. Influence of temperature and humidity on the viability of Oc-j conidia. Dispersal of Oc-j by vectors necessitates conidia to tolerate drying. Temperature and humidity influenced conidia germination and survival of air dried conidia.

40|$|The {{recession}} of the 1990 s {{has spawned a}} rapid {{growth in the number}} of venture-backed buy-outs of failed firms. Buy-outs from firms in receivership raise the questions as to whether the managers involved were 'pushed' into entrepreneurship to save their jobs in the absence of alternative employment opportunities, or whether they were more proactive, and whether managers associated with the firm entering receivership are able <b>to</b> <b>return</b> the company <b>to</b> <b>viability.</b> Use of the Centre for Management Buy-out Research's general database indicates a shift in the nature of buy-outs from receivership between the {{recession of}} the early 1980 s and that of the early 1990 s, and that buy-outs from receivership in the early 1980 s were significantly more likely to fail again than buy-outs in general. Descriptive statistics from a representative survey sample of 64 receivership buy-outs completed between 1990 and 1992 indicate that many arise from potentially viable divisions of failed groups, that in a substantial number of cases buy-out attempts had been made prior to failure and that managers often had alternative employment opportunities. To examine the extent to which managers of failed companies can become successful entrepreneurs, the paper presents regression analysis of the determinants of post-buy-out performance as a function of management and firm characteristics. management buy-out failure corporate strategy...|$|R
40|$|Moonee Colliery {{operates}} a longwall extraction {{system in the}} Great Northern seam of the Newcastle Coal Measures, approximately 100 km north of Sydney, NSW. In the initial mine area of longwall blocks 1 - 4 a, the Great Northern seam is overlain by a massive conglomerate approximately 35 m in thickness at an average depth of cover of 130 m. Unanticipated sudden, blocky caving of this material has produced windblasts with associated velocities of 100 m/sec and over-pressures of 35 kPa. Although these events have not resulted in fatality, the potential safety risk to face personnel was such that the mine was threatened with closure. The development of a Windblast Management Plan to minimise the exposure to windblasts, a Micro-seismic Management Plan to predict caving events, {{and the use of}} hydraulic fracturing to generate caving on demand, have all contributed to the saviour of the mine. Prior to the introduction of hydraulic fracturing, falls were highly variable and ranged in goaf area from 2000 m 2 to 30, 000 m 2 with an average of around 7, 000 m 2. Hydraulic fracturing has introduced consistent and far less variable falls, planned as averaging around 5000 m 2 and all accompanied by microseismic warning. Moonee Colliery {{is believed to be the}} only operation in the world using real-time microseismic warning and using hydrofracturing as a day-to-day operational process. These processes have enabled it <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> financial <b>viability</b> in an environment of strict procedural control, whilst ongoing efforts are made to optimise and enhance these systems.

After several simulations and short space exposure experiments such as BIOPAN, {{this was the first}} long-term exposure of eukaryotic organisms to the hostile space conditions of the low Earth orbit (LEO). The biological samples were integrated in the EXPOSE-E facility and exposed for 1. 5 years outside the ISS to the combined impact of insolation, ultraviolet (UV) -irradiation, cosmic radiation, temperatures and vacuum conditions of LEO space. Additionally, a subset of X. elegans samples was exposed to simulated Martian environmental conditions by applying Mars-analogue atmosphere and suitable solar radiation filters. After their <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Earth the <b>viability</b> of the lichen samples was ascertained by viability analysis of LIVE/DEAD staining and confocal laser-scanning microscopy, but also by analyses of chlorophyll a fluorescence.

Post-exposure viability rates did not significantly vary among the applied exposure conditions. This remarkable viability is discussed in the context of particular protective mechanisms of lichens such as anhydrobiosis and UV-screening pigments...|$|R

40|$|No poster available. Management {{strategy}} evaluation (MSE) is {{a methodology}} which allows {{to compare the}} efficiency of different management strategies {{in order to ensure}} the sustainability, in particular those based on viable control theory. Classic strategies (like precautionary approach of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES) were compared to strategies defined from a viability control model for the Peruvian anchovy, which provides the biomass levels B which can be sustainable managed (viability kernel) and its related sustainable yields. Five management strategies (E 1 [...] E 5) were considered to define the total allowable catch Y* for the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens) : E 1) social quota (Y* = Ymin), E 2) ICES precautionary quota, E 3) maximum viable quota Y*=Ymax(B), E 4) maximum precautionary viable quota and, E 5) half precautionary viable quota. We used five indicators for sustainability, related to the risk of collapse and the mean and variability of yields and biomasses. Two scenarios for initial biomasses were considered (healthy stock and postcollapse recovering stock). The analyses were done with Monte Carlo simulations, with 10 000 simulations per scenario and strategy. Uncertainty was incorporated in the quota implementation, simulating the variability of discards and illegal catches. The effect of the enviroment during 1963 [...] 1984 was considered by changing the stock-recruitment parameters during El Niño events. We found that the half precautionary viable quota (E 5) could avoid the anchoveta fishery collapse in 1972 [...] 1973, allowing yields greater than the social quota. Also, the ICES precautionary strategy (E 2) did not ensure the sustainability of the stock during El Niño events. We determine that a one year fishery moratorium after the fishery collapse would have been necessary <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the <b>viability</b> kernel, allowing a sustainable management thereafter. We conclude that the viability kernel and viable yields are useful tools for designing management strategies which ensure the sustainability of natural resources...|$|R
