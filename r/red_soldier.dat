2500|$|The {{division}} was re-formed in December 1941 {{in the capital}} of the Armenian SSR, Yerevan, following the German invasion of the Soviet Union. It was a redesignation of the 474th Rifle Division, which was formed on 14 December 1941 and renumbered the 89th Rifle Division on 26 December 1941. Over {{the course of the war}} period, the division had a number of commanders, including Colonel Simeon G. Zakyan (who was killed in action in April 1942 during military operations in the Kerch peninsula), Lieutenant-Colonel Andranik Sargsyan, Colonel Artashes Vasilyan, and finally Colonel [...] G. Safaryan, who took over command in February 1943 and would eventually attain the rank of Major General. It published its own weekly Armenian-language newspaper called the <b>Red</b> <b>Soldier</b> (Կարմիր Զինվոր).|$|E
2500|$|Another fatal formation, {{called the}} [...] "cannon-controlled {{centroid}} horse" [...] (Chinese: 炮鎮窩心馬, diagram at right), also requires particularly bad coordination {{of the enemy}} pieces. In the diagram, Black's [...] "centroid horse" [...] occupies {{the centre of the}} palace, blocking Black's own general and advisors; while Black's cannon at e8 is pinned to the defence of his own general and cannot move, and it also restricts the movement of Black's two elephants. Such formation in the middlegame often produces deadly threats of smothered mates; while in the endgame, as in the diagram, Red's cannon is hard to chase away, making the Black horse and cannon permanently pinned and trapped. Even though Black is up a minor piece, he is dead lost: The game concluded 41.Hg7 (attacking the elephant and creating a mating threat) Eg10 42.Hh9 Ci9 43.Hf8+ Cf9 (if without the other Black cannon, it is instant mate) 44.Hxg6, and Black resigned: Black's only active piece is absolutely hopeless against the passed <b>Red</b> <b>soldier</b> and the horse.|$|E
60|$|After {{crossing}} {{this mountain}} and descending {{on the other}} side towards a thick wood, Evan Dhu held some conference with his Highland attendants, in consequence of which Edward's baggage was shifted from the shoulders of the gamekeeper to those of one of the gillies, and the former was sent off with the other mountaineer in a direction {{different from that of the}} three remaining travellers. On asking the meaning of this separation, Waverley was told that the Lowlander must go to a hamlet about three miles off for the night; for unless it was some very particular friend, Donald Bean Lean, the worthy person whom they supposed to be possessed of the cattle, did not much approve of strangers approaching his retreat. This seemed reasonable, and silenced a qualm of suspicion which came across Edward's mind when he saw himself, at such a place and such an hour, deprived of his only Lowland companion. And Evan immediately afterwards added,'that indeed he himself had better get forward, and announce their approach to Donald Bean Lean, as the arrival of a sidier roy (<b>red</b> <b>soldier)</b> might otherwise be a disagreeable surprise.' And without waiting for an answer, in jockey phrase, he trotted out, and putting himself to a very round pace, was out of sight in an instant.|$|E

60|$|Looking {{out between}} the trees {{we could see a}} great side of mountain, running down {{exceeding}} steep into the waters of the loch.

There was no cheering now, for I think they had other uses for what breath was left them; but they still stuck to the trail, and doubtless thought that we were close in front of them.|$|R
