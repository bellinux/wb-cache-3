30|$|For the {{performance}} comparison, we examined two metrics: the MPCT and the NBRP. Although minimum MPCT {{is one of}} the ultimate goals of all task assignment schemes, the NBRP is also an important metric in the sense that smaller NBRP values mean less <b>remote</b> <b>processing</b> employed, and thus it is less likely the data processing would be delayed by network congestion and/or disk contention. Furthermore, <b>remote</b> <b>processing</b> involves more factors than local processing, thus it is more likely to fail due to its complexity. Therefore, a task assignment scheme that employs less <b>remote</b> <b>processing</b> would be more favorable to one that employs more, if the MPCT’s achieved by both schemes are close.|$|E

However, because of heterogeneous storage, resources of different stations and domains can’t be operated mutually and shared.

40|$|Abstract. The {{traditional}} centralized {{single mode}} becomes a “bottleneck ” of <b>remote</b> sensing image <b>processing</b> which cannot {{meet the needs}} of future <b>remote</b> sensing image <b>processing</b> development. Fortunately, the distributed parallel computing has provided a turning point to the quick calculation of remote sensing image. This paper presents the cluster computing environment based on the MPI, and advances a project of a parallelized design to the gray level co-occurrence matrix algorithm. Moreover, the experimental data, which is due to the parallelized algorithm running in the cluster, is recorded and analyzed in several respects such as different nodes, time, speedup, efficiency and so on. The analyzed result shows that parallel computing cluster based on MPICH can efficiently improve the speed of <b>remote</b> sensing image <b>processing</b> in the case of more complex algorithms. However, when the number of node increases, the consuming time decreases, and the efficiency will decrease at the same time. So, it is rather important to keep the balance between performance and efficiency. The nodes can not be continuously added into computing, when the consuming time can be accepted...|$|R
