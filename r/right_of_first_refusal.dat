40|$|Given growing {{concerns}} {{about the loss of}} farmland in the US, governmental and nonprofit groups are seeking innovative, cost-effective methods to preserve lands that will elicit additional landowner participation. This article describes four innovative farmland preservation techniques and derives implications for the policy process through interviews of key stakeholders: program administrators, lawmakers, and landowners. Experts on farmland preservation were also interviewed to ensure stakeholder perceptions substantively inform the policy process. Four techniques were selected for assessment from approximately 30 novel techniques. Reactions to these policy options reflect stakeholder perceptions of a baseline condition; the perceptions help evaluate which options are likely to survive the policy process and what attributes will lead to their acceptability because few of these techniques have yet become policy. Although the stakeholders may have more limited experience with the policy process, land preservation experts validated many of the results and the possibility of success in the â€œrough and tumbleâ€ 9 D of the policy process. Of the four investigated techniques <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>first</b> <b>refusal</b> was the most favored, although respondents thought effective implementation would require careful targeting and a dedicated funding source. Experts agreed this technique was most likely to survive in the political arena. Agricultural conservation pension was also viewed favorably, though it was considered administratively difficult to implement. Several experts thought that, though inchoate, the pension plan could potentially be more cost effective than <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>first</b> <b>refusal.</b> Land preservation tontines were perceived to be an interesting concept, but confusing, difficult to implement, and ill-defined.

5|$|On May 9, 2007, it was {{announced}} that production rights to the Terminator series had passed from the feuding Vajna and Kassar to the Halcyon Company. The producers hoped to start a new trilogy based on the franchise. The purchase was financed with a loan by Pacificor, a hedge fund from Santa Monica. By July 19, the project was in legal limbo due to a lawsuit between MGM and Halcyon subsidiary T Asset. MGM had an exclusive window of 30 days to negotiate for distribution of the Terminator films. When negotiating for Terminator 4, Halcyon rejected their initial proposal, and MGM suspended negotiations. After the 30 days were over, MGM claimed that the period during which negotiations were suspended did not count and their exclusive period was still open. Halcyon asked a court for an injunction allowing them to approach other distributors. Later, the lawsuit was settled and MGM got a 30-day <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>first</b> <b>refusal</b> to finance and distribute the fifth Terminator film.|$|E
5|$|The strike {{lasted until}} August 10, 1974 when the players {{returned}} to training camp without a new CBA, instead choosing to pursue free agency through the Mackey lawsuit filed three years before. While the courts {{ruled in favor}} of the players in 1976, the union found that making progress in bargaining was more difficult to achieve. The Rozelle Rule was invalidated by the court which found it constituted a refusal to deal and was therefore in violation of the Sherman Act as it deterred franchises from signing free agents. However, the change did not achieve true free agency as compensation remained tied to draft picks that were awarded based on the salary of the departing free agent and teams still maintained a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>first</b> <b>refusal.</b> The NFL and NFLPA agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement in March 1977 that ran until 1982.|$|E

Team owner Molson Brewery sold control of the franchise and the Molson Centre to American businessman George N.

5|$|In 1967, {{after eight}} years of private operation, the Pillsbury Company {{acquired}} the Burger King brand and its parent company Burger King Corporation. At the time of the purchase, the chain had grown to 274 restaurants in the United States. Pillsbury continued to grow the company utilizing the existing franchise system despite its flaws. The power of its independent franchises came to a head in 1973 when Chart House, owner of 350 restaurants and one of its largest franchise groups, attempted to purchase the chain from Pillsbury for $100million (USD) which Pillsbury declined. When Chart House's bid failed, its owners Billy and Jimmy Trotter put forth a second plan that would require Pillsbury and Chart House spin off their respective holdings and merge the two entities into a separate company. Again Pillsbury declined the proposed divestiture. After the failed attempts to acquire the company, the relationship with Chart House and the Trotters soured; when Chart House purchased several restaurants in Boston and Houston in 1979, Burger King sued the selling franchisees for failing to comply with the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>first</b> <b>refusal</b> clause in their contracts. Burger King won the case, successfully preventing the sale. The two parties did eventually reach a settlement where Chart House kept the Houston locations in their portfolio. Chart House eventually spun off its Burger King holdings and refocused on its higher end chains; its Burger King holding company, DiversiFoods, was eventually acquired by Pillsbury $390million (USD) in 1984 and folded into Burger King's operations.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} interviews and focus groups, gauging support for innovative farmland preservation techniques. Four techniques were selected for assessment from approximately 30 novel techniques identified in previous research: (1) Term conservation easements; (2) Land preservation tontines; (3) <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>first</b> refusal; and (4) Agricultural conservation pension with purchase of agricultural conservation easements. Data were collected from three types of stakeholder groups, including land preservation program administrators in Delaware and Maryland, Delaware legislators, and Delaware landowners. The results show that these stakeholders believed <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>first</b> <b>refusal</b> was the most promising concept, and the groups identified some specific challenges to effective implementation. Targeting areas to implement the technique and having a dedicated, regular funding source were perceived to be essential. Agricultural conservation pensions were also viewed favorably, although some were skeptical {{that it could be}} implemented in practice. Tontines were perceived to be an interesting concept, but confusing, difficult to implement, and needing more work to flesh out details. Term easements were, for the most part, not viewed favorably. Most saw term easements having the fatal shortcoming of impermanent preservation. A fiscal analysis was preformed to demonstrate how additional funding for innovative techniques might complement continued purchase of agricultural conservation easements (PACE) activities. The results show that the conservation pension might preserve more acres than PACE, while <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>first</b> <b>refusal</b> will preserve less, but more threatened, acres. Term easements should preserve many more acres than PACE, albeit temporarily. The land preservation tontine will likely act to increase the value of land maintained in agricultural land use, but will not preserve land {{in the same manner as}} the other three techniques. Hence, land preservation tontines might best be viewed as a complement to the other preservation techniques. The Delaware Agricultural Lands Preservation Progra...|$|R

Furthermore, strategic rights and termination rights held by pharmaceutical firms are shown to be substitutes, and the level of substitution is affected by the uncertainty of the R&D activities involved and the previous relationship between contracting parties. These results can be explained by a multi-task theory where bio-tech agents allocate effort between R&D activities specified in contracts and non-contracted R&D activities. postprin...|$|R

40|$|Intertidal clam {{fisheries}} seem ideal {{candidates for}} the devolution of management authority from government to local stakeholders. In St. Mary's Bay, Nova Scotia, a private firm recently applied for a 10 -year renewal of a large (1, 627 ha) lease for quahog clam aquaculture. This case study examines the challenges of implementing community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) in rural fisheries within a broad integrated coastal management (ICM) institutional environment that favours corporate stakeholders. The challenges facing clam harvesters in rural Digby Neck, Nova Scotia arise from poor communication and coordination within government and between government and communities, as well as higher-level policy conflicts. The most important challenge arises from 'stealth privatization' of clam beaches. A single firm was granted <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>first</b> <b>refusal</b> to depurate all clams harvested from closed (polluted) beaches in the region, resulting in the de facto privatization of all (polluted and unpolluted) clam beaches. Experiences {{in other parts of}} Canada suggest there may be community-based governance approaches that avoid the pitfalls associated with corporate management of clam beaches.
