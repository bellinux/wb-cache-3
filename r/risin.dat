40|$|Since 2009, {{wealth in}} the U. S. farm sector has surged along with booming {{farmland}} values. Similar to nonfarm households, farm enterprises historically have used wealth to support consumption and investments when income fades. During years of low income, farmers tap their existing wealth to finance spending on capital investments such as buildings, vehicles, machinery and other equipment. Thus, similar to nonfarm households, the wealth effect often leads to sharp increases in debt and leverage in farm enterprises. Historically, the sharp accumulation of debt has preceded financial crises. After farm booms in the 1910 s and 1970 s, lower incomes and higher interest rates contributed to farm financial crises and waves of farm bankruptcies during the 1920 s and 1980 s. <b>Risin...</b>|$|E

40|$|Participants: Representative {{sample of}} 1000 individuals.

Results: Support for obesity prevention {{with a focus}} on behavioural change in children (89. 7 %) and provision of information in adults (82. 2 %) was substantial, but regulations were less supported (42. 2 %). Predictors of prevention support were attributing causes of obesity to the food environment and lack of physical activity, greater problem identification, societal responsibility beliefs and sociodemographic characteristics including female gender and higher age.

40|$|Abstract: Current tissue {{engineering}} techniques have various drawbacks: they often incorporate uncontrolled and imprecise scaffold geometries, whereas the current conventional cell seeding techniques result mostly in random cell placement rather than uniform cell distribution. For the successful reconstruction of deficient tissue, new material engineering approaches {{have to be}} considered to overcome current limitations.

This method is especially advantageous for stem cells since a controlled environment can be created to influence cell growth and differentiation.

To better understand the immunopathology of MAC disease and to identify molecules that may have potential diagnostic and vaccine utility, an immunoreactive M. intracellulare protein (MI 43) and the gene encoding this antigen were characterized. Southern blot hybridizations demonstrated that MI 43 gene probes reacted only with genomic DNA from M. intracellulare, M. avium, and Mycobacterium asiaticum and not with DNA isolated from 11 other mycobacterial species. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the M 143 gene encodes a 27 -kDa protein which contains a consensus bacterial lipoprotein processing sequence. Detergent-phase separations and metabolic labeling with [3 Hlpalmitate also suggested that MI 43 is a lipoprotein.

40|$|The United States {{experienced}} an unprecedented financial crisis after 2007. This paper analyzes if retirees had enough wealth built up {{to weather the}} financial risks that materialized in the crisis. Financial risks associated with saving for retirement had increasingly shifted onto individuals away from the public and employers during the decades before the crisis. This growing personal responsibility should have gone along with more saving and less risk taking. I use data from the Federal Reserve’s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances to first define an income threshold for retirees, specifically whether annuity income is greater than twice the poverty line – a common proxy for basic income needs. I then calculate the potential retirement income that retirees could expect if they translated all of their wealth into income and if the income is adjusted for market, idiosyncratic, and longevity risks. I compare the potential risk-adjusted income for retirees with annuity income above twice the poverty line to those retirees with annuity income below twice the poverty line. Both groups of retirees {{should have at least}} the same level of risk-adjusted potential retirement income. This comparison shows, however, that retirees with annuity income below twice the poverty line did not build up sufficient wealth to compensate for the <b>risin...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{long-term}} fiscal projections is self evident. Of these projections, pension expenditure {{is one of}} the most important since firstly it represents a large share of total expenditure, and secondly because of the positive correlation between this variable and demographic change. In this paper, we develop a model to project contributory pension expenditures in the Spanish Social Security System disaggregating the results by pension category and sex. The most salient of the results obtained is the expected steady growth of total expenditure in contributory pensions. This would lie around 15 per cent of GDP around 2045 compared to its initial level of barely 8 per cent. By pension categories, retirement pensions are those that determine the tendency of total expenditure evolution. Interesting conclusions can also be extracted from the analysis by sex. For instance, contrary to what one could expect, the projection shows a higher growth of the number of contributory pensions accruing to men. 1 Introduction: the importance of the long-term pension expenditure projections The concern about the need to make long-term fiscal projections can be dated back to the mid- 1980 s, just when the problem of demographic change began to emerge in industrialized countries.

40|$|The action {{potential}} of the unmyelinated nerve is metabolically expensive. In the neuropil of neocortex, where axons must be unmyelinated if each one is to make several thousand sequential or neighboring synapses, the metabolic costs are surprisingly large. Attwell and Laughlin (2001) estimate that 75 % of the ATP consumed by neurons in the rat brain is used for signaling. Of this 75 %, the majority {{is used by the}} unmyelinated axons. This metabolic perspective contrasts with and, as we will see, ultimately complements Hodgkin’s conjectured constraint on {{action potential}} velocity. Both Hodgkin (1975) and Adrian (1975) proposed that the gating-charge movement, which inevitably accompanies rapid activation of a voltage-dependent channel, leads to an optimal density of fast Na + channels. This optimization occurs because the movement of charge specifically restricted to the transmembrane voltage field contributes, albeit transiently, to membrane capacitance. Since increasing capacitance slows action potential propagation, Hodgkin proposed that the Na + channel density has evolved to maximize velocity. Unfortunately, although the maximum velocity exists, biophysical parameter sweeps do not support the evolutionary conjecture. In a simple Hodgkin-Huxley model reparameterized to fit the action potential velocity with high precision, the conjecture misses by two-fold. When a more sophisticated model, i. e., one that takes into account that as many as six equivalent charges move across the membrane but are only sequentially available., the conjecture fails with more than a four-fold error. Using the perspective of metabolic cost, we analyze the cost of velocity and identify an optimization that has occurred in evolution. The energetic cost arising from an action potential is divided into three separate components (Figure 2) : (1) the depolarization of the <b>risin...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of organic carbon and inorganic nutrients in controlling bacterial production {{was investigated in}} two tropical lowland rivers draining undisturbed forested catchments. Glucose (C), ammonium (N), phosphate (P), leaf leachate, and algal leachate were added alone or combined to water collected from one clear-water (Cataniapo) and one black-water (Autana) river of the Middle Orinoco basin, and bacterial production (BP) was measured at 0, 8, 24, and 36 h of incubation. The rivers have low pH (3. 8 – 5. 9) and conductivity (6. 3 – 9. 1 �S cm� 1) and abundant nitrogen (total N, 273 – 314 �g L� 1) compared to phosphorus (total P, 3. 6 – 5. 5 �g L� 1). BP was significantly stimulated by additions of P, CP, NP, and CNP in both river waters. N or C alone or combined did not stimulate BP, suggesting that P rather than carbon is the primary limiting nutrient in these rivers. Higher responses to CNP and CP amendments (3 – 7 times over controls), compared to P and NP (1. 3 – 4 times over controls), indicate that carbon is an important secondary constraint to bacterial production. Responses to NP and P were more frequent in the Autana than in the Cataniapo, suggesting that bacteria in the clear-water river were less resource limited {{than those in the}} black-water river. Responses to added leaf leachate, which had high concentrations of P and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), were generally greater than responses to added algal leachate.
