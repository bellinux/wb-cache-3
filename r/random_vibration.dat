Traditional generators based on piezoelectric effect are built with linear oscillators made by a piezoelectric beam and a mass used to tune the resonance frequency on the predominant frequency of the vibrations spectrum. However, in most cases the ambient <b>random</b> <b>vibrations</b> have their energy distributed over a wide spectrum of frequencies, being rich especially at low frequency. Furthermore frequency tuning is not always possible due to geometrical/dynamical constraints.

50|$|Vibrating tables or shake {{tables are}} {{sometimes}} {{used to test}} products to determine or demonstrate their ability to withstand vibration. Testing of this type is commonly done in the automotive, aerospace, and defense industries. These machines are capable of producing three different types of vibration profile sine sweep, <b>random</b> <b>vibration,</b> and synthesized shock. In {{all three of these}} applications, the part under test will typically be instrumented with one or more accelerometers to measure component response to the vibration input. A sine sweep vibration profile typically starts vibrating at low frequency and increases in frequency at a set rate (measured in hertz per second or hertz per minute). The vibratory amplitude as measured in gs may increase or decrease as well. A sine sweep will find resonant frequencies in the part. A <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> profile will excite different frequencies along a spectrum at different times. Significant calculation goes into making sure that all frequencies get excited to within an acceptable tolerance band. A <b>random</b> <b>vibration</b> test suite may range anywhere from 30 seconds up to several hours. It is intended to synthesize the effect of, for example, a car driving over rough terrain or a rocket taking off. A synthesized shock pulse is a short duration high level vibration calculated as a sum of many half-sine waves covering a range of frequencies. It is intended to simulate the effects of an impact or explosion. A shock pulse test typically lasts less than a second. Vibrating tables can also be used in the packaging process in material handling industries to shake or settle a container so it can hold more product.|$|E

40|$|<b>Random</b> {{acceleration}} <b>vibration</b> {{specifications for}} subsystems, i. e. instruments, equipment, are most times based on measurement during acoustic noise tests on system level, i. e. a spacecraft and measured by accelerometers, {{placed in the}} neighborhood of the interface between spacecraft and subsystem. Tuned finite element models can be used to predict the random acceleration power spectral densities at other locations than available via the power spectral density measurements of the acceleration. The measured and predicted power spectral densities do represent the modal response characteristics of the system and show many peaks and valleys. The equivalent <b>random</b> acceleration <b>vibration</b> test specification is a smoothed, enveloped, peak-clipped version of the measured and predicted power spectral densities of the acceleration spectrum. The original acceleration vibration spectrum can be characterized by a different number response spectra: Shock Response Spectrum (SRS), Extreme Response Spectrum (ERS), Vibration Response Spectrum (VRS), and Fatigue Damage Spectrum (FDS). An additional method of non-stationary <b>random</b> <b>vibrations</b> is based on the Rayleigh distribution of peaks. The response spectra represent the responses of series of SDOF systems excited at the base by random acceleration, both in time and frequency domain. The synthesis of equivalent <b>random</b> acceleration <b>vibration</b> specifications can be done in a very structured manner and are more suitable than equivalent <b>random</b> acceleration <b>vibration</b> specifications obtained by simple enveloping. In the synthesis process Miles’ equation plays a dominant role to invert the response spectra into equivalent <b>random</b> acceleration <b>vibration</b> spectra. A procedure is proposed {{to reduce the number of}} data point in the response spectra curve by dividing the curve in a numbers of fields. The synthesis to an equivalent random acceleration spectrum is performed on a reduced selected set of data points. The recalculated response spectra curve envelops the original response spectra curves. A real life measured random acceleration spectrum (PSD) with quite a number of peaks and valleys is taken to generate, applying response spectra SRS, ERS, VRS, FDS and the Rayleigh distribution of peaks, equivalent <b>random</b> acceleration <b>vibration</b> specifications. Computations are performed both in time and frequency domain...|$|R
