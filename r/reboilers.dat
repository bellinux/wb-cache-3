In chemical plants and refineries, <b>reboilers</b> used to heat incoming feed for distillation towers are often heat exchangers.|$|E
50|$|Thermosyphon <b>reboilers</b> (Image 2) do {{not require}} pumping of the column bottoms liquid into the reboiler. Natural {{circulation}} is obtained by using the density difference between the reboiler inlet column bottoms liquid and the reboiler outlet liquid-vapor mixture to provide sufficient liquid head to deliver the tower bottoms into the reboiler. Thermosyphon <b>reboilers</b> (also known as calandrias) are more complex than kettle <b>reboilers</b> and require more attention from the plant operators. There are many types of thermosyphon <b>reboilers</b> including vertical, horizontal, once-through or recirculating.|$|E
50|$|The most {{critical}} element of reboiler design is {{the selection of}} the proper type of reboiler for a specific service. Most <b>reboilers</b> are of the shell and tube heat exchanger type and normally steam is used as the heat source in such <b>reboilers.</b> However, other heat transfer fluids like hot oil or Dowtherm (TM) may be used. Fuel-fired furnaces may also be used as <b>reboilers</b> in some cases.|$|E
50|$|All five Class 10A {{locomotives}} {{were eventually}} <b>reboilered</b> with Watson Standard no. 1 boilers. Since the original {{difference between the}} Class 10A and Class 10B lay only {{in the fact that}} their respective boilers were constructed without or with superheaters, distinction between the two types became unnecessary after this <b>reboilering.</b> The <b>reboilered</b> Class 10A locomotives were therefore reclassified to Class 10BR along with similarly <b>reboilered</b> Class 10B locomotives.|$|R
50|$|All thirty Class 12B {{locomotives}} {{were eventually}} <b>reboilered</b> with Watson Standard no. 2 boilers. In the process, {{they were also}} equipped with Watson cabs with their distinctive slanted fronts, compared to the conventional vertical fronts of their original cabs. Upon <b>reboilering,</b> the unknown original reason for the separate classification was ignored and instead of becoming Class 12BR, the <b>reboilered</b> locomotives were reclassified to Class 12R along with the <b>reboilered</b> Class 12 locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Proper <b>reboiler</b> {{operation}} {{is vital to}} effective distillation. In a typical classical distillation column, all the vapor driving the separation comes from the <b>reboiler.</b> The <b>reboiler</b> receives a liquid stream from the column bottom and may partially or completely vaporize that stream. Steam usually provides the heat required for the vaporization.|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{condition}} of the feed may be altered to reduce the <b>reboiler</b> duty. However, {{only a portion of}} the thermal energy given to the feed reduces the <b>reboiler</b> duty. By splitting the feed and altering the thermal {{condition of}} a part of the feed, it is possible to achieve reduction only in the <b>reboiler</b> duty (100 % preheat efficiency). Based on the thermodynamic analysis of a distillation column, a methodology is developed to target split fraction of the feed for preheating to obtain reduction only in the <b>reboiler</b> duty...|$|R
5000|$|A {{particular}} {{case for the}} LMTD are condensers and <b>reboilers,</b> where the latent heat associated to phase change is a special case of the hypothesis. For a condenser, the hot fluid inlet temperature is then equivalent to the hot fluid exit temperature.|$|E

50|$|If {{the piping}} of a {{thermosiphon}} resists flow, or excessive heat is applied, the liquid may boil. Since the gas is more buoyant than the liquid, the convective pressure is greater.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the effects}} of the {{reaction}} models for the condenser and <b>reboiler</b> were investigated by carrying out rate-based simulations on the NH 3 -based CO 2 regeneration process. The predicted parameters in the regeneration process agree well with the experimental results when using the kinetic reaction model for both the condenser and <b>reboiler.</b> The chemistry model for the <b>reboiler</b> significantly underestimates the CO 2 output and overestimates the regeneration energy, but has little effects on the component concentrations in the gas product. When using the chemistry model for the <b>reboiler,</b> the underestimation of the CO 2 output mainly comes from the <b>reboiler</b> stage and it is due to that the HCO 3 − in the liquid phase does not decompose, but forms in the <b>reboiler</b> stage, while the overestimation of the regeneration energy not only comes from the underestimation of the CO 2 output, but also the overestimation of the <b>reboiler</b> heat duty, which is due to the higher predicted bottom temperature of the stripper. The chemistry model for the condenser only significantly underestimates the NH 3 concentration in the gas product...|$|R

50|$|<b>Reboilers</b> are heat {{exchangers}} typically {{used to provide}} heat {{to the bottom of}} industrial distillation columns.

50|$|Kettle <b>reboilers</b> (Image 1) {{are very}} simple and reliable. They may require pumping {{of the column}} bottoms liquid into the kettle, or there may be {{sufficient}} liquid head to deliver the liquid into the reboiler. In this reboiler type, steam flows through the tube bundle and exits as condensate. The liquid {{from the bottom of}} the tower, commonly called the bottoms, flows through the shell side. There is a retaining wall or overflow weir separating the tube bundle from the reboiler section where the residual reboiled liquid (called the bottoms product) is withdrawn, so that the tube bundle is kept covered with liquid and reduce the amount of low-boiling compounds in the bottoms product.|$|E
5000|$|However, ionic {{components}} {{of carbon dioxide}} are far less dangerous to corrosion than the ions of the saline components, e.g. Cl-. In order to obtain a selective conductivity value for these saline-containing ions (with the maximum potential for corrosion), all remaining carbon dioxide must {{be removed from the}} sample in order to accurately determine the presence of corrosive ions. There are generally two methods for removing carbon dioxide from the water sample: use of a reboiler to heat the sample and expel the CO2, and use of inert gasses. In the latter method, an inert gas which does not contain CO2 is passed through the sample water, whereby the gas components in the sample water are displaced by the gas {{components of}} the inert gas. Use of bottled inert gases can be problematic in some industrial applications. <b>Reboilers</b> are very efficient degassing with results over 92%, but they typically require anywhere from 20-45 minutes to achieve useful results.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The optimal {{design of}} {{reactive}} complex distillation systems {{is a highly}} nonlinear and multivariable problem, and the objective function used as optimization criterion is generally nonconvex with several local optimums and subject to several constraints. The esterification of lauric acid and methanol is explored using thermally coupled distillation sequences with side columns and with a minimum number of <b>reboilers.</b> The product of the esterification {{can be used as}} biodiesel. This is a major step forward since thermally coupled reactive distillation sequences with side columns and with a minimum number of <b>reboilers</b> offer significant benefits, such as the following: reductions on both capital investment and operating costs due to the absence of the <b>reboilers</b> and higher conversion and selectivity since products are removed as they are produced as well as no occurrence of thermal degradation of the products due to a lower temperature profile in the column. In this work, we have studied the design of reactive distillation with thermal coupling with a minimum number of <b>reboilers,</b> using differential evolution with restrictions coupled to AspenONE Aspen Plus. Also, we have analyzed the control properties of the reactive distillation schemes studied, and the results indicate that the energy requirements and the total annual cost of the complex distillation sequences with a minimum number of <b>reboilers</b> are reduced significantly in comparison with the conventional reactive distillation process and can be also achieved without significant control problems. 1...|$|E

40|$|Thermosyphon <b>reboilers</b> {{represent}} effectively a pumpless system, {{in which}} natural, gravity-assisted circulation takes place. Although these units {{are the most}} commonly used in the chemical industry, Arneth and Stichlmair (2001), their operation has only been considered within the context of wider experimental programmes with few studies conducted below atmospheric pressure. In addition, previous research carried out to determine the operating characteristics of thermosyphon <b>reboilers</b> decoupled the problems related to heat transfer into a tube side and a shell side, usually by means of an electrically heated single tube (uniform heating). Thus, it is of paramount importance to look at the coupled problem to obtain better estimates of the heat transfer coefficients for the condensing steam in the shell and the heated process fluid in the tubes. The work described in the present article is carried out in this context and provides a detailed description of a mathematical model developed to predict the steady-state performance of a vertical thermosyphon reboiler. A number of operating variables have been predicted. Analysis of these predictions and comparisons with the generated experimental data, reported by Alane and Heggs (2007), resulted in good agreement. The resultant model could be used for optimisation studies on existing thermosyphon <b>reboilers</b> and the design of new ones. 1...|$|E
