40|$|Various holonomy {{phenomena}} {{are shown}} to be instances of the reconstruction procedure for mechanical systems with symmetry. We systematically exploit {{this point of view}} for fixed systems (for example with controls on the internal, or reduced, variables) and for slowly moving systems in an adiabatic context. For the latter, we obtain the phases as the holonomy for a connection which synthesizes the Cartan connection for moving mechanical systems with the Hannay-Berry connection for integrable systems. This synthesis allows one to treat in a natural way examples like the ball in the slowly <b>rotating</b> <b>hoop</b> and also non-integrable mechanical systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{evergreen}} {{problem of}} a bead on a <b>rotating</b> <b>hoop</b> shows a multitude of bifurcations when the bead moves with friction. This motion is studied for different values of the damping coefficient and rotational speeds of the hoop. Phase portraits and trajectories corresponding to all different modes of motion of the bead are presented. They illustrate the rich dynamics associated with this simple system. For some range of values of the damping coefficient and rotational speeds of the hoop, linear stability analysis of the equilibrium points is inadequate to classify their nature. A technique involving transformation of coordinates and order of magnitude arguments is presented to examine such cases. This may provide a general framework to investigate other complex systems. 2 I...|$|E
50|$|Sky Zone is the {{creation}} of entrepreneur Rick Platt, who originally intended for the trampoline courts to be used as part of a new sport with professional athletes. In 2004, Platt spent USD$2 million to build a 17000 sqfoot m2 trampoline arena in Las Vegas and to hire athletes for the sport, which would have included <b>rotating</b> <b>hoops</b> and mid-air acrobatics. The sport failed to generate interest, but local skateboarders learned of the facility and wanted to bounce on the court, which prompted Platt to open the facility to the general public at the cost of $8 per person. Within six months, the facility had hosted 10,000 visitors, and total revenue for the first year was $412,000.|$|R
40|$|The {{motion of}} {{a bead on}} a <b>rotating</b> {{circular}} <b>hoop</b> is investigated using elementary calculus and simple symmetry arguments. The peculiar trajectories of the bead at different speeds of rotation of the hoop are presented. Phase portraits and nature of fixed points are studied. Bifurcation is observed with change in the rotational speed of the hoop. At a critical speed of rotation of the hoop, there appears an interesting relation between the time period and amplitude of oscillation of the bead. The study introduces several important aspects of nonlinear dynamics. It is suitable for students having basic understanding in elementary calculus and classical mechanics...|$|R
50|$|The next {{breakthrough}} in rapid tuning came around 1815 when Johann Stumpff, a musician and inventor from Amsterdam invented {{a way for}} a drum's pitch to be changed by physically rotating the instrument. Similar to Cramer's design, rods attached the counter hoop to a metal ring below the bowl. Unlike Cramer's design, Stumpff added a second metal ring that {{was attached to the}} legs supporting the kettle. The bottom ring was threaded and a long bolt extended {{from the base of the}} drum up through the threaded ring and attached to the second ring. As the bowl and counter <b>hoop</b> <b>rotated,</b> the counter <b>hoop</b> would move up and down but the bowl would remain stationary. This allowed for different levels of tension to be placed on the counter hoop and, as a result, produced different pitches. This invention was popular because it was cheap to manufacture, worked well, and was easy to transport, which made these drums ideal for traveling orchestras. However, the fact that players had to put down the mallets before rotating the drums was a major drawback.|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{to measure the}} noise shielding of the blended wing body design concept was developed using a simplified wedge-shaped airframe. The experimental {{study was conducted in}} the Langley Anechoic Noise Research Facility. A wideband, omnidirective sound source in a simulated engine nacelle was held at locations representative of a range of engine locations above the wing. The sound field around the model was measured with the airframe and source in place and with source alone, using an-array of microphones on a <b>rotating</b> <b>hoop</b> that is also translated along an axis parallel to the airframe axis. The insertion loss was determined from {{the difference between the two}} resulting contours. Although no attempt was made to simulate the noise characteristics of a particular engine, the broadband noise source radiated sound over a range of scaled frequencies encompassing 1 and 2 times the blade passage frequency representative of a large, high-bypass-ratio turbofan engine. The measured data show that significant shielding of the inlet-radiated noise is obtained in the area beneath and upstream of the model. The data show the sensitivity of insertion loss to engine location...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design of}} a guidance device for faster and more accurate targeting of multiple probes during cryoablation and other percutaneous interventions performed in closed bore magnetic resonance (MR) imaging systems. The device is intended to be mounted onto a Siemens 110 mm MR loop coil that rests on the patient and contains a cable driven two-degree-of- freedom spherical mechanism that orientates the intervention probes about a remote center of motion located 15 mm above the skin entry point. A carriage, pulled by strong and low stretch cables, can position up to three intervention probes as it travels on a <b>rotating</b> <b>hoop.</b> Its motion is constrained by a custom designed roller bearing to minimize friction. A thumbscrew fastened latch allows a probe to be engaged in a guide that constrains the probe along a specific trajectory. The probe can also be disengaged from its track, freeing it to move with respiration and enabling the guide to be repositioned for another probe to be inserted. Compact MR compatible piezoelectric motors are used to actuate the system. A prototype was built from 3 D printed ABS plastic as a proof of concept. Bench level evaluation demonstrated that each component of the device performs according to the design specifications. The device performance was characterized by analyzing still images taken before and after movement, which yielded sub-degree accuracy, sub-degree repeatability near vertical position, and an incremental step resolution of at least 0. 5 degree. Upon further developments of the registration and calibration modules in 3 D slicer to interface the robot with image data, evaluation of the device in MRI will be performed. by Faye Y. Wu.

25|$|Hooping (also called hula hooping or hoop dance) {{generally}} {{refers to}} manipulation of and artistic movement or dancing with a hoop (or hoops). Hoops {{can be made}} of metal, wood, or plastic. Hooping combines technical moves and tricks with freestyle or technical dancing. Hooping can be practiced to or performed with music. In contrast to the classic toy hula hoop, modern hoopers use heavier and larger diameter <b>hoops,</b> and frequently <b>rotate</b> the <b>hoop</b> around {{parts of the body}} other than the waist, including the hips, chest, neck, shoulders, thighs, knees, arms, hands, thumbs, feet, and toes. The hoop can also be manipulated and rotated off the body as well. Modern hooping has been influenced by art forms such as rhythmic gymnastics, hip-hop, freestyle dance, fire performance, twirling, poi, and other dance and movement forms.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a simple mechanical system that involves Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking. The system {{consists of two}} beads constrained to slide along a hoop and attached each other through a spring. When the <b>hoop</b> <b>rotates</b> about a fixed axis, the spring-beads system will change its equilibrium position {{as a function of}} the angular velocity. The system shows two different regions of symmetry separated by a critical point analogous to a second order transition. The competitive balance between the rotational diynamics and the interaction of the spring causes an Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking just as the balance between temperature and the spin interaction causes a transition in a ferromagnetic system. In addition, the gravitational potential act as an external force that causes explicit symmetry breaking and a feature of first-order transition. Near the transition point, the system exhibits a universal critical behavior where the changes of the parameter of order is described by the critical exponent beta = 1 / 2 and the susceptibility by gamma = 1. We also found a chaotic behavior near the critical point. Through a demostrative device we perform some qualitative observations that describe important features of the system.

40|$|We {{describe}} a simple mechanical system that {{operates as a}} ponderomotive particle trap, consisting of a circular hoop and a frictionless bead, with the <b>hoop</b> <b>rotating</b> about a horizontal axis lying in {{the plane of the}} hoop. The bead in the frame of the hoop is thus exposed to an effective sinusoidally-varying gravitational field. This field's component along the hoop is a zero at the top and bottom. In the same frame, the bead experiences a time-independent centrifugal force that is zero at the top and bottom as well. The system is analyzed in the ideal case of small displacements from the minimum, and the motion of the particle is shown to satisfy the Mathieu equation. In the particular case that the axis of rotation is tangential to the hoop, the system is an exact analog for the rf Paul ion trap. Various complicating factors such as anharmonic terms, friction and noise are considered. A working model of the proposed system has been constructed, using a ball-bearing rolling in a tube along the outside of a section of a bicycle rim. The apparatus demonstrates in detail the operation of an rf Paul trap by reproducing the dynamics of trapped atomic ions and illustrating {{the manner in which the}} electric potential varies with time.

40|$|Deduce the {{location}} of the center of mass/energy of a hoop of rest mass m 0 and rest radius a when it rolls without slipping on a horizontal surface with speed v that is not negligible compared to the speed of light c. 2 Solution This problem is taken from sec. VII- 5 of [1]. In the first approximation the center of mass is at x = vt, y = 0, supposing the hoop rolls with speed v in the x-direction on the surface y = −a. However, the top of the rolling hoop has higher speed (≈ 2 v) than the bottom (which is instantaneously at rest in the lab frame, so the relativistic mass (= energy/c 2,wherec is the speed of light in vacuum) of an element of the hoop is larger at larger y, and the center of mass/energy is above its geometric center (x, y) =(vt, 0). We suppose that the hoop is a “rigid ” body in the following sense. The ⋆ frame is defined to be the inertial frame that moves in the x-direction at velocity v = v ˆx with respect to the lab frame, with the geometric center of the hoop at the origin in this frame. We take the hoop to be a circle of radius a in the ⋆ frame. The <b>hoop</b> <b>rotates</b> with angular velocity ω ⋆ = −ω ˆz about the z-axis, where ω = v/a. The relativistic mass (= energy/c 2) m ⋆ of the hoop in the ⋆ frame is m ⋆ = γm 0, where γ...|$|R
40|$|Electricity is {{critical}} to our economy, but growth in demand has saturated the power grid causing instability and blackouts. The economic penalty due to lost productivity in the US exceeds $ 100 billion per year. Opposition to new transmission lines and power plants, environmental restrictions, and an expected $ 100 billion grid upgrade cost have slowed system improvements. Flywheel electricity storage could provide a more economical, environmentally benign alternative and slash economic losses if units could be scaled up in a cost effective manner to much larger power and capacity than the present maximum {{of a few hundred}} kW and a few kWh per flywheel. The goal of this project is to design, construct, and demonstrate a small-scale third generation electricity storage flywheel using a revolutionary architecture scalable to megawatt-hours per unit. First generation flywheels are built from bulk materials such as steel and provide inertia to smooth the motion of mechanical devices such as engines. They can be scaled up to tens of tons or more, but have relatively low energy storage density. Second generation flywheels use similar designs but are fabricated with composite materials such as carbon fiber and epoxy. They are capable of much higher energy storage density but cannot economically be built larger than a few kWh of storage capacity due to structural and stability limitations. LaunchPoint is developing a third generation flywheel — the "Power Ring" — with energy densities as high or higher than second generation flywheels and a totally new architecture scalable to enormous sizes. Electricity storage capacities exceeding 5 megawatt-hours per unit appear both technically feasible and economically attractive. Our design uses a new class of magnetic bearing – a radial gap “shear-force levitator” – that we discovered and patented, and a thin-walled composite <b>hoop</b> <b>rotated</b> at high speed to store kinetic energy. One immediate application is power grid frequency regulation, where Power Rings could cut costs, reduce fuel consumption, eliminate emissions, and reduce the need for new power plants. Other applications include hybrid diesel-electric locomotives, grid power quality, support for renewable energy, spinning reserve, energy management, and facility deferral. Decreased need for new generation and transmission alone could save the nation $ 2. 5 billion per year. Improved grid reliability could cut economic losses due to poor power quality by {{tens of billions of dollars}} per year. A large export market for this technology could also develop. Power Ring technology will directly support the EERE mission, and the goals of the Distributed Energy Technologies Subprogram in particular, by helping to reduce blackouts, brownouts, electricity costs, and emissions, by relieving transmission bottlenecks, and by greatly improving grid power quality...|$|R
