40|$|Studies of the {{fundamental}} processes of combustion are usually concerned with wide ranges of investigation of individual processes. In general, each fundamental combustion process may be studied {{in an environment that}} is most suited to its evaluation and possibly unrelated basically to any practical application. The majority of the data presented in volume I of this series concern {{the fundamental}} aspects of combustion as functions of the individual occurrence of various contributing processes. In a jet engine, however, the various fundamental combustion processes may occur simultaneously and may interact. Furthermore, the engine environment usually does not permit independent variation of single combustion parameters, since specified operating conditions impose specific values on the parameters. In volume II, data are presented to show the effect of operating conditions on the over-all combustion process in different combustion components. To show the effect of operating conditions, it is necessary to specify the range of these conditions within which combustion components may operate. Therefore, this chapter presents only the operating conditions that might be required in the primary combustors and afterburners of typical current turbojet engines. (Corresponding information on <b>ram-jet</b> <b>engines</b> is presented in ch. xisi.) This chapter is not intended to serve as an explanation of engine operation. The operating conditions of the combustion components are presented in terms of total pressures and temperatures at the primary-combustor and afterburner inlets, reference velocities and outlet total temperatures of the primary combustors, and velocities at the plane of the flameholder in the afterburners. The data are presented to relate the operating regions of typical current turbojet combustion components to flight altitudes, Mach numbers, and modes of engine operation. Specifically, data are presented for the combustion parameters of the primary combustor and afterburner of three turbojet engines having rated compressor total-pressure ratios of 5, 8, and 12 under full-throttle conditions.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{method for}} evaluating the stability characteristics and the amplitude {{and the frequency of}} pulsation of ram-jet engines without heat addition is presented herein. Experimental verification of the theoretical results are included where data were available. Theory and experiment show that the pulsation amplitude of a high mass-flow-ratio diffuser having no cone surface flow separation increases with decreasing mass flow. The theoretical trends for changes in amplitude, frequency, and mean-pressure recovery with changes in plenum-chamber volume were experimentally confirmed. For perforated convergent-divergent-type diffusers, a stability hysteresis loop was predicted on the pressure-recovery mass-flow-ratio curve. At a given mean mass-flow ratio, the higher. value of mean pressure recovery corresponded to oscillatory flow in the diffuser while the lower branch was stable. This hysteresis has been observed experimentally. The theory indicates that for a <b>ram-jet</b> <b>engine</b> of given diameter, the amplitude of pulsation of a supersonic diffuser is increased by decreasing the relative size of the plenum chamber with respect to the diffuser volume down to a critical value at which oscillations cease. In the region of these critical values, the stable mass-flow range of the diffuser may be increased either by decreasing the combustion chamber volume or by increasing the length of the diffuser...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of the XRJ 43 -MA- 3 flight-weight <b>ram-jet</b> <b>engine</b> has been investigated in a free-jet facility {{as part of the}} development program for the "Bomarc," ram-jet powered, interceptor-type missile. The engine performance was obtained at Mach number s of 2. 35, 2. 50, and 2. 70, altitudes from 50, 000 to 75, 000 feet, and Miami hot day and cold day inlet temperatures at an angle of attack of + 4 deg. At each flight condition investigated, the engine control set an inner-ring fuel flow which was held constant as outer-ring fuel flow was varied. Combustion screech, which occurred more readily at the higher combustor pressures, fuel-air ratios, and inlet temperatures, resulted in discontinuities in the performance curves and an improvement in engine performance. The maximum time that the engine was allowed to operate continuously in the screech region was approximately 4 minutes. For these periods of time at the pressure levels investigated, no serious damage was evident. At a given fuel-air ratio, increasing the altitude or inlet temperature in the range investigated resulted in small reductions in net thrust coefficient. An increase in the flight Mach number raised the combustion efficiency but had little effect on the net thrust coefficient. Because conditions external to the engine did not simulate the actual flight conditions, no valid check of the durability of the combustion chamber and exhaust nozzle was obtained. All other engine components operated satisfactorily at least for at total burning time of 5 hours and high fuel-air-ratio operation of 35 minutes...|$|E
40|$|A <b>ram-jet</b> <b>engine</b> with an {{experimental}} 48 -inch-diameter combustor {{was investigated in}} a free-jet facility. The combustor design comprised a large-volume annular pilot region {{and an array of}} sloping baffle- or gutter-type flameholders. The combustor was intended to operate at a fuel-air ratio of about 0. 037. To promote combustion efficiency at such low fuel-air ratios, a divided-flow system was employed which bypassed a portion of the engine air around the combustion region. Three combustor lengths, three lengths of the shroud which separated the bypass air from the burning stream, and four fuel-distribution systems were investigated over a range of fuel-air ratios from 0. 025 to 0. 055 and a range of engine air flows from 40 to 110 pounds per second (combustor-outlet total pressures from 500 t o 1800 lb/sq ft abs). The highest efficiencies were obtained with a combustor length of 78 inches and a shroud length of 6 inches. At the lowest air flow, with combustor pressures of about 700 pounds per square foot absolute, a maximum efficiency of about 93 percent was obtained. The efficiency increased with combustor length, a typical increase being from 88 to 95 percent as the length increased from 60 to 96 inches. The length of the shroud separating the bypass air from the burning stream affected not only the efficiency level, but also the fuel-air ratio at which the maximum efficiency occurred. In general, a longer shroud caused the maximum efficiency to occur at lower f'uel-air ratios. Highest efficiencies usually resulted from the use of a fuel-injection system giving a uniform fuel profile. The efficiency at low fuel-air ratios could be considerably improved by the use of a radially nonuniform fuel profile which concentrated the fuel towards the outermost portion of the burning stream The total-pressure ratio across the combustor was about 0. 86 at the design point.

40|$|The ram jet is {{basically}} {{one of the}} most dimple types of aircraft engine. It consists only of an inlet diffuser, a combustion system, and an exit nozzle. A typical ram-jet configuration is shown in figure 128. The engine operates on the Brayton cycle, and ideal cycle efficiency depends only on the ratio of engine to ambient pressure. The increased, engine pressures are obtained by ram action alone, and for this reason the ram jet has zero thrust at zero speed. Therefore, ram-jet-powered aircraft must be boosted to flight speeds close to a Mach number of 1. 0 before appreciable thrust is generated by the engine. Since pressure increases are obtained by ram action alone, combustor-inlet pressures and temperatures are controlled by the flight speed, the ambient atmospheric condition, and by the efficiency of the inlet diffuser. These pressures and temperatures, as functions of flight speed and altitude, are shown in figure 129 for the NACA standard atmosphere and for practical values of diffuser efficiency. It can be seen that very wide ranges of combustor-inlet temperatures and pressures may be encountered over the ranges of flight velocity and altitude at which ram jets may be operated. Combustor-inlet temperatures from 500 degrees to 1500 degrees R and inlet pressures from 5 to 100 pounds per square inch absolute represent the approximate ranges of interest in current combustor development work. Since the ram jet has no moving parts in the combustor outlet, higher exhaust-gas temperatures than those used in current turbojets are permissible. Therefore, fuel-air ratios equivalent to maximum rates of air specific impulse or heat release can be used, and, for hydrocarbon fuels, this weight ratio is about 0. 070. Lower fuel-air ratios down to about 0. 015 may also be required to permit efficient cruise operation. This fuel-air-ratio range of 0. 015 to 0. 070 used in ram jets can be compared with the fuel-air ratios up to 0. 025 encountered in current turbojets. Ram-jet combustor-inlet velocities range from 150 to 400 feet per second. These high linear velocities combined with the relatively low pressure ratios obtainable in ram jets require that the pressure drop through the combustor be kept low to avoid excessive losses in cycle efficiency. It has been estimated that, for a long-range <b>ram-jet</b> <b>engine,</b> an increase in pressure loss of one dynamic head would require a compensating 1 -percent increase in combustion efficiency. Therefore, combustor pressure-loss coefficients (pressure drop/impact pressure) of the order of 1 to 4 are found in most current engines. The operating conditions described impose major problems in the design of stable and efficient ram-jet combustion systems. This chapter presents a survey of ram-jet combustor research and, where possible, points out criteria that may be useful in the design of ram-jet combustion systems...|$|E
