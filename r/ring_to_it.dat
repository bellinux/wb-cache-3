500|$|Before {{talking with}} his brother, Max wrote a song {{entitled}} [...] "Inflikted," [...] inspired by Sepultura's visit in 1992 to Indonesia where {{they saw a}} [...] "crazy ritual". Describing what he saw, Max said, [...] "There was self-inflicted pain, knives, blood, fire. It was insane. It stuck in my head." [...] Max stated that [...] "Inflikted" [...] {{was supposed to go}} towards Soulfly's sixth studio album Conquer, but he wanted to do the song with Igor. For legal reasons, they could not use Inflikted as the band name. According to Max, [...] "A lot of people had used it before, so he {{had to come up with}} something else." [...] When trying to find a name, he [...] "blurted out" [...] Cavalera Conspiracy, and Igor liked it. Max added, [...] "I think I like it better than Inflikted. It has a <b>ring</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> that connects me and Igor as two brothers back together." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{three years}} of study with Berghof and Uta Hagen at the HB Studio, Charles Grodin told Wilder about Lee Strasberg's method acting. Grodin persuaded {{him to leave the}} studio and begin {{studying}} with Strasberg in his private class. Several months later, Wilder was accepted into the Actors Studio. Feeling that [...] "Jerry Silberman in Macbeth" [...] did not have the right <b>ring</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> he adopted a stage name. He chose [...] "Wilder" [...] because it reminded him of Our Town author Thornton Wilder, while [...] "Gene" [...] came from Thomas Wolfe's first novel, Look Homeward, Angel. He also liked [...] "Gene" [...] because as a boy, he was impressed by a distant relative, a World War II bomber navigator who was [...] "handsome and looked great in his leather flight jacket." [...] He later said that he could not see Gene Wilder playing Macbeth, either. After joining the Actors Studio, he slowly began to be noticed in the off-Broadway scene, thanks to performances in Sir Arnold Wesker's Roots and in Graham Greene's The Complaisant Lover, for which Wilder received the Clarence Derwent Award for [...] "Best Performance by an Actor in a Nonfeatured Role." [...] One of Wilder's early stage credits was playing the socially awkward mental patient Billy Bibbit in the original 1963-64 Broadway adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest opposite star Kirk Douglas.|$|E

2500|$|Another account {{says that}} Jenkins met a Richmond, Virginia, man named W. Conway Twitty Jr. through Jenkins' manager in a New York City restaurant.

2500|$|The group's members {{first met}} {{in the year of}} 1987, when Sakurai, Tahara and Nakagawa were in [...] The Walls, which was {{originally}} influenced by the band Echoes. The frontman of Echoes, Jinsei Tsuji, was a political activist, and because of this, The Walls too became a political band. Drummer Hideya Suzuki was not an original member of The Walls. When the original drummer departed, the band recruited Suzuki, who went to the same school as the other members. In late 1988, The Walls disintegrated, while the remaining members formed Mr. Children in early 1989. The name of Mr. Children supposedly came about during a talk in a dinner, in which the group thought the word [...] "children" [...] had a nice <b>ring</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> but because they were no longer children themselves, they decided to add Mr. in front of it. They credit this change as a new way they started to look at the group.|$|E

He saw a face full of contradictions,--youthful, maidenly, and intelligent, yet touched with the unconscious melancholy which is born of disappointment and desire. The mouth was sweet and tender as a woman's should be, the brow spirited and thoughtful; but the eyes were by turns eager, absent, or sad, and there was much pride in the carriage of the small head with its hair of wavy gold gathered into a green snood, whence little tendrils kept breaking loose to dance upon her forehead, or hang about her neck. A most significant but not a beautiful face, because of its want of harmony. The dark eyes, among their fair surroundings, disturbed the sight as a discord in music jars upon the ear; even when the lips smiled the sombre shadow of black lashes seemed to fill them with a gloom that was never wholly lost.
