Belle admits the man she is leaving is {{overcome}} by evil yet she loves him. The Evil Queen offers the solution: true love's kiss will break the curse. Belle returns to Rumpelstiltskin's castle and the Dark one asks why {{she came back to}} him. She replies that she wasn't going to return but something changed her mind.

He throws Belle in his dungeon and smashes every cup against the wall but he cannot bring himself to destroy the chipped one. Once he has cooled off, he tells Belle to leave because his powers are more important to him than she is. Belle admonishes him for not believing she can love him. She warns him that he will regret his actions when all he has is an empty heart and a chipped cup.|$|E

25|$|There {{was now a}} tumult arisen at Alexandria, {{between the}} Jewish {{inhabitants}} and the Greeks; and three ambassadors were chosen out of each party that were at variance, who came to Gaius. Now one of these ambassadors from the people of Alexandria was Apion, (29) who uttered many blasphemies against the Jews; and, among other things that he said, he charged them with neglecting the honors that belonged to Caesar; for that while all who were subject to the Roman empire built altars and temples to Gaius, and in other regards universally received him as they received the gods, these Jews alone thought it a dishonorable thing for them to erect statues in honor of him, {{as well as to}} swear by his name. Many of these severe things were said by Apion, by which he hoped to provoke Gaius to anger at the Jews, as he was likely to be. But Philo, the principal of the Jewish embassage, a man eminent on all accounts, brother to Alexander the Alabarch, (30) and one not unskillful in philosophy, was ready to betake himself to make his defense against those accusations; but Gaius prohibited him, and bid him begone; he was also in such a <b>rage,</b> <b>that</b> it openly appeared he was about to do them some very great mischief. So Philo being thus affronted, went out, and said to those Jews who were about him, that they should be of good courage, since Gaius's words indeed showed anger at them, but in reality had already set God against himself.|$|E

500|$|According to scholar Robert Zecker, {{the novel}} depicts African-American poverty {{but does not}} {{illustrate}} its causes.

The African Americans do not forget the years of oppression they have endured. However, the Greek Americans, like other whites, fail {{to remember that the}} African Americans were assaulted by whites in 1943 and faced over two decades of oppression after that. Instead, Zecker noted that the characters in the novel believe that the 1967 Detroit riots are [...] "inexplicable cataclysms that came out of nowhere".|$|E

Another critic adds that, though Depp's voice [...] "does not have much heft or power", [...] "his ear is obviously excellent, because his pitch is dead-on accurate... Beyond his good pitch and phrasing, the expressive colorings of his singing are crucial to the portrayal. Beneath this Sweeney’s vacant, sullen exterior is a man consumed with a murderous <b>rage</b> <b>that</b> threatens to burst forth every time he slowly takes a breath and is poised to speak.

500|$|Santiago, {{rather than}} {{listening}} to popular radio, borrowed {{rock and roll}} records from the public library as he was growing up; he first discovered Les Paul and Jimi Hendrix, who led to jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery.

He discovered jazz and country artists such as Joe Pass and Chet Atkins after studying the liner notes of albums. [...] Santiago was directly influenced by the [...] "Hendrix chord", the sharp 9th dominant chord which, {{in the words of}} author Ben Sisario, [...] "tapped a hidden <b>rage</b> <b>that</b> matched the horror of Thompson's scream". As a teenager, Santiago also listened to classic rock and protopunk artists such as The Who, The Rolling Stones, The Velvet Underground and Iggy Pop.|$|E

Bryan and producer Tom DeSanto envisioned X2 as the film series' The Empire Strikes Back, in that the characters are [...] "all split apart, and then dissected, and revelations occur that are significant… the romance comes to fruition and a lot of things happen." [...] Producer Avi Arad announced a planned November 2002 theatrical release date, while David Hayter and Zak Penn were hired to write separate scripts. Hayter and Penn combined what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay. Singer and Hayter worked on another script, finishing in October 2001.|$|E

[...] Sady Doyle of The Atlantic interpreted these lyrics as the rapper's confession to having abused Scott, as he [...] "turns the anger and accusations toward himself". In the second verse, Eminem accepts the outcome after feeling sorry, admitting, [...] "Yesterday is over, it's a different day." [...] His frustration increases and he raps that two personalities can clash and devastate: [...] "maybe that's {{what happens when a}} tornado meets a volcano".
