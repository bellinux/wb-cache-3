40|$|AbstractThe plant-infecting mastreviruses (family Geminiviridae) express two {{distinct}} replication-initiator proteins, Rep and RepA. Although RepA {{is essential for}} systemic infectivity, {{little is known about}} its precise function. We therefore investigated its role in replication using 2 D-gel electrophoresis to discriminate the <b>replicative</b> <b>forms</b> of Maize streak virus (MSV) mutants that either fail to express RepA (RepA−), or express RepA that is unable to bind the plant retinoblastoma related protein, pRBR. Whereas amounts of viral DNA were reduced in two pRBR-binding deficient RepA mutants, their repertoires of <b>replicative</b> <b>forms</b> changed only slightly. While a complete lack of RepA expression was also associated with reduced viral DNA titres, the only traces of replicative intermediates of RepA− viruses were those indicative of recombination-dependent replication. We conclude that in MSV, RepA, but not RepA–pRBR binding, is necessary for single-stranded DNA production and efficient rolling circle replication...|$|R

40|$|Three {{species of}} {{double-stranded}} RNA (<b>replicative</b> <b>forms)</b> have been isolated from cells infected with Sindbis virus after treating the extracts with pancreatic ribonuclease. Their molecular weights have been {{estimated to be}} 8. 8 x 10 ^ 6, 6. 6 x 10 ^ 6 and 2. 9 x 10 ^ 6 daltons (RFI, RFII and RFIII, respectively). RFII and RFIII were found to exist in a one-to-one molar ratio throughout the infection cycle, although the total amounts of these <b>replicative</b> <b>forms</b> varied. The molar ratio of RF 1 {{to the other two}} <b>replicative</b> <b>forms</b> was different at various times after infection. However, {{in the middle of the}} virus life-cycle, from two to six hours post-infection, this ratio was constant at 0. 4 to 1. Sedimentation analysis of pulse-labeled RNA from Sindbis-infected cells indicated that all replicative intermediates had molecular weights greater than or equal to 8. 8 x 10 ^ 6 daltons. Since all three <b>replicative</b> <b>forms</b> were liberated from the peak of replicative intermediates by treatment with ribonuclease, this suggested that RFII and RFIII were joined together before digestion. The constant one-to-one molar ratio of RFII and RFIII supported this hypothesis. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that while RFI and RFIII were labeled equally rapidly, RFII was labeled some 20 to 50 times more slowly. Hybridization competition experiments showed that the minus strand of RFIII is complementary to 26 s RNA, a species of single-stranded RNA found in infected cells, and that the minus strand of RFII is complementary to the remainder of the 49 s viral genome. We postulate, therefore, that a precursor-product relation exists between RFI and 49 s RNA, between RFIII and 26 s RNA and between RFII and a third species of Sindbis-specific RNA, which we have not yet detected. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that two classes of replicative intermediates exist in Sindbis-infected cells. One serves as the template for the synthesis of 49 s RNA, and the second manufactures two smaller segments of viral-specific RNA...|$|R

Many positive strand RNA copies are produced from the single negative strand (6).

50|$|The single {{stranded}} DNA of {{the virus}} is converted into double stranded DNA by the host machinery. This form is called the <b>replicative</b> <b>form</b> (RF). The strand which came from the virus (VS) is nicked by the viral protein p2 (pII). Host DNA replication machinery then replicates the VS in a rolling circle form of replication by extending the 3' end of the nick, pushing out the 5' end as a single strand. P2 chops off the strand each time its extension completes a full circle and ligates the single stranded copy into a circle. These ssDNA circles are converted to dsDNA like the original viral genome and the RFs accumulate in the cell. The RFs are transcribed and viral proteins accumulate.

50|$|One key {{observation}} {{in support of}} a double-helical structure is that the individual single strands of small circular viral and plasmid DNA are inseparable under the usual types of denaturation conditions, supporting a plectonemic, i.e., twisted structure whose strands are topologically locked together. While human and bacterial chromosomes are far too large to isolate intact, but rather break into innumerable small fragments when extracted from their respective cells, there exist many species of small viral and plasmid chromosomes which because of their small sizes are stable in solution, and remain intact even with vigorous handling. Early studies quickly revealed that the strands of duplex circular chromosomes do not separate when subjected to conditions which readily denature linear DNA. For example, if calf thymus DNA (a heterogeneous collection of linear fragments) is merely boiled, the strands separate, and when slowly cooled, they re-anneal. In contrast, when the circular chromosomes of such organisms as the <b>replicative</b> <b>form</b> (RF) of the bacteriophage φX174, or the mammalian virus polyoma, are boiled, nothing at all happens to the native structure - they are completely resistant to thermal denaturation. Without a doubt, the single most skepticism-inspiring aspect of non-helical DNA theory was the failure of the strands of circular chromosomes to separate under conditions where the strands of linear DNA would readily do so. This was generally regarded as evidence that the strands were plectonemically wound together (i.e., topologically linked).|$|E

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} deletions in the hepatitis B virus pre-S 1 domain {{have been}} frequently found during persistent viral infection. In {{this study we}} have investigated the functional properties of a mutant viral genome that carries an in-frame deletion of 183 nucleotides in the pre-S 1 region. This deletion removes the promoter of the small envelope gene. Transfection into human hepatocellular carcinoma cells of a replication-competent construct containing this deletion resulted in an increase of intermediate DNA <b>replicative</b> <b>forms</b> compared to those produced by wild-type hepatitis B virus. Northern blot analysis revealed that such cells lack the 2. 1 -kb transcripts encoding the small envelope protein and that hepatitis B surface antigen was absent as well. Furthermore, nucleocapsids containing the genome with pre-S 1 deleted were not secreted, and the deleted large envelope protein was retained with the cytoplasm and exhibited a perinuclear pattern of distribution. However, coexpression with the small envelope protein was sufficient to restore virion secretion and to change the cellular distribution of the deleted large envelope protein. In addition, the creation of point mutations that prevent the synthesis of large or small envelope proteins also inhibited viral secretion and led to increased levels of hepatitis B virus intermediate <b>replicative</b> <b>forms</b> within the cell.
