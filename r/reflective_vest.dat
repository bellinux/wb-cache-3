As a result, Leon IV consolidated his influences into a functioning street installation program by placing road signs and altered adverts in broad daylight {{under the guise of}} a city ordained construction worker. Pivotal to the new process was Leon IV's childhood friend and artist Andre Hyland (a.k.a.

On September 11, 2001, when Clark saw a giant fireball in his peripheral vision, {{coming from the}} adjacent North Tower at 8:46 a.m., he quickly picked up his issued gear and began evacuation procedures for the staff on his floor of the South Tower. Clark went to his company's trading floor, which stood at {{the east side of}} his tower. When he arrived, he saw his co-workers peering out the windows, watching people jump to their death from the adjacent tower. One of Clark's co-workers screamed as she witnessed this and turned away, overwhelmed by the horrific sight. She sought comfort in Clark's arms. He took her to the women's restroom so she could regain her composure. Clark would later credit this act with saving his own life, because it took him away from the east side of his building. At 9:03 a.m., United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the south side of his tower, only a few floors below the spot on the trading floor where Clark had been standing only moments before.|$|E
40|$|Visibility {{limitations}} make cycling {{at night}} particularly dangerous. We previously reported cyclists’ {{perceptions of their}} own visibility at night and identified clothing configurations that made them feel visible. In this study we sought to determine whether these self-perceptions reflect actual visibility when wearing these clothing configurations. In a closed-road driving environment, cyclists wore black clothing, a fluorescent vest, a <b>reflective</b> <b>vest,</b> or a <b>reflective</b> <b>vest</b> plus ankle and knee reflectors. Drivers recognised more cyclists wearing the <b>reflective</b> <b>vest</b> plus reflectors (90 %) than the <b>reflective</b> <b>vest</b> alone (50 %), fluorescent vest (15 %) or black clothing (2 %). Older drivers recognised the cyclists less often than younger drivers (51 % vs 27 %). The findings suggest that reflective ankle and knee markings are particularly valuable at night, while fluorescent clothing is not. Cyclists wearing fluorescent clothing may be at particular risk if they incorrectly believe themselves to be conspicuous to drivers at night...|$|E

40|$|Motorcycle crash related {{injuries}} and deaths are increasing rapidly in many African nations. Utilizing conspicuity measures, such as wearing reflective, fluorescent safety vests, are effective as crash prevention strategies. Furthermore, use of some conspicuity measures is mandated by law among motorcycle-taxi drivers in Tanzania. Nonetheless, uptake remains low. Locally appropriate strategies to improve crash preventative behaviors are needed. To explore whether use of conspicuity measures {{could be improved}} through eliminating cost-barriers, we tested a distribution strategy involving the provision of free motorcycle safety vests among a population of motorcycle-taxi drivers in Moshi, Tanzania. We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial among 180 motorcycle-taxi drivers in which {{half of the participants}} (90) were randomized to the intervention arm and received a free <b>reflective</b> <b>vest.</b> The other half of the participants (90) were randomized to the control arm and did not receive free vests. Whether motorcycle taxi drivers used the <b>reflective</b> <b>vest</b> was then unobtrusively observed on city streets over a period of three months. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to estimate differential uptake of the vests between trial arms. At baseline, 3. 3 % of individuals in both arms used a <b>reflective</b> <b>vest.</b> In three months of follow-up, 79 drivers in the intervention arm and 82 drivers in the control arm were able to be observed. In the intervention arm the average proportion of observations during which drivers were observed to be using a <b>reflective</b> <b>vest</b> was 9. 5 %, compared to 2. 0 % in the control arm (odds ratio: 5. 5, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 1 - 26. 9, p-value: 0. 04). Distribution of free reflective vests did lead to an increase in vest usage, however, the increase was minimal.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a novel possible solution for people detection and estimation of their 3 D position in challenging shared environments. Addressing safety critical applications in industrial environments, {{we make the}} basic assumption that people wear reflective vests. In order to detect these vests and to discriminate them from other reflective material, we propose an approach based on a single camera equipped with an IR flash. The camera acquires pairs of images, one with and one without IR flash, in short succession. The images forming a pair are then {{related to each other}} through feature tracking, which allows to discard features for which the relative intensity difference is small and which are thus not believed to belong to a <b>reflective</b> <b>vest.</b> Next, the local neighbourhood of the remaining features is further analysed. First, a Random Forest classifier is used to discriminate between features caused by a <b>reflective</b> <b>vest</b> and features caused by some other reflective materials. Second, the distance between the camera and the vest features is estimated using a Random Forest regressor. The proposed system was evaluated in one indoor and two challenging outdoor scenarios. Our results indicate very good classification performance and remarkably accurate distance estimation especially in combination with the SURF descriptor, even under direct exposure to sunlight. ...|$|E

This work was conceived as a balance between modeling the complex phenomena within the human visual system {{and the need for}} a simple applications-oriented tool for practitioners to derive a quantitative relative assessment of real world construction work zones in order to rank choices in terms of conspicuity. The results indicate that our vision model-based tool can assess the relative conspicuity of individual elements of a roadway or roadside scene and is relatively straightforward in use. As such, it holds potential value in engaging in “virtual ” prototyping of work zone sight lines, colors, and placement of hazard warning cues such as cones, markings and <b>reflective</b> <b>vests...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose To {{quantify}} {{the effects of}} driver age on night-time pedestrian conspicuity, and to determine whether individual differences in visual performance can predict drivers' ability to recognise pedestrians at night. Methods Participants were 32 visually normal drivers (20 younger: M = 24. 4 years ± 6. 4 years; 12 older: M = 72. 0 years ± 5. 0 years). Visual performance was measured in a laboratory-based testing session including visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, motion sensitivity and the useful field of view. Night-time pedestrian recognition distances were recorded while participants drove an instrumented vehicle along a closed road course at night; to increase the workload of drivers, auditory and visual distracter tasks were presented {{for some of the}} laps. Pedestrians walked in place, sideways to the oncoming vehicles, and wore either a standard high visibility <b>reflective</b> <b>vest</b> or reflective tape positioned on the movable joints (biological motion). Results Driver age and pedestrian clothing significantly (p < 0. 05) affected the distance at which the drivers first responded to the pedestrians. Older drivers recognised pedestrians at approximately half the distance of the younger drivers and pedestrians were recognised more often and at longer distances when they wore a biological motion reflective clothing configuration than when they wore a <b>reflective</b> <b>vest.</b> Motion sensitivity was an independent predictor of pedestrian recognition distance, even when controlling for driver age. Conclusions The night-time pedestrian recognition capacity of older drivers was significantly worse than that of younger drivers. The distance at which drivers first recognised pedestrians at night was best predicted by a test of motion sensitivity...|$|E

40|$|Safety {{concerns}} are {{a natural part}} of many outdoor human experiences, across many jobs and industries including construction, mining, and emergency services, as well as many day-to-day activities such as biking, hiking, and running.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} moderate levels of refractive blur and simulated cataracts on nighttime pedestrian conspicuity in the presence and absence of headlamp glare. Methods: The ability to recognize pedestrians at night was measured in 28 young adults (M= 27. 6 years) under three visual conditions: normal vision, refractive blur and simulated cataracts; mean acuity was 20 / 40 or better in all conditions. Pedestrian recognition distances were recorded while participants drove an instrumented vehicle along a closed road course at night. Pedestrians wore one of three clothing conditions and oncoming headlamps were present for 16 participants and absent for 12 participants. Results: Simulated visual impairment and glare significantly reduced the frequency with which drivers recognized pedestrians and the distance at which the drivers first recognized them. Simulated cataracts were significantly more disruptive than blur even though photopic visual acuity levels were matched. With normal vision, drivers responded to pedestrians at 3. 6 x and 5. 5 x longer distances on average than for the blur or cataract conditions, respectively. Even in the presence of visual impairment and glare, pedestrians were recognized more often and at longer distances when they wore a “biological motion” reflective clothing configuration than when they wore a <b>reflective</b> <b>vest</b> or black clothing. Conclusions: Drivers’ ability to recognize pedestrians at night is degraded by common visual impairments even when the drivers’ mean visual acuity meets licensing requirements. To maximize drivers’ ability to see pedestrians, drivers should wear their optimum optical correction, and cataract surgery should be performed early enough to avoid potentially dangerous reductions in visual performance...|$|E

40|$|Bicycling {{at night}} is more {{dangerous}} than in the daytime and poor conspicuity {{is likely to be}} a contributing factor. The use of reflective markings on a pedestrian’s major joints to facilitate the perception of biological motion has been shown to greatly enhance pedestrian conspicuity at night, but few corresponding data exist for bicyclists. Twelve younger and twelve older participants drove around a closed-road circuit at night and indicated when they first saw a bicyclist who wore black clothing either alone, or together with a <b>reflective</b> bicycling <b>vest,</b> or a vest plus ankle and knee reflectors. The bicyclist pedaled in place on a bicycle that had either a static or flashing light, or no light on the handlebars. Bicyclist clothing significantly affected conspicuity; drivers responded to bicyclists wearing the vest plus ankle and knee reflectors at significantly longer distances than when the bicyclist wore the vest alone or black clothing without a vest. Older drivers responded to bicyclists less often and at shorter distances than younger drivers. The presence of a bicycle light, whether static or flashing, did not enhance the conspicuity of the bicyclist; this may result in bicyclists who use a bicycle light being overconfident of their own conspicuity at night. The implications of our findings are that ankle and knee markings are a simple and very effective approach for enhancing bicyclist conspicuity at night...|$|R
