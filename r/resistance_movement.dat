5|$|A <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> soon emerged. On 22 June 1941, the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment {{was formed}} near Sisak, {{as the first}} {{military}} unit formed by a <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> in occupied Europe. This sparked {{the beginning of the}} Yugoslav Partisan movement, a communist multi-ethnic anti-fascist resistance group led by Josip Broz Tito. The movement grew rapidly and at the Tehran Conference in December 1943 the Partisans gained recognition from the Allies.|$|E

5|$|A <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> {{developed}} in Belgium {{soon after the}} German occupation. The resistance took various forms. Although some sabotages by the resistance, notably {{the destruction of the}} Brussels-Aachen railway line, were celebrated at the time, armed resistance represented a minority of their acts. Around 300 separate resistance networks existed which often included both male and female members.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>resistance</b> <b>movements</b> {{were created}} {{as early as}} in late 1939 in {{occupied}} Poland. As the war progressed {{and the number of}} Nazi-occupied territories grew, so did the number and strength of <b>resistance</b> <b>movements.</b>|$|R

5|$|After the Khmer Rouge {{regime was}} overthrown, a new Cambodian {{government}} supported by Vietnam, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), was established. The Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, {{was unhappy with}} Vietnam's influence over the PRK government. Deng proposed to Sihanouk that he co-operate with the Khmer Rouge to overthrow the PRK government, but rejected it, as he opposed the genocidal policies pursued by the Khmer Rouge {{while they were in}} power. In March 1981 Sihanouk established a <b>resistance</b> <b>movement,</b> FUNCINPEC which was complemented by a small resistance army known as Armée Nationale Sihanoukiste (ANS). He appointed In Tam, who had briefly served as Prime Minister in the Khmer Republic, as the commander-in-chief of ANS. The ANS needed military aid from China, and Deng seized the opportunity to sway Sihanouk into collaborating with the Khmer Rouge. Sihanouk reluctantly agreed, and started talks in March 1981 with the Khmer Rouge and the Son Sann-led Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) on a unified anti-PRK <b>resistance</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E

5|$|Crass were an English art {{collective}} and punk rock band formed in 1977 who promoted anarchism {{as a political}} ideology, {{a way of life}} and a <b>resistance</b> <b>movement.</b> Crass popularised the anarcho-punk movement of the punk subculture, advocating direct action, animal rights, feminism and environmentalism. The band used and advocated a DIY punk ethic approach to its sound collages, leaflets, albums and films.|$|E

5|$|A French {{military}} flying column then marched toward Antananarivo, losing {{many men}} to malaria and other diseases. Reinforcements came from Algeria and Sub-Saharan Africa. Upon reaching {{the city in}} September 1895, the column bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, causing heavy casualties and leading Queen Ranavalona III to surrender. France annexed Madagascar in 1896 and declared the island a colony the following year, dissolving the Merina monarchy and sending the royal family into exile on Réunion Island and to Algeria. A two-year <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> organized {{in response to the}} French capture of the royal palace was effectively put {{down at the end of}} 1897.|$|E

5|$|An Indian <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> against U.S. {{expansion}} {{had been}} growing through {{the leadership of the}} Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). The conflict became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes that they would be protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the white settlers. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey, which was becoming known as evil for American Indians.|$|E

Sarah's future son John will rally the survivors and lead a <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> against Skynet and its army of machines. With the Resistance on the verge of victory, Skynet sent a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John is born, to prevent the formation of the Resistance. The Terminator is an efficient killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton and an external layer of living tissue that makes it appear human.|$|E

The troupe fled Shanghai before it fell to the Japanese, traveling and performing for the next three years under harsh conditions through central and southwest China.|$|E

Eliezer is {{transferred}} to the children's block where he stays with 600 others, dreaming of soup. On 5 April 1945 the inmates are told the camp is to be liquidated and {{they are to be}} moved—another death march. On 11 April, with 20,000 inmates still inside, a <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> inside the camp attacks the remaining SS officers and takes control. At six o'clock that evening, an American tank arrives at the gates, and behind it the Sixth Armored Division of the United States Third Army.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War Lysaker Station {{was hit by}} five {{sabotage}} missions by the Norwegian <b>resistance</b> <b>movement,</b> {{in which}} tanks of gasoline, attached or not attached to railroad cars, were blown up. The sabotages took place on 16 December 1944 and 9, 10, 12 and 13 January 1945. On 13 January a tanker truck was attacked as well. There were three additional attacks on Lysaker in 1944 and 1945, two of them against factories and workshops. Also, the Lysaker Bridge sabotage {{took place in the}} immediate vicinity of the station.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} and fall of 1941, in {{reprisal}} for guerrilla attacks, the Germans carried out several massacres of Belgrade citizens; in particular, members of the Jewish community were subject to mass shootings at the order of General Franz Böhme, the German Military Governor of Serbia. Böhme rigorously enforced the rule that for every German killed, 100 Serbs or Jews would be shot. The <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> in Belgrade was led by Major Žarko Todorović from 1941 until his arrest in 1943.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{conflict}} in Gaza {{between the state}} of Israel and Palestinians led by Hamas has again brought the question of Palestinian statehood {{to the attention of}} the international community. Religion has often been mentioned as a cause for the conflict between the two, as well as a reason for the perceived instability of the Middle East. It is within this frame of reference that this study takes place. This study attempts to use this emergence in current events as the starting point for the interaction between religion and <b>resistance</b> <b>movements,</b> examining the incorporation of Islamic doctrine into the actions towards Israel of the <b>resistance</b> <b>movements</b> Hamas and Hezbollah. In an attempt to determine the incorporation of Islam into <b>resistance</b> <b>movements,</b> this study will undertake case studies on two leading Islamic <b>resistance</b> <b>movements,</b> Hamas and Hezbollah. The Islamic doctrine to be investigated in these studies is that of the Umma, the worldwide community of Muslim believers. These case studies will examine how the doctrine of umma affects the two <b>resistance</b> <b>movements,</b> as well as variations in its interpretation in the two movements. This will allow for both an understanding of religious influence in <b>resistance</b> <b>movements,</b> but will also examine the differentiation of understanding of doctrine in Islam, as Hamas is primarily a Sunni organization, while Hezbollah is primarily Shiite. In this, a greater understanding of each of these concepts and their interaction will be gained...|$|R

5|$|During {{this time}} the Jewish <b>Resistance</b> <b>Movement</b> was formed, {{comprising}} several pre-existing Jewish groups. In 1921, the part-time Haganah was formed and trained as a national army. Most Jewish males and some females were required to join. After the Second World War, it obtained numerous surplus weapons to equip its members. The Haganah gave priority to increasing the Jewish population by bringing immigrants into the country from Europe. It always attempted to give prior notice of an attack so that any security service personnel in the area could be evacuated.|$|E
5|$|Following Italy's September 1911 {{invasion}} of Libya, al-Qassam began collecting funds in Jableh {{for the joint}} Ottoman-Libyan <b>resistance</b> <b>movement</b> and composed a victory anthem. Jableh's district governor sought to gain control over the fundraiser and when locals nevertheless continued to send their donations to al-Qassam, he attempted to have him jailed. The district governor alleged that al-Qassam was working against the Ottoman state, but an official investigation found him not guilty and the governor was consequently dismissed.|$|E
