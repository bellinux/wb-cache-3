An expert from [...] Gandhinagar as well as a team of experts from CFSL concluded that the drag mark on the roof resulted from a blood-soaked body being dragged after being kept in a bed sheet. This raised suspicion that Hemraj might have been killed somewhere else, and his body dragged to the terrace in order to hide it. However, in June 2008, CBI's UV Light testing team reported that it didn't find Hemraj's bloodstains anywhere except the terrace. So, unless the killer cleaned up the original murder spot, Hemraj seems to have been killed on the terrace. The blood found on the staircase leading to the terrace on 17 May might have come from the mattress that the cleaners were trying to dump on the terrace.|$|E
40|$|Reflective roof {{coatings}} {{keep the}} <b>roof</b> <b>cooler</b> by minimizing solar absorption and maximizing thermal emission. Keeping {{the surface of}} the <b>roof</b> <b>cooler</b> allows less heat to be conducted into the interior of the building which reduces the cooling load in air-conditioned buildings and improve comfort conditions in non-air conditioned buildings. A number of cool white materials, compatible with most roofing products, are available on the market. To appeal to homeowners, special cool “color” products have been developed to match the dark colors of conventional residential roofs but are highly reflective in the invisible near-infrared (NIR) spectrum. Although many studies highlight the benefits of cool white coatings on roof membranes of low-slope roofs, knowledge of NIR reflective coatings on asphalt shingles of steep slope roofs remains limited. The intent of this exploratory study is to present a process {{that can be used to}} evaluate the perceived and actual benefits of NIR coatings field-applied to asphalt shingles on single-family houses. The proposed process can be applied to a large sample of homes and occupants in a future study. A questionnaire was designed to attempt to evaluate occupants’ perceived benefits in regards to their indoor environment and occupant satisfaction following applications of NIR coatings. Along with subjective data collection, a field-experiment was developed to objectively compare the thermal performance of an NIR reflective field-coated asphalt shingle roof system with that of a conventional asphalt shingle roof system. Questionnaire results indicated that occupants did not perceive any significant changes to their indoor environment but were satisfied overall with the application and appearance of the roof coating. Additionally, 50 % of occupants stated that their monthly energy costs somewhat decreased after the application. Interestingly, 63 % of respondents experienced some form of roof leak following the coating application. Among those who experienced roof leaks, 100 % of the roofs were 10 years or older. Field results showed that the coated roof surface was 2 to 5 ℉ cooler than the uncoated roof surface at midafternoon. Statistical testing for correlation between coated roof surface temperature and external conditions revealed that relative humidity was negatively correlated with coated roof temperature, while solar altitude angle was positively correlated with coated roof temperature. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to develop a model for predicting the surface temperature of the coated asphalt shingle roofs from the ambient temperature, sky conditions, dew point temperature, relative humidity, solar altitude and azimuth angle.

40|$|Flywheel Cooling" utillzes {{the natural}} cooling {{processes}} of evaporation, ventilation and air circulation. These systems are providing low-cost cooling for distribution centers, warehouses, and other non air-conditioned industrial assembly plants {{with little or}} no internal loads. The evaporative roof cooling system keeps the building from heating up during the day by misting the roof surface with a fine spray of water -just enough to evaporate. This process keeps the roof surface at 90 ? levels instead of 150 ? and knocks out the radiant heat transfer from the roof into the building. The system is controlled by a thermostat and automatically shuts off at night or when the roof surface cools below the set point. The same control system turns on exhaust fans to load the building with cool night air. Air circulators are installed to provide air movement on workers during the day. Best results are achieved by closing dock doors and minimizing hot air infiltration during the day. The typical application will maintain inside temperatures that will average 84 ? - 86 ? when outside ambient temperatures range from 98 ?- 100 ?. Many satisfied users will attest to marked improvements in employee moral and productivity, along with providing safe storage temperatures for many products.

40|$|Problem: Roofs {{receive the}} most intense solar heat load among all {{building}} envelope surfaces in Equatorial-region. Solar heat gain through roof contributes to {{a significant portion of}} building heat load. In tropics where building cooling is needed all-year-round, passive methods to reduce heat gain through roof could provide significant cooling energy-savings. Approach: Currently, the most widely adopted practices to curb the heat flux through roof include using thick building material-layer (30 - 40 cm-thick concrete) or insulation (5 - 10 cm-thick). This study investigates the thermal performance of emerging methods: <b>cool</b> <b>roof</b> and green <b>roof.</b> <b>Cool</b> <b>roof</b> works by applying a coating-layer having high-solar-albedo. Green roof works by adding a soil-layer and vegetation.
