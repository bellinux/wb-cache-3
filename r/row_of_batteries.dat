Attacking by land was {{impossible}} and so d’Arçon began designing [...] "unsinkable and fire-proof batteries" [...] intended to breakthrough from the coast in tandem with other batteries advancing the British rear from inland. These would have strong thick wooden armour and water pumped around them to avoid fire breaking out, whilst old cables would also deaden the fall of enemy shot and their ballast would counterbalance the guns' weight. They would also be supported by ships {{of the line and}} bomb ships, who would try to draw away and split up the enemy fire.

40|$|Agriculture {{accounts}} for 10 to 12 % of the World’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Manure management alone {{is responsible for}} 13 % of GHG emissions from the agricultural sector. During the last decade, Québec’s egg production systems have shifted from deep-pit housing systems to manure belt housing systems. The objective {{of this study was}} to measure and compare carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from three different cage layer housing systems: a deep liquid manure pit and a manure belt with natural or forced air drying. Deep liquid manure pit housing systems consist of “A” frame layer cages located over a closed pit containing the hens’ droppings to which water is added to facilitate removal by pumping. Manure belt techniques imply that manure drops on a belt beneath each <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>battery</b> cages where it is either dried naturally or by forced air until it is removed. The experiment was replicated with 360 hens reared into twelve independent bench-scale rooms during eight weeks (19 – 27 weeks of age). The natural and forced air manure belt systems reduced CO 2 (28. 2 and 28. 7 kg yr− 1 hen− 1, respectively), CH 4 (25. 3 and 27. 7 g yr− 1 hen− 1, respectively) and N 2 O (2. 60 and 2. 48 g yr− 1 hen− 1, respectively) emissions by about 21, 16 and 9 % in comparison with the deep-pit technique (36. 0 kg CO 2 yr− 1 hen− 1, 31. 6 g CH 4 yr− 1 hen− 1 and 2. 78 g N 2 O yr− 1 hen− 1). The shift to manure belt systems needs to be encouraged since this housing system significantly decreases the production of GHG...|$|R

His magnificent bearing was contributory in a large measure to the success of a most difficult and hard fought action. As the tanks reached the crest of the rise they were met by extremely intense fire from a large number of guns of all descriptions: the fire was so heavy that it was doubtful for a moment whether the Brigade could maintain its hold on the position.The tanks having slowed to [...] "hull-down" [...] positions, settled to beat down the enemy fire, during which time Captain Jackman rapidly pushed up the ridge leading his Machine Gun trucks and saw at once that Anti-Tank Guns were firing at the flank of the tanks, as well as the <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>batteries</b> which the tanks were engaging on their front.He immediately started to get his guns into action as calmly as though he were on manoeuvres and so secured the right flank. Then, standing up in the front of his truck, with calm determination he led his trucks across the front between the tanks and the uns—there was no other road to get them into action on the left flank.Most of the tank commanders saw him, and his exemplary devotion to duty regardless of danger not only inspired his own men but clinched the determination of the tank crews never to relinquish the position which they had gained.Throughout he coolly directed the guns to their positions and indicated targets to them and at that time seemed to bear a charmed life but later he was killed while still inspiring everyone with the greatest confidence by his bearing.|$|R

40|$|Box of Energy is {{a company}} in Gothenburg who offers battery storage in {{connection}} to both solar energy and wind energy and direct connection to the electric grid. They are working to raise the output power that their battery storage can deliver. One way to solve that {{is to find a}} new inverter. The company have also received a project to calculate how much battery storage is needed for a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> garages in a residential area where plug-in hybrid and electric cars will be charging. The purpose of this essay has been to find a new inverter for Box of Energy. This, so the company would be able to increase the output power <b>of</b> their <b>battery</b> storage. A market research was made by going to different inverter manufactures homepages and go through their datasheets for the inverters they offered. The project then went on to compare different providers <b>of</b> <b>battery</b> storages on the market. This was also done by visiting their homepages and going through datasheets. Then, lastly, calculation of the charging power for hybrid and electrical cars in a residential area was carried out. The area consisted of 150 houses and <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> garages with 16 garages on each <b>row.</b> The charging <b>of</b> the cars is assumed to happen simultaneously and that leads to very high load on the electric grid. By installing battery storage between the electric grid and the cars the load will be lower. Through the market research it was established that there is a big range of different inverters. They vary in both capacity and physical size. The inverter that was considered the most interesting one was SG 10 KTL-EC and is delivered by Sungrow power. When it comes to the residential area it could be established that the amount <b>of</b> <b>battery</b> storage was linked to the charging power that the cars demanded. If the garages only contained electric cars and not plug-in hybrids the load would be the highest and demand the biggest amount <b>of</b> <b>battery</b> storage units. At the same time, it could be established that the effect of not using any battery storage would lead to the need of changing the fuse since the original one would be too low. It would also be needed to install new cables. Should, on the other hand, a currently theoretical software be implemented that can distribute the charging of the cars evenly during the night, the load becomes significantly smaller and then battery storage would not be a necessary solution...|$|R
