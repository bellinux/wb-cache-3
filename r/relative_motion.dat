5|$|Near Cape Mendocino, the Mendocino Triple Junction {{is an area}} {{of active}} {{seismicity}} where three tectonic plates come together. The Mendocino Fracture Zone (also known as the Mendocino Fault east of the Gorda Ridge) is a transform fault that separates the Pacific and Gorda Plates. To the south, the <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> between the Pacific Plate and North American Plate is accommodated by the San Andreas Fault, and to the north, the Gorda Plate is converging with the North American Plate at the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Earthquakes within the Gorda Plate are the result of north-south compression at the Mendocino Fault.|$|E
5|$|The BTO {{analysis}} {{was able to}} determine {{the distance between the}} satellite and aircraft with a relatively high degree of accuracy, while the BFO {{analysis was}} able to estimate the heading and speed of the aircraft, but is sensitive to small changes in input data. To determine the final location of Flight 370, the BTO and BFO analyses were considered in combination with aircraft performance limitations, such as altitude, airspeed, and wind. The BFO analysis was able to isolate the Doppler shift between the aircraft and determine the <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> of the aircraft to the satellite, which is reduced by the limited range of speeds at which the aircraft can fly and thus a limited set of speed/direction combinations exist that correlate with the calculated Doppler shifts.|$|E
40|$|Mapping in the GPS-denied {{environment}} {{is an important}} and challenging task {{in the field of}} robotics. In the large environment, mapping can be significantly accelerated by multiple robots exploring different parts of the environment. Accordingly, a key problem is how to integrate these local maps built by different robots into a single global map. In this paper, we propose an approach for simultaneous merging of multiple grid maps by the robust motion averaging. The main idea of this approach is to recover all global motions for map merging from a set of <b>relative</b> <b>motions.</b> Therefore, it firstly adopts the pair-wise map merging method to estimate <b>relative</b> <b>motions</b> for grid map pairs. To obtain as many reliable <b>relative</b> <b>motions</b> as possible, a graph-based sampling scheme is utilized to efficiently remove unreliable <b>relative</b> <b>motions</b> obtained from the pair-wise map merging. Subsequently, the accurate global motions can be recovered from the set of reliable <b>relative</b> <b>motions</b> by the motion averaging. Experimental results carried on real robot data sets demonstrate that proposed approach can achieve simultaneous merging of multiple grid maps with good performances...|$|R

5|$|Sierra {{wanted the}} game to have Hollywood-quality film sequences, so they sought a {{director}} with experience in the film industry. They hired Peter Maris, whose previous experience was mainly of action and drama films, although some of his earlier films were graphic horror movies. Maris and Roberta Williams collaborated {{a great deal from}} the beginning of the process, with Maris explaining what he wanted in each scene from a filmmaker's perspective, and Williams explaining her desires from a game designer's perspective. Maris set up the camera angles and worked with the actors, using three motion-controlled cameras during the shooting. All filming was done entirely in front of a blue screen, and the digitized information was later loaded into the Silicon Graphics computers, which synchronized the <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> of computer-generated, three-dimensional background art. Next, the live action and the backgrounds were composited using advanced techniques controlled by Petro VLahos's UltiMatte system. The computer imaging components made Phantasmagoria a very different experience for Maris than his usual film industry work. Crow served as a production coordinator during filming, helping facilitate what happened on stage. He also directed the scenes that involved stunts or other special effects that required the coordination of animated sequences with live action. Cindy Jordan worked as the makeup artist.|$|E
5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E
5|$|While the BTO {{is able to}} {{determine}} {{the distance between the}} satellite and the aircraft at the time of each handshake, it was still necessary {{to determine}} where along the BTO arcs the aircraft was. To accomplish this, an analysis was performed on another attribute of received signals that was recorded by the ground station: the burst frequency offset (BFO)—the difference between the expected and actual frequencies of the signal received from the aircraft. The BFO is primarily caused by the Doppler shift—a shift in frequency caused by the relative movement of the aircraft, satellite, and ground station—along with several other factors which can be calculated and removed, allowing the Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite to be isolated. The Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite indicates the <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> of the aircraft relative to the satellite, although multiple combinations of aircraft speed and heading exist that match a given Doppler shift value.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{averaging}} {{of multiple}} pairwise <b>relative</b> <b>motions</b> {{in a sequence}} provides a fast and accurate method of camera motion estimation {{with a wide range}} of applications, including view registration, robotic path estimation, superresolution. Since this approach involves averaging in the Lie-algebra of the underlying motion representation, it is non-robust and susceptible to contamination due to outliers in the individual <b>relative</b> <b>motions.</b> In this paper, we introduce a graphbased sampling scheme that efficiently remove such motion outliers. The resulting global motion solution is robust and also provides an empirical estimate of the inherent statistical uncertainty. Example results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach to incorporating robustness in motion averaging. ...|$|R

It {{is well known}} (since Michael Faraday's work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> occurs {{in a direction that}} the conductor cuts across (or is cut by), rather than along, the lines of the magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor. The strength of the current depends on a) the rate of <b>relative</b> <b>motion,</b> b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the direction of flow is dependent upon the direction of <b>relative</b> <b>motion.</b> Dynamos make use of this basic process ("the dynamo effect"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of offshore loading and discharge are the <b>relative</b> horizontal <b>motions</b> between the HTV and its cargo which must be controlled, to ensure safe and reliable operations. Optimization of the cargo handling system is needed to control the <b>relative</b> horizontal <b>motions.</b> This study investigates whether the mooring device ShoreTension will minimize the <b>relative</b> horizontal <b>motions</b> between a HTV and a cargo, when it is used as the cargo handling system during offshore loading and discharge operations. A MATLAB function of ShoreTension is developed, which is implemented into AQWA to predict the <b>relative</b> horizontal <b>motions</b> between the HTV and the cargo in time. Multiple simulations have been performed, {{each with its own}} cargo handling system. A simplified MATLAB mass-spring-ShoreTension model resembling the HTV and the cargo is set up to determine why and when ShoreTension reduces motions. A cargo handling system including ShoreTension cannot reduce the high-, wave-frequent <b>relative</b> horizontal <b>motions</b> occurring between the HTV and the cargo, as they are induced by an excitation frequency far beyond the natural frequency of the original system. Furthermore, a cargo handling system including ShoreTension should be able to lower the low-frequent <b>relative</b> horizontal <b>motions,</b> which are the result of resonance; by increasing the stiffness and by adding damping through giving out and heaving in the mooring line. The optimal configuration has not yet been found. It is recommended to further investigate in how ShoreTension should be outfitted as cargo handling system such that the low-frequent <b>relative</b> horizontal <b>motions</b> are minimized.
