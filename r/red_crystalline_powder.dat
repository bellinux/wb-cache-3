50|$|Methyl red (2-(N,N-dimethyl-4-aminophenyl) azobenzenecarboxylic acid), {{also called}} C.I. Acid Red 2, is an {{indicator}} dye that turns red in acidic solutions. It is an azo dye, {{and is a}} dark <b>red</b> <b>crystalline</b> <b>powder.</b> Methyl red is a pH indicator; it is red in pH under 4.4, yellow in pH over 6.2, and orange in between, with a pKa of 5.1. Murexide and methyl red are investigated as promising enhancers of sonochemical destruction of chlorinated hydrocarbon pollutants. Methyl red is classed by the IARC in group 3 - unclassified as to carcinogenic potential in humans.|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} clay minerals—montmorillonite and {{vermiculite}} {{have been chosen}} as a host matrix for the intercalation of methyl red (MR) in order to investigate a possible fluorescence tuning via dye-clay interactions. The effect of silicate layer charge on the structure and fluorescence of dye-clay intercalated hybrid nanostructures was investigated using combination of molecular modeling with experiment. Structure of both intercalates MR-vermiculite (MR-VER) and MR-montmorillonite (MR-MMT) exhibits high degree of structural disorder resulting in broaden emission band. The fluorescence wavelength range of MR intercalated in clays is shifted to lower wavelengths compared with the pristine MR polycrystalline sample (800 nm). Results showed the strong dependence of fluorescence band maximum on the silicate layer charge, λmax = 565 nm for MR-MMT, 645 nm for MR-VER and 800 nm for the methyl <b>red</b> fine <b>crystalline</b> <b>powder,</b> whereas the structural disorder in the arrangement of dye molecules affects the emission band broadening...|$|R
