These block and <b>random</b> <b>copolymers</b> {{were designed to}} have similar molecular weights and comonomer ratios; both types of copolymers showed thermosensitivity in aqueous solutions with similar cloud points. The copolymers self-assembled into micelles in water as shown by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron micros-copy. The hydrodynamic diameter of the micelles formed by the block copolymer is much larger and exhibited a broad and gradual shrinkage from 20 to 54 Â°C below its cloud point, while the micelles formed by the <b>random</b> <b>copolymers</b> are smaller in size but exhibited some swelling in the same temperature range.

50|$|PBAT, is a <b>random</b> <b>copolymer</b> that {{is known}} for being {{flexible}} and tough.

50|$|Polymerization of {{tetrafluoroethylene}} produces polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) polymers such as Teflon and Fluon. PTFE {{is one of}} the two {{fluorocarbon resins}} composed wholly of fluorine and carbon. The other resin composed purely of carbon and fluorine is the copolymer of TFE with typically 6-9% hexafluoropropene (HFP), which is known as FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymer). TFE is also used in the preparation of numerous copolymers that also include hydrogen and/or oxygen, including both fluoroplastics and fluoroelastomers. Typical TFE-based fluoroplastics include ETFE, the alternating 1:1 copolymer with ethylene, and PFA, which is a <b>random</b> <b>copolymer</b> similar to FEP but with a minor amount of a perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether (PAVE) rather than HFP.

By addition of an interfacial agent, the morphology of the immiscible blend can be changed and the adhesion between the phases can be improved, good phase dispersion and uniform particle size can be achieved. One of the promising routes to compatibilize an immiscible polymer blend is by using a <b>random</b> <b>copolymer.</b> Random copolymers are relatively easy to synthesize and do not form micelles. There are many experimental and theoretical results that support this possibility. In a recent study, Kramer and co-workers studied {{the use of a}} <b>random</b> <b>copolymer</b> of poly(styrene-co- 2 -vinylpyridine) to reinforce the joint between polystyrene (PS) and poly(2 -vinylpyridine).

5000|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{synthesize}} <b>random</b> <b>copolymers.</b> The most common synthesis method is free radical polymerization; this is especially useful when the desired properties rely on the composition of the copolymer rather than the molecular weight, since free radical polymerization produces relatively disperse polymer chains. Free radical polymerization is less expensive than other methods, and produces high-molecular weight polymer quickly. [...] Several methods offer better control over dispersity. Anionic polymerization can be used to create <b>random</b> <b>copolymers,</b> but with several caveats: if carbanions of the two components {{do not have the same}} stability, only one of the species will add to the other. Additionally, anionic polymerization is expensive and requires very clean reaction conditions, and is therefore difficult to implement on a large scale. Monodisperse <b>random</b> <b>copolymers</b> are also synthesized by â³livingâ³ controlled radical polymerization methods, such as atom-transfer radical-polymerization (ATRP), nitroxide mediated radical polymerization (NMP), or Reversible additionâfragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (RAFT).

The reactions require longer experimentation periods than free radical polymerization, but still achieve reasonable reaction rates.|$|R
