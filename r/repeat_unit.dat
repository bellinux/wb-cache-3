25|$|Poly(styrene), for example, is {{composed}} only of styrene monomer residues, {{and is therefore}} classified as a homopolymer. Ethylene-vinyl acetate, on the other hand, contains more than one variety of <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> and is thus a copolymer. Some biological polymers are composed {{of a variety of}} different but structurally related monomer residues; for example, polynucleotides such as DNA are composed of four types of nucleotide subunits.|$|E
25|$|Alternating {{copolymers}} possess two regularly alternating monomer residues: n (structure 2 at right). An {{example is}} the equimolar copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride formed by free-radical chain-growth polymerization. A step-growth copolymer such as Nylon 66 {{can also be considered}} a strictly alternating copolymer of diamine and diacid residues, but is often described as a homopolymer with the dimeric residue of one amine and one acid as a <b>repeat</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{polymers}} {{are usually}} consist of one <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> or several <b>repeating</b> <b>units,</b> arranged in random sequences. Sequence-controlled polymers {{are composed of}} different <b>repeating</b> <b>units,</b> which are arranged in an ordered manner. In order to control the sequence, various kinds of synthetic methodologies are developed.|$|R
50|$|For {{polymers}} in condensed chemical formulas, parentheses {{are placed}} around the <b>repeating</b> <b>unit.</b> For example, a hydrocarbon molecule that {{is described as}} CH3(CH2)50CH3, is a molecule with fifty <b>repeating</b> <b>units.</b> If the number of <b>repeating</b> <b>units</b> is unknown or variable, the letter n {{may be used to}} indicate this formula: CH3(CH2)nCH3.|$|R

25|$|A {{microsatellite}} is a {{tract of}} repetitive DNA in which certain DNA motifs (ranging in length from 1–6 or more base pairs) are repeated, typically 5–50 times. Microsatellites occur at thousands of locations within an organism's genome. They {{have a higher}} mutation rate than other areas of DNA DNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for reading DNA during replication, can slip while moving along the template strand and continue at the wrong nucleotide. DNA polymerase slippage {{is more likely to}} occur when a repetitive sequence (such as CGCGCG) is replicated. Because microsatellites consist of such repetitive sequences, DNA polymerase may make errors at a higher rate in these sequence regions. Several studies have found evidence that slippage is the cause of microsatellite mutations. Typically, slippage in each microsatellite occurs about once per 1,000 generations. Thus, slippage changes in repetitive DNA are three orders of magnitude more common than point mutations {{in other parts of the}} genome. Most slippage results in a change of just one <b>repeat</b> <b>unit,</b> and slippage rates vary for different allele lengths and <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> sizes, and within different species. If there is a large size difference between individual alleles, then there may be increased instability during recombination at meiosis.|$|E
25|$|Polymerization is {{the process}} of {{combining}} many small molecules known as monomers into a covalently bonded chain or network. During the polymerization process, some chemical groups may be lost from each monomer. This is the case, for example, in the polymerization of PET polyester. The monomers are terephthalic acid (HOOC-C6H4-COOH) and ethylene glycol (HO-CH2- CH2-OH) but the repeating unit is -OC-C6H4-COO-CH2-CH2-O-, which corresponds to the combination of the two monomers with the loss of two water molecules. The distinct piece of each monomer that is incorporated into the polymer is known as a <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> or monomer residue.|$|E
25|$|The {{antifouling}} {{characteristics of}} PEG are well documented, but the service life of PEG antifouling coatings is debated {{due to the}} hydrolysis of PEG chains in air, {{as well as by}} the low concentrations of transition metal ions present in seawater. Using DOPA residues as attachment points, new polymers similar in structure to the polypeptide backbone of proteins are being investigated, such as peptidomimetic polymer (PMP1). PMP1 uses a <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> of N-substituted glycine instead of ethylene glycol to impart antifouling properties. The N-substituted glycine is structurally similar to ethylene glycol and is hydrophilic, so easily dissolves in water. In controlled studies, PMP1-coated titanium surfaces were seen to be resistant to biofouling over a period of 180 days, even with continued addition and exposure to microfouling organisms.|$|E
40|$|The <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> of cepacian, the {{exopolysaccharide}} {{produced by}} the majority of the Burkholderia cepacia complex microorganisms, was isolated from inner bacterial membranes and investigated by mass spectrometry. The data obtained led to the determination of its structure, thus disclosing the oligosaccharidic sequence synthesised by bacteria, and gave also information on the biosynthetic pathway of cepacian <b>repeating</b> <b>unit,</b> thanks to the presence of saccharidic intermediates shorter than the <b>repeating</b> <b>unit.</b> In addition, from zero to four acetyl substituents were detected on the <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> before the polymerisation process which takes place in the periplasmic space. The procedure used can be conveniently exploited as an alternative route to the structural determination of bacteria exopolysaccharides, particularly useful for complex <b>repeating</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{chemical}} structure of UF polymer consists of (O)CNCH2n <b>repeat</b> <b>units.</b> In contrast melanine-formaldehyde resins feature NCH2OCH2N <b>repeat</b> <b>units.</b> Depending on the polymerization conditions, some branching can occur.

500|$|They {{are widely}} used to prevent the {{oxidative}} degradation of polymers such as rubbers, plastics and adhesives that causes a loss of strength and flexibility in these materials. Polymers containing double bonds in their main chains, such as natural rubber and polybutadiene, are especially susceptible to oxidation and ozonolysis. They can be protected by antiozonants. Solid polymer products start to crack on exposed surfaces as the material degrades and the chains break. The mode of cracking varies between oxygen and ozone attack, the former causing a [...] "crazy paving" [...] effect, while ozone attack produces deeper cracks aligned {{at right angles to}} the tensile strain in the product. [...] Oxidation and UV degradation are also frequently linked, mainly because UV radiation creates free radicals by bond breakage. The free radicals then react with oxygen to produce peroxy radicals which cause yet further damage, often in a chain reaction. Other polymers susceptible to oxidation include polypropylene and polyethylene. The former is more sensitive owing to the presence of secondary carbon atoms present in every <b>repeat</b> <b>unit.</b> Attack occurs at this point because the free radical formed is more stable than one formed on a primary carbon atom. Oxidation of polyethylene tends to occur at weak links in the chain, such as branch points in low-density polyethylene.|$|E
2500|$|The {{identity}} of the repeat units (monomer residues, also known as [...] "mers") comprising a polymer is its {{first and most important}} attribute. Polymer nomenclature is generally based upon the type of monomer residues comprising the polymer. Polymers that contain only a single type of <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> are known as homopolymers, while polymers containing [...] two or more types of repeat units are known as copolymers. Terpolymers contain three types of repeat units.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{approaches}} currently used to synthesize CMPs must {{be carried out}} under anhydrous and oxygen-free environments due to the presence of metal catalysts. Due to the use of metal catalysts, polymers inevitably have trace metals present. [...] Reactions, such as the Schiff base reaction, have garnered much attention in that the reactions are metal free. In Schiff base, amine based monomers and aldehyde containing monomers undergo a reaction to create the <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> for CMPs. Schiff base is a preferred metal free method due to industrial scale cheap monomers containing multiple aldehyde functional groups. Another benefit of Schiff base is nitrogen is produced in creating CMPs, which could be beneficial for many applications.|$|E

The SSRs, which usually have a higher mutation rate, are easily genotyped using PCR, used as markers for phylogenetic analysis and in marker-assisted breeding when located on nuclear chromosomes. Microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected using MISA perl script with thresholds of ten <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> for mononucleotide SSRs, five <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> for dinucleotide SSRs, four <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> for trinucleotide SSRs, and three <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> for tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide SSRs (Thiel et al. 2003).|$|R

40|$|A {{micromechanics}} analysis {{modeling method}} {{was developed to}} analyze the damage progression and fatigue failure of fabric reinforced composite structures, especially for the brittle ceramic matrix material composites.

The thermal and mechanical properties of the <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> cell were considered as {{the same as those}} of the global composite structure. The three-phase micromechanics, the shear-lag, and the continuum fracture mechanics models were integrated with a statistical model in the <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> cell to predict the progressive damages and fatigue life of the composite structures. The global structure failure was defined as the loss of loading capability of the <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> cell, which depends on the stiffness reduction due to material slice failures and nonlinear material properties in the <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> cell.

2500|$|Since 1979, Suzuki {{coupling}} {{has been}} an efficient method for aryl-aryl bond formation. [...] The reaction conditions of Suzuki coupling {{for the formation of}} a biphenyl <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> for CMPs include the palladium catalyzed cross-coupling of an organo-boron reagent with an organic halide or sulfonate in the presence of some base. An advantage of using this method to synthesize CMPs is that reaction conditions are mild, there is commercial availability of organo-boron reagents, and the reaction has high functional group tolerance. This method is best used for large scale synthesis of CMPs. [...] A drawback to Suzuki coupling is the reaction being oxygen sensitive, often leading to side products, as well as the reaction needing to be degassed.|$|E
2500|$|Polypropylene {{is liable}} to chain {{degradation}} from exposure to heat and UV radiation such as that present in sunlight. Oxidation usually occurs at the tertiary carbon atom present in every <b>repeat</b> <b>unit.</b> A free radical is formed here, and then reacts further with oxygen, followed by chain scission to yield aldehydes and carboxylic acids. In external applications, it shows up as a network of fine cracks and crazes that become deeper and more severe with time of exposure. For external applications, UV-absorbing additives must be used. Carbon black also provides some protection from UV attack. The polymer can also be oxidized at high temperatures, a common problem during molding operations. Anti-oxidants are normally added to prevent polymer degradation. [...] Microbial communities isolated from soil samples mixed with starch {{have been shown to}} be capable of degrading polypropylene.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A novel Plasmodium falciparum gene, denoted cg 2 gene, {{has been}} {{recently}} discovered, and a distinct genotype, characterized by 12 point mutations and 3 size polymorphisms, {{has been shown}} to be associated with chloroquine resistance in laboratory-adapted parasite strains. One of the polymorphic regions, denoted the omega region, consists of 16 tandem <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> in chloroquine-resistant strains, while the chloroquine-sensitive strains have either # 15 or $ 17 <b>repeat</b> <b>units.</b> In this study, the in vivo and in vitro responses were compared with the number of <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> in the omega region of the cg 2 gene for 75 Cameroonian isolates determined either by DNA sequencing or agarose gel electrophoresis. The 16 -repeat units that characterize the resistant strains were found in 10 chloroquine-sensitive isolates (50 % inhibitory concentration [IC 50], 100 nM) and 30 chloroquine-resistant isolates (IC 50 $ 100 nM). Thirty-five isolates (28 chloroquine-sensitive isolates and 7 chloroquine-resistant isolates) displayed # 15 or $ 17 <b>repeat</b> <b>units.</b> Of the 18 patients responding with treatment failure, 15 were infected with parasites carrying 16 <b>repeat</b> <b>units.</b> Twenty-eight patients (11 with isolates carrying 16 <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> and 17 with isolates carrying # 15 or $ 17 <b>repeat</b> <b>units)</b> showed an adequate clinical response.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} the 5 S ribosomal RNA genes (5 S rDNA) in a group of 6 species belonging to 4 genera of Mugilidae. In these 6 species, the relatively short 5 S rDNA <b>repeat</b> <b>units,</b> generated by PCR and ranging in size from 219 to 257 bp, show a high level of intragenomic homogeneity of both coding and spacer regions (NTS-I). Phylogenetic reconstructions based on this data set highlight the greater phylogenetic and genetic diversity of Mugil cephalus and Oedalechilus labeo compared with the genera Liza and Chelon. Comparative sequence analysis revealed significant conservation of the short 5 S rDNA <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> across Chelon and Liza. Moreover, a second size class of 5 S rDNA <b>repeat</b> <b>units,</b> ranging from roughly 800 to 1100 bp, was produced in the Liza and Chelon samples. Only short 5 S rDNA <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> were found in M. cephalus and O. labeo.
