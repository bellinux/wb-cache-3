A tribocharging automated system has been rigged to perform charge retention tests on samples of such composites. Special testing procedures, based on a suitable definition of Surface Voltage (or tribocharge) have been devised and implemented to investigate the charge release capability of three different textiles. The discharge process, represented by the SV(t) plots measured via a non-contact probe system, has been experimentally studied via a 3 synthetic parameters approach. The analysis of the tests output allowed to focus the role of the square dimensions, of the r. h. (<b>relative</b> <b>humidity)</b> <b>factor</b> and of the type of conductive thread...|$|E

In this study, we explore a new framework for assessment and identification of hidden ecological factors to the incidence of malaria. A statistical technique, partial least squares path modeling and exploratory factor analysis, is employed to identify hidden ecological factors. Three hidden factors are identified: Factor I is related to minimum temperature and <b>relative</b> <b>humidity,</b> <b>Factor</b> II is related to maximum temperature and solar radiation and Factor III is related to precipitation and wind speed, respectively.

40|$|Plant disease {{surveillance}} {{is used in}} biosecurity {{to enable}} early detection of incursions of new pathogens, to monitor disease status during eradication programs, and to demonstrate that an area is free of a particular pathogen for trade purposes. Monitoring for plant pathogens currently relies on detection of symptoms by suitably skilled personnel, but the difficulties of distinguishing diseases based on symptoms, and of timing surveillance to coincide with symptom expression, can result in new pathogens not being detected until they are already widespread. The aims of this research were, firstly, to investigate the efficacy of spore trapping combined with quantitative PCR diagnostic assays for biosecurity surveillance and, secondly, to use the system to test predictions of spore release generated by epidemiological models. Methodology for detection and quantification of airborne spores using spore traps and quantitative PCR assays was optimised and tested on three model pathogens endemic on pulse and oilseed crops in South Australia: 1. Leptosphaeria maculans, cause of blackleg (phoma stem canker) of canola (oilseed rape, Brassica napus). 2. Didymella pinodes, which causes ascochyta blight (blackspot) of field pea (Pisum sativum), and 3. Ascochyta rabiei, cause of ascochyta blight of chickpea (Cicer arietinum). The PCR tests were shown to be both specific and sensitive when applied to spore trap samples, and results were borne out by close correlation with microscopic counts of ascospores on tapes of trapped spores. Poor reproducibility of results was largely addressed by replication of PCR assays and use of an exogenous control to allow variation {{to be taken into}} account. Implications of the imprecision remaining in the system are discussed in relation to epidemiological research leading to biosecurity surveillance. Storage of spore trap samples at - 20 °C was found to be a suitable system for ascospores of L. maculans, with no reduction in the yield of DNA after 6 months. The finding that DNA yield from conidia of L. maculans was reduced, however, indicated that further research may be needed before applying these findings to other species and/or types of spore. The potential for reduced yield of DNA from spore trap samples collected during periods of extremely hot weather, and the possibility that dust may affect yields, were identified as factors to be considered in assessing qPCR results. Nevertheless, the system proved to be generally robust in weather conditions prevailing in southern Australia. The data from 2 years of monitoring for model pathogens were used to calibrate epidemiological models to the field site and to refine the models, as required. The findings that ascospores of D. pinodes were released during rain events in the summer led to incorporation of an additional cycle of ascospore formation and release, commencing during the cropping season, into the G 1 Blackspot Manager model (model pathogen 1). Furthermore, the detection of D. pinodes DNA in spore trap samples on rainless days led to the incorporation of a <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> <b>factor</b> into the model. A minor modification was made to the Blackleg Sporacle model to smooth the model prediction curve (model pathogen 2). These changes, and the calibration of the models to the field site, need to be validated in further seasons. The results of monitoring for D. rabiei indicated that few or no ascospores were released from chickpea stubble, suggesting that the second mating type required for sexual reproduction, Mat 1 - 1, either does not occur in South Australia or is present as only a very small proportion of the population (model pathogen 3). In investigating questions arising from the above experiments, it was found that 7 -month-old canola stubble exposed to prolonged dry conditions continued to release ascospores immediately upon wetting, for up to 5 months (i. e. up until early summer, 12 months after harvest), but did not continue beyond the (Australian) early summer into the mid- and late-summer and autumn of the following year. This suggested that infested canola stubble from the season before the last is unlikely to be a significant source of infection for the current year’s canola crop emerging in autumn. DNA of D. pinodes was readily detected in dust generated at harvest but application of the dust to field pea seedlings failed to cause blackspot. The implications of these findings in relation to disease spread and biosecurity surveillance are discussed. The results obtained using the optimised methodology for spore trapping coupled with PCR diagnostics provided a good match with those obtained using trap plants, and with predictions of epidemiological models. Spore trapping coupled with qPCR proved to be a useful tool for epidemiological studies, which can be applied in biosecurity surveillance. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The WINDOW PANE program was used to search for weather factors highly correlated with blast. Stepwise and r-square linear regression procedures were then applied to generate the predictive models at each site. Models developed at Icheon, South Korea included <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> and rainfall <b>factors</b> {{as the most important}} predictors of disease. Temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> <b>factors</b> were components of models at Cavinti and the IRRI blast nursery in the Philippines.

Model predictions were also used to determine the effects on blast of sowing time, nitrogen amount, and increase in temperature. Limitations of the models are discussed. Path coefficient analysis was used to identify direct and indirect influences exerted by weather factors on blast. The largest direct influence on disease was exerted by <b>humidity</b> <b>factors</b> at Icheon; temperature, rainfall, and wind speed factors at Cavinti; temperature and <b>humidity</b> <b>factors</b> at IRRI; rainfall factors at Gunung Medan; and temperature factors at Sitiung. Although path coefficient values (Py) were estimated from the decomposition of correlation coefficients, factors that had a high correlation with disease parameters did not always give high Py.

Cluster analysis of 24 hypothetical sowing months at Cavinti, the IRRI blast nursery, and Sitiung sites revealed three blast proneness groups. Principal component analysis showed that IR 50 cultivar would be susceptible at Cavinti at any time of the year. Sowing C 22 cultivar at Cavinti in Group I and III months would make it prone to panicle and leaf blast, respectively. At the IRRI blast nursery, leaf and panicle infections on IR 50 would be probable only in Group I and II months.

In part II of this study the tribofilm thickness and wear results obtained experimentally are used to develop a semi-deterministic approach to implement the effect of humidity in wear prediction of boundary lubrication for the first time. Two approaches were used for this purpose; firstly, a modification factor {{was found to be}} suitable for Archard’s wear equation to be able to account for the effect of <b>relative</b> <b>humidity.</b> This <b>factor</b> is found to be good for engineering designers to be able to predict the lifetime of machine parts.

40|$|Although {{parasitoid}} wasps {{have shown}} promise as model systems for studying life history evolution, empirical studies of certain traits in these small insects have proven difficult. In this dissertation, two "black boxes" {{in the life}} histories of female parasitoids are examined: (1) oosorption, and (2) dispersal by flight. I first demonstrate that a short-lived species with high early reproductive investment (Eretmocerus eremicus) resorbs eggs, which runs counter {{to the notion that}} the time costs of oosorption are prohibitive to such wasps. Instead, it appears that the resorption mechanism in E. eremicus is capable of both decreasing costs and increasing nutritional benefits of oosorption relative to that of other parasitoid species. In addition, a literature review reveals four functional hypotheses for parasitoid oosorption: (1) age-related egg apoptosis, (2) conservation of ovarian capacity, and (3) nutrient allocation to either longevity or future oogenesis. As none of these can be rejected, I propose several avenues of future research: 1) refinement of physiological techniques to measure nutrient traffic into and out of eggs, 2) morphological phylogenetic studies of oosorption mechanisms, 3) development of lifetime nutrient budgets for parasitoids with different reproductive life histories, 4) examination of decay rates of oocytes with different yolk types, and 5) increased study of ovarian dynamics in pro-ovigenic parasitoids. Next, I describe results from a vertical flight chamber study designed to test hypotheses regarding the correlation between pre-oviposition dispersal and reproductive effort in parasitoid wasps. This experiment was conducted on 1 -d-old female whitefly parasitoids from five species in two genera. The two Eretmocerus spp. showed a higher flight propensity than the three Encarsia spp. This may be, in part, due to a more time limited life history in the former. Within species, egg load did not correlate well with flight propensity for all species examined. Finally, among individuals of Er. eremicus, the relationship between effective flight distance and egg load appears to be context dependent, as data consistent with both positive and negative correlations were collected. Correlational changes between flight distance and egg load may be due to variation in biotic (female longevity) or abiotic (temperature, <b>relative</b> <b>humidity)</b> <b>factors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Stomata {{arranged}} in crypts with trichomes are commonly {{considered to be}} adaptations to aridity due to the additional diffusion resistance associated with this arrangement; however, information {{on the effect of}} crypts on gas exchange, relative to stomata, is sparse. In this study, three-dimensional Finite Element models of encrypted stomata were generated using commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics software. The models were based on crypt and stomatal architectural characteristics of the species Banksia ilicifolia, examined microscopically, and variations thereof. In leaves with open or partially closed stomata, crypts reduced transpiration by less than 15 % compared with nonencrypted, superficially positioned stomata. A larger effect of crypts was found only in models with unrealistically high stomatal conductances. Trichomes inside the crypt had virtually no influence on transpiration. Crypt conductance varied with stomatal conductance, boundary layer conductance, and ambient <b>relative</b> <b>humidity,</b> as these <b>factors</b> modified the three-dimensional diffusion patterns inside crypts. It was concluded that {{it is unlikely that the}} primary function of crypts and crypt trichomes is to reduce transpiration...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Grazing on {{the mountainous}} forested ranges of the Camp Creek Unit, Malhuer National Forest, was typified by {{irregular}} distribution of free-ranging cattle. A combination {{of management and}} physical, topographic constraints caused cattle {{to concentrate on the}} riparian zone early in the grazing season in 1977 and 1978. A large percentage of cattle days and vegetation utilization on the riparian zone occurred in the first four weeks. Utilization on herbaceous vegetation was moderately heavy, 76 and 72 percent in 1977 and 1978, respectively. Impact of grazing on the most prevalent herbaceous species, Kentucky bluegrass, was minimal. Shrub use was greatest when herbaceous vegetation was more mature and less succulent. Utilization of major shrubs was not excessive in either year, and likely had no long term affects on either the abundance or vigor of the shrubs. There were no substantial physical impacts of the livestock on the unit, including the stream channel. Environmental and topographic parameters were analyzed to establish causes of cattle behavioral responses. Distinct home range groups of cattle were identified through examination of quantity and pattern of forage use, cattle distribution, herd social structure and cattle activities. The home range of one group encompassed only upland areas. Water and vegetation type were important parameters in determining area and degree of use. Vertical distance above water was {{the most important factor in}} determining vegetation utilization on moderately steep slopes. Time after sunrise and <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> <b>factors</b> were key parameters in determining kind of cattle activity and timing of the activity. Cattle grazing the research unit had a history of ADBPE when grazed in the rotation used during the study. Typically, 2 - 4 cows died of ADBPE each time this rotation was followed. Only one such acute case of ADBPE developed during this study. Conditions in both years minimized the expected incidence of the disease. In 1977, a major drought caused vegetation on the unit, where emphysema was expected to occur, to be very dry. A large number of dry cows and late season precipitation in 1978 altered cattle grazing patterns reducing the chance of ADBPE. In both years, only a small proportion of the herd was comprised of highly susceptible animals. These combined factors reduced the probability of the incidence of ADBPE in the study herd...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaporation}} {{of water}} droplets {{is involved in}} many applications: fire extinction, building and greenhouse. On the equipment of a food plant (mostly made of stainless steel), bacterial contamination can cause the deterioration of food quality and safety. To avoid this problem, cleaning by water and subsequent drying are often performed. Water stagnation, however, is observed at certain positions if the ambient conditions during the drying process are not well-controlled. The water evaporation rate depends on the room conditions (temperature, velocity, humidity). It is thus necessary to understand the evaporation mechanism of water droplets on solid surfaces {{and the influence of}} the room conditions on the evaporation rate. Experiments were performed in a wind tunnel, in which the air velocity, temperature and <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> were controlled. Water droplets were deposited onto a stainless steel plate (15 cm x 15 cm x 0. 1 cm). This plate, placed in a work zone, was exposed to several air velocities (0. 5 m s(- 1) to 2. 0 m s(- 1)), <b>relative</b> <b>humidities</b> (50 %- 85 %) and temperatures (4 degrees C- 20 degrees C). The evolution of the wet surface on the plate was observed using a camera, and the evolution of the water weight was determined using a digital balance. The influence of the initial percentage of wet surface on the water evaporation rate was studied at various ambient conditions. It was observed that the air <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> is the <b>factor</b> that has the greatest influence on the evaporation rate...|$|R
40|$|Indoor fine {{particles}} (FPs) are {{a combination of}} ambient particles that have infiltrated indoors, and particles that have been generated indoors from activities such as cooking. The objective {{of this paper was}} to estimate the infiltration factor (Finf) and the ambient/non-ambient components of indoor FPs. To do this, continuous measurements were collected indoors and outdoors for seven consecutive days in 50 non-smoking homes in Halifax, Nova Scotia in both summer and winter using DustTrak (TSI Inc) photometers. Additionally, indoor and outdoor gravimetric measurements were made for each 24 -h period in each home, using Harvard impactors (HI). A computerized algorithm was developed to remove (censor) peaks due to indoor sources. The censored indoor/outdoor ratio was then used to estimate daily Finfs and to determine the ambient and non-ambient components of total indoor concentrations. Finf estimates in Halifax (daily summer median = 0. 80; daily winter median = 0. 55) were higher than have been reported in other parts of Canada. In both winter and summer, the majority of FP was of ambient origin (daily winter median = 59 %; daily summer median = 84 %). Predictors of the non-ambient component included various cooking variables, combustion sources, <b>relative</b> <b>humidity,</b> and <b>factors</b> influencing ventilation. This work highlights the fact that regional factors can influence the contribution of ambient particles to indoor residential concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that design of timber-concrete {{composite}} (TCC) floors may be governed by serviceability or ultimate limit states and therefore, the design requirements need to be satisfied under both short- and long-term actions. However, the long-term behaviour in medium to long span beams under heavy environmental conditions mainly governs the design. Conducting experimental tests to investigate the behaviour of TCC floors are expensive to run and are time consuming whereas analytical studies offer an efficient alternative for predicting the short- and long-term responses with reasonable accuracy. Time-dependant behaviour of TCC floors is not only affected by the long-term load but also driven by the variation of the environmental conditions such as temperature and <b>relative</b> <b>humidity.</b> The <b>factors</b> that affect the long-term behaviour of TCC floors are quite complex and non-linear. Some simplified as well as more comprehensive approaches have been developed to-date and reported in literature. This paper presents a comparison of several finite element models about the behaviour of TCC systems. It starts with analytical models of timber beams under ultimate and serviceability loads. Furthermore, the finite element models developed to date for predicting the short- and long-term responses of TCC beams are discussed. This paper also outlines a novel method for analysis of TCC beams and highlights the potential of the proposed formulation to capture both the short-and long-term behaviour with sufficient accuracy...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} of anurans to bromeliads presents {{different degrees of}} interaction such as: eventual, obligatory and bromeligen. The frog species Scinax argyreornatus shows a regular association with these plants. The goal {{of this study is}} to characterise the degree of association between the frog S. argyreornatus to different species of bromeliads. We identified which species of bromeliad is regularly associated with S. argyreornatus and recognised which factors interfere with this association preference. We analysed the Concentration of Relative Dominance of frogs per bromeliad species. As possible criteria for frog association preference to different bromeliads species we established the analysis of leaves number, length and width, number of leaf axils, stored water in the axils, pH and <b>relative</b> <b>humidity,</b> among other organographic components. Our observations were analyzed by ANOVA followed by the Tukey test. We also evaluated the preference for association by the constancy of Bodenheimer. The correlation matrix indicated that the <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> is the <b>factor</b> responsible for the frog-bromeliads association, except for Aechmea sp [...] However Aechmea sp. was the species with greater constancy of occupation followed by Quesnelia arvensis and Neoregelia johannis. According to our statistical results, Aechmea sp. and Q. arvensis are not different regarding organographic parameters, but differ from N. johannis. Our observations suggest that the bromeliads organographic structure and the relativ...|$|R
40|$|Potential {{evapotranspiration}} (PET) is {{an importance}} process in water balance studies {{controlled by a}} number of meteorological factors such as temperature, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, vapor pressure gradient, <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> and biological <b>factors</b> such as vegetation type, canopy height and plant density that varied in time-scale and in spatial scale. Of all those variables, determining the most controlling factors of evapotranspiration in humid and arid area is of interest of this paper. Two sites representing humid and arid area i. e. Fermi Prairie site in Illinois and Audubon Research Ranch in Arizona respectively were investigated in this study.   The flux data employed in this study was acquired from Ameriflux Netwotk. Penmann-Monteith formula is employed in to estimate evapotranspiration rate in both sites. The result shows that the PET is in dependence on the considered meteorological factor such as shortwave radiation, vapor pressure, air temperature, wind speed, net radiation and vapor pressure deficit. It is also can be inferred from the analysis that PET is also strongly controlled by vegetation factors represented as stomatal resistance.

40|$|Among the cavernicolous species, {{invertebrates}} make up {{the majority}} of the entire cave fauna. With their extremely restricted distribution, macro-invertebrates are important in determining the health of a cave. This study was conducted to assess the diversity and abundance of macro-invertebrates in two unexplored caves in Wao, Lanao del Sur. Sampling was done through a combination of methods: hand grabbing technique, pitfall traps, visual search, and direct counting method. Ten species belonging to seven orders were recorded in Wao caves. More species were found in Cave 1. Macropathus sp. was the most abundant species comprising half of the species recorded. The huntsman spider, Heteropoda sp. 1, was found in the two sampling sites. Moderate diversity was recorded in Cave 1 while Cave 2 had low diversity. Majority of the macro-invertebrate species were found on the cave wall and floor. Guano deposition, temperature, and <b>relative</b> <b>humidity</b> are environmental <b>factors</b> which appear to be significant to the distribution of the macro-invertebrate species in the caves. Disturbances present in the caves also seem to have negatively affected the distribution of species and individuals...|$|R
