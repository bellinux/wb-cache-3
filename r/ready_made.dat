25|$|In October 1942, Manuel Richard Hornibrook was {{commissioned}} by the US Army to erect four large stores at Eagle Farm, most likely hangars 4,5,6 and 7 of an igloo design. The igloo {{is a form of}} light nailed timber arch construction. These hangars were built fronting the straight six section, as a <b>ready</b> <b>made</b> apron, with hangar 7 built for the Allied Technical Air Intelligence Unit (ATAIU) located separately {{at the end of the}} straight. These hangars were based on the US Army 104ft span timber box frame design and were clad with galvanised iron, but when that material was restricted, terne-coated iron was used, a lead-tin coating usually used for fuel tank manufacture. There were various igloo designs, but the AWC designs were considered to be far more rugged than US designs, and were designed to have a reasonably long life under winds of up to 65 miles per hour, and used standard grade Group C hardwood timber.|$|E
25|$|The {{straight}} six {{extension of}} the Doomben Racecourse was utilised as a <b>ready</b> <b>made</b> apron for the hangars which were to be built. Initial works were delayed by heavy rain for three weeks converting the ground to a quagmire, {{and as a result}} thousands of feet of ashes and coke breeze were carted from the gasworks and deposited in order to keep trucks moving with borrow material from Nudgee. By 18 February 1942 the construction of one hangar had begun and the SW-NE runway was nearing completion. Shiploads of aircraft components were arriving at the port and had to be transported to Amberley for assembly until Eagle Farm was ready. The Americans advised that the runways were urgently needed for the fighter plane protection of Brisbane, and as a result two ten-hour shifts were organised using 100 trucks which hauled 33,000 cubic yards of fill to complete the section, and on 29 March 1942 a squadron of P-39 aircraft landed.|$|E

So the eyes havebeen turned to education which unique key of the change and the necessity was born that to be shown great interest to theprogramme of the textile <b>ready</b> - <b>made</b> clothing in Turkish education system. This research fronts to textile <b>ready</b> - <b>made</b> clothingeducation subject and it focuses on factors that affect the election of the programme of the textile <b>ready</b> - <b>made</b> clothing that isapplied in Anatolian Professional High Schools, Anatolian Maiden Professional High Schools and Maiden Professional HighSchools and the demand rate to the programme (Konya, Karaman and Aksaray provinces). The universe of this study is the students of the programme of the textile <b>ready</b> - <b>made</b> clothing in Anatolian ProfessionalHigh Schools, Anatolian Maiden Professional High Schools and Maiden Professional High Schools that hold the programme ofthe textile <b>ready</b> - <b>made</b> clothing. Specimens are composed of the pupils doing the programme of the textile <b>ready</b> - <b>made</b> clothingin Anatolian Professional High Schools, Anatolian Maiden Professional High Schools and Maiden Professional High Schools from Konya, Karaman and Aksaray. Totally 418 textile <b>ready</b> - <b>made</b> clothing students 9. 10. and 11. classes in these provincesand in their towns have been included in this study. Survey method was applied in this research. The basic informations that can be reached via internet and literature will be usedin the context of this survey model.

In addition to this the headmasters of the schools have beeninterviewed and the demand for the programme of the textile <b>ready</b> - <b>made</b> clothing in these schools has been determined. Allfindings have been showed by the tables and graphs with the percentage and frequency calculations. With the aim of showing upthe relation ship between some factors with each other among these factors x 2 (khi - square) test has been applied and the resultsthat came out from them have been tabulated. According to the findings of the study, so many factors which affect the programme of the textile <b>ready</b> - <b>made</b> clothing havebeen determined. It is possible to group these factors as close environment (family, friends, relatives, guidance teachers), externalenvironment (the famous fashion designers, artists, teachers, academic members, company owners, workshop leaders, stylists,designers, tailors and, models, etc.), textile <b>ready</b> - <b>made</b> clothing symbols (showcases, fashion shows, fashion bulletins, fashionmagazines, textile magazines, fashion channels, brands, fabrics, the new model sewing machines, sewing equipment, dress forms,clothing accessories, etc [...] ), the various aspects of the programme of the textile <b>ready</b> - <b>made</b> clothing (conceptual, design, cutting,sewing, etc [...] ), the subsections of the programme of the textile <b>ready</b> - <b>made</b> clothing (Branch of the Child Clothing Design,Branch of the Sock Knitting, Branch of the Leather Ready - To - Wear, Branch of the Weaving Surface Apparel, Branch of theFlatbed Knitting (tricot) Ready - To - Wear, Branch of the Men's Clothing Design, Branch of the Men's Tailoring, Branch of theHome Textile Apparel, Branch of the Underwear Styler, Branch of the Underwear Design, Branch of the Women's ClothingDesign, Branch of the Pattern, Branch of the Quality Control (Production Controller), Branch of the Cut, Branch of the MaterialQuality Control, Branch of the Fashion-House Boutique (dressmaking), Branch of the Embroidery of the Textile and GarmentIndustry, Branch of the Textile and Garment Machinery Mechatronics, Branch of the Circular Knitting Apparel), somevocational/academic factors, (becoming skilful in order to sew, becoming skilful in order to work in a factory/an establishment,to earn a reputation in the textile sector in Turkey/abroad, get a bachelor degree and a master’s degree in this department, gainingthe ability to begin a business by dint of education that to be earned), some emotional reasons (to love sewing, to like usingcreativeness, thinking the world of figures who is fashion designers in the some television series, movies or televisionprogrammes, to be interested in technological products with regard to apparel industry, thinking the world of the textile ready -made clothing teachers, to like things which is producted by the neighbours, relatives etc. worked in this sector),vocational/academic status of the textile <b>ready</b> - <b>made</b> clothing programme’s the former graduates, the guidance service whichprovided by guidance counselor at the schools, well - known figures in this field in Turkey and in the world, the overseas positionof the programme of the textile <b>ready</b> - <b>made</b> clothing. Moreover, the status of the students’ parents as alive/dead, apart/togetherand their jobs and income levels can be counted among these factors. Also the demand for the programme of the textile ready -made clothing in the Anatolian Professional High Schools, Anatolian Maiden Professional High Schools and Maiden ProfessionalHigh Schools in Konya, Karaman and Aksaray corresponds to an extend of % 17. 5 of the students who have made their choicesfor the fields.

500|$|Burrell's {{study found}} women {{consistently}} rating Clinton more favorably than men by about ten percentage points {{during her first}} lady years. Jacobson's study found a positive correlation across all senators between being women and receiving a partisan-polarized response. Colorado State University communication studies professor Karrin Vasby Anderson describes the first lady position as a [...] "site" [...] for American womanhood, one <b>ready</b> <b>made</b> for the symbolic negotiation of female identity. In particular anderson states {{there has been a}} cultural bias towards traditional first ladies and a cultural prohibition against modern first ladies; by the time of Clinton, the first lady position had become a site of heterogeneity and paradox. Burrell, as well as biographers Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr., note that Clinton achieved her highest approval ratings as first lady late in 1998, not for professional or political achievements of her own, but for being seen as the victim of her husband's very public infidelity. University of Pennsylvania communications professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson saw Clinton as an exemplar of the double bind, who though able to live in a [...] "both-and" [...] world of both career and family, nevertheless [...] "became a surrogate on whom we projected our attitudes about attributes once thought incompatible", leading to her being placed in a variety of no-win situations. Quinnipiac University media studies professor Lisa Burns found press accounts frequently framing Clinton both as an exemplar of the modern professional working mother and as a political interloper interested in usurping power for herself. University of Indianapolis English professor Charlotte Templin found political cartoonists using a variety of stereotypes—such as gender reversal, radical feminist as emasculator and the wife the husband wants to get rid of—to portray Clinton as violating gender norms.|$|E

500|$|Mani Ratnam {{developed}} a script—originally written in English—into a film and named it Pallavi Anu Pallavi. His uncle Krishnamurthy agreed {{to produce the}} film but imposed a condition {{that it should be}} made under a limited budget in Kannada, to which he agreed. As a debutant, Mani Rahman {{wanted to make sure that}} the technical aspects of the film are good. He persuaded Balu Mahendra to do the cinematography as he found the latter's work to be very impressive. He managed to get other crew members B. Lenin (for editing), Thotta Tharani (for art direction) and Ilaiyaraaja (for music composer music), all leading craftsmen in their respective fields then. For the male lead, he cast Anil Kapoor after watching his performance in the Telugu film Vamsa Vruksham (1980). Lakshmi who was a leading actress then, was signed up as the female lead. The film explored the relationship between a young man and an older woman. Although an average grosser at the box-office, the film fetched Mani Ratnam the Best Screenplay Award from the Karnataka State Government for the year 1983. After watching Pallavi Anu Pallavi, N. G. John, a Malayalam film producer, offered him a chance to direct a film in Malayalam. Scripted by T. Damodaran, Unaru was about the corruption in labour unions of Kerala. The film was completed with in two months and got released in April 1984. Mani Ratnam attributed the failure of the film to the conflict of interests that he and the producer had. Following this, he entered Tamil cinema when G. Thyagarajan of Sathya Jyothi Films offered him a chance to direct Pagal Nilavu (1985). The film had Murali and Revathi playing lead roles. It was different from his previous two films in a way that it included dance sequences and a [...] "comedy track". However, the film turned out to be another failure for him. The same year, he directed another Tamil film Idaya Kovil, a romantic drama. He remodeled a <b>ready</b> <b>made</b> script on the lines of Charlie Chaplin's Limelight (1952). Described by himself as an unsatisfied work, the film was a major box-office success. The phase between 1983 and 1986 was the toughest of his career with only Pallavi Anupallavi being a satisfiable film; the rest three were done with a lot of [...] "compromises".|$|E
