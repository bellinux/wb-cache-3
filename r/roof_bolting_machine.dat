40|$|Among {{underground}} coal miners, {{hearing loss}} {{remains one of}} the most common occupational illnesses. In response, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducts research to reduce the noise emission of various underground coal mining equipment, an example of which is a <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machine</b> (RBM). After the removal of coal or rock, the remaining strata may be subject to fall, either from overhead (the roof) or from the side (the rib). One method used in underground coal-mines to prevent failures requires the installation of roof bolts. The <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machine</b> operator trams the machine to the required location, drills a hole into the strata, and then installs a roof bolt, supporting the roof or the rib, as the case may be. Field studies support the premise that, on average, drilling noise is the loudest noise that a <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machine</b> operator would be exposed to and contributes significantly to the operators 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 noise exposure. NIOSH has determined that the drill steel radiates a significant amount of noise during drilling. NIOSH is developing bit and chuck isolators to reduce vibration, and thus noise radiation of the drill steel, with the longer-term goal of reducing <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machine</b> operator noise exposure.

This CAC was originally developed for continuous miner operators when continuous mining machines had cabs. The need for a CAC on the continuous miner was eliminated when the cab was removed from the machine design. However, CAC development progressed to include CAC designs for a <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machine</b> to protect roof bolters from respirable coal mine dust (Goodman and Organiscak 2002; Listak and Beck 2012; Reed et al. 2017).

40|$|Many {{injuries}} are caused {{each year by}} rock falls in coal mines. Most of these {{injuries are}} not caused by major roof collapses, but from falls of smaller rocks from the immediate top or roof skin. Various surface controls are used in mines to control this surface rock. One that {{has been found to}} be very effective is roof screening. Depending on the size of the screen, roof coverage approaching 100 %can be achieved. Many mines are reluctant to use screen for primary skin control because of additional costs of time and materials, but others are having great success at both controlling costs and surface rock. Data is presented from two mines that show a dramatic reduction in roof skin injuries when screening is used. Much of this success is due to innovations in <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machines.</b> Four case studies of roof screen experience are presented along with associated costs of materials, impact on bolting advance rates, and potential ergonomic risks.

Some new dust control measures for roof bolters are canopy air curtain and air tubing (Goodman and Organiscak 2002; Goodman et al. 2006), wet exhaust conditioner (Beck 2012). However, the MSHA dust sample data still show that roof bolter operators are experiencing the similar level of dust overexposure as the other miners but potentially to dust with much high silica contents. This indicates that the drilling dust could still escape from the bolter’s collection systems in some circumstances.|$|R

40|$|Problem: Incident {{investigation}} reports do {{not usually}} contain {{enough information to}} aid in studying boom arm vertical speed for <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machines</b> to determine the impact that appendage speed had on an operator's risk of experiencing a contact. Laboratory experiments with human subjects are also not feasible because of safety and ethical issues. Method Researchers successfully developed a three-dimensional computer model that uses virtual human simulation software as the primary means to gather contact data when the boom arm touches the operator's hand, arm, head, or leg. Results: Data analysis of roof bolter simulations shows that {{the speed of the}} boom arm is {{the most important factor in}} determining the risk of an operator making contact. Regardless of other variables, contact incidents were always greater when the bolter arm was moving up, greater on the hand, and greater for the boom arm part of the machine. The reason why the subject experiences more contacts when the boom arm is moving up rather than down is that more risky behaviors occur during drilling and bolting when the boom arm is ascending. Based on the data collected, boom speeds greater than 13 in/sec result in a substantial increase in risk to the roof bolter operator of making contact. Speeds less than or equal to 13 in/sec are associated with a more modest relative risk of making contact, which represents a decrease in potential hazard. Impact on Industry: The use of such information can be quite helpful in making recommendations to machine design and task procedures to reduce the likelihood that roof bolter operators will experience injury due to contact with a moving <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machine's</b> boom arm...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{variations}} in the thickness of U. S. coal seams, there is great variability in {{the height of the}} roof where underground miners work. Restrictions imposed by low seam heights have important safety consequences. As the height of their workplace decreases, miners must stoop, duck walk, or crawl, and their vision, posture, and mobility become increasingly restricted. Low seam height also places important restrictions on the design of mobile equipment and other mining machinery. Using the employment and injury data reported to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) from 1990 to 19 % small underground bituminous coal mines with less than 50 employees were stratified by average coal seam height according to the following categories: low (? 42 "), medium (43 " 60 N), and high (? 61 "). Injury rates for both nonfatal days lost and fatality cases were examined by seam height and leading type of injury incidents. The leading types of Incidents associated with fatalities were roof falls and powered haulage equipment. In comparison to high-seam mines, miners working in low or medium seams are at higher risk of being killed by powered haulage equipment, <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machines,</b> and falls of unsupported roof. The leading types of incidents associated with nonfatal injuries were handling materials and powered haulage. As mining height decreases, miners are at increasingly higher risk of having a nonfatal injury from incidents involving <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machines,</b> load-haul-dump equipment, personnel carriers, and powered haulage conveyors. As mining height increases, miners are at increasingly higher risk of having a nonfatal injury from slips and falls and incidents involving shuttle cars and roof and rib falls.

40|$|Among {{underground}} coal miners, {{hearing loss}} {{remains one of}} the most common occupational illnesses. In response to this problem, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) conducts research to reduce the noise emission of underground coal-mining equipment, an example of which is a <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machine.</b> Field studies show that, on average, drilling noise is the most significant contributor to a <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machine</b> operator's noise exposure. NIOSH OMSHR has determined that the drill steel and chuck are the dominant sources of drilling noise. NIOSH OMSHR, Corry Rubber Corporation, and Kennametal, Inc. have developed a bit isolator that breaks the steel-to-steel link between the drill bit and drill steel and a chuck isolator that breaks the mechanical connection between the drill steel and the chuck, thus reducing the noise radiated by the drill steel and chuck, and the noise exposure of the roof bolter operator. This paper documents the evolution of the bit isolator and chuck isolator including various alternative designs which may enhance performance. Laboratory testing confirms that production bit and chuck isolators reduce the A-weighted sound level generated during drilling by 3. 7 to 6. 6 dB. Finally, this paper summarizes results of a finite element analysis used to explore the key parameters of the drill bit isolator and chuck isolator to understand the impact these parameters have on noise.

In response to this, the Pittsburgh Research Laboratory of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has initiated a project to develop engineering noise controls for roof bolting machines. Key to this research is {{an evaluation of the}} duty cycle of a typical <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machine</b> operation and this paper presents the results of such an exercise for data collected at two cooperating coalmines. The evaluation entails a time motion study of an operators' shift, logging each activity for time (e. g., tramming the machine, drilling holes, installing the roof bolt, etc.) and the noise levels associated with each task with a Larson Davis Spark 705 + dosimeter. NIOSH post processed the data to determine which tasks the operator devotes the most time to and the noise dosage accumulated during those tasks. These results provide insight into which portion of the operators' duty cycle is the most prominent contributor to noise exposure and thus, where research activities for the development of engineering noise controls should be focused. It was determined that the task of drilling holes is the most significant source of the operators' noise exposure and project research has focused on engineering noise controls to reduce the noise emissions generated during the drilling portion of the machine duty cycle...|$|E

40|$|Falls {{of small}} pieces of rock from between roof bolts {{continue}} to cause fatalities and to injure hundreds of coal miners each year. Roof screen {{is the most effective}} way to prevent these incidents, but some mines are reluctant to use it because they believe installing screen can be awkward, expensive and time-consuming.

40|$|Roof bolting {{typically}} {{follows the}} extraction of a commodity {{to help keep the}} roof from collapsing. During 2004 to 2013, roof bolter operators had the highest number of machinery-related injuries, accounting for 64. 7 percent, at underground coal mines. This paper analyzes U. S. roof bolter fatal and nonfatal lost-time injury data at underground work locations for all commodities from 2004 through 2013 and determines risk indices for six roof bolting tasks. For fatal and nonfatal incidences combined, the roof bolting tasks in order of the highest to lowest risk index were bolting, handling of materials, setting the temporary roof support (TRS), drilling, tramming, and traversing. For fatalities, the roof bolting tasks in order of the highest to lowest risk index were handling of materials, setting the TRS, bolting, drilling, traversing, and tramming. Age was found to be a significant factor. Severity of injury, indicated by days lost, was found to increase with increasing age as well as with increasing experience, largely due to the confounding of age and experience. The operation of the <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machine</b> used in underground mining should be a research priority given the high frequency and severity of incidents. The results also suggest that temporal factors may exist, so additional research is warranted to better understand these factors and potentially develop interventions.

40|$|In the U. S. {{coal mining}} industry, a large cohort of miners is at or nearing {{retirement}} age. As these miners retire, {{there will be}} a need to hire and train thousands of new and most likely younger workers. Moreover, a large portion of safety trainers will also require replacement due to retirement. In a speech before the U. S. House of Representatives (2004), Bruce Watzman, Vice President for Safety, Health and Human Resources for the National Mining Association said, '[W]e will need to replace a major portion, approximately 50 %, of the underground coal mining workforce within the next 5 - 7 years. ' The large influx of new mine workers, along with the deficit in safety trainers, creates the challenge to provide consistent and effective safety training. Given the expected high turnover of the mining workforce, it is very likely that incoming workers will have much less experience than those leaving the workforce. Unfortunately, inexperienced miners have been shown to incur the highest rate of injuries. The piece of machinery most associated with these injuries is the <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machine,</b> which accounts for 56 % of machinery-related injuries in underground coal mining. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has released a new report entitled 'Roof Bolting Machine Operators Skills Training for a Walk-Thru Roof Bolter: Trainer's Guide' (IC 9489). It is designed to help safety trainers develop structured training for new operators of walk-thru bolting machines. This resource will help trainees learn, understand, and apply knowledge and skills. Included in the trainer's guide are the following tools: a six-part DVD video series, a skills check survey, talking points, and a complete job training analysis. Also included is an exercise to help trainees learn more about their mine's roof control plan, as well as a list of supplemental training and reading materials. On-site trainers can modify this guide to fit their particular mine conditions, machines and equipment, and work procedures. The goal of every coal mine safety professional is to increase safety awareness and make mines a safer place to work. The Walk-Thru Bolting Machine Trainer's Guide will help teach new miners skills to create a safer working environment that will ultimately prevent or reduce on-the-job injuries.

40|$|Coal miners, {{especially}} {{roof bolter}} and continuous miner operators, {{work in a}} hazardous underground environment where they are often exposed to poor roof conditions. Nearly 500 rock fall injuries are reported each year, and 99 % of them are caused by rocks falling from between the <b>roof</b> <b>bolts.</b> These loose rocks that injure miners are usually just a few inches thick, but on average weigh 280 pounds. NIOSH has found that most rock fall injuries can be prevented by installing roof screen during the <b>bolting</b> cycle. <b>Roof</b> screen is a sheet made of steel wires in a grid pattern. When screen is bolted up against the mine roof, it provides far more coverage than any common surface control used in the mines today. Because more mine roof is covered, there is less chance that a rock will fall and injure a miner. The facts about roof screen are shown in the new NIOSH video entitled "Make It Safer With Roof Screen. " Using extensive underground footage, the 7 -minute video shows how well screen keeps loose rock from falling in difficult roof conditions. Techniques for installing screen from both outside-controlled and walk-thru <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machines</b> are shown.

40|$|The Surveillance Program {{improves}} worker {{safety and}} health by identifying and tracking workplace injuries, ill- nesses, hazards, deaths and exposures in the United States. This snapshot shows recent accomplishments and upcoming work. What are our priorities? The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Hearing Loss Prevention Program works with partners in industry, labor, trade associations, professional organizations, and academia. The program focuses on eliminating new cases of occupational noise-induced hearing loss. What do we do? 1. Develop noise controls to reduce the noise emitted by the machinery and equipment that produce hazardous noise levels. 2. Reduce noise-induced hearing loss through interventions targeting hearing protection devices. Although engineering and administrative controls are more effective, and {{should be the first}} steps taken to reduce noise exposure, personal protection devices are increasingly relied upon as a means to reduce noise exposures for workers (see hierarchy of controls graphic). 3. Develop evidence-based best practices for hearing loss prevention by developing NIOSH "best practices" guidelines and NIOSH Criteria documents. 4. Identify, quantify and reduce risk factors associated with hearing loss due to exposures. Continuous noise risks are well understood, but much less is known about other intermittent and impulsive noise exposures. What have we accomplished? 1. Commercialized noise controls in mining. For example, the dual sprocket conveyor chain for the continuous mining machine and a drill bit isolator for a <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machine</b> are both commercially available and used in the field. 2. Developed the NIOSH web resources for Buy Quiet, an initiative that encourages manufacturers to design quieter equipment, and encourage companies to purchase or rent quieter machinery. 3. Updated the NIOSH Engineering Noise Control topic web page with new resources. 4. Demonstrated the ability to predict noise emissions from machinery using a NIOSH-developed numerical modeling methodology and field validation. 5. Developed a webinar and hosted three seminars to promote the use of fit-testing for more than 200 hearing conservation and safety professionals. 6. Developed methods for testing and rating hearing protector performance and assessing exposure risk that were included in the Department of Defense MIL STD 1474 E noise limit criteria acquisition standard promulgated in April 2015. 7. Examined the adequacy of different exchange rates, 3 versus 5 decibels (dB), to assess the risk of noise-induced hearing loss for noise-exposed workers. 8. Published surveillance data on trends for hearing loss over 3 decades and on the prevalence of hearing loss by sectors. What's next? 1. Create a NIOSH topic web page for Hearing Protector Fit-Testing to provide the information about evidence-based best practices to integrate fit-testing into hearing loss prevention programs. 2. Play a key leadership role in revising the American National Standard for Estimating Risk of incurring Occupational Hearing Loss, ANSI S 3. 44. The update will include recent NIOSH-derived reference data for persons as a function of age and gender. 3. Publish the results of a multi-laboratory study that compared three hearing protector fit-test systems. 4. Complete a meta-analysis of studies comparing the use of 3 -dB and 5 -dB exchange rates. 5. Publish a paper on the prevalence of hearing loss in healthcare. 6. Develop and demonstrate a retrofit package to reduce underground haul truck noise by 3 - 5 dB(A) and more than double allowable exposure time. 7. Complete the smartphone noise measurement app comparison study to demonstrate the feasibility of smartphones as noise measurement devices when equipped with an adequate microphone sensor.

The trainer's decisions on where to start, how to organize the on-the-job and classroom training portions, and when and how to offer different aspects of the training will be based on (1) a pretraining assessment of the trainee's knowledge and skills and (2) the trainer's experience in conducting skills training. The "Skill Check" section might be useful for deciding where training should start among miners who have underground experience but limited knowledge of roof-bolting techniques. Every job carries a learning curve and likely has a number of "teachable moments" where significantly new knowledge and skills can be learned. The videos on the DVD that accompany this guide can be shown at the beginning of training to give trainees an idea of what the job entails and related requirements. They can also be used within the training cycle (after the trainee has some experience in the job) to reinforce key points or as a trigger for eliciting questions about particularly difficult parts of the job. The video segments are meant to be visual models of good performance. They are designed to elicit discussion on good (lower risk) ways to do the job. In this context, they can be used very creatively at different times within the training cycle. The section on "Talking Points" offers a number of questions {{that can be used in}} the classroom to support and elaborate on certain aspects of the job duties. If the trainee has a fair amount of underground experience, some of the questions can also be used to support the pretraining assessment (i. e., skill check) of knowledge and skills. Likewise, some of the questions can also be used while teaching on the job to reinforce key points affecting safety, production, or maintenance. The section dealing with a mine's roof control plan should be used at various times in the training cycle to make sure the trainee understands the plan and knows how to apply it in performing the job. The supplemental materials offer additional resources that can be used to support initial job training or follow-up. Learning continues well after an individual has been trained. The supplemental materials can help reinforce good operating skills and provide an opportunity for further discussion on better ways to do the job.

40|$|Instructional {{material}} to accompany video "Make it safer with roof screen" published 2004. "Coal miners, especially roof bolter and continuous miner operators, {{work in a}} hazardous underground environment where they are often exposed to poor roof conditions. Nearly 500 rock fall injuries are reported each year, and 99 % of them are caused by rocks falling from between the <b>roof</b> <b>bolts.</b> These loose rocks that injure miners are usually just a few inches thick, but on average weigh 280 pounds. NIOSH has found that most rock fall injuries can be prevented by installing roof screen during the <b>bolting</b> cycle. <b>Roof</b> screen is a sheet made of steel wires in a grid pattern. When screen is bolted up against the mine roof, it provides far more coverage than any common surface control used in the mines today. Because more mine roof is covered, there is less chance that a rock will fall and injure a miner. The facts about roof screen are shown in the new NIOSH video entitled "Make It Safer With Roof Screen. " Using extensive underground footage, the 7 -minute video shows how well screen keeps loose rock from falling in difficult roof conditions. Techniques for installing screen from both outside-controlled and walk-thru <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machines</b> are shown. The video also provides safe handling tips, best practices, and information about machine technology that can greatly improve material handling.

40|$|This report {{examines}} the boom arm vertical speed for <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machines</b> {{to study a}} moving boom arm appendage at different speeds during different work scenarios. The goal {{of this study is}} to determine the impact of the appendage speed on the likelihood of the operator's hand, arm, head, or leg making contact, such as touching the moving appendage. The overall research goal is to reduce workers' risks to injury from exposure to underground mining machinery. Accident investigation reports from the Mine Safety and Health Administration do not usually contain enough information to aid in studying this problem, and lab experiments with human subjects are not feasible because of safety issues. As an alternative, researchers used a unique computer simulation model that uses a virtual human, vision tracking, and generates random virtual human motions and risky work behaviors. By using specialized software to simulate the computer model, researchers accurately identified potential hazards of tasks where it is not possible to perform experiments with human subjects. Results of a frequency distribution analytic approach show that, regardless of other variables, contact incidents were always greater when the boom was moving up, always greater on the hand, and always greater for the boom arm part of the machine. The reason why the subject experiences more contacts when the boom arm is moving up rather than down is that more risky behaviors occur during drilling and bolting when the boom is ascending. Results of a cross-tabulation analytic approach show that the 25 th- percentile operators experienced more contacts than other operator sizes and had most of their contacts during a boom speed of 13 in/sec. The hand-on-boom behavior during drilling and bolting tasks experienced more contacts than other work behaviors, and both tasks had most of their contacts during speed 13 in/sec. The 60 -in seam experienced more contacts than other seam heights and had most of the contacts during speed 16 in/sec. For univariate logistic regression models, seam height is the most important predictor of the probability of a contact. However, a multivariate logistic regression model predicted contacts are more likely with the both-knee work posture in the 60 -in seam, a 25 th-percentile operator compared to a 55 th-percentile operator, and speeds 16 and 22 in/sec compared to 7 in/sec. Results of a survival analytic approach suggest that controlling the boom speed is the most important factor in determining the risk of an operator making contact. Based on the data collected, boom speeds greater than 13 in/sec result in a substantial increase in risk to the roof bolter operator making contact. Speeds less than or equal to 13 in/sec are associated with a more modest relative risk of making contact, which represents a decrease in potential hazard. Virtual operator's response time has little effect on the number of contacts experienced. The mining industry can use the information in this study to reduce the likelihood that roof bolter operators will experience injury due to contact with a moving <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machine's</b> boom arm.

40|$|In {{collaboration}} with Kennametal Inc. and Corry Rubber Corporation, the U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) developed a drill bit isolator to address noise overexposures associated with <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machines</b> in underground coal mines. NIOSH laboratory studies {{confirmed that the}} drill bit isolator reduces noise during drilling. Field studies were needed to confirm that a noise reduction could be obtained under working conditions and that the device was sufficiently durable. This paper reports results of field tests of the device conducted at five underground coal mines. Noise reduction was assessed by comparing the operator's noise exposure during drilling with and without the drill bit isolator. Durability was assessed by recording the number of holes and total feet drilled with each bit isolator until either the test period ended or the device failed. The results from these tests showed that the device is an effective noise control in a mine environment. The field-tested drill bit isolators provided a noise reduction of 3 - 5 dB(A). Of nine devices tested for durability, five exceeded 610 m (2, 000 ft) drilled and two exceeded 762 m (2, 500 ft) drilled before failure. Durability issues found in the field tests led to final production optimizations that {{have resulted in a}} commercially available product for drilling with 35 -mm- (1. 3 -in. -) diameter roof bits and hexagonal drill steels.

30|$|Canopy {{air curtain}} (CAC) {{technology}} has been developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for use on continuous miners and subsequently <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machines</b> in underground coal mines to protect operators of these machines from overexposure to respirable coal mine dust. The next logical progression {{is to develop a}} CAC for shuttle cars to protect operators from the same overexposures. NIOSH awarded a contract to Marshall University and J.H. Fletcher to develop the shuttle car CAC. NIOSH conducted laboratory testing to determine the dust control efficiency of the shuttle car CAC. Testing was conducted on two different cab configurations: a center drive similar to that on a Joy 10 SC 32 AA cab model and an end drive similar to that on a Joy 10 SC 32 AB cab model. Three different ventilation velocities were tested— 0.61, 2.0, 4.3  m/s (120, 400, and 850 fpm). The lowest, 0.61  m/s (120 fpm), represented the ventilation velocity encountered during loading by the continuous miner, while the 4.3  m/s (850 fpm) velocity represented ventilation velocity airflow over the shuttle car while tramming against ventilation airflow. Test results showed an average of the dust control efficiencies ranging from 74 to 83 % for 0.61  m/s (120 fpm), 39 %– 43 % for 2.0  m/s (400 fpm), and 6 %– 16 % for 4.3  m/s (850 fpm). Incorporating an airflow spoiler to the shuttle car CAC design and placing the CAC so that it is located 22.86  cm (9  in.) forward of the operator improved the dust control efficiency to 51 %– 55 % for 4.3  m/s (850 fpm) with minimal impact on dust control efficiencies for lower ventilation velocities. These laboratory tests demonstrate that the newly developed shuttle car CAC has the potential to successfully protect shuttle car operators from coal mine respirable dust overexposures.|$|R
40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the effects of}} mining height on injury rates in U. S. underground nonlongwall bituminous coal mines, controlling for both the employment size of the mine and the mining methods. Using the mine-level employment and injury data reported to the Mine Safely and Health Administration, mines were stratified by average coal seam height (60 in) and by {{the average number of}} employees working at the mine (99 employees). To reduce the confounding effects of mining method on injury rates, mines using longwall mining methods were identified and excluded from analysis. The employment data show that as the mine size increases, the proportion of hours worked in low seams decreases substantially. Additionally, miners injured in small, low- scam mines arc, on average, younger and less experienced than those injured in large high-seam mines. Nonfatal disabling and fatal injury rates were computed within each category of employment size and seam height for the major types of accidents (ground falls, powered haulage equipment, machinery, handling materials, slips and falls, and hand tools). Our findings suggest that, regardless of the employment size, as mining height increases, miners are at increasingly higher risk of injury from accidents due to slips or falls and accidents involving shuttle cars and falls of ground. As mining height decreases, miners are at higher risk 01 injury from accidents involving <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>machines,</b> load-haul-dump types of powered haulage equipment, personnel carriers, and powered haulage conveyors. On the other hand, regardless of the height of the coal seam, miners working in large underground mines had higher rates of injuries resulting from accidents involving handling materials and nonpowered hand tools, but lower rates of injury from accidents involving continuous mining machines and lower rates of fatal injuries from falls of supported and unsupported mine roof. Finally, miners working at small mines in low or medium seams are at higher risk of being fatally injured by a ljll of unsupported mine roof. These findings suggest the importance of' considering the working height of the mine, as well as the employment size of the mining operation, when developing intervention strategies to reduce injury risk to underground coal miners. Results also identify the need to further explore how mining height contributes to the frequency and severity of injuries...|$|R
40|$|An {{effective}} {{technique to}} minimize miners' respirable dust and diesel exposure on mobile mining equipment {{is to place}} mine operators in enclosed cabs with designed filtration and pressurization systems. Many factors affect the performance of these enclosed cab systems, {{and one of the}} most significant factors is the effectiveness of the filtration system. High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) -type filters are typically used because they are highly efficient at capturing all types and sizes of particles, including those in the submicron range such as diesel particulate matter (DPM). However, in laboratory tests, minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) 16 filters have proven to be highly efficient for capturing DPM and respirable dust. Also, MERV 16 filters can be less restrictive to cab airflow and less expensive than HEPA filters. To verify their effectiveness in the field, MERV 16 filters were used in the enclosed cab filtration system on a face drill and <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> mining <b>machine</b> and tested at an underground limestone mine. Test results showed that DPM and respirable dust concentrations were reduced by more than 90 % when the cabs were properly sealed. However, when the cab door was opened periodically throughout the shift, the reduction efficiency of the MERV 16 filters was reduced to 80 % on average.

Based on this information, <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> design criteria for modern <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> systems will be developed for implementation in real time. For the prediction of roof geology and stability condition in real time, a micro processor was used and a program developed to monitor and record the drilling parameters of roof bolter. These parameters include feed pressure, feed flow (penetration rate), rotation pressure, rotation rate, vacuum pressure, oil temperature of hydraulic circuit, and signals for controlling machine. From the results of a series of laboratory and underground tests so far, feed pressure is found to be a good indicator for identifying the voids/fractures and estimating the roof rock strength. The method for determining quantitatively the location and the size of void/fracture and estimating the roof rock strength from the drilling parameters of roof bolter was developed. Also, a set of computational rules has been developed for in-mine roof using measured roof drilling parameters and implemented in MRGIS (Mine Roof Geology Information System), a software package developed to allow mine engineers {{to make use of the}} large amount of roof drilling parameters for predicting roof geology properties automatically.
