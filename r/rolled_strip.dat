The coil is then reduced by a single stand cold roll steel mill straight away or reversing mill or in a tandem mill consisting of several single stands in a series. The strip is reduced to approximately final thickness by cold-rolling directly, or with the inclusion of an annealing operation at some intermediate thickness to facilitate further cold reduction or to obtain mechanical properties desired in the finished product.

40|$|Increase of both <b>roll</b> and <b>strip</b> surface {{temperatures}} can significantly affect a rolling process, <b>roll</b> conditions and <b>strip</b> mechanical properties. A comprehensive thermal analysis in cold rolling, {{especially in a}} mixed film regime, is needed to understand how thermal fields develop in <b>roll</b> and <b>strip</b> during rolling. It requires a simultaneous solution of the mixed film model for friction in the roll bite and the thermal model for <b>roll</b> and <b>strip</b> thermal fields. This paper presents a numerical procedure to analyse strip rolling process using lubrication with oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions. The thermal model includes the effect of heat generation due to the strip deformation and frictional shear stress at the asperity contacts. The numerical analysis employs a coupled thermal model and a mixed film lubrication model for calculating the friction and the asperity deformation in the bite. The thermal model considers the initial temperatures of the <b>roll</b> and <b>strip,</b> temperature rise due to the strip plastic deformation and friction. While the O/W mixed-film lubrication model {{takes into account the}} effect of surface roughness and oil concentration (%vol) of the emulsion. The thermal effect is analysed in terms of strip surface temperature and roll temperature, which are influenced by rolling parameters such as reduction, rolling speed, oil concentration in the emulsion. The results of the parametric study indicate that the effect of oil concentration on the thermal field is relatively small compared to that of reduction ratio and rolling speed. The reduction ratio increases the maximum interface temperature in the roll bite. In the mixed film regime, rolling speed also increases the maximum interface temperature and alters the temperature field of the strip. The numerical procedure was validated against known experimental data and can readily be extended to hot rolling or used to analyse <b>roll</b> <b>strip</b> temperature subjected to different cooling system...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Present {{work was}} aimed at {{developing}} welding technology applicable for hot and cold <b>rolled</b> <b>strips</b> made of high alloy martensitic steels. Electron beam (EB) and TIG welding processes parameters were worked out for strips of the 2 N 11 K 13 H 3 M, N 19 M 4 T, H 11 N 10 M 2 T and PH 13 - 8 steel grades (unconventional maraging and precipitation hardening stainless steel grades). Design/methodology/approach: The heats of the steels were laboratory vacuum melted, forged and then hot and cold rolled. Welding process parameters were experimentally selected. Quality of the welds was evaluated by several non-destructive techniques and metallographic examination. Hardness distribution and tensile properties of welded strips were analyzed, and {{post weld heat treatment}} was proposed. Findings: All four steel grades studied were suitable for the electron beam welding and optimum process parameters were worked out for the 3 mm strips. The suitability of the steels to welding using the TIG process was tested with 1. 5 mm strips. Apart from the high cobalt maraging steel, which was not available in the form of thin strips, the other steels were welded successfully in TIG process. After welding, strength of the steels could be largely restored by full heat treatment. Research limitations/implications: Further research is needed on weld microstructure evolution, affected by welding processes, to improve fracture properties of welds. Practical implications: Welding technology of the hot and cold <b>rolled</b> <b>strips</b> of the four steel grades, high alloy martensitic grade, was developed, which along with very high mechanical properties and ductile fracture modes, make the steels suitable for advanced structural applications. Originality/value: Progress achieved in welding technology development is of practical value for manufacture of the structural elements, made of high alloy martensitic steels in the form of hot and cold <b>rolled</b> <b>strips...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This study {{sought to}} examine the {{suitability}} of the continuous strip casting process as a new fabrication method for the Ag-Cu brazing alloy. Several continuous strip casting processes such as planar flow casting, melt dragging, and twin <b>roll</b> <b>strip</b> casting were applied to the manufacture of the Ag- 32 %Cu strip. In particular, twin <b>roll</b> <b>strip</b> casting was found to realize the best strip shaping ability and microstructural homogeneity. The effect of aging heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of a Ag-Cu strip was also investigated through tensile test, hardness test, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observations, and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Tensile results showed gradually decreasing strengths and simultaneously increasing elongation with longer aging time. An appropriate TS strength of 283 MPa and a significantly enhanced plasticity of 41 % were realized with aging condition of 670 o C/ 2 hrs. Finally, twin-rolled strips 1 mm thick could be cold-rolled to a very thin strip (80 ~ 100 µm thickness). The microstructural evolution and crystalline morphologies of Ag-Cu metastable strips were also investigated and related to the mechanical properties...|$|R
