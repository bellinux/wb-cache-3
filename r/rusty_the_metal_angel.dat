50|$|The manga {{has been}} adapted {{into a series}} of three console based {{platform}} video games for the Super Famicom. The first of these was more closely based on the comics. The second pitted Ackman against an angelic rock group called <b>the</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Angels.</b> <b>The</b> last saw Ackman face a flamboyantly gay pedophile police officer, and saw Ackman teaming up with his longtime rival Tenshi-kun. Both characters were playable and could be switched between. These games were action platformers like most licensed games of the day, with gameplay vaguely similar to Mega Man. There was also a handheld game for the Game Boy that was a maze chase game like Pac-Man.|$|R
