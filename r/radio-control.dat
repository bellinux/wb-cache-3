5|$|In 1935–1937, {{the ship}} was {{converted}} to <b>radio-control</b> which allowed her to be maneuvered by operators aboard another ship and additional armor was added. At {{the beginning of the}} Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, she transported a battalion of naval troops to the Shanghai area. Settsu simulated the radio traffic of eight aircraft carriers {{at the beginning of the}} Pacific War in an effort to deceive Allied intelligence as to the locations and activities of the Japanese carriers. For the rest of the war she served as a target for carrier pilots. Settsu was badly damaged when Allied carrier aircraft attacked the IJN base at Kure in July 1945 and was forced to beach herself lest she sink. The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 20 November and her hulk was raised and broken up in 1946–1947.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April, Utah left Norfolk for {{sea trials}} to train her engine room crew and {{to test the}} <b>radio-control</b> equipment. The ship could be {{controlled}} at varying rates of speed and changes of course: maneuvers that a ship would conduct in battle. Her electric motors, operated by signals from the controlling ship, opened and closed throttle valves, moved her steering gear, and regulated the supply of oil to her boilers. In addition, a Sperry gyro pilot kept the ship on course. She passed her radio control trials on 6 May, and on 1 June, the ship was operated for 3 hours under radio control. On 9 June, she again left Norfolk, bound for San Pedro, California, where she joined Training Squadron 1, Base Force, United States Fleet. Starting in late July, the ship began her first round of target duty, first for the cruisers of the Pacific Fleet, and then for the battleship Nevada. She continued in this role for the next nine years; she participated in Fleet Problem XVI in May 1935, during which she served as a transport for a contingent of Marines. In June, the ship was modified to train anti-aircraft gunners {{in addition to her}} target ship duties. To perform this task, she was equipped with a new /75 caliber anti-aircraft gun in a quadruple mount for experimental testing and development of the new type of weapon.|$|E

25|$|Since 2001, {{expanded}} polypropylene (EPP) foams {{have been}} gaining in popularity and in application as a structural material in hobbyist radio control model aircraft. Unlike expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) which is friable and breaks easily on impact, EPP foam {{is able to}} absorb kinetic impacts very well without breaking, retains its original shape, and exhibits memory form characteristics which allow it to return to its original shape in {{a short amount of}} time. In consequence, a <b>radio-control</b> model whose wings and fuselage are constructed from EPP foam is extremely resilient, and able to absorb impacts that would result in complete destruction of models made from lighter traditional materials, such as balsa or even EPS foams.|$|E
25|$|Some modern amateur {{transceivers}} have embedded {{computers with}} firmware which is executed {{to provide the}} functions and features of the transceiver. This software must be provided by the original manufacturer of the equipment. Another type of software is that required to control a receiver (or transceiver) without a front panel provided. Examples of this are the Kenwood TS-B2000 and the Ten-Tec Pegasus; both transceivers are sold with PC software to provide the human interface for operation. Most transceivers with front control panels (and many receivers popular among shortwave listeners) have a computer interface such as a serial port, USB or Ethernet port. These ports are useful for satellite-tracking frequency control (Doppler tuning), station logging, digital operation, internet and special-needs accessibility. In many cases, the software adds improved or extra functions and features beyond that provided by the original design. For this reason, some operators purchase <b>radio-control</b> software for non-computerized operation even if their radio has a front control panel.|$|E

500|$|On 24 May, Nürnberg and {{the heavy}} cruiser [...] sailed from Copenhagen under escort by Devonshire, Dido, and several other warships. The {{flotilla}} arrived in Wilhelmshaven on 28 May, and the German vessels remained there while their fates were determined at the Potsdam Conference. The Allies eventually decided to award Nürnberg to the Soviet Union. To prevent the Germans from scuttling their ships as they had done in 1919, the Allies formally seized the vessels on 19 December, while Nürnberg was in drydock. That day, the ship's Soviet crew came aboard. On 2 January, the Soviets took their seized warships, which also included the target ship , Hessens <b>radio-control</b> vessel Blitz, the destroyer Z15 Erich Steinbrinck, and the torpedo boats T33 and T107, to Libau in present-day Latvia.|$|E

2500|$|In 1894, {{the first}} example of {{wirelessly}} controlling at a distance was during a demonstration by the British physicist Oliver Lodge, in which he made use of a Branly's coherer to make a mirror galvanometer move {{a beam of light}} when an electromagnetic wave was artificially generated.

50|$|STUNT TRAX - The goal of {{this mode}} is to drive {{all the way through}} each course as fast as {{possible}} while touching every star in sight to make a perfect score. There are four courses exclusive in this mode: Ice Dance, Blue Lake, Rock Field and Up'n Down. There are four Areas and three gates per course. When driven through a gate, the gate will close, making the player unable to reenter the previous Areas already passed through. A Special Course called Radio Control can be unlocked after the other four courses have been cleared. Unlike the other four courses, Radio Control doesn't have any stars nor gates, which it is actually a destruction derby course with the style of <b>radio-controlling.</b> The goal in this course is to run the vehicle the player is controlling into every other vehicle to destroy them.|$|R

50|$|Distributed {{power was}} {{originally}} {{able to be}} provided at only one intermediate location within a train. These forerunner systems (Locotrol 102-105 and Locotrol II) required a radio-relay car to be attached via standard multiple-unit jumper cabling to the remote locomotive(s) to provide the <b>radio-control</b> commands and facilitate feedback signals. Later, Locotrol II evolved into the 'Universal' {{system in which the}} <b>radio-control</b> equipment was installed on the locomotives themselves, rendering the relay car (variously referred-to as an 'RCU' for remote control unit or 'LRC' for locomotive remote control) redundant.|$|E
5000|$|Principally {{known as}} Fast Gun by its members due to few {{restrictions}} on rate of fire, this format is sometimes also identified as Small Gun {{because of its}} exclusive use of [...]177" [...] (BB) caliber guns.

40|$|In recent years, many {{research}} studies {{have pointed out}} that modelling environments, based on Information Technology, can supply effective pedagogical strategies dealing with complex real-world systems and everyday problem solutions. At the same time, physics teachers have discovered that video analysis is a relatively inexpensive and 188 worthwhile method of studying «real world» examples of phenomena. This kind of approach is often adopted to analyze sports physics. The study of physics of aircraft flight can be considered a real-world topic belonging to the everyone’s common experience. For this reason, here, we use a video-analysis software in order to measure the main dynamic variables, like speed and pitch, describing the longitudinal behaviour of a radio-controlled model aircraft during the take-off, cruise and landing. These experimental results are compared with the theoretical steady-state configurations obtained by using the phugoid model for longitudinal flight. According to this model, the airplane is considered as a point mass subjected to four forces (weight, lift, propulsive thrust and drag), being the direction of all the forces in the model, except weight, dependent on pitch. The discussion is also carried out by showing the trajectories of the aircraft in the phase space. The most relevant effects on the model aircraft flight caused by actions on the <b>radio-controls</b> are examined and explained in terms of aircraft parameter variation. From a pedagogical point of view, this kind of tool can be used to build up several inquiry-based proposals aimed at making students aware of the reasoning procedures to describe, formalise and explain the behaviour of some real systems as the airplanes...|$|R
