50|$|The factor {{replication}} method {{attempts to}} replicate the return stream of the hedge fund universe. The simplest way of doing this is by carrying out a linear regression, {{using one of the}} headline hedge fund indices and a number of factors. The model selects the factors that have the highest explanatory powers for the index returns, and then each month the model will perform the regression analysis over a rolling time frame, and select the weightings for each of these factors. This method is backward looking and may miss inflection points in the market as it relies on a <b>rolling</b> <b>window</b> of returns. Improvements to this method have been suggested, such as using Kalman or Particle filters, which improve the speed at which the model reacts to change.|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} from an {{extensive}} {{study on the}} benefits of <b>rolling</b> <b>window</b> and model averaging. Building on the recent work on <b>rolling</b> <b>window</b> averaging by Pesaran et al (2010, 2009) and on exchange rate forecasting by Molodtsova and Papell (2009), we explore whether <b>rolling</b> <b>window</b> averaging can be considered beneficial on a priori grounds, that is whether researchers can use it to improve forecasting performance and to avoid ‘window mining’ in short horizons. In addition, we investigate whether <b>rolling</b> <b>window</b> averaging can improve the performance of model averaging, especially when ‘simpler’ models are being used. Our results provide strong support for <b>rolling</b> <b>window</b> averaging, outperforming the best window forecasts more than 50 % of the time across all rolling windows considered – with the outperformance being statistically significant. Furthermore, <b>rolling</b> <b>window</b> averaging smoothes out the forecast path and improves robustness of the forecasting model, thus minimizing the pitfalls associated with potential structural breaks. An illustrative simulation supports the proposed improvement with the double averaging approach. Afterwards the technique is applied in three datasets: exchange rates for 12 OECD countries, US inflation rate and US output growth rate. For exchange rates, we use the dataset of Molodtsova and Papell (2009) and replicate their analysis by considering <b>rolling</b> <b>window</b> and model averaging. The results reveal <b>rolling</b> <b>window</b> averaging can further improve the performance of the models and, in addition, when combined with model averaging brings forth the forecasting ability of ‘simpler’ economic models of exchange rates. With respect to US inflation and output growth forecasting, we again find that <b>rolling</b> <b>window</b> averaging outperforms the best individual window forecasts by more than 50 % of the time, with significant differences from the benchmarks, and helps in model averaging by bringing forth the predictive power of economic variables in parsimonious models. ...|$|E

We compare the <b>rolling</b> <b>window</b> approach to estimation by smoothing methods. The main difference between the <b>rolling</b> <b>window</b> and the smoothing methods is in the way information is weighted. We propose that the Kalman filter smoother is the most appropriate estimator for the task as it optimally weights current and past information. We show the <b>rolling</b> <b>window</b> approach does not produce estimates that are attenuated over time leading to chain drift in the index. We also compare two alternative specifications to model property location. The empirical section uses data from a small and homogeneous market {{in the state of}} Queensland, Australia. The Tornqvist and Jevons indexes differ in value during periods of market volatility. This seems expected given their different weighting of transactions and the likelihood that price movements of properties at the upper and lower end of the price distribution might differ during periods of market volatility...|$|E

We doubt these results might be misleading due to instability in our VAR model and these motivate us to use the bootstrap <b>rolling</b> <b>window</b> estimation to investigate the export and economic growth nexus which accounts for the time varying causal link between these two variables.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} assumptions in empirical modeling is the constancy of the statistical model parameters which usually reflects the stationarity of the underlying stochastic process. In the 1980 s and 1990 s, the issue of nonstationarity in economic time series has been discussed in the context of unit roots vs. mean trends in AR(p) models. This perspective was subsequently extended to include structural breaks. In this article we take a much broader perspective by allowing for more general forms of nonstationarity. The focus of the article is primarily on misspecification testing. The proposed test relies on Maximum Entropy (ME) resampling techniques to enhance the information in the data in an attempt to capture heterogeneity “locally” using <b>rolling</b> <b>window</b> estimators.

The importance of inflation persistence {{is crucial to}} policy authorities and market participants, since the level of inflation persistence provides an indication on the susceptibility of the economy to exogenous shocks.

We find that for sufficiently large window lengths these distributions fit well to power-law behavior. We also measure the predictability itself by a hit rate, i. e. the rate of consistency between the signs of the actual returns and their predictions, obtained from a simple correlation-based predictor. It is found that during these relatively brief periods the returns are predictable to a certain degree and the predictability depends on the selection of the window length.
