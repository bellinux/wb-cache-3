50|$|These {{conditions}} {{indicate that}} the nose contour must meet the local <b>radial</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> and have a sufficient radius of curvature to allow the flow to follow the shape smoothly and efficiently until it is flowing parallel to the main air stream; and {{the shape of the}} inside of the cowling or of anything located inside the nose of the cowling is unimportant, for the velocity is low in thisregion. The shape of the inside of the nose being unimportant; the only necessary dimensions for the nose section design are for the outside contour. Well-designed nose sections must therefore have a change in angular direction of approximately 90°. Thecurvature is determined by the length in which this angular change takes place and is governed by the distance between the engine rocker boxes and the trailing edge of the propeller. The two designs given in figure 2 are the best contours for their particular dimensions and cover the normal variation of length as encountered in practice. Either design may be used with almost identical results at speeds below 350 miles per hour. Above that speed, nose 1 is recommended, as the maximum local velocity produced by this cowling is less than that for nose 2 and, if the local velocities exceed the velocity of sound, the drag of the cowling will be multiplied many times.|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThe main {{contribution}} {{of this work}} is to answer several important questions relating to natural draft wet cooling tower (NDWCT) modelling, design and optimisation. Specifically, the work aims to conduct {{a detailed analysis of}} the heat and mass transfer processes in a NDWCT, to determine how significant the radial non-uniformity of heat and mass transfer across a NDWCT is, what the underlying causes of the non-uniformity are and how these influence tower performance. Secondly, the work aims to determine what are the consequences of this non-uniformity for the traditional one dimensional design methods, which neglect any two-dimensional air flow or heat transfer effects. Finally, in the context of radial non-uniformity of heat and mass transfer, this work aims to determine the optimal arrangement of fill depth and water distribution across a NDWCT and to quantify the improvement in tower performance using this non-uniform distribution. To this end, an axisymmetric numerical model of a NDWCT has been developed. A study was conducted testing the influence of key design and operating parameters. The results show that in most cases the air flow is quite uniform across the tower due to the significant flow restriction through the fill and spray zone regions. There can be considerable radial non-uniformity of heat transfer and water outlet temperature in spite of this. This is largely due to the cooling load in the rain zone and the <b>radial</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> there. High radial non-uniformity of heat transfer can be expected when the cooling load in the rain zone is high. Such a situation can arise with small droplet sizes, low fill depths, high water flow rates. The results show that the effect of tower inlet height on radial non-uniformity is surprisingly very small. Of the parameters considered the water mass flow rate and droplet size and droplet distribution in the rain zone have the most influence on radial noniv uniformity of heat transfer. The predictions of the axisymmetric numerical model have been compared with a one dimensional NDWCT model. The difference between the predictions of tower cooling range is very low, generally around 1 - 2 %. This extraordinarily close comparison supports the assumptions of one dimensional flow and bulk averaged heat transfer implicit in these models. Under the range of parameters tested here the difference between the CFD models predictions and those of the one dimensional models remained fairly constant suggesting that there is no particular area where the flow/heat transfer becomes so skewed or non-uniform that the one dimensional model predictions begin to fail. An extended one dimensional model, with semi-two dimensional capability, has been developed for use with an evolutionary optimisation algorithm. The two dimensional characteristics are represented through a radial profile of the air enthalpy at the fill inlet which has been derived from the CFD results. The resulting optimal shape redistributes the fill volume from the tower centre to the outer regions near the tower inlet. The water flow rate is also increased here as expected, to balance the cooling load across the tower, making use of the cooler air near the inlet. The improvement {{has been shown to be}} very small however. The work demonstrates that, contrary to common belief, the potential improvement from multi-dimensional optimisation is actually quite small...|$|E

40|$|Current {{interruption}} is {{a complex}} process, and optimizing {{the design of a}} medium voltage load-break switch is difficult. The dominating technology for load-break switches in medium voltage switchgear is using SF 6 as interruption medium. SF 6 is classified as a potent greenhouse gas with very high global warming potential. Thus, the industry has begun looking at other technologies. One interesting option is to quench the arc using air. When using air instead of SF 6, optimization with regard to size is important since larger equipment will not fit in many existing installation sites. Due to the superior properties of SF 6, little research has been done with air as an interrupting medium in load-break switches. The thesis addresses medium-voltage load current interruption in air. The project work has focused on determining how the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> should be designed to obtain the best interruption performance in a load-break switch. A simplified experimental setup based on steady-state <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> and with an electrically heated wolfram wire, simulating the arc, was used. Two different <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> designs were made and tested in the laboratory: axial and radial flow. With the axial design, the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> was blown straight on the wire. With the <b>radial</b> design, the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> was blown 90 ° onto the wire. Two different wire diameters for the simulated arc were tested to simulate the arc, 0. 15 and 0. 38 mm. The radial design proved to be 35 % more efficient with a starting temperature of 570 °C over the heated were. Laboratory experiments showed that the difference between the axial and radial design increased with temperature. With the radial design, a higher velocity of the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> was created towards the center of the nozzle. The results show the importance of the angle when <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> is blown on an arc. By heat distribution measurements, calculations of the convection loss over the heated wire during the cooling process were done. The convection loss increased with stepwise <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> and proved to be dependent on the <b>air</b> <b>flow.</b> The results verified the validation of the model. Hence, the convection loss can describe the efficiency of the cooling for the setup. Simulations in COMSOL Multiphysics proved to be a good comparison to the laboratory experiments and a deeper picture of the heat distribution was analyzed.

Para tanto, além das determinações das temperaturas e dos teores de água da massa, foi avaliado o desempenho fisiológico das sementes no início e ao final de seis meses de armazenamento. Apesar das vantagens físicas operacionais resultantes da combinação entre o fluxo e a temperatura intermediários (28, 4 m³/minuto/t e 46 ºC), a qualidade fisiológica foi menos prejudicada nas combinações dos menores fluxos (26, 9 e 28, 4 m³/minuto/t) com a maior temperatura (50 ºC) e do maior fluxo (33, 2 m³/minuto/t) com as menores temperaturas (42 e 46 ºC); entre estas, levando em conta os aspectos físico-operacionais, a associação de 28, 4 m³/minuto/t com 50 ºC foi a mais eficiente na retirada de água das sementes. Assim, admitindo os intervalos de fluxo (26, 9 a 33, 2 m³/minuto/t) e de temperatura (42 a 50 ºC) estudados, conclui-se que a elevação na temperatura demanda redução no fluxo e, inversamente, o aumento no fluxo demanda redução na temperatura.

Besides temperature and moisture content of seed mass, physiological seed quality was evaluated at the beginning and after a period of six months storage. Although the combination of the intermediates <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> and temperature (28. 4 m³/minute/ton and 46 ºC) had been physically advantageous, the seed quality was less impaired by the combinations of the smaller <b>air</b> <b>flows</b> (26. 9 and 28. 4 m³/minute/ton) with the highest temperature (50 ºC) and the highest <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> (33. 2 m³/minute/ton) with the smaller temperatures (42 and 46 ºC).

The cylindrical bag contains rings that prevent it from completely collapsing {{under the pressure of}} the air. A fan blows clean air in the reverse direction. The relaxation and reverse <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> cause the dust cake to crumble and release into the hopper. Upon the completion of the cleaning process, dirty <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> continues and the bag regains its shape.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate upon scleroglucan {{production}} in batch cultures of S. glucanicum NRRL 3006 cultivated in airlift reactor with internal loop was studied using <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates from 0. 25 m(3) /h to 1. 00 m(3) /h. Biomass formation was favoured at high <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates (with maximum biomass at 0. 75 m(3) /h), whilst scleroglucan synthesis was highest at relatively low <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates (maximal at 0. 40 m(3) /h). S. glucanicurn had a maximum specific {{growth rate of}} 0. 018 h(- 1) at 0. 75 m(3) /h. The values of the key process optimisation parameters (scleroglucan yield, productivity and specific productivity) were all maximal at 0. 4 m(3) /h. Since achievement of an adequate cell mass is essential for subsequent biopolymer synthesis, a bi-staged process was developed. In the first phase biomass formation was maximised by a high <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate of 0. 75 m(3) /h, while {{in the second phase}} a lower <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate of 0. 40 m(3) /h was used to stimulate biopolymer synthesis and minimise operational costs. The effect of <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate upon scleroglucan production in batch cultures of S. glucanicum NRRL 3006 cultivated in airlift reactor with internal loop was studied using <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates from 0. 25 m(3) /h to 1. 00 m(3) /h.

40|$|Abstract: The {{influences}} of operating parameters (bed height, <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate, and separation time) on the separation effect for lump coal were experimentally studied. The {{results show that}} shallow bed takes less time to reach steady separation state comparing with the deep bed. Increasing separation time at low <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate and decreasing separation time at high <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate could improve the separation effect. Separation effect could get the optimal under the condensation of bed height at 90 mm, <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate at 8 m 3 /h and separation time at 60 s...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} on the special characteristics of the professional singing voice has at least partially explained how singers can commonly use much higher lung pressures than nonsingers without vocal damage or excessive <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> during the voiced sounds. In this study, the control of <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> during the unvoiced consonants is examined for an operatic-style soprano. It was found that this singer could maintain a low average <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> during the consonants even though the lung pressure reached values over five times those used during normal conversational speech. The <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> was kept low primarily {{by the use of}} a number of mechanisms involving rapid, accurate, coordinated valving of the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> at the point of articulation and at the glottis...|$|R

30|$|The {{additional}} LAF screen used in {{the study}} (Toul- 400, Toul Meditech, Vasteras, Sweden) is a mobile unit that produces ultraclean exponential laminar <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> in a predefined area (the wound in our case). The additional mobile unit is a box with a fan and a HEPA filter (CAMFIL type, 99.997 % particles > 0.3  μm). The screen produces a laminar <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> of 0.5 – 0.7  m/s onto the wound and 0.4  m/s at the periphery. This exponential <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> prevents the entrainment of OR air outside the LAF [7, 8]. This <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> is turbulence-free and not impeded by the movements of the surgical team in the defined <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> area. The existing regular ventilation system does not affect the functioning of the unit. A camera assists in determining the direction of <b>air</b> <b>flow,</b> and an integrated sensor determines the correct distance from the surgical site for maximum effect. An integrated display allows the user to easily check and verify the setup (Toul Meditech data).|$|R
