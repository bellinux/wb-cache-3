50|$|There {{have been}} a number of cases that have come before the Constitutional Court {{requiring}} it to interpret and apply the rights and principles in the Constitution pertaining to ACL. In doing so, the CC has not only been faced with the challenge of elucidating the extent to which ACL is now recognised, but it has also had to address the issue of how to go about ascertaining what that law in fact is. The first such substantive case is Alexkor Ltd and Another v the Richtersveld Community and Others, which involved the appeal of a claim for <b>restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> by the Richtersveld Community ('the Community'), an indigenous South African community, in terms of the <b>Restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Land</b> Rights Act. The Constitutional Court therefore had to examine whether or not the Community had rights in land in 1913 and, if so, whether or not it was subsequently dispossessed 'as a result of past racially discriminatory laws or practices.' It was in answering the first of these questions that the Court made various authoritative comments regarding the extent to which ACL is now recognised.|$|E

50|$|The Land Claims Court of the Republic of South Africa was {{established}} in 1995 and has the same status as the High Courts of that country. The court specializes in hearing disputes that arise out of laws that underpin South Africa's land reform initiative.

40|$|Restitution {{has to be}} made in {{a highly}} {{political}} environment, making the planning and design <b>of</b> <b>restitution</b> programmes in rural, peri-urban and urban areas extremely complex. The development of governance structures for restitution programmes is influenced by policy instruments that have to consider taxation effects and their impact on economic behaviour, as well as predict outcomes that transcend the objective functions. The complexity is exacerbated by limited scientific evidence and the absence of evidence-based policy-making, culminating in policy neglect and inadequate service delivery outcomes for land reform and restitution. The article explores progress made with the implementation <b>of</b> the Nkumbuleni <b>Land</b> Claim (Kwa-Zulu Natal) and examines what prevents the restitution support programme from implementing its policy objectives (guided by the <b>Restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lands</b> Rights Act, Act 22 of 1994). The authors conclude that the attainment of sustainable outcomes in post-settlement restitution support continues to be a challenge to policy-makers, as claims remain unsustainable. Poor communication between stakeholders, the narrow role municipalities play in restitution and conflicting governance structures between “traditional councils versus municipal councils” are seen as the main drivers of programme failure...|$|R

The following year, in Shoprite v MEC, Eastern Cape, which dealt comprehensively with the meaning of the constitutional right to property, Moseneke's judgment attracted the most concurrences.Most celebrated is Moseneke's judgment in Glenister v President, co-authored with Justice Edwin Cameron, which struck down amendments to the National Prosecuting Act and South African Police Service Act on the basis that they failed to create an [...] "adequately independent" [...] anti-corruption unit. This was hailed as an [...] "imaginative" [...] and [...] "brilliant" [...] judgment by commentators and means South Africa must have an independent corruption-fighting agency notwithstanding the ruling ANC's controversial disbanding of the Scorpions.|$|E
5000|$|In 1994, {{the newly}} elected African National Congress began to develop a program of land reform. This {{includes}} three primary means of reform: redistribution, restitution, and land tenure reform. [...] Redistribution aims to transfer white-owned commercial farms to black Africans. [...] Restitution involves giving compensation to land lost to whites due to apartheid, racism, and discrimination. [...] Land tenure reform strives to provide more secure access to land. [...] Several laws have been enacted to facilitate redistribution, restitution, and land tenure reform. The Provision of Certain Land of Settlement Act of 1996 designates land for settlement purposes and ensures financial assistance to those seeking to acquire land. [...] The <b>Restitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>Land</b> Rights Act of 1994 guided the implementation of restitution {{and gave it a}} legal basis. [...] The Extension of Security of Tenure Act of 1996 helps rural populations obtain stronger rights to their land and regulates the relationships between owners of rural land and those living on it. [...] So far, these land-reform measures have been semi-effective. By 1998, over 250,000 black South Africans received land {{as a result of the}} Land Redistribution Programme. [...] Very few restitution claims have been resolved. [...] In the five years after the land reform programs were instituted, only 1% of land changed hands, despite the African National Congress’s goal of 30%.|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} there are social spaces in Peru where {{alternative}} memories about the political violence that took place between 1980 and 2000 are produced. In Andahuaylas, Apurímac, recurrent narratives tell about servitude in the hacienda, peasant mobilization for the <b>restitution</b> <b>of</b> their <b>land,</b> land occupation and its violent repression. A victorious memory <b>of</b> the <b>land</b> occupation exists alongside of an oppressive memory of internal war.  Yet these representations have been silenced by official studies on memory, which are now so fashionable. In Ongoy, Andahuaylas, {{in the guise of}} a conflict between communities and hacienda, there are peasant’s political practices in relation with respect to the state. Peasants developed association networks with state institutions, trade unions, students, migrants, political parties and others to seek the <b>restitution</b> <b>of</b> their <b>land.</b> They gathered documents which they use in support of their memory and seniority in the territory. These show that the struggle for land that culminated in  1963 with the occupation <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> the slaughter <b>of</b> peasants and repression, has colonial origins.  These are stories and memories that reconstruct the land struggle as a heroic act and overlap with other more recent representations of political violence. To analyze the process, events in Ongoy between 1960 and 1969 are reconstructed in dialog with the peasants gathered documents and testimonies of the actors on how events are reinterpreted after political violence...|$|R
