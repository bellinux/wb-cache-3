5|$|Bristol in {{the early}} 1960s had an {{estimated}} 3,000 residents of West Indian origin, some who {{had served in the}} British military during World War II and some who had emigrated to Britain more recently.

This community set up their own churches and associations, including the West Indian Association, which began to act as a <b>representative</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
5|$|By definition, modern {{democratic}} constitutional monarchies are parliamentary, {{as there}} is no elected head of state who could assume non-ceremonial competences; of the twenty one republican member states of the European Union, only one is a presidential republic (Cyprus) and five are semi-presidential republics (France, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Romania). These six (semi-)presidential republics elect their president by direct popular vote. Among the fourteen parliamentary republics, half do the same (namely Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, Slovakia and Slovenia), whereas in the remaining seven (Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia and Malta), the president is elected by parliament or other special <b>representative</b> <b>body</b> such as the German Bundesversammlung.|$|E
5|$|Iran is {{regarded}} by the United Nations and other non-governmental organizations {{as among the}} world's worst offenders against freedom of religion â€” alongside Saudi Arabia and Sudan. Members of religious minorities are, by law and practice, barred from being elected to a <b>representative</b> <b>body</b> (except to {{the seats in the}} Majles reserved for minorities, as provided for in the Constitution) and from holding senior government or military positions. They also suffer discrimination in the legal system, receiving lower awards in injury and death lawsuits, and incurring heavier punishments, than Muslims. Muslim men are free to marry non-Muslim women but marriages between Muslim women and non-Muslim men are not recognized.|$|E

5|$|So {{long as we}} exclude one community, {{we cannot}} as a {{political}} {{speak on behalf of}} or claim to represent all the people of our presidency. If, as we hope, provincial autonomy is given to the provinces {{as a result of the}} reforms that may be granted, it should be essential that our Federation should be in a position to claim to be a truly <b>representative</b> <b>body</b> of all communities. What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are willing to subscribe to the aims and objects of our Federation? It may be that the Brahmins may not join even if the ban is removed. But surely our Federation will not thereafter be open to objection on the ground that it is an exclusive organisation.|$|E
5|$|The AFM's {{national}} <b>representative</b> <b>body</b> is the triennial General Business Meeting. Its {{main function}} is {{the election of}} the national officers: president, deputy president, general secretary and general treasurer.

Additional voting members are members of the National Leadership Forum, members of standing committees, one additional member representing each church department and one additional representative of the church's theological training institutions. Before 2000, the General Business Meeting was known as the Workers Council, met annually, and possessed greater power. After the adoption of the new constitution, most of the body's power was transferred to the National Leadership Forum.|$|E
