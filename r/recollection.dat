5|$|During the Reformation, Martin Luther {{rejected}} {{many of the}} Catholic Church's seven sacraments, but retained baptism and the Lord's Supper. He {{saw many}} practices of the medieval church as abuses of power intended to require work in order to merit forgiveness for sin after baptism rather than faith alone. Luther attached the promise of salvation to baptism, and taught that life after baptism should be spent in <b>recollection</b> {{of it and the}} dying to sin it signified.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS—The <b>recollections</b> of {{critically}} ill children following {{discharge from the}} paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) have not previously been described. We have interviewed such children to establish {{the nature of their}} <b>recollections.</b>  METHODS—Children aged 4 years and above were interviewed following discharge from the PICU at the Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham, either in hospital or at home, using a semistructured interview. Their <b>recollections</b> were recorded and interpreted by content analysis.  RESULTS—A total of 38 interviews were carried out; 44 specific <b>recollections</b> were reported, the majority being neutral (60 %) or positive (25 %). Only 15 % of <b>recollections</b> were negative. Negative <b>recollections</b> related to aspects of medical care and environmental factors. No child treated with neuromuscular blocking agents remembered any period of therapeutic paralysis.  CONCLUSIONS—Children's <b>recollections</b> of PICU are mainly neutral or positive. Mechanically ventilated children sedated with midazolam and morphine remember little of endotracheal intubation. ...|$|R
5|$|A notable machinima {{production}} is the comedy series Red vs. Blue created by Rooster Teeth Productions. It has achieved an unparalleled {{level of success}} in Halo machinima in specific, and machinima in general; it is credited with bringing attention to the genre. Red vs. Blue generated annual revenues of US$200,000, and special promotional episodes were commissioned by Bungie. The first series, The Blood Gulch Chronicles, ended on June 28, 2007, after 100 regular episodes and numerous promotional videos. Subsequent series include The <b>Recollection,</b> which contains more dramatic elements than its comedic predecessor, Project Freelancer, The Chorus Trilogy, and Anthology, the most recent series. Other machinima series include Fire Team Charlie, The Codex, and the in-game interview show This Spartan Life.|$|E
5|$|A short interregnum followed, {{during which}} {{ownership}} {{was transferred to}} J.W. Skaggs. Skaggs continued to push Alexander's Democratic Party/states' rights agenda during his short five weeks at the helm. The poor economics of the weekly paper were unchanged, however, and Skaggs immediately moved to unload his newly acquired white elephant. He cut his losses and avoided the stigma of financial failure for himself and the conservative political movement by giving away the paper outright to two men who worked for him as printers, William Thompson and William Victor. According to Thompson's later <b>recollection,</b> Skaggs sweetened the transfer of ownership by tossing in two bundles of paper and two cords of firewood for the new owners.|$|E
5|$|By {{the nineteenth}} century, Jannon's {{matrices}} {{had come to}} be known as the Caractères de l'Université (Characters of the University). It has sometimes been claimed that this term was an official name designated for the Jannon type by Cardinal Richelieu, while Warde in 1926 more plausibly suggested it might be a garbled <b>recollection</b> of Jannon's work with the Sedan Academy, which operated much like a university despite not using the name. Carter in the 1970s followed this conclusion. Mosley, however, concludes that no report of the term (or much use of Jannon's matrices at all) exists before the nineteenth century, and it may originate from a generic term of the eighteenth century simply meaning older or more conservative typeface designs, perhaps those preferred in academic publishing.|$|E

5|$|Despite her {{relative}} inexperience, Leigh {{was chosen}} to play Ophelia to Olivier's Hamlet in an Old Vic Theatre production staged at Elsinore, Denmark. Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly changed as she was preparing to go onstage. Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him before suddenly becoming silent and staring into space. She was able to perform without mishap, and by the following day she had returned to normal with no <b>recollection</b> of the event. It {{was the first time}} Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her. They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce. Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.|$|E
5|$|Edward Drinker Cope {{was born}} on July 28, 1840, the eldest son of Alfred and Hanna Cope. The death of his mother when he {{was three years old}} seemed to have had little effect on young Edward, as he {{mentioned}} in his letters that he had no <b>recollection</b> of her. His stepmother, Rebecca Biddle, filled the maternal role; Cope referred to her warmly, as well as his younger stepbrother, James Biddle Cope. Alfred, an orthodox member of the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers, operated a lucrative shipping business started by his father, Thomas P. Cope, in 1821. He was a philanthropist who gave money to the Society of Friends, the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens, and the Institute for Colored Youth.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the Cosmic Owl joins Prismo and Jake, {{and the two}} chat in a hot tub. While {{reaching}} for chips, the Cosmic Owl unmutes the TV, and Jake realizes that Finn is in trouble. Prismo explains that Jake can still save Finn by using his wish, but reveals that his wish must be very specific, as Prismo's wishes {{have a tendency to}} have a monkey's paw—an ironic twist—connected to them. After coaching by Prismo, Jake wishes that the Lich's original wish had been for Finn and Jake to return home. Prismo grants the wish, and Finn and Jake are indeed transported back to Ooo. Finn has no <b>recollection</b> of his time in the alternate reality, but Jake does.|$|E

5|$|Harrison {{discussed}} the song at length in a 1987 interview for Musician magazine, {{during which he}} recalls that his mother developed a brain tumour late in 1969 but then recovered for seven months. After hearing of the initial diagnosis in September 1969, Harrison cancelled a recording session with Apple Records artist Jackie Lomax to see her; author Peter Doggett comments that, because {{of the severity of}} this news, Harrison would later have no <b>recollection</b> of how he heard of John Lennon's decision to leave the Beatles, on 20 September.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 Hata {{argued that}} the {{recently}} released monologue of Emperor Hirohito, the former Emperor's <b>recollection</b> of wartime Japan which he recorded shortly after World War II, had likely been created {{to prove to the}} United States that he was not involved in war crimes and consequently Hata theorized that an English language translation must have also been drawn up at the same time, a theory which was mocked by right-wing scholars who felt the monologue was created as a simple historical record without ulterior motives. In 1997 the English language draft was discovered.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Romney {{revealed}} {{a change of}} view regarding abortion, moving from the pro-choice positions expressed during his 1994 and 2002 campaigns to a pro-life one in opposition to Roe v.

Romney attributed his conversion to an interaction with Harvard University biologist Douglas Melton, an expert on embryonic stem cell biology, although Melton vehemently disputed Romney's <b>recollection</b> of their conversation. Romney subsequently vetoed a bill on pro-life grounds that expanded access to emergency contraception in hospitals and pharmacies (the legislature overrode the veto). He also amended his position on {{embryonic stem cell research}} itself.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} whether self-criticism and depressive symptoms mediate {{the relationship between}} <b>recollections</b> of parental rejection and suicidality. A community sample of 200 Portuguese adults completed, in counterbalanced order, a socio-demographic questionnaire, the short form of the Inventory for Assessing Memories of Parental Rearing Behaviour (EMBU), the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and reports of any suicide intention and=or ideation and suicide attempts. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) indicated that <b>recollections</b> of parental rejection are significantly associated with depressive symptoms and suicidality. <b>Recollections</b> of parental rejection are indirectly associated with depressive symptoms and suicidality through self-criticism. The association between self-criticism and suicidality is mediated by depressive symptoms. In addition to a significant direct association between <b>recollections</b> of parental rejection and suicidality, the final model indicated that <b>recollections</b> of parental rejection are significantly associated with self-criticism. That same self-criticism is significantly associated with depressive symptoms which, in turn, are significantly associated with suicidality. Individuals with <b>recollections</b> of parental rejection {{are at greater risk}} for suicide ideation and behavior, possibly because such experiences predispose them to intense self-criticism which is a risk factor for depression associated with suicidal ideation and behavior...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Martha Dickinson Bianchi and Millicent Todd Bingham kept the {{achievement}} of Emily Dickinson alive. Bianchi promoted Dickinson's poetic achievement. Bianchi inherited The Evergreens {{as well as the}} copyright for her aunt's poetry from her parents, publishing works such as Emily Dickinson Face to Face and Letters of Emily Dickinson, which stoked public curiosity about her aunt. Bianchi's books perpetrated legends about her aunt in the context of family tradition, personal <b>recollection</b> and correspondence. In contrast, Millicent Todd Bingham's took a more objective and realistic approach to the poet.|$|E
5|$|One month later, former Wisteria Lane {{resident}} Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) {{moves back}} to the neighborhood after twelve years of absence with her husband, Adam (Nathan Fillion), and teenage daughter, Dylan (Lyndsy Fonseca).

Susan's daughter, Julie (Andrea Bowen), is puzzled to learn that Dylan has no <b>recollection</b> of their childhood friendship or of her life on Wisteria Lane.
