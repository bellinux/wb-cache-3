5|$|Brownlee's {{work as an}} MLA {{extended}} beyond the legislature. He gave close attention to correspondence from his constituents, especially those alleging improper treatment at Ponoka's psychiatric hospital. He prepared thoroughly for speaking engagements in his riding, trying to anticipate all possible questions. These measures were <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> support in the largely rural riding, where the Calgary lawyer became a popular and well-respected MLA.|$|E
5|$|Drake {{suffered}} from major depression, {{and this was}} often <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lyrics. On completion of his third album, 1972's Pink Moon, he withdrew from both live performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. On 25 November 1974, {{at the age of}} 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined to be suicide.|$|E
5|$|Saint-Saëns wrote a one-act ballet, Javot (1896), {{the score}} for the film L'assassinat du duc de Guise (1908), and {{incidental}} music to a dozen plays between 1850 and 1916. Three of these scores were for revivals of classics by Molière and Racine, for which Saint-Saëns's deep knowledge of French baroque scores was <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> scores, in which he incorporated music by Lully and Charpentier.|$|E

50|$|Möllberg started {{performing}} {{when he was}} 18 years old. Later he met the 12 {{years older}} musician Lasse Lundberg who influenced him to a music style which he would <b>reflect</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> works <b>in</b> the future.|$|R
50|$|He {{published}} his first collection of Urdu poetry in 1969. Childhood imagery persistently <b>reflects</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> poetry as elements of nostalgia. Primary themes which run through his poetry are contradictions in life, {{the search for}} purpose, nuances of human relationships, differences between practice and preaching, and the groping for that which is lost.|$|R
5|$|The {{moment he}} starts to speak, not at the lectern, but walking around it on cat's paws, he is simply enchanting. In the Middle Ages, this man would have been sent into exile. He is not only eloquent, he also keeps his {{listeners}} spellbound by his sparking personality, <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> small, dark eyes.|$|E
5|$|The novelist Vladimir Nabokov {{was the son}} of a {{professional}} lepidopterist, and was interested in butterflies himself. He wrote his novel Lolita while travelling on his annual butterfly-collection trips in the western United States. He eventually became a leading lepidopterist. This is <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> fiction, where for example The Gift devotes two whole chapters (of five) to the tale of a father and son on a butterfly expedition.|$|E
5|$|Adkins grew up {{in poverty}} {{in the midst of}} the Depression, and his spirited, unusual {{lifestyle}} is <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> music. His songs, which he began recording and distributing locally in the mid-1950s, explored an affinity for sexual intercourse, and decapitation, and were obscure outside of West Virginia until the 1980s. The newfound popularity secured him a cult following, spawned the Norton Records label, and helped usher in the genre known as psychobilly.|$|E
50|$|Vijay Koparkar {{has been}} trained by gurus {{belonging}} to different gharanas (schools of music), and it <b>reflects</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> singing. He has received several honors including a scholarship given by Master Sudhir Phadke Through ‘Surashree Pratishthan’ {{for six years}} from 1983 to 1990 and the ‘Pandit Ramkrishna Vaze Puraskar’ by Gandharva Mahamandal.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, Sabzi made {{realistic}} paintings {{inspired by}} his country's history and culture. He went to exile during the regime of Ruhollah Khomeini, settling in Germany and the United States. During this period, he experimented with figurative and abstract styles. [...] He eventually settled in southern California. Each of <b>his</b> moves was <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> changes <b>in</b> <b>his</b> style to <b>reflect</b> changes <b>in</b> <b>his</b> environment.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> works, Jonas Lie often {{sought to}} <b>reflect</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{writings}} the nature, folk life, and social {{spirit of the}} nation of Norway. His writing often dealt with family life in diverse settings, including portraying the social and intellectual restrictions on women of the educated classes. Lie was a versatile writer, liberal and modern, but also strongly tradition bound.|$|R
5|$|He {{was given}} to {{sketching}} and drawing from an early age, without encouragement from his family. However, when he turned sixteen and {{wanted to go to}} Stockholm to study art, they were enthusiastic for him and backed him financially. In 1898, {{he was one of the}} 40 applicants to study at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts, and although he was deemed well qualified for a place at the academy, he was too young to be accepted. He spent the next two years at the Kaleb Ahltins school for painters. During this time he was, like most teenagers, torn between hope and despair, something that is <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> artwork.|$|E
5|$|Seale {{suggests}} that Abu Nidal's childhood explained his personality, described as chaotic by Abu Iyad and as psychopathic by Issam Sartawi, the late Palestinian heart surgeon. His siblings' scorn, {{the loss of}} his father and his mother's removal from the family home when he was seven, then {{the loss of his}} home and status in the conflict with Israel, created a mental world of plots and counterplots, <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> tyrannical leadership of the ANO. Members' wives (it was an all-male group) were not allowed to befriend each another, and Abu Nidal's wife was expected to live in isolation without friends.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh's gaze {{is seldom}} {{directed}} at the viewer. The portraits vary in intensity and colour, and in those painted after December 1888 especially, the vivid colours highlight the haggard pallor of his skin. Some depict the artist with a beard, others without. He can be seen with bandages in portraits executed just after he mutilated his ear. In only a few does he depict himself as a painter. Those painted in Saint-Rémy show the head from the right, the side opposite his damaged ear, as he painted himself <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mirror.|$|E
50|$|Jack met his wife, Judy, {{while they}} were both {{attending}} Ohio State University. They have three children, Amy, Dan, and Josh, and two grandchildren, Andrew and Emily.

"The {{marginal}} {{person is}} poised in the psychological uncertainty between two (or more) social worlds; <b>reflecting</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> soul the discords and harmonies, repulsions and attractions of these worlds...within which membership is implicitly if not explicitly based upon birth or ancestry...and where exclusion removes the individual from {{a system of}} group relations."

5|$|Harley's {{leadership}} {{qualities and}} {{influence on the}} club as captain was commended {{early on in the}} season after his handling of teammate Steve Johnson's off-field discretions. Johnson was banished from the team during the pre-season and demoted to the reserves for the first five games of the season. However, he successfully returned to the team and finished the season as a Norm Smith Medallist and All-Australian. Harley's leadership influence on the team was <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> finishing fourth in the AFLPA Best Captain award during his first year at the helm. He was also awarded life membership of the Geelong Football Club following his 150th team appearance in the round sixteen win against the Western Bulldogs, and named in the end-of-season South Australian State of Origin team.|$|E
5|$|In 2002–03, Parker {{played in}} all 82 regular-season games as San Antonio's {{starting}} point guard {{on a team}} that was largely revamped from previous years. He improved his regular season statistics, averaging 15.5 points per game (ppg), 5.3 assists per game (apg) and 2.6 rebounds per game (rpg). Parker's role as the team's playmaker was <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> leading the team in assists on 49 occasions. During the 2003 NBA All-Star Weekend, Parker represented the Sophomores in the Got Milk? Rookie Challenge, and also participated in the inaugural 989 Sports Skills Challenge. In the post season, the Spurs, led by Tim Duncan, defeated the New Jersey Nets 4–2 in the finals, and Parker earned his first NBA championship ring. Despite the victory, Parker struggled with inconsistent play throughout the playoffs, and was often substituted for the more experienced guards Steve Kerr and Speedy Claxton late in the games.|$|E
5|$|In his youth, Stojanović wrote poems, {{only one}} of which is published—in a 1918 issue of the {{literary}} magazine Književni jug, whose editor was future Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić. For this poem, Stojanović was inspired by the Serbian epic hero Ailing Dojčin. A number of Stojanović's poems are preserved in a notebook that belonged to his closest school friend Todor Ilić. According to the poet Dragan Kolundžija, Stojanović's poems are lyrical miniatures composed in free verse, focused on man and nature, and filled with melancholy. Kolundžija finds that what inspired Stojanović to write poetry is <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> verse Krvav je bol (Pain is bloody). According to poet Miroslav Feldman, who first met Stojanović in 1919 in Zagreb, his poems were sad and permeated with a yearning for a brighter, more joyous life.|$|E

50|$|As a {{representative}} of the music life in Macedonia participates in various international projects, forums and organizations in Macedonia and abroad. He is typical neo-folklorist representative <b>in</b> Macedonia. <b>His</b> works are directly inspired by native folklore music tradition being genuine sample of autochthonous transformation of folklore idiom in various formal structures as chamber, orchestral, and vocal music works. This unique composing style <b>reflects</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> active pedagogy activity.|$|R
5000|$|Two months afterwards, on 15 April 1838, Andries Pretorius <b>reflects</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> journal: [...] "As we were {{separated}} from one another, they succeeded in their attack at daybreak at Blaauwekrans, thereby killing 33 men, 75 women and 123 children." [...] This implies {{a total of}} 231 deaths at the Blaauwekrans camps. The name Blaauwekrans (Msuluzi) refers to bluish cliff faces present in the area.|$|R
5|$|Much of Colbert's {{personal}} life was <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> character on The Colbert Report. With the extended {{exposure of the}} character on the show, he often referenced his interest in and knowledge of Catholicism, science fiction, and The Lord of the Rings, as well as using real facts to create his character's history. His alternate persona was also raised in South Carolina, is the youngest of 11 siblings and is married. The actual Colbert's career history in acting and comedy, however, was often downplayed or even denied outright, and he frequently referred to having attended Dartmouth College (which was {{at the forefront of}} the conservative campus movement in the 1980s) rather than his actual alma mater, Northwestern. In July 2012, Colbert added two years to his contract with Comedy Central, extending the run of The Colbert Report until the end of 2014.|$|E
5|$|Aleph {{was created}} to embody the Shin Megami Tensei II world, which is <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{character}} design: he has a portable computer and a visor that he controls demons with, and carries swords, guns and armor for use in battle. His computer was designed to look compact, and the visor {{was designed to be}} wireless, to show that the game takes place in the future. Kaneko decided to not give Aleph a personality, partially because he is controlled by the player, and partially because he is portrayed as an artificial being, created by the Center's scientists. Beth and Daleth were designed to look similar to the first Shin Megami Tensei Heroine and Hero, using the colors blue and green, respectively. Lucifer was visually portrayed as an elegant gentleman, as Kaneko saw him as someone who tempts and tries the player, rather than being evil. He designed Lucifer in accordance with portrayals of him as a beautiful twelve-winged angel, but gave him six wings instead, for a total of twelve across his appearances in Shin Megami Tensei and Shin Megami Tensei II.|$|E
5|$|To gain further match experience, Messi joined Barcelona C in {{addition}} to the Juveniles A, playing his first game for the third team on 29 November. He helped save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera División, scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey match while man-marked by Sevilla's Sergio Ramos. His progress was <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first professional contract, signed on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30million. A month later, on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda División B, and his buyout clause automatically increased to €80million. He played five games with the B team that season but did not score. Physically he was weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength {{in order to be able}} to shake off defenders. Towards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the Juveniles B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.|$|E
5000|$|His novels {{represent}} one of {{the most}} authentic values of the Czech interwar prose. He was close with his humanistic credo to his generation fellows such as Karel Čapek and František Langer. At the same time he <b>reflects</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> [...] "humoristic" [...] (but only at the first sight) novel the deep tragedy of the petty bourgeois, small-town and suburban world in which hypocrisy, mental smallness, narrow-mindness and spiritual poverty wins.|$|R
5000|$|Later, when Burns resisted, {{negative}} {{press about}} him was planted in newspapers and, under the threat of legislation to dilute the Fed's influence, Burns and other Governors succumbed.

50|$|Earlier <b>in</b> <b>his</b> sumo career, Masunoyama had {{initially}} been advised {{by a doctor}} that he had heart disease and should {{be careful not to}} overstrain himself; this also appeared to <b>reflect</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> sumo, where after an initial spurt of energy at the tachi-ai he would collapse after around 20 seconds from exhaustion. Eventually however, the coach at his stable insisted on a second opinion and a thorough heart examination was conducted which found no evidence of a heart condition.|$|R
