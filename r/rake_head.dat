A long-tailed coat fell clean and full over his thighs; {{his back and}} {{shoulders}} were a wee bit bent to lessen motion, and above his neat white stock under a grey bowler hat his lean, grey-whiskered and moustachioed face, with harassed eyes, was preoccupied and sad.

50|$|Since 1350 Rudelsdorf {{had been}} known as a {{community}} with a church. Originally there was a wooden church {{in place of the}} present one. In the place of the present stairs used to stand the church tower which that time was separated from the bay. According to parish chronicle this ancient church contained Gothic paintings of the owner's heraldry. Coat of arms on them depicted bestial <b>heads,</b> <b>rake</b> and men belonging to three local Lords whose names were Persteins, Kostkové z Postupic and Hrzánové. Research documents of the 1870s compiled by village teacher Jandl are showing that this church was one of the oldest in the neighborhood.|$|R

50|$|A {{fire rake}} is a {{wildland}} fire fighting tool. A fire rake has a wooden or fiberglass handle with a <b>rake</b> <b>head</b> consisting of four very sharp, serrated, triangular steel blades. It {{is used to}} rake a fire break with the sharp teeth enabling it to reach fire in undergrowth in addition to loose surface debris. Another type of fire rake which {{looks more like a}} steel rake but with sharp edges on the teeth, and is sometimes referred to as a rake hoe is called a McLeod. The teeth of the more traditional fire rake which resemble the teeth of a great white shark allow it to get deeper into the undergrowth when necessary. But the preference for one over the other is somewhat subjective.|$|E

50|$|Compared {{with the}} {{standard}} Bonneville, the Bonneville America has a very different ride, with the wheelbase extended 6.4 in to 65.2 in, making it 6.8 in longer overall. The saddle was lowered 2.2 in and the steering <b>head</b> <b>rake</b> angle increased by 4.3 degrees giving a 33.3 degree rake. The America had the Bonneville's 12.2 in front disc but the front wheel was reduced to 18 in diameter and the rear wheel to 15 in with a larger 11.2 in disc brake. The America also had a larger fuel tank with a 'chromed' plastic console to house the filler, 4.5 in diameter speedometer and warning lights. The side panels were extended with sheet-metal covers over the passenger-peg brackets and perforated chrome fittings behind the carburettors to provide the 'retro look' of the air-filter covers from the 1960 Triumph twins. The rider's footrests were also moved {{to the front of}} the engine to create a 'cruiser' riding position.|$|R
40|$|In {{the energy}} {{efficient}} transport (EET) Horizontal Tails Investigation, aerodynamic data were measured for five different horizontal tails {{on a full}} span model with a wide body fuselage. Three of the horizontal tails were low tail configurations and two were T tail configurations. All tails were tested in conjunction with two wings, a current wide body wing and a high aspect ratio supercritical wing. Local downwash angles and dynamic pressures {{in the vicinity of}} the tails were measured using a yaw <b>head</b> <b>rake.</b> The results provide a comparison of the aerodynamic characteristics of the two wing configurations at trimmed conditions for Mach numbers between 0. 60 and 0. 90. In the EET Lateral Controls Investigation, the control effectiveness of a conventional set of lateral controls was measured over a Mach number range from 0. 60 to 0. 90 on a high aspect ratio supercritical wing semispan model. The conventional controls included a high speed aileron, a low speed aileron, and six spoiler segments. The wing was designed so that the last 25 % of the chord is removable to facilitate testing of various control systems. The current status and an indication of the data obtained in these investigations are presented...|$|R
50|$|The {{martial eagle}} {{is one of}} the world's most {{powerful}} avian predators. Due to both its underside spotting and ferocious efficiency as a predator it is sometimes nicknamed “the leopard of the air”. The martial eagle is an apex predator, being {{at the top of the}} avian food chain in its environment. In its common, scientific and most regional African names, this species name means “war-like” and indicates the force, brashness and indefatigable nature of their hunting habits. The aggressiveness of the hunting martial eagle, which may rival that of the overall behaviorally bolder crowned eagle, can seem incongruous with their other behaviours, as it otherwise is considered a shy, wary and evasive bird. Martial eagles have been seen to charge at much larger adult ungulates and <b>rake</b> at their <b>heads</b> and flanks, at times presumably to separate the mammals from their young so they can take the latter with more ease. At other times, these eagles will set down upon a wide-range of potentially dangerous prey including other aggressive predators in broad daylight, such as monitor lizards, venomous snakes, jackals and medium-sized wild cats. Adult eagles tend to hunt larger, potentially dangerous prey more often than immature ones, presumably as they refine their hunting skills with maturity. The martial eagle hunts mostly in flight, circling at a great height anywhere in its home range. When prey is perceived with their superb vision, the hunting eagle then stoops sharply to catch its prey by surprise with the prey often being unable to perceive the eagle at nearly as far as the eagle can perceive them despite often being in the open. The martial eagle tends to hunt in a long, shallow stoop, however when the quarry is seen in a more enclosed space, it parachutes down at a relatively steeper angle. The speed of descent is controlled by the angle at which the wings are held above the back. At the point of impact, it shoots its long legs forward, often killing victims on impact somewhat like large falcons often dispatch their prey. Prey may often be spotted from 3 to 5 km away with a record of about 6 km. On occasion, they may still-hunt from a high perch or concealed in vegetation near watering holes. If the initial attempt fails, they may swoop around to attempt again, especially if the intended victim is not dangerous. If the quarry is potentially hazardous, such as mammalian carnivores, venomous snakes or large ungulates, and becomes aware of the eagle too soon, the hunt tends to be abandoned. Unusually for a bird of its size, it may rarely hover while hunting. This hunting method may be employed particularly if the quarry is any of the aforementioned potentially dangerous prey items such as venomous snakes or carnivores. Other large eagles may hunt similarly (if infrequently) hover over prey such as canids and then quickly drop onto if the quarry makes the mistake of pointing its dangerous mouth downwards, then gripping its victim on the back while controlling the neck with the other foot until blood-loss is sufficient to cause the prey to expire. Prey, including birds, are generally killed on the ground, with infrequent reports of prey taken from trees. Some larger (and presumably slower-flying) avian prey may be taken while in flight, victims of successful hunts as such have consisted of water birds such as herons, storks and geese. If kills are too large and heavy to carry in flight, both members of a pair may return to the kill over several days, probably roosting nearby. If nesting, the pair tends to dismember pieces of large kills such as limbs to bring to the nest. Much of the large prey, perhaps most, that is left on the ground is lost to scavengers, however.The diet of the martial eagle varies greatly with prey availability and can be dictated largely by opportunity. Remarkably, mammals, birds and reptiles can in turn dominate the prey selection of martial eagles in a given area with no one prey type globally dominating their prey spectrum. In some areas, both mammals and birds can each comprise more than 80% of the prey selection. Over 160 prey species have been reported for the martial eagle which is a much higher number than the full prey spectrum of other larger African booted eagles, and even this may neglect some of the prey they take in the little studied populations from west and Central Africa and the northern part of east Africa. Prey may vary considerably in size but for the most part, prey weighing less than 0.5 kg are ignored by hunting martial eagles, with only about 15% of the known prey species averaging less than this. A majority of studies report the average size of prey for martial eagles being between 1 and 5 kg. Average weight of prey taken as been reported at as low as 1.2 kg. However, the mean prey body mass is considerably higher in known dietary studies. In by far the largest dietary study thus far conducted for the martial eagle species (in the Cape Province, South Africa) the estimated mean prey body mass was approximately 2.26 kg. In Tsavo East National Park of Kenya, the mean estimated body mass of prey was quite similar at approximately 2.31 kg. Despite perhaps a majority of prey for this species weighing less than 5 kg, martial eagles regular prey size range is claimed at up to 12 to 15 kg. There is some evidence of prey partitioning (which can be potentially delineated both by prey species and body size of prey items taken) between the sexes. This is typical of raptors with pronounced size sexual dimorphism, as is the case in martial eagles. For instance, in populations where large adult monitor lizards are significant as prey, they only start to appear in prey remains at nests only after the female resumes hunting in the latter part of the breeding season.|$|R
