30|$|The {{following}} <b>remarks</b> {{related to}} the symptom attribute (40 <b>remarks)</b> in the questionnaire were categorized: no evaluation criteria are given (5 <b>remarks),</b> need for benchmark (6 <b>remarks),</b> difficulty choosing only one response (4 <b>remarks),</b> distinction between response options is ambiguous (7 <b>remarks),</b> response options are inadequate (6 <b>remarks),</b> questions and response options need to be reformed (7 <b>remarks),</b> and inconsistency between questions and response options (4 <b>remarks),</b> and other (1 <b>remarks).</b> The following <b>remarks</b> related to ease of memory retrieval and judgment (26 <b>remarks)</b> were categorized: some symptoms are hard to notice (6 <b>remarks),</b> need for exemplars of symptoms (10 <b>remarks),</b> significance of the question should be clarified (3 <b>remarks),</b> problems interpreting “interference with daily activities” (4 <b>remarks),</b> and problems apprehending the severity of symptoms at their worst (3 <b>remarks).</b> Other <b>remarks</b> on the questionnaire include the phrase “in the last 7  days,” which complicated questions (5 <b>remarks).</b> Participants with constant subjective symptoms in particular seemed to find it challenging to confine the interpretation of their symptom experience to only the severity or interference experienced “in the last 7  days.” Regarding the two alternative wordings of “its worst,” the responses were varied among responders and symptoms. Following agreement on changes among the project team, ultimately we kept the initial wording, which is the objective term discussed above, in the final version.|$|R
30|$|We {{conducted}} a qualitative-descriptive analysis using semi-structured cognitive interviews. The interviews were transcribed word-for-word, examined repeatedly, and categorized. <b>Remarks</b> were {{split into two}} categories: 1) <b>remarks</b> on the items and 2) <b>remarks</b> on the questionnaire in general. The <b>remarks</b> on the items were further categorized into those concerning 1) comprehension difficulties, 2) clarity, 3) knowledge and recall (ease of memory retrieval), and 4) ease of judgment and other spontaneous comments. The <b>remarks</b> on the questionnaire were also further categorized into those concerning 1) attributes, 2) ease of memory retrieval and judgment, 3) other <b>remarks</b> on the questionnaire, and 4) other <b>remarks</b> in general. As a single patient could make several <b>remarks,</b> {{the total number of}} <b>remarks</b> does not reflect the number of patients. We performed descriptive statistics to summarize the variables for the cognitive interviews.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{collaborative}} learning, {{a discussion}} sometimes {{comes to a}} standstill because no comments have been made or no conflicting opinions have been offered. Activation <b>remarks,</b> which might solve such situations using past discussions, may be effective for similar situations. Our research group proposed a framework that applies the activation <b>remarks</b> of past discussions that were stored in a database to ongoing discussions based on case-based reasoning (CBR). To utilize past activation <b>remarks,</b> they should be modified to fit the current situations. We introduce a method for modifying selected activation <b>remarks</b> that contain situation-dependent words about the current discussion especially on <b>remarks</b> that contain words about the remaining time or topics. Our method grasps {{the time and the}} topics of ongoing discussions and creates activation <b>remarks</b> by replacing situation dependent words to words of ongoing discussion. Our experimental result showed that our proposed method created valid and effective activation <b>remarks</b> when appropriate past <b>remarks</b> were selected from the only one case-base...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the many}} factors in his success was Como's insistence on his {{principles}} of good taste; if he considered something to be in bad or questionable taste, {{it was not in}} the show or broadcast.

5|$|The best {{interests}} of society require that causes of action should not be deferred an unreasonable time. This <b>remark</b> is peculiarly applicable to land titles.
