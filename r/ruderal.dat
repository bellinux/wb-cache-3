5|$|Within the York {{distribution}} {{the beetles}} {{are dependent on}} tansy as their sole food source; if a clump disappears the beetles are forced to walk to a new location as they rarely fly, despite having fully working wings and being capable of doing so. The loss of habitat impacts upon {{the ability of the}} tansy beetle to find an alternative source of the host plant. Additionally, tansy is a <b>ruderal</b> species and thus has a naturally high rate of turnover of plants, forcing beetles to regularly seek out new tansy patches to colonise.|$|E
30|$|An {{encouraging}} {{result of}} this study was the lack of a generally positive response of <b>ruderals</b> to fire. Although some <b>ruderals</b> responded positively to fires, others did not. Low-intensity surface fires are not severe disturbances, and thus in one sense they should not be expected to favor <b>ruderals</b> or other species dependent upon soil disturbances or other lethal factors (Grime 1979, Roberts 2007, Brewer and Bailey 2014). There were some native <b>ruderals</b> that initially responded positively to canopy reduction by the tornado, but then declined over time (e.g., American burnweed and dogfennel). The decline in these species coincided with a significant increase in perennial <b>ruderals</b> moderately indicative of severe disturbances, such as sawtoothed blackberry. The net effect of these changes was no general decline or increase in <b>ruderals</b> over time as a function of either canopy reduction or fire.|$|R

5|$|Wind {{dispersal}} of seeds, or anemochory, {{is one of}} the more primitive means of dispersal. Wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms: seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively, they can flutter to the ground. The classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include dandelions (Taraxacum spp., Asteraceae), which have a feathery pappus attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances, and maples (Acer (genus) spp., Sapindaceae), which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground. An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for germination. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland. Reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many weedy or <b>ruderal</b> species. Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include tumbleweeds. A related process to anemochory is anemophily, which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind. Large families of plants are pollinated in this manner, which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together.|$|E

25|$|Senecio vulgaris, often {{known by}} the common names {{groundsel}} and old-man-in-the-Spring, is a flowering plant in the daisy family Asteraceae. It is an annual herb, native to Europe and widely naturalised as a <b>ruderal</b> species in suitable disturbed habitats worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{classes of}} weeds share adaptations to <b>ruderal</b> environments. That is to say: {{disturbed}} environments where soil or natural vegetative cover has been damaged or frequently gets damaged, disturbances {{that give the}} weeds advantages over desirable crops, pastures, or ornamental plants. The nature of the habitat and its disturbances will affect or even determine which types of weed communities become dominant.|$|E
50|$|Sand dunes {{provide a}} range of {{habitats}} for {{a range of}} unusual, interesting and characteristic plants that can cope with disturbed habitats. In the UK these may include restharrow Ononis repens, sand spurge Euphorbia arenaria and ragwort Senecio vulgaris - such plants are termed <b>ruderals.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Ruderals</b> are {{plant species}} that prosper in {{situations}} of high intensity disturbance and low intensity stress. These species are fast-growing and rapidly complete their life cycles, and generally produce large amounts of seeds. Plants that have adapted this strategy are often found colonizing recently disturbed land, and are often annuals.|$|R
50|$|The {{area with}} most species (center of diversity) are the deserts and semideserts of Central-Asia and the Middle East. Distribution of the {{subfamily}} {{extends to the}} Mediterranean, to Middle-Europe, north and south Africa, and Australia, some species have also been introduced to America. Many species grow in dry habitats (xerophytes) or tolerate salty soils (halophytes), some are <b>ruderals.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{coast from}} Bridlington {{in the north}} to Spurn Point is an {{interesting}} complex of coastal processes. The soft cliffs of Holderness are subject to rapid erosion whilst the eroded material is being deposited on the Spurn peninsula. The speed of erosion along the glacial till cliffs prohibits colonisation of anything but sparse <b>ruderal</b> vegetation. Coltsfoot is particularly common and sand martin colonies have become established in places.|$|E
25|$|The {{differentiation}} between Beta and Patellifolia probably occurred {{early in the}} Late Oligocene. The Mediterranean ancestors of Beta began to differentiate around seven million years ago (Messinian Age of the Late Miocene). They evolved into two well-differentiated clades {{on each side of}} the Mediterranean: the western wild beets Beta vulgaris, Beta macrocarpa, and Beta patula, occurring in coastal and <b>ruderal</b> habitats; and the easternmost wild beets Beta corolliflora, Beta nana and Beta trigyna, occurring in continental mountainous zones.|$|E
25|$|Examples of such <b>ruderal</b> or pioneer species include {{plants that}} are adapted to {{naturally}} occurring disturbed environments such as dunes and other windswept areas with shifting soils, alluvial flood plains, river banks and deltas, and areas that are burned repeatedly. Since human agricultural practices often mimic these natural environments where weedy species have evolved, some weeds are effectively preadapted to grow and proliferate in human-disturbed areas such as agricultural fields, lawns, roadsides, and construction sites. The weedy nature of these species often gives them an advantage over more desirable crop species because they often grow quickly and reproduce quickly, they commonly have seeds that persist in the soil seed bank for many years, or they may have short lifespans with multiple generations in the same growing season. In contrast, perennial weeds often have underground stems that spread under the soil surface or, like ground ivy (Glechoma hederacea), have creeping stems that root and spread out over the ground.|$|E
50|$|Many {{agricultural}} weeds are ephemeral {{and reproduce}} rapidly after human disturbance from plowing. Roadside weeds similarly exploit the disturbance from road construction and mowing. These plants rarely have any commercial use, {{and can be}} invasive weeds. Examples include: Cardamine hirsuta and Cannabis ruderalis. Plants which have short life spans, rapid rates of growth, {{and high levels of}} seed production are also termed <b>ruderals.</b>|$|R
30|$|Habitats {{associated}} with severe anthropogenic disturbance specifically included disturbed areas, waste places, areas with <b>ruderals,</b> fallow fields, wet fields and pastures, ditches, borrow pits, lawns, paths, old home sites, gardens, ditch banks, disturbed soils in wet areas, wet disturbed sandy soils, sandy-peaty ditches, roadsides, railroads, and pastures. In contrast {{to open and}} forest habitats, non-native species were not assumed non-indicative of severely disturbed habitats.|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} environmental factors {{that lead to}} negative changes in groups of butterflies is the isolation and fragmentation of habitats and overgrown remnants of steppe ecosystems of trees and shrubs.

500|$|Finally, panicled aster (Symphyotrichum lanceolatum) is {{also present}} among the {{invasive}} plants. In their native countries, American asters {{are found in}} wet places. In France, these plants colonize relatively dry <b>ruderal</b> areas (brownfields, road shoulder ...) or wetlands. In this second case, asters show strong invasive behavior.

500|$|The Nauru {{reed warbler}} is endemic {{to the island}} of Nauru, in the Pacific Ocean. It {{is one of only}} two {{indigenous}} land birds which breed on the island, the other being the Micronesian pigeon. The warbler can be found throughout the island, thriving in the scrubland in areas previously used for phosphate mining, as well as the remaining patches of forest on the island's central plateau. It is most common in the remains of forest found on the island's steep slopes. It is also readily observed in gardens and <b>ruderal</b> areas on the island's coast; in 1881, Finsch described the species as abundant, calling it [...] "as common as the House-Sparrow in England." [...] Biologist Donald Buden again found it widespread on the island in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is {{the most}} common of the four native species of Eriophorum in the British Isles, and has been {{recorded}} as having existed in all vice-counties, thriving particularly well in Ireland and northern and western regions of Great Britain, but less so in southern and eastern areas. In the mires of Northern Ireland and the South Pennines, it considered a <b>ruderal,</b> pioneer and keystone species, because it can quickly colonise and repair damaged or eroded peat, encourage the re-vegetation of its surroundings, and retain sediment and its landscape to serve as a carbon sink. In central and southern counties of England, the species is rare or absent, and was [...] "completely destroyed" [...] in Cambridgeshire, The Broads, The Fens {{and other parts of the}} East of England by human activities such as land reclamation. Within the British Isles, E.angustifolium thrives at a range of altitudes from sea-level fens and lowland meadows, to exposed upland moors when provided with a habitat of acid bog or waterlogged heath.

500|$|In 2006 the {{bumblebee}} researcher Dave Goulson {{founded a}} registered charity, the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, {{to prevent the}} extinction [...] "of any of the UK's bumblebees." [...] In 2009 and 2010, the Trust attempted to reintroduce the short-haired bumblebee, Bombus subterraneus, which had become extinct in Britain, from the British-derived populations surviving in New Zealand from their introduction there a century earlier. From 2011 the Trust, in partnership with Natural England, Hymettus and the RSPB, has reintroduced short-haired bumblebee queens from Skåne in southern Sweden to restored flower-rich meadows at Dungeness in Kent. The queens were checked for mites and American foulbrood disease. Agri-environment schemes spread across the neighbouring area of Romney Marsh {{have been set up}} to provide over 800 hectares of additional flower-rich habitat for the bees. By the summer of 2013, workers of the species were found near the release zone, proving that nests had been established. The restored habitat has produced a revival in at least five [...] "Schedule 41 priority" [...] species: the <b>ruderal</b> bumblebee, Bombus ruderatus; [...] the red-shanked carder bee, Bombus ruderarius; the shrill carder bee, Bombus sylvarum; the brown-banded carder bee, Bombus humilis and the moss carder bee, [...] Bombus muscorum.|$|E

40|$|The {{vascular}} flora of 62 Danish beech {{forests of}} eastern Jutland {{ranging in size}} from 1 – 445 ha, was investigated for species–area relations. Species richness reflecting total diversity, forest diversity, and of different habitat groups, were corrected for non-linearity by means of a log–log power function transformation and regressed to forest area. The transformed forest species diversity showed a negative relationship with forest area. It is highly questionable whether the often stated positive correlation between forest area and species number is valid when the total species numbers are corrected for the area-error. The often stated theorem that the larger the forest, the smaller the disturbance, is not valid in Danish broad-leaved forests. On the contrary, if the number of <b>ruderals</b> is taken as an indication of human disturbance, the correlation of area with the proportion of <b>ruderals</b> to all species and to forest species, both failed to detect correlation with area. This is probably due to the less intensive management regimes in small forests compared with larger forests. A substantially larger number of forest species is found in ancient forest than in middle-aged forest. This shows the great importance of forest continuity for the species diversity. Lists of indicator species for ancient and old broad-leaved forest are presented. The corrected species diversity value is recommended as a good nature quality indicator, to be used i...|$|R
