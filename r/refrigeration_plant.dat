5|$|O'Brien {{intended}} the brewery to be a modern facility {{similar to those}} in California, and brought in Charles Bolbrugge, a brewer from San Francisco, to run the operation. The facility probably took the form of a tower brewery, which minimised the requirements for power supplies, and had a cooperage built adjacent to it. Some of the equipment was probably reused from the local Eldorado Bottling works, which had closed three years before, and possibly the old Dawson City Brewery, which was then combined with up-to-date steam pumps, bottling machines and an artificial <b>refrigeration</b> <b>plant.</b> A variety of second-hand bottles were probably collected from around Dawson City, many of which were then reused at the new brewery, the remainder being discarded along the nearby river shore. The malt and hops for the brewing process were imported from California.|$|E
5|$|To promote sustainability, {{the site}} was {{selected}} directly adjacent to an already used part of a major ski area. It was also designed to minimize vegetation and the ecological footprint in the area. For energy efficiency, trees were retained to cast shade with weather protection and a shading system used to cover parts of the track. The track itself is painted white to maintain low temperatures while minimizing energy demand on the refrigeration system. Waste heat from the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>plant</b> is captured and reused to heat buildings on-site, and could provide other heat uses in the future. Any wood waste created from site clearing activities during venue construction was composted for reuse. Other on-site buildings also followed similar green building design principles.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, Ajax Bay on Falkland Sound, was {{developed}} by the Colonial Development Corporation in the 1950s, which was also responsible for developing Port Albemarle. It was mainly a <b>refrigeration</b> <b>plant,</b> and was supposed to freeze Falkland mutton, but this was found to be economically unviable, despite the huge expense incurred. Many of the pre-fabricated houses here were moved to Stanley. The site later became a British field hospital during the landings of Operation Sutton.|$|E

25|$|In 1880 Davidson {{convinced}} {{the company to}} invest in refrigeration. Teaming up with James Galbraith of the Albion shipping company, they approached John Bell and Sons and Joseph James Coleman, who {{had been involved in}} American chilled beef shipments. As a result of negotiations, Albion agreed to refit the Dunedin with a Bell-Coleman compression refrigeration machine, cooling the entire hold. Using 3 tons of coal a day, this steam-powered machine could chill the hold to 40 degrees Fahrenheit below surrounding air temperature, freezing the cargo in the temperate climate of southern New Zealand, and then maintaining it beneath zero through the tropics. The Dunedin was refitted in May 1881, the most visible sign being a funnel for the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>plant</b> between her fore and main masts - sometimes leading her to be mistaken for a steamship. The refitted Dunedin arrived in Dunedin's Port Chalmers at the end of November 1881.|$|E

500|$|Several design {{innovations}} and {{new technologies}} {{were used for}} the 1960 Games. The speed skating, figure skating and ice hockey events were held on artificial ice {{for the first time in}} Olympic history. A <b>refrigeration</b> <b>plant</b> capable of heating 4,800 homes had to be built to generate and maintain the ice. The heat generated from the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>plant</b> was used to warm spectators, provide hot water, and melt the snow off of roofs. New timing equipment provided by Longines was installed that used a quartz clock to measure to the hundredths of a second. IBM provided a computer that was capable of tabulating results and printing them in English and French. Blyth Arena, site of the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the figure skating and ice hockey competitions, was built with a [...] gap in the roof, which would slide closed as the cables supporting the roof contracted during cold weather.|$|E
500|$|The cattle {{that usually}} grazed on the {{outskirts}} of the town presented a problem; if they were left, they would be lost to the Boers, but if they were slaughtered, the meat would perish quickly in the summer heat.

500|$|After {{ecological}} objections forced subterranean pipeline crossings (in {{order to}} allow caribou to cross), engineers developed a system by which the ground near the pipeline would be refrigerated by chilled brine. These refrigerated sections also would be placed in Styrofoam-lined trenches and covered with gravel for their insulation value. Altogether, [...] of the pipeline {{was designed to be}} built underground in this way. In other places, a lack of permafrost meant it could simply be placed underground without a special <b>refrigeration</b> <b>plant.</b> Large amounts of gravel were needed for all sections of the pipeline as insulation to keep the heat of above-ground structures from melting the permafrost. Gravel also was needed to build the construction and maintenance road, and surveyors located 470 sites across Alaska where the needed [...] of gravel could be located.|$|E
500|$|The first {{concrete}} was {{poured into}} the dam on June 6, 1933, 18months ahead of schedule. Since concrete heats and contracts as it cures, the potential for uneven cooling and contraction of the concrete posed a serious problem. Bureau of Reclamation engineers calculated that if the dam was built in a single continuous pour, the concrete would take 125 years to cool, and the resulting stresses would cause the dam to crack and crumble. Instead, the ground where the dam would rise was marked with rectangles, and concrete blocks in columns were poured, some as large as [...] and [...] high. Each five-foot form contained a series of [...] steel pipes; cool riverwater would be poured through the pipes, followed by ice-cold water from a <b>refrigeration</b> <b>plant.</b> When an individual block had cured and had stopped contracting, the pipes were filled with grout. Grout was also used to fill the hairline spaces between columns, which were grooved to increase {{the strength of the}} joins.|$|E
50|$|As an example, if the {{refrigerator}} delivers 1.8 K helium to the cryomodule where the cavity and heat leak dissipate Pcold=10 W, then {{the refrigerator}} having Twarm=300 K and &eta;p=0.3 would have &eta;C=0.006 and a wall-plug power of Pwarm=5.5 kW. Of course, most accelerator facilities have numerous SRF cavities, so the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>plants</b> {{can get to}} be very large installations.|$|R
50|$|The {{crossing}} of the Seine also involved the freezing of saturated ground between the station of Saint-Michel and the Seine, under {{the line of the}} Chemin de Fer de Paris à Orléans (now RER line C) in 1908 and 1909. The installation of two <b>refrigeration</b> <b>plants</b> allowed the movement of brine cooled to −25 °C in dozens of tubes to stabilize the ground.|$|R

500|$|Repairs to {{structural}} elements {{on the lower}} levels of 1 WTC were made following the 1993 bombing. The greatest damage occurred on levels B1 and B2, with significant structural damage also on level B3. [...] Primary structural columns were not damaged, but secondary steel members experienced some damage. Floors that were blown out needed to be repaired to restore the structural support they provided to columns. The slurry wall was in peril following the bombing and loss of the floor slabs which provided lateral support to counteract pressure from Hudson River water on the other side. [...] The <b>refrigeration</b> <b>plant</b> on sublevel B5, which provided air conditioning to the entire World Trade Center complex, was heavily damaged and replaced with a temporary system for the summer of 1993. [...] The fire alarm system for the entire complex needed to be replaced, after critical wiring and signaling in the original system was destroyed in the 1993 bombing. Installation of the new system took years to complete, and replacement of some components was still underway in September 2001.|$|E
500|$|Before {{and during}} construction, workers and {{engineers}} experienced problems. Contracts {{for companies to}} construct the {{various parts of the}} dam were difficult to award as few companies were sizable enough to fill them. This forced companies to consolidate. In addition, Native American graves had to be relocated and temporary fish ladders had to be constructed. During construction additional problems included landslides and the need to protect newly poured concrete from freezing. Construction on the downstream Grand Coulee Bridge began in [...] and more considerable earth-moving began in August. Excavation for the dam's foundation required the removal of [...] of dirt and stone. To reduce the amount of trucking required in the excavation, a conveyor belt nearly [...] long was built. To further secure the foundation, workers drilled [...] holes into the granite and filled any fissures with grout, creating a grout curtain. At times, excavated areas collapsed from overburden. In order to secure these areas from further movement and continue excavation, 3-inch (76mm) diameter pipes were inserted into the mass and chilled with cold liquid from a <b>refrigeration</b> <b>plant.</b> This froze the earth and secured it so construction could continue.|$|E
500|$|Blyth Memorial Arena was the {{centerpiece}} of the Games. It hosted the opening and closing ceremonies jointly with Squaw Valley Olympic Skating Rink, and also hosted the figure skating competition, a few of the speed skating events, as well as most of the games in the hockey tournament. [...] All three of the sports were held indoors on artificial ice {{for the first time in}} Olympic history. [...] At full capacity, the arena accommodated 11,000 people, 8,500 of whom were seated. [...] One end of the stadium could be opened and closed, depending on the event. During the ceremonies it was open to allow for the entrance of the athletes; during the competitions it was closed to accommodate more spectators. A special machine was created to resurface the ice for all three competitions. It could lay a new ice surface on the 400-meter speed skating track in 45minutes. In addition to resurfacing the ice, the machine created the snow dividers that delineated the racing lanes. [...] The roof was designed on a suspension principle, using cables rather than vertical supports; this removed any visual impediments for the audience, but it weakened the strength of the roof. Given the amount of annual snowfall designers planned on using heat generated by the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>plant</b> to melt the snow. [...] There were flaws in the design and miscalculations in the load the roof could bear, and during a particularly heavy snowfall in 1983, a portion of the roof collapsed and the building was subsequently demolished.|$|E
40|$|On board marine vessels {{there is}} a large demand for keeping {{provision}} chilled or frozen and controlling the accommodation climate, this demand is achieved with the help of onboard <b>refrigeration</b> <b>plants.</b> The refrigerants that are used in today’s <b>refrigeration</b> <b>plants</b> are harmful to the environment and continuous research are carried out to develop refrigerants that are less harmful. Studies show that using refrigerants that are less harmful to the environment results in a more inferior energy efficiency, which leads to the importance of improving the design of the system and its components. In this study, measures for achieving a better energy efficiency of <b>refrigeration</b> <b>plants</b> on board ships are examined and surveyed. A literature study has been conducted to investigate what measures are available in the area. To maintain an objective view of the subject, the literature studies were combined and compared with information and opinions collected from professionals via personal communication and a questionnaire survey. The study led to several potential efficiency measures which suitability to be applied in the shipping area varies. A measure with high potential for further application on board ships is the use of frequency control of the refrigeration compressor and, in some cases, other components as well. It can be concluded that there are many promising energy efficiency measures for refrigeration systems on board ships. The question is how the efficiency measures can be more attractive to apply to refrigeration systems on board ships, and how the interest in developing more sustainable technologies with minimal environmental impact will increase...|$|R
