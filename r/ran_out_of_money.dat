Alperson from Grand National Films, a newly established, {{independent}} studio, approached him to make movies for $100,000 a film and 10% of the profits. Cagney made two films for Grand National: Great Guy and Something to Sing About. He received good reviews for both, but overall the production quality was not up to Warner Bros. standards, and the films did not do well. A third film, Dynamite, was planned, but Grand National <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E

5|$|No.A816 {{emerged from}} Eastleigh in August 1931 for trials, but was stopped when {{temperature}} variations within the condensing equipment caused water leakage. Modifications {{were made to}} improve the draughting of the locomotive, incorporating a box-like chimney attached to the condenser array by pipes. No.A816 was released for more trials, and produced performances well-below those displayed by the unmodified members of the class. The experiment was ended when the system's developers <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> and the locomotive was converted back to standard form between May and August 1935, re-entering service as No.1816.|$|E

5|$|Fish and Shawn McGrath {{collaborated on}} a puzzle game that became Fez. When McGrath left the project due to {{creative}} differences, Fish, the game's artist, pursued a platform game direction with Renaud Bédard, the game's programmer, {{who wrote the}} game's level editor and game engine from scratch. Levels were built in 3D by extruding surfaces with Photoshop-created textures. Bédard and Fish were joined by three different animators and other collaborators. The game was first announced in June 2007 and won an award at the 2008 Independent Games Festival and entered the public spotlight. Fish created a studio, Polytron Corporation, and was later aided by nearby developer-publisher Trapdoor when Polytron <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> Fez won several more prerelease awards, including the 2012 Seumas McNally Grand Prize.|$|E

In 1968, despite Graham Edwards winning the National 200m breaststroke title, the Australian Swimming Union persuaded an overweight O'Brien to make a comeback in 1968 on the grounds that Australia did not have a quality breaststroker for the Olympics. Undergoing a crash diet and fitness program, O'Brien lost 12.7kg in twelve weeks of intense training. O'Brien was unable to reclaim either of his individual Australian titles, but New South Wales again won the medley relay. Nevertheless, he was selected for his second Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Marie-Pascale Elfman, at {{the time}} of shooting, was married to {{director}} Richard Elfman. She designed the film's expressionistic sets and starred in the film. Actor and former Mystic Knight Gene Cunningham helped fund the film. When Cunningham and Elfman <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> during production, Richard and Marie-Pascale Elfman helped finance by selling houses, before Carl Borack put money into the production in order for Elfman to complete the film. According to Elfman, he had originally intended the film to be screened in color, stating that the original plan was to ship the film to China, where each frame would be hand-tinted, but that this plan was not practical within the production costs.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} quickly {{descended into}} a debacle. Aristagoras fell out with Megabates {{on the journey}} towards Naxos, and Herodotus says that Megabates then sent messengers to Naxos, warning the Naxians of the force's intention. It is also possible, however, that this story was spread by Aristagoras after the event, {{by way of a}} justification for the subsequent failure of the campaign. At any rate, the Naxians were able to prepare properly for a siege, and the Persians arrived to a well-defended expedition. The Persians laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually they and Aristagoras both <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> The force sailed back to the mainland without a victory.|$|E

When Harry Gilmer was fired as Lions' head coach after the 1966 NFL season, however, Rymkus was once again out of work. He got a job as an assistant for the Akron Vulcans of the Continental Football League and was appointed the team's head coach and general manager in 1967. Rymkus stayed in the position until the team folded later that year due to financial difficulties; the team's owner, Frank Hurn, <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and stopped paying the Vulcans' bills.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball is an action, sports {{video game}} for the iPad by Mikengreg, an {{independent}} development team of Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. Players flick basketballs through 2D physics puzzles into the hoop in single-player, local multiplayer, and asynchronous HORSE-style online multiplayer modes. The game is free-to-play with in-app purchases. Development began in mid 2011 following Mikengreg's successful Solipskier. They were able to live from the earnings for Gasketball two year development at their previous salary, which afforded them the stability to try new avenues and reject prototypes, though they worked 100-hour weeks. Towards {{the end of their}} development, they <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and lived on the couches of friends. It was released on August 9, 2012, and the game did not reach their desired conversion rate at the time of launch.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball was {{developed}} and produced by Mikengreg, an Iowa-based two-man team: Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. After releasing their first game, the sport-inspired Solipskier for iPhone and iPad, Boxleiter and Wohlwend lived off the profits for two years while working on Gasketball, paying themselves their same salaries from their Adobe Flash development days but having the security to try new ideas. Wohlwend made somewhat more income due to other collaborations, such as Puzzlejuice with Asher Vollmer, but shared his income with Boxleiter. Development began in mid 2011. Even though Solipskier was successful, the duo {{did not have a}} following comparable to indie developers like Team Meat and thus did not feel pressured to meet high expectations. Instead, their pressure was internal. Wohlwend said he worked 100-hour weeks with no weekends or vacations while living on the Solipskier funds. When they <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> Boxleiter borrowed money from his parents, and eventually they both went homeless, living on the couches of friends.|$|E

50|$|Money the {{standard}} currency for all 3 factions, {{this is the}} resource that most Basic Heroes and Elite Heroes will use the most.

5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% of his team. As the team <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E
5|$|The Lilleaker Line, which {{connected}} to the street tramway at Skøyen, had been extended to Kolsås in 1930. The owner Bærumsbanen instead wanted the line to go the faster route via the Common Tunnel to Nationaltheatret. Concession was granted in 1938 for a link from Jar on the Lilleaker Line to Sørbyhaugen on the Røa Line. The construction was delayed because a bridge needed to be built across Mærradalen, and the company <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> and construction stopped for nine months in 1940. The line was opened on 15 June 1942, and the section from Sørbyhaugen to Kolsås was renamed the Kolsås Line. This resulted in two companies operating from Sørbyhaugen to Nationaltheatret, but an agreement was made where only Holmenkolbanen's tickets were sold on the section, so all revenue went to that company, regardless of the train's operator. The Kolsås Line operated every fifteen minutes along the Røa Line part.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} sailed in {{the spring}} of 499 BC but quickly descended into a debacle The force laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually the Persians and Aristagoras both <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> The force therefore sailed despondently back to the mainland. Aristagoras found himself in dire straits and fully expected to be stripped of his position by Artaphernes. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt. Although Herodotus presents the revolt as a consequence of Aristagoras's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway, the primary grievance being the tyrants installed by the Persians. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia (and Aeolis and Doris), and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.|$|E
