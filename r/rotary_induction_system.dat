5000|$|Introduced in 1967, the 350 GTR was, for its time, a middleweight {{displacement}} motorcycle, {{and used}} an air-cooled [...] two-stroke parallel-twin engine, which produced [...] at 7,500 rpm. Although a mostly conventional design, the engine used a <b>rotary</b> disc-valve <b>induction</b> <b>system,</b> allowing more precise {{management of the}} gasses inside the engine than traditional piston-port systems did. Two of these disc valves were used (one per cylinder), and a 26 mm Mikuni carburettor was bolted to each one. The six-speed gearbox was also a plus point, as was the ability for the 350 GTR's riders to use either their left foot or their right foot to change gear; the gear lever and rear brake pedals could be swapped around {{in order to allow}} this. However, the gearbox did cause issues for some riders, as neutral was located in an unusual place; {{at the top of the}} gearbox, as most motorcycles placed this gear between first and second. Chassis-wise, the 350 GTR was fairly conventional, as it used a steel twin-cradle frame, gaitered front forks with twin shock absorbers at the rear, 19" [...] wheels and drum brakes.|$|R
50|$|Linear {{induction}} motors, which work on {{same general}} principles as <b>rotary</b> <b>induction</b> motors (frequently three-phase), {{are designed to}} produce straight line motion. Uses include magnetic levitation, linear propulsion, linear actuators, and liquid metal pumping.|$|R
50|$|Linear {{induction}} motors {{are often}} less efficient than conventional <b>rotary</b> <b>induction</b> motors; the end effects {{and the relatively}} large air gap that is often present will typically reduce the forces produced for the same electrical power. The larger air gap also increases the inductance of the motor which can require larger and more expensive capacitors.|$|R
40|$|The {{mathematical}} model of cylindrical {{linear induction motor}} (C-LIM) fed via frequency converter {{is presented in the}} paper. The model was developed in order to analyze numerically the transient states. Problems concerning dynamics of ac-machines especially linear induction motor are presented in [1 – 7]. Development of C-LIM {{mathematical model}} is based on circuit method and analogy to <b>rotary</b> <b>induction</b> motor. The analogy between both: (a) stator and rotor windings of <b>rotary</b> <b>induction</b> motor and (b) winding of primary part of C-LIM (inductor) and closed current circuits in external secondary part of C-LIM (race) is taken into consideration. The equations of C-LIM mathematical model are presented as matrix together with equations expressing each vector separately. A computational analysis of selected transient states of C-LIM fed via frequency converter is presented in the paper. Two typical examples of C-LIM operation are considered for the analysis: (a) starting the motor at various static loads and various synchronous velocities and (b) reverse of the motor at the same operation conditions. Results of simulation are presented as transient responses including transient electromagnetic force, transient linear velocity and transient phase current. ...|$|R
