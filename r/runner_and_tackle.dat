50|$|The first Trinity Church building, {{a modest}} {{rectangular}} structure with a gambrel roof and small porch, {{was constructed in}} 1698, on Wall Street, facing the Hudson River. The land on which it was built was formerly a formal garden and then a burial ground. It was built because in 1696, members of the Church of England (Anglicans) protested to obtain a “charter granting the church legal status” in New York City. According to historical records, Captain William Kidd lent the <b>runner</b> <b>and</b> <b>tackle</b> from his ship for hoisting the stones.|$|E

500|$|Phillips, who was {{a strong}} <b>runner</b> <b>and</b> <b>tackled</b> well, made his {{international}} debut for Wales against [...] on 6 January 1900 at Gloucester. His initial selection was principally due to his partnership at Newport with Lloyd, who also made selection for Wales. Lloyd had already played in 1896 against Ireland, and against Scotland and Ireland in 1899. During the game, which Wales won 3–13, Phillips displayed 'special smartness' and used 'the acme of judgment' in his first international appearance, proving also to be a 'splendid defender'. He was reckoned to be amongst {{the best of the}} backs, and the combination with Lloyd was excellent. In the following match, against [...] at Swansea on 27 January, the half-back partnership of Phillips and Lloyd continued to perform: their defensive play was 'sound', and in attack, Phillips' 'splendid' fielding and kicking to touch, matched Lloyd's 'cleverness' and 'dodging ability'. Wales was again victorious, 12–3. For the next game, away to [...] at Belfast on 17 March, Lloyd was replaced by Selwyn Biggs of Cardiff. The half-back combination was not as good as with Lloyd but worked better than pundits had expected. The 0–3 victory over the Irish earned the Welsh the Triple Crown.|$|R
