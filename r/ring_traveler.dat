40|$|The {{practical}} {{paper is}} an applied concept of physics in textiles. The Research study shows {{the effect of}} yarn tension on yarn characteristics at ring frame stage which is very much dependent on centrifugal force (C. F.). The C. F on <b>ring</b> <b>traveler</b> varies by varying its mass. Due to varying circular motion of <b>ring</b> <b>traveler,</b> tension in yarn is varying in nature and results are correlated with yarn characteristics like fineness, strength, elongation and variation in mass per unit length. In study {{it is observed that}} an increase in centrifugal force decreases CSP, tenacity, thick places, thin places & neps& decrease in centrifugal force gives initially increase in yarn quality index then further increase in C. F. gives the trend of decrement in yarn quality index”...|$|E
50|$|While {{all this}} is going on for Bobby, his friends Courtney Chetwynde and Mark Dimond are on the {{receiving}} end of his Traveler journals, through a <b>Traveler</b> <b>ring</b> that Osa gave Mark in the middle of one night. Following the advice of Osa, Bobby and Loor are using their spare time to write logs of their journeys, which are sent to their respective home territories via the <b>Traveler</b> <b>rings.</b> These rings are made of the same stone which lines the flume; when the desired territory is named, the ring becomes a minuscule version of the flume, through which the journals are dropped.|$|R
40|$|The spin Guard Gardella is a {{centrifugal}} type {{dry spinning}} machine. In this machine yarn can be spun from 72 (2. 08 lbs. /spy) to 241 tex (7 lbs. /spy). But {{in this system}} of this machine, it is preferable to produce fine yarn. Here fine yarn 103 tex (3 lbs. /spy) was produced in existing speed. Apron Draft Spinning frame was modified into ring spinning system. In this system <b>rings</b> and <b>travelers</b> were used and fine yarn upto 103 tex (3 lbs. /spy) was produced. Bangla white B (BWB) grade jute fibres were used for producing fine yarn. The spinning performance and physical properties of produced yarn were found and compared. It {{was found that the}} yarn produced from Gardella spinning frame was better than modified ring spinning frame...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a method, which {{applied to the}} ring of the ring spinning machine will improve its productivity. Through the system vibra-tion is applied on the ring-traveller, which has effects on the centrifugal force of the traveller and helps the traveller to rotate around ring with intermittent contact. The effect of vibration on yarn tension as well as friction between the <b>ring</b> and the <b>traveler</b> and the corresponding raise in temperature of the ring during spinning are measured. An external facility is designed and incorporated in a miniature ring spinning frame to generate and apply vibration to the ring. The minia-ture ring spinning frame has the facility to vary twist and count of yarn and is modified to vary the spindle speed. Study shows that the ring-traveller friction {{is affected by the}} application of vibration. Results obtained with and without the applications of vibration are compared. It is found that yarn tension and friction between the ring and the traveller reduce significantly {{depending on the type of}} vibration. Therefore it can be concluded that application of vibration may be a way to reduce friction between the <b>ring</b> and the <b>traveler</b> and thus the mechanical process of twisting and winding can be done at higher speed for higher productivity which is a limiting factor of ring spinning system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Spindle {{speed is}} an {{important}} parameter {{for the production of}} jute yarn [1]. An Apron Draft spinning frame was modified in to ring system by incorporating <b>rings</b> and <b>travelers</b> instead of flyers. The experiments were performed for investigating the effect of spindle speed on textile properties and productivity of jute yarn of 103 tex. The spindle speed was varied from 5000 rpm to 9000 rpm. The experiments were performed with Bangla White B (BWB) grade jute sliver of finisher drawing of linear density 2415 tex (70 lb/spy). The draft ratio and the twist used in the experiments were 23 and 240 tpm (turns per meter) respectively. The ring size was KW (4) 76 mm Ø. Steel travelers number 1, Type G, semicircular in shape were used in the experiment. Ten runs were performed for the experiment at the standard atmospheric condition, 20 + 2 ˚C, and relative humidity 65 % + 2 %. The nominal count of the yarn produced was 103 tex. The yarns produced through the experiments were tested for different textile properties. Analysis of the test results shows that the spindle speed greatly influences the textile properties, such as strength, elongation, yarn breakage, productivity, quality ratio etc. of produced yarn. In consideration of the productivity, quality and other textile properties of the yarn, the optimum spindle speed was determined for the production of fine jute yarn of 103 tex...|$|R
60|$|Then he rode on, {{leading his}} pack-horse. The trail was not steep, {{although}} in places it had washed out, thus hindering a steady trot. As he progressed the forest grew thick and darker, and {{the fragrance of}} pine and spruce filled the air. A dreamy roar of water rushing over rocks <b>rang</b> in the <b>traveler's</b> ears. It receded at times, then grew louder. Presently the forest shade ahead lightened and he rode out into a wide space where green moss and flags and flowers surrounded a wonderful spring-hole. Sunset gleams shone through the trees to color the wide, round pool. It was shallow all along the margin, with a deep, large green hole in the middle, where the water boiled up. Trout were feeding on gnats and playing on the surface, and some big ones left wakes behind them as they sped to deeper water. Wade had an appreciative eye for all this beauty, his gaze lingering longest upon the flowers.|$|R
5000|$|A {{mortally wounded}} Patrick arrives on Denduron just as Alder and Bobby {{are about to}} leave. They heal him and send him back to Third Earth {{to find out what}} a {{possible}} Second Earth turning point could be. They then head to Second Earth to find Mark and Courtney. Bobby comes out in the flume below Naymeer's house. Just before Bobby arrives, Naymeer tells Mark and Courtney that the flumes and <b>Traveler</b> <b>rings</b> are made of dark matter. Bobby, Alder, Mark, and Courtney all talk with Naymeer who tells them he can't be stopped. They disagree and escape to Courtney's family's boat where they all decide that a vote to nominate Ravinia as [...] "spiritual advisor" [...] to the entire world is the turning point of Second Earth. Courtney's parents then show up with the cops. Another chase ensues and Mark and Courtney are captured but Bobby and Alder escape and take refuge with the main protester of Ravinia, Haig Gastigian.|$|R
5000|$|Full of angst {{over his}} role in the tragedy, Bobby returns to his home on Second Earth (the 21st-century) for a pause in his Travels. After a week, he {{receives}} a call from Gunny, and meets him back at Bobby's old house a few hours later. Gunny arrives in a limousine with an elderly man claiming to know Bobby's great grandfather (unknowingly referring to Bobby when he was on First Earth), and explains how Uncle Press had died, describing how an accomplice (who the Gangster revealed to be Saint Dane) persuaded Tony, the gangster's partner, into shooting a Tommy Gun into the flume. He states clearly that he never fired a bullet. He then gives Bobby his <b>Traveler</b> <b>ring</b> which the gangster took from him on First Earth. Bobby thanks the gangster, and he and Gunny accompany the gangster down town to the flume. This is where [...] "The Reality Bug" [...] begans.|$|R

Mark is then black-mailed into giving up his <b>Traveler</b> <b>ring</b> to Nevva. They then head to the flume only to be intercepted by Patrick who came to First Earth in search of Bobby after realizing he couldn't save Third Earth alone. Mark and Courtney then return to Second Earth with Patrick in tow. Upon arriving they find {{that many people are}} worshiping a new cult, Ravinia, and both flumes have been revealed by Alexander Naymeer who is the leader of Ravinia and the [...] "new" [...] traveler of Second Earth as Bobby has quit. He is using the ring Nevva took from Mark. The goal of Ravinia is to reward the people who contribute to society, while punishing those who do not. Mark, Courtney, and Patrick head to the other flume to get off of Second Earth only to be intercepted by Naymeer. A chase ensues and Patrick narrowly gets away but not before being shot. Mark and Courtney are captured and brought to Naymeer's home which happens to be on top of one of the flumes, in the Sherwood house.|$|R
