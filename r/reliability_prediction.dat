40|$|Power {{electronics}} uses {{semiconductor technology}} to convert and control electrical power. Demands for efficient energy management, conversion and conservation, {{and the increasing}} take-up of electronics in transport systems has resulted in tremendous growth {{in the use of}} power electronics devices such as Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT’s). The packaging of power electronics devices involves a number of challenges for the design engineer in terms of reliability. For example, IGBT modules will contain a number of semiconductor dies within a small footprint bonded to ubstrates with aluminum wires and wide area solder joints. To a great extent, the reliability of the package will depend on the thermo-mechanical behavior of these materials. This paper details a physics of failure approach to <b>reliability</b> <b>predictions</b> of IGBT modules.

40|$|Two {{methods are}} {{proposed}} {{to find the}} maximum likelihood parameter estimates {{of a number of}} software reliability models. On the basis of the results from analysing 7 sets of real data, these methods are found to be both efficient and reliable. The simple approach of adapting software <b>reliability</b> <b>predictions</b> by Keiller and Littlewood (1984) can produce improved predictions, but at the same time, introduces a lot of internal noise into the adapted predictions. This {{is due to the fact}} that the adaptor is a joined-up function. An alternative adaptive procedure, which involves the parametric spline adaptor, can produce at least as good adapted predictions without the predictions being contaminated by internal noise as in the simple approach. Miller and Sofer (1986 a) proposed a method for estimating the failure rate of a program non-parametrically. Here, these non-parametric rates are used to produce <b>reliability</b> <b>predictions</b> and their quality is analysed and compared with the parametric predictions...|$|R

40|$|Lifetime {{data from}} the field can be {{complicated}} due to truncation, censoring, multiple failure modes, and the nonhomogeneity of the population. These complications lead to difficulties in <b>reliability</b> <b>predictions</b> and calibrations of the prediction intervals (PIs). Another trends in field lifetime data is {{the availability of the}} dynamic data which give information dynamically on how a product being used and under which environment being used. Incorporating this information (historically not available) into statistical analyses will provide stronger statistical methods. In this dissertation, statistical models and methods motivated by real applications were developed for <b>reliability</b> <b>predictions</b> based on complicated data and dynamic data. In Chapter 2, left truncated and right censored high-voltage power transformer lifetime data are available from an energy company. The company wants to predict the remaining life of transformers and the cumulative number of failures at a future time for their transformer fleet. The population is nonhomogeneous because transformer designs evolved over past decades. The data were stratified into relatively homogeneous groups and regression was done to incorporate the explanatory variables. The random weighted bootstrap was used to overcome the difficulties introduced by the complicated structure of the data in the calibration of the prediction intervals. In Chapter 3, the importance of stratification when the population is nonhomogeneous was analytically studied in the context of <b>reliability</b> <b>predictions.</b> There are two potential pitfalls for fitting a single distribution to nonhomogeneous data, which are misinterpretation of the failure mode and asymptotic biasness in prediction. These results were further illustrated by the high-voltage transformer life data. In Chapter 4, data are available from a product which has four major failure modes. Use-rate information is available for units connected to the network. We use a cycles-to-failure model to compute predictions and prediction intervals for the number failing. We also present prediction methods for units not connected to the network...|$|R
50|$|To {{perform a}} proper {{quantitative}} <b>reliability</b> <b>prediction</b> for systems {{may be difficult}} and very expensive if done by testing. At the individual part-level, reliability results can often be obtained with comparatively high confidence, as testing of many sample parts might be possible using the available testing budget. However, unfortunately these tests may lack validity at a system-level due to assumptions made at part-level testing. These authors {{emphasized the importance of}} initial part- or system-level testing until failure, and to learn from such failures to improve the system or part. The general conclusion is drawn that an accurate and absolute prediction — by either field-data comparison or testing — of reliability is in most cases not possible. An exception might be failures due to wear-out problems such as fatigue failures. In the introduction of MIL-STD-785 it is written that <b>reliability</b> <b>prediction</b> should be used with great caution, if not used solely for comparison in trade-off studies.|$|E
