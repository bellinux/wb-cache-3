40|$|Most of the {{interest}} rate derivative pricing models are jump-diffusion models, where the jump risk is assumed diversifiable. In this paper, we propose a Heath-Jarrow-Morton model with systematic jump risk to derive the no-arbitrage condition using Esscher transformation. Based on the Heath-Jarrow-Morton model with systematic jump risk, the dynamic process of the LIBOR market model with systematic jump risk is then developed. By decomposing the USD knock-out <b>reversed</b> <b>swap</b> into three derivative components, i. e., interest rate swap, interest rate digital call (IRDC) and cap, the pricing of the swap {{can be obtained from}} the dynamic process of the LIBOR market model with systematic jump risk.

50|$|A swap {{agreement}} {{in which one}} party makes payments based on a set rate, either fixed or variable, while the other party makes payments based on the return of an underlying asset, which includes both the income it generates and any capital gains. In partial return <b>reverse</b> <b>swaps,</b> the underlying asset, {{referred to as the}} reference asset, is usually a stock or portfolio of stocks. The reference asset is sold to the buyer, with half (or some other percentage) of the return owned by the party receiving the agreed rate of payment, which is usually {{in the form of a}} note payable.|$|R
50|$|Partial return <b>reverse</b> <b>swaps</b> {{allow the}} selling party to gain {{liquidity}} often {{through the use}} of algorithmic trading platforms that use technologies such as Stealth Technology and volume-seeking algorithms to more efficiently manage large blocks of stock while avoiding the risks of inside information. Sellers gain liquidity and buffering against any complications with inside information. Buyers effectively are able to purchase stock at a discount to market, for a private-to-public equities arbitrage opportunity. These swaps are considered to be exotic, but are growing in popularity. Investors like swaps like this because they get the benefit of a large exposure with a minimal or no cash outlay.|$|R

They usually post a smaller amount of collateral upfront, thus obtaining leverage. The term [...] "Partial Return Reverse Swap" [...] was first used in London by Taylor Moffitt of Holydean and later in his doctoral student writings. It was first practiced by fund management companies such as Greenridge Capital, as en effort to streamline a cluster of separate transactions often used together into one derivative swap agreement.

However, how does signal binding to the extracellular domain activate the cytoplasmic kinase domain? Activation {{of the plant}} immunoreceptor Flagellin sensing 2 (FLS 2) by its bacterial ligand flagellin or the peptide-epitope flg 22 coincides with rapid complex formation with a second receptor kinase termed brassinosteroid receptor 1 associated kinase 1 (BAK 1). Here, we show that the receptor pair of FLS 2 and BAK 1 is also functional when {{the roles of the}} complex partners are <b>reversed</b> by <b>swapping</b> their cytosolic domains. This reciprocal constellation prevents interference by redundant partners that can partially substitute for BAK 1 and demonstrates that formation of the heteromeric complex is the molecular switch for transmembrane signaling. A similar approach with swaps between the Elongation factor-Tu receptor and BAK 1 also resulted in a functional receptor/coreceptor pair, suggesting that a "two-hybrid-receptor assay" is of more general use for studying heteromeric receptor complexes...|$|R

50|$|In 1959, RKO and NBC {{reached an}} {{agreement}} on {{what would have been}} the highest-priced license transfer in broadcasting history to that time. The deal would have seen RKO acquire NBC's WRC-AM-FM-TV in Washington, swap WNAC-AM-TV and WRKO-FM (the former WNAC-FM) in Boston to NBC for that company's WRCV-AM-TV in Philadelphia, and sell the WGMS stations in Washington to Crowell-Collier Broadcasting (as Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations at that time would not permit ownership of both the WRC stations and the WGMS stations). The deal was an attempt to resolve a controversy surrounding a 1956 swap of NBC and Westinghouse Broadcasting stations in Philadelphia and Cleveland. In 1965, the FCC declared the 1956 trade null and void, effectively <b>reversing</b> the <b>swap,</b> and denied the proposed license transfers on what would prove to be the ironic ground that NBC would enter the Boston market as the product of its dishonesty in the Philadelphia/Cleveland transaction. Coincidentally, RKO's former Boston TV station became an NBC affiliate in 1995 after its longtime affiliate, Westinghouse-owned WBZ-TV, switched to CBS in a precursor to that network's merger with Westinghouse, which includes the aforementioned Philadelphia stations.|$|R

40|$|The {{superfamily}} of {{eye lens}} Î²Î³-crystallins is highly modularized, with Greek key motifs {{being used to}} form symmetric domains. Sequences of monomeric Î³-crystallins and oligomeric Î²-crystallins fold into two domains that pair about a further conserved symmetric interface. Conservation of this assembly interface by domain swapping is the device adopted by family member Î²B 2 -crystallin to form a solution dimer. However, the Î²B 1 -crystallin solution dimer is formed from an interface used by the domain-swapped dimer to form a tetramer in the crystal lattice. Comparison of these two structures indicated an intriguing relationship between linker conformation, interface ion pair networks, and higher assembly. Here the X-ray structure of recombinant human Î²B 2 -crystallin showed that domain swapping {{was determined by the}} sequence and not assembly conditions. The solution characteristics of mutants that were designed to alter an ion pair network at a higher assembly interface and a mutant that changed a proline showed they remained dimeric. X-ray crystallography showed that the dimeric mutants did not <b>reverse</b> domain <b>swapping.</b> Thus, the sequence of Î²B 2 -crystallin appears well optimized for domain swapping. However, a charge-reversal mutation to the conserved domain-pairing interface showed drastic changes to solution behavior. It appears that the higher assembly of the Î²Î³-crystallin domains has exploited symmetry to create diversity while avoiding aggregation. These are desirable attributes for proteins that have to exist at very high concentration for a very long time...|$|R
50|$|Channel 4 was {{in danger}} of losing its NBC {{affiliation}} when Westinghouse balked at NBC's initial offer to trade sister stations KYW radio and WPTZ television (now KYW-TV) in Philadelphia in exchange for WTAM-AM-FM and WNBK television in Cleveland. In response, NBC threatened to pull its programming from both WBZ-TV and WPTZ unless Westinghouse agreed to the trade. The swap was made in February 1956, but Westinghouse immediately complained to the Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice about NBC's extortion. The threat reemerged in 1960 after NBC announced it would swap the Philadelphia stations in exchange for a competing Boston outlet, then-CBS affiliate WNAC-TV (channel 7) and its sister radio stations, from RKO General. Approval of the RKO-NBC deal would have potentially made WBZ-TV an ABC affiliate, completing a three-way swap of network affiliations in Boston. But in 1964 the FCC nullified the NBC-RKO trade and ordered the NBC-Westinghouse <b>swap</b> <b>reversed</b> without NBC realizing any profit on the deal.|$|R

The sale of WPRI resulted from rules enforced at the time by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that prohibited common ownership of stations in adjacent markets with overlapping signals, with no consideration for a waiver for stations with large overlapping coverage areas (WPRI's signal carried over into most of the Boston market, whereas WBZ-TV's signal covered almost all of Rhode Island).|$|R

40|$|Soot {{formation}} and flame extinction are vital {{concerns in the}} combustion of fossil fuels. In particular, soot is responsible for pollutant emissions, and extinction can cause inefficient or unstable burning. Normal-gravity experiments have demonstrated that flames can be designed to improve both characteristics by redirecting {{some or all of}} the nitrogen from the oxidizer into the fuel. Such nitrogen exchange can produce permanently blue flames, which are soot free under all possible flame conditions. Furthermore, this approach can lead to stronger, extinction-resistant flames. Past investigations of nitrogen exchange were unable to identify the physical mechanisms responsible for its benefits because these mechanisms cannot be isolated when normal-gravity flames are studied. In contrast, the Diffusion Flame Extinction and Soot Inception (DESI) experiment considers spherical flames, where nearly perfect spherical symmetry affords new levels of control. Because of buoyancy, spherical flames cannot be created in Earth s gravity. DESI was conceived by principal investigator Professor R. L. Axelbaum of Washington University in St. Louis. Tests to date have utilized the 2. 2 -Second Drop Tower at the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field. The experiment is slated for testing aboard the International Space Station in a few years. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the connection between nitrogen exchange and permanently blue flames. These are the structure (chemical effects) and hydrodynamics (flow direction and speed). In normal-gravity flames, the structure and hydrodynamics are coupled, since nitrogen exchange simultaneously modifies both. Spherical microgravity flames, on the other hand, allow independent control of these factors. Specifically, structure can be modified via nitrogen exchange, and flow direction can be <b>reversed</b> by <b>swapping</b> the ambient and burner-feed gases. In DESI, these variations can be accomplished without changing the theoretical flame temperature...|$|R

The human pandemic influenza viruses that emerged in 1957 and 1968 as well as swine viruses circulating since 1998 encode PB 1 segments derived from avian influenza viruses. Here we investigate the possible role in viral replication and virulence of the PB 1 gene segments present in two swine H 1 N 2 influenza A viruses, A/swine/Sweden/ 1021 / 2009 (H 1 N 2) (sw 1021) and A/swine/Sweden/ 9706 / 2010 (H 1 N 2) (sw 9706), where the sw 1021 virus has shown to be more pathogenic in mice. By using <b>reverse</b> genetics, we <b>swapped</b> the PB 1 genes of these two viruses. Similar to the sw 9706 virus, chimeric sw 1021 virus carrying the sw 9706 PB 1 gene was not virulent in mice. In contrast, replacement of the PB 1 gene of the sw 9706 virus by that from sw 1021 virus resulted in increased pathogenicity. Our study demonstrated that differences in virulence of swine influenza virus subtype H 1 N 2 are attributed at least in part to the PB 1 segment...|$|R
