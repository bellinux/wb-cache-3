5|$|The 2012 book <b>Rising</b> <b>Above</b> <b>the</b> Gathering Storm by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine {{noted the}} White House Astronomy Night {{indicated}} an emphasis by the Obama Administration towards support {{for education in}} the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM fields). The New Moon: Water, Exploration, and Future Habitation, written in 2014 by Arlin Crotts, observed this event and the inclusion of NASA's Lunar Electric Rover in the First inauguration of Barack Obama reflected an emphasis on the importance of science education.|$|E
5|$|The concept, which {{originated}} in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, was {{to remove the}} reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be multiple rings of defensive walls, one inside the other, with the inner ring <b>rising</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If assailants made it past {{the first line of}} defence they would be caught in the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall.|$|E
5|$|Flight 1 {{crashed into}} Pumpkin Patch Channel, Jamaica Bay, at 10:08:49, while angled at 78 degrees {{and on a}} {{magnetic}} heading of 300 degrees. Passengers aboard a Mohawk Airlines plane bound for Albany that took off immediately after Flight 1 watched the plane plunge into the bay. The jet exploded upon impact, a geyser of brackish water and black smoke erupted from the site, and the scattered debris and fuel caught fire. Long Island residents described hearing explosions which shook the foundations of nearby houses, though {{no one on the}} ground is known to have witnessed the plane hitting the swamp. However, a few men at Naval Air Station New York / Floyd Bennett Field saw the massive geyser of water <b>rising</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> hangars, and one guard—at his post on a bridge that the plane flew over—saw the plane roll over.|$|E

5|$|Sculpturing is seen {{on many of}} {{the skull}} bones, in the form of long grooves, pits and protrusions. Like other ceratosaurs, the frontal bones of the skull roof were fused together. Carnotaurines {{commonly}} had bony projections from the skull. Carnotaurus had two pronounced horns, projecting outward above the eyes, while its close relative Aucasaurus had smaller projections in the same area. Majungasaurus and Rajasaurus had a single bony horn or dome, projecting upwards from the skull. These projections, like the horns of many modern animals, might have been displayed for species recognition or intimidation. In Arcovenator, the dorsal margin of the postorbital (and probably also the lacrimal) is thickened dorsolaterally, forming a strong and rugose bony brow ridge <b>rising</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> level of the skull roof. Maybe this rugose brow ridge supported a keratinous or scaly structure for displays.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 book <b>Rising</b> <b>Above</b> <b>the</b> Gathering Storm by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine {{cited the}} fact that the Obama Administration hosted the first White House Astronomy Night, as a {{reflection}} of the President's support for education in the STEM fields. The 2014 book The New Moon: Water, Exploration, and Future Habitation by Arlin Crotts discussed the appreciation of the importance of science education by the Obama Administration, citing the White House Astronomy Night and the inclusion of NASA's Lunar Electric Rover in the First inauguration of Barack Obama as key examples. Sally Ride: America's First Woman in Space, a 2015 biography of the astronaut by Lynn Sherr, discussed Ride's attendance at the 2009 White House Astronomy Night and commented that she enjoyed speaking with youngsters about the possibility of humans visiting Mars in the future.|$|E
5|$|Antananarivo {{was founded}} from about 1610 to 1625, when the Merina king Andrianjaka (1612–1630) {{expelled}} the Vazimba {{inhabitants of the}} village of Analamanga at the highest meeting point of two forested ridges <b>rising</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> surrounding highland plains. Declaring it the site of his capital, Andrianjaka built a rova (fortified royal dwelling) that expanded to become the royal palaces of the Kingdom of Imerina. According to oral history, he deployed a garrison of 1,000 soldiers to capture and guard the site; the hill and its city retained the name Analamanga until the reign of King Andriamasinavalona (1675–1710), who renamed it Antananarivo ("City of the Thousand") in honor of Andrianjaka's soldiers. The city served as {{the capital of the}} Kingdom of Imerina from its founding until 1710, when Imerina split into four warring quadrants. Antananarivo was declared the capital of the southern quadrant; it remained thus until King Andrianampoinimerina of Ambohimanga captured the province and restored its role as capital of a united Kingdom of Imerina in 1794. His diplomatic and military successes extended Imerina far beyond its traditional borders, bringing the lands of neighboring ethnic groups under Merina control. These conquests were continued under his son, Radama I, whose control ultimately extended over two thirds of the island, leading him to be considered the King of Madagascar by European diplomats, with Antananarivo as the island's capital. Antananarivo remained the island's capital after Madagascar was colonized by the French in 1897 and remained thus after independence in 1960.|$|E

5|$|The 12th Battalion is {{unexpectedly}} attacked {{soon after}} by Intelligent Defense Systems, a private military contractor that had secretly supported first the Lazurians, then the NRA by supplying them with {{weapons of mass}} destruction. Dr. Caulder, leader of the IDS, had taken advantage of the world's devastation to carry out horrific biological and psychological experiments that he would have been unable to undertake otherwise, such as creating and spreading a terrible new disease called the Creeper, which causes flowers to bloom from infected individuals, {{for the sole purpose of}} studying the survivor's reactions. Despite numerous demoralizing attacks by IDS and its massive bomber, the Great Owl, the battalion survives and infiltrates and brings down The Great Owl, eventually pursuing Caulder to his main laboratory and fortress, The Nest. In the end, Caulder is killed in the destruction of his lab, and the war is finally brought to an end. One year later, the village of New Hope, founded by the 12th Battalion after the conflict, begins to flourish in the new-found peace. The sun is seen <b>rising</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> nearby hills for the first time since the meteor strikes, giving hope of a brighter future.|$|E

25|$|Planing wood {{along its}} side grain {{should result in}} thin {{shavings}} <b>rising</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> surface of the wood as {{the edge of the}} plane iron is pushed forward, leaving a smooth surface, but sometimes splintering occurs. This is largely a matter of cutting with the grain or against the grain respectively, referring to the side grain of the piece of wood being worked.|$|E
25|$|The tower {{itself is}} a replica of Helen's Tower at Clandeboye, County Down. It was at Helen's Tower that {{the men of the}} then newly formed Ulster Division drilled and trained on the {{outbreak}} of World War I. For many of the men of the 36th (Ulster) Division, the distinctive sight of Helen's Tower <b>rising</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> surrounding countryside was one of their last abiding memories of home before their departure for England and, subsequently, the Western Front.|$|E
25|$|The Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus (1798) {{used the}} concept of {{diminishing}} returns to explain low living standards. Human population, he argued, tended to increase geometrically, outstripping the production of food, which increased arithmetically. The force of a rapidly growing population against {{a limited amount of}} land meant diminishing returns to labour. The result, he claimed, was chronically low wages, which prevented the standard of living for most of the population from <b>rising</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> subsistence level. Economist Julian Lincoln Simon has criticized Malthus's conclusions.|$|E

25|$|Goltz {{was born}} in , East Prussia (later renamed Goltzhausen; now Ivanovka, in Polessky District, Kaliningrad Oblast), into an impoverished noble family. He grew up at the manor house of Fabiansfelde near Preußisch Eylau, which had been bought by his father in 1844. His father spent some {{nineteen}} years in the Prussian Army without <b>rising</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> rank of lieutenant, and his efforts at farming were similarly unfruitful, and he eventually succumbed to cholera while {{on a trip to}} Danzig (now Gdańsk) when Colmar was six years old.|$|E
25|$|The resort was {{designed}} to provide a vacation spot for the US service members and their families. It is a retreat for military personnel of all ranks, their families and their guests. The resort offers discounted prices for hotel rooms and discounts on theme park tickets. The resort's motto is Serving Those Who Serve. Specific eligibility must be met before making a reservation. As guests enter Shades of Green, there are five service flags framing an immense rock formation with five waterfalls, each a tribute to the five branches of military service. <b>Rising</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> setting is a larger American flag and a smaller POW/MIA flag.|$|E
25|$|Some {{designs of}} dress shoes {{can be worn}} by either gender. The {{majority}} of dress shoes have an upper covering, commonly made of leather, enclosing most of the lower foot, but not covering the ankles. This {{upper part of the}} shoe is often made without apertures or openings, but may also be made with openings or even itself consist of a series of straps, e.g. an open toe featured in women's shoes. Shoes with uppers made high to cover the ankles are also available; a shoe with the upper <b>rising</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> ankle is usually considered a boot but certain styles may be referred to as high-topped shoes or high-tops. Usually, a high-topped shoe is secured by laces or zippers, although some styles have elastic inserts to ease slipping the shoe on.|$|E
