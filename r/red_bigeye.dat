The wild seedstock normally used by farmers are past this early aggressive stage. When cultured in Vietnam, lobsters are normally fed “trash” fish, such as lizardfish, <b>red</b> <b>bigeye,</b> and ponyfish, that are caught as a by-product of fishing activities and fishery offal from the cleaning and processing of commercial fishery species. They are also fed mollusk such as sea snails, oysters, and cockles etc. (11). These raw foods are given to the lobsters in the cages after being chopped into small pieces, and the mollusk shells are often removed for the younger lobsters.|$|E
