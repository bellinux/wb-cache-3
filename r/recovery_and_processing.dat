30|$|Split variational inequality, {{which was}} {{introduced}} by Censor et al. in [36], {{can be regarded as}} a generalization of variational inequality and includes as a special case, the split feasibility problem, which is an important model {{for a wide range of}} practical problems arising from signal <b>recovery,</b> image <b>processing,</b> <b>and</b> tensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning (see, for example, [37 – 41]). Thus, the concepts of well-posedness and Levitin-Polyak well-posedness for various split variational inequalities were studied by Hu and Fang recently [42]. Obviously, split hemivariational inequality could be regarded as a generalization of split variational inequality. It could arise in a system of hemivariational inequalities for modeling some frictional contact problems in mechanics, where two hemivariational inequalities are linked by a linear constraint. Also, when nonconvex and nonsmooth functionals are involved, the model for the above mentioned practical problems, such as signal <b>recovery</b> <b>and</b> image <b>processing,</b> turns to split hemivariational inequality rather than split variational inequality. However, as far as we know, there are few research works studying well-posedness for split hemivariational inequalities.|$|R

The problem of finding a point in the intersection of these convex subsets is then of crucial interest, and it cannot be usually solved directly.

Compared with the state-of-the-art, our algorithm addresses limitations in uneven shadow boundary <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> umbra <b>recovery.</b> We first detect an initial shadow boundary by growing a user specified shadow outline on an illumination-sensitive image. Interval-variable intensity sampling is introduced to avoid artefacts raised from uneven boundaries. We extract the initial scale field by applying local group intensity spline fittings around the shadow boundary. Bad intensity samples {{are replaced by}} their nearest alternatives based on a log-normal probability distribution of fitting errors. Finally, we use a gradual colour transfer to correct post-processing artefacts such as gamma correction and lossy compression. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, we offer highly user-friendly interaction, produce improved umbra <b>recovery</b> <b>and</b> improved <b>processing</b> given uneven shadow boundaries...|$|R
