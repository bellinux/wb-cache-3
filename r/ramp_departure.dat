The process that generates the ripples is poorly understood, because the large gradients at the shock ramp make it difficult to identify instabilities.

50|$|Terminal D is {{the main}} {{international}} departures and arrivals facility. It {{has been designed to}} support an integrated system for monitoring and directing arriving and departing passengers; this has been ensured by implementing a scheme of movement based on the principle of multi-level zoning — departing passengers use the airport's upper floors, whilst those arriving and yet to pass through immigration are processed on a lower level. The ground and first floors are used for airside service and the sorting of baggage. Airside, the first floor is used for arrivals zone and baggage hall. The fourth floor is reserved for airlines' lounges. The terminal can be accessed from the airport's central access road for arrivals and in the same way but via a <b>ramp</b> for <b>departures</b> level.|$|R
50|$|During the 2010 Chile earthquake, the {{passenger}} terminal building suffered internal damages {{and the collapse}} of a pedestrian bridge between the vehicle <b>ramp</b> and the <b>departures</b> area. Nevertheless, both runways and control tower were unharmed, allowing the realization of a massive humanitarian air-bridge held by the Chilean Air Force to Concepción, Chile (Carriel Sur International Airport), close to the most damaged area by this earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The airport authority had closed off all commercial flight operations after around 1200 UTC on February 27, resuming full operations on March 3, 2010.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the Tu-144 into passenger service was timed to the 60th anniversary of the Communist revolution, as was duly noted in Soviet officials' speeches delivered at the airport before the inaugural flight - whether the aircraft was actually ready for passenger service was deemed of secondary importance. Even the outward details of the inaugural Tu-144 flight betrayed the haste of its introduction into service: several ceiling panels were ajar, service trays stuck, window shades dropped without being pulled, reading lights did not work, not all toilets worked and a broken <b>ramp</b> delayed <b>departure</b> half an hour. On arrival to Alma-Ata, the Tu-144 was towed {{back and forth for}} 25 minutes before it could be aligned with the exit ramp. Equally telling is the number of hours spent on flight testing. Whereas Concorde had been subjected to 5,000 hours of testing {{by the time it was}} certified for passenger flight, making it the most tested aircraft ever, total flight testing time of the Tu-144 by the time of its introduction into passenger service was less than 800 hours. Flight testing time logged on the prototype (68001) was 180 hours; flight testing time for the Tu-144S until the completion of state acceptance tests was 408 hours; service tests until the commencement of passenger service were 96 hours of flight time; altogether totalling 756 hours. It is unclear why the Minister of Aviation Industry and the Minister of Civil Aviation did not endorse the protocols of state acceptance tests for four months after the tests completion. One reason could be the change of the guard - Minister Dementiev, who was one of the chief backers of Tu-144, died a day before the tests completed - but it might also had something to do with aircraft reliability record uncovered during the tests that was no better than the subsequent dismal service record.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} application of a limited priority gap acceptance model to freeway merging. In the limited priority model, drivers in the major stream at a merge area may incur delay in restoring small headways to a larger, sustainable minimum headway {{between them and the}} vehicle in front. This allows minor stream drivers to accept smaller gaps. The headway distributions are assumed to be distributed according to Cowan’s M 3 model, whose terms were calibrated for this system. Minor stream minimum follow-on time was calibrated, and a realistic range of the critical gap identified. An equation was developed for minimum average minor stream delay. A function was identified to model the relationship between minor stream average delay and degree of saturation. The shape parameter of this function was calibrated using simulated traffic flow data, under three different minor stream arrival pattern regimes. The model provides a useful means of comparing performance, through average minor stream delay, for varying minor and major stream flow rates and minor stream critical gap, under arrival patterns that differ due to traffic control upstream of the on-ramp. Minor stream delay is a particularly useful measure of effectiveness for uncongested freeway merging as it relates directly to the distance required to merge. Observations from the model developed provide physical evidence that minor stream drivers incur lesser delay, or {{have a better chance of}} merging quickly, when they arrive at constant intervals as is the case under constant <b>departure</b> <b>ramp</b> metering, than when they arrive in bunches downstream of a signalised intersection, or even a semi-bunched state downstream of an unsignalised intersection...|$|R
