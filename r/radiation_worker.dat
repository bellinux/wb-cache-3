40|$|Background: The {{workforce}} of the UK Atomic Energy Authority {{has been}} the subject of several previous epidemiological investigations. Aims: To detect and investigate associations between mortality rates and employment in a substantially increased cohort size and follow up extended to 1997. Methods and Results: The new cohort included 51 367 employees, of whom 10 249 were dead. Mortality rates for all workers were low compared to national rates, as were rates in <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> and for workers monitored for internal contamination. For <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> all cause mortality and all cancer mortality were significantly lower than for non-radiation workers. There was no overall trend of increasing mortality with radiation dose. There was little evidence of raised mortality from leukaemia. The association of prostatic cancer with radiation dose was much less significant than in previous reports. However, the relatively high mortality from uterine cancers among <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> remained, though the numbers were very small. The association was with endometrial rather than cervical cancer. Mortality from cancer of the pleura was high among <b>radiation</b> <b>workers,</b> but was not correlated with dose. Conclusion: Overall, <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> at UKAEA showed no excess mortality. The previously detected association of prostate cancer with high radiation dose may have been a statistical artefact or a risk associated with discontinued activities. Endometrial cancer occurred at higher rates in female <b>radiation</b> <b>workers,</b> but, because there was no correlation with dose, may well be due to something other than their radiation exposure. Cancer of the pleura in <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> was almost certainly related to past asbestos exposure. <br/...|$|R

Materials and Methods Blood samples from 46 <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> were analyzed in Golestan province, Iran. Meanwhile, two groups of blood samples (five blood samples in each group) were irradiated in vitro by doses of 1 to 0. 2 Gy and 0. 09 to 0. 01 Gy from a 60 Co source, respectively. γH 2 AX level in lymphocytes was measured, using Western blot technique.

40|$|Background and Objective: Professional <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> are occupationally {{exposed to}} {{long-term}} {{low levels of}} ionizing radiation. Occupational health hazards from radiation exposure, in a large occupational segment of the population, are of special concern. Biological dosimetry can be performed in addition to physical dosimetry {{with the aim of}} individual dose assessment and biological effects. Methods: In this biodosimetry study, some hematological parameters have been examined in 40 exposed and 40 control subjects who were matched by gender, age and occupational records (± 3 years) in Kermanshah hospitals in Iran (2013 - 2014). The occupational radiation dose was measured by personal dosimetry device (film badges). The data was analyzed using SPSS V. 20 and statistical tests such as two-sided Student’s t-test. Results: Exposed subjects had a median exposure of 0. 68 ± 1. 58 mSv/year by film badge dosimetry. <b>Radiation</b> <b>workers</b> with at least a 10 -year record showed lower values of Mean Hemoglobin (Hb) and Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) compared to the control group (p< 0. 05).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to perform {{cytogenetic}} analysis by means of a semi-automated micronucleus-centromere assay in lymphocytes from medical <b>radiation</b> <b>workers.</b> Two groups of workers receiving the highest occupational doses were selected: 10 nuclear medicine technicians and 10 interventional radiologists/cardiologists. Centromere-negative micronucleus (MNCM-) data, obtained from these two groups of medical <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> were compared with those obtained in matched controls. The blood samples of the matched controls were additionally used to construct a 'low-dose' (0 - 100 mGy) MNCM-dose-response curve to evaluate the sensitivity and suitability of the micronucleus-centromere assay as an 'effect' biomarker in medical surveillance programs. The physical dosimetry data of the 3 years preceding the blood sampling, based on single or double dosimetry practices, were collected for the interpretation of the micronucleus data. The in vitro radiation results showed that for small sized groups, semi-automated scoring of MNCM-enables the detection of a dose of 50 mGy. The comparison of MNCM-yields in medical <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> and control individuals showed enhanced MNCM-scores in the medical <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> group (P= 0. 15). The highest MNCM-scores were obtained in the interventional radiologists/cardiologists group, and these scores were significantly higher compared with those obtained from the matched control group (P= 0. 05). The higher MNCM-scores observed in interventional radiologists/cardiologists compared with nuclear medicine technicians were not in agreement with the personal dosimetry records in both groups, which may point to the limitation of 'double dosimetry' procedures used in interventional radiology/cardiology.

40|$|AbstractBackground {{and purpose}} : It is clearly shown that {{ionising}} radiations induce {{various kinds of}} DNA damages majority of which as sub-lethal damages, are repaired but still {{some of them are}} left urepaired and lead to chromosomal aberrations. These chromosomal aberrations in <b>radiation</b> <b>workers,</b> who are occupationally exposed to radiation,could be assayed with cytogenetic evaluation methods. These cytogenetic assessments are good indicators for evaluating the health of <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> as well as radiation protection quality in medical radiation centers. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the frequency of the chromosomal aberrations using analysis of metaphase method in <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> of radiology departments in Babol. Materials and methods :. Heparinized venous blood samples were prepared from 62 radiology workers and 29 individuals as control population whose duties did not expose them to radiation sources. Lymphocytes were cultured in culture medium consisting of RPMI- 1640 supplemented with L-glutamine, 15 % fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics. PHA at a concentration of 5 µg/ml was used to stimulate division of lymphocytes in culture. Blood cultures were incubated at 37 oC for 48 hours and 2 hours prior to harvesting; colcemid was added to cultures at a final concentration of 0. 1 µg/ml to arrest the dividing lymphocytes in mitosis. At hour 50 the cells were collected, washed and fixed on the slides followed by staining. One hundred mitoses were analyzed for each sample and chromosomal aberrations were scored and statistically analyzed. Results : Results showed that the mean frequencies of the total chromosomal aberrations in <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> is significantly higher than controls (p= 0. 014). It was also shown that there is no significant correlation between the frequency of chromosomal aberration and age, sex and smoking of individuals in both groups. Also no significant correlation was noted between the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> and the years of work as well as history of over dose. Conclusion : The higher frequency of chromosomal aberration in lymphocytes of <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> compared to non exposed controls is in full agreement with other reports and could be due to the accumulative effect of radiation induced initial DNA damage in individuals exposed to chronic and low doses of radiation which, finally leads to detectable chromosomal aberrations.

Mortality data not specifically related to radiation workers are included and relate to male deaths among serving staff and pensioners during the years 1962 - 1978. Those observed deaths (O) are compared on an age standardized basis with those expected (E) from the general population, the ratio O/E being about 1 for all cancers and less than 1 for non-cancer deaths. This pattern is consistent with the well known 'healthy worker' effect seen in industry...|$|E
40|$|The public {{expects that}} the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) will {{operate in a}} manner that {{prevents}} negative impacts to the environment and protects the safety and health of its employees and the public. To achieve this goal within budget, the Department of Energy (DOE) and LANL must develop new and improved environment, safety, and health (ES and H) technologies and implement innovative, more cost-effective ES and H approaches to operations. In FY 95, the Environment, Safety, and Health (ESH) Division initiated a Technology Development, Evaluation, and Application (TDEA) program. The purpose of this unique program is to test and develop technologies that solve LANL ES and H problems and improve the safety of LANL operations. This progress report presents the results of 10 projects funded in FY 97 by the TDEA Committee of the Environment, Safety, and Health Division. Products generated from the projects funded in FY 97 included implementation of <b>radiation</b> <b>worker</b> dosimetric monitoring systems (two); evaluation and validation of cost-effective animal-tracking systems for environmental studies (two); evaluation of personal protective equipment (two); and development of a method for optimal placement of continuous air monitors in the workplace...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Analysis of {{absorbed dose}} in vital organs of {{radiation}} workers at Industrial Radioisotope Dept. and Radio-pharmaceutical production line (Tc- 99 m) {{with the use}} of RANDO phantom and TLD method. Materials and Methods: This article examines the experimental simulation method of Gamma-rays'- absorbed dose in &micro;Sv in the eye cornea, thyroid and testicles measured {{with the use of}} a RANDO phantom and the employment of TLD 100 H (Li:Mg:P:Cu) dosimeters and a model 4500 reader, made by Harshaw, an American manufacture. The simulation method was performed on pre-determined parts in both normal and emergency conditions. Results and Conclusion: The result of this research indicates that the level of absorbed dose in various body parts of radiation workers in ordinary work conditions in controlled areas is less than the allowable absorbed dose. Moreover, despite the fact that the irradiation level for the whole body and different body parts are being 10 times more in restricted and prohibited areas, the absorbed dose is also measured to be less than the allowable dose. However, number of incidences such as human error in charging the gamma cameras in Industrial radio isotope department can cause the whole body irradiation of a <b>radiation</b> <b>worker</b> to exceed the allowable dose of 20 msv per year...|$|E

The annual, whole-body dose currently permitted to <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> in the United States is 5 rem; Steven's annual dose was approximately 60 times this amount.|$|R
40|$|BATAN Serpong Radioisotopes and Radiopharmaceuticals Technology Center (PTRR) is a {{business}} unit conducting utilization of nuclear energy in thefields of radioisotope and radiopharmaceutical. This work unit has <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> who potentially recieve a radiation dose in a certain amount. The radiation dose which is received by <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> {{may be caused by}} their behaviour when working because the behaviour {{is a reflection of the}} knowledge, attitudes, and practices of a person. The purpose of this study was to analyze there is any relationship between knowledge, attitudes, and practices which related to radiation protection principles, and their relation to the radiation doses which received by workers in PTRR BATAN Serpong. This study was a quantitative design in the form of a explanatory cross sectional. The samples in this study was 52 <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> of Radioisotopes, Radiopharmaceuticals, as well as Occupational Safety and Waste Management were selected based on purposive sampling technique. Data analysis used Spearman Rank test with a level of 95 %. The results showed that the knowledge, attitude, and practice of radioation workers in PTRR BATAN Serpong classified as good, and the radiation dose which received by workers was still below the dose limit value. Statistical analysis showed that knowledge of radiation protection principles related to the radiation dose with weak and negative relationship (p-value = 0, 017, ρ= - 0, 331), and practices of radiation protection principles related to the radiation dose with strong and negative relationship (p-value = 0, 001, ρ= - 0, 521). Menwhile, attitudes of radiation protection principles did not related with radiation dose (p-value = 0, 774). We recommended that the management give reward and punishment to <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> which related to radiation protection principles...|$|R

A total of 367 medical <b>radiation</b> <b>workers</b> were monitored, comprising 27 % radiologists, 2 % oncologists, 4 % dentists, 5 % physicists, 45 % technologists, 4 % nurses, 3 % film processor technicians, 4 % auxiliary staff, and 5 % radiology office staff. The average annual effective dose for all subjects ranged from 1. 19 to 2. 52 mSv. Among these workers, technologists received the largest annual effective dose. The study forms the initiation stage of wider, comprehensive and more frequent monitoring of occupational radiation exposures and long-term investigations into its accumulation patterns, which could form the basis of future records on the detrimental effects of <b>radiation,</b> characteristic of <b>workers</b> in the medical sector, and other co-factors in a developing country such as Kenya...|$|R
