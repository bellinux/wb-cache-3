5|$|Images 4 and 5 assume an {{overhead}} stream {{that is totally}} condensed into a liquid product using water or air-cooling. However, in many cases, the tower overhead is not easily condensed totally and the <b>reflux</b> drum must include a vent gas outlet stream. In yet other cases, the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam is injected into the distillation tower (which {{is the case in}} the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the <b>reflux</b> drum may contain a condensed liquid distillate phase, a condensed water phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes it necessary that the <b>reflux</b> drum also have a water outlet stream.|$|E
5|$|A {{predisposition}} for bladder infections may run in families. Other {{risk factors}} include diabetes, being uncircumcised, {{and having a}} large prostate. In children UTIs are associated with vesicoureteral <b>reflux</b> (an abnormal movement of urine from the bladder into ureters or kidneys) and constipation.|$|E
5|$|Manual {{squeezing}} {{and releasing}} – the examiner can compress the vein below the probe which will push {{the blood in}} its normal anterograde direction. On releasing the pressure if the valves are incompetent the flow will appear as a retrograde flow or <b>reflux,</b> greater than 0.5 sec.|$|E
40|$|An easy {{method to}} prepare carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{has been demonstrated}} using a two-step <b>refluxing</b> and calcination process. First, a readily available inorganic salt, Ni(NO 3) 2 &#x 22 C 5; 6 H 2 O, used as the catalyst precursor was dissolved in the high-boiling-point organic solvents (alcohols or polyhydric alcohol) by <b>refluxing</b> at 190 &#x 2218;C for 3 hours. After <b>refluxing,</b> NiO nanoparticles obtained in the solution act as the catalyst, and the organic <b>refluxing</b> solvents are used as the carbon source {{for the growth of}} CNTs. Second, CNTs are prepared by calcining the <b>refluxed</b> solution at 800 &#x 2218;C in an N 2 atmosphere for 3 hours. Results show that CNT growth possibly originates from carbon rings, with the nanotube walls growing perpendicular to these rings and forming a closed tube at the end...|$|R
50|$|The ureteroenteric {{anastomosis}} can {{be created}} {{in a number of}} different ways. There is the option of a <b>refluxing</b> or a non-refluxing type, and the two ureters can be joined into the intestinal segment either together or separately. The non-refluxing type has been associated with higher incidence of ureteroenteric anastomosis stricture, and there is doubt whether it has any advantages over the <b>refluxing</b> type. Therefore, many surgeons prefer the <b>refluxing</b> type which is simpler and apparently carries a lesser degree of complications.|$|R

30|$|Acid {{hydrolysis}} using concentrated HCl and TFA (25 °C/reflux) {{also failed}} to yield any acid. <b>Refluxing</b> with KOH and ethanol led to decarboxylation due to higher <b>refluxing</b> temperature (around 80 °C).

40|$|Indole- 2 -carboxylates are <b>refluxed</b> with {{hydrazine}} hydrate to form 5 -substituted- 3 -phenylindole- 2 -carboxyhydrazides. These are again converted to corresponding indole- 2 -carboxyazides. Azides are further converted into carbamates and finally these carbamates are cyclized {{to form the}} respective substituted 6 H, 11 H-indolo [3, 2 -C] isoquinolin- 2 -ones (1 a–c). These (1 a–c) were reacted with phosphorus pentasulfide in <b>refluxing</b> pyridine to yield the respective thiones (2 a–c). These thiones (2 a–c) on reaction with chloroacetic acid and sodium acetate in acetic acid under <b>refluxing</b> temperature for 5  h yielded isoquinoline-thioacetic acids (3 a–c).

40|$|An {{interpretation}} of specific heat data for Pittsburgh No. 8 coal <b>refluxed</b> in chlorobenzene for varying time {{in terms of}} a two-component Einstein model is given. It is shown that in the initial stages of <b>refluxing</b> (up to 8 days) there is increased macromolecular association in the bedding plane of the coal but that further <b>refluxing</b> leads to macromolecular association perpendicular to the bedding plane. Second-order phase transitions in the coal are also observed, and the variation of Einstein temperatures below and above these transitions are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Attention will {{be focused}} on the {{direction}} of the blood flow in both of the venous systems, and in the perforator veins, as well as being focused on shunt detection. A shunting of blood from the thigh veins back into the lower leg veins will give a <b>reflux</b> situation. The veins most often found to be incompetent are the saphenous veins and the perforators communicating with the deep veins of the thigh.|$|E
5|$|Changing the <b>reflux</b> (in {{combination}} {{with changes in}} feed and product withdrawal) {{can also be used}} to improve the separation properties of a continuous distillation column while in operation (in contrast to adding plates or trays, or changing the packing, which would, at a minimum, require quite significant downtime).|$|E
5|$|Children {{may have}} {{behaviors}} that are easily mistaken for epileptic seizures but are not. These include breath-holding spells, bed wetting, night terrors, tics and shudder attacks.

40|$|A new {{phenomenon}} of enhancing the relativistic transparency of overdense plasmas by {{the influence of}} hot-electron <b>refluxing</b> has been found via particle-in-cell simulations. When a p-polarized laser pulse, with intensity below the self-induced-transparency (SIT) threshold, obliquely irradiates a thin overdense plasma, the initially opaque plasma would become transparent after a time interval which linearly relies on {{the thickness of the}} plasma. This phenomenon can be interpreted by the influence of hot-electron <b>refluxing.</b> As the laser intensity is higher than the SIT threshold, the penetration velocity of the laser in the plasma is enhanced when the <b>refluxing</b> is presented. Simulation data with ion motion considered is also consistent with the assumption that hot-electron <b>refluxing</b> enhances transparency. These results have potential applications in laser shaping.

40|$|The exact {{solutions}} for the isotopic compositions and the concentrations of the two-reservoir model for mantle-crust evolution are given for arbitrary rates of crustal growth and of back flow to the mantle. The critical parameters are the chemical fractionation factors for crustal growth and <b>refluxing</b> and the integrated fractional mass-removal rates from the crust and the mantle. For the case where <b>refluxing</b> is proportional to crustal growth, all the solutions reduce to simple analytic expressions. The expression for {{the mean age of}} the mass of the crust with <b>refluxing</b> is given. If <b>refluxing</b> is significant, the model shows that highly incompatible elements have short residence times in the mantle. With plausible concentration values, material balance implies that the continents were derived from only a small fraction of the mantle...|$|R
40|$|Ni 0. 5 Zn 0. 5 Fe 2 O 4 {{nanoparticles}} were synthesized by {{thermal decomposition}} method. The influence of reaction {{conditions such as}} the amount of the surfactant, <b>refluxing</b> temperature and time on the size, morphology and dispersibility was investigated. The structure, morphology and magnetic properties of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction(XRD), transmission electron microscopy(TEM) and vibrating sample magnetometry(VSM). The results indicate that increasing the amount of the surfactant is beneficial to obtain samples with smaller particle size and better dispersibility, and the improving <b>refluxing</b> temperature and extending <b>refluxing</b> time is beneficial to obtain samples with larger particle size, but with wider size distribution. The saturation magnetization of the sample is determined to be 49. 38 A&# 183;m 2 /kg, coercivity is 7143. 20 A/m and remanent magnetization is 5. 76 A&# 183;m 2 /kg with ferrimagnetic behavior at room temperature when the reaction condition is determined as follows, the amount of TOPO is 0. 6 mmol, the <b>refluxing</b> temperature is 260 ℃ and the <b>refluxing</b> time is 1 h...|$|R
5|$|Esophageal strictures {{are usually}} benign and {{typically}} develop after {{a person has}} had <b>reflux</b> for many years. Other strictures may include esophageal webs (which can also be congenital) and damage to the esophagus by radiotherapy, corrosive ingestion, or eosinophilic esophagitis. A Schatzki ring is fibrosis at the gastro-esophageal junction. Strictures may also develop in chronic anemia, and Plummer-Vinson syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Flexing {{the toes}} and feet and {{extending}} on tiptoes, {{can all be}} very useful in detecting perforator vein incompetence. These movements unleash a muscle contraction which compresses deep veins. If a perforator valve is incompetent then a <b>reflux</b> from the deep to the superficial through the perforator vein will be registered.|$|E
5|$|The lower esophageal sphincter, or {{gastroesophageal}} sphincter, {{surrounds the}} lower part of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach. It is also called the cardiac sphincter or cardioesophageal sphincter, named from the adjacent part of the stomach, the cardia. Dysfunction of the gastroesophageal sphincter causes gastroesophageal , which causes heartburn and if it happens often enough, can lead to gastroesophageal <b>reflux</b> disease, with damage of the esophageal mucosa.|$|E
50|$|Shvo's {{catalyst}} {{is typically}} synthesized using tetracyclone and triruthenium dodecacarbonyl, which are <b>refluxed</b> {{together in a}} dry aromatic solvent such as toluene for at least 2 days.

30|$|Catalyst recovery: After {{completion}} of reaction, the entire pitch was separated into two parts, i.e., upper and lower, which establish {{the heterogeneity of}} the system. The high-density catalysts were settled down {{in the form of}} black-colored solid mass in the lower part of glass reactor. For catalyst recovery from black-colored solid mass, <b>refluxing</b> is used with ethanol at 50  °C. After <b>refluxing,</b> ethanol is separated from transition metal catalyst by distillation. However, in case of Cr, above <b>refluxed</b> method is not used because Cr is insoluble in ethanol. So, there is a problem for recovery of this catalyst.|$|R

5|$|The stomach {{produces}} gastric acid, {{a strongly}} acidic mixture consisting of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and potassium and sodium salts to enable food digestion. Constriction {{of the upper}} and lower esophageal sphincters help to prevent <b>reflux</b> (backflow) of gastric contents and acid into the esophagus, protecting the esophageal mucosa. In addition, the acute angle of His and the lower crura of the diaphragm helps this sphincteric action.|$|E
5|$|Venous {{insufficiency}} {{results when}} the vein dilates secondary to a vein wall disease or when normal {{functioning of the}} valves, which serve to keep blood flowing to the heart and to prevent <b>reflux,</b> become damaged and/or incompetent (the dilation of a vein will prevent valves to close properly). This incompetence will result in an reversed blood flow through the affected vein or veins. In varicose veins the valves are damaged, disfunction or missing and the insufficiency will be chronic. The reversed blood pools in the low third of legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} is diagnosed {{based on a}} complete history of the individual. Costly and invasive studies such as gastroduodenal manometry and esophageal Ph testing are unnecessary and will often aid in misdiagnosis. Based on typical observed features, several criteria have been suggested for diagnosing rumination syndrome. The primary symptom, the regurgitation of recently ingested food, must be consistent, occurring for at least sixweeks of the past twelve months. The regurgitation must begin within 30minutes of {{the completion of a}} meal. Patients may either chew the regurgitated matter or expel it. The symptoms must stop within 90minutes, or when the regurgitated matter becomes acidic. The symptoms must not be the result of a mechanical obstruction, and should not respond to the standard treatment for gastroesophageal <b>reflux</b> disease.|$|E

5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of <b>reflux,</b> where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of acid <b>reflux</b> disease (GERD – gastroesphogeal <b>reflux</b> disease) or larynx <b>reflux</b> disease {{can also be}} a major factor. Stomach acids that flow up through the esophagus can damage its lining and raise susceptibility to throat cancer.|$|E
25|$|Industrial towers use <b>reflux</b> {{to achieve}} a more {{complete}} separation of products. <b>Reflux</b> refers to {{the portion of the}} condensed overhead liquid product from a distillation or fractionation tower that is returned to {{the upper part of the}} tower as shown in the schematic diagram of a typical, large-scale industrial distillation tower. Inside the tower, the downflowing <b>reflux</b> liquid provides cooling and condensation of the upflowing vapors thereby increasing the efficiency of the distillation tower. The more <b>reflux</b> that is provided for a given number of theoretical plates, the better the tower's separation of lower boiling materials from higher boiling materials. Alternatively, the more <b>reflux</b> that is provided for a given desired separation, the fewer the number of theoretical plates required. Chemical engineers must choose what combination of <b>reflux</b> rate and number of plates is both economically and physically feasible for the products purified in the distillation column.|$|E
