50|$|The {{building}} scooped Sustainable Project of the Year in the Building Awards 2013, {{fighting off}} stiff competition from seven other contenders. The critics described the Hive as “truly impressive”, praising its design, {{which is based}} on allowing as much sunlight into the building as possible. They were also impressed by the gold-clad cones which contain glazed <b>rooflights</b> and vertical glazing, as well as the low energy lighting. The use of the river Severn for water chillers, and a rainwater tank, that collects water dripping off the roof to flush the toilets were also factors in the award.|$|E

50|$|The sugar {{industry}} sustained {{the local economy}} during the 1930s depression, and the district expanded. Although plans for extensions to the Council Chambers, including a second storey and rear extension, were rejected as being too costly at £4000, ground floor extensions, at half the original projected cost, were completed in 1939. This extension appears included the present second entrance corridor and the wing of 4 offices to the southeast, and the consequent extension of the verandah and roof. The construction of the <b>rooflight,</b> the second arched portico reflecting the first, and the new curved entrance portico {{may also have been}} constructed at this time. The southwest verandahs were enclosed in the early 1970s to allow for more office space while those on the northeast side were enclosed at an earlier date.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} end of the building has a loading bay separating the men's toilet block and store from the main station building, all of which front the railway platform.

The building is generally of brick, with rendered ornamentation to the street facades, a plate glass shopfront at ground level, a cantilevered awning over and a corrugated iron roof with <b>rooflights.</b> It now houses a furniture and carpet store known as Smith and Miller, and several other retail tenancies.|$|E
50|$|The {{concrete}} shell roof spans 225 xx 125 ft, with {{a double}} curvature sheet {{in the form of}} an elliptical paraboloid, mostly only 3 in thick but up to 6 in at the edges. It is claimed to be the largest concrete shell structure ever built, and the largest clear spanning dome roof in Europe. The shallow structure only rises 30 ft in the centre, and is supported by pre-stressed concrete edge beams with clerestory glazing below, so it appear to balance on its corners. It is pierced by circular <b>rooflights.</b> The external roof surface and gables on each side are clad in copper.|$|E
50|$|The {{pumping station}} house is {{predominantly}} constructed in red brick with stone dressings, the roofs are generally pitched and tiled in clay, and the eaves decorated with modillion eaves and cornices.

It is flanked by aisled constructions with apsidal ends and with semi-conical roofs. The southwestern end is also prominent, again with large gabled roof, with a semi-circular extension with semi-conical roof on the western end, and a circular corner turret with conical roof on the east. The northern {{part of the building}} comprises a large uninterrupted wing, with a longitudinal pitched roof with glazed <b>rooflight</b> ventilators, and seven smaller gabled roofs at right-angles to the main roof. There are many large gothic windows within the various facades.|$|R
500|$|The initial {{conservation}} work focused around weatherproofing the house. The {{repair of}} the roof, which is 20 {{times the size}} of the average British family’s home, was made possible by the erection of an extensive free-standing scaffold roof structure. At the height of the restoration works, [...] of scaffolding tubes covered the building's entire exterior. This allowed over 18 months repairs and restoration to take place, including the final restoration of the original bold red and black tiled geometric diaper pattern. The entire property was rewired with special cabling, copper sheathed (fire and rodent proofed). Much of the original lead piping was replaced and a fireproofing scheme, mainly through the design of a suitable compartmentation system was designed and implemented. Interior scaffolding was installed in the [...] high hallway to repair the lantern <b>rooflight,</b> and to provide access to other high points of the interior. These initial works cost more than £10 million, much of which was raised through donations via the [...] "Save Tyntesfield" [...] campaign and the sale of lottery tickets to visitors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house has}} a symmetrically {{organised}} plan, comprising two finely decorated major central rooms - a Drawing Room {{to the south and}} Billiard Room to the north, flanked by wings of bedrooms, with the kitchen in the north west corner. The entrance lobby projects into the Drawing Room, and has a front door with coloured glass surrounds, and small side doors with coloured glass panels. The Drawing Room is a generously proportioned and finely finished space, with a timber boarded ceiling with raked edges and a central coloured glass <b>rooflight,</b> and a frieze running between a timber picture rail and cornice. The door between the Drawing Room and Billiard Room has fine coloured glass panels in timber surrounds. The Billiard Room is encircled with [...] "grained" [...] painted timber panels which run under a silky oak shelf at lintel height, with vertically jointed timber above, finishing in a stencilled frieze running between a timber picture rail and cornice. The north-eastern corner of the room has a diagonally placed fireplace with glazed ceramic tiles, and silky oak mantelpiece and cabinet above. The western end has a large mirror in richly carved surrounds, while the northern wall forms a bay with a central window, and has double doors either side of the bay. Bedrooms all are lined with vertically-jointed timber walls and ceilings, and have fretwork fanlights above the doors.|$|R

50|$|Designed by Manchester City Architects Department under G. Noel Hill, and {{completed}} in 1942, the garage was a pioneering example of its type of construction. It {{is located in}} Harling Road, off Sharston Road in the Sharston district of Wythenshawe. It was the second-largest reinforced concrete shell roof structure to be constructed in England. The building’s structure was particularly innovative for its time. Its concrete arches have a span of 165 ft (50.3m) from side to side, are 42 ft (12.8m) high and spaced 42 ft (12.8m) apart. The tensile concrete shell roof between these concrete arches is just 2.5 inches (63.5mm) thick and is daringly punctured by large <b>rooflights.</b> Wythenshawe Garage {{proved to be the}} model for much larger buildings using the concrete shell roof structure technique, which was an economic method of achieving large uninterrupted roof spans.|$|E
5000|$|In 1970 the Supreme Court {{moved to}} new {{premises}} and the Vehicle Licensing Division of Department of Transport occupied the front section of the building. The building became vacant after the Department of Transport {{moved to new}} premises in the mid 1980s. In 1972 the caretaker's residence was sold for removal. In 1994 the roof was reinstated using Federal [...] "One Nation" [...] funding. The building was also painted around this time. However, on 14 April 1998, before the conservations works could be finished the former Townsville Supreme Court building was destroyed by fire. What little of the timber building that remained after the fire was later removed from the site due to safety concerns. The remains {{of the late nineteenth}} century drystone wall is the only remaining physical evidence on the site. At the time the building was destroyed it was described as:The axis of the building is north-south, with the main entry at the northern end facing Cleveland Terrace. The north facade has a two- storeyed verandah with crossed timber balustrades and curved boarded valances to both levels, and a central projecting portico with paired timber posts topped with a pediment and a flagpole as finial. The double entry doors have an arched fanlight, and large single pane double-hung windows with arched heads to either side. Behind are two levels of offices and chambers each side of a central corridor.This northern section of the building has hipped roofs in a U-shaped configuration. There is a glazed lantern with curved domed roof on one of the ridges. The double-hung windows, smaller than those of the front, have two panes per sash and are shaded by continuous curved corrugated iron hoods. The walls are clad in weatherboards.The interior of this section has walls lined with wide horizontal beaded boards, and high ceilings of double beaded boards. The entry has the remnant of a gold painted sign beside the arched opening. The room beside the entry retains its moulded timber counter. In the cupboard under the stair are small remnants of theatrical posters dating from 1879-1880. Doors here are typically low-waisted four panel, some with fanlights. The floors are timber boards.In the upper level, the lantern provides a boarded <b>rooflight</b> to the central corridor. At the end of the corridor, an arched opening and timber balustrade form a balcony which overlooks the courtroom. To the very upper portion of the walls is a panel of perforated zinc ventilation grilles. The former Judges chambers retain their cedar bookshelves. From this level, the northern verandah has views over Cleveland Bay.Detached to the west of this section is the strongroom of painted brick. It has a curved corrugated iron roof, iron door and small barred window.The central part of the building is the single-storeyed Courtroom. The gabled roof has dormer windows and ventilators along its ridge. On the east side is the Courtroom's gabled entry porch, which has a scalloped bargeboard, boarded valance and timber posts with capitals. A verandah with similar valance runs the length of the western side. From this verandah, an external timber stair leads to the Judges' chambers.The Courtroom has exposed scissor trusses with stop-chamfered members, and raked ceilings lined in diagonal boarding above. There is a dormer window to each side of the ridge. The large double-hung windows, two to each side, have single pane sashes and arched heads, and are similar to those beside the main entry. Again, the walls are lined in horizontal beaded boards and the floors timber.To {{the southern end of the}} Courtroom is an elevated timber stage, with stairs to either side. Court furniture retained in place includes the cedar judges' bench with screen behind, the stand for the witness box, the defendant's dock, the jury stand, and a timber rail and tiered benches for the public at the rear.To the rear of the Courtroom are three small offices at the level of the stage. From here, a link of latticed walls and curved corrugated iron roof connects to the Jury Room to the east. The Jury Room is a single timber room, with toilets added to the north. Its subfloor construction includes brickwork of an earlier building in this position. It has a pyramid roof and ventilator at its apex, and timber hoods to its windows.Behind this block is a small brick shower room, with lean-to roof and boarded shutter. Behind the shower and of similar height, is a stone pitched retaining wall marking the rear of the site.Along the western side of the main building runs a graded brick retaining wall, forming the terrace of the remainder of the site. Further to the west, is a timber cell block and a timber toilet block.|$|R
50|$|St Paul's Bus Station is {{dominated}} by an elliptical roof standing on twelve steel columns. The concrete roof covers an area of 3171 m2, beneath which are three bus islands, consisting {{of a total of}} eleven bus stands. A smaller aerofoil covers a further three stands. 2.4 m tall glass screens shelter pedestrians from bus fumes and provide information on bus routes. At each of the bus stands is hardwood bench set within a low concrete wall. The benches were designed to be vandal-proof. At its longest point, the canopy is 80 m in length and 45 m wide at its widest point. The roof is covered in ten circular holes with hoods to deflect the wind. There are seventeen similar <b>rooflights</b> in the canopy. The concourse area is two storeys tall and consists of large concrete walls, supporting the columns for the canopy roof. The bus station covers a total area of 9470 m2.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} features of the Argyll Mausoleum is thelarge cast iron dome over the building. When it was constructed in the 1790s, the mausoleum had a slated pyramid roof with no windows. This had the effect that no daylight could enter the building, except when the doors were open. When the Marquess of Lorne supervised his mother's funeral in 1878, he described {{the interior of the}} mausoleum as 'ghastly'. When he supervised the restoration of the mausoleum in the 1890s, he had the pyramid roof replaced in 1891-93 by a domed roof with <b>rooflights</b> and an enormous cast iron dome at the apex. It is believed that the massive cast iron dome was forged at a foundry in the Glasgow shipyards and transported to the site. The craftsmen's marks can still be seen {{on the inside of the}} roof. The decision to put such a heavy object on the extant mausoleum walls seems to have been controversial at the time, although the weight proved to have little detrimental effect.|$|E
