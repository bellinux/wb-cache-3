If {{the ground in}} which the pipe is laid has high points - such as Hi1, 2 etc. and low points between them such as Lo1, 2 etc., then if the pipe is filled from the top, and was empty, the pipe fills OK as far as Hi1. If the water flow velocity is below the <b>rising</b> <b>velocity</b> of air bubbles ref, then water trickles down to the low point Lo2 and traps the remaining air between Hi1 and Lo2. As more water flows down, the upward leg Lo2 to Hi2 fills up. This exerts a pressure on the trapped air of either H2 m of water (WG = water gauge) or H1, whichever is less. If H2 is greater than H1, {{then you have a}} full air lock, and the water level in the up leg Lo2 to Hi2 stops at H1 and no further water can flow. If H1 is greater than H2, then some water can flow, but the full pipe hydraulic head H3 will not be reached and so flow is much less than expected. If there are further undulations, then the back pressure effects add together. Obviously long pipelines over fairly level, but undulating land, are bound to have many such high and low points. To avoid air or gas lock, automatic vents are fitted which let air or gas out when above a certain pressure. They may also be designed to let air in under vacuum. There are many other design considerations for design of water pipeline systems e.g.|$|E

The basis of this technique was that the horizontal distance that the float travels {{on its way to}} the surface is the image of the integrated velocity profile over depth. Viol and Semenov (1964) improved this method by using air bubbles as floats, but still distances were measured manually until Sargent (1981) introduced a technique that could derive the distances from two photographs simultaneously taken from each side of the river bank.

To elucidate the seepage behavior in the marine sediment, CO 2 bubble dynamics in partially saturated porous media was studied. Force balance on a CO 2 bubble in porous media was calculated by considering buoyancy force, surface tension effect and drag force. To consider the effect of porosity, permeability and wetting fluid saturation on ascent of CO 2 in porous media, a new surface tension force model was studied.

Particle image velocimetry is widely used technique for investigating the fluid flow in a whole plane, which is non-intrusive where flow-marker or tracer particles are added into the flow and their behaviour is observed. Image processing technique is an effective and appropriate method {{for the assessment of}} BSD, bubble <b>rise</b> <b>velocity,</b> residence time distribution of bubbles, bubble trajectory and indirect approximation of gas hold-up up. A 700 x 200 x 57 mm single/multiple needle rectangular bubble column operating a wide range of superficial velocities is used for the investigation...|$|R
