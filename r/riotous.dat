5|$|Despite this <b>riotous</b> lifestyle, Harvey married Lady Louisa Nugent in 1784. Louisa was a {{daughter}} of Robert Nugent, 1st Earl Nugent and co-heir to his substantial wealth. The couple had nine children, eight of whom survived infancy and six of whom, all daughters, outlived their father. Harvey's eldest son was killed in action serving in the British Army under the Marquess of Wellington at the Siege of Burgos in 1812. Harvey remained in semi-retirement until 1790, dividing his time between London and Rolls Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{fan base}} went wild, and a <b>riotous</b> celebration {{gathered}} at Ebisu Bridge in Dōtonbori, Osaka. There, {{an assemblage of}} supporters yelled the players' names, and with every name, a fan resembling {{a member of the}} victorious team leaped from the bridge into the waiting canal. However, lacking a Caucasian person to imitate MVP Randy Bass, the rabid crowd seized a plastic statue of Colonel Sanders (like Bass, the Colonel had a beard and was not Japanese) from a nearby KFC and tossed it off the bridge as an effigy.|$|E
5|$|Villani {{states that}} the commune of Florence spent more than 60,000 gold florins to {{mitigate}} this effects of this disaster. In order to save their own funds and calm the rage of the <b>riotous</b> poor, all the baker's ovens in the city were requisitioned by the commune and {{a loaf of bread}} weighing 170 g (6oz) was then sold at a meager four pennies. This price was fixed in consideration that poor workers who made only eight to twelve pennies a day could now buy enough bread to survive.|$|E
5|$|You {{have more}} to do than simply abstain from <b>riotous</b> proceedings. You must not stand behind riots and let violators of the law promote the {{destruction}} of property. You are responsible for the violence that has been done, whether you were actually engaged in it or not. You on your part must drive away from you the evil-disposed people who have done so much harm, and discountenance in the plainest way everything tending to violence.|$|E
5|$|In 1841, {{following}} {{suggestions from}} the local paving board, Barry agreed that two fountains should be installed to counteract the effects of reflected heat and glare from the asphalt surface. The First Commissioner of Woods and Forests welcomed the plan because the fountains reduced the open space available for public gatherings and reduced the risk of <b>riotous</b> assembly. The fountains were fed from two wells, one {{in front of the}} National Gallery and one behind it connected by a tunnel. Water was pumped to the fountains by a steam engine housed in a building behind the gallery.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Ngô family {{claimed that}} the army had carried out the raids, {{something}} their U.S. allies initially believed. However, this was later debunked, and the incident prompted the United States to turn against the regime and begin exploring alternative leadership options, eventually leading to Diệm's overthrow in a coup. In South Vietnam itself, the raids stoked widespread anger. Several high-ranking public servants resigned, and university {{and high school students}} boycotted classes and staged <b>riotous</b> demonstrations, resulting in further mass incarcerations. As most of the students were from middle-class public service and military families, the arrests caused further upset among the Ngô family's power base.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{children}} were born to William and Matilda. All were devout Anglicans, with William and his wife being supporters of the Oxford Movement. He was a major benefactor of Keble College, Oxford, and dedicated the later {{part of his life}} to philanthropic works. Also being teetotal, he added to the estate's holding by buying the local Failand Inn, which enabled him to control any <b>riotous</b> behaviour (it was sold to Courage Brewery in 1962 by the second Lord Wraxall). William Gibbs died in the house on 3 April 1875. After a service at the estate chapel on 9 April, 30 estate workers carried his coffin to All Saints Church, Wraxall. He is buried within the family plot in the church grounds.|$|E
5|$|The Gray's Inn masque in 1588 {{with its}} centrepiece, The Misfortunes of Arthur by Thomas Hughes, is {{considered}} by A.W. Ward be the most impressive masque thrown {{at any of the}} Inns. William Shakespeare performed at the Inn at least once, as his patron, Lord Southampton, was a member. For the Christmas of 1594, his play The Comedy of Errors was performed by the Lord Chamberlain's Men before a <b>riotous</b> assembly of notables in such disorder that the affair became known as the Night of Errors and a mock trial was held to arraign the culprit.|$|E
5|$|Durga Puja is the biggest, {{most popular}} and widely celebrated festival in West Bengal. The five-day-long {{colourful}} Hindu festival witnesses intense celebration across the state. Pandals are erected in various cities, towns and villages throughout West Bengal. The whole city of Kolkata undergoes a transformation during Durga Puja, as it is decked up in lighting decorations and thousands of colourful pandals are set up where effigies of goddess Durga and her four children are worshipped and displayed. The idols of the goddess as brought in from Kumortuli, where idol-makers work round the year fashioning the clay-models of the goddess. Since independence in 1947, Durga Puja has slowly changed into more of a glamorous carnival than a religious festival, where people across diverse religious and ethnic spectrum partake in the festivity. On Vijayadashami, {{the last day of}} the festival, the effigies are paraded through the streets with <b>riotous</b> pageantry before being dumped into the rivers.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Savage began {{a ten-year}} stay in San Francisco. He worked {{with his father}} and brother on an iron foundry enterprise, and served two years as colonel of the 2nd Regiment California National Guard. Savage took a {{prominent}} role in the civic and social life of the city, and was often called upon to make extemporaneous speeches to large crowds, a skill on which politician and economist Henry George complimented him. In January 1878, Savage served as chief military executive officer of the Committee of Safety, a group set up to oppose Denis Kearney and his <b>riotous</b> mob of angry supporters who {{wanted to get rid of}} Chinese immigrants. Savage's calm and logical presence was seen by San Franciscans as a rallying point for law and order during the riots. Savage renewed the friendship of his childhood schoolmate, now Bohemian Club poet Charles Warren Stoddard. He made the acquaintance of writer Archibald Clavering Gunter, who would later publish some of Savage's stories.|$|E
5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of <b>riotous</b> insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 28 Indigenous Australians {{were arrested and}} charged with {{offences}} ranging from arson to <b>riotous</b> behaviour in the weeks following the riot.|$|E
25|$|After the <b>riotous</b> {{games of}} the late 1970s, several of the {{founding}} members left the league. The Ateneo de Manila University left the league in 1978 due to violence, which also marred a championship series with San Beda, while La Salle left after a <b>riotous</b> game with Letran in 1980. Ateneo de Manila was accepted in the UAAP in 1978, while La Salle {{had to wait for}} six years to become a UAAP member. San Beda left the league in 1983, reasoning that the college focused on school-based sports activities like intramurals.|$|E
25|$|Kahekili, a local warrior, {{commanded}} a small battery {{on the walls}} of a fort at Lahaina. He requested permission to return fire, which Hoapili refused. Hoapili then in 1831 built a more substantial fort, Old Lahaina Fort, to protect the town from <b>riotous</b> sailors.|$|E
25|$|A film of {{the protest}} was a key piece of evidence, {{countering}} the State's claim that the singing from the jail turned the peaceful assembly into a <b>riotous</b> one; the judges watched it with rapt attention. The film showed the protest was peaceful until the police joined in.|$|E
25|$|In April 1831, the {{officers}} were acquitted of all charges, and on 9 May 1831, a banquet was held in their honor, with many illustrious people present, such as Alexandre Dumas. The proceedings grew <b>riotous,</b> and Galois proposed a toast to King Louis Philippe with a dagger above his cup, which was interpreted as a threat against the king's life. He was arrested the following day but was acquitted on 15 June 1831.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Nate Parker {{produced}} {{and directed the}} film The Birth of a Nation, based on the 1831 slave rebellion led by Nat Turner. Parker states:I've reclaimed this title and re-purposed it {{as a tool to}} challenge racism and white supremacy in America, to inspire a <b>riotous</b> disposition toward any and all injustice in this country (and abroad) and to promote the kind of honest confrontation that will galvanize our society toward healing and sustained systemic change.|$|E
25|$|In 1854 {{events at}} the annual balls in {{the grounds of the}} Barn {{included}} the aeronaut Charles Green's balloon ascent. By 1865 there was a huge dancing platform, a rebuilt theatre, high-wire acts, pantomime, music hall and the original Siamese twins. The Barn became the victim of its own success. After a riot led by students from Bart’s Hospital in 1869, locals complained about the Barn’s increasingly <b>riotous</b> and bawdy clientele. This led to a court case and in 1871 authorities revoked the Barn’s dancing licence.|$|E
25|$|Reinforcements arrived {{early on}} 12 December, but <b>riotous</b> {{incidents}} continued on that day. The troops and police only managed {{to regain control}} of the situation by noon on 13 December. In total, 18 people were killed, among whom were seven Europeans or Eurasians, two police officers, and nine rioters shot by the police or military, 173 were injured, many of them seriously, 119 vehicles were damaged, and at least two buildings were set on fire. Subsequently, two weeks of 24-hour curfew were imposed, and {{it was a long time}} before complete law and order was re-established.|$|E
25|$|Al-Husseini, {{like many}} of his class and period, then turned from Damascus-oriented Pan-Arabism to a {{specifically}} Palestinian ideology, centered on Jerusalem, which sought to block Jewish immigration to Mandatory Palestine. The frustration of pan-Arab aspirations lent an Islamic colour to the struggle for independence, and increasing resort to the idea of restoring the land to Dar al-Islam. From his election as Mufti until 1923, al-Husseini exercised total control over the secret society, Al-Fida’iyya (The Self-Sacrificers), which, together with al-Ikha’ wal-‘Afaf (Brotherhood and Purity), {{played an important role in}} clandestine anti-British and anti-Zionist activities, and, via members in the gendarmerie, had engaged in <b>riotous</b> activities as early as April 1920.|$|E
25|$|During the English Restoration period (1660–88), {{the term}} 'rake' was used glamorously: the Restoration rake is a carefree, witty, sexually irresistible aristocrat typified by CharlesII's courtiers, the Earl of Rochester and the Earl of Dorset, who {{combined}} <b>riotous</b> living with intellectual pursuits and patronage of the arts. The Restoration rake is {{celebrated in the}} Restoration comedy of the 1660s and the 1670s. After the reign of CharlesII, and especially after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the rake was perceived negatively and became the butt of moralistic tales in which his typical fate was debtor's prison, permanent venereal disease, and, {{in the case of}} William Hogarth's A Rake's Progress, syphilis-induced insanity and internment in Bedlam.|$|E
25|$|Umpires, players, team officials, {{trainers}} and police {{did their best}} to clear a pathway for Collins to take his kick, and after several minutes, they did succeed temporarily; however, Pilgrim did not allow Collins to take his kick at this time because he was not on the correct line with the goal. The crowd again converged on Collins before he could correct his line, and the opportunity was lost. By this stage, the pitch invasion was <b>riotous,</b> with many punches thrown, and umpires, players, team officials, and police were now tasked with restoring order, particularly after Collins' teammate Barry Styles was knocked to the ground and trampled; he was left unconscious with broken fingers and had to be carried from the field on a stretcher.|$|E
25|$|Popular {{religion}} {{revolves around}} the saints, who are perceived as intercessors (but not mediators) between human beings and God. Most localities, from the capital of Managua to small rural communities, honour patron saints, selected from the Roman Catholic calendar, with annual fiestas. In many communities, a rich lore has grown up around the celebrations of patron saints, such as Managua's Saint Dominic (Santo Domingo), honoured in August with two colourful, often <b>riotous,</b> day-long processions through the city. The high point of Nicaragua's religious calendar for the masses is neither Christmas nor Easter, but La Purísima, a week of festivities in early December dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, during which elaborate altars to the Virgin Mary are constructed in homes and workplaces.|$|E
25|$|A full {{replay of}} the state final at a neutral venue (namely York Park in Launceston) was a {{potential}} solution, and each club was approached for its opinion. Wynyard was in favour of a replay match; on 2 October, they were quoted as being satisfied with a game at a neutral venue, but with a different umpire, suggesting a high calibre umpire be brought from Victoria to officiate; the following day, Wynyard instead {{said it would be}} happy for Pilgrim to umpire any replay, but that the game should again be played in Burnie. North Hobart, on the other hand, was opposed to playing a replay, stating that the club had fulfilled its obligations to the league for the season, and that to replay the game would vindicate the <b>riotous</b> behaviour of the north-western crowd.|$|E
25|$|But by 1820 {{faith in}} the {{efficacy}} of legal reform had declined as statutory changes had no discernible effect {{on the level of}} crime and the prisons, where prisoners shared large rooms and booty including alcohol, had become <b>riotous</b> and prone to escapes. In response, New York developed the Auburn system in which prisoners were confined in separate cells and prohibited from talking when eating and working together, implementing it at Auburn State Prison and Sing Sing at Ossining. The aim of this was rehabilitative: the reformers talked about the penitentiary serving {{as a model for the}} family and the school and almost all the states adopted the plan (though Pennsylvania went even further in separating prisoners). The system's fame spread and visitors to the U.S. to see the prisons included de Tocqueville who wrote Democracy in America as a result of his visit.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Henry's son Hal is joking, drinking, and thieving with Falstaff and his associates. He likes Falstaff {{but makes}} no pretense at being like him. He enjoys {{insulting}} his dissolute friend and makes sport of him by joining in Poins’ plot to disguise themselves and rob and terrify Falstaff and three friends of loot they have stolen in a highway robbery, purely {{for the fun of}} watching Falstaff lie about it later, after which Hal returns the stolen money. Rather early in the play, in fact, Hal informs us that his <b>riotous</b> time will soon come to a close, and he will re-assume his rightful high place in affairs by showing himself worthy to his father and others through some (unspecified) noble exploits. Hal believes that this sudden change of manner will amount to a greater reward and acknowledgment of prince-ship, and in turn earn him respect from the members of the court.|$|E
25|$|Dubois was {{provisionally}} appointed {{general of}} division on 10 March 1794. This promotion was confirmed on 30 March. He arrived at Guise to take {{command of the}} cavalry brigades from the divisions of Antoine Balland and Jacques Gilles Henri Goguet. Dubois attempted to impose discipline on the unruly and <b>riotous</b> regiments. Unfortunately the organizations were changing constantly, preventing him from accomplishing much. After Goguet was assassinated by his own troops on 21 April, Dubois took over the division. On 4 May, Dubois' division counted 11,353 soldiers and was posted at Bohéries Abbey near Guise. Balland's 12,701-man division and Dubois' division made up {{the center of the}} Army of the North under Jacques Ferrand. After 10 May, the brigade of Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul was sent to {{the right wing of the}} Army of the North. On 26 May, Dubois left with a second cavalry brigade to join the right wing at Maubeuge. He took command of a cavalry division assembled at Ham-sur-Heure on 10 June 1794. The 2,315 troopers were divided into brigades under Hautpoul and Guillaume Soland, each with a horse artillery battery attached. Hautpoul led the 12th Dragoons (406), 2nd Hussars (265) and 6th Chasseurs-à-Cheval (624) while Soland led the 6th Cavalry (550) and 8th Cavalry (470).|$|E
25|$|On 29 October 1672 he {{took part}} in the first {{ordination}} by presbyterians of the north since the Restoration, held in Deansgate, Manchester, at the house of Robert Eaton, an ejected divine, afterwards minister of Stand, Lancashire. When the licenses were recalled (February 1675) Heywood resumed his itinerant labours. He is said in a single year to have travelled 1,400 miles, preached 105 times, besides Sunday duty, and kept fifty fast days and nine of thanksgiving. He assisted in the first presbyterian ordination in Yorkshire, at Richard Mitchel's house in Craven, on 8 July 1678. On 16 January 1685 he was convicted at the Wakefield sessions for 'a <b>riotous</b> assembly' in his house. Refusing to pay a fine of £50, and to give sureties for good behaviour, he was imprisoned in York Castle from 26 January to 19 December. He approved of James's declaration (1687) for liberty of conscience, and at once set about building a meeting house at Northowram (opened 8 July 1688), to which he subsequently added a school. The first master was David Hartley (appointed 5 October 1693), father of David Hartley the philosopher. His meeting house was licensed under the Toleration Act on 18 July 1689.|$|E

500|$|A famine {{spread across}} Tuscany in 1328. From 1329 to 1330 Villani was a commune-appointed {{magistrate}} of provisioning protecting Florence from the famine's worst effects. In order to mitigate rising levels of starvation and assuage peasant discontent, grain was speedily imported from Sicily through Talamone, [...] {{were taken from}} the city purse by the Florentine commune to aid the relief effort, and all the city's bakers had their ovens requisitioned by the government so that loaves of bread could be sold at affordable prices to the <b>riotous</b> and starving poor.|$|E

500|$|Book 1 of Annals {{extensively}} {{focuses on}} the mutinies of the legions in Pannonia and Germany (AD 14). The <b>riotous</b> army figures into the unpredictable wrath of the Roman people giving Tiberius the chance to reflect on {{what it means to}} lead. It serves to contrast the [...] "old-fashioned" [...] Republican values assigned to Germanicus, and the imperial values possessed by Tiberius. The mood of the masses is a recurring theme, with their reactions to the fortunes of Germanicus being a prominent feature of the relationship between him and Tiberius well into the Annals (as far as Annals 3.19).|$|E

After the fort was demolished in 1854, a courthouse was built on the site. A portion of the old Lahaina Fort was reconstructed in 1964.
