This was the country's first mail order library operation {{and has become}} one of the few remaining. Descriptive catalogs are designed by library staff for home use and are distributed three times per year on all rural postal routes. Books, audio recordings, and video recordings are mailed directly to the user's home and may be returned using the merchandise <b>return</b> <b>label</b> included in each shipment.|$|E
50|$|In one typical use of freepost, a {{business}} sends bulk mail to potential customers, the bulk mail including envelopes or postcards that potential customers {{can return to}} the business by freepost. In another typical use, magazines include subscription cards that potential subscribers can return by freepost. In yet another typical use, a seller can provide a merchandise <b>return</b> <b>label</b> bearing the appropriate freepost indicia (as described below) to a customer so that the customer can return the item to the seller by freepost upon issuance of a Return Merchandise Authorization.|$|E
30|$|The {{composition}} of the delivery package design includes the outside appearance (e.g., color, shape, size) and its contents (e.g., extra gifts, coupons, <b>return</b> <b>labels,</b> fillers, and receipts). We focus on color, extra gifts, coupons, and <b>return</b> <b>labels</b> as the four most critical aspects in our study, {{because they do not}} heavily rely on the characteristics of ordered products (i.e., we do not consider shape, size, and fillers) and can potentially influence consumer behavior (see Sect.  2). Moreover, e-retailers can easily manipulate all these factors.|$|R

50|$|Modules are {{designed}} to be stand-alone lessons that fit into and compliment a life science curriculum. The ASSET program ships all the equipment that is needed to complete the modules to the teacher in a reusable plastic container, at ASSET's expense. The teacher who requested the materials can use them for up to two weeks. At the end of the two weeks, the teacher uses a pre-paid <b>return</b> <b>label</b> to send the materials back in the same container. Some materials, such as live cells, may be sent separately to provide for a chance for the culture to be established in the teacher's classroom.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2010, an Apple I {{sold for}} £133,250 ($210,000) at Christie's auction house in London. The high price was {{likely due to}} the rare {{documents}} and packaging offered in the sale {{in addition to the}} computer, including the original packaging (with the <b>return</b> <b>label</b> showing Steve Jobs' parents' address, the original Apple Computer Inc 'headquarters' being their garage), a personally typed and signed letter from Jobs (answering technical questions about the computer), and the original invoice showing 'Steven' as the salesman. The computer was brought to Polytechnic University of Turin where it was fixed and used to run the BASIC programming language.|$|E
50|$|One {{night he}} {{receives}} a small envelope {{in the mail}} with no <b>return</b> <b>label,</b> inside of which is an Ace of Diamonds with three addresses and times of day written on them. After his friends deny any involvement, Ed travels to the first address on the card at midnight and witnesses a man raping his wife while their daughter cries on the porch. The other addresses correspond to a senile widow named Milla who lives alone and refers to him as Jimmy, {{as well as a}} young girl named Sophie who runs barefoot every morning but still cannot win at her track meets. Ed researches Milla's history and discovers that she is waiting for her husband who died sixty years ago during World War II, so he pretends to be Jimmy and comes to reads to her weekly. He raises Sophie's spirits by giving her an empty shoe box to get her to try running barefoot at her next competition, and even though she loses again, she still finds pride in her achievement. Finally, he receives a gun in the mail and kidnaps the rapist before threatening to kill him for his crimes.|$|E

30|$|In Study 1, we {{designed}} an experiment with eight different treatments and invited 375 (43 for a pretest and 332 {{for the main}} experiment) subjects to participate. We first used analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to examine the influence of colorful packages, extra gifts, and preprinted <b>return</b> <b>labels</b> on consumers’ <b>return</b> intentions. We then estimated a PLS model to better understand how these effects operate through consumers’ cognitive–affective reaction processes.|$|R

5000|$|Years {{after leaving}} Microsoft, Moore {{recalled}} preparing to tell then CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, of his planned {{response to the}} incident, [...] "we've got to tell Steve, here's {{what we have to}} do: we need to FedEx an empty box to a customer who had a problem - they would call us up - with a FedEx <b>return</b> <b>label</b> to send your box, and then we would FedEx it back to them and fix it. ... I always remember $240m of that was FedEx. ... It was sickening. I was doing a lot of interviews. ... We couldn't figure it out. ... There was a theory. We had changed our solder, which is the way you put the GPU and the fans, to lead-free. ... We think it was somehow the heat coming off the GPU was drying out some of the solder, and it wasn't the normal stuff we'd used, because we had to meet European Standards and take the lead out. ... He said, 'what's it going to cost?' I remember taking a deep breath, looking at Robbie, and saying, 'we think it's $1.15bn, Steve.' He said, 'do it.' There was no hesitation. ... If we hadn't made that decision there and then, and tried to fudge over this problem, then the Xbox brand and Xbox One wouldn't exist today." ...|$|E
30|$|Our results further {{showed that}} a {{preprinted}} <b>return</b> <b>label</b> had no significant effect on consumer satisfaction or return intentions (p > . 1, see Table  4). However, this result might have occurred because European consumers know that their return rights are highly protected by the Consumer Protection Law, and thus the 14 -day return policy is already deeply rooted in their decision processes. The other possible {{reason is that the}} preprinted <b>return</b> <b>label</b> does not significantly reduce return costs. We also tested the interactions among color, gift, and <b>return</b> <b>label,</b> but none of them were significant.|$|E
30|$|We {{employed}} a 2 (colorful vs. not colorful) ×  2 (gift vs. no gift) ×  2 (preprinted <b>return</b> <b>label</b> vs. no preprinted <b>return</b> <b>label)</b> between-subjects design on the online survey platform Dynamic Intelligent Survey Engine. 2 In step 1, we randomly assigned participants {{to one of}} the eight experimental conditions and asked for demographic information (i.e., age, gender, and career). In step 2, we simulated an online purchase process. Participants were asked to imagine that they had decided to buy a jersey of the German national football team for the upcoming World Cup and then to specify their size and gender in order to obtain the appropriate jersey.|$|E
30|$|The α-expansion {{algorithm}} is summarized as follows. Given an arbitrary initial labeling f and a label α, a weighted edge is formed between neighboring nodes, {{and the goal}} is to find a new labeling f' which minimizes the energy over all the nodes’ labels through one α-expansion move. During the α-expansion move, it just changes the nodes whose label is not α, and the other nodes whose label is α maintain the same value. If the energy of new labeling f' is less than the original, it continues to perform another one α-expansion move; otherwise, <b>returns</b> the current <b>labeling</b> f' with the minimal energy. Therefore, the <b>returned</b> <b>labeling</b> f' is the final solution of the energy function, which assigns a best label to each triangular mesh.|$|R

30|$|We {{placed a}} {{preprinted}} and prepaid DHL label with a return shipping address into the package. To return the package, participants needed only to glue this <b>return</b> <b>label</b> {{to the original}} delivery package {{and bring it to}} a post station. In the control group, participants needed to log into their accounts, complete several forms, and then print the return document themselves. We reasoned that a preprinted, prepaid DHL label could significantly reduce return costs and thus, according to utility theory, increase consumers’ return intentions.|$|E
30|$|In step 6, we {{surveyed}} participants’ current emotions {{and the perceived}} utility of the whole package, along with their satisfaction and return intentions. To keep the package in participants’ minds, we placed {{a picture of the}} package, showing all the items, {{at the top of the}} questionnaire (see Fig.  3). In step 7, in order to match their return intention to real return behavior, we communicated that every participant had a chance to win the real package shown in the video (with extra gift/colorful package/preprinted <b>return</b> <b>label</b> and a jersey with a stain) and that they could send the jersey back for a new, flawless one. We then asked whether they would really return their jersey in that case. As an additional motivation and to increase realism, we asked participants to voluntarily give their contact information and jersey size.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an approach based on supervised learning techniques for {{the diagnosis of}} dynamic systems. The methodology can start with real system data or with {{a model of the}} dynamic system. In the second case, a set of simulations of the system is required to obtain the necessary data. In both cases, obtained data will be labelled according to the running conditions of the system at the gathering data time. Label indicates the running state of system: correct working or abnormal functioning of any system component. After being labelled, data will be treated to add additional information about the running of system. The final goal is to obtain a set of decision rules by applying a classification tool to the set of labelled and treated data. This way, any observation on the system will be classified according to those decision rules, having a <b>return</b> <b>label</b> indicating the currently running state of system. Returned label will be the diagnostic. This entire learning task is carried out off-line, before the diagnosing...|$|E

30|$|Prior {{literature}} usually considers consumer return behavior {{a consequence}} of cognitive reactions. According to utility theory, consumers return products only if the net perceived utilities (i.e., the utilitarian utility and hedonic utility) are negative. The net perceived utilities are evaluated by a customer’s perceived utilities at the purchase stage, the perceived fit of the transaction (e.g., physical fit or sensory related to color), and the return costs (Anderson et al. 2009) {{at the moment of}} the receipt. In the situation of online shopping, the perceived utilities (including utilitarian and hedonic utilities) are generated by product information given on websites and stored in consumers’ memories. The perceived utilities can be increased by lower purchase prices (due to a higher customer surplus) (Anderson et al. 2009 a), a good reputation, and a lenient return policy [i.e., longer deadlines, less required return effort, and more coverage (Roggeveen et al. 2014)]. Return costs are the fees that consumers must bear if they decide to return the ordered products, such as restocking fees and frictional costs for bringing the parcel to a post office (Frischmann et al. 2012), which could be reduced by a lenient return policy (e.g., a preprinted <b>return</b> <b>label).</b>|$|E
30|$|Previous {{research}} {{has acknowledged that}} various factors (e.g., product quality, product demonstration, return policies), working through a cognitive reaction process, can significantly impact consumer return behavior during the two-stage decision process of online purchasing (Anderson et al. 2009; Frischmann et al. 2012; Petersen and Kumar 2009; Wood 2001). However, no study has yet examined how consumer return decisions are influenced by a delivery package’s appearance (e.g., the color) and contents (e.g., extra gifts, preprinted <b>return</b> <b>labels),</b> or the affective action process. To close these gaps and identify useful packaging strategies, we combined the synergistic properties of two controlled experiments and an observational field study, which together offer robust insights into how the delivery package affects return intentions.|$|R

The 2 D layer returns a matrix containing pixel's clusters based on the Watershed transform. Whereas the 3 D layer <b>return</b> <b>labels,</b> that are classified by the V-Disparity technique, to free spaces, obstacles and non-classified area. Thus, a feature's descriptor for each cluster is composed with features from both layers. The road pattern recognition was performed by an artificial neural network, trained to obtain a final result from this feature's descriptor. The proposed work reports real experiments carried out in a challenging urban environment to illustrate the validity and application of this approach...|$|R

30|$|High product return {{rates are}} an {{increasingly}} pressing challenge for many e-retailers around the world. To address this problem, this paper {{offers a new}} perspective {{by focusing on the}} critical moment of the package-opening process. Going beyond previous research, which has primarily focused on website information and the product itself, we examine the effects of the outside appearance (i.e., the color of the delivery package) and contents of the delivery package (i.e., extra gifts, coupons, and preprinted <b>return</b> <b>labels)</b> on consumer <b>return</b> behavior. Our findings across two experimental studies and an observational field study show that a well-considered package design, including colorful packaging and extra gifts, significantly lowers consumers’ return intentions and actual returns. We also explore the process of consumers’ cognitive–affective reactions after opening a delivery package. During this two-stage reaction process, pleasure plays {{a crucial role in the}} consumer’s return choice.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes {{extending}} semi-supervised {{learning by}} allowing an ongoing interaction between a user and the system. The extension {{is intended to}} not only to speed up search for relevant aircraft engine maintenance records but also to help in improving the user’s understanding of the problem domain. After the user has identified {{a small number of}} relevant records, the system produces a description which generalizes their common properties. If the user is satisfied with the description, the system retrieves more potentially relevant records. The user critiques the items <b>returned,</b> <b>labeling</b> them as relevant or not. The system updates the description using this new labeling information and retrieves more records. The process continues until the user is satisfied that most relevant records have been found. To validate the efficacy of the approach, a set of related maintenance records are collected using the system. These records are compared to those collected without system support. ...|$|R
