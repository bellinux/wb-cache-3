50|$|Benefits include {{preventing}} buses {{from being}} delayed {{by having to}} pull back into traffic, reducing risk of traffic collisions, reducing pedestrian exposure in crosswalks (if provided at the same location), reducing sidewalk congestion, providing space for bus patron amenities including bus shelters, and traffic calming. The protrusion also facilitates easier full length alignment of a bus entrance with a <b>raised</b> <b>kerb</b> stop, especially to allow level boarding {{in the case of}} low-floor buses.|$|E
50|$|The entire igloo {{stands on}} a {{concrete}} slab foundation about 18 metres by 34 metres in plan, with a <b>raised</b> <b>kerb</b> and two external drains running along the building's long sides, and twenty cast concrete feet which support the trusses. There are ten trusses spanning the interior space. Each is composed of two curved half-trusses which are pinned at the foundations and at the apex where they meet: a three-pin truss system. The trusses are made entirely of sawn pieces of native hardwood nailed together.|$|E
50|$|A {{separate}} {{building has}} been {{attached to the}} rear of the auditorium. This weatherboard building with a corrugated galvanised iron roof, is a cafeteria.The Merriland Hall is approximately 60 m long and has an overall width of 30m. The igloo stands on a concrete slab foundation with a <b>raised</b> <b>kerb</b> and two external drains running along the building's long sides, and cast concrete feet which support the trusses. There are sixteen trusses spanning the interior space. Each is composed of four curved half-trusses which are pinned at the foundations and at the apex where they meet. The two adjacent trusses are laced together at top and bottom chord level. Therefore, each half-truss consists of four timber chords sprung into arch form, with light timber bracing nailed into position to form a curved open-latticed box truss. The trusses are made entirely of sawn pieces of native hardwood nailed together.|$|E
50|$|The PrimeLines {{initiative}} in Coventry, England, is a £42 million budgeted scheme {{which aims to}} improve all aspects of bus journeys {{on a number of}} selected showcase routes radiating out from the city centre of Coventry. New bus stops will be wheelchair friendly, with <b>raised</b> <b>kerbs</b> for easier boarding, and new shelters, that are airier and well lit will be built.|$|R
50|$|A traffic {{island is}} a solid or painted object in a road that {{channels}} traffic. It {{can also be a}} narrow strip of island between roads that intersect at an acute angle. If the island uses road markings only, without <b>raised</b> <b>kerbs</b> or other physical obstructions, it is called a painted island or (especially in the UK) ghost island. Traffic islands can be used to reduce the speed of cars driving through.|$|R
50|$|As well {{as using}} the {{segregated}} busway in Kesgrave, the service also uses {{large sections of}} bus-lane running alongside normal traffic and traffic lights give priority to bus traffic. Bus stops served by the service have <b>raised</b> <b>kerbs,</b> high-quality bus shelters and larger stops have real-time information screens. Ticketing is carried out on-board by the driver and the prepay smartcard system used on Ipswich Buses services {{has not yet been}} implemented on First Eastern Counties services.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} remodelled over {{the turn of}} 2009 and 2010. A new {{entrance}} was built directly off the roundabout, with a new bus stop and shelter, and a <b>raised</b> <b>kerb.</b> The previous entrance and exit was widened as an exit, and buses {{are now able to}} use the site without doing the large turn or being affected and forced to reverse by badly parked vehicles. The rearrangement also provides more spaces. A new bus shelter was due to be installed at the site on 24 November 2009, leading to the closure of the site to buses from 11am, with temporary bus stops on the main road outside, although this didn't happen as planned. The site was closed at a later date for a longer period, with buses using stops on the main road for around a month. The newly remodelled site was completed on 22 January 2010, at which point buses started to enter the site again.|$|E
50|$|On-road cycle lanes vary. Some have <b>raised</b> {{concrete}} <b>kerbs</b> {{that separate}} people cycling from other traffic, whilst others {{are defined by}} lines painted on the road surface. The first Cycle Superhighways went into use in May 2010, and the first Quietways in 2016.|$|R
50|$|Cardiff Bus is the {{dominant}} bus operator in Cardiff and also serves Penarth, Sully, Barry and Llantwit Major. Its network consists of 64 routes using Scania OmniCity, Scania N230UD, East Lancs Olympus and bendy buses, Adl Enviro 200 Enviro 300 and Enviro 400 MMC, also use Dennis dart MPDs LMPDs and SPDs and Mercedes-Benz Citaros are also used. Cardiff Bus carries 100,000 passengers daily, has a turnover of £27million and employs around 720 people. The fleet and drivers are managed against a timetable using software systems supplied by UK based software supplier Omnibus Systems, which allows the real-time digital information displays positioned at many stops around the city, to inform people when the next bus is due and alerting waiting passengers of any delays. <b>Raised</b> <b>kerbs</b> have been installed at the majority of stops.|$|R
50|$|Several {{small changes}} {{were made to the}} circuit prior to the race. These include the <b>raising</b> of <b>kerbs</b> on the exit of the Nouvelle Chicane and {{in the second half of}} the Swimming Pool complex, as a {{deterrent}} to cars cutting the chicanes. The new kerbs were clearly visible in the new yellow colour. Several sections of the circuit, including the pit lane and the northern half of the circuit from the Place du Casino to the tunnel have been re-surfaced.|$|R
50|$|A low {{floor in}} the {{vehicular}} sense is normally combined in a conceptual meaning with normal pedestrian access from a standard kerb height. However, the accessibility of a low-floor vehicle can also be utilised from slightly <b>raising</b> portions of <b>kerb</b> at bus stops, or through use of level boarding bus rapid transit 'stations' or tram stops. The combination of access from a kerb was the technological development of the 1990s, as step-free interior layouts for buses had existed in some cases for decades, with entrance steps being introduced as chassis designs and overall height regulations changed.|$|R
50|$|Konta {{began the}} grass court swing in Nottingham, {{where she was}} the top seed. She reached the final, her first at Tour level on home soil and on grass, but was upset by Donna Vekić in the title match. The {{following}} week saw Konta eliminated {{in the second round}} in Birmingham. She then competed at the Eastbourne International. Following a bye into the second round, Konta beat Sorana Cîrstea, French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko and world number 1 Angelique Kerber to reach the semifinals. She pulled out of the tournament on the morning of her semifinal because of a back injury she sustained in her quarterfinal match against <b>Kerber,</b> <b>raising</b> questions over her fitness for Wimbledon the following week.|$|R
