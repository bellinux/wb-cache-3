5|$|Although she has {{campaigned on}} her husband's behalf since {{early in his}} {{political}} career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not <b>relish</b> <b>the</b> activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago {{asked if there was}} any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas. Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.|$|E
5|$|In 132, Zhang {{introduced}} an intricate seismoscope to the court, which he claimed could detect the precise cardinal {{direction of a}} distant earthquake. On one occasion his device indicated that an earthquake had occurred in the northwest. As there was no perceivable tremor felt in the capital his political enemies were briefly able to <b>relish</b> <b>the</b> failure of his device, until a messenger arrived shortly afterwards to report that an earthquake had occurred about 400km (248mi) to 500km (310mi) northwest of Luoyang in Gansu province.|$|E
5|$|That summer, Victoria and Albert spent a rainy {{holiday in}} the west of Scotland at Loch Laggan, but heard from their doctor, Sir James Clark, that his son had enjoyed dry, sunny days farther east at Balmoral Castle. The tenant of Balmoral, Sir Robert Gordon, died {{suddenly}} in early October, and Albert began negotiations {{to take over the}} lease from the owner, the Earl Fife. In May the following year, Albert leased Balmoral, which he had never visited, and in September 1848 he, his wife and the older children went there for the first time. They came to <b>relish</b> <b>the</b> privacy it afforded.|$|E

5|$|Tudor's {{plan was}} to export ice as a luxury good to wealthy members of West Indies and the {{southern}} US states, where he hoped they would <b>relish</b> <b>the</b> product during their sweltering summers; conscious of the risk that others might follow suit, Tudor hoped to acquire local monopoly rights in his new markets {{in order to maintain}} high prices and profits. He started by attempting to establish a monopoly on the potential ice trade in the Caribbean and invested in a brigantine ship to transport ice bought from farmers around Boston. At the time, Tudor was regarded by the business community at best as something of an eccentric, and at worst a fool.|$|E
5|$|Knox's {{powers as}} a preacher {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the chaplain of the garrison, John Rough. While Rough was preaching in the parish church on the Protestant principle of the popular election of a pastor, he proposed Knox to the congregation for that office. Knox did not <b>relish</b> <b>the</b> idea. According to his own account, he burst into tears and fled to his room. Within a week, however, he was giving his first sermon to a congregation that included his old teacher, John Major. He expounded on the seventh chapter of the Book of Daniel, comparing the Pope with the Antichrist. His sermon was marked by his consideration of the Bible as his sole authority and the doctrine of justification by faith alone, two elements that would remain in his thoughts throughout the rest of his life. A few days later, a debate was staged that allowed him to lay down additional theses including the rejection of the Mass, Purgatory, and prayers for the dead.|$|E

25|$|He {{stayed with}} the company after the merger that created Imperial Chemical Industries, despite being {{replaced}} as the research manager at Winnington by a non-chemist, Frank Bramwell, in 1927; Freeth was given a higher post in London, becoming Joint Research Manager with William Rintoul, but the change stung {{and he did not}} <b>relish</b> <b>the</b> bureaucratic nature of his new role. He retired from his research post in 1938 after a breakdown in 1937, but still did work for the company as a consultant, in addition to secret work for the government.|$|E
25|$|Tax matters: since IPC was a British-chartered company, the British {{groups would}} not have been subject to double taxation. The non-British groups, however, did not <b>relish</b> <b>the</b> idea of having the {{earnings}} of IPC taxed once by the British Government and again by their own governments. Eventually the groups agreed to transfer all pipeline operations to IPC, and price crude to the groups on the basis of management's estimate of British income tax cost plus 1 shilling profit per ton. Under this plan IPC's profits were nominal and its tax liability to the British Government was relatively small.|$|E
25|$|With {{the reason}} for the late arrival of help {{explained}} (the surveillance team got bored and watched the football instead), and Edna removed, Maurice has mixed reactions about the outcome – he got the suspect and the drugs, but he does not <b>relish</b> <b>the</b> prospect of explaining the missing money. He, Tracy and Tommy leave, and then Sam retrieves the real briefcase full of money from the extra secret compartment in the table that Maurice didn't know about. He promises Rosie a tomorrow richer in every way, and they disappear into the shower. Then Maurice and Tracy return and take the money, with Tracy giving Maurice a kiss. They depart, with Maurice quietly wishing Rosie the luck she'll need.|$|E

500|$|Accounts of McCool in his Somerset period portray {{him as a}} {{thoughtful}} but slightly aloof character. [...] "Off the field he was a quiet man," [...] wrote David Foot. He was [...] "a contemplative pipe-smoker {{in the corner of}} the dressing room," [...] says another account, and somewhat intolerant of others who appeared less committed than he was. [...] "Occasionally some of the younger pros didn't <b>relish</b> <b>the</b> way he treated them. Maybe they also resented that his salary was well in excess of their own." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{exhibition}} established Brooks' {{reputation as}} an artist. Reviews were effusive, and the poet Robert de Montesquiou wrote an appreciation calling her [...] "the thief of souls." [...] The restrained, almost monochromatic decor of her home also attracted attention; she was often asked to give advice on interior design, and sometimes did, though she did not <b>relish</b> <b>the</b> role of decorator. Brooks became increasingly disillusioned with Parisian high society, finding the conversation dull, and feeling that people were whispering about her. [...] Despite her artistic success, she described herself as a lapidéliterally, a victim of stoning.|$|E

500|$|People in Póvoa de Varzim {{observe a}} variety of festivals each year. The major celebration is Póvoa de Varzim Holiday, {{dedicated}} to Saint Peter. Neighbourhoods are decorated and, {{on the night of}} June 28 to 29, the population gathers in the streets and neighbourhoods compete in the rusgas carnival. The population behaves much like football supporters, when defending their preferred quarter. Families who emigrated to the United States and beyond, have been known to come back to Póvoa, time and again, simply to <b>relish</b> <b>the</b> spectacular feelings of excitement and community present at this festival. Easter Monday or Anjo festival is a remnant of a pagan festival, formerly called [...] "Festa da Hera" [...] (The Ivy Festival), in which several family picnics are held in the woods.|$|E
500|$|Writer Peter C. Newman {{concluded}} that [...] "Stursberg's rage dominates his crackling autobiography - as does his grief {{for the lost}} network's unfulfilled promise." [...] Columnist Martin Knelman, in the Toronto Star, advised, [...] "Don't expect a balanced account of the troubles that brewed. This is strictly the Gospel According to Richard - entertaining but also blatantly self-serving. ... He had no appetite for compromise, consensus or conciliation. He seemed to <b>relish</b> <b>the</b> chance to shock people, make them angry and create dramatic showdowns. Now with this book, he seizes the chance to attack those who stood in his way." [...] Knelman found the best parts were [...] "the passages where he goes after his perceived enemies with a hatchet", while Newman found [...] "the volume's most devastating profile [...] that of CBC president Hubert Lacroix".|$|E
500|$|Nova Scotia's well-entrenched {{system of}} paying off {{government}} supporters with jobs and contracts continued to flourish under the Macdonald Liberals. In his comprehensive history of Canadian patronage, journalist Jeffrey Simpson {{writes that the}} Liberals used road improvements to win votes, with highway crews [...] "especially busy before and during election campaigns." [...] Simpson adds that the Liberals awarded government contracts to companies approved by the party. In return, the firms were required to kickback {{some of the money}} they received to the Liberals. Biographer Stephen Henderson argues that Macdonald himself did not <b>relish</b> <b>the</b> traditional practice of filling government jobs with party supporters. Nevertheless, the [...] "wave of partisan hirings and firings" [...] continued as committees in each riding [...] "scrutinized employees for inappropriate political activity and rated prospective candidates based on what they or their families had done for the Liberal party".|$|E

500|$|In {{a meeting}} of Scots and Regulator leaders at Cross Creek on February 5, there was {{disagreement}} on how to proceed. [...] The Scots wanted {{to wait until the}} British troops had actually arrived before mustering, while the Regulators wanted to move immediately. [...] The views of the latter prevailed since they claimed to be able to raise 5,000 men, while the Scots expected to raise only 700 to 800. [...] When the forces mustered on February 15, there were about 3,500 men, but the number rapidly dwindled over the next few days. [...] Many men had expected to be met and escorted by British troops and did not <b>relish</b> <b>the</b> possibility of having to fight their way to the coast. [...] When they marched three days later, Brigadier General Donald MacDonald led between 1,400 and 1,600 men, predominantly Scots. This number was further reduced over the coming days as more men deserted the column.|$|E
500|$|Groves did not <b>relish</b> <b>the</b> {{prospect}} of explaining {{the loss of}} a billion dollars worth of plutonium to a Senate committee, so a cylindrical containment vessel codenamed [...] "Jumbo" [...] was constructed to recover the active material {{in the event of a}} failure. Measuring [...] long and [...] wide, it was fabricated at great expense from [...] of iron and steel by Babcock & Wilcox in Barberton, Ohio. Brought in a special railroad car to a siding in Pope, New Mexico, it was transported the last [...] to the test site on a trailer pulled by two tractors. By the time it arrived, confidence in the implosion method was high enough, and the availability of plutonium was sufficient, that Oppenheimer decided not to use it. Instead, it was placed atop a steel tower [...] from the weapon as a rough measure of how powerful the explosion would be. In the end, Jumbo survived, although its tower did not, adding credence to the belief that Jumbo would have successfully contained a fizzled explosion.|$|E
