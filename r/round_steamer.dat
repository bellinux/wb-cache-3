50|$|Mushiki are <b>round</b> <b>steamers</b> {{made from}} bamboo like {{those used in}} Chinese cuisine. They can be stacked {{on top of each}} other so that the steam can cook many {{different}} servings simultaneously. Seiro are large rectangular steamers made traditionally from bamboo but nowadays also often from metal. Seiro can also be stacked.|$|R

6000|$|We may not pause here to {{describe}} the picturesque confusion that ensued--the arriving, congregating, tacking, crossing, and re-crossing of smacks; the launching of little boats, and loading them with [...] "trunks;" [...] the concentration of these <b>round</b> the <b>steamer</b> like minnows <b>round</b> a whale; the shipping of the cargo, and the tremendous hurry and energy displayed in the desire to do it quickly, and get the fish fresh to market. Suffice {{it to say that}} in less than four hours the steamer was loaded, and Fred Martin, fever-stricken and with a highly inflamed hand and arm, started on a thirty-six hours' voyage to London.|$|R
60|$|At last {{he could}} see the spire of the little church on the hill, and when the <b>steamer</b> <b>rounded</b> the point, affording a full view of the town, and sounded her whistle as a signal for those on the shore to come to the pier, Toby could hardly {{restrain}} himself from jumping up and down and shouting in his delight.|$|R
50|$|Following a week's {{service in}} the Chesapeake Bay along its eastern shore and off {{the mouth of the}} Rappahannock River, the <b>steamer</b> <b>rounded</b> Cape Henry on 10 July and {{proceeded}} south to waters outside the bar off Hatteras Inlet to assist in sealing off the North Carolina coast. The ship's first action came on 11 July after a Confederate shore battery near Oregon Inlet opened fire on her. She answered with all her guns, knocked out one of the Confederate cannon, and drove the Southern soldiers from the area.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{nodded and}} glanced across the {{dazzling}} water towards the high, blue coast. He {{did not think}} the steamer could {{be seen from the}} land, and the launch would, no doubt, be invisible from her deck, but this was not important and he began to calculate {{how long it would take}} them to reach a point ahead. Some time later, he looked <b>round</b> again. The <b>steamer</b> was fading in the distance, but no smoke trailed behind her and he did not think she had started yet. His attention, however, was occupied by the headland he was steering for, because he thought it marked the neighborhood of their port.|$|R
60|$|<b>Round</b> {{went the}} <b>steamer,</b> and in went all her canvas. Ten {{minutes later the}} {{look-out}} saw a sail to the westward, standing before the wind. Odd as it might seem, the steamer's people now fancied they were sure of the Swash. There she was, coming directly for them, with squared yards! The distance was short, or a vessel {{could not have been}} seen by that light, and the two craft were soon near each other. A gun was actually cleared on board the steamer, ere it was ascertained that the stranger was the schooner! It was now midnight, and nothing was in sight but the coasting brig. Reluctantly, the revenue people gave the matter up; the Molly Swash having again eluded them, though by means unknown.|$|R
60|$|Once {{every three}} or four days, the {{collecting}} steamer came in sight; then there was a general race, in the fleet, to put the trunks of fish on board her. Each did his best to be in good time for, when the catch had been heavy, the steamer was sometimes unable to take the whole of it; in which case the portion left behind would be wholly spoilt, before the arrival of another steamer. The whole of the fleet, therefore, ran down towards the steamer as soon as she was seen; the heavy boats were tossed overboard, and the trunk lowered into them, and two hands jumped in to row them to the <b>steamer.</b> <b>Round</b> her a swarm of boats would soon be collected, each striving to get alongside, to deliver the fish.|$|R
60|$|They {{took the}} steamer for Massachusetts at five o'clock. When the band started to play, when Mother feared that a ferry {{was going to}} collide with them, when {{beautiful}} youths in boating hats popped out of state-rooms like chorus-men in a musical comedy, when children banged small sand-pails, when the <b>steamer</b> <b>rounded</b> the dream-castles of lower New York, when it seemed inconceivable that the flag-staff could get under Brooklyn Bridge--which didn't clear it by {{much more than a}} hundred feet--when a totally new New York of factories and docks, of steamers bound for Ceylon and yachts bound for Newport, was revealed to these old New-Yorkers--then Mother mingled a terrific apprehension regarding ships and water with a palpitating excitement over sailing into the freedom which these two gray-haired children had longed for all their lives, and had found during two weeks of each year.|$|R
60|$|The two men {{watched the}} <b>steamer</b> <b>round</b> the bend, then, {{ascending}} {{arm in arm}} {{the slope of the}} bank, returned to the station. They had been in this vast and dark country only a very short time, and as yet always in the midst of other white men, under the eye and guidance of their superiors. And now, dull as they were to the subtle influences of surroundings, they felt themselves very much alone, when suddenly left unassisted to face the wilderness; a wilderness rendered more strange, more incomprehensible by the mysterious glimpses of the vigorous life it contained. They were two perfectly insignificant and incapable individuals, whose existence is only rendered possible through the high organization of civilized crowds. Few men realize that their life, the very essence of their character, their capabilities and their audacities, are only the expression of their belief in the safety of their surroundings. The courage, the composure, the confidence; the emotions and principles; every great and every insignificant thought belongs not to the individual but to the crowd: to the crowd that believes blindly in the irresistible force of its institutions and of its morals, in the power of its police and of its opinion. But the contact with pure unmitigated savagery, with primitive nature and primitive man, brings sudden and profound trouble into the heart. To the sentiment of being alone of one's kind, to the clear perception of the loneliness of one's thoughts, of one's sensations--to the negation of the habitual, which is safe, there is added the affirmation of the unusual, which is dangerous; a suggestion of things vague, uncontrollable, and repulsive, whose discomposing intrusion excites the imagination and tries the civilized nerves of the foolish and the wise alike.|$|R
5000|$|The mystery deepened when on 2 September 1914, the Mercury {{provided}} {{further details}} of the event in their article [...] "The Norfolk Bay Tragedy - A mysterious occurrence - The {{details of the}} event"THE NORFOLK BAY TRAGEDY. A MYSTERIOUS OCCURRENCE. THE DETAILS OF THE EVENT.Fuller details which have come to hand of the drowning tragedy in Norfolk Bay, by which Mr. C. Wellard lost his life, show that the whole affair is a mystery.On the night before Mr. Wellard’s disappearance he stayed on the island with Mr. David Kingston, of Koonys. In the morning Mr. Wellard took several sheep out in his dinghy, {{and put them on}} board the s.s. Breone. He then went back to the island, and Mr Kingston helped him load the dinghy with six bags of fish manure, weighing some 7cwt ((approximately 317.5kg)), which, with a lamb in the bag and three dogs, formed the dinghy’s freight. Mr. Wellard then put out from the island in his dinghy, intending to cross to King George’s Sound {{on the west side of}} Forestier’s Peninsula and several miles from Garden Island, near which his home lay. The captain of the s.s. Breone offered to give him a tow for part of his journey, as the steamer would be going past the mouth of the Sound, and the dinghy was made fast to the steamer. As soon as the Breone got under way the captain noticed that the dinghy was slopping water over the bows. He then told Mr. Wellard he did not think the dinghy would stand towing, on which the latter asked him to cast off, which was at once done. The dinghy was then about 200 yards from the Garden Island jetty, but nor more than 60 or 70 yards from the nearest point on the island.When the dinghy was cast loose from the steamer, Mr. Wellard at once turned round and started to pull back to the jetty. Presumably he intended to get a bailer, as it was noticed that he had not one on board. The <b>steamer</b> <b>rounded</b> a point, and those on board lost sight of him before he reached the jetty.Mr. Wellard was never seen again, and what happened remains a mystery. He had no sail up at the time he was last seen. The dinghy is a stiff little boat, and it is hard to imagine how she got bottom upwards. The fact remains that she did turn over, and was found floating bottom upwards three days later. One of the dogs got on the bottom of the boat, and had been there three days and three nights before the boat was found.The deepest sympathy is felt for Mr. Wellard’s family and relatives. He was a young man in the prime of life, with a wife and two young children. He had established a farm and orchard in the bush, near Murdunna, and was working hard with good prospects of success.On 4 September 1914, S. N. Wellard discussed his nephew's death in the Mercury in his letter entitled 'Norfolk Bay Tragedy'.:To the Editor of [...] "The Mercury". Sir, —Being the late Charles Wellard's uncle and owner of Garden Island, I would like to explain to the public how I think the sad accident occurred. After driving the sheep on the s. s. Breonce (I would like here to say there is a good jetty on Garden Island, and all stock is loaded from it) Mr. David Kingston helped me to load the dinghy with fish manure. The dinghy is 14 ft. long and about 5 ft. beam, and thoroughly sea-worthy. No doubt, after being towed a short distance by the vessel, he re-turned to the Island, bailed out and made another start with a full load. A north-east wind sprang up when he was crossing, a little slop was going over and wetting the manure making it very much heavier. Mr. Kingston said he put the load in the bow of the boat, a very unusual thing for him to do and he was sitting down on the well (which was corked up) pulling. No doubt when he saw danger he threw the bag off the well, it being easy to get at. This would most likely cause the boat to go down head foremost, and roll over. Mr Dalton, from the opposite shore saw a dinghy about noon three-parts of the way across to the mainland. When he returned to his work he could not see it, and he presumed it was someone fishing who had gone home. It was also seen by Mr Dodridge, of Dunalley, about the same time. A bailer was picked up with name on it and several other things on Chronicle Point [...] Yours, etc., S. N. WELLARD.|$|R
