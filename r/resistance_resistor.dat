40|$|Abstract—Precision {{electrical}} trimming of stacked Si/SiGe poly-crystalline resistors {{available from}} the extrinsic base structure of a SiGe BiCMOS technology has been demonstrated for the first time. It is shown that pulse current trimming techniques {{can be used to}} trim the poly-SiGe resistors by up to 50 % from their orig-inal values with accuracy better than 0. 5 %. The temperature co-efficient of resistance (TCR) is shown to be linearly proportional to the percent change in electrically trimmed poly-SiGe resistance. Fi-nally, we demonstrate resistance cycling using an electrical trim/re-covery sequence, indicating that the technique is reversible and is governed by dopant segregation/diffusion mechanisms. The results are consistent with those obtained on conventional polysilicon re-sistors suggesting that the introduction of a strained SiGe layer does not adversely affect the electrical trim properties of these re-sistors.

40|$|Microelectronic {{manufacturing}} progresses {{not only}} towards further miniaturisation, but also application fields {{tend to become}} more and more diverse. Recently there has been an increasing demand for electronic devices and circuits that function in harsh environments such as high temperatures. Under these conditions, reliability aspects are highly critical and testing remains a great challenge. A versatile CMOS process based on 200 mm thin film Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) wafers is in production at Fraunhofer IMS. It features three layers of tungsten metallisation for optimum electromigration reliability, voltage independent capacitors, high <b>resistance</b> <b>resistors</b> and single-poly-EEPROM cells. Non-volatile memories such as EEPROMs are a key technology that enables flexible data storage, for example of calibration and measurement information. The reliability of these devices is especially crucial in high temperature applications since charge loss is drastically increased in this case. The behaviour of single-poly- EEPROM cells, produced in the process described before, was evaluated up to 450 °C. Data retention tests at temperatures ranging from 160 °C to 450 °C and write/erase cycling tests up to 400 °C were performed. The dependence of write/erase cycling on both temperature and tunnel oxide thickness was studied. These data provide an important foundation to extend the application of high temperature electronics to its maximum limits. The results show that EEPROM cells can be used for special applications even at temperatures higher than 250 °C...|$|R

With Silicon-on-Insulator-technologies (SOI), digital and analog {{circuitry}} is possible up to 250 °C and even more, but performance and reliability are strongly affected at these high temperatures. One of the main critical factors is the gate oxide quality and its reliability. In this paper, we present a study of gate oxide capacitor time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) measurements at temperatures up to 350 °C. The experiments were carried out on gate oxide capacitor structures which were realized in the Fraunhofer 1. 0 µm SOI-CMOS process. This technology is based on 200 mm wafers and features, among others, three layers of tungsten metallization with excellent reliability concerning electromigration, voltage independent capacitors, high <b>resistance</b> <b>resistors,</b> and single-poly-EEPROM cells. The gate oxide thickness is about 40 nm. Using the data of the TDDB-measurements, the behavior of field and temperature acceleration parameters at temperatures up to 350 °C was evaluated. For a more detailed investigation, the current evaluation with time was also studied. An analysis of the oxide breakdown conditions, which means especially the field and temperature dependence of the charge to breakdown and the current just before breakdown, completes the study. The presented data provide important information about accelerated oxide reliability testing beyond 250 °C {{in order to obtain}} information in short time about the reliability of high temperature CMOS-technologies at use-temperature...|$|R

Inductive reactance is strongly frequency dependent. At low frequency the reactance falls, and for a steady current (zero frequency) the inductor behaves as a short-circuit. At increasing frequency, on the other hand, the reactance increases and at a sufficiently high frequency the inductor approaches an open circuit.|$|R
