In an experiment by Gratton, Coles, Sirevaag, Erikson, and Donchin in 1988, the time of response initiation, defined as the latency of onset of EMG activity, was examined {{in relation to the}} LRP. It was found that the timing of response initiation was consistently associated with a particular LRP voltage, which can then be thought of as the <b>response</b> <b>threshold.</b> When subjects are instructed to then inhibit an overt response, there is a decrease in the magnitude as well as a delay in the latency of the LRP for successful inhibitions.

50|$|The {{most popular}} current model of {{self-organization}} in ants {{and other social}} insects is the <b>response</b> <b>threshold</b> model. A threshold for a particular task {{is the amount of}} stimulus, such as a pheromone or interactions with other workers, necessary to cause the worker to perform the associated task. A higher threshold requires a stronger stimulus, and thus translates into less preference for performing a specific task. Different workers have different thresholds for different tasks, allowing certain workers to function as specialists that preferentially perform one or more tasks. Threshold levels can be affected by several factors: worker age, since workers frequently switch from within-nest work to outside-nest work with age; size, since larger workers often perform different tasks, such as defense or seed processing; caste; health, since injuries can encourage young workers to switch to outside-nest work earlier; or be randomly distributed. As demand for a task increases, so does the proportion of workers whose thresholds are met; as demand decreases, fewer workers' thresholds are met and fewer workers are allocated to that task. In this way, simple individual rules allow for the regulation of work on a large scale in diverse settings. This system can also evolve in response to different environments and life history strategies, leading to the immense variation observed in ants.|$|E

40|$|When {{people make}} {{decisions}} they often face opposing demands for response speed and response accuracy, a process likely mediated by <b>response</b> <b>thresholds.</b> According to the striatal hypothesis, people decrease <b>response</b> <b>thresholds</b> by increasing activation from cortex to striatum, releasing the brain from inhibition. According to the STN hypothesis, people decrease <b>response</b> <b>thresholds</b> by decreasing activation from cortex to subthalamic nucleus (STN); {{a decrease in}} STN activity is likewise thought to release the brain from inhibition and result in responses that are fast but error-prone. To test these hypotheses – both {{of which may be}} true – we conducted two experiments on perceptual decision making in which we used cues to vary the demands for speed vs. accuracy. In both experiments, behavioral data and mathematical model analyses confirmed that instruction from the cue selectively affected the setting of <b>response</b> <b>thresholds.</b> In the first experiment, we used ultra high-resolution 7 T structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to locate the STN precisely. We then used 3 T structural MRI and probabilistic tractography to quantify the connectivity between the relevant brain areas. The results showed that participants who flexibly change <b>response</b> <b>thresholds</b> (as quantified by the mathematical model) have strong structural connections between pre-supplementary motor area and striatum. This result was confirmed in an independent second experiment. In general, these findings show that individual differences in elementary cognitive tasks are partly driven by structural differences in brain connectivity.

40|$|Abstract Background Bacterial species {{present in}} multispecies {{microbial}} communities often {{react to the}} same chemical signal but at vastly different concentrations. The existence of different <b>response</b> <b>thresholds</b> {{with respect to the}} same signal molecule has been well documented in quorum sensing {{which is one of the}} best studied inter-cellular signalling mechanisms in bacteria. The biological significance of this phenomenon is still poorly understood, and cannot be easily studied in nature or in laboratory models. The aim of this study is to establish the role of differential signal <b>response</b> <b>thresholds</b> in stabilizing microbial communities. Results We tested binary competition scenarios using an agent-based model in which competing bacteria had different response levels with respect to signals, cooperation factors or both, respectively. While in previous scenarios fitter species outcompete slower growing competitors, we found that stable equilibria could form if the fitter species responded to a higher chemical concentration level than the slower growing competitor. We also found that species secreting antibiotic could form a stable community with other competing species if antibiotic production started at higher <b>response</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Conclusions Microbial communities in nature rely on the stable coexistence of species that necessarily differ in their fitness. We found that differential <b>response</b> <b>thresholds</b> provide a simple and elegant way for keeping slower growing species within the community. High <b>response</b> <b>thresholds</b> can be considered as self-restraint of the fitter species that allows metabolically useful but slower growing species to remain within a community, and thereby the metabolic repertoire of the community will be maintained.

5000|$|Insulin {{resistance}} {{implies that}} the body's cells (primarily muscle) lose sensitivity to insulin, a hormone secreted by the pancreas to promote glucose utilization. At the molecular level, a cell senses insulin through insulin receptors, with the signal propagating through a cascade of molecules collectively known as PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Recent studies suggested that the pathway may operate as a bistable switch under physiologic conditions for certain types of cells, and insulin response {{may well be a}} threshold phenomenon. [...] The pathway's sensitivity to insulin may be blunted by many factors such as free fatty acids, causing insulin resistance. From a broader perspective, however, sensitivity tuning (including sensitivity reduction) is a common practice for an organism to adapt to the changing environment or metabolic conditions. Pregnancy, for example, is a prominent change of metabolic conditions, under which the mother has to reduce her muscles' insulin sensitivity to spare more glucose for the brains (the mother's brain and the fetal brain). This can be achieved through raising the <b>response</b> <b>threshold</b> (i.e., postponing the onset of sensitivity) by secreting placental growth factor to interfere with the interaction between insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and PI3K, which is the essence of the so-called adjustable threshold hypothesis of insulin resistance.|$|E

In contrast, increased response conservativeness is associated with activation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) (Frank et al., 2007). We investigated the involvement of these regions in trial-by-trial adjustments of <b>response</b> <b>threshold</b> in humans, using a cued-trials task-switching paradigm. Fully and partially informative switch cues produced more conservative thresholds than repeat cues. Repeat cues were associated with higher activation in pre-SMA and striatum than switch cues. For all cue types, individual variability in <b>response</b> <b>threshold</b> was associated with activation level in pre-SMA, with higher activation linked to lower threshold setting. In the striatum, this relationship was found for repeat cues only. These findings {{support the notion that}} pre-SMA biases the striatum to lower <b>response</b> <b>threshold</b> under more liberal response regimens. In contrast, a high threshold for switch cues was associated with greater activation in right STN, consistent with increasing response caution under conservative response regimens.

Four colonies were repeatedly exposed to increasing temperature and CO-sub- 2 levels. The <b>response</b> <b>threshold</b> of each worker (defined as the mean stimulus intensity at which a worker responded by fanning) was determined. Temperature response thresholds of 118 workers and CO-sub- 2 response thresholds of 88 workers were analyzed. Workers differed in their response thresholds.

No consistent correlation between temperature and CO-sub- 2 thresholds was found within individuals. Response thresholds of fanning bees decreased over successive trials, providing empirical support for the idea of specialization through individual threshold reinforcement. In addition to variability in individual response thresholds, workers of a colony differed in two other parameters of responsiveness: response probability (the probability of responding to a stimulus once it exceeded an individual's <b>response</b> <b>threshold)</b> and response duration (the persistency with which fanning was performed once an individual responded).

40|$|One of {{the most}} elusive but {{important}} goals of swarm robotics is to reproduce the emergent collaborative behavior observed in natural swarming systems {{through the use of}} simple decision rules. Examples of collaborative processes in insect colonies such as foraging, scouting (finding shortest paths) for food, and colony defense involve some form of task allocation among individual agents. The robustness of task completion even after major environmental changes is also observed in natural swarm systems. Ants and bees are often unphased {{by the fact that the}} magnitude of a task [...] - such as carrying a heavy piece of food [...] - is unknown to every individual and manage to complete the task elegantly even without such critical knowledge. This robustness property is of paramount importance when recreating natural behavior in artificial systems and I believe the use of decentralized agent based task allocation rules is closely related to this property. I therefore present a novel <b>response</b> <b>threshold</b> based strategy for task allocation in multi-agent systems in this dissertation. I prove, using a well known result from the theory of global games, that under the constraints of imperfect knowledge of the environment and imperfect communication <b>response</b> <b>threshold</b> based task allocation leads to an equilibrium inducing strategy for the swarm system. The importance of this result is to provide a formal mathematical basis for the phenomenological justification currently provided in the field of swarm robotics to mimic biological systems. This result therefore provides both, a hypothesis about the inner workings of a wide range of existing approaches with limited communication between agents in artificial swarm systems and also a formal explanation for threshold based task allocation in social insects. These game theory results lead to a novel continuous <b>response</b> <b>threshold</b> algorithm for multi-agent task allocation that generalizes fixed-group task allocation (stick-pulling experiment) and stochastic team size task allocation. This allows variable team sizes to form at task sites within tolerance limits thereby providing a trade-off between exploration and exploitation.

Further simulation experiments provide a basis of comparison between optimal centralized approaches and hybrid approaches for task allocation where each robot decides whether to participate in a task based on its own noisy sensory input and imperfect knowledge from the system controller.

40|$|A {{model of}} {{division}} of labour in insect societies based on variable <b>response</b> <b>thresholds</b> is introduced. <b>Response</b> <b>thresholds</b> refer to likelihood of reacting to task-associated stimuli. Low threshold individuals perform tasks at {{a lower level of}} stimulus than high threshold individuals.

This combined reinforcement process leads to the emergence of specialized workers, that is, workers that are more responsive to stimuli associated with particular task requirements, from a group of initially identical individuals. Predictions of the dynamics of task specialization resulting from this model are presented. Predictions are also made as to what should be observed when specialists of a given task are removed from the colony and reintroduced after a varying amount of time: the colony does not recover the same state as prior to the perturbation and the difference between before and after the perturbation is more strongly marked as the time between separation and reintroduction increases. ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryColonies {{of social}} insects display an amazing degree of {{flexibility}} in dealing with long-term and short-term perturbations in their environment. The key organizational element of insect societies is division of labor. Recent literature suggests that interindividual variability in <b>response</b> <b>thresholds</b> {{plays an important role}} in the emergence of division of labor among workers (reviewed in [1, 2]). Genetic variation can only partly explain the variability among workers. Here we document the effects of both preimaginal and adult thermal experience on the behavioral differentiation of Camponotus rufipes ant workers. We show that preimaginal temperature (22 °C or 32 °C during pupal stage) affects temperature-response thresholds and temperature preferences of adult brood-tending workers. We further show that brood-carrying experience gathered as adult during several repeated temperature increases modifies thermal behavior. Experienced workers showed a faster transition from first sensing the temperature stimulus to responding with brood translocation. Developmental plasticity of workers provides a colony with flexibility in dealing with thermal variations and constitutes an important mechanism underlying interindividual variability.

Inter- and intraspecific recognition in the form of overt aggression varies in the genus Reticulitermes. Three patterns have emerged from nestmate recognition studies in termites: 1) interspecific aggression is often stronger and more immediate than intraspecific aggression, 2) a loss of genetic diversity may result in a loss of aggression, 3) with laboratory bioassays, single individuals don't show overt aggression, whereas groups do. We create an agent-based model that simulates these patterns to understand the mechanisms that create them. We assume that there are three components to successful recognition of alien individuals: the variation in recognition cues among different colonies, signaling among individuals in the same colony, and variation in <b>response</b> <b>thresholds</b> of individuals within the same colony. The results suggest that if cue difference is not significantly variable, and <b>response</b> <b>thresholds</b> are high, aggressive behavior will not be expressed.

Division of labor models indicate how individuals distribute themselves in order to perform different tasks simultaneously. However, models that study division of labor from a dynamical system point of view cannot {{be found in the}} literature. In this paper, we define a division of labor model as a discrete-time dynamical system, in order to study the equilibrium points and their properties related to convergence and stability. By making use of this analytical model, an adaptive algorithm based on division of labor can be designed to satisfy dynamic criteria. In this way, we have designed and tested an algorithm that varies the <b>response</b> <b>thresholds</b> in order to modify the dynamic behavior of the system. This behavior modification allows the system to adapt to specific environmental and collective situations, making the algorithm a good candidate for distributed control applications. The variable threshold algorithm is based on specialization mechanisms. It is able to achieve an asymptotically stable behavior of the system in different environments and independently of the number of individuals. The algorithm has been successfully tested under several initial conditions and number of individuals.

Decreased nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) thresholds (spinal cord hyperexcitability) are a feature of chronic whiplash but have not been investigated in the acute to chronic injury stage. This study compared the temporal development of sensory hypersensitivity and NFR responses from soon after injury to either recovery or to transition to chronicity. It also aimed to identify predictors of persistent spinal cord hyperexcitability.
