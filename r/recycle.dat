The <b>recycled</b> {{aggregate}} is {{dealt with}} in three ways, the first way {{is to keep the}} <b>recycled</b> aggregate intact; the second way is to wrap the <b>recycled</b> aggregate in cement slurry of Water-cement ratio 0. 55 for 30 minutes, and then place it at room temperature for 7 days; the third way is to immerse the <b>recycled</b> aggregate in water for 24 hours. Three kinds of different <b>recycled</b> aggregate is separately used for mixing of <b>recycled</b> concrete. The strength and slump of <b>recycled</b> concrete with different <b>recycled</b> coarse aggregate contents are tested. Experiments show that the <b>recycled</b> concrete produced by using the <b>recycled</b> aggregate immersed in water and selecting a suitable mix has the higher strength and slump, which can be industrialized. And then, the <b>recycled</b> concrete with 40 % <b>recycled</b> coarse aggregate contents is used in the steel-reinforced <b>recycled</b> concrete beams, which are tested, the failure process of steel-reinforced <b>recycled</b> concrete beams,section strains and maximum load are acquired.

5|$|Due to the {{presence}} of valence 5f electrons, neptunium and its alloys exhibit very interesting magnetic behavior, like many other actinides. These can range from the itinerant band-like character characteristic of the transition metals to the local moment behavior typical of scandium, yttrium, and the lanthanides. This stems from 5f-orbital hybridization with the orbitals of the metal ligands, {{and the fact that the}} 5f orbital is relativistically destabilized and extends outwards. For example, pure neptunium is paramagnetic, NpAl3 is ferromagnetic, NpGe3 has no magnetic ordering, and NpSn3 behaves fermionically. Investigations are underway regarding alloys of neptunium with uranium, americium, plutonium, zirconium, and iron, so as to <b>recycle</b> long-lived waste isotopes such as neptunium-237 into shorter-lived isotopes more useful as nuclear fuel.|$|E

5|$|Insect ecology is the {{scientific}} study of how insects, individually or as a community, interact with the surrounding environment or ecosystem. Insects play {{one of the most important}} roles in their ecosystems, which includes many roles, such as soil turning and aeration, dung burial, pest control, pollination and wildlife nutrition. An example is the beetles, which are scavengers that feed on dead animals and fallen trees and thereby <b>recycle</b> biological materials into forms found useful by other organisms. These insects, and others, are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created.|$|E
5|$|Lysosomes are organelles {{that contain}} hydrolytic enzymes {{that are used}} for {{intracellular}} digestion. The main functions of a lysosome are to process molecules taken in by the cell and to <b>recycle</b> worn out cell parts. The enzymes inside of lysosomes are acid hydrolases which require an acidic environment for optimal performance. Lysosomes provide such an environment by maintaining a pH of 5.0 inside of the organelle. If a lysosome were to rupture, the enzymes released would not be very active because of the cytosol's neutral pH. However, if numerous lysosomes leaked the cell could be destroyed from autodigestion.|$|E
5|$|Lysosomes {{carry out}} {{intracellular}} digestion, {{in a process}} called phagocytosis (from the Greek phagein, to eat and kytos, vessel, referring here to the cell), by fusing with a vacuole and releasing their enzymes into the vacuole. Through this process, sugars, amino acids, and other monomers pass into the cytosol and become nutrients for the cell. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to <b>recycle</b> the cell's obsolete organelles in a process called autophagy. The lysosome engulfs another organelle and uses its enzymes to take apart the ingested material. The resulting organic monomers are {{then returned to the}} cytosol for reuse. The last function of a lysosome is to digest the cell itself through autolysis.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the mechanical and durable properties of <b>recycled</b> aggregate concrete (RAC) for using in concrete. The porosity of <b>recycled</b> coarse aggregates is known to influence the fresh and hardened concrete properties and these properties are related to the specific mass of the <b>recycled</b> coarse aggregates, which directly influences the mechanical properties of the concrete. The <b>recycled</b> aggregates were obtained from construction and demolition wastes (CDW), which were divided into <b>recycled</b> sand (fine) and coarse aggregates. Besides this, a <b>recycled</b> coarse aggregate of a specific mass with a greater density was obtained by mixing the <b>recycled</b> aggregates of the CDW with the <b>recycled</b> aggregates of concrete wastes (CW). The concrete was produced in laboratory by combining three water-cement ratios, the ratios were used in agreement with NBR 6118 for structural concretes, with each <b>recycled</b> coarse aggregates and <b>recycled</b> sand or river sand, and the reference concrete was produced with natural aggregates. It was observed that <b>recycled</b> aggregates can be used in concrete with properties for structural concrete. In general, the use of <b>recycled</b> coarse aggregate in combination with <b>recycled</b> sand did not provide good results; but when the less porous was used, or the <b>recycled</b> coarse aggregate of a specific mass with a greater density, the properties of the concrete showed better results.

5|$|One {{possibility}} is that the Dressel 20 amphora, the principal type found at Monte Testaccio, may have been unusually difficult to <b>recycle.</b> Many types of amphora could be re-used to carry {{the same type of}} product or modified to serve a different purpose—for instance, as drain pipes or flower pots. Fragmentary amphorae could be pounded into chips to use in opus signinum, a type of concrete widely used as a building material, or could simply be used as landfill. The Dressel 20 amphora, however, broke into large curved fragments that could not readily be reduced to small shards. It is likely that the difficulty of reusing or repurposing the Dressel 20s meant that it was more economical to discard them.|$|E

5|$|Probably {{the easiest}} to <b>recycle</b> would be bismuth-containing fusible alloys {{in the form of}} larger objects, then larger {{soldered}} objects. Half of the world's solder consumption is in electronics (i.e., circuit boards). As the soldered objects get smaller or contain little solder or little bismuth, the recovery gets progressively more difficult and less economic, although solder with a higher silver content will be more worthwhile recovering. Next in recycling feasibility would be sizeable catalysts with a fair bismuth content, perhaps as bismuth phosphomolybdate, and then bismuth used in galvanizing and as a free-machining metallurgical additive.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Low, {{medium and}} high {{variability}} of aggregates of concrete were designed and prepared {{and the influence}} of variability of <b>recycled</b> aggregates on the mechanical properties and durability of concretes was investigated.

5|$|Worker {{termites}} {{undertake the}} most labour within the colony, {{being responsible for}} foraging, food storage, and brood and nest maintenance. Workers are tasked with the digestion of cellulose in food and are thus the most likely caste {{to be found in}} infested wood. The process of worker termites feeding other nestmates is known as trophallaxis. Trophallaxis is an effective nutritional tactic to convert and <b>recycle</b> nitrogenous components. It frees the parents from feeding all but the first generation of offspring, allowing for the group to grow much larger and ensuring that the necessary gut symbionts are transferred from one generation to another. Some termite species do not have a true worker caste, instead relying on nymphs that perform the same work without differentiating as a separate caste.|$|E
5|$|Grass is the guinea pig's natural diet. Their molars are {{particularly}} suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal's life. Most grass-eating mammals are quite large {{and have a}} long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents, they must also supplement their diet by coprophagy, the eating of their own feces. However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft pellets, called cecotropes, which <b>recycle</b> B vitamins, fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion. The cecotropes (or caecal pellets) are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese. They share this behaviour with rabbits. In geriatric boars or sows (the condition is rarer in young ones), the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus for consumption can become weak. This creates a condition known as anal impaction, which prevents the boar from redigesting cecotropes, though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass. The condition may be temporarily alleviated by carefully expelling the impacted feces.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of building rubble collected from damaged and demolished structures {{is an important}} issue in every country. After crushing and screening, this material could serve as <b>recycled</b> aggregate in concrete. A series of experiments using <b>recycled</b> aggregate of various compositions from building rubble was conducted. The test results show that the building rubble could be transformed into useful <b>recycled</b> aggregate through proper processing. Using unwashed <b>recycled</b> aggregate in concrete will affect its strength. The effect will be more obvious at lower water/cement ratios. When the <b>recycled</b> aggregate was washed, these negative effects were greatly improved. This is especially true for the flexural strength of the <b>recycled</b> concrete. The <b>recycled</b> coarse aggregate is the weakest phase at a low water/cement ratio. This effect will dominate the strength of <b>recycled</b> concrete. This mechanism does not occur in <b>recycled</b> mortar. The quantity of <b>recycled</b> fine aggregate will govern the mortar strength. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
