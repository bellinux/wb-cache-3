25|$|The first exhibit {{visitors}} {{encountered in}} 1935 was the Foucault pendulum, {{which was designed}} to demonstrate the rotation of the Earth. The exhibits also included a 12-inch (305mm) Zeiss refracting telescope in the east dome, a triple-beam coelostat (solar telescope) in the west dome, and a thirty-eight foot <b>relief</b> <b>model</b> of the moon's north polar region.|$|E
25|$|Income {{grants are}} argued to be vastly more {{efficient}} in extending basic needs {{to the poor}} than subsidizing supplies whose effectiveness in poverty alleviation is diluted by the non-poor who enjoy the same subsidized prices. With cars and other appliances, the wealthiest 20% of Egypt uses about 93% of the country's fuel subsidies. In some countries, fuel subsidies are a larger part of the budget than health and education. A 2008 study concluded that {{the money spent on}} in-kind transfers in India in a year could lift all India's poor out of poverty for that year if transferred directly. The primary obstacle argued against direct cash transfers is the impractically for poor countries of such large and direct transfers. In practice, payments determined by complex iris scanning are used by war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo and Afghanistan, while India is phasing out its fuel subsidies in favor of direct transfers. Additionally, in aid models, the famine <b>relief</b> <b>model</b> increasingly used by aid groups calls for giving cash or cash vouchers to the hungry to pay local farmers instead of buying food from donor countries, often required by law, as it wastes money on transport costs.|$|E
40|$|Techniques for {{enhancing}} physical landscape models with dynamic maps and imagery, termed Projected Augmented <b>Relief</b> <b>Models</b> (PARM), {{are part of}} a revival of interest in the power of <b>relief</b> <b>models</b> as tools for geographic visualization. This method enables the creation of dynamic and engaging public displays, which appear attractive but also promote discussion and interaction as revealed through direct observation and video. This paper explores the capabilities of physical <b>relief</b> <b>models</b> as tangible displays for geographic information, and considers the role of interaction using the Kinect sensor for finger detection. The focus of interaction is on making solid landscape models of real geographic areas reactive to touch...|$|R
50|$|Global <b>relief</b> <b>models</b> {{are always}} based on {{combinations}} of data sets from different remote sensing techniques. This {{is because there}} is no single remote sensing technique that would allow measurement of the relief both over dry and water-covered areas. Elevation data over land is often obtained from LIDAR or inSAR measurements, while bathymetry is acquired based on SONAR and altimetry. Global <b>relief</b> <b>models</b> may also contain elevations of the bedrock (sub-ice-topography) below the ice shields of Greenland and Antarctica. Ice sheet thickness, mostly measured through ice-penetrating RADAR, is subtracted from the ice surface heights to reveal the bedrock.|$|R
40|$|<b>Relief</b> <b>models</b> are a {{peculiar}} type of cartographic products. These models are usually hand-made or produced in {{small number of}} copies, so their digital archiving is very important. There are special tools for this task, but these equipments are rather ex-pensive, and libraries or other institutes that usually own these models cannot spend too much. The authors developed a method which uses the Hypr 3 D free on-line tool to create digital 3 D representation of <b>relief</b> <b>models</b> using a set of photographs as source. This tool creates point cloud and textured triangle mesh based on matching patterns on the photos. This paper introduces the method, discusses the details of successful photographing and the possible post-processing of the results...|$|R
2500|$|The 340-acre (1.4km²) site {{included}} a [...] <b>relief</b> <b>model</b> of the Panama Canal, {{a wild animal}} show, a Wild West show, and a re-creation of the then-recent San Francisco earthquake. Possibly the most popular attraction was a re-creation of the Battle of Hampton Roads, the first battle between two ironclad warships, the USS Monitor and the CSS Virginia, which had taken place within sight of Sewell's Point 40 years earlier during the Civil War. The exterior of the Merrimac-Monitor Building looked somewhat like a battleship, while the interior held a large, circular exhibit describing the battle.|$|E
50|$|A global <b>relief</b> <b>model,</b> {{sometimes}} also denoted {{as global}} topography model or composite model, combines {{digital elevation model}} (DEM) data over land with digital bathymetry model (DBM) data over water-covered areas (oceans, lakes) to describe Earth’s relief. A <b>relief</b> <b>model</b> thus shows how Earth’s surface would look like {{in the absence of}} water or ice masses.|$|E
50|$|Under {{negative}} state <b>relief</b> <b>model,</b> helping behaviours {{are motivated}} by one’s egoistic desires. In Manucia’s study (1979), the hedonistic nature of helping behaviour was revealed and negative <b>relief</b> <b>model</b> was supported. Subjects were divided into 3 groups - happy, neutral and sad mood groups. Half of the subjects in each group were made {{to believe that their}} induced mood was fixed temporarily. Another half group believed that their mood was changeable. The results showed that saddened subjects helped more when they believed that their mood was changeable. The results supported the egoistic nature of helping behaviours as well as the negative state <b>relief</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E
50|$|The central square, {{which has}} a church and town hall, is called San Roque. Important attractions are the {{different}} squares, and the Paseo the Gran Canaria, where a 30 meter high waterfall has been laid out, as well as <b>relief</b> <b>models</b> of the different islands.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the 1990s, the building's poor state and the moving of Vauban's <b>relief</b> <b>models</b> of {{fortified}} towns to Lille forced the town to renovate the building. Work began in 1991, under the architects Jean-Marc Ibos and Myrto Vitart, and was completed in 1997. This allowed {{the creation of a new}} 700 m² basement room for temporary exhibitions, as well as departments for the <b>relief</b> <b>models</b> and for 19th-century sculpture. Overall the museum covers 22000 m² and held 72430 pieces in 2015, one of the largest collections of fine arts in province. Its sculptures, paintings, drawings, ceramics and so on include works by Raphael, Donatello, Van Dyck, Tissot, Jordaens, Rembrandt, Goya, El Greco, David, Corot, Courbet, Toulouse-Lautrec, Delacroix, Rubens, Rodin, Claudel and Jean-Baptiste Chardin.|$|R
50|$|The {{relief is}} {{represented}} {{by a set of}} heights (elevations or depths) that refer to some height reference surface, often the mean sea level or the geoid. Global <b>relief</b> <b>models</b> are used for a variety of applications including visualisation, geological, geomorphological and geophysical analyses, gravity field modelling as well as geo-statistics.|$|R

50|$|In 1786, the {{industrialist}} Johann Rudolf Meyer, {{who came}} from Aarau, decided to create a map of Switzerland at his own expense. For that purpose, he engaged a geometer, Johann Heinrich Weiss of Strasbourg. The foundations for Meyer's map were baseline measurements by the scientist Johann Georg Tralles and landscape <b>relief</b> <b>modelling</b> by Joachim Eugen Müller, after which Weiss drew the map.|$|R
40|$|Although the Velebit {{is a low}} {{mountain}} {{situated in}} the moderate climate zone, there exist periglacial processes in <b>relief</b> <b>modelling</b> in its highest part. The {{reason for this is}} interdependance of geological, geomorphological, climatic, vegetational and pedological influences, but also long antropogenic and zoogenic influences. Among periglacial forms the features which originated from the activity of nival and frost processes can be singled out...|$|R
50|$|The ETOPO1 1-arcmin global <b>relief</b> <b>model,</b> {{produced}} by the National Geophysical Data Center (Colorado), provides two layers of relief information. One layer represents the global relief including bedrock over Antarctica and Greenland, and another layer the global relief including ice surface heights. Both layers include bathymetry over the oceans and some of Earth’s major lakes. ETOPO1 land topography and ocean bathymetry relies on SRTM30 topography and a multitude of bathymetric surveys that have been merged. Historic versions of ETOPO1 are the ETOPO2 and ETOPO5 relief models (2 and 5 arc-min resolution).The ETOPO1 global <b>relief</b> <b>model</b> {{is based on the}} 2001 Bedmap1 model of bedrock over Antarctica, which is now superseded by the significantly improved Bedmap2 bedrock data. The ETOPO1-contained information on ocean depths is superseded through several updates of the SRTM30_PLUS bathymetry.|$|E

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to extend image-based relief generation to high-relief generation, as the images contain insufficient height information. To generate reliefs from three-dimensional (3 D) models, {{it is necessary to}} extract the height fields from the model, but this can only generate bas-reliefs. To overcome this problem, an efficient method is proposed to generate bas-reliefs and high-reliefs directly from 3 D meshes. To produce relief features that are visually appropriate, the 3 D meshes are first scaled. 3 D unsharp masking is used to enhance the visual features in the 3 D mesh, and average smoothing and Laplacian smoothing are implemented to achieve better smoothing results. A nonlinear variable scaling scheme is then employed to generate the final bas-reliefs and high-reliefs. Using the proposed method, <b>relief</b> <b>models</b> can be generated from arbitrary viewing positions with different gestures and combinations of multiple 3 D <b>models.</b> The generated <b>relief</b> <b>models</b> can be printed by 3 D printers. The proposed method provides a means of generating both high-reliefs and bas-reliefs in an efficient and effective way under the appropriate scaling factors...|$|R
40|$|Transsexualism {{is a rare}} disorder, {{and there}} is little {{literature}} available on its treatment. A case is presented of transsexualism with homosexual orientation in a 24 year old male. Since the disorder appeared to have behavioral antecedents, it was treated with a behavior therapy package comprising relaxation, aversion therapy with aversion <b>relief,</b> <b>modelling,</b> hypnosis, orgasmic reconditioning, behavioral counselling and sex education. Therapy resulted in normalization of gender identity, but the homosexual orientation persisted...|$|R

5000|$|Submarine {{elevation}} (known as bathymetry) data {{is generated}} using ship-mounted depth soundings. When land topography and bathymetry is combined, a truly Global <b>Relief</b> <b>Model</b> is obtained. The SRTM30Plus dataset (used in NASA World Wind) attempts to combine GTOPO30, SRTM and bathymetric data {{to produce a}} truly global elevation model. [...] The Earth2014 global topography and <b>relief</b> <b>model</b> [...] provides layered topography grids at 1 arc-minute resolution. Other than SRTM30plus, Earth2014 provides information on ice-sheet heights and bedrock (that is, topography below the ice) over Antarctica and Greenland. Another global model is Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED2010) with 7.5 arc second resolution. It is based on SRTM data and combines other data outside SRTM coverage. A novel global DEM of postings lower than 12 m and a height accuracy of less than 2 m is expected from the TanDEM-X satellite mission which started in July 2010.|$|E

40|$|The peak {{areas of}} the Velebit {{mountain}} range display an interesting periglacial geomorphology. The appearance of forms {{is the result of}} the interdependent geological, geomorphologic, climatic, vegetational and pedological characteristics of the area. The structural and lithological properties of the rock complex, and the inclination of the slope, play a significant role in periglacial <b>relief</b> <b>modelling.</b> Climatic elements are also important, as they influence the intensity and duration of the processes. Low temperatures and relatively high precipitation during the last ice age (Würm III), served to intensify the activity of periglacial processes and <b>relief</b> <b>modelling</b> of the entire Velebit area. Nivation and cryofraction are the predominant periglacial processes which are represented by snow avalanches and stone streams. Air temperatures and soil temperatures (at 30, 60, 90 cm depth) were measured, presented and reviewed, together with other attributes and the slope inclination of the area. The interactions between ground temperature, snow cover and wind patterns play important roles in frost action. In addition to slope inclination, the penetration of warm winds (jugo) and warming of snow on the NE slopes are also important factors in destabilizing the snow cover and triggering avalanches. Snow avalanches are most intensive on slopes with declinations from 35 ° up to 50 °, especially on the parts without vegetation cover. </span...|$|R
