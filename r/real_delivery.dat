40|$|BACKGROUND: Low-frequency and high-risk situations, such as {{neonatal}} resuscitation, are {{the ideal}} targets for simulation-based learning. The {{aim of this}} paper is to present the structure of our internal neonatal resuscitation training program, using a realistic, simulated delivery room, and to present the participants' opinions about teamwork, emotional stress, and their subjective ability to face a resuscitation. METHODS: We administered a training course to 24 doctors and midwives. One of the simulation classrooms was modified to appear similar to a <b>real</b> <b>delivery</b> room. Four scenarios were conducted using a previously designed checklist of primary and secondary goals. Upon completion, all students participated in a debriefing session with the help of a video review. RESULTS: Students rated the achievement of their previously defined goals on a scale of 1 to 5. Grouping together the percentages of the highest ratings (Categories 4 and 5), 83. 4 % (20 / 24) of the students considered the course useful for acquiring clinical skills. For 87. 5 % (21 / 24) of the students, the scenarios simulated real clinical situations, the room properly simulated a <b>real</b> <b>delivery</b> room, and the course improved the students' ability to work in a team. For 66. 6 % (16 / 24) of the students, the course improved their stress in confronting neonatal resuscitation. Initially, only 33. 3 % (8 / 24) of the students considered themselves very capable or fully able to cope with a resuscitation. After the course, that percentage rose to 62. 5 % (15 / 24). CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of simulation-based learning into neonatal resuscitation teaching programs, using realistic scenarios, is useful and offers the possibility of acquiring technical skills, but it also allows for the improvement of teamwork and the adoption of different roles and positive attitudes towards emotional stress...|$|E

Success rates per cycle have been reported, but not cumulative delivery rates for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). We selected retrospectively 498 Belgian patients 25 weeks. These couples underwent 953 ICSI cycles using fresh ejaculated spermatozoa. The indications for ICSI were long-standing severe male infertility or fertilization failure after conventional in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Cumulative delivery rates were calculated by life-table analysis and compared according to age groups and sperm quality. There were 298 deliveries within a mean rate per cycle of 31 %. The average number of cycles required for a delivery was 3. 15 (CI 2. 88; 3. 43). Twenty-three (4. 6 %) spontaneous pregnancies occurred after the patients had finished therapy.

So far only few studies focusing to greylisting efficiency were published. Greylisting implementation in Postgrey has been successfully used in the Author’s university SMTP server since 2006. There were some attempts to evaluate its efficiency based on logs but due to many other aspects of SPAM elimination playing the role the direct efficiency comparison between various periods is difficult. Therefore also other SMTP servers at cooperating bodies were examined to obtain proper information about its efficiency. Two SMTP server using Postgrey with Postfix and one SMTP server using greylisting in different implementation were studied; the efficiency was estimated and mutually compared. The main result of the study is that significant efficiency decrease was not observed despite greylisting simplicity. This study extends previous findings regarding efficiency to longer period and what is especially significant, confirms results by comparing results to other sites. Also another finding demonstrating the input Postfix filtering as an efficient anti-SPAM measurement is illustrated. The main conclusion is that filtering SPAM as soon as possible, i. e. before <b>real</b> <b>delivery</b> of SPAM messages to target SMTP server, is extremely efficient anti-SPAM measure comparing other methods...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} assessing a trainee’s performance during a simulated delivery training by employing automatic analysis of a video camera signal. We aim at providing objective statistics reflecting the trainee’s behavior, so that the instructor is able to give valuable suggestions after the training. The basic idea is to analyze the moving and location parameters of the trainee, on which {{the behavior of the}} trainee can be judged and also compared. Our system consists of three major steps. In the first step, we label specific pixels with a given color, based on a Gaussian model. In the second step, the mean shift (MS) algorithm is employed to find the densest region of a color, where the center of that region indicates the center of a medical cap worn by a trainee. To accelerate the convergence of the MS algorithm, we propose to combine the distribution sampling and on-line mode updating based on the pyramid sampling technique. In the last step, we assume that the cap’s position represents the position of a trainee. Therefore, several statistics, such as the moving trajectory and the total movement of each trainee, can be calculated. These statistics associated with the domain knowledge, help us to determine trainees’ teamwork. Our system also enables an interactive way for instructors to choose the interested individual trainee, and then provides more results of him.

For this case, accurate information on number of hops to destination may not be avail-able. A technique to estimate this distance metric is presented.

40|$|Background: Delivery {{scheduling}} plays {{a significant}} role in business activities of enterprises which operate on EU market, especially the ones which deal with production and trade of alcohol products. The character of such activities requires to take into consideration various regulations which determine many guidelines and constraints in storing and transporting of such products between EU countries. On the other hand, these issues are not well recognized in the literature. 	 Methods:  Authors proposed a heuristic algorithm for solving the problem of scheduling this type of deliveries. Basing on the constraints and input data, which includes demand for deliveries in wider planning horizon, the algorithm creates a daily delivery schedule from one or many suppliers to one consignee. The algorithm takes into consideration the consignee&# 39;s, suppliers&# 39; and carrier&# 39;s interests. This is done by including their constraints as well as by including three criteria in the scheduling process, i. e. minimization of the stock in transit and minimization of the dispersion of loadings and unloadings in consignee&# 39;s and each supplier&# 39;s warehouses. 	Results: The proposed algorithm has been implemented in spreadsheet with solver extension. It was applied for solving the <b>real</b> <b>delivery</b> scheduling problem in one of alcohol products importing companies, in which manually filling of DRP matrixes method was previously used. The results show that algorithm works correctly and efficiently in comparison to previously used method. 	Conclusions: The results show, {{that there is a need}} for further research on the field of determination suppliers order in the scheduling process. The possibility of implementation of multiple criteria analysis or optimization methods for solving such problems may be also a good direction of further research. 	 ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Childbirth medical {{training}} of young obstetricians consists in performing <b>real</b> <b>deliveries,</b> under supervisor control. This medical procedure becomes more complicated when instrumented deliveries requiring {{the use of}} forceps or suction cups become necessary. For this reason, the use of childbirth simulation tools can complement the training of obstetricians (generally considered as too short) and could improve the medical procedures. The realization {{of this kind of}} simulators can repose on a virtual part, enabling the visualization of the organs and fetus behavior. Moreover, this virtual part can be coupled to a haptic interface that allows user interaction. In this context, we have developed, in collaboration with obstetricians, a bio-mechanical model of the childbirth. This paper focuses on the geometrical and bio-mechanical models of the mains organs involved (i. e. the parturient’s uterus, abdomen and pelvis interacting with the fetus). This model allows the realistic simulation (based on continuum mechanics and finite element method) of the descent of the fetus through the birth canal during childbirth. Moreover, this simulation was coupled to a haptic interface (the BirthSIM Simulator). The results validate the pertinence of the proposed model to improve the existing training simulators for the childbirth obstetrician gesture.

Most of the applications such as video conferencing, visual telephone etc. need multimedia transmission techniques that send multimedia data from one end to another with enhanced efficiency, robustness and security. Multimedia streaming service requires adequate bandwidth and delay variation to attain excellent quality of service. Congestion happens frequently owing to unpredictable fluctuations and burstiness of traffic flows within high speed networks. Congestion has to be resolved as it is the main cause for packet loss and long delay that affects the Quality of Service in Networks. Various researchers over last decade developed a number of congestion control mechanisms. But Congestion control for streamed media traffic over Internet is still a great challenge.

Shared media can be found in broadcast networks operating in packet mode. One problem in this environment is unsteady bandwidth. On these networks, the total bandwidth which is used depends on the offered load. In case of excess load, the total bandwidth decreases when it should be reaching its maximal value. Therefore, it is difficult to manage the bandwidth since it does not remain at the same level.
