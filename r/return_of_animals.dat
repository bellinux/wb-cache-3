40|$|When we {{read about}} manure in the popular press it is seldom to sing its praises. Both {{producers}} and {{the public at large}} are often unaware of the value of manure to agriculture. The <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals,</b> and the manure they produce, to the prairies has the potential to significantly increase the sustainability of prairie agriculture. For decades the organic matter and nutrient content of prairie soils has been declining as rates of removal under annual cropping and grain export have outpaced the return of organic matter and nutrients to the soil. Animal manure, an excellent source of nutrients and organic matter, provides the opportunity to replenish the soil and increase soil fertility Manure contains all of the major crop nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) as well as many, if not all of the minor nutrients needed by plants. Manure has an additional benefit beyond its nutrient content. Manure contains many organic compounds. These compounds help to build and maintain soil structure which in turn helps to maintain soil tilth, water holding capacity, soil aeration and reduces soil erosion.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to explore the effects of prior exposure to amphetamine on subsequent stress-induced and free feeding of regular chow or palatable cereal. After treatment with 5 injections of either d-amphetamine (3 mg/kg IP) or saline, administered on alternate days, animals in Experiments 1 and 3 were permanently moved to computer-controlled test cages, whereas animals in Experiment 2 remained in the colony room and were transported to the test cages for testing only. After 14 drug-free days, animals were either briefly handled or restrained for 20 min, on 10 consecutive days, 6 hours into the light cycle. Consumption of regular chow or palatable cereal was monitored for 1 hour following the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> to the cages. Amphetamine preexposure enhanced stress-induced consumption of regular chow (Experiment 1) and, to some extent, of palatable cereal (Experiment 2), despite the stress-induced suppression of palatable food intake. Stress-induced feeding of regular chow increased progressively over initial stress sessions, indicating sensitization of the response to stress. Amphetamine preexposure also enhanced free consumption of palatable cereal, which similarly sensitized over repeated tests. The effects of amphetamine preexposure on stress-induced and free intake of palatable food were more pronounced in females than in males. When testing was conducted in home cage environment (Experiment 3), amphetamine preexposure had no effect on palatable food consumption, however, it enhanced regular chow intake during the light cycle. Thus, prior exposure to sensitizing regimen of amphetamine exerts long-lasting effects on subsequent response of animals to motivationally significant stimuli...|$|E

40|$|A queda dos índices reprodutivos é medida pela redução no número de bezerros nascidos que reflete imediatamente na redução da produção de leite e na rentabilidade {{comercial}} da propriedade. A repercussão administrativa é o incremento das despesas de manutenção com vacas secas, maiores taxas de descarte e maior número de doses de sêmen por concepção. Parâmetros relacionados ao nível de higiene do úbere e do sistema de ordenha e os critérios ambientais globais como o controle na pressão de sucção da ordenhadeira, o sistema de ventilação para os animais assim como a higiene na sala de ordenha, contribuem de forma satisfatória para o controle de patógenos transmissíveis entre os animais de produção. Estudo sobre monitoramento de rebanho demonstrou que o tempo do intervalo de partos aumenta significativamente em vacas de primeira lactação com vulvovaginite, mas a ocorrência da lesão não apresentou associação com os casos de descarte voluntário. Pesquisas sobre a probabilidade de introdução de agentes infecciosos em rebanhos livres da doença identificaram que os fatores de risco significativos para esta disseminação estiveram relacionados com a devolução de animais que foram retirados para comercialização, proximidade entre pastos de diferentes propriedades e principalmente pela vestimenta do veterinário ou de visitantes. Ao analisar os fatores de risco para a ocorrência de determinada doença as causas multifatoriais são consideradas. As análises de regressão para identificar fatores de risco normalmente consideram os efeitos multifatoriais e o desfecho. Assim, a identificação do fator de risco consiste em comparar o padrão de distribuição das variáveis dependentes entre os níveis de ocorrência da doença. O M. canadense ainda é pouco conhecido nos processos patológicos da reprodução. O M. bovis é altamente adaptado aos bovinos, porém já foi isolado em amostras de búfalos, pequenos ruminantes e humanos. O M. bovigenitalium foi relacionado com patologias do sistema reprodutivo há mais de três décadas e foi considerado como o agente primário da vulvovaginite. A vulvite granular promovida pelo U. diversum foi demonstrada tanto em animais vacinados quanto nos não vacinados. O agente apresenta fatores de interação celular, a habilidade de se ligar à superfície de membrana do hospedeiro e ainda mecanismos biológicos de escape à resposta imunológica apresentada pelo hospedeiro. Tanto animais jovens quanto adultos são susceptíveis. A transmissão ocorre pela introdução de animais portadores, sêmen contaminado e contato com as secreções genitais de animais infectadosThe {{reduction of}} reproductive rates {{is measured by}} the {{reduction in the number of}} calves born that immediately reflected in the reduction of milk production and profitability of commercial property. The effect is the increased administrative costs of maintenance with dry cows, higher rates of rejection and a higher number of doses of semen for conception. Parameters related to the level of hygiene of the udder and the milking system and environmental criteria as the overall control on the suction pressure of the milking, the ventilation system for livestock and hygiene in the milking parlor, contribute to the satisfaction of the control of pathogens transmissible among livestock. Study on monitoring the herd showed that the time of calving interval increases significantly in the first lactation cows with vaginitis, but the injury was not associated with cases of voluntary discharge. Research on the likelihood of introduction of infectious agents into herds free of the disease found that the significant risk factors for this spread were related to the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> that were removed for marketing, proximity between pastures of different properties and especially the clothing of a veterinarian or visitors. When analyzing the risk factors for the occurrence of a disease the causative factors are considered. Regression analysis to identify risk factors usually consider the multifactorial effects and outcome. The identification of the risk factor is to compare the pattern of distribution of the dependent variables between the levels of occurrence of the disease. Infections with mycoplasma (Mollicutes) in farm animals, have historical importance and continuing today interfering with livestock productivity. The M. Canadense is still little known in the pathological processes of reproduction. The M. bovis is highly adapted to cattle, however has been isolated in samples of buffalo, small ruminants and humans. The M. bovigenitalium was related to diseases of the reproductive system for more than three decades and was considered as the primary agent of vaginitis. The granular vulvitis sponsored by the U. diversum was demonstrated both in animals vaccinated as in unvaccinated. The agent has to interact with cellular factors, the ability to bind to the surface membrane of the host and even biological mechanisms to escape immune response submitted by host.

The oxidizable carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur status of the soils was determined, and yield and composition of ryegrass grown in the sampled soils was also investigated. Greenhouse studies with ryegrass as a bioassay revealed that the previous superphosphate fertilizer history as well as period of grazing and stocking intensity increased yield. Moreover, plant nutrient composition of the bioassay ryegrass tended to reflect residual effects from superphosphate fertilizer and the <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> droppings on the surface 10 cm of soils.

40|$|Grassland/livestock systems {{differ in}} their wherewithal to enhance the {{magnitude}} of GHG fluxes (CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O) and their global warming potential (GWP). A simulation study was performed using the model PASIM to extrapolate potential emissions from grassland/livestock systems under alternative climate/soil/plant/management regimes at 12 French sites. Fluxes of CO 2 associated with those of N 2 O indicate that both gases may be controlled by similar or concomitant environmental factors. In particular, CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes {{were higher in the}} temporary grasslands, where grass management (mowing, N fertilization) promotes increased plant respiration and soil organic matter turnover. In these systems, high CO 2 and N 2 O emissions were accompanied by absence of CH 4 emissions. Similar responses were observed with intensive permanent grasslands, where the presence <b>of</b> grazing <b>animals</b> also determines CH 4 emissions. High CH 4, and low CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes were generally estimated with extensive permanent pastures. While there are site-to-site and climate-to-climate variations, a general conclusion is that the GWP is expected to decrease in the future as result of increased soil dryness and C stocking. Also, temporary grasslands are indicated as the most desirable land use in reducing global warming.

40|$|Most {{field trials}} {{conducted}} in New Zealand for assessing pasture plant sulphur (S) requirements use the mowing and clipping return technique without the inclusion <b>of</b> grazing <b>animals.</b> A rotational grazing experiment and a field plot trial {{were conducted on}} a Templeton silt loam soil (Udic Ustochrept) in Canterbury using radioactive ³⁵S-labelled fertilisers {{to examine the effects}} of grazed sheep on the plant availability and cycling of applied S fertilisers. An additional plot trial was conducted to determine leaching losses of ³⁵S-labelled urine applied to pastures. The results obtained showed that maximum ³⁵S concentration in pastures treated with elemental S occurred 3 months earlier in the grazed trials compared with that of ungrazed plots. This increased herbage S was also reflected in the wool ³⁵S of ewes which grazed the pastures. In addition, the amount of residual elemental S remaining in the soil after 3 months of its application was significantly lower in grazed than in ungrazed pastures. These results suggest that grazing animals enhanced the plant availability of elemental S probably because of the effects <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> trampling and the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> faeces. It was also found that about 36 - 44 % of the applied ³⁵S fertilisers and up to 68 % of the applied urinary ³⁵ 5 were not recovered in the soil within one growing season in the field. Thus grazing animals enhanced not only the availability of elemental S, but were also responsible for substantial losses of S from pastures through animal excreta. The present data suggest that field trial results obtained from mowing plot trials without the inclusion <b>of</b> grazing <b>animals</b> are unlikely to assess adequately the plant availability of elemental S...|$|R

40|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> draft {{power for}} soil tillage {{has long been}} a major theme of {{agricultural}} development programmes in semi-arid West Africa. The rationale for animal traction utilization ranges from increasing agricultural productivity and income to relieving the drudgery in farm work. Yet, its adoption remains low and localized. Previous research has identified the conditions which favour the adoption <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> traction, but evidence on the potential benefits realizable from its use is mixed. The issue of how to improve the adoption and profitable utilization <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> traction in semi-arid West Africa remains an important topic given that mechanization of agriculture is inevitable. This paper uses data collected from villages in two different agroclimatic zones of Niger to demonstrate the regional variability of potential gains from animal traction. Production functions were estimated to determine the impact <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> traction use on area cultivated, labour input and aggregate yield. Multi-year partial budget streams were also estimated to evaluate the profitability <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> traction at each location. The results show that the use <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> traction did not have any significant impact on area cultivated, but increased the yields of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and maize (Zea mays L.) by 12 - 15 %. It increased labour input by 15 man-h ha- 1 (man hours per hectare) in the dry agroclimatic zone, but reduced it by 50 man-h ha- 1 in the wet zone. Rates <b>of</b> <b>return</b> on <b>animal</b> traction investment ranged from - 4 to 18 % in the dry zone and from 14 to 58 % in the wet zone. These results suggest that the impact <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> traction on agricultural production varies by region and depends on a broad set of agroecological and economic conditions. The absence of these conditions in marginal areas strictly limits potential utilization and profitability. On efficiency grounds, it is recommended that animal traction should be promoted only in areas where the climate, soil and economic conditions permit its intensive and profitable utilization...|$|R
