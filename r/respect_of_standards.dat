40|$|Nowadays, {{companies}} {{need to develop}} sustainable solutions to be competitive and to respect international standards. It means producing products compliant to target costs, impacts and risks, as well as exploiting sustainable processes. This is particularly challenging for those processes requiring a large consumption of energy, which have high environmental and economic impacts. In this paper the industrial process of plastic material extrusion is considered and analysed. Indeed, it is a highly energy-consuming process that requires monitoring the energy consumption and controlling the process parameters to increase the sustainability and assure the <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> <b>standards.</b> The research is based on lifecycle design (LCD) and sustainable manufacturing principles. The proposed method aims at improving the extrusion process sustainability by identifying the more energy-consuming phases and evaluating the impact of manufacturing process items on the achievement of target values. The industrial case study demonstrates how such a method supports sustainability optimisation and compliance to standards...|$|E

The first {{system is in}} coherence with OF principles (1 lambing per ewe per year) whereas the second one tries {{to be much more}} productive and is much more confronted to the <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> <b>standards.</b> The aim is to study the global balance with a systemic approach, the technical (animal) and economic performances, the ways to have a good mastery of sanitary problem with as few chemical treatments as possible, the quality of the lambs, the management of the forage system and the soil fertility, the biodiversity. A specific work is made about the reproduction of ewes (how to have good fertility for spring mating) and the limitation of concentrates for the lambs. The economic performances are compared with private organic and conventional farms. Two 100 ewes flocks are compared, each managed with their own lands (pastures, crops…: 24 ha by system) and shed. Recorded data are concerning grass production, animals (fertiliy, prolificacy, mortality, growing rates, body scores, concentrate use, faecal analysis for worms), economics (production costs, products, calculation of gross margin), quality of carcass (conformation, color and firmness of subcutaneous fat), biodiversity (flora, insects, birds). The economical advantage of increasing lambing frequency was not demonstrated, whereas this strategy complexified management and resulted in higher internal parasitic infection of the lambs, and finally showed a lower stability.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{representations}} and practices evolution of two CoPs’ {{members of the}} domain of education who used ICT tools and services supporting collaborative edition and documents production. These artefacts related to multimedia authoring, knowledge management and mediation {{are based on the}} <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> allowing data accessibility, reusability and interoperability. They have been developed {{within the framework of the}} European project PALETTE through a participatory design process in which these CoPs were involved. The evolution of the CoPs’ members’ representations and practices was observed through answers to a questionnaire (before and after the activities), the individual logbooks weekly handled by the participants, interviews and their productions. First, we observed that the use of several tools or services allows the members to become more competent in the domain of the ICT in terms of practices and technological literacy. They discover more transverse functions through the tools and feel more comfortable when using new interfaces. This also decreases fears of certain members who had negative representations regarding ICT. Then, the scenarios concretely offered to the CoPs’ members to live collaborative activities supported by ICT artefacts. They could exchange ideas, resources and knowledge. These experiments enabled them to refine their representations about collaborative learning and to get reference tools to support their future activities. They declared the use of these artefacts allowed the emergence of a CoP but also the development of the feeling of belonging to a CoP. The tasks realization during the trials created some common interests between the members. For many of them it was their first experiment in collaborative edition. They learned favourable modes and codes to produce and exchange when carrying on this kind of task. They also perceived the importance of the role of a CoP animator. As for the production of documents, the discovery of several new tools allowed the CoPs’ members to compare them with different editors and examine their advantages and disadvantages. Even if the tools were not still or sufficiently accepted and adopted by the members, this comparison allowed a certain awareness of the importance of standards, exchangeable documents and durability of data.

40|$|In {{the period}} 1965 - 1974, the Institut Bordet treated 35 {{patients}} suffering from osteogenic sarcoma. Radiotherapy {{was used in}} 23 cases: these treatments invariably consisted of high level radiation. An analysis {{of the results of}} these 23 treatments confirms the conclusion drawn from a study of the results of patients treated by 200 kV X-rays up to 1964. If a tumour irradiated at a dosage of 6000 - 7000 rads is left in situ for 3 - 6 months, the chances of survival of patients are not compromised. Radiotherapy can, only in exceptional cases, definitively eliminate such tumours. Moreover, it appears that in <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> therapy no significant progress in local treatment has resulted from the use of higher dosages, within the limits of tolerance of healthy tissues to ionising radiation even at high levels. The optimism generated by various recent articles that such progress could result from the use of unusual fractionation, radiosensitivity inducing agents or associated treatments, is discussed in the light of this limited experience. The importance of perfecting efficacious adjuvant treatment for the irradiation of micrometastases, in particular those of the lung, is equally stressed.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of power efficient vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) in the 1. 55 µm range, with relatively high output power (> 1 mW) and enhanced thermal dissipation is still challenging, but {{would represent a}} real breakthrough for the scientific community, with important perspectives in different areas of fundamental research and applied physics (WDM and FTTH networks, gas sensing and deformation detectors, microwaves, etc.). In this context, a novel bonding technique is presented in this work. It relies {{on the use of}} a BCB polymer bonding to virtually report any material on a Si host platform, through the use of Cu-filled vias acting as µ-heat sinks. This so-called Through Silicon Holes Electroplated Copper (TSHEC) technique has undoubtedly several advantages, since it allows a hybrid integration of III-V active regions on a Si substrate (for photonics, microelectronics, microfluidics integration), it avoids stress-induced limitation with <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> large Cu surface solutions, and it is cost-effective. Moreover, it is fully compatible with optical pumping as well as electrical injection schemes. This approach has been recently validated in the case of InP-based OP-VCSEL structures, for which an emission power exceeding 2 mW with a threshold as low as 7 mW at 20 °C has been demonstrated, {{in the case of a}} bottom hybrid metal-dielectric Bragg mirror (H-DBR) of 20 µm in diameter. Different diameter sizes for the bottom H-DBR have been tested, ranging from 20 µm up to 100 µm.

Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) are the video display components of televisions and computer monitors (EPA, 1995). Arising problem related with recovery and recycling of CRT glass stimulates examinations aimed at making cullet-based ceramic materials of reinforced mechanical strength. Glasses as cone and neck contain principally different lead contents another dangerous elements instead panel glass has other heavy metals (Ba, Sr, etc.) that forbid their recycling in the glass industry {{for the production of}} containers, domestic glassware and glass fiber. As it is well known concrete is an excellent material for immobilization of these metals, what was the reason to undertake this research. The use of CRT (Cathode Ray tube) waste glasses in concrete has attracted a lot of interest worldwide due to the increased disposal costs and environmental concerns. Because of silica large quantities CRT glass in the theory is a pozzolanic in nature, thus it {{can be used as a}} sand replacement in light concrete. The research was performed with use of concrete mortars. As a reference concrete mortar a mix of cement, sand, expanded clay aggregate and water was used. The purpose of this work was to investigate the influence of additives e. g. CRT glass cullet as an aggregate, and fluidized fly ash on concrete properties. Based on obtained results both CRT glass cullet and fluidize fly ash improved compressive and flexural strength in <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> concrete mortar without these additives.
