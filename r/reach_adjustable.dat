40|$|Abstract—In Future Internet it is {{possible}} to change elements of congestion control in order to eliminate jitter and batch loss caused by the current control mechanisms based on packet loss events. We investigate the fundamental problem of adjusting sending rates to achieve optimal utilization of highly variable bandwidth of a network path using accurate packet rate infor-mation. This is done by continuously controlling the sending rate with a function of the measured packet rate at the receiver. We propose the relative loss of packet rate between the sender and the receiver (Relative Rate Reduction, RRR) as a new accurate and continuous measure of congestion of a network path, replacing the erratically fluctuating packet loss. We demonstrate that with choosing various RRR based feedback functions the optimum is <b>reached</b> with <b>adjustable</b> congestion level. The proposed method guarantees fair bandwidth sharing of competitive flows. Finally we present testbed experiments to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm. I...|$|R
50|$|The 2008 Fiesta {{includes}} Ford's Convers+ menu system, as {{seen on the}} Mondeo, S-MAX and Galaxy, and {{complemented by}} steering wheel button controls. Ford initially anticipated that over 85% of Fiesta orders would include this multifunction display. Other new equipment includes keyless entry with a 'Ford Power' starter button, <b>reach</b> and rake <b>adjustable</b> steering wheel, electric power steering, and a USB port for portable music players. Ford Easyfuel, the capless refuelling system recently introduced with the Ford Mondeo, {{will also be a}} feature, while 'ambient lighting,' casting a soft red glow over the interior, will be an option. For the 2011 US market model, the Ford Sync in-car communications and entertainment system will be available as an option.|$|R
5000|$|Steering is by worm and wheel. The {{steering}} box is {{fixed to the}} cylinder head and a long drop arm provides good leverage. The clutch uses a single plate and runs in oil.The 4-speed gearbox is a strengthened version of the 14/45 gearbox. It is assembled as a unit with the engine. It is operated by a right-hand change speed lever with <b>reach</b> <b>adjustable</b> for the driver. Gearbox lubrication is from the engine and automatic. Final drive is by spiral bevel ...|$|E

40|$|The Allis-Chalmers {{betatron}} is a high-energy induc­tion {{electron accelerator}} commercially made for taking industrial X-ray photographs. In this application, the electrons emitted from a hot filament are accelerated dur­ing the first quarter-cycle of an alternating magnetic field, which is excited by a 180 cps sine wave source. During the acceleration, the electrons are constrained to a stable orbit of constant radius {{by having the}} field of special shape. When the electrons have reached the desired energy, the orbit is expanded and the electrons strike a thin, heavy-element target. The rapid decelera­tion causes the electrons to lose their energy principally {{in the form of}} gamma rays (X-rays). The energy spectrum of these rays is continuous and ranges up to the kinetic energy of the electrons when they strike the target. In nuclear physics work, the maximum energy of the X-ray spectrum must be accurately known and continuously variable. This means that the orbit must be expanded at the time in the cycle when the electrons have the required energy. This present work is concerned with the electronic circuitry which has been developed to cause the orbit to expand when the instantaneous electron energy <b>reaches</b> some <b>adjustable</b> preset value...|$|R
