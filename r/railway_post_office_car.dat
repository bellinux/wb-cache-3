50|$|The Metropolitan Special was the {{workhorse}} {{passenger train}} of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) during the 1920s - 1960s between St. Louis, Missouri, and Jersey City, New Jersey, where at Communipaw Terminal passengers transferred to buses and ferries to Manhattan in New York City. Major station stops included Washington, D.C., and Cincinnati, Ohio. The Metropolitan Special carried {{vast amounts of}} mail and express packages in many (often 10+) baggage cars and express cars, and the train served various smaller towns and villages that were bypassed by the more prestigious trains along the route, the National Limited and the Diplomat. Added revenue for the train came from <b>Railway</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>cars,</b> which sorted and canceled mail en route, between terminals.|$|R
25|$|The {{principal}} mainline railroads concentrated {{their efforts}} on moving freight and passengers over long distances. But many had suburban services near large cities, which might also be served by Streetcar and Interurban lines. The Interurban was an almost uniquely North American concept which relied almost exclusively on passenger traffic for revenue. Unable to survive the Great Depression, the failure of most Interurbans by that time left many cities without suburban passenger railroads, although the largest cities such as New York, Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia continued to have suburban service. The major railroads passenger flagship services included multi-day journeys on luxury trains resembling hotels, which were unable to compete with airlines in the 1950s. Rural communities were served by slow trains no more than twice a day. They survived until the 1960s because the same train hauled the <b>Railway</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>cars,</b> {{paid for by the}} US <b>Post</b> <b>Office.</b> RPOs were withdrawn when mail sorting was mechanized.|$|R

50|$|The {{eastbound}} Manhattan Limited {{received the}} Pittsburghers sleepers after the latters demise on September 13, 1964. The Manhattan Limited lost sleeper service west of Pittsburgh {{in both directions}} on March 3, 1968. The Manhattan Limited was retained after the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the New York Central Railroad into the ill-fated Penn Central, but in 1970 the Penn Central petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to abandon the train. By then the Manhattan Limiteds consist was down to two coaches and a snack bar. At Pittsburgh a single waiting sleeping car {{and one of the}} last operating <b>Railway</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>cars</b> from the sidetracks of the adjacent U.S. <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> were switched into the eastbound consist behind the locomotive for the overnight leg to New York City. The train was also available to transport specialty cars of traveling performance shows such as Holiday on Ice. The ICC granted the Penn Centrals discontinuation request, but the passage of the Rail Passenger Service Act kept the Manhattan Limited running while Amtrak formed. Amtrak did not retain the Manhattan Limited, choosing the Broadway Limited instead. The Manhattan Limited made its final run on April 30, 1971.|$|R
5000|$|From the 1880s {{until well}} into the 1950s, {{virtually}} all long-distance transportation of United States Mail was performed by the railroads. Specially equipped <b>Railway</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> (RPO) <b>cars</b> were a part of most passenger trains, the cars staffed by highly trained railway postal clerks who sorted mail as the train sped along its route. The growth of this mail distribution network paralleled the expansion of the railroads, allowing mail to be exchanged between routes at junction points where two railroads crossed or shared passenger terminals.|$|R
2500|$|After 1948, the <b>railway</b> <b>post</b> <b>office</b> network {{began its}} decline {{although}} it remained the principal intercity mail transportation and distribution function within the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> Department (POD). There were 794 RPO lines operating over 161,000 miles of railroad in that year. [...] Only 262 RPO routes were still operating by January 1, 1962. [...] In 1942, the POD began {{experimenting with a}} highway version of the RPO to serve the same purposes along routes where passenger train service was not available. [...] These highway <b>post</b> <b>office</b> (HPO) vehicles were initially intended to supplement RPO service, but in the 1950s and 1960s, HPOs often replaced <b>railway</b> <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>cars</b> after passenger train service was discontinued. The last interurban RPO service was operated by Pacific Electric Railway on its route between Los Angeles and San Bernardino, California. When the <b>post</b> <b>office</b> made a controversial policy change to process mail in large regional [...] "sectional centers," [...] mail was now sorted by large machines, not by people, and the remaining <b>railway</b> <b>post</b> <b>office</b> routes, along with all highway <b>post</b> <b>office</b> routes, were phased out of service. In September 1967 the POD cancelled all [...] "mail by rail" [...] contracts, electing to move all First Class mail via air and other classes by road (truck) transport. This announcement had a devastating effect on passenger train revenues; the Santa Fe, for example, lost $35 million (US) in annual business, and led directly to the ending of many passenger rail routes.|$|R

5000|$|Operating {{westbound}} as Train # 9, the Chicago Express, and eastbound as Train # 10, the Washington Express, {{it was an}} [...] "accommodation" [...] train, {{meaning that}} it made stops at most stations along the route bypassed by B&O's other trains, resulting in a slower timecard than the more prestigious Capitol Limited. The Washington-Chicago Express required a leisurely 18½ hours for its 767 mi journey, compared to the faster Capitol Limiteds 16-hour pace. The Washington-Chicago Express was also B&O's primary train for mail and Railway Express Agency shipments, having heavy head end equipment consisting of several <b>Railway</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> (RPO) <b>cars,</b> baggage cars, and bulk mail boxcars.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Railway</b> <b>post</b> <b>office</b> was {{introduced}} in the United States on July 28, 1862, using converted baggage cars on the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad (which also delivered the first letter to the Pony Express).

Due to a decline in overall ridership, and Southern Railway's determination to escape the expensive burden of operating Memphis Union Station, the Tennessean was discontinued on March 30, 1968. This discontinuance ended all Southern Railway passenger train service to Memphis, allowing abandonment of Memphis Union Station.|$|E
2500|$|In 1938 {{industrial}} designer Henry Dreyfuss {{was commissioned by}} the New York Central to design streamlined train sets in Art Deco style, with the locomotive and passenger cars rendered in blues and grays (the colors of NYC).

Like many express passenger trains through the mid-1960s, the 20th Century Limited carried an East Division (E.D.) <b>Railway</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> (R.P.O.) <b>car</b> operated by the Railway Mail Service (RMS) of the United States <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> Department which was staffed by USPOD clerks as a [...] "fast mail" [...] on each of its daily runs.

50|$|The Lackawanna rebuilt a {{total of}} 18 combine cars for {{multiple}} unit operation: fifteen baggage/express and three <b>railway</b> <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> (RPO). These <b>cars</b> were drawn from different batches. Combines 426-428 were built in 1917; 429-433 in 1921; 434-443 in 1925. Cars 426 and 442-423 were the RPOs. All save 426 were converted to MU trailers in 1930; 426 was converted later. The baggage express cars were renumbered 2400-2414; the RPOs 2440-2442. The RPOs were used on the Gladstone Branch and Dover Branch; at 22 mi, the Gladstone RPO made the shortest such run in the United States. In 1961 the combines were renumbered 3400-3415 and 3440-3441.|$|R
2500|$|Much of the Chippewas {{equipment}} came second-hand {{from its}} more famous cousin. The original Chippewa operated with two coaches, a <b>railway</b> <b>post</b> <b>office</b> (RPO), dining <b>car,</b> and parlor car. As {{part of a}} reshuffling of equipment on the Milwaukee Road in late 1948 the Chippewa received the [...] "Beaver Tail" [...] parlors made famous by the original Hiawatha. Motive power was provided by Class A 4-4-2 steam locomotives between Chicago and Milwaukee, and by the Class F3 Pacifics north. Dieselization came in 1950 with Erie-builts from Fairbanks-Morse. Later diesels included EMD E7s, EMD FP7s, and finally EMD GP9s. The train received newer equipment in 1948, including third-generation Beaver Tail parlors. These cars were removed in 1951 along with the full dining car.|$|R
