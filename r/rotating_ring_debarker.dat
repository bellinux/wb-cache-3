40|$|Load-balanced routing in SONET rings has {{attracted}} much attention recently. Most prior works modeled the SONET rings as undirected rings and the traffic as undirected chords. While this model fits well to the traditional telephony applications, it is inefficient for the explosive Internet traffic and multimedia data communications, which exhibit an unidirectional and asymmetric nature. For these applications, it is proper to model the SONET rings {{as a pair of}} counter <b>rotated</b> <b>rings</b> and the traffic as directed chords. In this paper, we first explore general flow properties in counter <b>rotated</b> <b>rings</b> and then introduce flow rounding and unsplitting techniques.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of cold bosons in a periodic one-dimensional <b>rotating</b> <b>ring</b> lattice is {{treated in a}} representation constructed in terms of ¯rst band Bloch functions.

Extension to <b>rotating</b> <b>ring</b> lattices is straightforward. Bose-Einstein conden-sation phenomena associated with the Mott transition under lattice rotation and the corresponding condensate wavefunctions are obtained in a many-body framework. The use of correct lattice single particle energies is found to cure an inconsistency which oc-curs in the usual Bose-Hubbard model ground state inertial parameters used to de¯ne super°uid fractions in the phenomenological two-°uid picture. ...|$|R

It is about 50,000 light-years across and about 42 million light-years away from Earth. It is receding from Earth at 883 kilometers per second. It is an object of great scientific interest, because polar-ring galaxies are very rare galaxies. They are thought to form when two galaxies gravitationally interact with each other.

40|$|Most {{previous}} theoretical {{treatments of}} the <b>rotating</b> <b>ring</b> disk electrode have assumed equal diffusivities {{among the various}} components diffusing to or from the electrode. A thorough investigation {{of the effects of}} unequal diffusion coeffi-cients among the different components has not been available in the past. In this work, the unequal diffusivities among reactants are taken into account. The partial differential equations describing the mass transfer with chemical reaction at the <b>rotating</b> <b>ring</b> disk electrode taking into account the inequal ity in diffusion coefficients among the different com-ponents are solved by orthogonal collocation. The spatial d imensions are discretized leaving a continuous dependence on time. Exponential ly weighted polynomials are used in the direction normal to the electrode while the "shifted " Jacobi polynomials are used in the radial direction for discretization of the spatial dimensions. It is shown here that the choice of trial functions in the normal direction is crucial in obtaining accurate solutions when the diffusivities of the different com-ponents are unequal. The values of the diffusivity ratios of the different components are varied systematical ly over a wide range to examine their effect on the ring current. The results are compared with the case when the diffusivities are as-sumed to be equal.
