50|$|There {{are three}} basic {{definitions}} for integral linearity in common use: independent linearity, zero-based linearity, and terminal, or end-point, linearity. In each case, linearity defines {{how well the}} device's actual performance across a specified operating range approximates a straight line. Linearity is usually {{measured in terms of}} a deviation, or non-linearity, from an ideal straight line and it is typically expressed in terms of percent of full scale, or in ppm (parts per million) of full scale. Typically, the straight line is obtained by performing a least-squares fit of the data. The three definitions vary {{in the manner in which}} the straight line is positioned relative to the actual device's performance. Also, all three of these definitions ignore any gain, or offset errors that may be present in the actual device's performance characteristics.Many times a device's specifications will simply refer to linearity, with no other explanation as to which type of linearity is intended. In cases where a specification is expressed simply as linearity, it is assumed to imply independent linearity.Independent linearity is probably the most commonly used linearity definition and is often found in the specifications for DMMs and ADCs, as well as devices like potentiometers. Independent linearity is defined as the maximum deviation of actual performance relative to a straight line, located such that it minimizes the maximum deviation. In that case there are no constraints placed upon the positioning of the straight line and it may be wherever necessary to minimize the deviations between it and the device's actual performance characteristic.Zero-based linearity forces the lower <b>range</b> <b>value</b> of the straight line to be equal to the actual lower <b>range</b> <b>value</b> of the device's characteristic, but it does allow the line to be rotated to minimize the maximum deviation. In this case, since the positioning of the straight line is constrained by the requirement that the lower range values of the line and the device's characteristic be coincident, the non-linearity based on this definition will generally be larger than for independent linearity.For terminal linearity, there is no flexibility allowed in the placement of the straight line in order to minimize the deviations. The straight line must be located such that each of its end-points coincides with the device's actual upper and lower range values. This means that the non-linearity measured by this definition will typically be larger than that measured by the independent, or the zero-based linearity definitions. This definition of linearity is often associated with ADCs, DACs and various sensors.A fourth linearity definition, absolute linearity, is sometimes also encountered. Absolute linearity is a variation of terminal linearity, in that it allows no flexibility in the placement of the straight line, however in this case the gain and offset errors of the actual device are included in the linearity measurement, making this the most difficult measure of a device's performance. For absolute linearity the end points of the straight line are defined by the ideal upper and lower range values for the device, rather than the actual values. The linearity error in this instance is the maximum deviation of the actual device's performance from ideal.|$|E

The <b>range</b> <b>values</b> obtained in five metals (Be, Al, Cu Ag and Au) and in four dielectrics (glass, mica, sulphur and polystyrene) by direct current collection method and in A 1, Ag and mica by an ionisation method, show that the latter method yields larger <b>range</b> <b>values.</b> A comparison with other results showed that the <b>range</b> <b>values</b> obtained with the Geiger counter are also greater than those obtained by the current collection method, The ionisation-in-depth results in Al showed good agreement with the other results, and with Spencer's theory for equivalent source geometry.

Electron bombardment conductivity has been studied primarily in sulphur and in selenium for comparison.

The single crystals of sulphur showed as much bombardment conductivity as selenium, but much greater conductivity than the polycrystalline specimen, as was noted by Joffe (1928) and as would be expected for a more perfect crystal lattice.
