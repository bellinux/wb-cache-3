40|$|Relative age, talent {{identification}} and youth skill development: Do <b>relatively</b> <b>younger</b> athletes have superior technical skills? Jörg Schorer 1, 2,*, Joe Baker 3, Dirk Büsch 2, 4, Andreas Wilhelm 2, 5 and Jan Pabst 2, 4 Abstract: Relative age effects (RAEs) refer to differences among individuals in age-based cohorts typically used in sport. These effects usually favour relatively older {{members of the}} cohort and are thought to result from differences in maturation and experience among athletes of different chronological age. Recently, researchers suggested that <b>relatively</b> <b>younger</b> participants {{may not be as}} disadvantaged as previously thought. In two studies, we examined whether <b>relatively</b> <b>younger</b> athletes who were able to survive in a system that advantages their relatively older counterparts would develop superior technical skills. In study one, participants aged 13 - 15 years (n= 140) drawn from a regional handball talent selection camp in Germany demonstrated a general relative age effect but no differences between relatively older and <b>relatively</b> <b>younger</b> athletes in physical body size (i. e., height/weight) or technical skills. In study two, similar tests were considered with a large...|$|R

Arsenal fielded a <b>relatively</b> <b>young</b> team throughout the competition; their wins against fellow league opponents Liverpool in the fifth-round and Tottenham Hotspur in the semis were acclaimed by the British press. Chelsea entered the match as favourites and were undefeated against Arsenal in all competitions since 2004.|$|E

5|$|The {{rings of}} Uranus {{are thought to}} be <b>relatively</b> <b>young,</b> and not more than 600million years old.

40|$|Extant {{research}} on school entry and compulsory schooling laws finds that these policies increase {{the high school}} graduation rate of <b>relatively</b> <b>younger</b> students, but weaken their academic performance in early grades. In this paper, we explore the evolution of postsecondary impacts of the interaction of school entry and compulsory schooling laws in Michigan. We employ a regression-discontinuity (RD) design using longitudinal administrative data to examine effects on high school performance, college enrollment, choice, and persistence. On average, we find that children eligible to start school at a <b>relatively</b> <b>younger</b> age {{are more likely to}} complete high school, but underperform while enrolled, compared to their counterparts eligible to start school at a relatively older age. In turn, these students are 2 percentage points more likely to first attend a two-year college, and enroll in fewer postsecondary semesters, relative to their older counterparts. We explore heterogeneity in these effects across subgroups of students defined by gender and poverty status. For example, we illustrate that the increase in the high school graduation rate of <b>relatively</b> <b>younger</b> students attributable to the combination of school entry and compulsory schooling laws is driven entirely by impacts on economically disadvantaged students...|$|R

He also continued to seek private work and contributed to a report on the suitability of the Buller region for settlement and this was published in early 1873. On his retirement in 1869 he had retained his offices of sheriff, returning officer and registration officer but was relieved of these in 1872 in cost-cutting measures by the Nelson Provincial Council. This did not meet with the approval of locals.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the role of a {{relative}} age effect (RAE) and to investigate the influence of biological maturity status on the RAE at the 7 th International Children`s Winter Games. The birth dates of all 572 participants (365 males, 207 females) were analysed, and the biological maturity status of 384 athletes (243 males, 141 females) was assessed by the age at peak height velocity (APHV) method. A RAE was present in the total sample (χ 2 = 67. 81; p < 0. 001), and among both male (χ 2 = 49. 02; p < 0. 001) and female athletes (χ 2 = 37. 00; p < 0. 001) as well as for strength- (χ 2 = 56. 46; p < 0. 001), endurance- (χ 2 = 20. 48; p = 0. 039) and technique-related types of sports (χ 2 = 20. 48; p = 0. 041). No significant differences in biological maturity status were present between the male athletes of single relative age quarters. Among the female athletes a significant difference was present (F = 5. 94, p < 0. 001); <b>relatively</b> <b>younger</b> female athletes had significantly lower values in the APHV, which indicated that they were maturing earlier. However, when dividing the athletes into normal, early and late maturing athletes, it could be seen that among the <b>relatively</b> <b>younger</b> athletes, hardly any late maturing athletes were present. These findings revealed that <b>relatively</b> <b>younger</b> athletes seemed to only have a chance for selection if they were early maturing, whereas relatively older athletes had an increased likelihood for selection independent of their biological maturity status. In the future, the relative age and the biological maturity status should be considered in the talent development system for various types of winter sport, to contribute to more fairness and to not discriminate against <b>relatively</b> <b>younger</b> and less mature athletes...|$|R

30|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the relative age effect on the lengths of professional careers among male Japanese professional baseball players. The results revealed {{that the number of}} players with professional careers of more than 19  years was markedly smaller in Q 4 than in Q 1, Q 2, and Q 3. In addition, relative age was found to be a very important factor for the development of expertise among Japanese male baseball players and may involve long-term disadvantages after becoming professional players. In other words, even if <b>relatively</b> <b>younger</b> players became professional players, their talent may not be sufficient to continue for a long career such as more than 19  years, or they {{may be more likely to}} drop out of a professional career. This result was in contrast to previous findings showing the absence of a relative age effect in the NBA and NFL, and the favoring of <b>relatively</b> <b>younger</b> players in the NHL [27].|$|R

30|$|The {{present study}} focused on how long the {{relative}} age effect continues into adulthood because most {{studies have focused on}} junior players, while, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, only a few studies have examined this topic. We previously reported that the relative age effect persisted among players older than 22  years of age when, theoretically, no physical advantage is expected for older players [26]. The relative age effect has been demonstrated in professional athletes who graduated university (college) at 22  years old; however, this relationship was weaker than that among those who graduated high school at 18  years old. Steingröver and colleagues [27] recently investigated whether relative age influenced career lengths in the National Basketball Association (NBA), National Hockey League (NHL), and National Football League (NFL). They showed that the number of matches played was significantly larger in <b>relatively</b> <b>younger</b> players than in relatively older players in the NHL. No significant differences were observed in career lengths in the NBA or NFL between <b>relatively</b> <b>younger</b> and older players.|$|R
