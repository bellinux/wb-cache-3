50|$|All {{services}} were suspended on 10 January 2011 due to severe weather {{prior to the}} 2011 Brisbane floods. While the CityCat and ferry fleet escaped damage by mooring downstream at the Rivergate Marina or Manly harbour, much of the infrastructure was damaged or destroyed by the floods, causing services to be cancelled indefinitely. Partial CityCat and CityFerry services recommenced on 14 February 2011, using fifteen repaired wharves. Six of the remaining wharves opened using rescued and <b>repaired</b> <b>pontoons</b> on 18 April 2011.|$|R
25|$|From Samoa, Phaon {{moved to}} Funafuti in the Ellice Islands, {{arriving}} there {{shortly after the}} occupation of that island on 18 October. There, she <b>repaired</b> LCTs, <b>pontoon</b> barges, and PT boats. She restored many craft used in the invasion of Tarawa, Gilbert Islands.|$|R
50|$|The {{defenders}} of the bridge-head joined in the retreat across the pontoon bridge. The guns inside Fort Ragusa fired briefly against Fort Napoleon until answered by the captured guns. The action had lasted just 40 minutes. Four grenadiers of the 92nd swam to Fort Ragusa and brought back some boats to <b>repair</b> the <b>pontoon</b> bridge. Soon the rest of Hill's force arrived to find the French abandoning all their works {{on both sides of}} the river. Hill had these works blown up and the bridge burned.|$|R
5000|$|While the Puente Grande {{was being}} {{assessed}} and <b>repaired,</b> a temporary <b>pontoon</b> bridge called Puente de Barcas (Bridge of Boats) was constructed one block below on Calle Rosario. [...] In {{the middle of}} the bridge, the spans were supported by cascos, or large flat-bottomed boats common in the area.|$|R
25|$|Late on {{the evening}} of 21 January, Durnford was ordered to Isandlwana, as was a small {{detachment}} of No. 5 Field Company, Royal Engineers, commanded by Lieutenant John Chard, which had arrived on the 19th to <b>repair</b> the <b>pontoons</b> which bridged the Buffalo. Chard rode ahead of his detachment to Isandlwana on the morning of 22 January to clarify his orders, but was sent back to Rorke's Drift with only his wagon and its driver to construct defensive positions for the expected reinforcement company, passing Durnford's column en route in the opposite direction.|$|R
50|$|From Samoa, Phaon {{moved to}} Funafuti in the Ellice Islands, {{arriving}} there {{shortly after the}} occupation of that island on 18 October. There, she <b>repaired</b> LCTs, <b>pontoon</b> barges, and PT boats. She restored many craft used in the invasion of Tarawa, Gilbert Islands. From Funafuti, Phaon advanced westward to Majuro in the Marshall Islands, arriving 6 February 1944, shortly after the invasion. Here, in the same harbor {{with one of the}} mightiest fleets ever assembled, Phaon worked on minelayers, tankers, minesweepers, destroyers, and small boats (LCVPs and LCMs). On 18 March 1944, Phaon weighed anchor again, proceeded via Kwajalein to Eniwetok in the Marshalls, arriving 23 March for repair work on small boats, LCTs, and yard minesweepers.|$|R
50|$|The pontoon-type VLFS {{platform}} {{rests on}} the water surface and is intended for deployment in calm waters such as a cove, a lagoon or a harbor. Its basic element is a simple box structure; it usually offers high stability, low manufacturing cost and easy maintenance and <b>repair.</b> The <b>pontoon</b> type is supported by its buoyancy on the sea surface. The pontoon type is flexible compared to other kinds of offshore structures, so that the elastic deformations {{are more important than}} their rigid body motions. Thus, hydroelastic analysis is uppermost in designing the pontoon-type VLFS. Together with the motion of the floating structure, the response of the structure to water waves and the impact on the entire fluid domain have to be studied.|$|R
2500|$|On 25 September, Obukhov was {{appointed}} commander of a pontoon boat for the Dnieper crossing. He first reached the river's west bank with 25 soldiers. While still crossing the river, the pontoon came under German fire while 100 {{meters from the}} shore. Bullet holes were causing the pontoon to sink when Obukhov reportedly began patching holes with overcoats and caps. He reportedly ordered the soldiers {{to do the same}} {{and they were able to}} successfully cross [...] the river, keeping the pontoon afloat. During the landing, the infantry officer commanding the soldiers was wounded when German troops opened fire with automatic weapons and Obukhov reportedly replaced him in command. Obukhov organized machine gun fire and was able to neutralize the German positions. Another German machine gun was firing from a bunker, preventing the crossing of more pontoon boats. Obukhov reportedly crawled up to the bunker and destroyed the machine gun, killing its crew with two anti-tank grenades. Obukhov [...] then <b>repaired</b> his <b>pontoon</b> and reportedly managed to cross the Dnieper again, ferrying two antitank guns and 50 soldiers.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, WSDOT {{identified}} {{cracks and}} other problems with the first batch of completed pontoons, estimating that it would cost $400 million to repair cracks and other flaws that would bring down the bridge's predicted lifespan below the desired 75 years. The problems stemmed from shortcuts allegedly taken by contractors to complete pontoons to meet set deadlines; the proposed solutions to fix the pontoons included adding high-tension steel cables and post-tensioning of the concrete. A floating, 660 ST cofferdam was launched in November 2013 to assist in <b>repairs</b> of the <b>pontoons,</b> functioning as a portable drydock that wrapped around parts of the <b>pontoons.</b> The <b>repairs</b> were made by contractors from December 2013 to June 2014 and cost a total of approximately $208 million, using {{up the majority of}} the program's reserve funds. As a result of the pontoon issues, the estimated opening of the bridge was pushed back from December 2014 into 2016.|$|R
