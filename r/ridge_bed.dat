50|$|By 1862, 121 {{families}} {{were in the}} Reems Creek area, many owning more than 1000 acre. Weaverville College, chartered in 1873, attracted many families. The former president's house is now the Dry <b>Ridge</b> <b>Bed</b> and Breakfast. A four-year college, it was downsized in 1912 to junior college status, merging in 1934 with Rutherford and Brevard Colleges to continue in Brevard. In 1912 a public school (grades 1-7) was located at {{the west end of}} Church Street. The first full-time public school on Main Street was established in 1921. In 1927 grades 11-12 attended school in the Robinsom-Lotspeich house (now the Inn on Main Street Bed and Breakfast). Weaverville High School, built by the WPA in 1927, opened on the south end of Main Street, but later merged secondary-school operations with four other area schools (Flat Creek, Red Oak, French Broad, and Barnardsville) in 1954 to form North Buncombe High School. Today, Weaverville is home to two public schools: Weaverville Primary School at 39 S. Main Street, and Weaverville Elementary School at 129 S. Main Street. Both are part of the Buncombe County School system. Weaverville Primary School is home to kindergarten and first grade. Weaverville Elementary School is home to grads 2-4. Weaverville resident children in grades 5-6 attend North Windy Ridge School; those in grades 7-8 attend North Buncombe Middle School; and those in grades 9-12 attend North Buncombe High School, all three of which are north of the town limits.|$|E

In 1998, Taylor became pregnant with Ridge's child; however, she told everyone the baby belonged to Thorne after seeing who she believed to be <b>Ridge</b> in <b>bed</b> with Brooke. In reality, Brooke conned a drunken <b>Ridge</b> into her <b>bed</b> and <b>Ridge</b> rebuked her. Brooke later became interested in Thorne and overcame obstacles with him and his then wife, Macy. Macy was killed in a car accident, which Brooke survived. Thorne and Brooke parted ways, and she turned her attention back to Ridge, who was still married to Taylor. Brooke was later tricked by the Forrester family into traveling to Paris to keep away from the happily married Taylor and Ridge (who had since had twins, Steffy and Phoebe). After she came back, Brooke had an affair with her daughter Bridget's husband, Deacon Sharpe. Bridget was disgusted by this, and later Brooke gave birth to a daughter named Hope Logan {{as a result of the}} scandalous affair. Briefly during the pregnancy, she married a Forrester co-worker Whip Jones to cover up her adulterous affair.|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to elucidate the effect of different planting systems, videlicet (viz.) flat, <b>ridge,</b> and raised <b>bed</b> system on growth, yield and quality of gladiolus and stock. Corms of ‘Rose Supreme’ and ‘White Prosperity’ gladiolus and seedlings of ‘Cheerful White’, ‘Lucinda Dark Rose Double’ and ‘Lucinda Dark Rose Single’ stock were planted on different planting systems in individual experiments for each species. Gladiolus had similar good quality production irrespective of planting systems with numerical superiority of ridge planting, which produced longer stems with higher stem fresh weight, but delayed corm sprouting by ca. 1 d compared to raised bed or flat planting system. Among cultivars, ‘Rose Supreme’ produced higher number of florets per spike, taller stems with longer spikes, higher fresh weight of stems and higher number of cormels than ‘White Prosperity’. Stock plants grown on flat beds produced stems with greater stem length, leaf area and fresh weight of stems compared to <b>ridge</b> or raised <b>bed</b> planting systems. Plants grown on ridges produced the highest stem diameter, number of leaves per plant, total leaf chlorophyll contents, and number of flowers per spike. ‘Cheerful White’ and ‘Lucinda Dark Rose Double’ performed best by producing good quality stems in shorter period compared to ‘Lucinda Dark Rose Single’. In summary, gladiolus should be grown on ridges, while stock may be planted on flat beds for higher yields of better quality flowers...|$|R

40|$|Data is {{presented}} comparing infiltration of irrigation and rain water to potato crops planted in <b>ridges</b> and <b>beds</b> in East Anglia, UK. An automatic soil water station (ASWS) {{was used to}} monitor soil water content and potential in the two cultivation systems. The ASWS data indicated {{that most of the}} water bypassed the potatoes planted in ridges as irrigation water applied to the crop from a boom irrigator was shed off the ridges infiltrating in the furrows. This was due to the water repellent nature of the sandy soil and meant that the irrigation water bypassed the potatoes. A soil water deficit built up in the core of the ridge as the crop grew and was not replenished by irrigations. A second early potato crop planted in beds was more successful at capturing water as the flat bed increased water infiltration around the crop. This has major implications for cultivation practice, scab control and crop water management. Instruments measuring soil water potential, content, temperature and rainfall were connected to a data logger powered by a solar panel and proved a successful way of monitoring infiltration. Hourly data was collected so that a high temporal resolution data set could be constructed in order to increase conceptual understanding of hydrological processes at a scale appropriate to the crop. ...|$|R
40|$|Tribrachidium is a monospecific genus of the Ediacara biota that {{is found}} globally. In the Flinders Ranges of South Australia, the spatial {{distribution}} of Tribrachidium across the seafloor is best described as patchy. Although Tribrachidium is the dominant fossil {{on two of the}} twenty-six beds currently excavated and is present in large numbers on another, the genus most commonly occurs as no {{more than a handful of}} specimens on a bed. Tribrachidium size frequency distributions of each of the three beds with more than 5 specimens are all statistically distinguishable from one another. Additionally, the size range on any given bed is smaller than the overall size range observed for the genus. These patterns suggest that these organisms lived in populations composed of cohorts. The beds with numerous Tribrachidium come from different facies and are characterized by the presence of dissimilar mixes of taxa and textured organic surfaces, indicating that Tribrachidium was a generalist, able to adapt to a variety environments. Uniquely, the base or internal structure of Tribrachidium is also found preserved in both positive and negative relief as a sequence of concentric <b>ridges</b> on <b>beds</b> where Tribrachidium is the dominant genus. The most parsimonious explanation for the presence of these concentric ridge fossils is that they are the fossilized form of a Tribrachidium preserved when the organism was buried upside-down, flipped over, or partially decayed prior to burial...|$|R

Components of farm transportation in agri-cultural production are off-farm and on-farm Transport needs of the farmers have not been properly quantified, most importantly on the farm which is the main hub of his activities. A study was conducted to assess on-farm travel characteristics of small scale farmers in Nigeria during farming activities. On-farm movement parameters such as work-ing speed, workrate, field efficiency, power consumption and distance travelled were evaluated for some farm operations. The working speed during planting of maize and fertilizer application (manual) were both 0. 088 m/sec; bed construction had a working speed of 0. 013 m/sec.

A similar study was conducted on yam {{seedbed preparation}} in 2003 / 2004, with a 23 factorial design. Cassava and yams on ridges resulted in highest root and tuber yields, on both Lixisols in the coastal and forest-savanna transition and Acrisols in the forest agro-ecologies. However, yam tuber yield on mounds was not statistically different from yields on ridges.

40|$|Sand {{waves are}} more or less {{parallel}} <b>ridges,</b> making <b>bed</b> patterns in shallow seas. Due to their dimensions and migration rate, they can have a considerable effect on offshore human activities. In relation to such activities especially the variation in the sand wave characteristics (wave length, height and migration) are of importance. Due to the large spatial scale of sand waves and the different time scales involved for the tidal flow (hours) and the bed pattern changes (years to decades), modelling the sand wave behaviour from its initial stage up to its final equilibrium shape is a challenge, let alone to include the spatial variation within a sand wave field. In this paper a numerical solver is presented that describes sand waves from their initial state up to their final equilibrium. It is a 2 DV idealized model, based on non-linear stability analysis. Both the model equations and the numerical setup are described and the model is validated against linear stability analysis. To investigate variations in a field of sand waves and the interaction between individual waves, simulations on large domains are presented and show that this solver is able to describe the development of a realistic sand wave field, with variations, from an initially flat sand bed with small random disturbances. The solver shows to be a promising tool, it is computational fast due to the efficient numerical algorithms and is easy to extend with other physical processes.

40|$|A {{bathymetric}} {{map of the}} deep-sea floor off southeastern Africa shows the Agulhas Plateau {{to be separated from}} the continental margin of southeastern Africa by a narrow (50 km) elongate depression, the Agulhas Passage, which acts as a deep-water connection between the Agulhas and Transkei basins. Three regionally developed sediment layers occur in the deep (> 4500 m) Transkei Basin/Agulhas Passage area. With the aid of a simple ocean crust sinking/carbonate compensation level (CCL) model these layers are related to the sedimentation history of the area. The model suggests that acoustic basement (Horizon X) represents Lower Cretaceous limestones draped over oceanic basement, and that this is overlain by an acoustically transparent sequence of pelagic/terrigenous material (Horizon A) that was deposited during a lengthy period (95 m. y.) beneath the carbonate compensation level. Post-Late Miocene sedimentation (Horizons B and C) has probably taken place above the CCL.

40|$|Palynological and tephra {{information}} {{provides the}} foundation for correlation of five deep wells from the Great Salt Lake. Pollen correlations are primarily resolved using pollen percentage diagrams. Analysis of the individual tephra units allow correlation of tephras based on chemical similarities. Known regional tephras recognized {{in one or more}} of the wells are the Lava Creek B ash bed, the Bishop ash <b>bed,</b> the Huckleberry <b>Ridge</b> ash <b>bed,</b> the Santee ash bed and the Walcott ash bed. Absolute ages associated with these ash beds and three other units subsequently allow for the calculation of long term sediment accumulation rates at each well location. Sediment accumulation rates, averaged over the last 4 to 5 million years of record, range between 0. 18 mm/yr and 0. 43 mm/yr, with fairly constant rates within each well. The two longest records, which represent an approximated 16 million years, provide average sedimentation rates over this entire period of 0. 23 mm/yr and 0. 13 mm/yr. Neogene through Pleistocene paleoclimatic conditions are estimated using pollen percentages based on the pollen counts from all five wells. Quantitative climatic interpretations based on the palynology suggest close to modern, but slightly warmer and drier conditions from ca. 7 million years ago (Ma) to ca. 3. 5 Ma. The period lasting from ca. 3. 5 Ma to ca. 0. 7 Ma was characterized by a clearly hotter and more arid climate compared to today; though a short cool period may have occurred between 2. 7 and 2. 9 Ma. Conditions over the last 0. 7 Ma were generally cooler and moister than the previous period, and at times may have been significantly cooler and moister than the modern climate.

In this perspective a detailed and systematic series of field studies were undertaken for three consecutive years (2013 -   2015) at Soil Salinity Research Institute, Pindi Bhattian, Pakistan to evaluate different nitrogen levels and the cost-effective planting technique for onion production under salt affected conditions. The experiment was laid out in split plot arrangement using randomized complete block design having three replications. Two planting methods, <b>ridge</b> and <b>bed</b> planting and 4 nitrogen levels, 1 - recommended dose (RD) of N (90 kg ha - 1), 2 - 75 % N of RD (67. 5 kg ha - 1), 3 - 125 % N of RD (112. 5 kg ha - 1), 4 - 150 % N of RD (135 kg ha - 1) were used. Planting methods were kept in main plots and nitrogen levels in sub plots keeping sub-plot size of 4 m x 6 m. Measurements included were: plant height, number of leaves/plants/m - 2, bulb diameter, bulb mass, total bulb yield, number of flowers/umbel, seed mass/plant and 1000 -seed mass. Results showed that maximum onion yield and yield attributes were recorded with nitrogen application at rate of 150 & 125 of RD in ridge planting.

Taylor didn't know that Brooke staged the scene, getting Ridge drunk and out of his shirt and he still refused to make love to her. The truth about Thomas Forrester in fact being Ridge's son comes out, and he annuls his marriage to Brooke and returns to Taylor. In 1999, identical twin daughters, Steffy and Phoebe, are born.|$|R
40|$|A 200 -km-long and 10 -km-wide linear {{assemblage}} of till-filled geometrical <b>ridges</b> on the <b>bed</b> of the Maskwa palaeo-ice stream {{of the late}} Wisconsinan southwest Laurentide Ice Sheet are interpreted as crevasse-squeeze ridges (CSR) developed during internal flow unit reorganization, immediately prior to ice stream shutdown. Ridge orientations are predominantly orientated WNW–ESE, with a subordinate WSW–ENE alignment, both indicative of ice fracture development transverse to former ice stream flow, as indicated by NNE–SSW aligned MSGL. Subglacial till injection into basal and/or full depth, mode I and II crevasses occurred at the approximate centreline of the ice stream, in response to extension and fracturing. Landform preservation indicates that this {{took place during the}} final stages of ice streaming, immediately prior to ice stream shutdown. This linear zone of ice fracturing therefore likely represents the narrowing of the fast-flowing trunk, similar to the plug flow identified in some surging valley glaciers. Lateral drag between the final active flow unit and the slower moving ice on either side is likely recorded by the up-ice bending of the CSR limbs. The resulting CSR corridor, here related to an individual ice stream flow unit, constitutes a previously unreported style of crevasse infilling and contrasts with two existing CSR patterns: (1) wide arcuate zones of CSRs related to widespread fracturing within glacier surge lobes; and (2) narrow concentric arcs of CSRs and recessional push moraines related to submarginal till deformation at active temperate glacier lobes...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to simulate water and nitrogen transfers under two furrow irrigation technologies (every furrow irrigation (EFI) and alternative furrow irrigation (AFI)) on Chromic Luvisol in Sofia region, Bulgaria. A bi-dimensional water and solutes transport modeling approach, HYDRUS- 2 D model [Simunek, J., Sejna, M., Van Genuchten, M. T., 1999. The HYDRUS- 1 D and HYDRUS- 2 D codes for estimating unsaturated soil hydraulic and solutes transport parameters. Agron Abstr. 357] is adopted in order to consider the technology of irrigation and fertilization. The model is calibrated in six steps using detailed data observed in two cropped lysimeters. The data consist of water and nitrogen (N) profiles below <b>ridge</b> and furrow <b>bed,</b> precipitation, drainage and water/N uptake by plant. Hydrological components of the soil are derived from laboratory: water retention data (step (i)) and adjusted to field conditions when EFI is approximated by one-dimensional (step (ii)). Then a two-dimensional water flow is adopted in model simulations for parameter calibration and verification, under EFI (step (iii)) and under AFI technology (step (iv)). This model calibration and validation is then used to calibrate the solute transport parameters, that is the aim of step (v) and step (vi). EFI and particularly AFI technologies points out the necessary 2 D model using for the N transfer simulation under specific fertilizer applications. Thus, this calibrated model allows predicting the impact of furrow irrigation practices and distribution uniformity on drainage and nitrogen leaching under the studied conditions. ...|$|R
50|$|About {{a century}} ago, the bambooworking was only {{limited to the}} making of living {{materials}} and productive tools such as hats, buckets, food steamers, dustpans, tables and chairs, <b>beds,</b> <b>ridges</b> and so on; when Taiwan was invaded by the Japanese {{at the end of}} the 19th century, the bamboo weaving skills were widely extended from the living and production use to the field of stationery, decoration, and even arts. In the meanwhile, the rough weaving skills were refined to be more delicate. The stationery case and lamp cover, which was woven by the Japanese artist at the Guangxu Times in Qing dynasty in China, was first discovered by Wang Zhenduo. Both these two bamboo products are beautiful in color, discreet in skills, and fashionable in pattern, which makes it too attractive to be released from one’s hands. The stationery case is 30 centimeters in length, 18 centimeters in width, and 8 centimeters in height. Woven by a number of bamboo strips of 0.5 cm in width, the stationery case has such average gaps between every two strips that it seems as if it were produced by the assembly line in the factory rather than made by human hands. Besides, the purplish red bamboo strips, where letter paper and thread-bound books were placed, appear quite simple and historically meaningful. As for the lamp cover, it is 23 centimeters in length, and 5 centimeters in width. Seeing the brown bamboo filament on the lamp and the paper-cut window decoration, one must be reminiscent of a simply-dressed and elegant host of the room.|$|R
