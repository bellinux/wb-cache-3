5|$|Basil cultivars are {{cultivated}} {{varieties of}} basil. They {{are used in}} a variety of ways: as culinary herbs, landscape plants, healing herbs, teas, and worship implements. All true basils are species of the genus Ocimum. The genus is particularly diverse, and includes annuals, non-woody perennials and shrubs native to Africa and other tropical and subtropical regions of the Old and New World. Although it is estimated that there are 50 to 150 species of basil, most, but not all, culinary basils are cultivars of O. basilicum, or sweet basil. Some are cultivars of other basil species, and others are hybrids. It is particularly challenging to determine which species a basil belongs to. This is because basil cross-breeds easily, and drawing boundaries between species is particularly difficult. In fact, recent studies have led to <b>reclassification</b> of some portions of the genus.|$|E

40|$|Customs {{classification}} is {{an important}} element in a country's trade policy. How a good is classified can affect the rate of duty that applies, the coverage of non-tariff barriers, and the formulation and application of rules of origin. <b>Reclassifications</b> can occur because of the introduction of a new product, but also because of protectionist motives. This paper is the first attempt at explaining these <b>reclassifications.</b> Focusing on the European Union, I examine whether the number of tariff lines in an industry result from the introduction of new products or from protectionist lobbying. The analysis focuses on 90 manufacturing industries over 12 years. Results suggest that protectionist lobbying does play a role in explaining changes in the EU's customs classification.

5|$|Early {{descriptions}} of the species came from Carl Ludwig Willdenow, who named it Lichen carneus in 1787, and Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard, who, in 1790, named it Auricularia corticalis. However, the sanctioned name is Thelephora quercina, given by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801, and sanctioned by Elias Magnus Fries in {{the first volume of}} his Systema Mycologicum. The specific name quercina is in reference to Quercus, the generic name for oak. A number of authors (including Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, Lucien Quélet and Giacomo Bresadola) reclassified Bulliard's Auricularia corticalis throughout the 19th century, while Persoon's Thelephora quercina was reclassified by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821, who placed it in Corticium as Corticium quercinum. However, in 1879, Mordecai Cubitt Cooke transferred the species to his newly described genus Peniophora, declaring it the type species. Despite subsequent attempts at <b>reclassification,</b> Cooke's name is the one currently used.|$|E
5|$|Prionomyrmecini is an ant tribe {{belonging}} to the subfamily Myrmeciinae established by William Morton Wheeler in 1915. Two members {{are a part of}} this tribe, the extant Nothomyrmecia and the extinct Prionomyrmex. The tribe was once considered a subfamily due to the similarities between Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex, but such <b>reclassification</b> was not widely accepted by the scientific community. These ants can be identified by their long slender bodies, powerful stingers and elongated mandibles. Fossil Prionomyrmecini ants were once found throughout Europe, possibly nesting in trees and preferring jungle habitats. Today, Prionomyrmecini is only found in Australia, preferring old-growth mallee woodland surrounded by Eucalyptus trees. Nothomyrmecia workers feed on nectar and arthropods, using their compound eyes for prey and navigational purposes. Owing to their primitive nature, they do not recruit others to food sources or create pheromone trails. Nothomyrmecia colonies are small, consisting of 50 to 100 individuals.|$|E

As Tasmania's highest-ranking war hero, he was greeted by the Governor of Tasmania, Sir Francis Newdegate. On August 1919 he accepted an offer from the Premier of Tasmania, Walter Lee, of the post of Public Service Commissioner. He investigated {{the conditions of the}} service, and found that public servants were agitating for a 40 per cent pay rise, as no pay rises had been granted since before the war. He {{came up with a plan}} for a temporary <b>reclassification</b> of positions, which would offer some relief, at a cost to the government of £12,000. This was implemented in December.

5|$|Hermann Schlegel first {{proposed}} in 1857 that the species {{belonged to the}} starling family (Sturnidae), reclassifying {{it as part of}} the Sturnus genus S. capensis. This <b>reclassification</b> was observed by other authors; Carl Jakob Sundevall proposed the new genus name Lophopsarus ("crested starling") in 1872, yet Fregilupus varius—the oldest name—remains the bird's binomial, and all other scientific names are synonyms. In 1874, after a detailed analysis of the only known skeleton (held at the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology), James Murie agreed that it was a starling. Richard Bowdler Sharpe said in 1890 that the hoopoe starling was similar to the starling genus Basilornis, but did not note any similarities other than their crests. In 1941, Malcolm R. Miller found the bird's musculature {{similar to that of the}} common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) after he dissected a specimen preserved in spirits at the Cambridge Museum, but noted that the tissue was very degraded and the similarity did not necessarily confirm a relationship with starlings. In 1957, Andrew John Berger cast doubt on the bird's affinity with starlings due to subtle anatomical differences, after dissecting a spirit specimen at the American Museum of Natural History. Some authors proposed a relationship with vangas (Vangidae), but Hiroyuki Morioka rejected this in 1996, after a comparative study of skulls.|$|E
5|$|Redevelopment of the {{disturbance}} {{was a possibility}} following its degeneration, and on August19, convection once again increased, prompting the JTWC to resume monitoring {{the system as a}} tropical depression at 0900UTC, with the JMA following suit nine hours later. Due to slight wind shear, the depression's circulation center remained slightly displaced from the stronger convection. At 0600UTC on August20, the JTWC determined that {{the disturbance}} had intensified to reach tropical storm status. Upon the 1200UTC upgrade to such an intensity by the JMA, the tropical cyclone was assigned the name Krovanh. Subsequently, following <b>reclassification,</b> Krovanh began to quickly intensify as it tracked in a somewhat southwest bearing. By August21, the tropical storm had begun to develop a banding eye feature. At 0600UTC that day, the JMA upgraded Krovanh to severe tropical storm intensity, whilst the JTWC indicated that the storm intensified into a typhoon. On August22, the JMA reassessed Krovanh as a typhoon and determined that the storm had reached its peak intensity with winds of 120km/h (75mph). Meanwhile, the JTWC analyzed the storm to have peaked with one-minute sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph); this was followed by the storm making landfall on Luzon, just north of Palanan, Isabela, at 1115UTC later that day.|$|E
5|$|The green-head ant {{was first}} {{described}} in 1858 by British entomologist Frederick Smith in his Catalogue of Hymenopterous Insects in the Collection of the British Museum part VI, under the binomial name Ponera metallica {{based on two}} syntypes; a worker and a queen he collected in Adelaide, South Australia. These specimens were later reviewed in 1958 with the designation of a lectotype from the syntypes, but it is unclear which specimen was designated. The material is currently housed in the Natural History Museum in London. In 1862 Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr moved the species from the genus Ponera {{and placed it in}} Rhytidoponera as Ectatomma (Rhytidoponera) metallicum, which at the time was a newly erected subgenus of Ectatomma. Mayr's original <b>reclassification</b> was short-lived as in 1863 he moved the ant from Rhytidoponera to Ectatomma. In 1897 Italian entomologist Carlo Emery named the ant Rhytidoponera metallica and in 1911 designated it as the type species of Chalcoponera, a subgenus of Rhytidoponera; the ant was, however, mistakenly identified as the type species of Rhytidoponera by some scientists.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} Typhoon Vera can be ascertained {{back to a}} diffuse area of low {{pressure}} first incorporated into surface weather analysis early on September20. At the time, the disturbance was situated between Guam and Chuuk State. Though the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) did not classify the incipient system as a tropical cyclone, the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) analyzed the disturbance to be a tropical depression as early as 0000UTC that day. Initially, the depression tracked westward, but transiently shifted to a more northerly course on September21. Late that day, a reconnaissance airplane dispatched by the JTWC to analyze the disturbance failed to reach its center due to engine failure. However, the data collected from the storm's periphery was sufficient enough for the warning center to classify the depression as a tropical storm at 1800UTC that day. Despite the flight data, the JMA had already determined the system to have been of at least tropical storm intensity six hours earlier. As a result of the <b>reclassification,</b> the tropical storm was designated the name Vera by the JTWC. At this point the tropical cyclone began to take a more westerly course.|$|E
