40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinising {{disease of}} {{the central nervous system}} which accounts for functional impairment and lasting disability in young adults. It occurs as a result of some combination of genetic susceptibility, deregulation of the immune system and environmental factors such as infectious and possibly other factors like vascular problems. The objective {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate if an intensive short-term inpatient rehabilitation program is able to improve clinical and functional outcome in multiple sclerosis patients. Methods: 15 patients with multiple sclerosis (mean age 37. 06 Â± 9. 66 years) were assigned to Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. All patients were included in an intensive short-term rehabilitation program (strength and cardio respiratory exercises). Subjects attended 60 -min sessions three times a week for 12 weeks. Ruffier-Dickson and Hettinger tests were performed. The patients were assessed before and after this physical intervention. Results: From the total 25 patients 50 % were with remitting multiple sclerosis, 30 % with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and 20 % with primary progressive multiple sclerosis. The EDSS score was improved in 70 % of studied cases. All subjects recorded a better cardio respiratory performance evaluated by <b>Ruffier-Dickson</b> <b>test.</b> Hettinger assessment recorded after 12 weeks an improvement of 80 % in the functional state. Conclusions: Strength (or resistance) training and cardio respiratory (or endurance) training are two basic physical exercises widely used in neurological rehabilitation. Application of an intensive rehabilitation program determines increasing of functional and cardio respiratory capacity in patients with multiple sclerosis...|$|E
