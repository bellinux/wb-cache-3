Principal component analysis was used for exploratory data analysis and cross-validated one-block partial least-squares models were employed for calibration. Root mean square errors of prediction, based on 4 – 8 PLS factors, were close to the measured repeatability values and below the limits defined by ASTM methods.

In the low <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> range (<b>relative</b> <b>density</b> < 0. 5 – 0. 6), porous copper showed a density exponent n of 2. 3, where n represents the <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> dependence of yield strength.

Methods A Region-of-Interest (ROI) CT number mapping method was developed to generate the cone-beam CT number vs. <b>relative</b> electron <b>density</b> calibration <b>curve</b> for 3 D dose calculations. The stability of the results was validated for three consecutive months. The method was evaluated on three brain tumors and three head-and-neck tumor cases. For each patient, kV-CBCT images were acquired on the first treatment day and two-week intervals on the Elekta XVI system. The delivered dose distributions were calculated by applying the patients' treatment plans to the kV-CBCT images. The resulting dose distributions and dose volume histograms (DVHs) of the tumor and critical structures were compared to the original treatment plan. Results The kV-CBCT electron density calibration was stable within 1. 5 % over a three-month period. The DVH and dose distribution comparison based on the planning CT and the initial kV-CBCT showed good agreements for majority of cases. The doses calculated from the planning CT and kV-CBCT were compared on planes perpendicular to the beam axes and passing through the isocenter. Using γ analysis with a criterion of 2 mm/ 2 % and a threshold of 10 %, more than 99. 5 % of the points on the iso-planes exhibited γ Conclusions ROI mapping method is an effective method {{for the creation of}} kV-CBCT electron <b>density</b> calibration <b>curves</b> for head-and-neck and brain tumor patients.

It was known that mechanical properties and shear strength of sand are closely related to <b>relative</b> <b>density.</b> Therefore {{it is very important to}} determine accurate <b>relative</b> <b>density.</b> In this study, Portable Cone Penetration Tester (PCPT) was used to estimate the <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> and the internal friction angle of sand. PCPT cone-tip resistance (qc) was measured changing the <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> of the two soil samples–Standard sand (JMJ) and Busan sand (BS). Also, a direct shear test was performed to investigate relationship between <b>relative</b> <b>density</b> and internal friction angle.
