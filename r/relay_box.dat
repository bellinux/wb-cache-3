50|$|Discovery (April 5-20, 2010), a {{resupply}} {{mission to}} the International Space Station, was launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center. On arrival at the station, Discovery’s crew dropped off more than 27,000 pounds of hardware, supplies and equipment, including a tank full of ammonia coolant, new crew sleeping quarters, and three experiment racks. As the EVA lead, Mastracchio performed three spacewalks during this mission and logged 20 hours and 17 minutes of evtravehicular activity. On the return journey, the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module inside Discovery’s payload bay was packed with over 6,000 pounds of hardware, science results, and trash. The STS-131 mission was accomplished in 15 days, 02 hours, 47 minutes, 10 seconds, and traveled 6,232,235 statute miles in 238 orbits.Mastracchio launched on Expedition 38/39 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to the International Space Station along with Soyuz Commander Mikhail Tyurin of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Flight Engineer Koichi Wakata. During his stay aboard the space station, Mastracchio conducted three spacewalks, the first two to remove and replace a faulty cooling pump, and the third to remove and replace a failed backup computer <b>relay</b> <b>box.</b> Mastracchio, Tyurin and Wakata returned to Earth after 188 days in space. During the expedition, the crew completed 3,008 orbits of the Earth and traveled more than 79.8 million miles.|$|E
50|$|The Proxima {{mission will}} include 50 science {{experiments}} for ESA and CNES. The mission {{is named after}} Proxima Centauri, continuing the French astronauts' tradition of naming the missions after stars and constellations. The X inside the logo symbolizes that Pesquet is the tenth French astronaut {{as well as the}} unknown. The Proxima mission name was chosen in a competition, with the winning name given by 13-year-old Samuel Planas from Toulouse, France. The mission logo was designed by Thomas Pesquet and Karen Oldenburg.Pesquet performed his first EVA with astronaut Shane Kimbrough on January 13, 2017. During the EVA, they prepared the infrastructure to replace the ISS batteries. The EVA lasted for 5 hours and 58 minutes.On March 23 2017, Pesquet performed his second career EVA with Shane Kimbrough. The main objective was to prepare the Pressurized Mating Adapter-3 (PMA-3) for installation of the second International Docking Adapter (IDA), which will accommodate commercial crew vehicle dockings. The PMA-3 provides the pressurized interface between the station modules and the docking adapter. Expedition 50 Commander Kimbrough and Pesquet disconnected cables and electrical connections on PMA-3 to prepare for its robotic move on March 26, 2017. PMA-3 will be moved from the port side of the Tranquility module to the space-facing side of the Harmony module, where it will become home for the docking adapter, which will be delivered on a future flight of a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship. The spacewalkers also installed on the starboard zero truss (ITS) a new computer <b>relay</b> <b>box</b> equipped with advanced software for the adapter.The two spacewalkers lubricated the latching end effector on the Canadarm2 robotic arm, inspected a radiator valve suspected of a small ammonia leak and replaced cameras on the Japanese segment of the outpost. Radiators are used to shed excess heat that builds up through normal space station operation. The EVA lasted for 6 hours and 34 minutes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a method to}} characterize the dynamic behavior of a normal production hydraulic brake system through experiments on a hardware-in-the-loop test bench for both modeling (part I) and control (part II) tasks. The activity is relative to the analysis, modeling, and control of anti-lock braking system and electronic stability control digital valves, and is aimed at obtaining reference tracking and disturbance-rejection performance similar to that achievable when using pressure proportional valves. The {{first part of this}} two-part study is focused on the development of a mathematical model that emulates the pressure dynamics inside a brake caliper when the inlet valve, outlet valve, and motor pump are controlled by digital or pulse width modulated signals. The model takes into account some inherent nonlinearities of these systems, e. g. the variation of fluid bulk modulus with pressure, while inlet and outlet valves together with the <b>relay</b> <b>box</b> are modeled as second-order systems with variable gains. The hardware-in-the-loop test rig is used for both parameter estimation and model validation; the parameters and model will be used for the control strategy development presented {{in the second part of}} this study...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWith over 300 billion vehicle trips {{made in the}} USA and 64 {{billion in}} France per year, network {{operators}} {{have the opportunity to}} utilize the existing road and highway network as an alternative data network to offload large amounts of delay-tolerant traffic. To enable the road network as a large-capacity transmission system, we exploit the existing mobility of vehicles equipped with wireless and storage capacities together with a collection of offloading spots. An offloading spot is a data storage equipment located where vehicles usually park. Data is transloaded from a conventional data network to the closest offloading spot and then shipped by vehicles along their line of travel. The subsequent offloading spots act as data <b>relay</b> <b>boxes</b> where vehicles can drop off data for later pickups by other vehicles, depending on their direction of travel. The main challenges of this offloading system are how to compute the road path matching the performance requirements of a data transfer and how to configure the sequence of offloading spots involved in the transfer. We propose a scalable and adaptive centralized architecture built on SDN that maximizes the utilization of the flow of vehicles connecting consecutive offloading spots. We simulate the performance of our system using real roads traffic counts for France. Results show that the centralized controlled offloading architecture can achieve an efficient and fair allocation of concurrent data transfers between major cities in France...|$|R

50|$|A {{train describer}} is {{originally}} an additional apparatus at British railways that {{ensures that the}} identity of each train is displayed on the signalbox panel together with the indication of that train's presence, usually offering routing information. This routing information would then be passed through to the platform display for passenger information. Technically the train reporting number was pushed from one signal box to the next. A series of interconnected signal boxes form a train describer system (TDS) transferring train describer data to be shown on the respective signalbox panel in a train describer display. The electric <b>relay</b> interlocking <b>boxes</b> were later replaced by electronic control boards where the train indication is just a text element on the video display.|$|R

5000|$|As {{a result}} of the {{divisions}} of Germany and Berlin, traffic flows changed. The line from Berlin via Jüterbog to Bitterfeld and continuing to Halle and Leipzig remained {{one of the most important}} lines of the GDR. Berlin was no longer reached directly over the Anhalterbahn, instead trains ran from Ludwigsfelde over the Berlin outer ring. Operations on the light railway, which were established for passenger traffic in 1932 and for freight traffic in 1939, were resumed after 1945. One track was extended from the light railway station to the main station. The light railway operations finally ended in 1963. Many military installations in and around Jüterbog were used by the Soviet Army after 1945. Accordingly, the station was also important for the Soviet Army. In addition to material transports, there were also military passenger trains. A separate entrance building was built in the south-west of the station for travellers to check-in. In 1974, the station received a new <b>relay</b> signal <b>box</b> of the GS III Sp68 class, the first of its kind. It went into operation on 19 September 1974 and replaced three mechanical signal boxs. It was housed in a striking building on the north-western side of the railway tracks. Electric catenary was installed in the station on 27 May 1979. First, the line to south-west went into operation on 1 June and the line to Luckenwalde followed in 1980. In the following years, electric operations gradually increased to the Berlin outer ring and later to the north. The section from Jüterbog to Falkenberg was also electrified in September 1989.|$|R

40|$|Cancer cells contain {{genetic damage}} of two sorts (Bishop 1991) : dominant, with targets known as proto-oncogenes; and recessive, with targets known most {{commonly}} as tumor suppressor genes. The lesions in proto-oncogenes cause an unwanted gain of function, whereas {{the damage to}} tumor suppressor genes typical-ly causes loss of function. Proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are generally thought of as governors of cellular proliferation, with the former serving as accelerators, the latter as brakes. Jam an accelerator or remove a brake, and the cell is unleashed to relentless division. Useful as this view may be, it is erroneously simplistic. In reality, many proto-oncogenes and at least some tumor suppressor genes have diverse, even paradoxical functions that vary with cellular and phys-iological context: There is plasticity in the machine. Until we can understand the nature and genesis of that plasticity, {{it is unlikely that}} we will be able to fully understand the biochemical maladies of cancer cells. The plasticity displayed by proto-oncogenes is better understood than that of tumor suppressor genes and is based on the physiological role of these genes in the lives of metazoan organisms.
