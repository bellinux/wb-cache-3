40|$|The {{importance}} of railway transportation {{has been increasing}} in the world. Considering the current and future estimates of high cargo and passenger transportation volume in railways, prevention or reduction of delays due to any failure is becoming ever more crucial. <b>Railway</b> <b>turnout</b> systems {{are one of the}} most critical pieces of equipment in railway infrastructure. When incipient failures occur, they mostly progress slowly from the fault free to the failure state. Although studies focusing on the identification of possible failures in <b>railway</b> <b>turnout</b> systems exist in the literature, neither the detection nor forecasting of failure progression has been reported. This paper presents a simple state-based prognostic method that aims to detect and forecast failure progression in electro-mechanical systems. The method is compared with Hidden Markov Model based methods on real data collected from a <b>railway</b> <b>turnout</b> system. Obtaining statistically sufficient failure progression samples is difficult considering that the natural progression of failures in electro-mechanical systems may take years. In addition, validating the classification model is difficult when the degradation is not observable. Data collection and model validation strategies for failure progression are also presented...|$|E

The most critical sleepers in the <b>railway</b> <b>turnout</b> system were assigned with a modulus of elasticity (MOE) of 4 GPa while keeping the elastic modulus of the other sleepers the same. The analysis showed that a spot replacement sleeper with a low MOE leads to a lowering overall stiffness of the railway track. It resulted in a reduction in the bending moment and shear and an increase in the vertical deflection of the sleeper directly under the rail seat load. Results also showed that a spot replacement sleeper material with an MOE of 4 GPa will distribute the load evenly in the neighboring timber sleepers. ...|$|E

A collaborative effort between the Centre of Excellence in Engineered Fibre Composites (CEEFC) and Austrak Pty Ltd aims to develop an optimised fibre composite turnout sleeper for replacing deteriorated hardwood sleepers in <b>railway</b> <b>turnouts.</b> The building block of this alternative sleeper material is a new generation composite sandwich structure made up of glass fibre reinforced polymer skins and high strength core material.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study on the}} flexural and shear behaviour of the full-scale glue-laminated composite sandwich beams in three different layouts was conducted to evaluate the suitability of this construction system for <b>railway</b> <b>turnout</b> sleepers. The building block of this innovative beam is a novel composite sandwich structure made up of glass fibre composite skins and modified phenolic core material that has been specifically developed for civil engineering applications. The sandwich beam is produced by gluing layers of fibre composite sandwich structure together in flatwise (horizontal) and in edgewise (vertical) orientations. The glued sandwich beams with edgewise laminations presented appropriate strength and stiffness for replacement turnout timber sleeper. The mechanical properties of these glue-laminated sandwich beams are comparable with the existing timber turnout sleepers demonstrating that the innovative composite sandwich beam is a viable alternative sleeper material for railway turnouts. From this study, it is concluded that the glue-laminated composite sandwich structures {{have the potential to}} be used for replacement <b>railway</b> <b>turnout</b> sleepers.

40|$|A {{simplified}} grillage beam analogy {{was performed}} to investigate the behaviour of <b>railway</b> <b>turnout</b> sleeper system with a low value of elastic modulus on different support moduli. This study aimed at determining an optimum modulus of elasticity for an emerging technology for <b>railway</b> <b>turnout</b> application - fibre composites sleeper. The finite element simulation suggests that the changes in modulus of elasticity of sleeper, Esleeper and the sleeper support modulus, Us have a significant influence on the behaviour of turnout sleepers. The increase in Us from 10 to 40 MPa resulted in a 15 % reduction in the bending moment while the increase in Esleeper from 1 GPa to 10 GPa has resulted in almost 75 % increase in the bending moment. The shear forces in turnout sleepers is not sensitive to both the changes of the Esleeper and Us while the sleeper with low Esleeper tend to undergo greater settlement into the ballast. An Esleeper of 4 GPa was found optimal for an alternative fibre composite turnout sleeper provided that the Us is at least 20 MPa from the consideration of sleeper ballast pressure and maximum vertical deflection. It was established that the turnout sleeper has a maximum bending moment of 19 kN-m and a shear force of 158 kN under service conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Railway</b> <b>turnouts</b> are {{important}} components of railway infrastructure as they provide flexibility and guidance {{to the rail}} traffic. Because of geometrical discontinuities in the crossing area of the turnouts, high impact forces due to passing wheels acting on the crossing nose can occur. In the field, severe rail damage problems are found in crossing areas. Statistical evidence shows that turnout failures cause major operational disturbances in a railway network, which lead to higher maintenance costs as compared with other track components. The research presented here was motivated by the short service life of the turnout crossing observed in the Dutch railway network and {{by the need to}} improve the performance of <b>railway</b> <b>turnouts.</b> Moreover, {{there is a lack of}} advanced numerical tools such as dynamic three-dimensional (3 -D) models to analyse wheel–rail interactions in crossings on the stress and strain levels, particularly for models that are coupled with life estimation of the crossing. Therefore, the goal of this study is to develop numerical tools for the analysis of the dynamic interaction between the wheel and turnout crossing, and the prediction of fatigue life of crossings, aiming to improve the crossing performance and prolong its service life.

40|$|Severe wear is {{a common}} damage {{mechanism}} in <b>railway</b> <b>turnouts,</b> which strongly affects the dynamic performance of railway vehicles and maintenance costs of tracks. This article explores the effects of profile wear on contact behaviors in the wheel–rail/switch contact and dynamic interaction, and nominal and measured worn turnout rail profiles are used as boundary conditions of wheel–rail contact. The calculation of the dynamic loads and the resultant contact stresses and internal stresses {{makes it possible to}} rationally design <b>railway</b> <b>turnouts</b> and correctly select the material to be applied for their components. For these reasons, the multi-body system SIMPACK and finite element software ANSYS are used to calculate the features of load and subsequently distributions of contact stresses and internal stresses in the regions of wheel–turnout components. The results show that profile wear disturbs the distribution of wheel–rail contact point pairs, changes the positions of wheel–rail contact points along the longitudinal direction, and affects the dynamic interaction of vehicle and turnout. For the measured profile in this article, profile wear aggravates vertical dynamic responses significantly but improves lateral dynamic responses. Profile wear disturbs the normal contact situations between the wheel and switch rail and worsens the stress state of the switch rail...|$|R
40|$|Rail {{turnouts}} {{are built}} to enable {{flexibility in the}} rail network as they allow for vehicles to switch between various tracks, therefore maximizing the utilisation of existing rail infrastructure. In general, <b>railway</b> <b>turnouts</b> are a safety-critical and expensive feature to a rail system as they suffer aggressive operational loads, in comparison to a plain rail track, and thus require frequent monitoring and maintenance. In practice, great consideration {{is given to the}} dynamic interaction between the turnouts components as a failed component may have adverse effects on the performance of neighbouring components. This paper presents a nonlinear 3 D finite element (FE) model, taking into account the nonlinearities of materials, in order to evaluate the interaction and behaviour of turnout components. Using ABAQUS, the finite element model was developed to simulate standard concrete bearers with 60 [*]kg/m rail and with a tangential turnout radius of 250 [*]m. The turnout structure is supported by a ballast layer, which is represented by a nonlinearly deformable tensionless solid.

40|$|Abstract‘Big data’ {{obtained}} from wayside detection systems and sensors installed {{on board a}} train show that actual loading history for a railway track is rather dynamic and transient. The dynamic loadings due to train and track interactions redistribute from the rails to the rail pad, from the rail pad to the railway sleeper, and from the railway sleeper to the underlying ground. Dynamic content redistributed onto each layer of track is also filtered by energy dissipation characteristic of materials and structures. As a critical infrastructure, <b>railway</b> <b>turnout</b> is a structural grillage system used to divert a train to other directions or other tracks. The wheel–rail contact over the crossing transfer zone often causes detrimental impact loads that rapidly deteriorate the turnout and its components. The dynamic responses of wheel–rail interaction depend largely on the non-smooth trajectory or wearing condition of crossing geometry. In reality, a railway line spreads over a large distance and monitoring such rail infrastructure {{is one of the}} challenges in rail industry.

40|$|Track {{stiffness}} in railway turnouts is variable due {{to differences}} in structural composition along the longitudinal direction, which will lead to severe dynamic interaction between train and turnout. In this paper, a transient analysis model is presented to investigate the stiffness characteristics of high-speed railway turnouts based on the finite element method and is applied to optimise the stiffness of railway turnouts. Furthermore, the effect of the stiffness variations on the dynamic train-turnout interaction is analysed. The calculation results show that the track stiffness characteristics are similar in the main and diverging line of <b>railway</b> <b>turnout,</b> except for the check rail sections. Due to the existence of shared baseplates and spacer blocks between different rails, the stiffness variations in the crossing panel are most severe in high-speed railway turnouts. The stiffness differences (calculated as the ratio of the maximum and minimum stiffness) of the longitudinal and lateral direction for Chinese number 18 ballasted turnout are 216 % and 229 %, respectively. The graded stiffness of the tie pads has been redesigned to optimise the stiffness of <b>railway</b> <b>turnout</b> based on the transient analysis model and the stiffness differences of the turnout are decreased. Altogether, the dynamic train-turnout interaction is enhanced remarkably by considering the turnout’s stiffness characteristics...|$|E
