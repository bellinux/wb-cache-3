The controlling relay monitors voltage and current in the transformer, and opens or closes the contact mechanism through electrical signals. The relay uses a power/time curve so that small, short term <b>reverse</b> <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> (such as from elevator hoists) are ignored.

40|$|Abstract—The {{ability of}} wind {{power park modules}} to control their {{response}} to transmission network faults allows for specification of new control features directed at stabilising the power system response during and after disturbances. However, the ‘effectiveness’ of these features in situations where wind power park modules are connected to ‘weak’ systems needs further clarification. The objective of the paper is to study the response of wind power park modules in distribution systems to transmission network faults during <b>reverse</b> <b>power</b> <b>flows.</b> The focus lies on the ‘effectiveness’ of their fast voltage control. A sensitivity analysis is performed to understand the differences made by the pre-fault operating point, the wind power park module’s fault and post-fault control modes and their settings, and the load modelling. The results show that correct load modelling is very important, the post-fault transmission system voltage recovery is worsened during <b>reverse</b> <b>power</b> <b>flows,</b> and that reactive current injection significantly affects the post-fault voltage recovery. Certain grid connection requirements worsened voltage recovery or even caused instability for some control settings...|$|R

We study the stability characteristics of distribution networks with <b>reversed</b> <b>power</b> <b>flow.</b> After introducing a universal algebraic approach to characterize all the solutions of the <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> equations, we show that new solutions appear in the <b>reversed</b> <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> regime even in the simplest three bus systems.

These predictions are validated with dynamic simulations of two different systems. Under certain conditions the new states are viable and may be characterized by relatively high voltages. Possible approaches towards reactive power/voltage regulation as well as permissible distributed generation capacity in future power systems are proposed and discussed in the end of the paper.

40|$|High {{penetration}} of distributed generators (DGs) using {{renewable energy sources}} (RESs) is raising some important issues {{in the operation of}} modern po­wer system. The output power of RESs fluctuates very steeply, and that include uncertainty with weather conditions. This situation causes voltage deviation and <b>reverse</b> <b>power</b> <b>flow.</b> Several methods have been proposed for solving these problems. Fundamentally, these methods involve reactive power control for voltage deviation and/or the installation of large battery energy storage system (BESS) at the interconnection point for <b>reverse</b> <b>power</b> <b>flow.</b> In order to reduce the installation cost of static var compensator (SVC), Distribution Company (DisCo) gives reactive power incentive to the cooperating customers.

40|$|Single-phase {{distributed}} {{energy resources}} (DERs), such as rooftop photovoltaic arrays, are usually installed based on the need and affordability of clients without any regard to the power demand of the connected phase of a three-phase system. It might so happen that the power generation in a particular phase is more than its load demand. This may cause a <b>reverse</b> <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> in a particular phase, especially in a three-phase, four-wire distribution system. If now the load demand {{in the other two}} phases is more than their respective generations, then these two phases will see a forward power flow, while there will be a <b>reverse</b> <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> in the third phase. This will create severe unbalance in the upstream network. In this paper, a distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) is used to circulate the excess generation from one phase to the others such that a set of balanced currents flow from or into the upstream network. Two different topologies of DSTATCOM are proposed in this paper for the low and medium voltage feeders. Two different power circulation strategies are developed for this purpose. Furthermore, a suitable feedback scheme is developed for each topology for power converter control. The performance of the proposed topologies and the control schemes for the DSTATCOM is evaluated through computer simulation studies using PSCAD/EMTDC...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} number of distributed generation connections to distribution networks, the need for better understanding of the distribution network constraints becomes crucial. As distribution networks have not been traditionally designed for two-way <b>power</b> <b>flow,</b> the <b>reverse</b> <b>power</b> <b>flows</b> due to the integration of distributed generation changes voltage profiles and can create significant network management issues related to both thermal and voltage limits. Whilst a large body of theory exists on the management of voltage profiles and the integration of distributed generation into voltage-constrained feeders, there has been limited real world application of these methods to date, in part because network operators are reluctant to undertake significant changes that may affect the reliability of their network. This paper provides a case study of three adjustments to existing management of an 11 kV feeder that are simple and feasible to implement and evaluates their impact on connection capacity for distributed generation including the importance of location. These adjustments are: increased operational upper-voltage levels, simple demand-management, and non-firm connections to manage local voltage constraints...|$|R
40|$|Installation of {{single-phase}} rooftop photovoltaic (PV) {{systems in}} low voltage (LV) residential feeders without controlling their ratings and locations may deteriorate the overall grid performance including <b>reversed</b> <b>power</b> <b>flows,</b> high losses and unacceptable voltage profiles.

The uncertainty of the intermittent DGs, DG plug-in and plug-out, bidirectional power flow, as well as the diversity of loads, often cause disturbances such as over-voltage or <b>reverse</b> <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> in an ADS, hence, the ADS control has attracted increasing attention [4, 5].|$|E

However, unity power factors (PFs) of WSs were assumed in those studies to analyze the potential of BSSs. Therefore, in this paper (Part-I), we aim to further explore the pure reactive power potential of WSs (i. e., without BSSs) by investigating the issue of variable <b>reverse</b> <b>power</b> <b>flow</b> under different limits on PFs in an electricity market model.

Advances in photovoltaic (PV) inverters offer new opportunities for reactive power management provided PV owners have the right investment incentives. In this context, reactive power compensation is considered here as an ancillary service. Accounting for the increasing time-variability of distributed generation and demand, a stochastic reactive power compensation scheme is developed. Given uncertain active power injections, an online reactive control scheme is devised. This scheme is distribution-free and relies solely on power injection data. Reactive injections are updated using the Lagrange multipliers of a second-order cone program. Numerical tests on an industrial 47 -bus microgrid and the residential IEEE 123 -bus feeder corroborate the reactive power management efficiency of the novel stochastic scheme over its deterministic alternative, {{as well as its}} capability to track variations in solar generation and household demand.
