5000|$|Upon release, Bubblegum Slut said: [...] "Therapy is an {{appropriately}} named, open-hearted, on-the-couch {{record from}} a man whose public persona has always been rather one dimensional. As a result {{there seems to be}} something of a watershed here; different styles and ideas are crammed in hectically and most songs feature some candid emotional outpouring. Therapy is a record which raises a lot of issues for its author - listen only if you're prepared for some seriously thought provoking pop." [...] The Last Word described the album as a [...] "fantastic solo record" [...] and commented: [...] "Of all the things I didn't expect to enjoy this year, a solo album by the guy who used to play bass in Slade was <b>right</b> up <b>there</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top. It's been 16 years since Lea's last album but on this evidence he's kept up with both pop and rock. Especially if it's the sort of pop and rock that owes its very existence to Slade. A truly surprising pleasure." [...] Robin Dart of Subba-Cultcha said: [...] "Wonderfully crafted songs, it is an album in the true sense. On Therapy, James Whild Lea showcases his song-writing ability, by penning the kind of songs which are quite simply really well written. In a world of mediocre songwriters pushing albums on more style than substance this record harks back to the Paul McCartneys of song-writing, welding effective melodies to imaginative arrangements, and it is quite simply a joy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Quoting Dawkins' {{description}} of the Old Testament God as [...] "a petty, unjust ... capriciously malevolent bully", McGrath counters {{that he does not}} believe in such a god and knows no one personally who does. Setting aside Dawkins' remarks, McGrath instead points to Jesus and the New Testament as superior examples of the true nature of Christianity. [...] "Jesus", McGrath argues, [...] "...was the object, not the agent, of violence". McGrath suggests that [...] "far from endorsing 'out-group hostility', Jesus commanded an ethic of 'out-group affirmation' and Christians may certainly be accused of failing to live up to this command. But it is <b>there,</b> <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> heart of the Christian ethic". He believes that Dawkins is right when he argues {{that it is necessary to}} critique religion, and right to demand that there be an external criterion for interpreting texts; but argues that Dawkins appears unaware that religions and their texts possess internal means of reform and renewal, and that Dawkins seems unaware of the symbolism of several of the Bible passages which he quotes. McGrath cites the works of numerous authors, including Kenneth I. Pargament, Harold G. Koenig, and Terry Eagleton, to demonstrate how closely he feels religious faith to be tied to well-being.|$|R
5000|$|The Italian {{manuscript}} has 506 pages, {{of which}} the Gospel of Barnabas fills pages 43 to 500, written within red frames in an Islamic style. The preceding pages five to forty-two are also red framed; but remain blank (other than for Cramer's presentation to Prince Eugene), {{and it may be}} inferred that some sort of preface or preliminary text was intended, although the space is much greater than would have been needed for the text of the corresponding Spanish Preface. There are chapter rubrics and margin notes in ungrammatical Arabic; with an occasional Turkish word, and many Turkish syntactical features. Its binding is Turkish, and appears to be original; but the paper has an Italian watermark, which has been dated between 1563 and 1620. The same scribe wrote both the Italian text and the Arabic notes, and was clearly [...] "occidental" [...] in being accustomed to write from left to <b>right.</b> <b>There</b> are catchwords <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom of each page, a practice common in manuscripts intended to be set up for printing. The manuscript appears to be unfinished, in that the Prologue and 222 chapters are provided throughout with framed blank spaces for titular headings, but only 28 of these spaces have been filled. This Italian manuscript formed the basis for the most commonly circulated English version, a translation undertaken by Lonsdale and Laura Ragg and published in 1907. The Raggs' English version was quickly re-translated into Arabic by Rashid Rida, in an edition published in Egypt in 1908.|$|R
