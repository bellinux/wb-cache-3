25|$|Many real {{dynamical}} {{systems do}} not exactly fit this model. In fact, unmodelled dynamics can seriously degrade the filter performance, {{even when it}} was supposed to work with unknown stochastic signals as inputs. The {{reason for this is that}} the effect of unmodelled dynamics depends on the input, and, therefore, can bring the estimation algorithm to instability (it diverges). On the other hand, independent white noise signals will not make the algorithm diverge. The problem of distinguishing between measurement noise and unmodelled dynamics is a difficult one and is treated in control theory under the framework of <b>robust</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the literature, {{there are}} two types of MPCs for {{stochastic}} systems; <b>Robust</b> model predictive <b>control</b> and stochastic model predictive control(SMPC). <b>Robust</b> model predictive <b>control</b> is a more conservative method which considers the worst scenario in the optimization procedure. However, this method, similar to other <b>robust</b> <b>controls,</b> deteriorates the overall controller's performance and also is applicable only for systems with bounded uncertainties. The alternative method, SMPC, considers soft constraints which limit the risk of violation by a probabilistic inequality.|$|R
