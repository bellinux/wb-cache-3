Escherichia coli relA encodes a ppGpp synthetase, and although the regulation of RelA protein activity has been studied extensively, the regulation of relA transcription remains unclear.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To study {{significant}} surgical complications requiring early (< or = 3 months posttransplant) relaparotomy (<b>relap)</b> after pancreas transplants, and {{to develop}} clinically relevant surgical and peritransplant decision-making guidelines for preventing and managing such complications. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Pancreas grafts are still associated with the highest surgical complication rate of all routinely transplanted solid organs. However, the impact of surgical complications on morbidity, hospital costs, and graft and patient survival rates has not been analyzed in detail to date. METHODS: We retrospectively studied surgical complications requiring <b>relap</b> in 441 consecutive cadaver, bladder-drained pancreas transplants (54 % simultaneous pancreas and kidney [SPK]; 22 % pancreas after kidney [PAK]; 24 % pancreas transplant alone [PTA]; 37 % retransplant). Outcome and hospital charges were analyzed separately for recipients with versus without reoperation. RESULTS: The overall <b>relap</b> rate was 32 % (SPK, 36 %; PAK, 25 %; PTA, 16 %; p = 0. 04). The most common causes were intraabdominal infection and graft pancreatitis (38 %), pancreas graft thrombosis (27 %), and anastomotic leak (15 %). Perioperative <b>relap</b> mortality was 9 %; transplant pancreatectomy was necessary in 57 % of all recipients {{with one or more}} relaps. The pancreas graft was lost in 80 % of recipients with versus 41 % without <b>relap</b> (p < 0. 0001). Patient survival rates were significantly lower (p < 0. 05) for recipients with versus without <b>relap.</b> By multivariate analysis, significant risk factors for graft loss included older donor age (SPK, PAK), retransplant (PAK), <b>relap</b> for infection (SPK, PAK), and <b>relap</b> for leak or bleeding (PAK). For death, risk factors included older recipient age (SPK, PAK),retransplant (SPK, PAK), <b>relap</b> for thrombosis (PAK), <b>relap</b> for infection or leak (SPK), and <b>relap</b> for bleeding (PTA). CONCLUSIONS: Posttransplant surgical complications requiring <b>relap</b> were frequent, resulted in a high rate of pancreas (SPK, PAK, PTA) and kidney (SPK, PAK) graft loss, and had a major economic impact (p = 0. 0001). Complications were associated with substantial perioperative mortality and decreased patient survival rates. The focus must therefore shift from graft salvage to preservation of the recipient's life once a pancreas graft-related complication requiring <b>relap</b> occurs. Thus, the threshold for pancreatectomy should be low. In this context, acceptance of older donors and recipients must be reconsidered...|$|E

However, {{it is very important}} to evaluate these codes by testing different accident scenarios in actual plant conditions. In reactor analysis, small break loss of coolant accident (SBLOCA) is an important safety issue. <b>RELAP</b> 5 -MV Visualized Modularization software is recognized as one of the best estimate transient simulation programs of light water reactors (LWR). <b>RELAP</b> 5 -MV has new options for improved modeling methods and interactive graphics display. Though the same models incorporated in <b>RELAP</b> 5 /MOD 4. 0 are in <b>RELAP</b> 5 -MV, the significant difference of the latter is the interface for preparing the input deck.

Here, we analyze the mechanisms involved in <b>RelAp</b> 43 -M protein interaction. We demonstrate that the central part of M-Tha, and the specific C-terminal region of <b>RelAp</b> 43 are required for this interaction. Four differences in the corresponding amino acid sequences of the M-Tha and M-SAD are shown to be crucial for <b>RelAp</b> 43 interaction and subsequent modulation of innate immune response. Furthermore, the capacity of M-Tha to interact with <b>RelAp</b> 43 was shown to be crucial for the control of the expression of four genes (IFN, TNF, IL 8 and CXCL 2) during viral infection. These findings reveal that <b>RelAp</b> 43 is a potent regulator of transcription of genes involved in innate immune response during rabies virus infection and that the M protein of wild isolates of rabies virus is a viral immune-modulatory factor playing an important role in this <b>RelAp</b> 43 -mediated host innate immunity response in contrast to M protein of vaccine strains, which have lost this property...|$|E

40|$|At the {{crossroad}} {{between the}} NF-κB and the MAPK pathways, the ternary complex composed of p 105, ABIN 2 and TPL 2 {{is essential for}} the host cell response to pathogens. The matrix protein (M) of field isolates of rabies virus was previously shown to disturb the signaling induced by <b>RelAp</b> 43, a NF-κB protein close to RelA/p 65. Here, we investigated how the M protein disturbs the NF-κB pathway in a <b>RelAp</b> 43 -dependant manner and the potential involvement of the ternary complex in this mechanism. Using a tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry approach, we show that <b>RelAp</b> 43 interacts with the p 105 -ABIN 2 -TPL 2 complex and we observe a strong perturbation of this complex in presence of M protein. M protein interaction with <b>RelAp</b> 43 is associated with a wide disturbance of NF-κB signaling, involving a modulation of IκBα-, IκBβ-, and IκBε-RelAp 43 interaction and a favored interaction of <b>RelAp</b> 43 with the non-canonical pathway (RelB and p 100 /p 52). Monitoring the interactions between host and viral proteins using protein-fragment complementation assay and bioluminescent resonance energy transfer, we further show that <b>RelAp</b> 43 is associated to the p 105 -ABIN 2 -TPL 2 complex as <b>RelAp</b> 43 -p 105 interaction stabilizes the formation of a complex with ABIN 2 and TPL 2. Interestingly, the M protein interacts not only with <b>RelAp</b> 43 but also with TPL 2 and ABIN 2. Upon interaction with this complex, M protein promotes the release of ABIN 2, which ultimately favors the production of <b>RelAp</b> 43 -p 50 NF-κB dimers. The use of recombinant rabies viruses further indicates that this mechanism leads to the control of IFNβ, TNF and CXCL 2 expression during the infection and a high pathogenicity profile in rabies virus infected mice. All together, our results demonstrate the important role of <b>RelAp</b> 43 and M protein in the regulation of NF-κB signaling...|$|E
