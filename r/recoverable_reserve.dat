5000|$|Peak {{production}} of the field had been reached by 1918, before the street grid for Baytown had even been drawn up.

5000|$|The {{idea that}} the rate of oil {{production}} would peak and irreversibly decline is an old one. In 1919, David White, chief geologist of the United States Geological Survey, wrote of US petroleum: [...] "... the peak of production will soon be passed, possibly within 3 years." [...] In 1953, Eugene Ayers, a researcher for Gulf Oil, projected that if US ultimate recoverable oil reserves were 100 billion barrels, then production in the US would peak no later than 1960. If ultimate recoverable were to be as high as 200 billion barrels, which he warned was wishful thinking, US peak production would come no later than 1970. Likewise for the world, he projected a peak somewhere between 1985 (one trillion barrels ultimate recoverable) and 2000 (two trillion barrels recoverable). Ayers made his projections without a mathematical model. He wrote: [...] "But if the curve is made to look reasonable, it is quite possible to adapt mathematical expressions to it and to determine, in this way, the peak dates corresponding to various ultimate <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> numbers" ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> estimation, either {{globally}} or locally, {{has become}} a standard geostatistical application in the mining industry. Early {{in the analysis of}} the <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> problem, in the 1970 's, both the support effect and the information effect were identified as playing a potentially important role in the final result. To date however only the support effect has been implemented to any significant extent. The information effect refers to the fact that, even during production, the real mining block grades are not known. Only an estimated value of them, based on production samples, is known and pay blocks are defined according to whether this value, not the real grade, is above the economic cut-off. So some pay blocks will be misclassified as waste and visa versa. This information effect, that quantifies the amount and the effect of the misclassification on the <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> {{must be taken into account}} to obtain a more realistic <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> estimate. In this paper we show how the estimation of the global <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> and of the local reserves by uniform conditioning can be adapted to take the information effect into account. The multi-gaussian framework means that the distribution of both the real and estimated block grades can be modelled and incorporated into the estimation. The proposed technique will be applied to a case study based on a large Australian open-pit gold mine...|$|R
5000|$|As of 2013 the Cline Shale, also {{referred}} to as the [...] "Wolfcamp/Cline Shale", the [...] "Lower Wolfcamp Shale,", or the [...] "Spraberry-Wolfcamp shale", or even the [...] "Wolfberry", is a promising Pennsylvanian oil play east of Midland, Texas which underlies 10 counties: Fisher, Nolan, Sterling, Coke, Glasscock, Tom Green, Howard, Mitchell, Borden and Scurry County, Texas. Exploitation is projected to rely on hydraulic fracturing.an organic rich shale, with Total Organic Content (TOC) of 1-8%, with silt and sand beds mixed in. It lies in a broad shelf, with minimal relief and has nice light oil of 38-42 gravity with excellent porosity of 6-12% in thickness varying 200 to 550 feet thick. The total recovery was estimated to 30 billion barrels in 2012, and United States Geological Survey estimated the technically <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> to 20 billion barrels in 2016, the largest USGS estimate ever and nearly three times larger than that of the 2013 USGS Bakken-Three Forks resource assessment in North Dakota. The field also seems to contain 16 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. This is the first assessment of continuous resources in the Wolfcamp shale in the Midland Basin portion of the Permian. During the 1980s, vertical wells produced oil in the Wolfcamp area. However, since 2000 in North America, horizontal drilling or porpoising along with hydraulic fracturing have grown tremendously and are tapping the continuous oil reserve.

40|$|Recoverable {{reserves}} are {{that portion of}} a mineral deposit that has been delineated by a mine plan to be economically minable. At time of prediction, recoverable {{reserves are}} estimated based on limited sampling information usually of a high quality into large panels. Subsequent to this, {{at the time of}} mining, additional information usually of a poorer quality is available allowing estimation into smaller blocks which are used in ultimate block selection. As <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> estimation is interested in the prediction of tonnages and grades that will be recovered at the time of mining, the main concern of <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> estimation is the imprecise selection of ore/waste {{as a result of the}} information and support effect. For the selection of a block as ore or waste during mining, a cut-off is usually considered where a block is considered as ore if its grade is greater than the cut-off or waste, if it falls below the cut-off. For perfect selection a cut-off needs to be applied to the real block grades however, as the real block grades are never known, more typically actual selection is employed where a cut-off is applied to the estimated block grades. In this case, the misclassification of blocks as ore or waste can take place as a result of information and support effect resulting in the incorrect selection of blocks. Block selection is at its best at this stage; prior to this during <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> estimation the potential for misclassification of blocks is far worse due to the reduced data densities existing with exploration drilling and difference in data quality between grade control and exploration sampling. Both of these factors impact on the information and support effect and therefore the ability to accurately select the correct blocks are ore or waste. In reconciling a mine plan it is important to make a distinction between deviations as a result of unpredictable dilution factors caused by mining and geotechnical factors and those factors such as the support and information effect that are predictable. We therefore assume free selection of the selective mining unit (SMU) where access and mining constraints are not taken into account. The widespread use of simulation for <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> estimation within the mining industry has been limited in the past due to limitations of computational speed and efficiency. This study demonstrates successfully a practical application for the simulating of recoverable reserves directly into SMUs using a direct block simulation method to overcome these problems. In this thesis, the methodology is demonstrated on the Morila gold deposit, which consists of a geologically defined ore zone within a low grade host rock. Here, the direct block simulation methodology is demonstrated in a production environment and assessed in terms of whether the technique would find general acceptance in the mining industry. The direct block simulation results where contrasted in this thesis to a uniform conditioning estimate demonstrating firstly that the direct block simulation approach is as accurate and as efficient as existing <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> estimation techniques utilized in the industry. Secondly, that the direct block simulation is a practical alternative to traditional <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> methods. Finally, that direct block simulation added value by providing additional information not provided by traditional <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> techniques through a measure of the uncertainty in the recoverable reserves and the incorporation of the information effect. The calculation of recoverable reserves in this study, involved the calculation of an error density map which was added to the individual realisations of the direct block simulation to provide an uncertainty assessment of the recoverable reserves within the deposit, while accounting for the differences in support and information effect between the exploration and blasthole sampling information. The application of the method at Morila utilized known block selection information from mined out area to adjust the estimates to known statistical distributions. Finally, the realisations generated where shown to be comparable to the block selection determined in the mined out areas using the grade control drilling. Recognising the effect of information and support and quantifying and managing its potential impact when planning a mine operation can have a large influence in a projects feasibility and final economic outcome. This thesis demonstrates a possible methodology for accounting for the expected inaccuracies in the selection of ore and waste block by incorporating the effect of future, as yet unavailable data, into the <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> estimates. In this way, the effect of support and information effect on the final estimates of recoverable reserves can be mitigated and fully informed mining decision can be made...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Recoverable {{reserves}} ar {{defined as}} the tonnage and grade that can be recovered above a given cut-off grade in a selective mining operation. Their estimation depends on three factors: the support, information and constraint effects. These factors are discussed, and some traditional methods for estimation f global and local recoverable reserves ar reviewed. The technique of conditional simulation is proposed as a practical alternative {{to some of the}} more complex methods currently used. The broad concepts of conditional simulation are discussed, and some alternative simulation methods presented. A case study on a set of real mining data illustrates the use of the conditional simulation approach to <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> estimation, with the support and information effects being modelled very simply. Results are compared with e discrete gaussian model, and with ordinary kriging, which is shown to be unsuitable for <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> estimation.
