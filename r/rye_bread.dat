40|$|Rye {{products}} typically induce low insulin {{responses and}} appear to facilitate glucose regulation. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate differences in postprandial glucose, insulin, and satiety responses between breads made from five <b>rye</b> varieties. <b>Breads</b> made from whole grain rye (Amilo, Rekrut, Dankowski Zlote, Nikita, and Haute Loire Pop) or a white wheat bread (WWB) were tested in a randomized cross-over design in 14 healthy subjects (50 g available starch). Metabolic responses were also related to the composition of dietary fiber and bioactive compounds in the breads and to the rate of in vitro starch hydrolysis. The Amilo and Rekrut <b>rye</b> <b>breads</b> induced significantly lower insulin indices (II) than WWB. Low early postprandial glucose and insulin responses (tAUC 0 - 60 min) were related to higher amounts of caffeic, ferulic, sinapic, and vanillic acids in the <b>rye</b> <b>breads,</b> indicating that the phenolic acids in rye may influence glycemic regulation. All <b>rye</b> <b>breads</b> induced significantly higher subjective feelings of fullness compared to WWB. A low II was related to a higher feeling of fullness and a lower desire to eat in the late postprandial phase (180 min). The data indicate that some rye varieties may be more insulin-saving than others, possibly due to differences in dietary fiber, rate of starch hydrolysis, and bioactive components such as phenolic acids...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Disintegration of <b>rye</b> {{and wheat}} <b>breads</b> during in vitro gastric {{digestion}} {{and its relation}} to the postprandial glucose and insulin responses of the breads was studied. Breads with distinct composition and texture characteristics were prepared with refined or wholegrain wheat and rye flour by using either straight dough or sourdough process. After chewing and gastric digestion in vitro, 100 % wholemeal and refined <b>rye</b> <b>breads</b> prepared by sourdough method were disintegrated to a much lower extent than the wheat breads, having more bread digesta particles with size over 2 or 3 mm. Microstructure of the digesta particles of <b>rye</b> sourdough <b>bread</b> revealed more aggregated and less degraded starch granules when compared to refined wheat bread. The postprandial insulin responses, but not those of glucose, to the 100 % <b>rye</b> <b>breads</b> made with sourdough method were lower than the responses to the refined wheat bread. Addition of gluten or bran in <b>rye</b> sourdough <b>bread</b> increased insulin response. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) analysis confirmed that the insulin response had a negative correlation with the number of larger particles after in vitro digestion as well as amount of soluble fiber and sourdough process. Since the high relative proportion of large sized particles after chewing and in vitro gastric digestion was associated with low postprandial insulin responses, the analysis of structural disintegration in vitro is proposed as a complementary tool i...|$|R

50|$|It was {{not until}} the 18th century that it became common {{practice}} to make leavened <b>rye</b> <b>breads.</b> Sour dough was mostly used (older rye dough which had started to ferment). These breads were called pottbrauð (pot breads) because they were baked (or rather steamed) on a stove under a pot (upside down) - i.e. a kind of oven. Around 1900, it was common to bake these breads in sealed containers (i.e. from imported sweets, today often from milk cartons). When ovens became a household item, the containers were placed in them. Where thermal springs were available nearby, they were (and still are) used to bake these dark, moist and rather sweet breads (taking up to 24 hours). <b>Rye</b> <b>breads</b> baked in hot springs are a popular item today, being served for local consumption as well as for tourists.|$|R

Postprandial glucose and insulin were measured at 0 - 230 min. Breads were chemically characterized including macronutrients, energy, dietary fiber components, and amino acid composition, and microstructure was characterized with light microscopy. Reported fullness was 16 % higher (P< 0. 001), and hunger 11 % and 12 % lower (P< 0. 05) after ingestion of uRCB and RCB, respectively, compared with WCB. Postprandial glucose response did not differ significantly between treatments. Postprandial insulin was 10 % lower (P< 0. 007) between 0 - 120 min but not significantly lower between 0 - 230 min for RCB compared with WCB. uRCB induced 13 % (P< 0. 002) and 17 % (P< 0. 001) lower postprandial insulin response between 0 - 230 min compared with RCB and WCB respectively.

25|$|Breakfast usually {{consists}} of pancakes, cereal, fruit, and coffee, while lunch {{may take the}} form of a smörgåsbord. The main meal of the day for most Icelanders is dinner, which usually involves fish or lamb as the main course. Seafood is central to most Icelandic cooking, particularly cod and haddock but also salmon, herring, and halibut. It is often prepared in a wide variety of ways, either smoked, pickled, boiled, or dried. Lamb is by far the most common meat, and it tends to be either smoke-cured (known as hangikjöt) or salt-preserved (saltkjöt). Many older dishes make use of every part of the sheep, such as slátur, which {{consists of}} offal (internal organs and entrails) minced together with blood and served in sheep stomach.

25|$|The {{regulations}} {{that came into}} force on 1 January 2000 regarding the sale of loose goods effectively made it mandatory to use metric units in the retail industry for most products though supplementary indicators using certain imperial units were still permitted under United Kingdom law. Various price-marking orders prescribed the sizes in which products could be marketed. Some of these restrictions, such as wine being sold in 750ml bottles, were derived from EU directives, while others, such as the production of bread in 400g or 800g loaves, were applicable to the United Kingdom only. The principle of the Internal Market, backed up by a judgment of the European Court of Justice, required that any product that was legally produced anywhere in the European Union could, in most cases, be sold anywhere in the EU. Thus a 500g packet of <b>rye</b> <b>bread,</b> legally manufactured in Germany, could be sold in the United Kingdom {{even though it was}} not lawful under British law for a British baker to produce an identical 500g packet of bread.|$|E

40|$|Whole-grain (WG) foods rich in indigestible {{carbohydrates}} {{are thought}} to modulate {{the composition of the}} intestinal microbiota. We investigated in a randomized, parallel, 2 -arm 12 -wk intervention whether consumption of WG and fiber-rich <b>rye</b> <b>breads</b> compared with refined wheat breads affected the microbiota composition in Finnish individuals aged 60 ± 6 y with metabolic syndrome. Fecal samples from 51 participants (25 males, 26 females) before and after the intervention were processed for the microbiota analysis using a phylogenetic microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reactions targeting the 16 S rRNA gene. The intake of whole grains calculated from food records was higher in the group consuming <b>rye</b> <b>breads</b> (75 g) than in that consuming refined wheat breads (4 g; P < 0. 001), confirmed by fasting plasma alkylrecorsinol concentrations, a biomarker of whole grain intake. The intestinal microbiota composition did not significantly differ between the groups after the intervention. However, we detected a 37 % decrease of Bacteroidetes (P < 0. 05) in parallel to a 53 % decrease in the alkylrecorsinol concentration (P < 0. 001) in the group consuming refined wheat breads. In this group, the abundance of bacteria related to Bacteroides vulgatus, B. plebeius, and Prevotella tannerae decreased, whereas that of bacteria related to Collinsella and members of the Clostridium clusters IV and XI increased. In a multivariate regression analysis, the abundance of Bacteroides spp. was best explained by different fat compounds among dietary variables, whereas the main sugar-converting butyrate-producers were mostly associated with the intake of whole- and refined-grain bread and fiber. Our results indicate that the quality of grains has a minor effect on the intestinal microbiota composition in participants with metabolic syndrome and suggest that the dietary influence on the microbiota involves other dietary components such as fa...|$|R

500|$|The {{dominant}} tastes in borscht are {{sweet and}} sour. This combination is traditionally obtained by adding beet sour. It {{is made by}} covering sliced beetroots with lukewarm preboiled water and allowing bacteria to ferment some of the sugars present in beetroots into dextran (which gives the liquid a slightly viscous consistency), mannitol, acetic acid and lactic acid. Stale <b>rye</b> <b>bread</b> is often added to hasten the process, but usually omitted in Jewish recipes, as chametz (leavened bread) would make the sour unfit for Passover meals. Sugar, salt and lemon juice may be also added to balance the flavor. After about 2–5 days (or 2–3 weeks without the bread), the deep red, sweet and sour liquid may be strained and is ready to use. It is added to borscht shortly before the soup is done, as prolonged boiling would cause the tart flavor to dissipate. The beet sour is known in Slavic languages as kvas (literally 'sour, acid'; compare kvass) and in Yiddish as [...] (from a Slavic word originally referring to any brine obtained by steeping salted meat or vegetables in water; compare Russian [...] 'pickle juice', Polish [...] 'broth'). Apart from its employment in borscht, it may be also added to prepared horseradish or used as pot roast marinade.|$|E
