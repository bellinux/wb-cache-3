40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an idea for}} offering Internet access through dialup by using dynamic user profiles that depend on the available resources of an ISP. This service allows an ISP to offer scalable access services according to network utilization and availability of user connection ports. This idea may be offered over PSTN and ISDN, but with ISDN as the most suitable candidate, due to the inherent ability of using 2 channels over the same wire. It {{is based on the}} use of existing technology and protocols, as well as the commonly adopted infrastructure for AAA (Authentication Authorization and Accounting), based on a RADIUS (<b>Remote</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Dial</b> In Users) server. Therefore, it introduces a new type of user subscription that may be easily implemented and which can make use of the available ISP resources at the best and most efficient way without compromising the ISP network accessibility and without any major cost for an ISP...|$|R

40|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{designing}} a learning center to fit the instructional programs of Gallaudet College, {{a review of the}} literature and visits to 20 schools and colleges were made and options considered for the provision of nonprint materials. The costs, advantages, and utility of various nonprint retrieval systems are analyzed, specifically videocassette systems, television, and <b>dial</b> <b>access</b> equipment. Library functions necessary in the support of a nonprint collection are defined, including selection of materials, with emphasis on faculty participation; organization and housing of the collection; personnel; dissemination; outreach to students and faculty; and evaluation. Recommendations are then made, in the form of performance objectives through 1980, for the development of the nonprint retrieval services at Gallaudet College Library. Cost estimates are provided for achieving these objectives. Because the provision of such a learning center has implications for the total program of the college, suggestions are made for increased coordination between the library and students, faculty and administration.

50|$|<b>Remote</b> Authentication <b>Dial</b> In User Service (RADIUS) is an AAA (authentication, {{authorization}} and accounting) protocol {{used for}} remote network access. RADIUS was originally proprietary but was later published under ISOC documents RFC 2138 and RFC 2139. The {{idea is to}} have an inside server act as a gatekeeper by verifying identities through a username and password that is already pre-determined by the user. A RADIUS server can also be configured to enforce user policies and restrictions as well as record accounting information such as connection time for purposes such as billing.|$|R

40|$|Tunable single-frequency {{sources in}} the 2 - 4 micron {{wavelength}} region are useful for <b>remote</b> <b>DIAL</b> measurements of chemicals and pollutants. We are developing tunable single-frequency transmitters and receivers for both direct and coherent detection lidar measurement applications. We have demonstrated a direct-diode-pumped PPLN-based OPO that operates single frequency, produces greater than 10 mW cw and is tunable over the 2. 5 - 3. 9 micron wavelength region. This laser {{has been used to}} injection seed a pulsed PPLN OPO, pumped by a 1. 064 micron Nd:YAG laser, producing 50 - 100 microJoule single-frequency pulses at 100 Hz PRF near 3. 6 micron wavelength. In addition, we have demonstrated a cw Cr:ZnSe laser that is tunable over the 2. 1 - 2. 8 micron wavelength region. This laser is pumped by a cw diode-pumped Tm:YALO laser and has produced over 1. 8 W cw. Tm- and Tm, Ho-doped single-frequency solid-state lasers that produce over 50 mW cw and are tunable over approximately 10 nm in the 2 - 2. 1 micron band with fast PZT tuning have also been demonstrated. A fast PZT-tunable Tm, Ho:YLF laser was used for a direct-detection column content DIAL measurement of atmospheric CO 2. Modeling shows that that all these cw and pulsed sources are useful for column-content coherent DIAL measurements at several km range using topographic targets...|$|R
