40|$|The {{focus of}} the paper {{consists}} in reconstructing woman's image preserved in Sephardic proverbs.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} how to measure welfare effect of the deregulation and increased competition of the public transport by railway in Sweden. The paper also includes a numerical example of how to measure the welfare effect. In our study we use public data from SJ <b>regaring</b> quantity and ticket prices for the period 1996 - 2005. We have used equivalent variation, EV, as the method to measure the welfare effect. We demonstrate how to derive the equation to calculate EV by starting with a Marschallian demand function. As the alternative price path we use the Swedish producers’ price index, PPI. The result of the measurement is that the increased competition in Sweden has had a positive effect on welfare. Since the data is limited, the monetary value of the welfare effect presented in this paper should be interpreted with caution and evaluated further with a more enlarged set of data...|$|R
