5|$|In Antananarivo and {{throughout}} the highlands, Merina and Betsileo families practice the famadihana, an ancestor reburial ceremony. This ceremony typically occurs {{five to seven years}} after the death of a relative and is celebrated by removing the relative's lamba-wrapped remains from the family tomb, rewrapping it with fresh silk shrouds and returning it to the tomb. <b>Relatives,</b> <b>friends</b> and neighbors are invited {{to take part in the}} music, dancing and feasting that accompanies the event. The famadihana is costly; many families sacrifice higher living standards to set aside money for the ceremony.|$|E

40|$|To enable <b>relatives</b> and <b>friends</b> of {{psychiatric}} {{patients in a}} 30 -bed acute admission ward to meet the staff team together a <b>relatives</b> and <b>friends</b> group was initiated. The group was intended to provide a forum for questions about the patients' illness and treatment; allow feelings, such as anger and anxiety, about the patient's illness to be expressed; and enable <b>relatives</b> and <b>friends</b> to share their experiences and offer advice and support to each other. A {{study was designed to}} assess the feasibility of the group scheme. <b>Relatives</b> and <b>friends</b> were invited to the day room of the admission ward each Wednesday evening for one hour. The visitors chose their own topics for discussion and the staff team tried to answer questions and to facilitate a free exchange of views. An account of each meeting was documented, including details of attenders, the nature of the topics raised, and a simple measurement of some of the emotions expressed by the visitors. Overall, the effect of the meetings seemed positive and productive, for they allowed <b>relatives</b> and <b>friends</b> to ask questions about many topics, to express pent-up emotions, and {{to gain a better understanding}} and tolerance of the patient's illness. The <b>relatives</b> and <b>friends</b> group has become an integral part of treatment on the wards.

30|$|From the {{perspective}} of financing cost, financing the start-up and running of an enterprise through loans from <b>relatives</b> and <b>friends</b> certainly costs the least. However, guaranteed by these so-called strong ties, 12 the amount of financing is seriously limited by the relations because loans from <b>relatives</b> or <b>friends</b> {{and the expansion of}} these relations in order to start and run a business are either far from enough to meet the need or costs more with the expansion of relations. What is more, in daily production and management, constantly borrowing money from <b>relatives</b> and <b>friends</b> due to capital shortage harms trusted relationships because it signifies bad management and loss of money. For the sake of avoiding risk, most <b>relatives</b> and <b>friends</b> are unwilling to lend money. As a result, these loans are very limited and astringent with the social relations expanding gradually and the cost increasing.|$|R

500|$|Mathew Charles Lamb {{was born}} in Windsor, Ontario on 5 January 1948, {{the only child of}} a 15-year-old mother who {{abandoned}} him soon after birth. Raised by an assortment of grandparents, aunts and uncles, he rarely saw his mother while growing up and never knew his father, who died in the United States while Lamb was young. Lamb spent most of his childhood with his maternal grandmother and her new husband Christopher Collins at their home on York Street in the South Central neighbourhood of Windsor, where his presence was resented by the step-grandfather Collins. According to interviews with <b>relatives,</b> <b>friends</b> and neighbours conducted by Lamb's legal counsel Saul Nosanchuk in the mid-1960s, Collins subjected the boy to sustained emotional and physical abuse, beating him and frequently calling him a [...] "little [...] ".

500|$|Scion of New England clergy, Stowe keenly felt a {{sense of}} Christian {{responsibility}} that was expressed in her letters.

Stowe described the charm of the region and its generally moderate climate but warned readers of [...] "excessive" [...] heat in the summer months and occasional cold snaps in winter.

500|$|National unity crumbled {{under the}} weight of a {{continuous}} round of civil wars, rebellions and coups. The Unitarian–Federalist struggle brought perennial instability while caudillos fought for power and laid waste to the countryside. By 1826, Rosas had built a power base, consisting of <b>relatives,</b> <b>friends</b> and clients, and joined the Federalist Party. He remained a strong [...] advocate of his native province of Buenos Aires, with little concern for political ideology. In 1820, Rosas fought alongside the Unitarians because he saw the Federalist invasion as a menace to Buenos Aires. When the Unitarians sought to appease the Federalists by proposing to grant the other provinces a share in the customs revenues flowing through Buenos Aires, Rosas saw this as a threat to his province's interests. In 1827, four provinces led by Federalist caudillos rebelled against the Unitarian government. Rosas was {{the driving force behind the}} Federalist takeover of Buenos Aires and the election of Manuel Dorrego as provincial governor that year. Rosas was awarded with the post of general commander of the rural militias of the province of Buenos Aires on 14 July, which increased his influence and power.|$|E
500|$|Chancellor Wang Anshi, also {{a renowned}} prose stylist, wrote a work {{on matters of}} state justice in the 11th century. Wang wrote that private interests, {{especially}} of those seeking vigilante justice, should in almost all circumstances never trump or interfere with public justice. In the ancient Classic of Rites, Rites of Zhou, and [...] "Gongyang" [...] commentary of the Spring and Autumn Annals, seeking vengeance for a violent crime against one's family {{is viewed as a}} moral and filial obligation, although in the Rites of Zhou state intervention between the instigating and avenging parties was emphasized. Wang believed that the state of Song China was far more stable than those in ancient times and abler to dispense fair justice. Although Wang praised the classic avenger Wu Zixu (526–484 BC), Michael Dalby writes that Wang [...] "would have been filled with horror if Wu's deeds, so outdated in their political implications, had been repeated in Song times." [...] For Wang, a victim exacting personal revenge against one who committed an egregious criminal act should only be considered acceptable when the government and its legal system became dysfunctional, chaotic, or ceased to exist. In his view, the hallmark of a properly functioning government was one where an innocent man was never executed. If this were to occur, his or her grieving <b>relatives,</b> <b>friends,</b> and associates should voice complaints to officials of ever increasing hierarchic status until grievances were properly addressed. If such a case reached the emperor—the last and final judge—and he decided that previous officials who heard the case had erred in their decisions, he would accordingly punish those officials and the original guilty party. If even the emperor for some reason made a fault in pardoning a party which was truly guilty, then Wang reasoned that the only explanation for a lack of justice was the will of heaven and its judgment which was beyond the control of mortal men. Wang insisted that submitting to the will of heaven in this regard {{was the right thing to}} do, while a murdered father or mother could still be honored through ritual sacrifices.|$|E
500|$|Forman and {{his colleagues}} were {{committed}} to the strategy of casting non-professionals and utilizing dialogue improvisation whenever possible. Most of the actors were chosen from among <b>relatives,</b> <b>friends</b> and acquaintances of Forman and his crew, {{to the point where}} Forman was later to liken the atmosphere to making a [...] "home movie". For the title role, Forman selected his 18-year-old ex-sister-in-law, Hana Brejchová, not because, as was rumored at the time, he wanted revenge on his ex-wife, movie-star Jana Brejchová, but because he had known Hana a long time, trusted her, and had great respect for her natural talents: [...] "She had an amazing ability of free expression, but with the risk that she didn’t recognize the extent. However, Vlada Pucholt [...] held her firmly in the rhythm of the scene, in a professional position.” The character of Milda's father was played by the uncle of Forman's cameraman, and Milda's mother was played by a factory lathe operator whom Passer and Papoušek had met on a streetcar, and who struck them as someone who [...] "seemed so interested in things around her, no matter how silly". The factory supervisor was played by the actual public relations manager of the factory at Zruč nad Sázavou, where location shooting took place. For the main trio of reservists, Forman wanted to use non-professionals, including the writer Josef Škvorecký, but found that, while the three men did well improvising together whenever they appeared in pairs, they lost their rhythm when all three were included in the same shot. So Forman went to Škvorecký and told the writer that he looked too intelligent to play his role and replaced him with the professional actor Vladimir Mensik. [...] In Škvorecký's words: [...] "To tell someone that he is too intelligent to be an actor is a very nice way of letting him know that he should stay with screen-play writing. [...] Milos is a very considerate person. The fact that he so gently threw me out made possible the greatest scene of Loves of a Blonde". Forman was later to justify his decision to add a professional: [...] "While nonactors keep the actors honest and real, the actors give the scene the rhythm and shape that the nonactors don't feel. A nonactor inhabits the situation so completely that he or she isn't able to view it from the outside, to perceive it as a rhythmic whole with its punctuation and its larger dramatic purpose. Nonactors are perfectly content to repeat themselves and ramble on, so an actor can pull them through the dramatic arch of the scene and draw out the emotional contours of the situation." ...|$|E
