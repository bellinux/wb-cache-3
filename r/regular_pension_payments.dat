Currently, this {{is equal to}} 25% of the earnings on which CPP contributions were made over the entire working life of a contributor from age 18 to 65 in constant dollars.

50|$|The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) {{forms the}} basic state pension system. All those {{employed}} aged 18 or older must contribute {{a portion of}} their income to a pension plan. In all provinces and territories except Quebec, these plans are administered by Employment and Social Development Canada, while Quebec administers them separately with the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP). Upon retiring, a contributor receives <b>regular</b> CPP <b>pension</b> <b>payments</b> equal to 25% of the earnings on which CPP contributions were made over the entire working life of a contributor from age 18 in constant dollars. Adjustments are made according to the Consumer Price Index. Although one can claim a CPP pension at age 60 rather than the typical retirement age of 65, as of 2016, those who claim it at 60 have their pension reduced by 36%.|$|R
