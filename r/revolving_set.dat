John Houseman had secured a partnership with the prestigious Theatre Guild to produce the play for , with an initial tour of Baltimore, Boston, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia before debuting on Broadway. Welles's intended to stage only {{the first part of the}} playwhich was primarily taken from Henry IV Parts 1 and 2 and Henry Vduring the tour while simultaneously rehearsing Part Two and finally debuting the full production on Broadway. Houseman stated that the play's aim was [...] "to combine the immediate quality of the Elizabethan with all the devices and techniques possible in the modern theatre." [...] The cast included Welles as Falstaff, Burgess Meredith as Prince Hal, John Emery as Hotspur, Morris Ankrum as Henry IV and Robert Speaight as the Narrator. The play's music was composed by Aaron Copland. Welles commissioned an elaborate <b>revolving</b> <b>set</b> to be built, but it was not completed during the five weeks allotted to rehearsals.|$|E

500|$|Welles avoided {{attending}} the rehearsals or finishing the play's final script and instead often went out drinking and socializing with co-star Meredith, {{with the result}} that only specific scenes or fragments of the play were ever rehearsed. The Baltimore performance was eventually dropped and at the first dress rehearsal in Boston, it was discovered that the play was over five and a half hours long and contained 46 scenes. Welles cut 14 scenes and shortened others, which caused the built-in timer for the <b>revolving</b> <b>set</b> to move out of synchronization. Five Kings, Part 1 premiered at the Colonial Theatre in Boston on February 27, 1939, and was a disaster. Critics were either scathing or apologetic, and only the play's battle scenes received praise. By the end of the Boston run, the Theatre Guild {{was on the verge of}} dropping the production, and canceled the D.C. engagement. Welles then edited the show to three and a half hours. The play closed after only a few performances in Philadelphia, and the Theatre Guild terminated its contract with the Mercury Theater. Photographs of the play's rehearsals show similarities to Chimes at Midnight, including the Boar's Head Tavern set and the character blocking of the [...] "chimes at midnight" [...] scene with Falstaff, Shallow and Silence.|$|E

2500|$|John Barton's 1960 Shakespeare Memorial Theatre production, {{starring}} Peggy Ashcroft and Peter O'Toole, with Jack MacGowran as Sly. This production highlighted meta-theatricality {{by using}} a <b>revolving</b> <b>set,</b> which occasionally gave the audience glimpses of the actors backstage, changing costumes and consulting scripts. Barton's production included an Induction featuring material from both A Shrew and The Shrew, {{as well as the}} epilogue from A Shrew, and additional material for Sly written by Barton himself. For example, when Vincentio is about to be arrested, Sly ran onstage in disgust and had to be dragged away. This 'unexpected' disruption left the performers stunned, and the actors required prompting so as to continue with the performance. The production was seen by many critics as politically very conservative, with Katherina's final speech delivered sincerely. The Evening Standard called it [...] "a complete and uncompromising anti-feminist version [...] women's suffrage suffers a considerable beating in the completeness of Katherina's capitulation." [...] In a controversial review, Kenneth Tynan wrote Ashcroft delivered the final speech [...] "with an eager, sensible radiance that almost prompts one to regret the triumph of the suffragette movement." [...] Controversy also encapsulated the fact that Ashcroft was twenty-five years older than O'Toole, and that O'Toole had a reputation in real life for being a hell-raiser not entirely dissimilar to Petruchio. Nevertheless, it was a huge financial success.|$|E
