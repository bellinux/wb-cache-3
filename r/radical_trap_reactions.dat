40|$|The research, to be {{presented}} in two chapters discusses {{the development of new}} methods in asymmetric synthesis which may be applicable to the total synthesis of natural products. Chapter 1. We have developed the methodology to functionalize heterocycles such as tetrahydropyran and tetrahydrofuran using intermolecular diastereoselective <b>radical</b> <b>trapping</b> <b>reactions.</b> This method was also extended to prepare bicyclic acetals with three chiral centers using intramolecular radical reactions. The stereocontrol in both intermolecular and intramolecular reactions was studied. This methodology may be developed further to synthesize deoxygenated and substituted carbohydrates. Chapter 2. The highly functionalized eight membered carbocycle is the basic structural unit of many natural products of biological interest. The methodology developed and presented in this chapter utilizes chiral cyclopropyl ketals of eight member carbocycle and introduces functionalities on the eight membered ring with good stereocontrol. This methodology has direct application in the synthesis of many natural products containing functionalized eight member carbocycles...|$|R

50|$|Since {{the first}} synthesis, many {{investigators}} have successfully assembled capnellene and its derivatives. Approaches to this synthesis are diverse, and include central steps such as annululation, olefin metathesis, <b>radical</b> cyclization, and <b>trapping</b> <b>reactions.</b> The most heavily cited synthesis {{in the literature}} involves two key intermediates formed by a Stille reaction, the palladium-catalyzed coupling of vinyl triflate with vinyl stannane. The readily prepared trimethylcyclopentanone can be converted into vinyl triflate, which is coupled with vinylstannane in the first palladium-catalyzed step to yield the desired divinyl ketone. The second 5-membered ring is formed via Nazarov cyclization, and the product is prepared for a second palladium-catalyzed coupling. This step yields another divinyl ketone, which can be cyclized to an enone, hydrated, and converted to an alkene via olefination to yield capnellene.|$|R
40|$|The {{provitamin}} A carotenoid β-carotene is {{an attractive}} candidate {{for the prevention of}} cancer. Indeed, abundant evidence suggests that β-carotene inhibits carcinogenesis. β-Carotene is thought to inhibit carcinogenesis by scavenging free radicals involved in tumor formation. However, there is no direct evidence that β-carotene <b>traps</b> <b>radicals</b> under conditions where it inhibits carcinogenesis. The overall objective of this dissertation research was to identify β-carotene oxidation products from β-carotene antioxidant reactions in model systems. Identification of such products will enable the direct measurement of β-carotene antioxidant activity in systems where it inhibits neoplastic transformation. In hexane solution, β-carotene was oxidized by peroxyl radicals to 5, 6 -epoxy-β, β-carotene, 15, 15 '-epoxy-β, β-carotene, a previously unreported product, and several unidentified polar products. Studies on the kinetics of product formation suggested that polar products are formed by both epoxide-dependent and -independent pathways. Because β-carotene may be localized within lipid bilayers in vivo, peroxyl radical oxidation of β-carotene in model membranes was examined. In soy phosphatidylcholine liposomes, β-carotene was oxidized by peroxyl radicals to the 5, 6 -epoxide and to unidentified polar products. β-Carotene antioxidant activity in the liposome system was the same at 15 torr and 160 torr O₂ and decreased at 760 torr O₂. These results suggest that β-carotene provides equal antioxidant protection in all tissues in vivo. The relative rates of product formation and β-carotene oxidation at different pO₂ suggested that β-carotene antioxidant activity is governed by the relative proportions of β-carotene <b>radical</b> <b>trapping</b> and autoxidation <b>reactions,</b> which do not contribute to <b>radical</b> <b>trapping.</b> Therefore, the loss of β-carotene antioxidant action at 760 torr O₂ may result from an increase in β-carotene oxidation by autoxidation pathways. The 5, 6 -epoxide was formed during both antioxidant reactions and autoxidation reactions and may be marker for the peroxyl radical oxidation of β-carotene. Attempts to study β-carotene antioxidant reactions in biological membranes were only partially successful. In vitro incorporation of β-carotene into microsomes was attempted by several methods. However, these efforts resulted in only modest β-carotene antioxidant activity in microsomes. These studies provide a basic understanding of β-carotene antioxidant chemistry in model systems. Their results will enable further investigation of β-carotene antioxidant action in biological systems...|$|R

It acts as an electron donor and activates the ferrous heme-oxygen complex intermediate during Arg oxidation (first step) and NOHA oxidation (second step) leading to nitric oxide and citrulline as final products. However, {{its role as a}} proton donor is still debated. Furthermore, its exact involvement has never been explored for other NOSs such as NOS-like proteins from bacteria. This article proposes a comparative study of the role of H(4) B between iNOS and bsNOS.

Coumarin labels were chosen for the <b>radical</b> <b>traps,</b> and unlabeled, singly-labeled, and doubly-labeled Substance P were analyzed by ECD.

Addition of <b>radical</b> <b>traps</b> to the peptide inhibits backbone cleavages, suggesting that either radical mobility is required for these cleavages, or new noncovalent interactions prevent separation of backbone cleavage fragments. The enhancement of side-chain cleavages and the observation of new side-chain cleavages associated with aromatic groups suggest that the gas-phase conformation of this peptide is substantially distorted from untagged Substance P and involves previously unobserved interactions between the coumarin tags and the phenylalanine residues. Furthermore, the use of a double resonance (DR) -ECD experiment showed that these side-chain losses are all products of long-lived radical intermediate species, which suggests that steric hindrance prevents the coumarin-localized radical from interacting with the backbone while simultaneously increasing the radical rearrangements with the side chains...|$|R
