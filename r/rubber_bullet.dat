2500|$|John Dolman, the Parachute Regiment Corporal who was {{the first}} to fire a <b>rubber</b> <b>bullet</b> on the morning of 24 June, was killed in Baghdad in January 2005. He had left the British Army in 2004 and was working for a private {{security}} company. In February 2005, BBC Two screened a documentary about the killings called The Death of the Redcaps which included off the record interviews with members of the army. The British Army's own Board of Inquiry (BoI) into the accident was convened in March 2004. It did not apportion blame to any individuals due to a clause in Queen's Regulations, but did find failures in the system of reporting, accounting and of communication. The BoI was held in camera, as it was felt that the presence of the families would be prejudicial to the evidence. During the cross-examination of witnesses, the Army appointed investigators, put direct questions to the Parachure Regiment troops. These were accusations of abandonment of the RMPs by the Paras and the inference that the platoons had only gone into the town to get some kills [...] as it was one of their last patrols. All of these accusations were vehemently denied.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 November, The Court of Administrative Justice said {{it would}} hold a first hearing on 4 December in a case brought by lawyers and activists against the declaration. Morsi met {{with representatives of the}} Supreme Judicial Council in an effort to settle the crisis over the extent of his powers {{following}} his 22 November constitutional declaration. He agreed to limit his decree on his decisions related to [...] "sovereign matters" [...] only. Morsy [...] "did not give himself judicial power" [...] but did provide [...] "immunity for his presidential decisions," [...] said Jihad Haddad, a senior adviser in the Freedom and Justice Party. Haddad added that [...] "the president himself (is) not immune from judicial oversight," [...] though it wasn't clear in what circumstances that might apply, or if there was anything preventing Morsi from issuing a new decree to forestall that. According to Al-Jazeera [...] "sovereign matters" [...] were widely interpreted to cover the declaration of war, imposition of martial law, breaking diplomatic relations with a foreign nation, or dismissing the cabinet. Activists on Monday camped in Cairo's Tahrir Square for a fourth day, blocking traffic with makeshift barricades to protest against what they said was a power-grab by Morsi. Nearby, riot police and protesters clashed intermittently. In addition to popular outbursts on the street, Egypt's judges reacted. All but seven of Egypt's 34 courts and 90% of its prosecutors went on strike Monday in protest, according to Judge Mohamed al-Zind of the Egyptian Judge's Club. Muslim Brotherhood supporters staged a counter-demonstration, while they were relocated from central Cairo to a location in front of Cairo University in Giza. Egypt's stock market, which had seen a fall of almost 10% on 25 November 2012, recovered some ground on Monday morning. Islam Fathy Massoud member of the Muslim Brotherhood was killed during protests in Damanhour. Gaber Salah, a member of the April 6 Youth Movement, was pronounced dead. He had received a <b>rubber</b> <b>bullet</b> shot at close range during clashes with riot police in downtown Cairo. The funeral of Islam Fathy Massoud, who died in the Nile Delta town of Damanhour in a clash between the president's supporters and opponents, was held on Monday, while in Cairo thousands of people marched through Tahrir Square for the funeral of Gaber Salah.|$|E
