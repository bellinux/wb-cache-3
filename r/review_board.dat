On May 11, 2017, as Glenn Funk, the district attorney of Davidson County, decided not to prosecute police officer Joshua Lippert, they called for an independent community <b>review</b> <b>board</b> and for Nashville police officers to wear body cameras.|$|E
50|$|Civilian <b>review</b> <b>boards</b> {{have also}} been {{proposed}} as another solution to decreasing police brutality. Benefits of civilian <b>review</b> <b>boards</b> can include making sure police are doing their jobs and increasing the relationship the police have with the public. Civilian <b>review</b> <b>boards</b> have gotten criticism though. They can be staffed with police who can weaken {{the effectiveness of the}} boards. Some boards do not have the authority to order investigations into police departments. They can also lack the funding to be an effective tool.|$|R

5|$|The <b>review</b> <b>board</b> {{concluded}} that the IKL/HDW Type2000 was the best design offered, the Walrus class was rated as 'fair', while Kockums' and Vickers' proposals were considered 'marginal' contenders.

50|$|However, {{the problem}} may well extend beyond the FDA to the entire {{research}} oversight system, which depends heavily on a network of Institutional <b>Review</b> <b>Boards</b> to protect subjects. Critics argue that Institutional <b>Review</b> <b>Boards</b> are understaffed and under-qualified, that they are excessively bureaucratic, and that they attempt to restrict research outside their mandate and expertise. Many Institutional <b>Review</b> <b>Boards,</b> {{such as the one}} at the University of Minnesota, are staffed by colleagues of clinical investigators whose studies are being evaluated, raising concerns about personal conflicts of interest. Others, known as “independent” or “commercial” Institutional <b>Review</b> <b>Boards,</b> are funded by research sponsors themselves, an arrangement that arguably presents a financial conflict of interest. Two separate sting operations have found commercial IRBs willing to approve phony research studies deliberately designed to be risky or fraudulent.|$|R

5|$|Because {{there is}} a maximum number of {{established}} positions for ranks warrant officer first class (one per squadron), promotions {{are based on the}} results of a merit <b>review</b> <b>board.</b> The composition of the merit <b>review</b> <b>board</b> includes a minimum of three to a maximum of five members. As appointed by the squadron commanding officer, members include: Commanding officer (or delegate) acting as board chairperson; Air Cadet League or local sponsor representative; and a minimum of one and maximum of three additional members from the following: representative(s) of the RCSU CO (area Cadet Instructor Cadre officer, regional cadet advisor, area cadet officer, etc.), squadron CIC officer(s) (from within own or members of neighbouring squadrons), and member(s) of the community (to include: school principal, Legion member, etc.). Prior to 1976 the size of the squadron dictated the top rank available and many squadrons were ineligible to carry a WO1 on their establishment effectively capping promotion at WO2 for the squadron's ranking cadet.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at the OMSF, Shea helped to resolve {{many of the other}} {{inevitable}} engineering debates and conflicts that cropped up during the development of the Apollo spacecraft. In May 1963, he formed a Panel <b>Review</b> <b>Board,</b> bringing together representatives of the many committees that aimed to coordinate work between NASA centers. Under Shea's leadership, this coordination became far more efficient.|$|E
5|$|He {{served in}} the First and Second World Wars, earning {{appointment}} as a Member of the Order of the British Empire for his medical work during the latter.

5|$|The <b>review</b> <b>board</b> {{determined}} that the electrical power momentarily failed at 23:30:55 GMT, and found evidence of several electric arcs in the interior equipment. They were unable to identify conclusively a single ignition source. They {{determined that}} the fire most likely started near {{the floor in the}} lower left section of the cabin, close to the Environmental Control Unit. It spread from the left wall of the cabin to the right, with the floor being affected only briefly.|$|E
5|$|As Wilkinson's term ended, he {{appointed}} {{himself to a}} six-year term on the University of Kentucky's board of regents. The move was unprecedented, and was particularly controversial because of Wilkinson's open feuds with Charles T. Wethington, Jr., the university president. An incensed legislature passed a law shortly thereafter that dissolved the existing boards of trustees at all Kentucky public colleges and universities and mandated that they be reconstituted by allowing the governor to select each member {{from a list of}} three candidates recommended by an independent <b>review</b> <b>board.</b> Jones, who succeeded Wilkinson as governor, used the provisions of the law to remove Wilkinson and several of his appointees from the university boards.|$|E
5|$|By May 1985, {{three months}} behind schedule, the <b>review</b> <b>board</b> narrowed the tenders {{down to two}} contenders in each group: IKL/HDW and Kockums for the submarine, Rockwell and Signaal for the combat system. The Walrus and Type 2400submarine designs were {{considered}} to be too expensive to manufacture because of inefficient building practices, while the combat data system tenders had been narrowed down by unjustified development risk in the Plessey and Krupp/Ferranti proposals, and the dual problems in the Sintra Alcatel tender of excessive power usage and incompatibility with the proposed American weapons system. On 9 May, the Australian cabinet approved the selections for the funded studies and decided that six submarines would be built, with the option for two more, all in Australia.|$|E

50|$|While {{the origins}} of Dispute <b>Review</b> <b>Boards</b> {{are found in the}} {{construction}} industry, their ambit is far wider than construction and Dispute <b>Review</b> <b>Boards</b> are now found in the financial services industry, the Maritime Industry, long-term concession projects, operational and maintenance contracts. The scope for Dispute <b>Review</b> <b>Boards</b> is substantial. The emergence of the International Chamber of Commerce as an active supporter of Dispute Boards, as well as the Dispute Board Federation and the Dispute Resolution Board Foundation, makes it highly probable that dispute boards will be established in a range of industries that, until now, have not used adjudication to any great extent.|$|R
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Willis {{returned}} to his private practice in Ashland. In 1952, he failed in his bid {{to return to the}} Court of Appeals, having lost to future Governor Bert T. Combs. From 1956 to 1960, he served {{as a member of the}} Kentucky Public Service Commission. In 1958, he received a citation for outstanding service to the state bar. In 1961, he was appointed to the <b>review</b> <b>board</b> authorized by the Veterans' Bonus Act. Also in 1961, he was appointed to the State Parole Board, a position he held until 1965.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Apollo 1 fire, to avoid {{appearance}} of a conflict of interest, NASA Administrator James E. Webb asked President Lyndon B. Johnson to allow NASA to handle the investigation according to its established procedure, promising to be truthful in assessing blame, {{and to keep the}} appropriate leaders of Congress informed. Seamans then directed establishment of the Apollo 204 <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> chaired by Langley Research Center director Floyd L. Thompson, which included astronaut Frank Borman, spacecraft designer Maxime Faget, and six others. On February 1, Cornell University professor Frank A. Long left the board, and was replaced by Dr. Robert W. Van Dolah, of the U.S. Bureau of Mines. The next day, North American's Chief engineer for Apollo, George Jeffs, also left.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, NASA convened the Apollo 204 Accident <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> to {{determine}} the cause of the fire, and both houses of the United States Congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA's investigation. The ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical, and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material, and the high pressure, pure oxygen cabin atmosphere. The astronauts' rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch, which could not be opened against the higher internal pressure of the cabin. A failure to identify the test as hazardous (because the rocket was unfueled) led to the rescue being hampered by poor emergency preparedness.|$|E
