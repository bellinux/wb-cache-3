50|$|Tuning of the R-390A's radio {{frequency}} and intermediate frequency front end is synchronized {{by means of}} an ingenious mechanical system of <b>racks,</b> <b>gears,</b> and cams. When the front panel tuning controls are rotated, this system raises and lowers ferrite slugs {{in and out of the}} receiver's tuning coils. This ensures that all front-end circuits are tracked, meaning all circuits are tuned to the correct frequency to maintain excellent selectivity and sensitivity. The receiver's construction is modular for easy servicing. Each major area of the receiver is contained in easily removable subassemblies, and these can be repaired or replaced as needs be. Though the R-390A is mechanically and electrically complex, alignment and servicing were designed to follow simplified procedures published by the Signal Corps.|$|R

5000|$|After {{finishing}} Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A. tour, Jackson {{expressed his}} ideas about possible improvements to digital audio {{in a conversation}} with Christof Heidelberger, a designer of digital audio electronics, and Betty Bennett, the president of Soundcraft's U.S. division. Jackson, Bennett and Heidelberger formed Apogee Electronics in December 1985 (announced in the 23 November issue of Billboard) and started investigating 44 kHz digital audio circuits for audible problems. They found that [...] "textbook filters" [...] which were unnecessarily steep were protecting the CD player output from high levels of 20 kHz signals, an exceedingly unlikely occurrence in music. Jackson determined that Apogee could improve the sound of CDs if the low-pass filters used in the recording process were made less steep, for less phase shift throughout the hearing range. The small company produced better anti-aliasing filters for recording equipment. Initially operating out of his garage, Jackson served as the company's owner and president, and his third wife Bennett headed up sales. They demonstrated their first product at the Audio Engineering Society's 81st convention held in Los Angeles in November 1986: the 944 Series low-dispersion, linear phase, active low-pass filter, intended to replace existing filters on multi-track digital tape recorders such as the Sony PCM-3324. After a slow start, the firm sold 30,000 of the filters: [...] "a great success." [...] The 944 earned a TEC Award in 1988, the first of many such awards for Apogee. Apogee's branding was largely Jackson's doing. Bennett said in 2005 that the company's decision to sell purple-coloured products was one of Jackson's ideas: [...] "He has a good eye for design, and we wanted to distinguish ourselves from the all-black <b>rack</b> <b>gear</b> that everybody had at that point."
