40|$|In {{the context}} of {{increasing}} global emphasis on partnerships between international, governmental and civil society organisations {{in the distribution of}} international aid, this paper examines {{the ways in which the}} <b>resulting</b> <b>aid</b> chains promote and undermine community-led responses to HIV/AIDS. The impact of the aid-granting system is examined using an ethnographic case study of an HIV/AIDS prevention programme with Cambodian military families. The case study draws on observations of stakeholder meetings and programme activities, interviews with stakeholders (the donor, NGOs and military community) and textual materials (programme guidelines, policies and reports). Campbell et al. 's interrelated concepts of relational, symbolic and material context are used to frame the analysis. The establishment of a relationship with a more powerful international NGO is shown to be beneficial to the military community and civil society groups. The international NGO uses its significant material and economic leverage to improve the community's relational context (by ensuring the support of the military high command), symbolic context (by strengthening the position of community and civil society partners in relation to government bodies) and material context (through increasing access to health services). However, material and symbolic asymmetries between partners in the aid chain persist, curtailing the community's involvement and leadership. At the material and relational levels, the hierarchical flow of aid encourages accountability to the demands of the donor while excluding grassroots groups from directly accessing funding. At the symbolic level, problem-focused representations of the military further reinforce the community's position as recipients of intervention, which undermines recognition for the community's knowledge, strengths and right to fully participate. Thus while aid chains can be supportive of community-led responses, this analysis highlights how the structures and dynamics of international aid continue to position marginalised communities as recipients, not leaders, of HIV/AIDS programmes, raising particular dilemmas for intermediary international NGOs. 9595...|$|E

50|$|The {{utilization}} of the between-group experimental design has several advantages. First, multiple variables, or multiple levels of a variable, can be tested simultaneously, and with enough testing subjects, a large number can be tested.

Additionally, this design saves {{a great deal of}} time, which is ideal if the <b>results</b> <b>aid</b> in a time-sensitive issue, such as healthcare.|$|R

40|$|Very-high-frequency surface {{acoustic}} waves, generated and transmitted along single-crystal lithium niobate, {{are used}} to drive homogeneous aqueous suspensions of polystyrene nanoparticles along microchannels. At a few hundred milliwatts, uniform and mixing flows with speeds of up to 10 mm/s were obtained in centimetres-long rectangular channels with cross-sectional dimensions of tens to a few hundreds of microns. A transition from uniform to mixing flow occurs as the channel width grows beyond the wavelength of sound in the fluid at the chosen excitation frequency. At far lower input powers, the suspension agglomerates into equally spaced, serpentine lines coincident with nodal lines in the acoustic pressure field.

40|$|Although some of today’s popular {{exertion}} games support social experiences, {{they rarely}} consider or support body contact. We believe this limits opportunities to design engaging exertion games. To explore this opportunity, we present Bubble Popper, an exertion game that considers and facilitates body contact with simple technology. Through reflecting on our design and analyzing observations of play {{we are able}} to articulate what impact physical space layout in relation to digital game elements, and physical disparity between input and digital display, can have on body contact. Our <b>results</b> <b>aid</b> game designers in creating engaging exertion experiences by guiding them when considering body contact, ultimately helping players benefiting from more engaging exertion games.

Economic analyses of the add-on price estimates and their sensitivity internal-diameter (ID) sawing, multiblade slurry (MBS) sawing and fixed-abrasive slicing technique (FAST) are presented. Interim price estimation guidelines (IPEG) are used for estimating a process add-on price. Sensitivity analysis of price is performed with respect to cost parameters such as equipment, space, direct labor, materials (blade life) and utilities, and the production parameters such as slicing rate, slices per centimeter and process yield, using a computer program specifically developed to do sensitivity analysis with IPEG. The <b>results</b> <b>aid</b> in identifying the important cost parameters and assist in deciding the direction of technology development efforts...|$|R
