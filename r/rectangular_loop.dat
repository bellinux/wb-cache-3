50|$|On {{each side}} of the helmet there are {{stainless}} steel loops for the chinstrap. The shape of these fixtures {{is one of the most}} recognizable distinguishing factors between shells produced at different times. Early World War II production helmets had fixed, <b>rectangular</b> <b>loops,</b> and late-war and 1960s helmets feature movable <b>rectangular</b> <b>loops</b> which swiveled inward and outward. This swivel feature was adopted in 1943 to address the problem that when earlier helmets were dropped, the loops were more susceptible to breaking off. Early paratrooper shells feature fixed, D-shaped loops. World War II production helmets feature Olive Drab shade 3 chinstraps, replaced starting in 1944-45 with Olive Drab shade 7, cotton web chinstraps that are sewn on. 1960s and 1970s chinstraps are made of olive drab webbing attached to the shell with blackened metal clips. Nylon, clip-on, chinstraps were introduced in the U.S. military in the 1980s and issued to be fitted by the individual serviceman to his own helmet. These straps featured a two-piece web chin cup and were fastened by a metal snap rather than buckle.|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} {{revolving}} armature generators {{is to have}} the armature part on a rotor and the magnetic field part on stator. A basic design, called elementary generator, is to have a <b>rectangular</b> <b>loop</b> armature to cut the lines of force between the north and south poles. By cutting lines of force through rotation, it produces electric current. The current is sent out of the generator unit through two sets of slip rings and brushes, one of which is used for each end of the armature. In this two-pole design, as the armature rotates one revolution, it generates one cycle of single phase alternating current (AC). To generate an AC output, the armature is rotated at a constant speed having the number of rotations per second to match the desired frequency (in hertz) of the AC output.|$|E

It has been numerically shown that natural convection in a 2 D-annular closed-loop thermosyphon is capable of showing pseudoconductive regime at pitchfork bifurcation, stationary convective regimes without and with recirculating regions occurring at the entrance of the exchangers, oscillatory convection at Hopf bifurcation and Lorenz-like chaotic flow.

50|$|This design {{also allows}} us to {{increase}} the output voltage by modifying {{the shape of the}} armature. We can add more <b>rectangular</b> <b>loops</b> to the armature as seen on the picture on the right. The additional loops at the armature arm are connected in series, which are actually additional windings of the same conductor wire to form a coil in rectangular shape. In this example, there are 4 windings in the coil. Since the shapes of all windings are the same, the amount of the lines of force will be cut at the same amount in the same direction {{at the same time in}} all windings. This creates in phase AC output for these 4 windings. As a result, the output voltage is increased 4 time as shown in the sine wave in the diagram.|$|R
