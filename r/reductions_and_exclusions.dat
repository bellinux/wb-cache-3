By imposing a hierarchy on the inclusion <b>and</b> <b>exclusion</b> formula's terms, we develop general <b>reductions</b> for inclusion <b>and</b> <b>exclusion</b> algorithms. We outline sufficient steps to tailor the general reductions to specific problems, and we illustrate this process by applying it to algorithms for several #P problems. We test the reductions {{on the problem}} of counting Hamiltonian paths. Within the framework of the general reductions, we develop the concepts of zero sets and vestigial elements, and we present problem decomposition strategies.

40|$|Acknowledgement of {{the value}} of a basic {{freehand}} sketch by the information and communication community of researchers and developers brought about the advanced developments for the use of sketches as free input to complicated processes of computerized visualization, so as to make them more widely accessible. However, a sharp <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> even <b>exclusion</b> of this <b>and</b> other basic visual disciplines from education in sciences, technology, engineering and architecture dramatically reduces the number of future users of such applications. The unique needs of conservation of cultural heritage pose specific challenges as well as encourage the formulation of innovative development tasks in related areas of information and communication technologies (ICT). This paper claims that the introduction of basic visual disciplines to both communities is essential to the effectiveness of integration of heritage conservation needs and the advanced ICT development of conservation value, and beyond. It provides an insight into the challenges and advantages of introducing these subjects in a relevant educational context, presents some examples of their teaching and learning in the modern environment, including e-learning, and sketches perspectives to their application...|$|R
40|$|Moderate minimum wages {{increases}} {{are known to}} be neutral to employment and beneficial for lower tail wage inequality. Spillover-effects are commonly found, but fade out in the upper tail of the wage distribution. This paper investigates the Belgian case, in which minimum wages are indexed and sector specific wage scales institutionalize wage inequality over the full distribution. We find that the national minimum wage has a reducing effect on lower tail wage inequality that is suppressed by sectoral minimum wages. Sectoral minimum wages, however, have a compressing effect {{on both sides of the}} wage distribution, in part through the <b>reduction</b> of turnover <b>and</b> <b>exclusion</b> of entrants. While observed wage inequality is stable in the period 1996 - 2006, controlling for minimum wages reveals a latent growth in upper tail wage inequality. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the weak links in the processes for poverty reduction in Macedonia. We investigate the weak links between the budget lines and the poverty-reduction programs, involvement of vulnerable categories of people and researchers in the processes for poverty reduction. 27. 1 % of the Macedonian population lived below the poverty line in 2011. In order to reduce poverty, the National Strategy for Poverty <b>Reduction</b> <b>and</b> Social <b>Exclusion</b> has been introduced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy. The budget lines for passive measures account around 45 % of the total Budget spending in contrast to active measures which took only 0. 13 % of all spending in 2013. We have used three different approaches: an analysis of the current strategic documents for poverty reduction, an interview with the people at social risk and a survey among the civil society and academic researchers in the country. The main result is that vulnerable categories of people face with lack of information about measures for poverty reduction, especially those with at most primary education. The citizens are not involved in the process of identifying potential problems of the vulnerable group and the process of construction measures for addressing the problems. Also, the Macedonian social system faces with absent process of monitoring of the spending of the funds and the effects of the used measure. Only 24 % of the respondents were monitored regularly. At the same time, only 18 % of the researchers were involved in the process of creating some strategic document for poverty <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> only 9 % made a social change or their recommendations have potential to be accepted by the policymakers and cause change. ...|$|R

40|$|Eleven {{subjects}} were trained with 1200 trials of {{search for a}} 180 °-rotated letter L amongst 90 °-counterclockwise-rotated Ls, then tested with three transfer stimuli in which target, distractors, or both were changed. According to signal detection theory, learning both increases signal enhancement <b>and</b> external noise <b>exclusion</b> by enlarging the distance between target and distractor response distributions (Dosher and Lu, 1998 Proceedings of the National Academy of the USA 95 13988 - 13993). Similarly, the SERR (search via recursive rejection) model (Humphreys and Muller, 1993 Cognitive Psychology 25 43 - 110) would assume a learning process based upon boosting of target template and distractor grouping and rejection. Finally, the FRS (Fogel, Rubenstein, and Sagi) model of texture segmentation [Sagi, 1991, in Channels in the Visual Nervous System: Neurophysiology, Psychophysics and Models Ed. B Blum (London and Tel Aviv: Freund) pp 397 - 424] would assume a learning process based on the tuning of the appropriate filters to the orientation of target and/or distractor elements at the spatial frequency corresponding {{to the size of}} whole elements. Our results show that learning transfers to a stimulus where low-pass-filtered orientation of the target and distractor is the same (changing either target or distractors); learning does not transfer to a stimulus where both target and distractors are changed; learning abolishes the differences between present and absent responses. Learning may be based upon either additive internal noise <b>reduction</b> <b>and</b> external noise <b>exclusion</b> (Dosher <b>and</b> Lu, 1998), or target template enhancement and distractor grouping and rejection (Humphreys and Muller, 1993) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{notions of}} {{inclusion}} <b>and</b> <b>exclusion</b> {{have a long}} tradition in sociology, but have gained significant currency more recently in public policy analysis. However, a certain conceptual inflexibility arises when the distinction is applied to complex social situations. This article examines the main approaches to inclusion/exclusion in the sociological tradition, systems theory and the theory of new inequalities. On this basis, five interrelated situations of inclusion <b>and</b> <b>exclusion</b> are constructed: self-inclusion/self-exclusion, inclusion by risk/exclusion by danger, compensatory inclusion, inclusion in <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> sub-inclusion. They are illustrated with specific examples to refine an analytical approach to problems of inclusion <b>and</b> <b>exclusion,</b> {{with a view to}} contributing to sociological analysis and to assessing the consequences of public and private decisions...|$|R

40|$|Executive Summary: 1. Southwestern Ontario is {{the most}} densely populated, urbanized, industrialized and intensively farmed part of Canada. The {{remaining}} natural habitat cover is 5 - 10 %, and much {{of this has been}} subjected to intense human-induced disturbance in the past Conservation and habitat restoration is, to put it mildly, a huge challenge. 2. This report explains the 1999 fieldwork results of two projects, part of which comprises the research of Cecilia Tagliavia a York University M. Sc. student. The work done at Point Pelee by Ms. Tagliavia, followed up on the M. Sc. research of Nancy Falkenberg. 3. The overall aim of the research was to determine how best to restore Carolinian plant communities, specifically Oak Savanna and Red Cedar Savanna. 4. Both communities are to some degree a fire-dependent. Rare and endangered species (e. g. Wild Lupine and Karner Blue Butterfly) are present and oak savanna itself is considered to be extremely rare in Ontario and globally imperiled. 5. For Oak Savanna communities at Pinery Provincial Park, our goal was to assess the effects of restoration efforts (deer herd <b>reductions</b> <b>and</b> deer <b>exclusion)</b> on plant community composition. 6. Intensive deer herd <b>reductions,</b> <b>and</b> removal of planted pines at Pinery Provincial Park are allowing the Oak Savanna plant communities {{to move away from the}} species composition of the early to mid- 1990 s, towards communities characterized by prairie and savanna species. We support the proposals to continue deer herd <b>reductions</b> <b>and</b> to carry out prescribed burns at Pinery for the foreseeable future. 7. In the future, the recovery rates of these Oak Savanna communities will depend on the presence of a suitable seedbank and the dispersal rates of individual plant species from local seed sources. 8. For Red Cedar Savanna communities at Point Pelee National Park our goal was to assess the effects of restoration efforts (prescribed burns in 1997 and 1999, soil disking and manipulation of red cedar tree densities) on plant community composition. 9. At Point Pelee, there was a significant increase from 1997 to 1999 in the cover of species native to Red Cedar Savanna at one of the two experimental plots (De Laurier), while at the Nature Reserve the cover of native species declined, but this was not significant compared with 1997. Overall, the communities changed in opposite directions at the two experimental sites, most likely because the native seedbank and availability of seed sources varied. 10. We recommend that prescribed burns in Red Cedar Savanna sites be maintained and that desired species be actively reintroduced if no or low levels of local seed sources are available, in order for these species to compete more effectively with non-native species present at these sites.
