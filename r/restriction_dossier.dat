30|$|During public {{consultation}} regarding the <b>restriction</b> <b>dossier</b> (see Fig.  1), more than 600 comments were received by ECHA, {{much more than}} in all former restriction processes (see Table  1). Numerous comments were received from professional and hobby artists stating {{that they do not}} clean their brushes under the tap rather cleaning rags are used.|$|E
30|$|Application {{of sewage}} sludge {{containing}} Cd from artist paints does not {{increase the amount of}} Cd leached from this soils. Furthermore, the quantity of Cd from artists’ paints calculated in the <b>restriction</b> <b>dossier</b> is negligible compared to other sources of Cd to agricultural soil. Therefore, ECHA did not consider the proposed restriction to be the most appropriate EU wide measure to address the negligible level of risk.|$|E
30|$|An Annex XV <b>restriction</b> <b>dossier</b> for cadmium in artists’ paints was {{submitted}} by an EU member {{state to the}} European Chemicals Agency ECHA. By cleaning, used brushes under the tap cadmium can enter the food chain via waste water treatment and subsequent agricultural application of the sewage sludge. It was estimated that 110  kg Cd per year is spread on agricultural land via this exposure route. Other sources of Cd amount to almost 120 tons per year.|$|E
30|$|The {{addition}} of Cd pigment to the samples {{in the present}} investigation {{does not lead to}} an elevated release. However, concerning the long-term behavior, it might be possible that Cd from artists’ paints is mobilized either by oxidation of sulfide to sulfate or by dissolution at lower pH values. The mobilized Cd (Cd 2 +) will then be transferred via the soil–plant pathway (intake by crops) or via the soil–water pathway leaching, i.e., the outflow of Cd from the top soil. The underlying processes are described in detail elsewhere [34]. In this paper, the behavior of Cd in soil was investigated. The quantity of Cd arising from artists’ paints calculated in the <b>restriction</b> <b>dossier,</b> amounting to 110  kg per year [17], is negligible compared to other sources of Cd to agricultural soils (almost 120 tons/a).|$|E
40|$|Carcinogenic {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) still are frequently found in consumer products such as toys, tool handles, bicycle grips, shoes or sporting goods, {{despite the fact that}} the health hazards of these substances have been known for a long time. PAHs may be present in plastics, elastomer or rubber materials, lacquers, varnishes, paints or other coatings. For this reason, Germany is currently urging the EU to restrict these hazardous compounds in a great variety of products. According to the European chemicals regulation REACH, EU Member States are entitled to propose such restrictions, if they believe that a chemical poses health risks which require Community-wide action. In the context of this restriction procedure, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has performed a human health risk assessment for PAHs in consumer products. Its focus was placed on evaluating the potential carcinogenic risk following contact and uptake via the skin. For this purpose, BfR has evaluated chemical-analytical data on the PAH content of more than 5, 300 consumer products - including grips/handles, toys and sports equipment. These data originated from a number of different laboratories, consumer protection institutions or BfR itself. Products for everyday use by consumers and children in particular sometimes displayed very high PAH contents. The BfR risk assessment is part of a <b>restriction</b> <b>dossier</b> compiled by several German authorities. It was handed over to the European Commission in June 2010. The dossier contains a recommendation to restrict the content of carcinogenic PAHs in consumer products to a maximum of 0. 2 mg/kg. This limit value is based on the Limit of Quantification (LOQ) of the analytical test method used for the German GS (certified safety) mark. In addition, it is proposed that future technical progress is monitored and the limit value is adjusted to future (lower) analytical quantification limits as appropriate...|$|E
30|$|In the <b>restriction</b> <b>dossier</b> [17], a {{value of}} 1.4  mg Cd/kg sewage sludge (dry matter, median of 18 EU {{countries}} ranging from < 0.4 to 4) applied to agricultural soils was used for all calculations. The value for Cd in sewage in Germany was 1.0  mg/kg which fits well to the sewage sludge survey of the German Association for Water, Wastewater and Waste (DWA) from 2003 (median Cd content 1.15  mg/kg) [27]. The median value for the German Federal state Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is even lower (0.65  mg/kg) [28]. According to the German Ordinance on Fertilizers [29] a limit value of 1.5  mg Cd/kg was set into force from January 1 st, 2015 for sewage sludge in agricultural applications. This limit value excludes some 5  % of the sludge generated in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (97, 000 ton per year) from direct application in agriculture [28]. However, due to the new limits in the Fertilizer Ordinance, some 20  % of the sewage sludge generated are excluded now from agricultural application because of a mercury content above 1  mg/kg, also. Exclusion of highly contaminated sewage sludge by setting stringent limit values {{seems to be an}} effective measure to reduce contaminant transfer to agricultural soil at least for heavy metal contamination. However, there are also organic pollutants in sewage sludge such as emerging pollutants of concern (EMPOC), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP), among others antibiotics, endocrine disruptors, fragrances, UV filters, and antiseptics which are released to the environment [30] and where no limits exist so far. That is the reason that agricultural application of sewage sludge is under discussion in several EU countries. In Germany, Belgium, Slovenia, and The Netherlands, the majority of the sludge (55 – 70  %) is incinerated (Eurostat data from 2013, database env_ww_spd). But whereas organic pollutants are destroyed during incineration, heavy metals remain in the ash. According to a survey on sewage sludge ash in Germany, the resulting ash contains 1.4  mg Cd/kg (median, values from < 0.1 to 80.3  mg/kg) [30]. Processes to enable recovery of phosphorus from sewage sludge ash for fertilizer production after removal of heavy metals are available [31].|$|E
