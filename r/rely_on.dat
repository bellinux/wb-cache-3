5|$|Gaza's cuisine is {{characterized}} by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also {{played an important role}} in determining many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as saliq wa adas ("chard and lentils") and bisara (skinless fava beans mashed with dried mulukhiya leaves and chilies).|$|E

5|$|Adult {{pelicans}} <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> visual {{displays and}} behaviour to communicate, particularly using their wings and bills. Agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting and snapping at opponents with their bills, or lifting and waving their wings in a threatening manner. Adult pelicans grunt when at the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season. Conversely, colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively.|$|E
5|$|As {{an element}} with high {{electron}} density and atomic number, iodine absorbs X-rays weaker than 33.3keV {{due to the}} photoelectric effect of the innermost electrons.

As a patient <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> [...] "feeling" [...] sounds rather than hearing them, they subconsciously hear with their sense of touch, therefore reacting to auditory stimuli without actually hearing sound.|$|R

Finally, atomicity itself <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> durability to ensure the atomicity of transactions even in the face of external failures.|$|R

40|$|The late Jim Gray, who {{received}} the prestigious Turing Award in computer science and was {{a pioneer in the}} development of relational databases, proposed the "Fourth Paradigm" to describe the field of data-intensive science (Hey et al., 2009). In Jim's presentation to the National Research Council Computer Science and Telecommunications Board in 2007, he described the first three paradigms as empirical (<b>relying</b> <b>on</b> observations of nature), theoretical (<b>relying</b> <b>on</b> models), and computational (<b>relying</b> <b>on</b> computer simulations). The fourth paradigm was data exploration, which, in his view, combined theory, experiment, and simulation. Moreover, it <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> computational tools and processes to explore massive and diverse data sets...|$|R
50|$|The English Romantic Poets were {{concerned}} with Milton's poetry, and they associated themselves with Milton as they sought to explore their own poetic identities. In particular, the various poets <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> images and ideas found in Milton, and they incorporated them into their own works. William Wordsworth, in his The Prelude, <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> Milton's concept {{of the fall of}} man in order to revise the myth and to try and overcome the loss of paradise. John Keats, in The Eve of St Agnes, <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> images connected to Paradise Lost and Eve's description. Percy Shelley, in Mont Blanc, <b>relies</b> <b>on</b> Milton's description of sensations, especially smell, to achieve the sublime.|$|R
