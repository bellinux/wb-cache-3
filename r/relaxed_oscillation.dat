40|$|Background and Putpose. Stzmess is {{a common}} {{clinical}} complaint but is rarely quunttjied by clinicians. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the reliability of a <b>relaxed</b> <b>oscillation</b> test that yields sttfizess and damping coeficients of the knee. These coeficients describe the knee joint's resistance to bending and the time-dependent nature of that resistance. Suwects and M e t b h. Efects of age, gender, and knee position on these coeficients were messed in 96 healthy volunteers aged 20 to 79 years. Measures were based on the premise that the knee joint can be modeled as a damped spring. Oscillations of the knee were recorded using an electrogoniometer with the knee oscillating through about 45 and 75 degrees of knee flexion. Results. Zntraclm correlation coeficients revealed mod-erate to high reliability in the measurements taken three times In the same test session and on three separate days. Analysis of variance showed signtjicant in-creases in sttjkzess and damping coeficients in the male subjects as compared with the female subjects. Analysis of variance also suggested an age e$ect on stiiess coeficients at the 75 -degree test position, with decreasing sttfizess with age. Both sttfizess and damping coeficients were sign@icantly smaller when measured at the 75 -degree test position compared with the 45 -degree position (Student's t test). C o n c l d n and Discusdon. These results demonstrate a reliable method of measuring knee joint stt@zess, and they correlate well with known morphological dtyerences related to age and gender. This measure may prove to be more use&l in evaluating the function of the knee than more commonly used m e m t s. It may also lead to a better understanding of how the knee functions in such activi-ties as locomotion. [Oatis CA.

40|$|Analyses of {{multiple}} pulse sequences of B 2303 + 30 reveal that this pulsar has two distinct emission modes. One mode (B) follows a steady even-odd pattern {{and is more}} intense. The second mode (Q) is characteristically weak, but has intermittent driftbands with a periodicity of approximately 3 P/cycles, and nulls much more frequently than the B mode. Both modes occur with roughly equal frequency and their profiles have a similar single-humped form with a slight asymmetry. Our observations and analyses strongly suggest that the subpulse driftrates in both modes are linked {{in a series of}} cycles, which can be modelled as <b>relaxing</b> <b>oscillations</b> in the underlying circulation rate.

40|$|The {{majority}} of intracellular signalling cascades in higher eukaryotes are initiated by GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors). Hundreds of GPCRs signal through {{a handful of}} trimeric G-proteins, raising the issue of signal specificity. In the present paper, we illustrate a simple kinetic model of G-protein signalling. This model shows that stable production of significant amounts of free GαGTP (GTP-bound Gα subunit) and βγ {{is only one of}} multiple modes of behaviour of the G-protein system upon activation. Other modes, previously uncharacterized, are sustained production of βγ without significant levels of GαGTP and transient production of GαGTP with sustained βγ. The system can flip between different modes upon changes in conditions. This model demonstrates further that the negative feedback of receptor uncoupling or internalization, when combined with a positive feedback within the G-protein cycle, under a broad range of conditions results not in termination of the response but in <b>relaxed</b> <b>oscillations</b> in GPCR signalling. This variety of G-protein responses may serve to encode signal specificity in GPCR signal transduction...|$|R
40|$|We derive {{the linear}} Langevin {{equation}} {{that describes the}} behavior of critical fluctuation above the critical temperature of the chiral phase transition in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The Langevin equation <b>relaxes</b> exhibiting <b>oscillation</b> and shows thermalization. The relaxation becomes slower as the system approaches the critical point(the critical slowing down). The time correlation function also calculated using the Langevin equation shows that there exists the same soft mode as the previous calculation in the linear response theory.

30|$|The central rest-mass density also {{undergoes}} {{an evolution}} (right panel of Figure  12), with oscillations {{triggered by the}} treatment of the stellar surface. Both schemes perform at a similar level of accuracy, with relative variations from the initial value no greater than about 0.3 % (even though spurious peaks are present in both data series at various times). The short term behaviour of the two schemes is noticeably different, and the frequency content in the two data series appears different, with the MP 5 scheme seeming to show more pronounced high-frequency modes. However, at later times both schemes appear to <b>relax</b> and <b>oscillations</b> decrease significantly in amplitude.|$|R
40|$|We derive {{the linear}} Langevin {{equation}} {{that describes the}} behavior of the fluctuations of the order parameter of the chiral phase transition above the critical temperature by applying the projection operator method to the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at finite temperature and density. The Langevin equation <b>relaxes</b> exhibiting <b>oscillation,</b> reveals thermalization and converges to the equilibrium state consistent with the mean-field approximation as time goes on. With the help of this Langevin equation, we further investigate the relaxation of the critical fluctuations. The relaxation time of the critical fluctuations increases at speed as the temperature approaches toward the critical temperature because of the critical slowing down. The critical slowing down is enhanced as the chemical potential increases because of the Pauli blocking. Furthermore, we find another enhancement of the critical slowing down around the tricritical point. Comment: Style file is changed, references are added, 42 pages, 14 figures, Nucl. Phys.

40|$|The Reissner-Nordström {{black hole}} {{provides}} the prototypical {{description of a}} holographic system at finite density. We study the response of this system {{to the presence of}} a local, charged impurity. Below a critical temperature, the induced charge density, which screens the impurity, exhibits oscillations. These oscillations {{can be traced to the}} singularities in the density-density correlation function moving in the complex momentum plane. At finite temperature, the oscillations are very similar to the Friedel oscillations seen in Fermi liquids. However, at zero temperature the oscillations in the black hole background remain exponentially damped, while Friedel <b>oscillations</b> <b>relax</b> to a power-law...|$|R
40|$|The airway {{smooth muscle}} (ASM) plays an {{important}} role in the mechanism of respiratory system. Asthma, a common respiratory disease is associated with ASM hyper-contraction and shortening of airway diameter. This results in occlusion of the airway lumen leading to breathing difficulties. Various studies have shown that ASM can be <b>relaxed</b> by length <b>oscillations.</b> Previous experiments on ASM by applying sinusoidal oscillation at low frequencies and high amplitudes have showed a clear reduction in active force. Similar tests for a larger frequency range on ASM have also shown large reduction in dynamic force. But, it is not well known what parameters induce relaxation the most on ASM. The purpose of our research is to see the degree of relaxation when superimposed oscillations are applied on breathing and see which parameter relaxes smooth muscle the most. This research also focuses on investigating the effect of pulse oscillation rather than sinusoidal oscillation on contracted ASM. Isolated ASM were tested using pulse oscillations with wide range of frequency, amplitude and duration. Results obtained from these experiments showed that pulse oscillation with short duration had significant effect on the relaxation of ASM compared to sinusoidal oscillations with longer duration...|$|R
40|$|Vibration is {{a manual}} {{technique}} used widely {{to assist with}} the removal of pulmonary secretions. Little is known about how vibration is applied or its effect on the respiratory system. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe mechanical consequences of vibration on the chest wall of a normal subject and the effects of vibration on expiratory flow rates and volumes. The effects of vibration were compared to other interventions of chest wall compression, chest wall oscillation, cough, huff from high lung volume, inspiration to total lung capacity with relaxed expiration, tidal breathing, and sham. Sixteen physiotherapists applied vibration and other interventions in a randomised order to the chest wall of a healthy adult female subject. The magnitude and direction of the force and the frequency of vibration were measured by an instrumented bed with seven load cells. Inductive plethsysmography measured the change in chest wall circumference with vibration. A heated pneumotachometer measured inspiratory and expiratory flow rates, which were integrated to provide volumes. Vibration was applied with a mean resultant force of 74. 4 N (SD 47. 1). The mean (SD) change in chest wall circumference and frequency of vibration were 0. 8 cm (SD 0. 4) and 5. 5 Hz (SD 0. 8) respectively. The mean peak expiratory flow rate was 0. 97 l/s (SD 0. 27). Peak expiratory flow rates with vibration were less than 20 % of those achieved with cough or huff from high lung volume but greater than with chest wall compression, chest wall <b>oscillation,</b> <b>relaxed</b> expiration from total lung capacity, sham treatment or tidal breathing...|$|R
