40|$|BACKGROUND: Setting {{specifications}} for <b>analytical</b> <b>quality</b> is always difficult. The risk-management approach {{might be a}} way to do so. In this approach, the definition of the required <b>analytical</b> <b>quality</b> is based on the evaluation of patient risk. Risk derives from the probability of error and from the damage that such an error might cause. METHODS: Eight Italian laboratories took part in this experiment. Measurements of glucose and total calcium were taken as examples. <b>Analytical</b> <b>quality</b> was evaluated using a specific ring trial with a frozen serum pool and by means of internal quality-control data. The total allowable error was defined according to biological variation specifications. The probability of error was extracted from the imprecision and comparative bias data of each laboratory. The damage caused by a wrong result was evaluated using the absolute probability judgment approach. RESULTS: According to the iso-risk plots (standardized hyperboles on a graph where the x-axis represents damage and the y-axis represents probability) for glucose, all the laboratories were working with an <b>analytical</b> <b>quality</b> that guaranteed low risk for patients. On the contrary, for total calcium none of the laboratories exhibited sufficient quality to guarantee low risk for patients, the presence of bias being the most relevant problem. CONCLUSIONS: The results seem to demonstrate the applicability of the risk approach to the analytical phase, indicating a new possible way to define <b>analytical</b> <b>quality</b> targets...|$|R

40|$|Background: Manufacturers and {{laboratories}} {{might benefit}} from using a modern integrated tool for quality management/assurance. The tool should not be confounded by commutability issues {{and focus on the}} intrinsic <b>analytical</b> <b>quality</b> and comparability of assays as performed in routine laboratories. In addition, it should enable monitoring of long-term stability of performance, with the possibility to quasi "real-time" remedial action. Therefore, we developed the "Empower" project. Methods: The project comprises four pillars: (i) master comparisons with panels of frozen single-donation samples, (ii) monitoring of patient percentiles and (iii) internal quality control data, and (iv) conceptual and statistical education about <b>analytical</b> <b>quality.</b> In the pillars described here (i and ii), state-of-the-art as well as biologically derived specifications are used. Results: In the 2014 master comparisons survey, 125 laboratories forming 8 peer groups participated. It showed not only good intrinsic <b>analytical</b> <b>quality</b> of assays but also assay biases/non-comparability. Although laboratory performance was mostly satisfactory, sometimes huge between-laboratory differences were observed. In patient percentile monitoring, currently, 100 laboratories participate with 182 devices. Particularly, laboratories with a high daily throughput and low patient population variation show a stable moving median in time with good between-instrument concordance. Shifts/drifts due to lot changes are sometimes revealed. There is evidence that outpatient medians mirror the calibration set-points shown in the master comparisons. Conclusions: The Empower project gives manufacturers and laboratories a realistic view on assay quality/comparability as well as stability of performance and/or the reasons for increased variation.

40|$|The definition, {{implementation}} and monitoring of valuable <b>analytical</b> <b>quality</b> specifications {{have played a}} fundamental role in improving the quality of laboratory services and reducing the rates of analytical errors. However, a body of evidence has been accumulated on the relevance of the extra-analytical phases, namely the pre-analytical steps, their vulnerability and impact on the overall quality of the laboratory information. The identification and establishment of valueable quality indicators (QIs) represents a promising strategy for collecting data on quality in the total testing process (TTP) and, particularly, for detecting any mistakes made in the individual steps of the pre-analytical phase, thus providing useful information for quality improvement projects. The consensus achieved on the developed list of harmonized QIs is a premise for the further step: the identification of achievable and realistic performance targets based on the knowledge of the state-of-the-art.
