It is used to create sheets of uniform thickness, to mix colors or created variegated sheets, and to condition (soften) the clay. Polymer clay generally needs to be conditioned prior to use. This involves kneading the clay by hand, passing it between two rollers, or using a low-shear mixer to break up any <b>resin</b> <b>particle</b> adhesions. Once conditioned, the clay will remain pliable until the particles eventually re-adhere.|$|E

This investigation compares measurements of bone blood flow made with the 2 different materials, using a reference artery method. <b>Resin</b> <b>particles</b> (1. 4 mg per rat) were compared with 2 different doses of 85 Sr-labelled microspheres (1 mg and 3 mg per rat). Whole bone blood flow from the 3 groups was not statistically different. Regional bone blood flow comparisons using <b>resin</b> <b>particles</b> and 1 mg dose microspheres showed no significant difference in epiphyses or metaphyses. In the resin group, marrow flow was significantly lower, and cortical flow elevated.
