60|$|Barbara <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> {{building}} very well, and {{it suddenly}} flashed upon her that Brooke had {{on one occasion}} displayed a curious acquaintance with it. Everything that afternoon seemed to force him upon her recollection.|$|R

50|$|The {{similarity}} {{to the first}} verse of the Yeats version is unmistakable and would suggest that this was indeed <b>the</b> song Yeats <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> woman singing. <b>The</b> rest of the song, however, is quite different.|$|R
50|$|As a 16-year-old, Natsu is Hisako's eldest {{daughter}} and Seita and Setsuko's cousin. She forms {{a relationship with}} Seita and protests how Hisako treats Seita and Setsuko. As a 76-year-old she <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> days and tells the story to her granddaughter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gone!" [...] exclaimed the Warden. [...] "This is sudden; {{and strange}} {{that he should}} go without saying good by. Gone," [...] and then he <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> pensioner's eagerness that the Warden should come here, and Elsie's strange {{injunction}} that he should insist on seeing Redclyffe.

6000|$|... "Ah, I see," [...] said Colville, {{peering at}} her under his thoughtfully knitted brows, [...] "you do belong to another era. You don't <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> negro {{minstrel}} song." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{soldier is}} well {{received}} {{at the palace}} just as the others had been and indeed, in the evening, the princess royal (the eldest daughter) comes to his chamber and offers him a cup of wine. <b>The</b> soldier, <b>remembering</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> woman's advice, throws it away secretly and begins to snore loudly as if asleep.|$|R
60|$|I {{found myself}} at home, and {{suddenly}} I <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> steward, whom I {{had left in}} charge of my house. His name was Fabio; it was from him that I got the name when I presented myself as a serving-man to old Orso. If anything {{had taken place in}} the house he must know it; and she, Claudia, said the whole town knew it.|$|R
60|$|She {{ended with}} a little sob, and turned her face away to hide the {{trembling}} of her lips. At that, Jack flushed up, his eyes shone, and he stooped suddenly {{as if to make}} some impetuous reply. But, <b>remembering</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> lady (who, by the by, was discreetly looking out of the window), he put {{his hands in his pockets}} and strolled out of the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} Curtises must have brought half their {{greenhouse}} down. Do you <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> oak-leaf geranium {{that you used}} to gather a leaf of whenever you passed our old conservatory?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, dear! Oh, dear! If only I {{had time}} to think!"

6000|$|... [5] Of the Brooklyn of {{that time}} (1830-40) hardly {{anything}} remains, except the lines of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> streets. <b>The</b> population was then between ten and twelve thousand. For a mile Fulton street was lined with magnificent elm trees. The character of the place was thoroughly rural. As a sample of comparative values, it may be mention'd that twenty-five acres {{in what is now}} the most costly part of the city, bounded by Flatbush and Fulton avenues, were then bought by Mr Parmentier, a French emigre, for $4000. Who <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> places as they were? Who <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> citizens {{of that time}}? Among the former were Smith & Wood's, Coe Downing's, and other public houses at <b>the</b> ferry, <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Ferry itself, Love lane, the Heights as then, the Wallabout with the wooden bridge, and the road out beyond Fulton street to <b>the</b> <b>old</b> toll-gate. Among <b>the</b> latter were the majestic and genial General Jeremiah Johnson, with others, Gabriel Furman, Rev. E. M. Johnson, Alden Spooner, Mr. Pierrepont, Mr. Joralemon, Samuel Willoughby, Jonathan Trotter, George Hall, Cyrus P. Smith, N. B. Morse, John Dikeman, Adrian Hegeman, William Udall, and old Mr. Duflon, with his military garden.|$|R

5000|$|Tomás Milián, {{who played}} the Batista's head of secret police, had lived in Cuba during the 1950s, and commented that the film recreated Havana during the Batista regime's last days in great detail. Many of the extras were exiled Cubans who {{had moved to the}} Dominican Republic. According to Sydney Pollack, [...] "The {{atmosphere}} became quite emotional... They <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> days in Havana. Our set took them back 30 years." ...|$|R
60|$|La Fleur {{had come}} to see Mrs. Drane, but perceiving Miss Panney's phaeton at the door, she had {{concluded}} that there was company in the house, and had consequently betaken herself to the kitchen to make inquiries.

6000|$|... "The {{window was}} open, granted. But {{the room is}} on the second floor. Anyway, you may dismiss the window. I <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> lady saying there was a bar across it, and that nobody could have {{squeezed}} through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And a very honorable {{record it}} is," [...] exclaimed the Colonel. [...] "Jinny, we shall read it {{together}} {{when we go}} a-visiting to Culvert House. I <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> gentleman as well as if I had seen him yesterday." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{estate was}} later sold and divided. <b>The</b> <b>old</b> palace was {{demolished}} {{to make way}} for large, modern offices which were constructed in the 1990s. The state house of Himachal Pradesh, Himachal Bhawan, is now located here. The headquarters Doordarshan Bhawan of the national television broadcaster Doordarshan is also located here. Today, the name of <b>the</b> office complex <b>remembers</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> royal residence as well the Mandi House metro station.

6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{sorry for}} that!" [...] exclaimed Alora, who <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> kindly <b>old</b> doctor with real affection. He had been {{not only her}} mother's {{physician}} but her valued friend.|$|R
25|$|The besieging army redoubled {{their efforts}} and soon {{rendered}} the fort untenable. In their hour of supreme peril they <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Maharani Kishori, who had outlived {{the glory of}} house of Bharatpur, and been pining in neglect and retirement {{after the death of}} Maharaja Jawahar Singh. Ranjit Singh's well-wishers advised him to send <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Rani Kishori to the Mughal camp, because she enjoyed the respect and good-will of the high officers of Amir-ul-umra and might possibly by her intercession procure pardon for his past offenses.|$|R
