40|$|Introduction. Although {{platelets}} are {{not part}} of the classical immune system, they have many features that indicate their role in the anti-infective host defense. They come into interactions with microorganisms, which results in co-aggregation and co-adhesion or destruction of themicrobes due to the action of antimicrobial peptides released from platelets. The aim of this study was to evaluate the killing effect of platelets against planktonic and biofilm cultures of Staphylococcus aureus and to test their synergy with antibiotics. Materials and Methods. S. aureus ATCC 29213; platelet rich plasma (1 - 3 days <b>post</b> <b>shelf</b> life). Evaluation of bactericidal activity of platelets or their lysates against planktonic cultures of S. aureus – CFU calculation after 4 - and 24 -hour co-incubation. Assessment of S. aureus biofilm viability under the influence of platelets – Live/Dead® BacLightTM Bacterial Viability Kit. Determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (oxacillin, vancomycin, linezolid) and estimation of the synergistic action of antibiotics and platelet lysates – a gradient-diffusion test strip. Results. Microbicidal activity of “expired” platelets and their lysates has been shown as a significant reduction in the population of staphylococci in their planktonic cultures by 56 - 87 � 0 and a decrease in metabolic activity of biofilm formation by 7 - 38 � 20 These activities were enhanced after activation with ADP. Platelet lysates showed a synergistic effect with β-lactam antibiotic (oxacillin) and glycopeptide (vancomycin) but not with oxazolidinone (linezolid). Conclusions and Discussion. In summary, platelets even after the medical expiry date are still a good source of antimicrobial low molecular weight proteins (PMPs). Testing of bacterialresistance to PMPs may be advisable as a predictive indicator of susceptibility to treatment of infections such as infective endocarditis and other local infections of biofilm nature...|$|R
40|$|Edible coating is {{a simple}} and {{inexpensive}} concept for extending post-harvest life of fruits and vegetables. In this study, cucumbers were coated with different pectin-based emulsions to preserve the fruit quality and extend the <b>post</b> harvest <b>shelf</b> life. The formulations consisted of pectin, beeswax, sorbitol, water, and an emulsifying agent. By monitoring the physiological and quality parameters, the coating effects on the storability of cucumber fruits at 23 °C and 40 % RH (display cabinet), and 12 °C and 85 % RH (cold room) were determined. The parameters included weight loss, respiration rate, firmness, color, soluble solids and chlorophyll content. The coating markedly reduced weight loss and respiration rate at both temperatures. In addition, the coating reduced loss of firmness, color, chlorophyll and total soluble solids, and extended the storage life of cucumber fruits at both storage conditions. </p...|$|R

It {{is part of the}} collection of The Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Over time Dieter Rams has made various improvements and additions to the system. The system is based on vertical <b>posts</b> having <b>shelves,</b> cabinets, panels and desks hanging onto it. The system can be wall-mounted, semi wall-mounted which has the system carry its own weight and compressed between the floor and ceiling. If used in a compressed way, shelves can be added on both sides. The system features two distinct segment widths of 65.5 cm and 90 cm and height increments of 7 cm. Due to the way of mounting, shelves can be mounted either way up and even be mounted on the side to feature as a panel for magnets. Similarly the small desk shelf can be hung either way depending on the preferred desk setup. The system also features accessories like drawer dividers and cable conduits. The system is available in off-white, black and silver and can additionally feature beech tops.|$|R
40|$|In {{the face}} of great {{potential}} of 1 -MCP in blocking ethylene action, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of 1 -MCP on ethylene action and extend the post-production of ornamental peppers Capsicum annuum potted plants. Ornamental pepper cultivar Calypso shows complete abscission of leaves when exposed to 10 &# 181;L L- 1 ethylene. By exposing plants to ethylene, significant drops on a, b and total chlorophyll were found {{at the end of}} the treatment. Nevertheless, no changes on leaf total carotenoid were observed after the treatment with ethylene. When the plants were treated with 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP), followed or not by treatment with ethylene, contents of a, b, total chlorophyll and carotenoid remained unchanged. Control plants showed no changes in chlorophylls or carotenoid contents after 48 hours from moving the pots from greenhouse to indoor conditions illuminated with white fluorescent light. The 1 -MCP was able to prolong the <b>post</b> production <b>shelf</b> life, by inhibiting the abscission of leaves. Plants treated with 1 -MCP, followed by ethylene had 38 % accumulated leaf abscission, after 18 days of post production life, similar to control plants. After the same period, plants treated only with 1 -MCP had 22 % leaf abscission. The 1 -MCP partially blocked ethylene and induced leaf abscission. Regardless which treatment was applied during post production life, there was a continuous decrease on leaf chlorophyll content beyond 18 th day. Thus, 1 -MCP was effective in preventing leaf abscission even in the presence of ethylene, avoiding deleterious effects of ethylene by blocking its receptor sites...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The mangaba (Hancornia spp.) is {{a native}} fruit and latex tree of wide spread {{occurrence}} in the Brazilian Savannh, Pantanal, Amazon, and Atlantic Coast from Amapá to Espírito Santo States. It {{is also found in}} the neighbouring countries of Paraguai, Bolívia, Peru and Venezuela. This specie has a great potential due to its low caloric fruits which present a special taste and flavor and are much appreciated by the local population such as fresh fruits, juices, icecream, fruit-jelly and liqueur. Its <b>post</b> harvest short <b>shelf</b> fruit life and the large distance from the consumers centers can not support the increasing demand for this fruit, leading farmers to interest in its cultivation. Hence, much research is needed, mainly the appropriate sexual and vegetative propagartion methods. Like many other fruit trees, the latest method seems to be the first step for the domestication and cultivation of native species. In this way, grafting and budding techniques are very important for fruit tree cloning and breeding. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to present the latest results about the potential and use of grafting and budding on mangaba, and to ofter technical advice to the breeders and the farmers dealing with this specie. Many aspects about rootstocks production, grafting and budding approaches are discussed, including the nursey management practices, such as seed and sowing details, recipients and substrates, manuring, watering, pest and disease control. 200...|$|R
40|$|This {{consumer}} {{study was}} conducted to assess how effective shelf talker advertisements with nutrition related health claims are at selling fresh produce. Background research was conducted to determine the appropriate displays and FDA defined label claims. The study <b>posted</b> visually appealing <b>shelf</b> talker advertisements next to their respective produce item and compared the recorded sales a week prior to the advertising campaign to the following week with advertisements. Two separate observation periods were conducted at Spencer’s San Luis Obispo and Arroyo Grande locations after the first period in June 2011 produced a surprisingly small amount of statistically significant data. The study ended with eleven produce items’ unit sales results with and without shelf talker advertisements from both Spencer’s locations after two strong, but unsuccessful attempts to positively influence produce sales from a statistically significant standpoint. The data for each location was entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to run paired t-tests for means. The results for each store communicated similar analysis to the basic sales data comparisons, which lead to rejecting the study’s proposed hypothesis that sales would increase during the second week of the study with advertising. Despite unfavorable results, this study {{can be used as a}} guide for future studies assessing consumer responses to different types of FDA nutritional claims as well as a reference to how custom produce displays and product placement in grocery stores can influence consumer purchasing behaviors...|$|R
40|$|Ripening is {{a process}} in fruits that causes them to become more edible. In general, a fruit becomes sweeter, less green, and softer as it ripens. However the acidity as well as {{sweetness}} rises during ripening, but the fruit still tastes sweeter regardless. An organic compound involved with ripening is ethylene, a gas created by plants from the amino acid methionine. Ethylene increases the intracellular levels of certain enzymes in fruit and fresh-cut products, which include: • Amylase, which hydrolyzes starch to produce simple sugars, and • Pectinase, which hydrolyzes pectin, a substance that keeps fruit hard. Other enzymes break down the green pigment chlorophyll, which is replaced by blue, yellow, or red pigment. 1 Mango fruits ripen unevenly on the tree and natural ripening can be very slow and unpredictable. Hence, {{to overcome these problems}} certain chemicals are used to ripen the fruits artificially. Fruits are briefly exposed to ethylene or similar gases like acetylene to initiate the ripening process. Ethylene is known to be a plant hormone that triggers fruit ripening. It has been reported that if ethylene is applied exogenously it helps fruit ripening. 2 Ethylene-treatment is usually given at the packing house or at the point of distribution. Ethephon is {{known as one of the}} most common ethylene-generating chemical and post harvest treatments. Ethephon accelerates ripening and improves the peel color of the mangoes. 3 Though ethylene promotes the ripening process & improves colour development of the fruits, it has some disadvantages in <b>post</b> harvest <b>shelf</b> life & can be harmful to product quality. Furthermore it is an explosive gas & is very expensive. Use of ethylene for ripening of the fruit is a common practice in different countries but due to high cost and scarcity in terms of its availability, many developing countries like Bangladesh, India & Pakistan use low-cost calcium carbide to ripen fruit. Usually calcium carbide is imported from China, Taiwan and South Africa. Acetylene gas is generated from calcium carbide, which initiates the ripening process in a similar manner to ethylene. This practice is commercially used in Brazil and Senegal. 4 Fruits ripened with calcium carbide are soft and have good peel color development but poor in flavor. A number of countries use calcium carbide to ripen a wide range of fruits as shown in Table-I...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the seasonal variation of copepods in the Senegal-Gambia maritime area, using a comparative approach (cold season (May) and warm season (November)) was carried out using data collected during ecosystem cruises aboard the Norwegian vessel Fridtjof Nansen in November 2011 and May 2012. Zooplankton samples were collected between 0 and 50 m depth using a multinet of 80 &# 956;m mesh, towed obliquely behind the vessel, over the continental <b>shelf.</b> <b>Post</b> processing of the samples (n = 34) were made in laboratory by microscopy and the copepod were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and counted, using appropriate identification keys. Paracalanus parvus was dominant with 22 % followed by Oncaea venusta (19 %) and Temora stylifera (12 %) in the cold season. In contrast, in the warm season, these two species (P. parvus O. venusta) still dominant with 26 % and 13 %, respectively. A total of 34 species of copepods were identified during the cold season, compared with 27 species during the warm season. In one hand, during the cold season, an area of high concentration of copepods was found off {{the mouth of the}} Casamance River. On the other hand, during the warm season, two areas of high concentration were identified off the peninsula of Cap-Vert and Casamance. The copepod group which represents 2 / 3 of the zooplankton would be an ideal indicator for the identification of signatures of changes in phenology and / or latitudinal displacement of species in relation to climatic variations. All of these aspects reflect the interest of this study in improving knowledge of the responses of marine organisms to climate change in the south part of the west African east border upwelling...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is to develop pectin-based edible films for {{application}} {{of fruits and vegetables}} to extend their <b>post</b> harvest <b>shelf</b> life. Preliminary research demonstrated that edible coatings could effectively extend the shelf life of based avocado and peach. The respiration rate, moisture loss, firmness, chemical parameters and color changed in a lower rate in coated fruits as compared with the control. Pectin-based film formulations were then evaluated to identify the proper type and concentration of pectin, lipids and plasticizers in the film. The effects of pectin, beeswax and sorbitol concentration on water vapor permeability, mechanical properties and opacity of the films were then evaluated using response surface methodology to identify appropriate levels of different components. Results of studies on film structure revealed that water vapor permeability increased by pectin and sorbitol concentration and was decreased by beeswax concentration. Mechanical properties were mainly affected by pectin and sorbitol concentration. Beeswax was the most influential factor that affected opacity which increased with increasing beeswax concentration. In order to successfully employ these films, their adsorption behavior, thermal and thermomechanical properties were evaluated as a function of moisture content and sorbitol concentration. The adsorption behavior was strongly influenced by sorbitol concentration. Moisture content and sorbitol concentration increased the films elongation at break, but decreased tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and Tg, and increased water vapor permeability of the films. Finally, avocado was coated with a pectin-based film and the associated quality changes were evaluated during storage. From storage studies, kinetic parameters (rate constants) and activation energy were quantified to help model the quality changes in avocado quality as function of storage temperature and time. Pectin-based coating resulted in slowing down the rate of quality changes in avocado at each storage temperature. In general, most changes were well described by some form of zero or first order rate. Temperature sensitivity of rate constant was adequately described by the Arrhenius model. A hyperspectral imaging technique was also used to gather additional tools for following quality changes associated with stored avocados. Artificial neural network (ANN) concepts were evaluated as alternated models for predicting quality changes in coated and non-coated avocados during storage at different temperature. Modeling of quality changes in avocado indicated that compared to conventional mathematical models, ANN has more feasibility to predict of these changes. Models developed for firmness, weight loss and total color difference had better fitness than respiration rate. Finally, the effect of coating on disease severity and different properties of avocados infected by Lasiodiplodia theobromae was studied. The coated fruits demonstrated slower rate of disease progress, respiration rate, softening and color changes. Respiration rate, firmness and color parameters were sensitive to coating and disease severity, and thus these parameters could successfully used to predict fruit quality from disease in coated and uncoated avocados...|$|R
