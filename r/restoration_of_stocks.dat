In {{response to the}} increased need for conservation efforts and <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> of overexploited species, a simple model based on a Geographic Information System using IDRISI software was developed addressing the selection process for determination of potential areas to be considered as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) using biogeographic and habitat representation as a theoretical framework. Presence/absence data for 10 important commercial fishery stocks currently exploited by the fishing industry and a bathymetric map were used as data sources. All species could be represented in a minimum of 12 protected areas as determined by complementarity analysis. We also illustrate the use of spatial multi-criteria evaluation for determining the suitability of additional marine areas. It is hoped {{that the results of}} this study can be used to support definition of different spatial arrangements based on size, shape and distance for a MPA network in order to support the recovery of fishery stocks.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a class of}} problems, which we call “SFQ” problems, in which both stocks and flows can be controlled to promote {{the quality of a}} valued resource, such as environmental quality or public infrastructure. Under the optimal policy, periodic <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> quality complements positive but variable abatement of the flow of damages. When deterioration is more rapid or highly variable, or when abatement is more expensive relative to restoration, the optimal policy relies relatively more on restoration. When deterioration is due to private firms or individuals, a flow tax equal to the present value of marginal damages provides e!cient incentives for abatement. This tax rises at first as quality worsens, but eventually falls as restoration nears. The revenues raised by such a tax approximates the cost <b>of</b> <b>restoration,</b> with the two quantities converging as the variance of flows goes to zero.

40|$|When neurones {{are active}} {{there is an}} entry of Na+, which must {{subsequently}} be pumped out, {{and an increase in}} their oxygen consumption rate (Q o 2). The Na+ pump derives its energy from ATP, splitting it into ADP and Pi, and it has reasonably been proposed that the changes in concentrations of ATP, ADP and Pi lead to a stimulation of the O 2 consumption by the mitochondria and hence to a <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> ATP 1 – 3. Here we present evidence suggesting that Q o 2 must be controlled differently in the retinal photoreceptor cells of the honeybee drone.

We report intracellular recordings of changes in intracellular sodium (Nai +) and potassium (Ki +) in response to single light flashes and have compared the time course of extra oxygen consumption (ΔQ o 2) with these ion changes and other indices of Na+ pumping.

Due to changes in various biotic and abiotic factors we find it important to discuss {{the state of the}} major groups of aquatic biocenosis including algae, crayfish, shrimp, pontogammarus, fish and Caspian seal. Methods. Long-term data has been analyzed on the biology and ecology of the main commercial fish stocks and their projected catches for qualitative and quantitative composition, abundance and biomass of aquatic organisms that make up the food base for fish. Results and discussion. It has been found that the widespread commercial invertebrates in the Caspian Sea are still poorly studied; their stocks are not identified and not used commercially. There is a great concern about {{the current state of the}} main commercial fish <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> the Caspian Sea.

Within each of these clusters, samples collected in continuously inhabited and recently recolonized sites had comparable allelic richness and effective population sizes and were only weakly differentiated. Genetic structure among basins was also similar among continuously inhabited and recently recolonized sites. The majority of the individuals sampled from recently recolonized sites were assigned to neighboring continuously inhabited downstream sites, but noticeable proportions of fish were assigned to samples collected in more distant sites or identified as putative hybrids.

40|$|In central Philippines, the Aquaculture Department of the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center (SEAFDEC/AQD), {{with strong}} {{collaboration}} {{and support from}} the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature (RIHN) of Kyoto, Japan, has been looking into the <b>stock</b> enhancement <b>of</b> tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon in the New Washington Estuary (NWE), province of Aklan, central Philippines. The NWE was a productive fishing ground that has been suffering from degenerating brackishwater fisheries and estuarine environment. Average daily catch declined from 24 kg in 1970 s to only 0. 7 kg at present. Shrimp fisheries, the most important livelihood, declined in quality and quantity. Tiger shrimps were abundant in catch until the early 1990 s when these were observed to decline in volume, replaced by smaller and cheaper species. This was coincidental with the rapid decline in mangrove cover for ponds and huge increase in fishing pressure. It is clear that crucial interventions are required to restore the tiger shrimp fisheries in the NWE {{in order to increase}} income of local fishers, while promoting reduction of fishing gears and <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> mangroves. <b>Stock</b> enhancement <b>of</b> tiger shrimps shows good potential in answering these needs. Site-specific assessments were conducted to evaluate prospects <b>of</b> shrimp <b>stock</b> enhancement in NWE. Conservative simulations of capture <b>of</b> released <b>stocks</b> showed that fishers can increase income by 300 %. To decrease fishing pressure in the area, number of gears per fisher may have to be reduced but shrimp catches will be relatively high-priced. Comparative experiments using aquaculture techniques were done to identify strategies especially in the delicate intermediate acclimation rearing. Aquaculture protocols like those for pond preparation were also adapted to be used in a mangrove pen nursery rearing system for shrimps. Supplemental feeding with formulated feeds increased carrying capacity of the culture area, while enhancing growth and survival <b>of</b> <b>stocks.</b> Culture experiments showed that shrimps grow to 0. 5 g within 1 mo and > 1 g in 2 mo. High <b>stocking</b> density <b>of</b> 40 - 60 shrimps m- 2 can be used for < 2 mo rearing in a mangrove pen. Release experiments showed that 60 -d old shrimps have higher chances of survival when released in the estuaries. With strong support from local communities, government and other sectors, together with effective management and law enforcement, aquaculture-based <b>stock</b> enhancement <b>of</b> tiger shrimps can be a viable intervention to restore livelihood and promote estuarine rehabilitation in the NWE...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background To {{identify}} the biochemical changes induced by sleep deprivation at a proteomic level, {{we compared the}} hippocampal proteome of rats either after 4 hours of sleep or sleep deprivation obtained by gentle handling. Because sleep deprivation might induce some stress, we also analyzed proteomic changes in rat adrenals in the same conditions. After sleep deprivation, proteins from both tissues were extracted and subjected to 2 D-DIGE analysis followed by protein identification through mass spectrometry and database search. Results In the hippocampus, 87 spots showed significant variation between sleep and sleep deprivation, with more proteins showing higher abundance in the latter case. Of these, 16 proteins were present in sufficient amount for a sequencing attempt and among the 12 identified proteins, inferred affected cellular functions include cell metabolism, energy pathways, transport and vesicle trafficking, cytoskeleton and protein processing. Although {{we did not observe}} classical, macroscopic effect of stress in sleep-deprived rats, 47 protein spots showed significant variation in adrenal tissue between sleep and sleep deprivation, with more proteins showing higher abundance following sleep. Of these, 16 proteins were also present in sufficient amount for a sequencing attempt and among the 13 identified proteins, the most relevant cellular function that was affected was cell metabolism. Conclusion At a proteomic level, short term sleep deprivation is characterized by a higher expression of some proteins in the hippocampus and a lower abundance of other proteins in the adrenals (compared to normal sleep control). Altogether, this could indicate a general activation of a number of cellular mechanisms involved in the maintenance of wakefulness and in increased energy expenditure during sleep deprivation. These findings are relevant to suggested functions of sleep like energy repletion and the <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> molecular <b>stocks</b> or a more global homeostasis of synaptic processes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Tropical peatlands store {{approximately}} 14 - 19 % of the world’s peat carbon, with estimates {{ranging from}} 50 - 90 GtC. Southeast Asia contains the largest proportion of tropical peatland {{with an estimated}} 56 % of the tropical peatland area and 77 % of the tropical peat C store. These peatlands have functioned as a globally significant carbon sink for millennia. However they are now being deforested, degraded and converted to other land uses at extremely high rates, switching their function from carbon sink to source. In addition, land use change causes losses of other critical ecosystem services, functions, and biodiversity. The carbon dynamics of tropical peatlands are largely under-studied compared to temperate and boreal peatlands. Comprehensive field studies are scarce, particularly at the ecological time scales required to assess process rates and long-term trends. Therefore, it is informative to use modelling approaches to ascertain long-term carbon dynamics beyond scales of practical observation. Here we use the Tropical Holocene Peat Model (HPMTrop) {{to assess the impact}} of land use change on carbon storage in a hypothetical tropical peat system over decadal time scales. HPMTrop is a processbased dynamic carbon model parameterized and calibrated from existing field data from Southeast Asia. We present peat carbon losses caused by typical trajectories of peatland conversion, and the potential rebalance of the carbon cycle and restored carbon sequestration under possible peatland rewetting and rehabilitation scenarios. Results indicate that although emissions from converted peatlands can be reduced, or even reversed, <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> carbon <b>stocks</b> lost due to conversion is impossible at practical time scales; for example steady C accumulation over hundreds to thousands of years would be necessary to replenish carbon stocks lost over just one rotation of industrial oil palm cultivation, a dominant driver of land use change in the region...|$|R

Recruitment is at a historical low and most recent observations do not indicate recovery. Opportunities for protection and <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> spawner escapement are fading. Earlier reports indicate that anthropogenic factors (e. g. exploitation, habitat loss, contamination and transfer of parasites and diseases) as well as natural processes (e. g. climate change, predation) {{may have contributed to the}} decline. Measures aimed at recovery <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> are well known and may include control of exploitation, restocking <b>of</b> recruits and <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> habitats (including access to and from). Recent research shows that the quality of the spawners escaping from the continent might be seriously impaired by pollution, diseases and parasites. Additionally, the quality of spawners varies with biological characteristics such as size and fat content. None of these quality parameters is currently included in the assessment of the status <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> or in setting management targets. Implementation of basic field sampling programmes, i. a. within the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) and National Management Plans, and further analysis will be required, in order to include quality aspects in future management advice. The objective of recovery <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> necessitates <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> the spawning <b>stock,</b> for which the European Commission has proposed a target of 40 % of the potential production under unfished, unpolluted and unobstructed conditions. Methodology for elaboration of this reference level is described, but actual implementation requires field data and analysis for each spatial management unit. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> dynamics under different fisheries management regimes indicates that recovery times may vary from 20 up to 200 years, depending on the intensity of implemented fisheries restrictions. However, restrictions on fisheries alone will be insufficient, and management measures aimed at other anthropogenic impacts on habitat quality, quantity and accessibility will also be required. The continental population extends throughout Europe and northern Africa and fisheries are scattered over many large and small water bodies, both marine and freshwater. The overall objective will have to be achieved by implementation of protective measures at a regional scale, presumably at the level of River Basin Districts (RBDs as defined for the WFD). The compilation of information on the spatial distribution of the current eel fisheries in this report shows that almost all RBDs will be involved. Spatial differentiation in targets, controls and post-evaluation procedures might facilitate the implementation. Restocking has been practised by some countries for decades, generally to maintain fisheries rather than improve the stock or recruitment. There are concerns over the unknown risks of moving fish between rivers. Restocking may be beneficial to rebuilding the stock, but it is highly unlikely that the 40 % objective will be met in all European river basins in the medium term by restocking alone. Only a combination of several measures can be expected to bring the <b>stock</b> out <b>of</b> its current critical state. The current glass eel catches are probably insufficient to restock inland waters, and any further decline in glass eel recruitment could result in total loss of the option to use restocking as a measure. Recommendations to protect the stock, and suggestions for a forward focus of the work of this group are presented...|$|R

MÉTODOS: De abril de 1999 a janeiro de 2005, foram tratados 49 quadris em pacientes portadores de afrouxamento femoral (39 quadris) ou fratura periprotética do fêmur (10 quadris) com revisão da artroplastia com a prótese de Wagner. O seguimento médio foi de 35 meses e a média de idade, de 63, 4 anos. As revisões do componente femoral foram {{realizadas}} em 49 quadris e, simultaneamente, no componente acetabular em 36 quadris. RESULTADOS: A avaliação dos resultados pelo índice de D'Aubignè-Postel-Charnley apresentou melhora estatisticamente significante no pós-operatório em relação ao pré-operatório (p OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 49 hips in 48 patients {{submitted to}} revision {{total hip arthroplasty}} using Wagner stem. METHODS: From April 1999 to January 2005, 49 hips were treated in patients with femoral loosening (39 hips) or periprosthetic fracture of the femur (10 hips) with revision arthroplasty using the Wagner prosthesis. Mean follow-up lasted 35 months and mean age was 63. 4 years. Revisions of the femoral component were performed in 49 hips, with concomitant acetabular component revision in 36 hips. RESULTS: Results evaluation according to the D'Aubignè-Postel-Charnley index presented a statistically significant improvement in the post-operative period {{in comparison to the}} pre-operative period (p < 0. 001). The most important problems seen were the high rate of dislocations (three hips) and dislocations associated to the deepening of the stem (two hips). The four unsatisfactory results were due to loosening (two hips), infection (one hip), and acetabular loosening (one hip). All of the unsatisfactory results occurred in the group of aseptic loosening, but this finding was not statistically significant (p = 0. 569). <b>Restoration</b> <b>of</b> bone <b>stock</b> (radiographic evaluation) was seen consistently in most cases, without correlation with patient age (p = 0. 852). Likewise, clinical results were not related to patient ages (p = 0. 636). CONCLUSION: The procedure of femoral revision with Wagner prosthesis yields clinical and radiographic satisfactory results and consistently restores femoral bone stock...|$|R
