40|$|In this study, we {{analyzed}} the fish species composition data of coastal capture fisheries in Taiwan between 1963 and 2010. The {{purpose of the}} analysis {{was to understand the}} long-term changes in marine ecosystems. A <b>ratio-to-moving</b> <b>average</b> <b>method</b> was used in conjunction with adjusted seasonal indices to determine the seasonality of individual catch items and to examine the trends shown by the species with the same seasonality. Over the 48 -year timespan of the data, 31 species, i. e., 64 % {{of the total number of}} species, were identified as seasonal migrants. The catch ratio for species showing a single peak in the spring increased steadily over time; however, those species with a single peak in the winter decreased. The catch ratio for those species with dual peaks in both summer and fall varied greatly before 1978. Increasing trends began in the 1980 s and accelerated until 1998. As a result of this increase, the previous concentration of the fishing season in the winter months became highly diffuse. Additionally, the winter and/or spring species continued to decrease year after year as the summer and/or autumn species gradually came to dominate the catch. This change in fishing seasonality is likely not an anthropogenic effect. However, the change coincides with trends in sea surface temperature fluctuations. Such variation may not only cause structural change in marine ecosystems but can also significantly impact the economy and the livelihoods of those associated with the fishing trade...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: A {{statistical}} {{assessment of}} a disease is often necessary before resources can be allocated to any control programme. No literature on seasonal trends of gonorrhoea is available from India. Objectives: The objectives were (1) to determine, if any, seasonal trends were present in India (2) to describe factors contributing to seasonality of gonorrhoea (3) to formulate approaches for gonorrhoea control at the national level. Materials and Methods: Seasonal indices for gonorrhoea were calculated quarterly {{in terms of a}} seasonal index between 2005 and 2010. <b>Ratio-to-moving</b> <b>average</b> <b>method</b> was used to determine the seasonal variation. The original data values in the time-series were expressed as percentages of moving averages. Results were also analyzed by second statistical method i. e. seasonal subseries plot. Results: The seasonally adjusted average for culture-positive gonorrhoea cases was highest in the second quarter (128. 61 %) followed by third quarter (108. 48 %) while a trough was observed in the first (96. 05 %) and last quarter (64. 85 %). The second quarter peak was representative of summer vacations in schools and colleges. Moreover, April is the harvesting month followed by celebrations and social gatherings. Both these factors are associated with increased sexual activity and partner change. A trough in first and last quarter was indicative of festival season and winter leading to less patients reporting to the hospital. Conclusion: The findings highlight the immediate need to strengthen sexual health education among young people in schools and colleges and education on risk-reduction practices especially at crucial points in the calendar year for effective gonorrhoea control...|$|E

40|$|I have {{proposed}} three techniques for three dimensional strain analysis, that is, the orthogonal <b>average</b> <b>method,</b> the oblique <b>average</b> <b>method</b> {{and the least}} square method (Hayashi; 1994, 1995). The orthogonal <b>average</b> <b>method</b> is the simplest technique {{in terms of its}} easiest computer coding and simplicity to prepare input data. In spite of the convenience of the orthogonal <b>average</b> <b>method,</b> there is a difficulty to cut three exactly mutually perpendicular sections from oriented rock samples. The orthogonal <b>average</b> <b>method</b> cannot be used properly unless strain ellipses are obtained from three orthogonal sections. We can calculate the mutually perpendicular planes from any subperpendicular planes of rock samples. Using the newly constructed orthogonal coordinate system and composing the strain ellipses described on the system, the strain ellipsoid can be estimated. I call the technique as "practical average method". The practical <b>average</b> <b>method</b> is useful and the difference between the estimated strain ellipsoids which are calculated by the practical <b>average</b> <b>method</b> and by the least square method is conveniently small, if the difference between the original oblique axes and the newly constructed orthogonal axes are less than 10 ° and c value is less than 0. 1 in the case of strain analysis on the Kayo sandstone (Hayashi; 1988, 1989) ...|$|R

40|$|Application of {{appropriate}} spatial averaging techniques {{is crucial to}} correct evaluation of ocean color radiometric data, due to the common log-normal or mixed log-normal distribution of these data. <b>Averaging</b> <b>method</b> is particularly crucial for data acquired in coastal regions. The effect of <b>averaging</b> <b>method</b> was markedly demonstrated for a precipitation-driven event on the U. S. Northeast coast in October-November 2005, which resulted in export of high concentrations of riverine colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) to New York and New Jersey coastal waters {{over a period of}} several days. Use of the arithmetic mean <b>averaging</b> <b>method</b> created an inaccurate representation of the magnitude of this event in SeaWiFS global mapped chl a data, causing it to be visualized as a very large chl a anomaly.

40|$|In this paper, the {{validity}} of the state-space <b>averaging</b> <b>method</b> is analyzed. We assume that the state-space piecewise method is an exact model for a fast switching circuit. Based on this model, we compute the error predicted by the state-space <b>averaging</b> <b>method.</b> It is found that the error for a polynomial input is bounded by two polynomials with the same order as that of the input. And the percentage error is bounded by a constant. Hence, if the acceptable level is within that constant, then the state-space <b>averaging</b> <b>method</b> can be applied. Similar analysis is carried out on a non-polynomial input. A sinusoidal function is chosen because of its wide applications on AC circuits. Although a similar result is obtained, the percentage error for the sinusoidal input is much greater than that of the polynomial input. Hence, the state-space <b>averaging</b> <b>method</b> may not be so good for the AC analysis...|$|R
