50|$|In a Vodou home, often, {{the only}} {{recognizable}} religious items are images of saints and candles with a rosary. In other homes, where people may more openly show their {{devotion to the}} spirits, noticeable items may include an altar with Catholic saints and iconographies, rosaries, bottles, jars, rattles, perfumes, oils, and dolls. Some Vodou devotees have less paraphernalia in their homes because until recently Vodou practitioners had {{no option but to}} hide their beliefs. Haiti is a rural society and the cult of ancestors guard the traditional values of the peasant class. The ancestors are linked to family life and the land. Haitian peasants serve the spirits daily and sometime gather with their extended family on special occasions for ceremonies, which may celebrate the birthday of a spirit or a particular event. In very remote areas, people may walk for days to partake in ceremonies that take place as often as several times a month. Vodou is closely tied to the division and administration of land {{as well as to the}} <b>residential</b> <b>economy.</b> The cemeteries and many crossroads are meaningful places for worship: the cemetery acts as a repository of spirits and the crossroads acts as points of access to the world of the invisible.|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{regional development}} theories {{are based on}} those activities whose export outside of the region drives local development. The increasing mobility of the workforce and resident population has changed the relevance of this approach. In fact, residency can also become pivotal to incomes within a region. This is {{what is known as}} the <b>residential</b> <b>economy.</b> Based on this distinction, this article classifies the various regions of Switzerland according to three models: productive (based on income from exporting activities), residential (based on income from residents, whether this income derives from work, private wealth or annuities), or a combination thereof. In order to determine this, we have created two intensity indicators for both activities and incomes, thereby enabling us to compile a spatial typology breakdown using a Hierarchical Ascendant Classification (HAC) system. The results demonstrate that the <b>residential</b> <b>economy</b> plays an essential role in attracting high-income residents...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the way in}} which the main economic activities combine locally highlights the growing presence in rural employment of economic activities designed to satisfy the needs of local people, activities which constitute the basis of a <b>residential</b> <b>economy.</b> Agriculture and the sectors directly linked to it are now relatively insignificant and have been overtaken by the industrial sectors. Thus, while in 1980 only a third of the living basins centred around a market town or small city had more residential jobs than agricultural and industrial jobs, in 1999 more than half were in this position. During the period, basins with a <b>residential</b> <b>economy</b> experienced more favourable economic development than basins with a more industrial or agricultural character. Furthermore, all other things being equal, employment growth was more marked in basins close to large urban centres, the local demographic dynamic having a positive influence on the development of economic activity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Identifying {{different}} economic zones {{within the}} city from remotely sensed data is essential for urban planning. We attempt {{to address the problem}} using distribution of Vegetation, Impervious surface, and Soil (VIS) fractions as a proxy variable. We focus on using the VIS distribution as a signature instead of using each fraction independently. Preliminary results are encouraging and show the potential of this approach. Spectral angles between mean vectors of the low <b>economy</b> <b>residential</b> — the industrial, the high <b>economy</b> <b>residential</b> — the industrial, and the low — the high <b>economy</b> <b>residential</b> classes are 46 o, 50 o, and 34 o respectively. Clusters using the VIS fractions feature are cohesive and indicate a particular economic zone. The clusters with VIS features show a marked improvement in identification of economic zones over a supervised classification using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMagali Talandier {{begins by}} {{outlining}} {{the importance of}} the <b>residential</b> <b>economy</b> for the local development of territories. She looks at the question {{at the heart of this}} working group’s thinking: “what future is there for the processes of residential and tourist development that are based on the capture of wealth created elsewhere, by virtue of the disconnect between sites of production and sites of consumption?”Four possible answers have been identified, corresponding to the four scenarios outlined here: “Oases, Urban Domes, Rural Domes” (the scenario involving rootedness in the territory and reduced mobility, against a background of a service-oriented economy); “Spheres of Life or Functional Specialization” (the scenario of the local <b>residential</b> <b>economy</b> in which individuals move from one functional sphere to another with a cautious mobility, but an extension of peri-urban spaces); “Spots or Network Mobility” (combining mobility, fluidity and functional multiplicity of places, against a background of hypermobility and the loss of territorial cohesion); and, lastly, the “Web” or A-territorialization scenario (reduced movement, with multiple, but essentially virtual relationships to places) that marks the end of the <b>residential</b> <b>economy</b> and presents serious risks for social cohesion. Lastly, Magali Talandier details the contribution made by this group’s work on two major issues for DATAR: the quality of territories for a mobile society and the organization of networks and time. En quelques années, l’économie résidentielle s’est imposée comme l’une des problématiques qui compte en matière de développement territorial. Les travaux et controverses sur le sujet se multiplient, que ce soit à l’initiative d’élus, de techniciens, d’experts, de chercheurs français ou étrangers. Basé sur le développement non productif des territoires, ce type d’économie représente aujourd’hui l’un des premiers moteurs du développement local. C’est dans ce contexte que la Datar a choisi d’inclure cette thématique parmi les sept systèmes territoriaux de la prospective « Territoires 2040 ». Cet article s’appuie sur les travaux du groupe de prospective « systèmes territoriaux à base économie résidentielle et touristique » présidé par Bernard Pecqueur dont les premiers résultats ont été publiés dans la revue Territoires 2040 (Pecqueur, Talandier, 2011 a et 2011 b) ...|$|E
40|$|LAS (Localised Agri-food Systems) {{approach}} has been viewed until now as either an analysis {{of a variety of}} local production system or an anthropological vision of the links between food and places. Although theses approaches are relevant, they prove sometimes hard to differentiate themselves of close concepts such as Local production systems. This paper intends to assess in what measure LAS approach can be redefined as an approach of rural development processes, which could be the basis of a rural development policy. If LAS's are to be considered as the basis of a rural development path, LAS approach must be cast in the current debate on diversification of rural activities. Drawing on that, LAS can be the basis of a rural development policy, but only fit to some places, with a very specific “residential” relationship with the overall economic environment.

For the categorization of data on number of employees in the activities defined in the Standard Classification of Activities (SDK) we implemented the template used in the ESPON TOWN project (2014). We classified data into the following categories: <b>residential</b> <b>economy</b> (D), productive economy (P), and knowledge economy (U). The data on number of employees in the municipalities of Slovenia for individual years in the period 2000 – 2013 according to the SKD 2008 classification was acquired from the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia (SURS). We performed analysis for 192 municipalities {{from the beginning of}} the period under consideration (2000). The analysis of economic structure and changes in economic structure was executed in Microsoft Excel. The results were prepared using ArcGIS and displayed on thematic maps. Separately, we analysed the economic profile of 15 urban centres of national importance and its dynamics (Spatial Development Strategy of Slovenia, 2004). We established that in the analysed period the economy in Slovenia has changed radically, as productive economy is decreasing in extent while residential and knowledge economies are expanding...|$|E

In the history of the financing <b>residential</b> <b>economy</b> we are trying to determine legal basis arranging financing, basic characteristics of financing, loaning and institutions which have a leading role in financing in certain periods of history. Residential politicy in Slovenia went through different periods and it always reflected the influence of economical and political systems during these periods. All important milestones for residential domain in Slovenia are consequences of structural changes in politics and economy. In detail we are focused on today's different sources of financing, from traditional residential loan and mortgage loan to leasing. Traditional residential loans are widely used but lately they are replaced by currently more favourable mortgage loans. In the diploma work is shown the comparison of different calculations of loan and leasing. The government is also stimulating apartment purchase with the residential fund of the Republic of Slovenia with The national residential saving scheme, subsidies to support young families in resolving their first housing problems and residential loaning of fund.

40|$|Conference Proceedings: At {{the frontiers}} of Urban Space [URL] [Collection : Actes Avignon -ISBN : 978 2 9105 4509 1]Even though the {{economic}} situation of small and medium-sized towns (SMSTs) is diverse across European regions and countries, we argue that three major socio-economic profiles of local economy {{can be observed in}} SMSTs. The first profile is a SMST with a dominant 'residential' economy that mostly relies on local activities that meet the needs of people in an area, be they residents, commuters or tourists. The second profile corresponds to a town with a dominant 'productive' economy based on production of goods and services to be exported and consumed out of its area. The third profile is the one with important share of activities in the 'creative-knowledge' economy that is based on entrepreneurship, creativity and knowledge, and on networks and collaboration in innovation. Furthermore, we suggest that profiles are shifting as SMSTs are making choices between <b>residential</b> <b>economy,</b> competitiveness and innovation. As a result, better performance of SMSTs in terms of positive demographic change and job growth is underpinned by a combination of crucial factors: proximity to a large city (access to bigger market), performance of their wider region, skilled resident active population, numerous existing local businesses, etc. By observing and analysing socio-economic dynamics in 30 European towns, this paper seeks to contribute to a scientific discussion on importance of SMSTs for the future development of European territory...|$|E
40|$|In {{developing}} countries, {{the contribution}} of the growing amount of migrant remittances to development remains an unsettled issue. At the macroeconomic level remittances do represent an external flow way above official aid and often in line with FDI. Hence the widely shared optimistic view about this until now "hidden source of development finance". At the microeconomic level remittances raise incomes and have an impact on consumption expenses and therefore on welfare. They can also finance investment in productive assets, such as physical capital and more conspicuously, human capital through education and health expenses. They can therefore improve the resilience of concerned household livelihoods, although it is not granted that remittances necessarily accrue to the poorest households. Remittances on the whole have an impact on poverty abatement but this impact can vary widely. At the meso-economic level relevant data show that migration and remittances concentrate in specific place, raising the issue of their contribution to local development of concerned areas. Concerning the impact of productive investments financed by remittances, picture is rather contrasted with contradictory results from various case-studies. Staying at the meso level, we will compare in this paper two models which have been used, albeit tentatively, to assess {{the contribution of}} remittances to local development. - Dutch disease approach, in its sub-national version which features the impact of remittances on real exchange rate. - <b>Residential</b> <b>economy</b> approach which rest on the use of a Keynesian export multiplier applied at an area level to an "economic base" which can be productive but also residential, remittances being considered as a component of this residential basis. These two approaches predict changes in the system of activities due to remittances. However their vision of the consequences of these changes diverge. Their comparative analysis can allow for the identification of key factors of remittance capability to shape a local development path. To achieve that, we shall draw from the huge literature on remittances relating to various countries as well as public statistical data bases...|$|E

40|$|Like most {{developed}} countries, France {{is concerned}} by repopulation of its rural areas since the 1970 - 1980 s. Analyses of census population data 2006 confirm it, and present positive dynamics far away of cities in remote country districts. These places symbolised archaism and social confinement. Today, {{they represent a}} new way of life for many heterogeneous populations, who are going to live there for familial motives, environment or economic reasons. The urban-rural migrations clearly represent main processes of sociodemographic changes in French countrysides, and in many international contexts (1). Rural gentrification is a form of migration towards rural areas, undertaken by populations of middle and upper classes from cities. They participate in deep transformations of demographic, socioeconomic and housing structures, which have been first analysed in British cases (2). Can we identify same processes in French countrysides? According to life course analyses (3), French's rural areas are also characterized by high proportion of older and retired, living and coming in country districts. What part do they play in repopulation of rural areas, mainly high incomes? Which places are particularly concerned? We propose quantitative statistical and cartographic treatments, to analyse interactions between processes of rural gentrification and ageing. We use several data resources (sociodemographic, income, housing) on whole France, with small geographic scales and aggregated areas, to realise spatial analyses of urban-rural relations and intra-rural. Our research is part of works on rural <b>residential</b> <b>economy</b> (4), in context of post-productive countryside.

For this reason {{it is difficult to}} predict birth distribution in a prehistoric context. Birth seasonality of prehistoric sheep from the site of Kasteelberg, South Africa, was investigated by high resolution intra-tooth analysis of enamel oxygen isotope ratios. The results show two birth seasons, probably in autumn and spring. This may reflect females lambing more than once a year, or subdivision of the flock into groups where births were scheduled at different times of the year.

40|$|Despite its {{recognized}} {{economic and}} social importance, housing finance often remains underdevelopedin emerging <b>economies.</b> <b>Residential</b> lending remains small, poorly accessible, and depository-based. Lenders remain vulnerable to significant credit, liquidity, and interest rate risks. As a result, housing finance is relatively expensive and often rationed. The importance of developing robust systems of housing finance is paramount as emerging economy governments struggle to cope with population growth, rapid urbanization, and rising expectations from a growing middle class. The capital markets in many economies can provide an attractive and potentially large source of long-term funding for housing, and solutions to better allocate part of the risks. The advent of institutional investors is creating large and rapidly growing pools of funds that may facilitate the development of mortgage-related securities. Despite such a strong appeal, there are significant barriers {{to the development of}} mortgage securities in emerging markets. Their success is dependent on many factors, starting with a strong legal and regulatory framework and liberalized financial sector, and including a developed primary mortgage market. The experience in developing mortgage securities in emerging markets has been mixed. The authors review the experience of introducing mortgage securities in emerging markets and explore the policy issues related to this theme.
