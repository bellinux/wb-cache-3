The mechanism at hand is twofold. (a) First the rent extracted by the most efficient bank distorts incentives of entrepreneurs to undertake efforts. (b) Second banks specialising on contracts that do not include monitoring feature less cyclical fluctuations of aggregate lending. This has clear implications: (i) the presence of banking heterogeneity decreases firms' average productivity as it increases adverse selection by entrepreneurs as well as favours <b>rent</b> <b>extractions</b> by banks; (ii) an individual bank featuring a lower cyclicality signals a lower efficiency in its monitoring abilities; (iii) a heterogeneous banking system featuring a lower cyclicality of aggregate lending might not be desirable as it may come along with allocative and incentives distortions...|$|R

40|$|High {{levels of}} {{executive}} pay in the USA and the UK have attracted journalistic and academic criticism {{to the effect}} that they constitute <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> by self-interested executives rather than rewards for raising shareholder returns. The focus of most criticism has been on salary, severance payments and various long-term incentives (particularly share options). However, executive bonuses have attracted little attention and have been only lightly regulated. This raises important questions. Has lighter regulation been associated with significant levels of <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> through bonuses, that is, a weak relation between bonus pay and shareholder returns? Have more transparent performance conditions attached to bonuses strengthened the relation, making <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> more difficult, or have they acted as camouflage for <b>rent</b> <b>extraction,</b> associated with higher bonus pay but lower pay-performance responsiveness? Are measures of CEO power associated with larger bonuses? This empirical note provides the first, preliminary answers to these questions.

In our model, the union leadership makes a choice between {{the two types of}} activities, and we demonstrate why it is optimal to engage in both: <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> increases the bargained wage rate, rent creation secures higher employment. More importantly, the choice between the two activities depends systematically on the economic and regulatory environment in which the union operates. Unions operating in an environment of intense market competition are mainly engaged in <b>rent</b> <b>extraction.</b> Our model thus suggests that the economic and regulatory environment is an important determinant of “what unions do”, and that changes/differences in this environment can explain changes/differences in union behaviour across time and space. unions, rent creation, <b>rent</b> <b>extraction,</b> product market competition...|$|E
40|$|Managerial <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> is a non-trivial {{phenomenon}} during acquisitions: in {{a sample}} of 364 deals from 1999 - 2005, over one target CEO in four experiences compensation increases due to option grants received just before the acquisition while target shareholders suffer losses. Indeed, the top quartile of <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> CEOs pocket an average of 19 million dollars from option awards granted several months prior to the acquisition while shareholders of <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> targets experience average abnormal returns of- 22 percent during the three years ending just after the merger announcement. <b>Rent</b> <b>extraction</b> occurs in weakly governed companies.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the efficiency of}} the Price Cap regulatory scheme and its impact on universal access, when the monopolist is allowed to set a menu of alternative plans as part of a self-selection strategy (second-degree price discrimination) and the cap is calculated as the weighted average of the tariff plans he offers. In this context, we characterized the solution of the monopolist; who, besides offering a menu of plans more distorted than the second-best outcome -even distorting the plan for high-valuation consumers- because the trade-off between efficiency and <b>rents</b> <b>extraction</b> is exhibited in different way, can exclude consumers who {{are willing to pay for}} the service -shutdown policy- despite of universal access obligation have been imposed by the regulator. This happens regardless of the weighted average price cap (WAPC) set by the regulator. Consequently, if the Price Cap regulatory scheme is going to be used by the regulator, this mechanism must be applied to a single regulated plan, leaving the monopolist some flexibility to offer alternative plans that will be incentive compatible with this single regulated plan (tariff flexibility). ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an account}} of the role and significance of <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> in executive compensation. Under the optimal contracting view of executive compensation, which has dominated academic research on the subject, pay arrangements are set by a board of directors that aims to maximize shareholder value by designing an optimal principal-agent contract. Under the alternative <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> view that we examine, the board does not operate at arm’s length; rather, executives have power to influence their own compensation, and they use their power to extract rents. As a result, executives are paid more than is optimal for shareholders and, to camouflage the extraction of rents, executive compensation might be structured suboptimally. The presence of <b>rent</b> <b>extraction,</b> we argue, is consistent both with the processes that produce compensation schemes and with the market forces and constraints that companies face. Examining the large body of empirical work on executive compensation, we show that the picture emerging from it is largely compatible with the <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> view. Indeed, <b>rent</b> <b>extraction,</b> and the desire to camouflage it, can better explain many puzzling features of compensation patterns and practices. We conclude that extraction of rents might well {{play a significant role in}} U. S. executiv...|$|E
40|$|Why {{is there}} {{significant}} variation in <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> amongst high-income democracies? A {{large number of}} political economy investigations into this research question have found that {{a long period of}} democratic rule and high per capita income are associated with less <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> amongst public policy-makers. However, attempts to explain the residual, yet significant, variation in <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> amongst countries that possess both these characteristics have been significantly more circumspect and disputed. The thesis explores how the distribution of policy-making responsibilities between electorally accountable decision-makers (EDD) and their electorally unaccountable (NEDD) public policy-making counterparts, determines the optimal level of rents extracted in any given high-income democracy context. Specifically, the thesis formally models how: (1) variation in the EDD/NEDD ratio, by altering (2) voters’ evaluation of incumbent competency, changes (3) the incentives that policy-makers, wishing to remain in office, have to minimize their short term level of <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> in order to signal their competency and hopefully retain office. Given these ‘career concerns’ the theoretical model predicts that an increase or decrease in the EDD/NEDD ratio will be associated with more or less <b>rent</b> <b>extraction.</b> This hypothesis is then tested empirically, primarily using an augmented version of Persson and Tabellini’s (2003) dataset. Specifically, the thesis tests whether (1) the EDD/NEDD ratio can predict variation in <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> only amongst high-income democracies; (2) whether voters, and not just elites, use the EDD/NEDD ratio to update their beliefs regarding the determinants of rent extraction; and (3) whether the EDD/NEDD ratio affects the level of <b>rent</b> <b>extraction,</b> once controlling for other institutional variables (Efficacy of Elections) also associated with variation in voter evaluation of incumbents’ competency. Establishing that the EDD/NEDD ratio does robustly predict variation in <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> is a significant finding, as it can enable analysts to predict how changes in policy-making contexts may affect the incentive for good governance in this sub-set of countries. However, the results are (1) exploratory in nature, and also (2) contingent on other factors (regime type and institutional variation), meaning that while significant, they cannot be generalized to non-democratic contexts.

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} state judiciary presence on <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> in Brazilian local governments. We measure rents as irregularities related to waste or corruption uncovered by auditors. Our unique dataset {{at the level of}} individual inspections allows us to separately examine extensive and intensive margins of <b>rent</b> <b>extraction.</b> The identification strategy is based on an institutional rule of state judiciary branches according to which prosecutors and judges tend to be assigned to the most populous among contiguous counties forming a judiciary district. Our research design exploits this rule by comparing counties that are largest in their district to counties with identical population size from other districts in the same state, where they are not the most populous. IV estimates suggest that state judiciary presence reduces the share of inspections with irregularities related to waste or corruption by about 10 percent or 0. 3 standard deviations. In contrast, we find no effect on the intensive margin of <b>rent</b> <b>extraction.</b> Finally, our estimates suggest that judicial presence reduces <b>rent</b> <b>extraction</b> only for first-term mayors.
