50|$|Use of {{personal}} protective equipment, including {{items such as}} protective gloves, protective aprons, acid suits, safety goggles, a face shield, or safety shoes, is normally recommended when handling corrosive substances. Users should consult a safety data sheet for the specific recommendation for the corrosive substance of interest. The material of construction of the personal protective equipment is of critical importance as well. For example, although rubber gloves and <b>rubber</b> <b>aprons</b> may be made out of a chemically resistant elastomer such as nitrile rubber, neoprene, or butyl rubber, each of these materials has different resistance to different corrosives and {{they should not be}} substituted for each other.|$|R
5000|$|Some wheat headers, called [...] "draper" [...] headers, use {{a fabric}} or <b>rubber</b> <b>apron</b> {{instead of a}} cross auger. Draper headers allow faster feeding than cross augers, leading to higher {{throughputs}} due to lower power requirements. On many farms, platform headers are used to cut wheat, instead of separate wheat headers, so as to reduce overall costs.|$|E
50|$|If {{a person}} is {{suspected}} as having died from anthrax, precautions {{should be taken to}} avoid skin contact with the potentially contaminated body and fluids exuded through natural body openings. The body should be put in strict quarantine. A blood sample should then be collected and sealed in a container and analyzed in an approved laboratory to ascertain if anthrax is the cause of death. Then, the body should be incinerated. Microscopic visualization of the encapsulated bacilli, usually in very large numbers, in a blood smear stained with polychrome methylene blue (McFadyean stain) is fully diagnostic, though culture of the organism is still the gold standard for diagnosis. Full isolation of the body is important to prevent possible contamination of others. Protective, impermeable clothing and equipment such as rubber gloves, <b>rubber</b> <b>apron,</b> and rubber boots with no perforations should be used when handling the body. No skin, especially if it has any wounds or scratches, should be exposed. Disposable personal protective equipment is preferable, but if not available, decontamination can be achieved by autoclaving. Disposable personal protective equipment and filters should be autoclaved, and/or burned and buried. B. anthracis bacilli range from 0.5-5.0 μm in size. Anyone working with anthrax in a suspected or confirmed person should wear respiratory equipment capable of filtering this size of particle or smaller. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health - and Mine Safety and Health Administration-approved high-efficiency respirator, such as a half-face disposable respirator with a high-efficiency particulate air filter, is recommended. All possibly contaminated bedding or clothing should be isolated in double plastic bags and treated as possible biohazard waste. The infected person should be sealed in an airtight body bag. Dead people who are opened and not burned provide an ideal source of anthrax spores. Cremating people is the preferred way of handling body disposal. No embalming or autopsy should be attempted without a fully equipped biohazard laboratory and trained, knowledgeable personnel.|$|E
40|$|A {{peripheral}} rim {{of activity}} {{seen on the}} prone vertex view of cerebral flow studies is demonstrated to be an artifact caused by sec ondary radiation arising from the skull. Our routine brain-imaging protocol includes a dynamic cerebral perfusion study in the vertex view. With the patient in the prone position, the head is extended and the chin supported on a sponge block so that the orbitomeatal line is as parallel with the stretcher as possible and parallel to the crystal of the gamma camera. The thorax and shoulders of the patient are shielded by a cape made from a lead <b>rubber</b> <b>apron,</b> 0. 5 mm lead equivalent, with a hole for close fit around the neck. The patient's arms are extended in front to support himself on the dorsum of his arms exposing the antecubital vein for injec tion of the bolus of 15 mC...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to measure the average fetal dose arising from {{computed}} tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in early pregnancy, and to determine the level of fetal dose reduction afforded {{by the use of}} external lead shielding. Using an ART anthropomorphic phantom as a simulated patient, TLDs were inserted at appropriate depths for fetal dose measurement. The fetal dose for the standard scan protocol used locally was measured as 211. 718. 8 Gy for a 64 -slice Siemens Somatom Sensation CT scanner. Comparisons of measured TLD fetal doses with uterus dose values calculated by ImPACT Monte Carlo dosimetry software found that the modelled doses underestimated direct measurements by as much as 90 %, suggesting this software should be used cautiously when estimating the magnitude and risks associated with fetal irradiation during CTPA. The effectiveness of external lead apron shielding for fetal dose optimisation purposes was investigated by determining the fetal dose for various different positions and thicknesses of radiographer lead <b>rubber</b> <b>aprons.</b> The measured dose saving was found to vary linearly with the degree of phantom surface coverage, with a 56. 0 % reduction in fetal dose achieved whe...|$|R
5|$|To avoid a {{potentially}} vigorous chemical reaction, barium metal {{is kept in}} an argon atmosphere or under mineral oils. Contact with air is dangerous and may cause ignition. Moisture, friction, heat, sparks, flames, shocks, static electricity, and exposure to oxidizers and acids should be avoided. Anything that may contact with barium should be electrically grounded. Anyone who works with the metal should wear pre-cleaned non-sparking shoes, flame-resistant rubber clothes, <b>rubber</b> gloves, <b>apron,</b> goggles, and a gas mask. Smoking in the working area is forbidden. Thorough washing is required after handling barium.|$|R
5000|$|The CRC Press {{was founded}} as the Chemical Rubber Company (CRC) in 1903 by {{brothers}} Arthur, Leo and Emanuel Friedman in Cleveland, Ohio, {{based on an}} earlier enterprise by Arthur, who had begun selling <b>rubber</b> laboratory <b>aprons</b> in 1900. The company gradually expanded to include sales of laboratory equipment to chemists. In 1913 the CRC offered a short (116-page) manual called the Rubber Handbook as an incentive for any purchase of a dozen aprons. [...] Since then the Rubber Handbook has evolved into the CRC's flagship book, the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics.|$|R

40|$|General Information Thick {{pieces of}} wood, such as logs or boards, cannot be {{bleached}} satisfactorily {{all the way}} through. Wood should be made into the furniture or other find product, and then the surface bleached if desired Woods differ in {{the ease with which}} they can be bleached. Oak, birch, mahogany, ash, maple, beech, and walnut can be bleached fairly easily gum, tupelo, pine, and poplar are said {{to be very difficult to}} bleach satisfactorily. If varnish, stain, or other finishing material is present on wood surface that is to be bleached, it must be removed completely before bleaching is started. Even waxy materials left on the wood by varnish removers may interfere with the action of bleaching chemicals. A final sanding before bleaching is desirable in such cases. Where stain has penetrated into the wood, scraping or sanding until all of the stained wood has been removed is usually necessary. The wood bleaches may not bleach the dyes or pigments used in wood stains. Many bleaching chemicals are injurious to the skin and eyes. Goggles, heavy <b>rubber</b> gloves, and <b>aprons</b> should be worn when handling and applying wood bleaches, particularly those containing hydrogen peroxide or sodium hydroxide. Reasons for Bleaching Woods such as walnut or mahogany, which are naturally dark in color, may be bleached to a lighter color or even to white, and light-colored woods may be made lighter, in conformity with the vogue for light-colored, or blond, furniture. 1 Only a Iimited amount of experimental work on the bleaching of wood has been done at the Forest Products Laboratory. The information presented here is based chiefly on the published literature and on materiaI suppIied by makers and users of wood bleaches. This Researc...|$|R
