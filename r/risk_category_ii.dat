40|$|Carbon- 11 -methoxyprogabidic acid (11 C-MPGA) was {{recently}} syn-thetized {{as a possible}} ligand for PET studies of gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) receptors in the brain. The data for human absorbed dose estimates are calculated based on the biodistribu-tion of 11 C-MPGA in mice and humans. Methods: Eighteen mice were killed at preset time intervals after an intravenous bolus injection of 3. 7 MBq (100 /nCi) 11 C-MPGA. Time-activity curves were reconstructed for several organs. Three healthy men each had whole-body PET scans after an intravenous bolus injection of 37 MBq (1 mCi) to determine activity in the critical organs. Animal data were fitted into these human findings to calculate residence times, and the MIRDOSE 3 protocol was {{used to calculate the}} radiation absorbed dose. Results: Animal studies demonstrated a rapid distribution of 11 C-MPGA in several organs. The highest activity was detected in the intestines, liver and kidneys. Brain activity was low throughout compared to these organs. The human whole-body study yielded similar results, with the intestines, liver and kidneys showing the highest activity. The estimated dose to the urinary bladder compartment turned out to be significant. The mean effec tive dose was 4. 8 /j. Sv/MBq (s. d. = 0. 5 Â¿iSv/MBq). Conclusion: PET studies using 185 MBq (5 mCi) 11 C-MPGA are within the Interna tional Commission on Radiological Protection <b>risk</b> <b>Category</b> <b>II</b> for healthy volunteers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – In San Francisco {{and other}} urban centers, {{developers}} are increasingly choosing con-crete ductile core designs {{for their new}} high-rise projects (most are more than 160 feet in height and many are upwards of 40 stories). Many of these new designs incorporate only a single system for resisting lateral seismic loading. is design approach {{has not yet been}} tested by a significant earthquake in the western United States. For instance, the August 24, 2014 Napa earthquake (M 6. 0) generated peak ground acceleration on the order of three percent gravity (or less) at ground zero for San Francisco’s relatively new concrete ductile core high-rises, nowhere near the level of ground acceleration expected in DBE or MCE earthquakes with epicenters inside 15 miles of ground zero. ASCE 7 provides guidance to the developer when threshold seismic performance tar-gets are selected, specifying appropriate “Risk Categories ” and “Importance Factors”. When the expected occupancy use is residential, most owners and structural designers use <b>Risk</b> <b>Category</b> <b>II,</b> with an Importance Factor of 1. 00. In contrast, when the structure is expected to be used as an office building, many owners and structural designers use Risk Category III, with an Importance Factor of 1. 25. Using Risk Category III and an Importance Factor of 1. 25 for new high-rise resi-dential projects employing the concrete ductile core design approach should increase the seismic resiliency and simultaneously reduce the owner’s legal risk profile because of expected improved seismic performance in DBE and MCE events. Taking into account the extra costs of construction, adhering to Risk Category III design criteria should yield substantial long-term benefits for owners of these high-rises and help to manage their seismic risk in the legal arena...|$|E

40|$|Background: The use of risk {{modelling}} in blood safety is increasing getting momentum. NBSZ initiated blood donor risk profiling based on donation frequency (r-coding) since 1994 and in 2006 a generic risk classification model was developed (include age and donation venue) which was mainly based on HIV risk considerations. The blood safety {{implications of this}} model, which include all the four routinely tested transfusion transmission infections (TTI) has not been studied. We aim to assess whether the use of HIV as a primary risk indicator is sufficient in Zimbabwe and the possible blood safety concerns for this. Methods: Blood donor data on HIV, HBV, HCV and Syphilis from 2002 to 2011 was analysed. The NBSZ blood donor risk model developed in 2006, which has four levels [RC I (lower) - RC IV (higher) ] of blood safety, was evaluated based on the TTIs seroprevalence results. The TTIs relative risk (RR) for usable (RC I and II) and unusable (RC III and IV) were determined and 95 % CI determined. Sub-group analysis by gender was also done to aid in explaining the results. Results: A total of 627, 072 donations were analysed. The overall TTIs seroprevalence by donor risk category are shown in Table 1. NBSZ donor risk classification seems to be performing well for all TTIs except for HBV, which has highest seroprevalence in RC II. The overall relative risk (RR) for TTIs in risk categories for unusable units over usable units is 3. 5 (95 % CI, 3. 3 - 3. 8), 1. 3 (1. 2 - 1. 3), 1. 3 (1. 1 - 1. 5) and 2. 1 (1. 9 - 2. 4) for HIV, HBV, HCV and Syphilis respectively. The average RR in all risk categories for males being TTI positive compared to females is 0. 70, 1. 95, 1. 6 and 1. 2 for HIV, HBV, HCV and Syphilis respectively. [TABLE PRESENTED] Discussion and conclusions: The results for HIV, HCV and Syphilis indicate increasing safety concerns from low (RC I) to high (RC II) as we expect the model to perform. However, the high HBV seroprevalence in RC II is of concern to blood safety as these are usable blood units. Further analysis also noted that in <b>risk</b> <b>category</b> <b>II,</b> which is mainly composed of new donors in schools, the HBV risk is 68 % higher when compared with other combined risk categories. Males are 95 %, 60 % and 20 % {{more likely to be}} positive for HBV, HCV and Syphilis than females. However, they are 30 % less likely to be HIV positive when compared to female donors. In conclusion, our results points to blood safety concerns for HBV in Zimbabwe and hence there is need to review the current NBSZ blood donor risk classification model taking into consideration other TTIs and cost-effectiveness analysis...|$|E
40|$|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), {{also know}} as prion diseases, {{represent}} {{a group of}} fatal neurodegenerative disorders in humans and several free-ranging and captive mammalian species. A report of scrapie in mouflon from England {{and the fact that}} Germany’s free-ranging mouflon population is the second largest in the world raised the question if mouflon in Germany are affected by TSEs. Therefore, the aim of this survey was (1) to examine the prevalence of prion diseases in mouflon from Germany, and (2) to determine the genetic susceptibility of the populations. Thus a population screening for prion diseases and a sequence analysis of the prion protein gene (PRNP) were carried out. According to the results, a detailed risk assessment was aimed for. All administrative districts in Germany were divided into risk categories defined by the number of reported scrapie cases in domestic sheep, the number of hunted mouflon per year, and the abundance of sheep. Screening included districts of risk categories III and II where the probability to discover TSEs in mouflon was highest. Mouflon ewes and rams older than 18 months collected from hunting bags during the hunting seasons 2006 / 2007 and 2007 / 2008 were sampled. In order to detect classical and atypical scrapie cases, samples were taken from brain stem, cerebellum and retropharyngeal lymph nodes. The samples were analysed by an accredited laboratory using a highly sensitive rapid test (IDEXX HerdChek BSE-scrapie). Mouflon of all screening districts were chosen at random for PRNP genotyping. Brain tissue samples were used for DNA extraction and subsequent PCR amplification and sequencing of an 862 base pair long DNA fragment. All sequences received were compared with gene bank submissions of sheep and mouflon and translated into their amino acid sequences. Focus was the 771 base pair long prion protein coding sequence, especially codons 136, 154, and 171, since these are associated to TSE susceptibility. A total of 2. 453 tissue samples of 823 mouflon from 39 administrative districts were analysed. Protease resistant prion protein (PrPSc) was not detected in any of the examined brain and lymph node samples; all mouflon were TSE negative. All samples from districts of the same risk category were pooled for further analysis and estimation of the detection limits with a probability of 95 percent. TSE prevalence in adult mouflon during the sample period was less than 0. 56 % in districts of risk category III and 1. 2 % in districts of <b>risk</b> <b>category</b> <b>II.</b> Genotyping of the PRNP sequence of 246 mouflon was performed. The sequence-based analysis showed that all tested mouflon carried the same ARQ/ARQ genotype. Thus the genotype is independent of the geographic origin and appears to reflect naturalisation history. Accordingly, it can be assumed that ARQ/ARQ is the only existing genotype in mouflon in Germany. This study represents the most comprehensive survey on TSE and prion protein genotypes in free-ranging mouflon. At present, evidence of prion diseases in the German mouflon population has not been found. However, it cannot be entirely ruled out that prion diseases are present in the populations at very low prevalence, since a sample survey was performed. Results of the genotyping indicate that mouflon are genetically highly susceptible to classical scrapie and BSE and susceptible to atypical scrapie. In addition a potential direct and indirect contact to scrapie-infected domestic sheep results in a high exposure risk for mouflon in certain areas. Mouflon {{should be included in the}} TSE surveillance to ascertain a sound free-ranging population and to meet the precaution principle. Passive surveillance should be performed on all clinically conspicuous mouflon, including a veterinary examination and a rapid test. Active surveillance, i. e. examination of all hunted and fallen mouflon, is advisable for all areas with a high exposure risk to classical scrapie...|$|E

40|$|Background: Androgens are {{important}} in prostate cancer development but how circulating levels of androgens affect risk of prostate cancer of different aggressiveness is not clear. Being childless {{has been associated with}} a lower risk of prostate cancer, {{but it is not clear}} if this association is causal or a result of residual confounding. Fathering of dizygotic twins, a marker of high fertility, has not been studied in relation to risk of prostate cancer. Another marker of life-long hormonal exposure is height, which has been associated with increased risk of cancer and cancer death. However, the association to separate cancer sites has not been consistent. The aims of this thesis were to study hormonal factors (paper I), and proxies of hormonal factors (paper II and III), and risk of prostate cancer; as well as height and risk of cancer and cancer death by separate sites (paper IV). Methods: Study designs were i) case-control studies, nested within the Västerbotten Intervention Project (paper I), and in Prostate Cancer database Sweden 2. 0 (PCBaSe 2. 0) (paper II and III), and ii) cohort study, in the Metabolic Syndrome and Cancer project (Me-Can) (paper IV). Results, prostate cancer: In paper I, increasing levels of serum androgens were not associated with risk of prostate cancer overall or in tumor <b>risk</b> <b>categories.</b> In paper <b>II,</b> childless men had a lower risk of prostate cancer, overall and in all <b>risk</b> <b>categories,</b> compared to fathers, an association which was in part explained by differences in marital status and educational level.   In paper III, fathers of dizygotic twins did not have an increased risk of prostate cancer, either overall or in <b>risk</b> <b>categories,</b> when compared to fathers of singletons. Results, cancer overall: In paper IV, height was associated with an increased risk of cancer and cancer death overall in both women and men. The strongest association for cancer was to malignant melanoma in both women and men, and for cancer death to post-menopausal breast cancer in women and renal cell carcinoma in men. Conclusions: These studies indicate that hormonal factors, when studied as serum levels or when studied using proxies of fertility, do not have a major impact on the risk of prostate cancer. The association between height and an increased risk of cancer appears robust for total cancer and cancer death, as well as for several separate cancer sites...|$|R

The 1 -year cumulative incidence of complete cytogenetic response was 73 % in good risk patients, 40 % in intermediate risk patients, and 22 % in poor risk patients (P = 0. 0001). Event-free survival at 3 -year was 89 % in good risk group, 70 % in intermediate group, and 54 % in poor risk group (P = 0. 0001); the estimated 3 -year progression-free survival was 95 % in good <b>risk</b> <b>category,</b> 93 % in intermediate <b>risk</b> <b>category,</b> and 87 % in poor <b>risk</b> <b>category</b> (P = 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Risk {{communication}} is a two way exchange of information, {{leading to a}} better understanding of risk. It can make use of pictograms which help patients to make decisions about their medicines. This study is part of the DRUID* project and will make use of pictograms related with medicines and driving. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a pictogram in communicating risk associated with driving impairing medicines to patients. To assess patients’ level of understanding, and intention to change behaviour by looking at various pictograms. Methods: Two studies using a 2 x 3 design were conducted. In the first study, the respondents (patients visiting a community pharmacy with a driving license) were exposed to a condition in which the pictogram (DRUID or homologue French pictogram) and the <b>risk</b> <b>category</b> (<b>category</b> I, <b>II</b> or III) were manipulated. In this study, both pictograms were accompanied by the same side-text. In the second study, the added value of the side-text was examined. Here, the respondents were exposed to a DRUID pictogram with or without side-text and again one of the three <b>risk</b> <b>categories.</b> Results: 50. 7 % of the respondents were male with a mean age of 48. 4 years-old and with a high education level (45. 6 %). After observing both DRUID and French pictograms, respondents recognized the risk of driving while taking driving impairing medicines: 78. 8 % of the respondents were likely to change their behaviour and 36. 3 % said they would drive less frequently in the presence of a medicine with such pictograms. 40. 7 % wouldn’t drive anymore. Patients showed preference for the 3 categories presented in the DRUID pictogram and 73. 3 % of the respondents felt that the side-text of the DRUID pictogram was helpful. Conclusions: Both pictograms seem to be effective in communicating risk. With the DRUID pictogram there is a clear and direct correlation between the likelihood of changing driving behaviour and the level of impairment of a medicine: the higher the category, the more likely to change driving frequency (by driving less frequently).
