50|$|In {{the first}} step of the Strep-tag {{purification}} cycle, the cell lysate containing Strep-tag fusion protein is applied to a column with immobilized Strep-Tactin (step 1). After the tagged protein has specifically bound to Strep-Tactin, a short washing step with a physiological buffer (e.g. PBS) removes all other host proteins (step 2). This is due to its extraordinary low tendency to bind proteins non specifically. Then, the purified Strep-tag fusion protein is gently eluted with a low concentration of desthiobiotin, which specifically competes for the biotin binding pocket (step 3). To regenerate the column, desthiobiotin is removed by application of a HABA containing solution (a yellow azo dye). The removal of desthiobiotin is indicated by a color change from yellow-orange to red (step 4+5).Finally, the HABA solution is washed out with a small volume of running buffer, thus making the column <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>for</b> the next purification run.|$|E

50|$|Clear Creek Camp is {{an outdoor}} {{education}} center located 2 mi {{south of the}} town of Scofield, for post-fifth grade students in the Alpine School District. Each summer, Clear Creek Camp hosts approximately 1,100 students. The summer camp experience is designed to educate students about the outdoors and help foster a deep appreciation for the abundant natural resources and beauty in their surroundings. The camp has its roots in an outdoor education program held at Central Elementary School in the 1940s. Between 1940 and the 1960s, the program eventually grew to be so successful that a summer camp was requested. It was held at various locations for many years, including the town of Clear Creek for which it is named.

40|$|Background: FXTAS (fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease with tremor and ataxia as the primary symptoms and ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions as the major neuropathological hallmark. FXTAS affects premutation males with an expanded premutation CGG repeat in the promoter of the FMR 1 gene. The expanded premutation CGG RNA is considered toxic. Inducible transgenic mice were generated, using the Tet-on system to express transgene expanded premutation 99 CGG along with an eGFP reporter under control of dox (doxycycline) induction, as well as specific driver promoter, the GFA 2 -rtTA and PrP-rtTA. This study aims to characterize those mouse models so they would be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>used</b> <b>for</b> further studies. Methods: Immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and RT-Q-PCR techniques were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> characterize the transgene expression of the transgenic mice. Characterization of ubiquitin inclusions formation used immunohistochemistry technique. Results: The Tet-on- 99 CGG-eGFP transgene worked in vivo, while Tet-on- 11 CGG-eGFP lost its expression. Tet-on- 99 CGG-eGFP/GFA 2 -rtTA bigenic mice did not work in vivo, while Tet-on- 99 CGG-eGFP/PrP-rtTA bigenic mice did work. As expected, the Tet-on- 99 CGG-eGFP/PrP-rtTA mice formed the FXTAS hallmark, the ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions after 12 weeks of dox induction. Conclusions: Mouse model Tet-on- 99 CGG-eGFP/PrP-rtTA worked well, and were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>used</b> <b>for</b> main further studies.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we propose an {{algorithm}} for stabilizing circular formations of fixed-wing UAVs with constant speeds. The algorithm {{is based on the}} idea of tracking circles with different radii in order to control the inter-vehicle phases with respect to a target circumference. We prove that the desired equilibrium is exponentially stable and thanks to the guidance vector field that guides the vehicles, the algorithm can be extended to other closed trajectories. One of the main advantages of this approach is that the algorithm guarantees the confinement of the team in a specific area, even when communications or sensing among vehicles are lost. We show the effectiveness of the algorithm with an actual formation flight of three aircraft.
