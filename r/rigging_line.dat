50|$|The first {{specifically}} designed Japanese military parachute was the Type 01 of 1941, {{similar to the}} German RZ version, which has {{more in common with}} the Italian D-30 series chute, having a canopy diameter of 28 feet (8.5 metres) in a pronounced hemispherical shape with skirting and a vent hole for stable flight.

Leonard for the degree of Master of Forestry in Forest Operations presented on September 8 th. 2003 Title: Applications for Synthetic Rope in Logging Steel wire rope is used for many logging applications. This material has served the logging industry well in terms of strength, durability, and longevity. Steel wire rope is difficult to use because of properties that make it stiff, heavy, and unyielding. These same properties cause fatigue, exhaustion, and may contribute to worker injuries.

Initial trials with cooperating logging contractors showed positive ergonomics and logging productivity efficiencies. The logging industry is slow to change; so, not all of these initial trials were accepted. Designed research of synthetic rope in logging is needed to determine when synthetic rope is a suitable replacement for steel Vllfe rope. replace In our trials, we assessed static line applications (guylines, intermediate support lines, tree straps, and snap guylines) and running line applications for yarding and ground-based logging systems. Our running line applications using synthetic rope included two skidder / crawler tractor winching trials, a Boman Mark IV carriage trial, and a Koller K 300 mainline trial. Static line applications such as guylines, intermediate support lines, tree straps, and snap guylines are acceptable replacements of steel wire rope with synthetic rope. Loggers were more likely to try additional applications once they used synthetic rope as tree straps and were confident of its strength. Cost was an initial drawback for most logging contractors. Additional {{research is needed to determine}} damage, replacement, and wear criteria for synthetic rope in logging applications. Running line applications showed positive results in the skidder / crawler winching trials with faster cycle times and increased efficiencies for using synthetic rope. The Koller K 300 mainline trials also produced positive results as a running line. The Boman Mark IV internal drum carriage trial showed no significant differences between steel wire rope and synthetic rope. We believe designed research is necessary to evaluate carriage applications with synthetic rope. Future studies for static line applications should include guyline taglines, skyline taglines, haywire (<b>rigging</b> <b>line)</b> replacement, and various other applications. Putting synthetic rope into the hands of users will help identify valuable applications where synthetic rope has merit. Future studies for running lines should focus on designed trials to adequately observe the effects of synthetic rope in specific applications such as side-hill lateral yarding, uphill lateral pulling in winching trials, and other difficult logging conditions. Preliminary results show synthetic rope is a good candidate for the replacement of steel wire rope in selected logging applications. More research is needed to determine damage, replacement, and wear criteria for all applications of synthetic rope in logging...|$|E

50|$|Main parachutes used by skydivers {{today are}} {{designed}} to open softly. Overly rapid deployment was an early problem with ram-air designs. The primary innovation that slows the deployment of a ram-air canopy is the slider; a small rectangular piece of fabric with a grommet near each corner. Four collections of lines go through the grommets to the risers (risers are strips of webbing joining the harness and the <b>rigging</b> <b>lines</b> of a parachute). During deployment, the slider slides down from the canopy to just above the risers. The slider is slowed by air resistance as it descends and reduces {{the rate at which}} the lines can spread.
