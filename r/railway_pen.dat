The Pen y Mount to Pont Croesor section would then be handed over to the FR's construction company for incorporation into the rest of the WHR. Finally, in between its principal services, the FR would then operate trains from the WHR Ltd's Porthmadog (WHR) Station, to unspecified destinations on the WHR, using WHR Ltd locomotives, rolling stock and (where possible) WHR Ltd staff.

The Denbigh Agricultural Showground is located approximately three miles west of the centre of the town. May Pen's geographical position is situated at near the centre of the entire island. May Pen has long been viewed as one of Jamaica's most important agriculture towns. During its heyday of Jamaica Bauxite Mining, Citrus and Sugar productions, Clarendon was among Jamaica leading parishes in economic activity. With the now defunct (Jamaica <b>Railway</b> Corporation) May <b>Pen</b> which had served as the crossroads of Jamaica natural resources, connecting FrankField and its Citrus in the north of the parish, with Lionel Town and its sugar production in the South.

6000|$|About this time, too, {{another man}} of note and of great {{scientific}} and mechanical sagacity lent his powerful aid {{to advance the}} interests of the railway cause. This was Charles Maclaren, of Edinburgh, editor of the Scotsman newspaper for nearly thirty years. He had long foreseen, and boldly asserted his belief in, the certain success of steam locomotion by rail, at a time when opinions such as his were scouted as wild delusive dreams. But he did more, he brought his able pen to bear on the subject, and in December 1825 published a series of articles in the Scotsman on the subject of railways, which were not only extensively quoted and republished in this country and in America, but were deemed worthy of being translated into French and German, and so disseminated over Europe. Mr Maclaren was thus among the foremost of those who gave a telling impulse to the cause at that critical period when the Iron horse was about to be put on the rail--the right horse in the right place--for it was not many years afterwards that that auspicious event took place. Mr Maclaren not only advocated generally the adoption of railways, but logically demonstrated the wonderful powers and capacities of the steam locomotive, arguing, from the experiments on friction made {{more than half a century}} before by Vince and Colomb, that by the use of steam-power on railroads a much more rapid and cheaper transit of persons as well as merchandise might be confidently anticipated. He leaped far ahead of many of even the most hopeful advocates of the cause, and with almost prophetic foresight wrote, [...] "there is scarcely any limit to the rapidity of movement these iron pathways will enable us to command." [...] And again,--"We have spoken of vehicles travelling at twenty miles an hour; but we see no reason for thinking that, in the progress of improvement, a much higher velocity might not be found practicable; and in twenty years hence a shopkeeper or mechanic, on the most ordinary occasion, may probably travel with a speed that would leave the fleetest courser behind." [...] Wonderful words these! At a first glance we may not deem them so, being so familiar with the ideas which they convey, but our estimate of them will be more just if we reflect that when they were <b>penned</b> <b>railways</b> had scarcely sprung into being, steam locomotives had only just been born, and not only men in general, but even many learned, scientific and practical men regarded the statement of all such opinions as being little short of insanity. Nevertheless, many deep-thinking men thought differently, and one contemporary, reviewing this subject in after years, said of Mr Maclaren's papers, that, [...] "they prepared the way for the success of railway projectors." ...|$|R
40|$|As {{the last}} of the Conestoga wagons crossed the Nebraska plains along the worn and rutted Oregon Trail, the tracks of the Union Pacific were already being laid. Telegraph wires had crossed the {{continent}} by 1861; the railroad would follow within the decade. Touted as the latest technology to transform space and time, the railroad was to 2 ̆ 2 bind all portions of our country in one homogeneous organism of political, military, social, commercial and Christian nationality and power. 2 ̆ 22 Trains from the East transported consumer goods and consumers alike to the western territories, traversing in a single hour what once had taken a full day. Boxcars carried the plows and barbed wire that would refashion the Great Plains, as well as the household items that would domesticate it. Passenger cars held soldiers and farmers hoping to settle and reshape the West. But curiosity seekers also purchased railway tickets, eager simply to view a new land, not to inhabit it. By the 1860 s tourism (a word coined {{at the beginning of the}} nineteenth century) began to shift the focus of its already burgeoning trade from foreign to domestic travels. Ads urged the leisure class to 2 ̆ 2 First See America 2 ̆ 23; travel guides instructed vacationers on what was to be seen. In the final decades of the nineteenth century railroad magnates reaped the profits of a golden age of leisure travel and editors filled the pages of newspapers, magazines, and books with literary accounts of <b>railway</b> journeys. Words <b>penned</b> by tourists reveal far more than just the characteristics of their accommodations or the scenes and events they encountered along the way. Ideologies lie entangled in descriptions, and each repetition reinforces their cultural significance. By examining tourist responses to one brief portion of the Union Pacific 2 ̆ 7 s transcontinental route through the Platte River Valley of central Nebraska, we can explore the far-reaching influence of the ideologies of progress and tourism (Fig. 1). For the travelers 2 ̆ 7 views of this region were framed not only by the train car window but also (and perhaps primarily) by the 2 ̆ 2 vision 2 ̆ 2 promoted by those who had made the journey earlier. I analyze the interplay of these various discourses-to explore the forces that shaped the tourist gaze (and in so doing reshaped the Nebraska plains at the close of the nineteenth century). Perhaps underlying all, and most fundamental, was a reconceptualization of space and time influenced by both technological and cultural changes. Tourism both extends and suspends capitalist practices. Though a form of consumerism, tourism also entails a temporary abandonment of daily business routines and transactions. Victor and Edith Turner 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of the Christian pilgrimage, especially their identification of the three distinct phases of their journey, has been applied to tourism. Travelers first undergo a social and physical separation from their ordinary acquaintances and familiar surroundings. Secondly, they experience a state of liminality, an 2 ̆ 2 anti-structure [...] . out of time and place 2 ̆ 2 where conventional social ties are suspended and new bonds of community are formed. And finally, upon their return home, the travelers are reintegrated into former social ties, though often with a change in status upward. 4 The leisure trip becomes yet another prized consumer acquisition...|$|R
