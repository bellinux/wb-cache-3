While praising the discussion between the guests as, [...] "funny and flowing, and quite endearingly quirky", she found that the programme [...] "fizzled away when it reached what {{ought to have been}} its crux: the donation of kooky items to the imaginary museum. Instead, we had a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they were, and then a sudden ending that was both limp and abrupt." ...|$|E
500|$|As no {{permanent}} solution could be agreed upon, a temporary, symbolic solution was created. In 1977, {{one of the}} four stone arches that had originally supported the synagogue's monumental dome was recreated. The height of the original building, including the dome, had been 50% greater than that of the new commemorative arch, which stood [...] high. Together with the remains of the building and explanatory plaques, it was a stark <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> had once stood at the site.|$|E

500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode {{three and a half}} stars out of five and called it [...] "an {{exercise}} in nostalgia". The two called the episode [...] "touching" [...] and noted that many of the in-jokes in the script, such as Harrison asking the agents how they got back from Antarctica, were [...] "very funny". Shearman and Pearson, however, did slightly critique the way the X-Files were presented noting that the case was comparatively a [...] "rather low-key humdrum affair". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a positive review, writing, [...] "The future of The X-Files is unsettled, but 'Alone' served as a pleasant <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> has come before and why the journey to this point has, for the most part, been so wonderful." ...|$|E
500|$|The Bristol Customshouse and Post Office is {{historically}} significant as [...] "an {{example of the}} rediscovery of the Italian palazzo mode of architecture after the long proliferation-of the Greek Revival." [...] Though Young designed dozens of building for the United States Department of the Treasury, he was {{a master of the}} Greek Revival style and his designs varied throughout the years during the popularization of subsequent styles. Young also designed the United States Customshouse in Providence, Rhode Island a year prior, but its design reflected a more [...] "classical, academic theme" [...] in a more Tuscan style. The Bristol Customshouse and Post Office [...] "serves as an excellent example of a style that is little represented in a town which has fine buildings of other styles and periods, and is a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was once one of the most active seaports in the northeast".|$|E
500|$|IGN's Chad Grischow {{said the}} group charged [...] "full steam ahead with the most rock focused album of their career". He noted the album took the [...] "harder edge of their last album" [...] and moulded it [...] "into {{something}} they, and their fans, should be much happier with". In a brief review for Newsday, Glenn Gamboa {{said it was a}} [...] "testament" [...] to the group's talent that they can [...] "turn essentially a transition album into something that sounds this good". PopMatters reviewer Kiel Hauck wrote that Lazzara and Nolan's call-and-response vocals, featured on the group's debut, were placed [...] "perfect throughout the record" [...] as the pair [...] "create a beautiful combination that serves as a <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> made this band so special in the first place". Tori Pederson of Punknews.org {{said the group}} [...] "sound like a well-oiled machine here," [...] producing [...] "arguably the best album of their career" [...] in the process.

50|$|Prior to World War II, {{the area}} that is today called Chinatown was Portland’s Japantown. Beginning in the 1890s, many Japanese {{immigrants}} were processed through Portland, creating a demand for hotels, bathhouses, and other services. Businesses that formed in the city’s Japantown thrived in the low-rent areas near the river. Today the Japanese American Historical Plaza and the Oregon Nikkei Legacy Center in what is today Portland’s Chinatown serve as <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was once Portland’s Japantown.|$|R
500|$|Jim Steranko, {{an artist}} and writer {{who worked on the}} Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. comic between 1966 and 1968, was {{critical}} of the pilot episode, lamenting that [...] "the show had no menace, no tension." [...] For the second episode, Steranko said that it was [...] "too unfocused to be satisfying," [...] but praised Jackson's cameo as Nick Fury as [...] "an electrifying <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the series could and should be." [...] In contrast, Steranko's opinion of some later episodes in the first season were more positive, congratulating the writer and director of [...] "The End of the Beginning" [...] for [...] "finding an entertaining, bravura groove that finally brings the concept to life", and saying of the next episode [...] "I was concerned that last week's bravura transformation was only a fluke, but it was apparent from the opening moments that the exec lineup's new image-and-edit policy was in play." [...] Overall, however, he found season one to be [...] "22 episodes of 'sanctified' plot and character crumbs being salted with terminally-sluggish velocity (into anemic 'standalone' stories)".|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Christy Lemire of the Associated Press {{found that}} [...] "the {{inevitable}} comparisons to Iron Man, Marvel Studios' first blockbuster this summer, {{serve as a}} glaring <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> this Hulk lacks: wit and heart. Despite the presence of Edward Norton, an actor capable of going just as deep as Robert Downey Jr., we don't feel {{a strong sense of}} Bruce Banner's inner conflict". A.O. Scott of The New York Times opined, [...] "'The Adequate Hulk' would have been a more suitable title. There are some big, thumping fights and a few bright shards of pop-cultural wit, {{but for the most part}} this movie seems content to aim for the generic mean". David Ansen of Newsweek wrote, [...] "Leterrier has style, he's good with action and he's eager to give the audience its money's worth of bone-crunching battles. Still, once the movie leaves the atmospheric Brazilian settings, nothing in this [...] "Hulk" [...] sinks in deeply: its familiar genre pleasures are all on the surface. ... The movie's scene stealer is Tim Blake Nelson, making a comically welcome third act appearance as the unethical but madly enthusiastic scientist Samuel Sterns".|$|E
500|$|Commentators cited Jennifer Aniston's {{appearance}} as {{the highlight of}} the episode. Entertainment Weekly Annie Barrett lauded the interactions between Aniston and Cox; [...] "Their interactions were along the lines of what I imagine it would have been like if Rachel's character had suddenly decided she had become a wizard." [...] Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic echoed synonymous thoughts, and felt that Aniston's performance reminded the audience of her star power. Fallon wrote: [...] "Aniston's performance was delightfully weird and offbeat—and comedically sharp, a welcome change from the generic and bland film roles she's played in the years since Friends ended. Last night's performance spotlighted her gifts as a character actress—and served as a frustrating <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we've been missing since she has [...] abandoned that niche of acting." [...] Sepinwall expressed that Aniston [...] "acquits herself just fine in the small role of Jules' eccentric new therapist. She's likable and daffy but never over-the-top." [...] Hollywood Life journalist Laura Schreffler was not as enthusiastic as the general consensus, avouching that Aniston's guest appearance was overhyped and a [...] "glorified cameo". Schreffler added that Cox overshadowed her, asserting that she [...] "is still way more hilarious".|$|E

50|$|Like Vasily Safonov and (in later life) Leopold Stokowski, Scherchen {{commonly}} {{avoided the}} use of a baton. His technique when in this mode sometimes caused problems for players; an unidentified BBC Symphony Orchestra bassoonist told the singer Ian Wallace that interpreting Scherchen's minuscule hand movements was like trying to milk a flying gnat. According to Fritz Spiegl, Scherchen worked largely through verbal instructions to his players and his scores were peppered with <b>reminders</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he needed to say at each critical point in the music.|$|R
500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Abby West commented of Dwight's ouster, [...] "There's no way Rainn Wilson {{is off the}} show, {{but it was a}} bold move to let him {{appear to}} be bested by the (slightly) more Machiavellian Andy. I can't wait to see how they play out this storyline." [...] West {{referred}} to [...] "Phyllis' expert psychological move" [...] with the makeovers as her favorite subplot of the night, and appreciated the spotlight on the sales pairings; she expanded on this latter point, [...] "The trip out of the office was also a great <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> these Dunder Mifflin-ers actually do and how good most of them are. Isn't it interesting that as much as they normally clash, Dwight and Jim make a very effective sales team, while the seeming bond that Michael and Andy share did nothing to keep Andy from punting their pitch? When Dwight started using the client's phone, Jim didn't skip a beat. They'd either used the ploy (of dialing the competition's customer service number and showing how long the wait time was) before, or Jim is comfortable going with Dwight's flow, at least in that kind of setting. They essentially played good cop/bad cop... or good cop/weird cop." [...] Other television critics also praised the various sales call pairings.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{called the}} episode [...] "an {{adequate}} hour of action-adventure television, {{but the first}} 59 minutes are missing the spark of the final post-credits scene", seeing room for improvement for all the cast members, and concluding that the show falls [...] "somewhere between Firefly and Dollhouse on the spectrum of Whedon TV influences". [...] Graeme Virtue of The Guardian called Gregg [...] "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.s greatest asset", finding the Jackson cameo to be a [...] "thrill", but that [...] "plot-wise, things perhaps still feel a little inconsequential". The Hollywood Reporters Marc Bernardin praised {{the scale of the}} episode, describing it as coming [...] "out of the gate like a blockbuster", but criticized its ambitions, asking [...] "Shouldn't this show be, well, nuttier? ... Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. needs to unhinge itself, but good, and not just be a procedural." [...] He also singled out Skye and May as being unfocused and underdeveloped, respectively, as characters, and he felt the Jackson cameo [...] "gave the whole thing a charge that, in truth, it didn't really earn." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., found the episode to be [...] "smoother , although more formulaic". He criticized the plot and characters, but praised Jackson's cameo as [...] "an electrifying <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the series could and should be." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{in later}} years, {{the film has}} {{appeared}} periodically on lists of underrated films. Speed Racer was elected the third most underrated film of the 2000s by Den of Geek's N.P. Horton, which called it [...] "a game-changing film which redefined and reconceptualised the film form as we know it." [...] Nick Hyman, writing for Metacritic, included the film on its list of [...] "movies that critics got wrong" [...] calling it [...] "a cult classic in the making". It was described as [...] "nearly unmatched [...] insofar as action/adventure/family films go" [...] by Alejandro Stepenberg from JoBlo.com, while Slates Chris Wade named it [...] "an underrated masterpiece," [...] stating [...] "they [...] made a brilliant visual cartoon that dares to ask that you take it seriously." [...] Annalee Newitz of io9 analyzed the ten reasons why she believes the film to be an [...] "unsung masterpiece"; among them, the visuals, the humor, and even its political themes. Tor.com's Dexter Palmer considered {{the possibility that the}} film is a [...] "misunderstood art film", highlighting its color scheme that is a [...] "pleasure" [...] and the fact it does not try to seem real. Palmer lauded it because he does not think films must imitate reality, and ultimately said it is [...] "an extreme <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> films, and especially fantasy and science fiction films, can place on screen" [...] and that it is [...] "a refreshing change of pace" [...] in film industry. Collider's Kayti Burt ranked it at #30 of Best Hollywood Blockbusters of the 21st Century stating, [...] "While other blockbusters of the year (and the decade) worked to ground their fantastical premises in a gritty, realistic setting, Speed Racer leaned hard in the other direction." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1943, at {{the behest}} of the Ministry of Information, Olivier began working on Henry V. Originally he had no {{intention}} of taking the directorial duties, but ended up directing and producing, in addition to taking the title role. He was assisted by an Italian internee, Filippo Del Giudice, who had been released to produce propaganda for the Allied cause. The decision was made to film the battle scenes in neutral Eire, where it was easier to find the 650 extras. John Betjeman, the press attaché at the British embassy in Dublin, played a key liaison role with the Irish government in making suitable arrangements. The film was released in November 1944. Brooke, writing for the BFI, considers that it [...] "came too late in the Second World War to be a call to arms as such, but formed a powerful <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Britain was defending." [...] The music for the film was written by William Walton, [...] "a score that ranks with the best in film music", according to the music critic Michael Kennedy. Walton also provided the music for Olivier's next two Shakespearean adaptations, Hamlet (1948) and Richard III (1955). Henry V was warmly received by critics. The reviewer for The Manchester Guardian wrote that the film combined [...] "new art hand-in-hand with old genius, and both superbly of one mind", in a film that worked [...] "triumphantly". The critic for The Times considered that Olivier [...] "plays Henry on a high, heroic note and never is there danger of a crack", in a film described as [...] "a triumph of film craft". There were Oscar nominations for the film, including Best Picture and Best Actor, but it won none and Olivier was instead presented with a [...] "Special Award". He was unimpressed, and later commented that [...] "this was my first absolute fob-off, and I regarded it as such." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics.
