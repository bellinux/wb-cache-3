50|$|A severe {{shortage}} of potassium in body fluids may cause a potentially fatal condition known as hypokalemia. Hypokalemia typically results from loss of potassium through diarrhea, diuresis, or vomiting. Symptoms {{are related to}} alterations in membrane potential and cellular metabolism. Symptoms include muscle weakness and cramps, paralytic ileus, ECG abnormalities, intestinal paralysis, decreased reflex response and (in severe cases) <b>respiratory</b> paralysis, <b>alkalosis</b> and arrhythmia.|$|R
25|$|The {{human body}} can adapt to high {{altitude}} through both immediate and long-term acclimatization. At high altitude, {{in the short}} term, the lack of oxygen is sensed by the carotid bodies, which causes {{an increase in the}} breathing depth and rate (hyperpnea). However, hyperpnea also causes the adverse effect of <b>respiratory</b> <b>alkalosis,</b> inhibiting the respiratory center from enhancing the respiratory rate as much as would be required. Inability to increase the breathing rate can be caused by inadequate carotid body response or pulmonary or renal disease.|$|E
25|$|Full acclimatization, however, {{requires}} days or even weeks. Gradually, {{the body}} compensates for the <b>respiratory</b> <b>alkalosis</b> by renal excretion of bicarbonate, allowing adequate respiration to provide oxygen without risking alkalosis. It takes about four days {{at any given}} altitude and can be enhanced by drugs such as acetazolamide. Eventually, the body undergoes physiological changes such as lower lactate production (because reduced glucose breakdown decreases the amount of lactate formed), decreased plasma volume, increased hematocrit (polycythemia), increased RBC mass, a higher concentration of capillaries in skeletal muscle tissue, increased myoglobin, increased mitochondria, increased aerobic enzyme concentration, increase in 2,3-BPG, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Pulmonary artery pressure increases {{in an effort to}} oxygenate more blood.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in respiration rate {{from the low}} range to the high range is sudden and occurs in response to hyperthermia. Birds lack sweat glands, so when placed under stress due to heat, they heavily rely upon increased evaporation from the respiratory system for heat transfer. This rise in respiration rate however is not necessarily associated with a greater rate of oxygen consumption. Therefore, unlike other birds, the common ostrich is able to dissipate heat through panting without experiencing <b>respiratory</b> <b>alkalosis</b> by modifying ventilation of the respiratory medium. During hyperpnea ostriches pant at a respiratory rate of 40–60 cycles per minute, versus their resting rate of 6–12 cycles per minute. Hot, dry and moisture lacking properties of the common ostrich respiratory medium affects oxygen's diffusion rate (Henry's Law).|$|E
40|$|Background: Hypercapnic Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) {{exacerbation}} {{in patients}} with comorbidities and multidrug therapy is complicated by mixed acid-base, hydro-electrolyte and lactate disorders. Aim {{of this study was}} to determine the relationships of these disorders with the requirement for and duration of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) when treating hypercapnic respiratory failure. Methods: Sixty-seven consecutive patients who were hospitalized for hypercapnic COPD exacerbation had their clinical condition, respiratory function, blood chemistry, arterial blood gases, blood lactate and volemic state assessed. Heart and respiratory rates, pH, PaO 2 and PaCO 2 and blood lactate were checked at the 1 st, 2 nd, 6 th and 24 th hours after starting NIV. Results: Nine patients were transferred to the intensive care unit. NIV was performed in 11 / 17 (64. 7 %) mixed <b>respiratory</b> acidosis-metabolic <b>alkalosis,</b> 10 / 36 (27. 8 %) respiratory acidosis and 3 / 5 (60 %) mixed respiratory-metabolic acidosis patients (p = 0. 026), with durations of 45. 1 ± 9. 8, 36. 2 ± 8. 9 and 53. 3 ± 4. 1 hours, respectively (p = 0. 016). The duration of ventilation was associated with higher blood lactate (p< 0. 001), lower pH (p = 0. 016), lower serum sodium (p = 0. 014) and lower chloride (p = 0. 038). Hyponatremia without hypervolemic hypochloremia occurred in 11 respiratory acidosis patients. Hypovolemic hyponatremia with hypochloremia and hypokalemia occurred in 10 mixed <b>respiratory</b> acidosis-metabolic <b>alkalosis</b> patients, and euvolemic hypochloremia occurred in the other 7 patients with this mixed acid-base disorder. Conclusions: Mixed acid-base and lactate disorders during hypercapnic COPD exacerbations predict the need for and longer duration of NIV. The combination of mixed acid-base disorders and hydro-electrolyte disturbances should be further investigated. © 2012 Terzano et al...|$|R

5000|$|As {{blood plasma}} {{hydrogen}} ion concentration decreases, caused by <b>respiratory</b> or metabolic <b>alkalosis,</b> {{the concentration of}} freely ionized calcium, the biologically active component of blood calcium, decreases. Because a portion of both hydrogen ions and calcium are bound to serum albumin, when blood becomes alkalotic, the bound hydrogen ions dissociate from albumin, freeing up the albumin to bind with more calcium and thereby decreasing the freely ionized portion of total serum calcium. For every 0.1 increase in pH, ionized calcium decreases by about 0.05 mmol/L. This hypocalcaemia related to alkalosis is partially responsible for the cerebral vasoconstriction that causes the lightheadedness, fainting, and paraesthesia often seen with hyperventilation.|$|R
500|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} arises {{because of}} a lack of insulin in the body. The lack of insulin and corresponding elevation of glucagon leads to increased release of glucose by the liver (a process that is normally suppressed by insulin) from glycogen via glycogenolysis and [...] also through gluconeogenesis. High glucose levels spill over into the urine, taking water and solutes (such as sodium and potassium) along with it in a process known as osmotic diuresis. This leads to polyuria, dehydration, and polydipsia. The absence of insulin also leads to the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue (lipolysis), which are converted through a process called beta oxidation, again in the liver, into ketone bodies (acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate). β-Hydroxybutyrate can serve as an energy source in the absence of insulin-mediated glucose delivery, and is a protective mechanism in case of starvation. The ketone bodies, however, have a low pKa and therefore turn the blood acidic (metabolic acidosis). The body initially buffers the change with the bicarbonate buffering system, but this system is quickly overwhelmed and other mechanisms must work to compensate for the acidosis. One such mechanism is hyperventilation to lower the blood carbon dioxide levels (a form of compensatory <b>respiratory</b> <b>alkalosis).</b> This hyperventilation, in its extreme form, may be observed as Kussmaul respiration.|$|E

A case is presented in which there was an immediate response to sodium bicarbonate in three episodes of ventricular tachycardia despite the presence of alkalosis on two of the three occasions. Given the poor response to conventional therapy of arrhythmias induced by tricyclic antidepressants the use of sodium bicarbonate may be reasonable even in the presence of alkalosis.

The correlation coefficient between the ACT of pre-heparinized samples and the pH values during acidosis was 0. 55 (p< 0. 01).

An inverted biphasic effect on the efflux rate was observed after a reduction in cardiac work load. Mild hypoxia and respiratory and metabolic acidosis each resulted in a transient acceleration of Pi efflux followed by a return towards basal values during prolonged exposure to the stimulus, whereas <b>respiratory</b> and metabolic <b>alkalosis</b> produced a similar but inverted response.

Metabolic acidosis was accompanied by redistribution of H+-ATPase immunostaining towards the apical surface of IC, and metabolic alkalosis was accompanied by H+-ATPase redistribution towards the basal surface of IC. Therefore, acute metabolic acidosis produced changes consistent with increased activity of Type A IC and decreased activity of Type B IC, whereas acute metabolic alkalosis produced changes corresponding to increased activity of Type B IC and decreased activity of Type A IC.

40|$|In the dog kidney, acute {{increase}} and decrease in hydrogen ion concentration results in decrease and increase in renal vascular resistance respectively. These changes occur predominantly on the alkaline side of pH 7. 3 and result from some direct effect upon vascular smooth muscle. The re-sistance changes are less apparent in nerve intact than nerve sectioned kidneys due to opposing effects mediated through extrinsic nerves. THE preceding paper and other publicationsindicate {{that the level}} of hydrogen ion concentration is one factor affecting blood vessel caliber in certain vascular beds. A re-view of the literature, however, has revealed no studies relating pH to renal resistance which utilized direct measurements for resistance calculations and no studies which explored renal resistance and urine flow rate changes on the alkaline side of pH 7. 4. Dowds, Brickner, and Selkurt 1 explored the acid side of pH 7. 4 and found that renal resistance, calculated from indirect measurements, did not change. significantly.

40|$|A 3. 5 {{year old}} Registered Holstein cow {{presented}} to the Cornell University Equine and Farm Animal Hospital after being found recumbent in the field. She was housed {{with a group of}} other dry cows and had been witnessed to be normal the night before. The owners reported that she was genetically valuable, had been used for in-vitro fertilization, and was 238 days pregnant. Upon presentation, she was bright, alert, and responsive and continued to eat hay when offered. On physical exam, she was eupneic and normothermic, but tachycardic (96 bpm) with a body condition score of 8 / 9. She was non-ambulatory with apparent normal function of her thoracic limbs, but a full assessment of her pelvic limbs was not possible due to her recumbency. Initial laboratory testing revealed that she was dehydrated and hypocalcemic with both a <b>respiratory</b> and metabolic <b>alkalosis.</b> Due to her status as a dry cow, her good appetite and attitude, and her failure to improve after initial stabilization of the abnormalities identified during her initial diagnostic testing, it was determined that traumatic injury was the most likely cause of her recumbency. Supportive care and pain management were provided until the patient stabilized enough to attempt floatation after about 3 days. At that time, she failed to bear weight on either pelvic limb suggesting a poor prognosis. Ultrasound imaging revealed a dorsally luxated right femoral head. No images of the left femoral head or acetabulum could be obtained. She was ultimately euthanized and necropsy revealed bilateral hip luxation, left gluteal muscle avulsion, diffuse pulmonary edema, and mild heart disease, which was thought to pre-date her injury. After determining her poor prognosis, the focus of care turned to maximizing the genetic potential that could be obtained {{at the end of her}} life. Multiple options were considered including maturation of fetal lungs and pre-term terminal caesarian section in an attempt to save the calf, ovarian super-stimulation with ovarian collection prior to euthanasia, collection of tissue for cloning, or combinations of these technologies. Unfortunately, the medication most commonly used to mature fetal lungs, dexamethasone, has been linked to poor oocyte quality during ovarian super-stimulation, so combination of these technologies required careful analysis of the risks versus potential benefits. Additionally, while ovarian follicular waves have been shown to continue through the eighth month of pregnancy, the mean numbers of waves and the numbers of follicles per month sharply declined between months eight and nine. The benefits of dexamethasone to obtain a viable calf must therefore be weighed against its detrimental effects on in-vitro fertilization rates that are already compromised due to her stage of pregnancy. With the advent of affordable genomic testing for cattle, it has become much easier and less expensive for producers to identify the most genetically valuable animals within a herd. The biggest benefit of this technology is allowing the producer to utilize advanced reproductive technologies to obtain multiple offspring from a valuable animal within a short period of time.
