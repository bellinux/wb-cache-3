Shortly after their introduction, {{it was observed that}} they {{have a negative impact on}} the exploitation behavior of tram infrastructure, primarily on the durability of <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>systems.</b> Because of that, it was decided to modify existing <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>systems</b> to the new track exploitation conditions.

In this paper, stress based concept is used to develop a comprehensive approach for fatigue reliability analysisof fastening spring clip.

First, track and train models are analyzed dynamically in order to achieve displacement time history of fas-tening spring clip. Then this displacement time history is applied to the fastening spring clip in FE software to obtain variable ampli-tude of stresses. Crack nucleation life is calculated by rain-flow method and Palmgren-Miner linear damage rule. First Order Relia-bility Method (FORM) and Monte-Carlosimulation technique are employed for the reliability index estimations.

50|$|At 17:41 on 26 October 2005 {{the rear}} bogie of unit 508124 derailed in the Loop tunnel between Liverpool Lime Street and Liverpool Central. Due to {{concerns}} by Network Rail {{as to the}} condition of the track, there had long been a temporary speed restriction of 20 mph in the tunnel, although {{at the time of the}} derailment the train was travelling at only 12 mph. None of the 119 passengers were injured; the guard attended hospital overnight with a neck injury, but was not detained. In August 2006 a report by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) cited poor track maintenance, inadequacy of the <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>system,</b> and the track infrastructure and trains not being designed as a complete system, as causes of the derailment.

40|$|The <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>system</b> is an {{important}} part of a high-speed railway track. It is always critical to the operational safety and comfort of railway vehicles. Therefore, the condition detection of the <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>system,</b> looseness or absence, is {{an important}} task in railway maintenance. However, the vision-based method cannot identify the severity of rail fastener looseness. In this paper, the condition of <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>system</b> is monitored based on an automatic and remote-sensing measurement system. Meanwhile, wavelet packet analysis is used to analyze the acceleration signals, based on which two damage indices are developed to locate the damage position and evaluate the severity of rail fasteners looseness, respectively. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, an experiment is performed on a high-speed railway experimental platform.

Numerical methods were used in order to simulate the dynamic behaviour of the train-track interaction. Multibody system (MBS) modelling techniques were combined with techniques based on the finite element method (FEM). MBS modelling was used for modelling the vehicle and FEM for simulating the elastic track. The simulation model was validated by comparing simulated results to experimental data obtained in field testing. During the simulations various safety indices, characteristic of derailment risk, were analysed. The simulations realised at the maximum running velocity of 110 km/h showed a similar behaviour for several track types. When reducing the running speed, the safety indices worsened for both cases.

40|$|The paper {{develops}} a methodology of FE modelling and simulation {{of the bridge}} – track – moving train (BTT) system using LS-DYNA computer code. The KNI 140070 viaduct of span length 14. 40 m with ballasted track was selected as a representative for the study. Two variants of the viaduct were taken into consideration – a version operated before the modernization in 2008 and the modernized version including additional flats welded to the bottom flanges of the main beams. The German high-speed train ICE- 3 moving at 150 – 300 km/h was selected. The FE model of the BTT system was developed using Altair HyperMesh and LS-PrePost software. The platform of the viaduct was modelled using 8 -node 48 DOF solid elements. The structure was symmetrised, homogenized and reflected by linear viscoelastic orthotropic materials. Discrete model of the track included the main and side <b>rails,</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>systems,</b> sleepers, crushed stone ballast and approach RC slabs. Components of the train FE model were considered as rigid bodies. Cylindrical and revolute constrained joints were applied for kinematic connections and relations between respective components.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{numerical}} {{analysis of a}} load distribution in a railway track under wheelset are presented in the paper. Dynamic analysis was carried out using LS-DYNA computer code. Ballasted track with the rectilinear rail-line axis was taken into consideration. Finite element model of the track section was developed. The model included two <b>rails,</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>systems,</b> sleepers, ballast and the embankment. Fasteners and the ballast layer were modelled using 1 -D massless discrete elements – springs and dampers. Sleepers were modelled as elastic beams. The embankment was reflected approximately by a rectangular prism with unmovable side and bottom boundary surfaces. Moving load was applied using simplified FE models of railway vehicles. Vertical forces were put in the wheel – rail contact points. Two types of the vehicles, and loads consequently, were considered – the first one including two single wheelsets whereas the second one was equipped with two classic 2 -axle bogies. RAIL_TRACK and RAIL_TRAIN LS-DYNA’s modules were applied for simulating the vehicle – track interaction.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the measurement and modelling of noise on a steel railway {{bridge over the}} Arstaviken bay in Stockholm, Sweden. The track on the bridge was refurbished {{with the objective of}} reducing noise emission from the bridge. A mathematical model of the steel bridge structure was developed. This includes rolling noise from the train and track, and noise resulting from vibration of the structure. The model was used to identify the noise spectra from different sources within the system and these were compared with direct measurements. The model was then used to predict the effect of changing the stiffness of the <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>system</b> on the steel bridge, first on the structural noise spectrum and then on the total noise level. The predictions showed a reduction in the low frequency rumbling component of noise. Finally, baseplates of the stiffness modelled were installed on the bridge, and the measurements were repeated. The installation of the new baseplates was successful in controlling low frequency noise from the bridge. The reduction in the low frequency component of noise was approximately in agreement with that predicted...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{components}} of concrete track (rail and <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>system)</b> in railway bridge deck ends are damaged and deteriorated by track-bridge interaction forces such as uplift forces and compression forces owing to their structural flexural characteristics (bridge end rotation). This {{had led to}} demand for alternatives to improve structural safety and serviceability. In this study, the authors aim to develop a transition track to enhance the long term workability and durability of concrete track components in railway bridge deck ends and thereby improve the performance of concrete track. A time-history anal-ysis and a three-dimensional finite element method analysis were performed to consider the train speed {{and the effect of}} multiple train loads and the results were compared with the performance requirements and German standard for transition track. Furthermore, two specimens, a normal concrete track and a transition track, were fabricated to evaluate the effects of application of the developed transition track, and static tests were conducted. From the results, the track-bridge interaction force acting on the track components (rail displacement, rail stress, and clip stress) of the railway bridge deck end were sig...|$|E
40|$|Pandrol Rail Fastenings Limited are a {{designer}} and manufacturer of railway rail-fastening systems. As an organisation {{they have the}} capability to reduce the noise impact of bridges using resilient track components. They also have a commercial interest in providing such technology. Knowledge of the processes behind bridge noise is important to Pandrol in two ways; to aid the engineers within the organisation in the design of fastening systems and to demonstrate a state-of-the-art understanding of the problem of railway bridge noise to customers, as this will aid in the sale of Pandrol products. The fitting of new rail components to an existing track form, or failure to meet noise regulations with a new track form, can be costly. It is important to be able to predict accurately the effectiveness of noise reduction techniques. Currently, Pandrol’s knowledge of the problem consists almost entirely of experience gained and data gathered while working on existing bridge projects. To expand their knowledge base, Pandrol perform noise and vibration measurements on railway bridges and viaducts and then use the measured data to predict the performance of their systems on other bridges. This completely empirical approach to predicting bridge noise is both costly and situation specific results cannot be provided before the installation of the fastening system. ii Another approach to predicting bridge noise is through the application of analytical models. Limited analytical modelling in the context of bridge noise is currently conducted within the organisation. For these reasons, Pandrol are sponsoring research into bridge noise in the form of this EngD project. Here an existing rapid calculation approach is identified that relies less on the exact geometry of the bridge and more on its general characteristics. In this approach an analytical model of the track is coupled to a statistical energy analysis (SEA) model of the bridge. This approach forms a suitable basis from which to develop a better model here by concentrating on its weaknesses. A mid-frequency calculation for the power input to the bridge via a resilient track system has been developed by modelling the track-bridge system as two finite Timoshenko beams continuously connected by a resilient layer. This has resulted in a power input calculation which includes the important effects of coupling between the rail and bridge and the resonance effects of the finite length of a bridge. In addition, a detailed study of the frequency characteristics of deep I-section beams has been performed using Finite Element, Boundary Element and Dynamic stiffness models. It is shown that, at high frequencies, the behaviour of the beam is characterised by in-plane motion of the beam web and bending motion in the flange. This knowledge has resulted in an improved calculation for the mobility of a bridge at high frequencies. The above improvements are included in an improved model for use by Pandrol in their general activities. Data from real bridges is compared to predictions from the improved model in order to validate different aspects of the model. The model is then used to study the effect on noise of varying many bridge design parameters. It is shown that the parameter that has most influence on the noise performance of a bridge is the dynamic stiffness of the resilient <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>system.</b> Additionally it is demonstrated that for a given bridge and noise receiver location, an optimum fastener stiffness exists where the noise radiated by the bridge and track is at a minimum.

40|$|LKAB {{intends to}} {{increase}} the production of iron ore in the upcoming years. To prevent problems with the capacity along Malmbanan (The Iron Ore Line) {{an increase in the}} maximum permissible axle load is required. The first step is an increase from 30 ton to 32. 5 ton. The vision is {{to increase the}} axle load in 4 steps of 32. 5 - 35 - 37. 5 – 40 ton, where an axle load of 40 ton is the final goal. The report deals with the influence of an increased axle load for each track component. This is in order to present the deterioration of the track quality when the axle load is increased. Different methods of track maintenance and reinforcements will also be discussed. The work is focused on the southern circuit of Malmbanan. Track conditions on individual track sections will not be considered. The work only includes the track structure i. e. signaling systems and power supply systems will not be considered. Economical calculations of reinforcement and maintenance activities is left for future investigations. The working process has included a literature study, field study, computational study and an interview study. This has led to an assessment of to what extent each track component is affected by an increase in maximum permissible axle load. The rail will be exposed to a higher amount of wear, an increased risk for rail defects and plastic deformation of the rail head. Rail damage is most easily prevented by rail grinding and rail lubrication in sharp curves. More extensive measures are to replace the rail with a stronger rail steel or replace with a larger rail profile. The rail fastenings will be affected by higher track forces and are particularly exposed in sharp curves. The <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>systems</b> has to be replaced gradually when increasing the permissible axle load. The only fastening device, in use today, that will be approved for 40 ton axle load is the Fastclip and the strongest e-clips with plastic rail pads. The lifetime of the sleepers will be shortened with an increased axle load. A critical factor is the bending moment at the position of the rail {{and in the middle of}} the sleeper. According to the performed calculations all sleeper models eventually have to be replaced, except sleeper model A 22. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the sleeper strength for some models. Strength tests for each specific sleeper model should therefore be carried out. It is recommended that a research study is performed to gain knowledge about the track position and model for all the <b>fastening</b> <b>systems</b> and sleepers along the track. This in order to ease future track upgrades. A higher axle load leads to an accelerated deterioration of the ballast. Ballast cleaning is recommended in the near future to reduce the rate of ballast contamination. The ballast thickness should not be less than 50 cm, according to performed calculations. An increased axle load will cause an increased need for maintenance of the track substructure. Reinforcements have to be carried out on several bridges and culverts. This also applies to the geotechnics, which is mainly reinforced by pressure banks at track sections with poor subgrade. A complete investigation of the bearing capacity of the track subgrade should be performed. This in order to find track sections with insufficient bearing capacity. An investigation of the load carrying capacity for all bridges along the southern circuit of Malmbanan should also be performed...|$|R
