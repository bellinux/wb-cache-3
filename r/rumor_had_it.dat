He died in 1904, leaving his wife a large fortune, which she spent on a large {{collection}} of jewels and fortune-telling séances. Adela Kogălniceanu was robbed and murdered in October 1920; <b>rumor</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> that she had been killed by her own son, but this path was never pursued by authorities, who were quick to cancel the investigation (at the time, they were faced with the major strikes of 1920).|$|E

Just ten days after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, men of the 134th Infantry Regiment of the Nebraska Army National Guard were on their way from Camp Joseph T. Robinson near Little Rock, Arkansas to an unknown destination. <b>Rumor</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> that the train would arrive at 11, but by noon it hadn't shown up.

25|$|Thao Ma {{found himself}} under {{increasingly}} heavy emotional strain. The ongoing internal strife brought RLAF operations to a near standstill during Summer 1966. However, King Sisavang Vatthana's influence kept Thao Ma in his command. On 27 September, Thao Ma {{lost control of}} the transports. However, he remained in charge of the AT-28s, which were now dispersed into four air operations centers in four separate Military Regions of Laos. By early October, <b>rumor</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> that Thao Ma was about to be shuffled into a desk job. On 16 October, the General Staff forced Kong Le into exile. According to one source, Thao Ma was not immediately aware of this, and counted on Kong Le's aid in a coup situation.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{having a}} Romanian network to assist him, Cătărău {{was still working}} for Russian interests. Beyond his {{involvement}} with Okhrana, he was possibly affiliated with the far right of Russian nationalism. Allegations thus surfaced {{that he was a}} sworn member of the Black Hundreds or the Chamber of the Archangel Michael, both being private militias created by Bessarabian landowner Vladimir Purishkevich. This account was backed by Zamfir Arbore, who recalled that he and Stelian Popescu of Universul newspaper had visited Cătărău in Bucharest. At the time, much was made of Cătărău's possible connection with nationalist leader Aleksei Aleksandrovich Bobrinsky. A <b>rumor</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> that the Russian diplomats made efforts to obscure the relationship, whereas Arbore openly alleged having seen Bobrinsky's visiting card in Cătărău's apartment. Another suspected Russian contact, cited by Romanian sources, was allegedly a Dolgorukov prince.|$|E
500|$|Greensboro, fearing wrathful {{reprisal}} {{from the}} Union, gave the fugitives little hospitality, forcing Benjamin {{and the other}} Cabinet members to bunk in a railroad boxcar. Davis hoped to reach Texas, where <b>rumor</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> large Confederate forces remained active. [...] The Cabinet met in Greensboro, and Generals Beauregard and Joseph E. Johnston sketched the bleak military situation. [...] Davis, backed as usual by Benjamin, was determined to continue to fight. The refugee government moved south on April 15. [...] With the train tracks cut, most Cabinet members rode on horseback, but the heavyset Benjamin declared he would not ride on one until he had to, and shared an ambulance with Jules St. Martin and others. For the entertainment of his companions, Benjamin recited Tennyson's [...] "Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington".|$|E

2500|$|In September 1786, {{during an}} inter–state {{convention}} {{to discuss and}} develop a consensus about reversing the protectionist trade barriers that each state had erected, James Madison angrily questioned whether the Articles of Confederation was a binding compact or even a viable government. Connecticut paid nothing and [...] "positively refused" [...] to pay U.S. assessments for two years. A <b>rumor</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> that a [...] "seditious party" [...] of New York legislators had opened {{a conversation with the}} Viceroy of Canada. To the south, the British were said to be openly funding Creek Indian raids on white settlers in Georgia and adjacent territory. Savannah (then-capital of Georgia) had been fortified, and the state of Georgia was under martial law. Additionally, during Shays' Rebellion (August 1786 – June 1787) in Massachusetts, Congress could provide no money to support an endangered constituent state. [...] General Benjamin Lincoln was obliged to raise funds from Boston merchants to pay for a volunteer army.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, he {{was opposed}} to antisemitism, {{defining}} it as [...] "an act of poverty of a failed intellectual or a cheap opportunity of self-assertion" [...] and [...] "a stupid ferment of anarchic agitation". Nevertheless, he changed his position, by rallying with the leading antisemitic and fascist camp. By 1938, Sân-Giorgiu expressed his support for Nazism and reportedly {{made a habit of}} wearing a Nazi-inspired swastika on his clothes, while maintaining close contacts with the authoritarian King Carol II. According to the marginalized Romanian Jewish author Mihail Sebastian, <b>rumor</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> that, in 1936, Sân-Giorgiu sought endorsement from Nazi Germany and competed for its attention with Nae Ionescu, a far right philosopher who had broken with Carol and supported the Iron Guard. The same account has it that Sân-Giorgiu and his journalist ally Pamfil Şeicaru managed to undermine Ionescu's standing, by presenting Nazi officials with proof that the philosopher had dealings with the prominent Jewish banker Aristide Blank.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Rumor</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> {{that when}} Marcellus, nephew of Augustus, died in 23 BC, {{it was no}} natural death, and that Livia was behind it. After the two elder sons of Julia by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, whom Augustus had adopted as sons and successors, had died, the one {{remaining}} son Agrippa Postumus was adopted {{at the same time}} as Tiberius, but later Agrippa Postumus was sent to an island and finally killed. Tacitus charges that Livia was not altogether innocent of these deaths and Cassius Dio also mentions such rumours. There are also rumors mentioned by Tacitus and Cassius Dio that Livia brought about Augustus' death by poisoning fresh figs. Augustus' granddaughter was Julia the Younger. Sometime between 1 and 14, her husband Lucius Aemilius Paullus was executed as a conspirator in a revolt. Modern historians theorize that Julia's exile was not actually for adultery but for involvement in Paullus' revolt. [...] Livia Drusilla plotted against her stepdaughter's family and ruined them. This led to open compassion for the fallen family. Julia died in 29 AD on the same island where she had been sent in exile twenty years earlier.|$|E

2500|$|Later, as {{it became}} clear that Peniston was leaping from the Overweight Pooch's album {{to the top of the}} charts, <b>rumor</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> the Pooch was stewing over Peniston's using Female Preacher as her springboard. Tonya Davis, {{pregnant}} at the time of recording her album, swore she harbored no jealousy towards Peniston. [...] "There's no jealousy, because she has a voice. I gave her the chance, but I didn't give her a voice," [...] the rapper insisted for Phoenix New Times in July 1992, and Peniston, interviewed by the same newspaper in the meantime, reacted by her own words. [...] "I feel like anything's possible and I know one thing. If I wasn't at this spot, I still would be achieving to get to this spot." [...] Ironically enough, Sallard eventually threw in a few back-up vocals for Peniston on a song with a significant title, [...] "You Win, I Win, We Lose", while Peniston, who in return played an agent to get a record deal also for Malaika (whose album Sugar Time scored in 1993 two Top 5 hits on the US Dance chart, including the No. 1 single [...] "Gotta Know (Your Name)") mentioned the Pooch's name on her own debut album in addition, leaving Davis a note saying [...] "thanks for letting me be a part of Female Preacher".|$|E
2500|$|For {{the third}} and final {{appearance}} on January 6, 1957, Presley performed a medley of [...] "Hound Dog", [...] "Love Me Tender", and [...] "Heartbreak Hotel", followed by a full version of [...] "Don't Be Cruel". For a second set later in the show he did [...] "Too Much" [...] and [...] "When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again". For his last set he sang [...] "Peace in the Valley". According to Sullivan's co-producer Marlo Lewis, the <b>rumor</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> that [...] "Elvis has been hanging a small soft-drink bottle from his groin underneath his pants, and when he wiggles his leg it looks as though his pecker reaches down to his knee!" [...] It was decided to shoot the singer only from the waist while he performed. Although {{much has been made of}} the fact that Elvis was shown only from the waist up, except for the short section of [...] "Hound Dog", all of the songs on this show were ballads. [...] "Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows", Greil Marcus says, Elvis [...] "stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik, with all stops out. That he did so in front of the Jordanaires, who this night appeared as the four squarest-looking men on the planet, made the performance even more potent." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{the swift}} {{swinging}} from one {{consideration of the}} perplexing question to another Miss Hill's mind naturally reverted to her errand, and to her possible reception. Mrs. Bell was a proud woman. She had married against the wishes of her blue-blooded family, so <b>rumor</b> <b>had</b> <b>it,</b> and her husband was now Chief of Police in Middleville. Mrs. Bell had some money of her own and was slowly recovering her old position in society.|$|E
60|$|None {{of these}} things, however, {{disturbed}} the pawnbroker. The drunken client who endeavored {{to bail out}} his Sunday clothes with a tram ticket was accommodated with a chair, while the assistant went to hunt up his friends and contract for a speedy removal; the old woman who, {{with a view of}} obtaining a higher advance than usual, poured a tale of grievous woe into the hardened ears of Mr. Hyams, found herself left to the same invaluable assistant, and, realizing her failure, would at once become cheerful and take what was offered. Mr. Hyams’ methods of business were quiet and unostentatious, and <b>rumor</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> that he might retire at any time and live in luxury.|$|E

6000|$|So they motored to Santa Monica {{and spent}} the {{afternoon}} on the sands, watching the bathers and admiring the graceful outlines of the big yacht lying at anchor a half mile from the shore. The boat {{was something of a}} mystery to everybody. It was named the [...] "Arabella" [...] and had come from Hawaii via San Francisco; but what it was doing here and who the owner might be were questions no one seemed able to answer. <b>Rumor</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> that a Japanese prince had come in it to inspect the coast line, but newspaper reporters were forbidden to scale the side and no satisfaction was given their eager questioning by the bluff old captain who commanded the craft.

"Because {{my mother}} said that she thought some {{important}} work was on hand, and that maybe the baron would not like that women should know aught of it, for he was of suspicious and evil mind.

There were, however, a party of serfs kept at work, and also some masons, and <b>rumor</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> that they were engaged in making the secret passages. Whether it was so or not I cannot say, but I know that none of that party ever left the castle alive. It was given out that a bad fever had raged there, but none believed it; and the report went about, and was I doubt not true, that all had been killed, to preserve the secret of the passage." ...|$|E
60|$|When it {{came out}} somewhere that Duane was openly {{cultivating}} the honest stay-at-home citizens to array them in time against the other element, then Fairdale showed its wolf-teeth. Several times Duane was shot at {{in the dark and}} once slightly injured. <b>Rumor</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> that Poggin, the gunman, was coming to meet him. But the lawless element did not rise up in a mass to slay Duane on sight. It was not so much that the enemies of the law awaited his next move, but just a slowness peculiar to the frontier. The ranger was in their midst. He was interesting, if formidable. He would have been welcomed at card-tables, at the bars, to play and drink with the men who knew they were under suspicion. There was a rude kind of good humor even in their open hostility.|$|E
