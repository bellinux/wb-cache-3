25|$|Field: Each Record object {{contains}} many fields, and a <b>RecordSet</b> object has a corresponding Field object also. The <b>RecordSet</b> object's Field object {{corresponds to a}} column in the database table that it references.|$|E
25|$|Fields: This {{collection}} contains {{a set of}} Field objects. The collection {{can be used in}} either a <b>Recordset</b> object or in a Record object. In a <b>Recordset</b> object, each of the Field objects that make up the Fields collection corresponds to a column in that <b>Recordset</b> object. In a Record object, a Field can be an absolute or relative URL that points into a tree-structured namespace (used for semi-structured data providers like the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Internet Publishing) or as a reference to the default Stream object associated with that Record object.|$|E
25|$|Stream: A stream, mainly {{used in a}} <b>RecordSet</b> object, is a {{means of}} reading and writing a stream of bytes. It is mostly used to save a <b>recordset</b> in an XML format, to send {{commands}} to an OLE DB provider {{as an alternative to the}} CommandText object and to contain the contents of a binary or text file.|$|E
50|$|As a {{procedural}} language by definition, PL/SQL provides several iteration constructs, including basic LOOP statements, WHILE loops, FOR loops, and Cursor FOR loops. Since Oracle 7.3 the REF CURSOR type {{was introduced to}} allow <b>recordsets</b> to be returned from stored procedures and functions. Oracle 9i introduced the predefined SYS_REFCURSOR type, meaning {{we no longer have}} to define our own REF CURSOR types.|$|R
5000|$|WDDX is {{functionally}} {{comparable to}} XML-RPC and WIDL. The specification supports simple data types such as number, string, boolean, etc., and complex aggregates {{of these in}} forms such as structures, arrays and <b>recordsets</b> (row/column data, typically coming from database queries). There are WDDX interfaces {{for a wide variety}} of languages, including ColdFusion, Ruby, Python, PHP, Java, C++, [...]NET, Actionscript, lisp, Haskell, Perl.|$|R
50|$|Microsoft Access 2007 {{introduced}} a new database format: ACCDB. It supports links to SharePoint lists and complex data types such as multivalue and attachment fields. These new field types are essentially <b>recordsets</b> in fields and allow the storage of multiple values or files in one field. Microsoft Access 2007 also introduced File Attachment field, which stored data more efficiently than the OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) field.|$|R
25|$|Record: This object {{represents}} one {{record in the}} database, and contains a fields collection. A <b>RecordSet</b> consists {{of a collection of}} Record objects.|$|E
25|$|Immediate: The <b>recordset</b> {{is locked}} using the adLockOptimistic or adLockPessimistic lock. The data are updated {{at the data}} source after the record is changed and the Update method is called.|$|E
25|$|Error: When an OLE DB {{provider}} error occurs during {{the use of}} ADO, an Error object will be created in the Errors collection. Other errors do not go into an Error object, however. For instance, any errors that occur when manipulating data in a <b>RecordSet</b> or Field object are stored in a Status property.|$|E
40|$|Corporation have {{announced}} a new TPC-C performance record in the competitive market for database applications and UNIX servers on the AlphaServer 8400 5 / 350 four-node TruCluster system. A performance evaluation strategy enabled Digital to achieve <b>recordsetting</b> performance for this TruCluster configuration supporting the Oracle Parallel Server database application under the TPC-C workload. The system performance in this environment {{is a result of}} tuning the system under test and taking advantage of TruCluster features such as the MEMORY CHANNEL interconnect and Digital’s distributed lock manager and distributed raw disk service...|$|R
40|$|Record linkage is an {{important}} field for Digital History and Historical Demography, among others. To link data from different <b>recordsets</b> existing algorithms almost always take at least two discriminating data into account, such as a name and date of birth, to link records of an individual. If there is only sparse data available for a person, i. e. only a name, it is usually dismissed as impossible to link by the record linkage literature. This paper introduces an algorithm to link sparse data sets on individuals when, by and large, only nominal data is available...|$|R
50|$|The Call Level Interface (CLI) is an {{application}} programming interface (API) and software standard to embed Structured Query Language (SQL) code in a host program as defined in a joint standard by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC): ISO/IEC 9075-3:2003. The Call Level Interface defines how a program should send SQL queries to the database management system (DBMS) and how the returned <b>recordsets</b> should be handled by the application in a consistent way. Developed in the early 1990s, the API was defined only for the programming languages C and COBOL.|$|R
25|$|Command: After the {{connection}} object establishes a session {{to the data}} source, instructions are sent to the data provider via the command object. The command object can send SQL queries directly to the provider {{through the use of}} the CommandText property, send a parameterised query or stored procedure {{through the use of a}} Parameter object or Parameters collection or run a query and return the results to a dataset object via the Execute method. There are several other methods that can be used in the Command object relating to other objects, such as the Stream, <b>RecordSet</b> or Connection objects.|$|E
2500|$|Recordset: A <b>recordset</b> is a {{group of}} records, and can either come from a base table or {{as the result of a}} query to the table. The <b>RecordSet</b> object {{contains}} a Fields collection and a Properties collection. The Fields collection is a set of Field objects, which are the corresponding columns in the table. The Properties collection is a set of Property objects, which defines a particular functionality of an OLE DB provider. The <b>RecordSet</b> has numerous methods and properties for examining the data that exists within it. Records can be updated in the <b>recordset</b> by changing the values in the record and then calling on the Update or UpdateBatch method. Adding new records is performed through the AddNew function and then by calling on the Update or UpdateBatch method. Records are also deleted in the <b>recordset</b> with the Delete method and then by calling on the Update method. However, if for some reason the deletion cannot occur, such as because of violations in referential integrity, then the <b>recordset</b> will remain in edit mode after the call to the Update method. The programmer must explicitly call on the CancelUpdate function to cancel the update. Additionally, ADO can roll back transactions (if this is supported) and cancel batch updates. Recordsets can also be updated in one of three ways: via an immediate update, via a batch update, or through the use of transactions: ...|$|E
2500|$|Batch: The <b>recordset</b> {{is locked}} using adLockBatchOptimistic {{and each time}} Update is called the data are updated in a {{temporary}} buffer. Finally, when UpdateBatch is called the data are completely updated back at the data source. This {{has the advantage of}} it all being done in memory, and if a problem occurs then UpdateCancel is called and the updates are not sent to the data source ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{solution}} for migrating an RDB into Web semantic. The solution takes an existing RDB as input, and extracts its metadata representation (MTRDB). Based on the MTRDB, a Canonical Data Model (CDM) is generated. Finally, {{the structure of the}} classification scheme in the CDM model is converted into OWL ontology and the <b>recordsets</b> of database are stored in owl document. A prototype has been implemented, which migrates a RDB into OWL structure, for demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach by showing how the results of reasoning of this technique can help improve the Web systems...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for {{administrative}} panels {{such as the one}} described in this project. More and more website administrators wish to make changes to their online business without having to directly modify the database file. This project provides the perfect solution for this scenario by placing all database access on the World Wide Web. Administrators can now use this software to add, edit, and delete tables, fields, and records. Additionally, users will be able to generate queries without knowledge of Structured Query Language. This project acts as a summary of my computer science education at this university by requiring the following skills: Database planning, design, and usage Knowledge of HTML design and coding Experience in planning and designing software projects Knowledge of VBScript to code Active Server Pages (ASP) Use of Javascript for client-side data validation Practice in SQL generation and use of <b>Recordsets</b> In its commencement, the project will simply function as an online interface surrounding an empty Access database. Then through links on a navigation menu, users will have the choice to manipulate tables, fields, and/or records on this project. Once the panel is completely able to modify an Access database through its interface, a fictional newspaper 2 ̆ 7 s administrative panel will be designed to implement this project. The newspaper panel will run the features of this panel once login authentication has been completed...|$|R
2500|$|ADO.NET is {{the latest}} version of ADO (after ADO 2.8, now often {{referred}} to as ADO Classic) and is part of the MDAC 2.8 stack alongside classic ADO. It is built around Microsoft [...]NET. Though sometimes seen as an evolutionary step up from ADO, some fundamental structural changes were made by Microsoft. ADO.NET runs through a [...]NET Managed Provider, a modified version of an OLE DB provider specifically designed for [...]NET. The object structure is no longer built around a <b>Recordset</b> object. Instead a Dataset object is used to contain data gathered from multiple sources. This is transparent to the programmer. Unlike the old ADO <b>Recordset,</b> the Dataset's design promotes the use of disconnected data. Conceptually, a Dataset object {{can be seen as a}} small in-memory relational database in its own right that allows for manipulation of data in any direction. In order to propagate changes back into the database, a DataAdapter object is used that transfers data from between the data source and the DataSet object. Cursors were also deprecated in ADO.NET, being replaced with a DataReader object, which is used to efficiently process a large list of results one record at a time without storing them.|$|E
