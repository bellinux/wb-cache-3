It decreases the effectiveness of insecticides, thereby requiring greater quantities for comparable control with a net increase in risk of disease resurgence, product cost, and damage risk to the ecosystem. Pyrethroid resistance has been documented in Puerto Rican populations of Aedes aegypti (L.) mosquitoes. In this study, topical toxicity of five insecticides (permethrin, etofenprox, deltamethrin, DDT, transfluthrin) was determined for susceptible (Orlando-ORL) and resistant (Puerto Rico-PR) strains of Ae. aegypti. <b>Resistance</b> <b>ratios</b> were calculated using LD 50 values, and high <b>resistance</b> <b>ratios</b> for permethrin (112) and etofenprox (228) were observed for the Puerto Rico strain.

The subsequent epidemic led the Harris County Mosquito Control Division to initiate an extensive spraying operation to suppress infected adult mosquitoes. The control program was aimed at the predominate disease-carrying mosquito for the southern United States, Culex quinquefasciatus Say. With the increase of insecticide pressure on the mosquito populations, the possibility of resistance was brought into question. A three year study using a vial bioassay test was conducted in Harris (2004 - 2005) and Brazos (2005 - 2006) counties to determine the resistance status of Cx. quinquefasciatus to the six chemicals (malathion, naled, resmethrin, permethrin, sumithrin, and pyrethrum) used most frequently in adult mosquito control programs. The <b>resistance</b> <b>ratios</b> acquired from the vial bioassay tests were mapped onto shapefiles for Harris and Brazos counties, which revealed clustering of areas with pyrethroid resistance mosquito populations in the northeastern, southeastern, and southwestern corners of Loop 610 in Harris County. An additional six-month preliminary study, involving six operational areas in Harris County and three in Brazos County, was conducted, demonstrating only minor fluctuations in the monthly <b>resistance</b> <b>ratios</b> occurring in both counties in 2005. A significant correlation was documented between the two years of <b>resistance</b> <b>ratios</b> for mosquitoes to the three pyrethroids in Harris County and all the insecticides except pyrethrum in Brazos County.

The correlation analyses provide data used to predict areas where resistance can develop in the mosquito population, thus providing the control agency more data to plan future control tactics. The overall analysis indicated that Harris County has localized pockets of resistant mosquitoes; but, on a whole, it does not seem to have widespread resistance in its mosquito populations.

RESULTS: There was a negative correlation between activated protein C <b>resistance</b> <b>ratio</b> and area under the curve of thrombin-antithrombin III-complexes (rs = - 0. 60; P < 0. 003) and there was a trend to a negative correlation between activated protein C <b>resistance</b> <b>ratio</b> and area under the curve of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (rs = - 0. 37; P = 0. 07).

Unfortunately, a single amino acid mutation (G 119 S) in An. gambiae AChE- 1 (AgAChE) confers resistance to the AChE inhibitors currently approved by the World Health Organization for indoor residual spraying. In this report, we describe several carbamate inhibitors that potently inhibit G 119 S AgAChE and that are contact-toxic to carbamate-resistant An. gambiae. PCR-RFLP analysis was used to confirm that carbamate-susceptible G 3 and carbamate-resistant Akron strains of An. gambiae carry wild-type (WT) and G 119 S AChE, respectively. G 119 S AgAChE was expressed and purified for the first time, and was shown to have only 3 % of the turnover number (k(cat)) of the WT enzyme. Twelve carbamates were then assayed for inhibition of these enzymes. High <b>resistance</b> <b>ratios</b> (> 2, 500 -fold) were observed for carbamates bearing a benzene ring core, consistent with the carbamate-resistant phenotype of the G 119 S enzyme.

Most of the adult field populations exhibiting some level of bifenthrin resistance exhibited significantly lower mortality to both pyrethroids and DDT than susceptible control populations at the estimated LC 99 of susceptible populations. Results of adult dose-mortality bioassays also revealed elevated LC 50 values for bifenthrin resistant populations compared to the susceptible control population with <b>resistance</b> <b>ratios</b> ranging from 2. 5 to 5. 5 -fold for bifenthrin, 28 to 54. 8 -fold for tefluthrin, and 16. 3 to 33. 0 for DDT.

Class I integrons were detected in 14 % of wastewater isolates and 9. 1 % of downstream isolates, and primarily contained gene cassettes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. The unexpectedly high levels of multiple antibiotic resistance in strains from wastewater and downstream river were speculated to be mainly due to multidrug efflux systems...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In voltage-clamped epithelia {{the cell}} {{membrane}} potential transient during a + 10 -mV transepithelial pulse {{conforms to the}} expected behavior for a series combination of two linear resistance-capacitance (RC) circuits. The evolution of the cell potential {{is characterized by a}} single time constant with values of 30 - 130 ms in frog skin and Necturus gallbladder. These observations have important consequences for the measurement of cell membrane <b>resistance</b> <b>ratios</b> and the interpretation of current-voltage relations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{relationship}} between applied anode voltage, ring anode diameter and distance to specific voltage gradient values was modelled from empirical measurements. The model allowed distance to specific voltage gradients to be predicted. Varying the anode to cathode <b>resistance</b> <b>ratios</b> {{had a significant}} effect on the electrical potential of the anode and thus the voltage gradient projected from it. The voltage gradient profile of twin anodes was reduced when they were held in close proximity (< 5 m) ...|$|R
