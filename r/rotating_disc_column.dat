The solution of a realistic liquid-liquid test case, a counter-current <b>rotating</b> <b>disc</b> <b>column</b> (RDC) composed of three stages where the droplets exchange mass with the continuous phase, is studied. This detailed modelling approach is compared {{with two other}} possible approximated models. In the first all the droplets are assumed {{to have the same}} size and concentration, and in the second all the droplets are assumed to have the same concentration but different sizes. The results of this comparison show that the information regarding the two-dimensional droplet size-concentration distribution may be needed to properly evaluate the mass transfer rates and therefore the behaviour of the system for all the operating conditions investigated...|$|E

40|$|The {{oscillating}} {{baffle column}} presently described {{was invented by}} Dr. W. J. Thomas. It is a differentially operating continuous counter-current extractor. The experimental work is concerned with establishing {{the efficiency of the}} extractor under different conditions of operation up to the flooding point. Oscillating speeds and liquid flow rates were varied while other parameters were maintained constant. A direct comparison with the efficiency of operation of a <b>Rotating</b> <b>Disc</b> Contactor was made by carrying out the identical experiments in each case. The general differential equations for the extract and raf-finate phases in a differential contactor model have been derived by several methods. The relationship between the sign of each term in the differential equation and the direction of phase flow has been considered. The overall mass transfer coefficient in the extract phase, ka, has been measured along the column. It was found that a reversal in the trend in ka occurs depending on the speed of oscillation. At low oscillating speed ka is larger {{at the bottom of the}} column than the top and at high oscillating speeds the reverse is true. Three methods of calculating the longitudinal mixing coefficient from experimental data have been employed. The method using integration by parts is considered to be the most accurate and reliable. A dye injection technique was used to experimentally determine the C curve for different operating conditions for the Oscillating Baffle and the <b>Rotating</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>Columns.</b> A gamma function was used to relate the C curve to the variance and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient...|$|R
40|$|Liquid-liquid {{extraction}} {{is one of}} {{the important}} transfer operations in chemical engineering. In the design of extraction equipment, basic understanding of the mechanism of mass transfer between disperse phase and the continuous phase is very important. Typically, this problem is solved by means of measuring the mass transfer rate obtained from <b>rotating</b> <b>disc</b> extraction <b>column</b> (RDC) that was predicted by the model of simultaneous mass transfer. Because the mass transfer rate depends on several factors which sometimes can not be measured accurately, as the form of drops, drop size and the differences that occur in the RDC column. This study focuses on the modeling of the diffusion problem in different sizes of drop size in a stage of RDC column using the concept of diffusion in spherical drop with the assumption that the diffusion process from the continuous phase to the disperse phase occur simultaneously. Next, the simulation process for the mass transfer process of 10 drops with various sizes in a stage is done using simultaneous mass transfer model...|$|R

Accurate modeling of the process extraction in <b>Rotating</b> <b>Disc</b> Contractor (RDC) <b>column</b> is only possible with accurate description of the geometry of the drop. In this research, the diffusion equation given in prolate spheroidal coordinate system is used for a two-dimensional case. An analytical solution of the unsteady diffusion equation describing mass transfer for prolate spheroidal drops, considering a constant diffusion coefficient is presented. The resulting equations are analytically solved by using the separation method. The solution describes that the concentration of the drop decreases with the increases of drop shapes. This model can be used to study the mass transfer process of liquid-liquid extraction in RDC Column for spheroidal drop. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{development}} of an alternative approach based on the Artificial Intelligent technique called Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was carried out. This report presents a new application of ANN techniques to the modeling of prediction total concentration of drops in the <b>Rotating</b> <b>Disc</b> Contactor <b>Column</b> (RDC). The ANN was trained with the simulated data based on spherical and tear-shaped drops, which consider ten classes volume of drops. The comparison result between Neural Network output and Mathematical Model output is presented.

40|$|Several Mathematical Models {{have been}} {{developed}} for processes involving <b>Rotating</b> <b>Disc</b> Contactor (RDC) <b>Column.</b> These models indicated that the hydrodynamic and the mass transfer processes are important factors for the column performances. Usually, the mathematical simulation models describing the processes in the column are very complex. It also needs excessive computer time to produce simulation data for further analysis. Therefore, an alternative approach based on Artificial Neural Network is considered to assist in speeding up the simulation process. This paper presents a new application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques to the modeling of the liquid-liquid extraction process in the RDC Column. In this work, the ANN was trained with the simulated data obtained from Arshad (2000). The Neural Network models are able to generate 128 simulated data for RDC column with RMS error value of 1. 0 E- 07. The comparison between Neural Network output and Mathematical Model(2000) output is also presented. ...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{development}} of an improved forward model for the mass transfer process in the <b>Rotating</b> <b>Disc</b> Contactor (RDC) <b>column</b> was carried out. The existing mass transfer model with constant boundary condition does not accurately represent the mass transfer process. Thus, a time-varying boundary condition was formulated and consequently the new fractional approach to equilibrium was derived. This derivation initiated the formulation of the modiÂ¯ed quadratic driving force, called Time-dependent Quadratic Driving Force (TQDF). Based on this formulation, a Mass Transfer of A Single Drop (MTASD) Algorithm was designed, followed by a more realistic Mass Transfer of Multiple Drops (MTMD) Algorithm which was later reÂ¯ned to become another algorithm named the Mass Transfer Steady State (MTSS) Algorithm. The improved forward models, consisting of a system of multivariate equations, successfully calculate the amount of mass transfer from the continuous phase to the dispersed phase and was validated by the simulation results...|$|R
40|$|Several {{models have}} been {{developed}} for the modeling of <b>Rotating</b> <b>Disc</b> Contactor (RDC) <b>columns.</b> The modeling shows that the drop size distribution and the mass transfer processes are important factors for the column performances. Since the behavior of the drop breakage and the mass transfer process involve complex interactions between relevant parameters, the need to get {{as close as possible to}} the reality of the processes is evident. Several researchers have been working in this area. Most of these {{models have been}} studied based on the assumption of spherical droplets. The problem of spherical drop or bubble is known as the simplest and ideal case in which the problem can be considered in spherical coordinate system. However there are many physical situations the shape of the drops contained in liquid is not perfectly spherical, and may be classified as prolate or oblate spheroids. For most industrial applications particles encountered are irregular or non-spherical. In this research, the diffusion equation given in the prolate spheroidal coordinate system is used for a two-dimensional case. An analytical solution of the unsteady diffusion equation describing mass transfer for prolate spheroidal drops, considering a constant diffusion coefficient is presented. The resulting equations are analytically solved by using the Laplace transform method. </p...|$|R
40|$|Inverse {{problems}} are natural in many real world applications including industrial chemical engineering problems. In this paper, an inverse problem {{in determining the}} value of input parameters for a desired value of output parameters of mass transfer process in the 23 stages <b>Rotating</b> <b>Disc</b> Contactor (RDC) <b>column</b> is considered. Hence, an inverse model describing the process in obtaining {{the solution of the}} problem is developed. The model involves only the process of mass tansfer of a single drop of size assumed to be smaller then the critical drop size, in multiple stages RDC column. This is an extension of the work done on the mass transfer process of a single drop in single stage RDC column. The algorithm is based on fuzzy approach and the assumptions made in mass transfer process as adopted in previous work are also being used. The presented algorithm yields results such that the norm between actual outputs obtained from the approximate solution and the target output is less than 10 %. The algorithm is also capable of determining the optimal values of the input parameters. The inverse model has successfully eliminated the trial and error aspect of the forward process in determining the correct inputs for the desired outputs...|$|R
40|$|Liquid-liquid {{extraction}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important separation processes that widely used in industries. <b>Rotating</b> <b>Disc</b> Contactor (RDC) <b>column</b> {{is one of the}} liquidliquid extractor. Therefore, the study of liquid-liquid extraction in RDC column has become a very important subject to be discussed not just among the chemical engineers but mathematician as well. This project presents Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Network modeling in the prediction of concentration of dispersed phase outlet in RDC column. SVM is an exciting Machine Learning technique that learns by example to sign labels to object and can be used for regression as well as classification purpose, while Neural Network is widely used as effective approach for handling nonlinear data especially in situations where the physical processes are not fully understood. Both modeling systems offer the potential for a more flexible and less error in forecasting. Thus, it can help to save time and reducing cost in conducting experiments. A Statistica software is utilized to help with the SVM modeling and a Matlab code is produced to run the Neural Network simulation in this project. The mean square error is calculated to compare the result between the two models. The analysis shows that both SVM and Neural Network modeling can predict the concentration of dispersed phase in RDC column but the SVM approach gives better result than the Neural Network approach...|$|R

Emulsion liquid membrane is introduced as an alternatives method for CO 2 absorption because it can reduce the corrosion problem and the formation water droplets creates large interfacial area for absorption to occur. 2 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol (AMP) and monoethanolamine (MEA) present in the aqueous phase {{in the form of}} aqueous droplets, surrounded by the organic solution to form water in oil (w/o) emulsion. In this study, effects of amines ratios and amine quantities, and emulsification time and speed on the ELM stability and CO 2 absorption were investigated. The ELM was prepared by homogenizing the aqueous and the organic phases. AMP and MEA were added into sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution to form aqueous solution, and kerosene and Span- 80 were mixed to form the organic solution.
