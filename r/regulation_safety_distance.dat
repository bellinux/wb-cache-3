30|$|In summary, {{the above}} studies {{did not involve}} the minimum time {{handling}} problem while overtaking in a dynamic environment, that is, the lateral and longitudinal <b>safety</b> <b>distances</b> in the minimum time handling problem while overtaking were not considered. The longitudinal <b>safety</b> <b>distance</b> refers {{to the idea that}} the overtaking vehicle should keep a certain distance with the overtaken vehicle during the overtaking process, thereby avoiding traffic accidents such as a rear-end collision. The lateral <b>safety</b> <b>distance</b> refers to the lateral lane constraint, as well as the constraint of the vehicle width variation caused by a roll. The lateral <b>safety</b> <b>distance</b> is used to ensure the vehicle completes the overtaking behavior only within its own lane and the left adjacent lane; this can avoid the scraping of two vehicles owing to variations in body width. Therefore, considering the influence of the longitudinal and lateral <b>safety</b> <b>distances,</b> with the aim of overtaking the front vehicle as quickly as possible, the optimal overtaking trajectory and the shortest overtaking time are figured out using the inverse dynamics method.|$|R

Possible outcomes of an accidental fuel gas release were determined by performing the Event Tree Analysis approach. <b>Safety</b> <b>distances</b> were computed for two pipeline transmission systems of pressurized natural gas and {{liquefied petroleum gas}} existing in Greece using real data given by Greek Refineries and the Greek Public Gas Enterprise. The software packages CHETAH and BREEZE were used for thermochemical mixture properties estimation and quantitative consequence assessment, respectively. <b>Safety</b> <b>distance</b> determination was performed considering jet fire and gas dispersion to the lower flammable limit as the worst-case scenarios corresponding to immediate and delayed cloud ignition. The {{results showed that the}} jet fire scenario should be considered as the limiter for <b>safety</b> <b>distances</b> determination in the vicinity of natural and petroleum gas pipelines. Based on this conclusion, the obtained results were further treated to yield functional diagrams for prompt <b>safety</b> <b>distance</b> estimation. In addition, qualitative conclusions were made regarding the effect of atmospheric conditions on possible events. Thus, wind velocity was found to dominate during a jet fire event suppressing the thermal radiation effect, whereas gas dispersion was found to be affected mainly by solar radiation that favors the faster dissolution of fuel gas below the lower flammable limit.

A judgment of <b>safety</b> <b>distance</b> is {{a crucial part of}} a rear-end collision avoidance system which relies on <b>safety</b> <b>distance</b> model. In order to solve the problems of traditional <b>safety</b> <b>distance</b> models, this paper proposes a new model to avoid rear-end collisions. The new model considers the braking performance of the host vehicle and the motion state of the heading vehicle. Then a rear-end collision avoidance system including the new model is established using a combination of CarSim with Simulink software. Three typical working conditions through the co-simulation is simulated for verifying the model. Simulation results show that the new model ensures rear-end collision can be avoided, meanwhile keeping a short relative distance that improves road efficiency...|$|R

An evaluation of spray drift data of standard and drift reducing techniques in orchard spraying is analysed for spray drift deposition to the soil and airborne spray drift next to the orchard.

40|$|For {{activities}} with increased safety, like nuclear power plants, {{it is important}} to investigate a proper <b>safety</b> <b>distance</b> from a fire with known characteristics. Depending on the ignition temperature and thermal properties such as the thermal conductivity k, density ρ and specific heat capacity C for the surrounding material, different <b>safety</b> <b>distances</b> will be derived. This can be made by investigating the temperature and incoming radiation to a surface. There are several different ways to determine the temperature and radiation like computer programs, hand calculations or performing a full-scale experiment. The aim of this thesis is to determine the adiabatic surface temperature (AST) and radiation at different distances from a fire with a given effect, resulting in a <b>safety</b> <b>distance.</b> This will be made by examine differences in results between full-scale experiments, an excel-application based on hand-calculations and the computer programme Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). The excel-application calculates the incident radiation and the AST. The hand-calculations that are used in the excel-application are based on different parameters and formulas, such as the combustion efficiency of the flame, how sooty the flame is and the view factor. Three different full-scale experiments are made at SP Fire Research in Borås which are based on an earlier written report which used FDS to determine a <b>safety</b> <b>distance.</b> These three experiments were: a flame freely placed in a room, flame against a wall and flame in a corner. Several 30 mm insulated plate thermometers were used during these experiments on different heights to get the AST. The propane burner had an effect of 500 kW and a <b>safety</b> <b>distance</b> was measured based on chosen criteria. These criteria’s were met when the temperature of the instrument reached 205 °C or was exposed to an incident radiation of 6 kW/m 2. This temperature and incident radiation is based on research done by Electric Power Research institute (EPRI) [1]. The values are damage criteria’s identified for when ignition is identified on thermoplastic cables. For the full-scale experiments a significantly higher temperature was achieved when the burner was placed next to a wall or a corner compared to when the burner was placed freely. There was no bigger temperature difference if the burner was placed against a wall or a corner. The results from the excel-application corresponded well to the full-scale experiments and therefore similar <b>safety</b> <b>distances</b> were given. For the full-scale experiments the <b>safety</b> <b>distance</b> was reached at a distance of 0. 85 - 1. 35 m {{from the edge of the}} burner for the free flame and 1. 85 m when the flame was placed against a wall or when the flame was placed in the corner. For the excel-application the <b>safety</b> <b>distances</b> were 1. 2 m respectively 2. 0 m for the free flame and the flame against the wall. No calculations were made for flame in corner due to the fact that there was no remarkable temperature difference compared to the flame against the wall. These results can be compared to FDS where the <b>safety</b> <b>distances</b> were the same for all cases, 1. 5 m. Validerat; 20151006 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
