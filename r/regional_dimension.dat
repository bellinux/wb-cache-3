500|$|In the event, a {{full-scale}} {{civil war between}} [...] "Arabs" [...] and [...] "Berbers" [...] erupted in 898, prompting the dispatch of Ibrahim II's son Abu'l-Abbas Abdallah, who had previously suppressed the rebellion in Iriqiya, to the island {{at the head of}} an army in summer 900. By then, the Muslims' infighting had acquired a <b>regional</b> <b>dimension,</b> with the Palermitans pitted against the Agrigentans. After negotiations between the Ifriqiyans and the rival Sicilian parties failed, Abu'l-Abbas Abdallah marched on Palermo, which he captured on 18 September 900. A great number of the rebels fled the city to the Byzantines in Taormina, with some reaching even Constantinople itself.|$|E

We find that budgetary pressures were not the primary motivation for the recent changes, nor were old forms of social provision fully abolished. Monetisation launched a process that shifts responsibility for well-being onto individuals and institutionalises the spatial differentiation of welfare provision...|$|R

Regional innovation systems are analytically and empirically assessed within the policy corltext of the Lisbon strategy, with special reference to <b>regional</b> <b>dimensions</b> in the European Research Area. From both theoretical and empirical analysis it is concluded that RLS is not a one-dimensional concept. Although we adhere to RIS arguments as important determinaruts in economic development, the analyses presented in this article point out that the role of regíonal innovative capabilities must not be overemphasized. Economic development is in first instance dependent on national conlext...|$|R

50|$|The 1968 Buchanan Report was a {{significant}} report on the <b>regional</b> <b>dimension</b> to economic planning which had largely been ignored. The report, prepared by Colin Buchanan, a British town planner, investigated and recommended on {{the social and economic}} sustainability of industry in the regions. The reports recommended a limited number of development centres throughout Ireland, which would have a minimum self-sustaining size. This became quite controversial as there were fewer than a dozen of such places recommended. In the end local politics and patronage won out and the report was largely dropped with industry being ineffectively dispersed as local need arose.|$|E
