40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss a {{periodic}} <b>review</b> <b>control</b> policy for general N-echelon distribution networks without batch size or capacity constraints. Only stockpoints {{at the end of the}} network are allowed to hold stock, whereas the intermediate stockpoints act as pure distribution centers that allocate incoming goods immediately to downstream stockpoints. Larger distribution networks (N = 3, 4, 5) are often encountered in practice and therefore suitable inventory management policies are needed. Instead of defining a cost structure, we apply a service level approach where the main goal is to realize predetermined target service levels in the final stockpoints. A fast and accurate approximation method is presented which enables us to compute the parameters of the control policy; i. e. the system order-up-to-level and the allocation fractions for the allocation policy at the intermediate stockpoints. Finally, some attention is given to the important phenomenon of imbalance, which is caused by highly fluctuating demand processes at the final stockpoints. This phenomenon can affect the service performance of the developed control policy significantly...|$|E

In this paper, we <b>review</b> <b>control</b> techniques developed for managing tether dynamics, and discuss the results of using these techniques for the Tethered Satellite System's maiden flight on STS- 46. In particular, the flight results of controlling libration dynamics, string dynamics, and slack tether are presented. These results show that tether dynamics can be safely managed. The overall stability of the system {{was found to be}} surprisingly good even at relatively short tether lengths. In fact, the system operated in passive mode at a tether length of 256 meters for over 9 hours. Only monitoring of the system was required during this time. Although flight anomalies prevented the planned deployment to 20 km, the extended operations at shorter tether lengths have proven the viability of using tethers in space. These results should prove invaluable in preparing for future missions with tethered objects in space...|$|E

40|$|Among the parasites {{that affect}} pigs, Ascaris suum stands out for causing the {{greatest}} losses to livestock production systems. This parasite can be monitored during {{the slaughter of}} animals through the identification of &# 8220;milk spots&# 8221; or white patches on the liver caused by its larval migration. However, infection in the herd is usually subclinical, {{which is why the}} presence of this parasite in industrial pig production has been overlooked. The aim of the study was therefore to evaluate the occurrence of milk spots on the liver of animals slaughtered in the micro-region of Ponte Nova in the Zona da Mata - Minas Gerais, Brazil, and to associate these lesions with the time of year, herd size and source of origin of the animals. An evaluation was made of 1, 069 lots, totaling 108, 073 animals, based on data extracted from the Federal Inspection Service.

40|$|The {{control of}} {{diabetes}} is an interdisciplinary endeavor, {{which includes a}} significant biomedical engineering component, with traditions of success {{beginning in the early}} 1960 s. It began with modeling of the insulin-glucose system, and progressed to large-scale in silico experiments, and automated closed-loop control (artificial pancreas). Here, we follow these engineering efforts through the last, almost 50 years. We begin with the now classic minimal modeling approach and discuss a number of subsequent models, which have recently resulted in the first in silico simulation model accepted as substitute to animal trials in the quest for optimal diabetes control. We then review metabolic monitoring, with a particular emphasis on the new continuous glucose sensors, on the analyses of their time-series signals, and on the opportunities that they present for automation of diabetes control. Finally, we <b>review</b> <b>control</b> strategies that have been successfully employed in vivo or in silico, presenting a promise {{for the development of a}} future artificial pancreas and, in particular, discuss a modular architecture for building closed-loop control systems, including insulin delivery and patient safety supervision layers.

40|$|Abstract: Network {{congestion}} control remains {{a critical issue}} and a high priority, especially given the growing size, demand, and speed (bandwidth) of the increasingly integrated services networks. Designing effective {{congestion control}} strategies for these networks {{is known to be}} difficult because of the complexity {{of the structure of the}} networks, nature of the services supported, and the variety of the dynamic parameters involved. In addition to these, the uncertainties involved in identification of the network parameters lead to the difficulty of obtaining realistic, cost effective, analytical models of these networks. This renders the application of classical control system design methods (which rely on availability of these models) very hard, and possibly not cost effective. Consequently, a number of researchers are looking at alternative nonanalytical control system design and modeling schemes that have the ability to cope with these difficulties in order to devise effective, robust congestion control techniques as an alternative (or supplement) to traditional control approaches. These schemes employ artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems, and design methods based on evolutionary computation (collectively known as Computational Intelligence). In this chapter we firstly discuss the difficulty of the congestion control problem and <b>review</b> <b>control</b> approaches currently in use, before we motivate the utility of Computational Intelligence based control. Then, through a number of examples, we illustrate congestion control methods based on fuzzy control, artificial neural networks and evolutionary computation. Finally, some concluding remarks and suggestions for further work are given. 1...|$|E
40|$|Stochastic {{understanding}} of probability distribution undergirds development of conceptual connections between probability and statistics and supports {{development of a}} principled {{understanding of}} statistical inference. This study investigated the impact of an instructional course intervention designed to support development of stochastic understanding of probability distribution. Instructional supports consisted of supplemental lab assignments comprised of anticipatory tasks designed to engage students in coordinating thinking about complementary probabilistic and statistical notions. These tasks utilized dynamic software simulations to elicit stochastic conceptions and to support development of conceptual connections between empirical distributions and theoretical probability distribution models along a hypothetical learning trajectory undergirding stochastic understanding of probability distribution. The study employed a treatment-control design, using a mix of quantitative and qualitative research methods to examine students' understanding after a one-semester course. Participants were 184 undergraduate students enrolled in a lecture/recitation, calculus-based, introductory probability and statistics course who completed lab assignments addressing either calculus <b>review</b> (<b>control)</b> or stochastic conceptions of probability distribution (treatment). Data sources consisted of a student background survey, a conceptual assessment, ARTIST assessment items, and final course examinations. Student interviews provided insight {{into the nature of}} students' reasoning and facilitated examination of validity of the stochastic conceptual assessment. Logistic regression analysis revealed completion of supplemental assignments designed to undergird development of stochastic conceptions had a statistically significant impact on students' understanding of probability distribution.

He then discusses a case at the root of English administrative law-Roberts v. Hopwood, a judgment issued in 1925. Williams proceeds to analyze administrative law development in England, including the doctrines of judicial <b>review,</b> <b>control</b> of administrative discretion, and the complementary, evolving doctrines of administrative discretion and judicial deference, as exemplified by the authoritative dissent in Liversidge v. Anderson. Williams also stresses the relationship between democratic ideals and judicial deference to the decisions of local authorities. He concludes by describing the ever-evolving nature of administrative law in England today, arguing that just as in the 1920 s, the underlying approach of the courts to questions in administrative law can only be interpreted by taking into account the multitude of circumstances from which such questions arise...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Home {{telemonitoring}} improves {{clinical outcomes}} but can generate {{large amounts of}} data. Automating data surveillance with clinical decision support could reduce the impact of translating these systems to clinical settings. We utilized time-motion methodology to measure the time spent on activities monitoring subjects {{in the two groups}} of a home spirometry telemonitoring randomized controlled trial: the manual nurse <b>review</b> (<b>control)</b> group and the automated review (intervention) group. These results are examined for potential workflow effects that could occur when the intervention translates to a clinical setting. Materials and Methods: Time motion is an established industrial engineering technique used to evaluate workflow by measuring the time of predefined, discrete tasks. Data were collected via direct observation of two research nurses by a single observer using the repetitive or snap-back timing method. All observed tasks were coded using a list of work activities defined and validated in an earlier study. Reliability data were collected during a 2 -h session with a secondary observer. Results: Reliability of the primary observer was established. During 35 h of data collection, a sample of 938 task observations were recorded and coded using 46 previously defined and 5 newly defined work activities. Between-group comparisons of activity time for subjects in the two study groups showed significantly more time spent on data review activities for the automated review group. Reclassification of the 51 observed activities identified 15 activities that would translate to a clinical setting, of which 5 represent potentially new activities. Conclusions: Implementing an intervention into a clinical setting could add work activities to the clinical workflow. Time-motion study of research personnel working with new clinical interventions provides a template for evaluating the workflow impact of these interventions prior to translation from a research to a clinical setting...|$|E

An interesting addition to the 2011 competition was an affordability contest. This contest was added to showcase homes that are within the price range of typical homebuyers. ^ Controls are a crucial to every Solar Decathlon entry and the INhome, Purdue 2 ̆ 7 s entry into the 2011 Solar Decathlon, was no exception. The INhome 2 ̆ 7 s control and monitoring equipment was designed using residentially available components for end user interaction, as well as commercial components for control and monitoring. ^ This paper will <b>review</b> <b>control</b> methods used for the INhome and other teams in the competition. Data provided by both the Department of Energy and rival teams leads to several interesting conclusions. First, the home automation market is fragmented, with many competing control platforms and limited levels of interactivity. Spending either too much of too little money on a home control system may lead to poor or complicated control. It was found that the more complex and expensive a system was, the less it performed. ^ Systems that educated users on electricity consumption were popular. Nearly half of the homes in the competition incorporated an energy monitoring system that would provide long-term usage trends. This type of feedback is essential for changing energy consumption patterns in a home. ...|$|E

Through this study control drivers {{critical for the}} {{sustainability of}} the REIPPP programme were identified and prioritised. As background sustainability was investigated on an international level and within the South African context. Control drivers are drivers that {{have a significant impact}} on the sustainability of the REIPPP programme and also have some level of controllability. These drivers were obtained and compiled based on appropriate literature. The Global Reporting Guideline (GRI) for sustainability was used as baseline for identifying control drivers. To further obtain and verify the relevant sustainability control drivers, input from the REIPPP programme’s key stakeholders were included in the research. The key stakeholders provided an impact and controllability rating via a questionnaire, which was used to prioritise the identified control drivers. Selected key stakeholder where requested to <b>review</b> <b>control</b> drivers that were identified and prioritised, providing the researcher a means of verifying the preliminary proposed control drivers. Obtaining a final list of prioritised control drivers critical for the sustainability of the REIPPP programme was achieved by integrating the drivers identified by the researcher, stakeholder selected alternative drivers and their self-suggested control drivers. The prioritised control drivers could be used to promote or control the sustainability of the REIPPP programme by addressing and/or supporting the control drivers having the most significant impact. The top 5 prioritised control drivers were selected to be used in an interview with high level key stakeholders. The interviewees provided their input on how these drivers could be supported or addressed to control or even promote the sustainability of the REIPPP programme. From the interview it was clear that the final list of prioritised control drivers was relevant and could influence the long-term sustainability of the REIPPP programme. Many insights were obtained which could provide significant role players, or even the South African Government, the guidance they need to take the REIPPP programme forward. Master...|$|E
