5|$|After Desha was elected, Relief legislators, {{who held}} {{majorities}} {{in both houses}} of the General Assembly, attempted to remove the offending judges from office. Failing to achieve the needed two-thirds majority, the legislature passed a reorganization act abolishing the Court of Appeals and replacing it with a new court. Desha appointed justices favoring relief. The original court continued to claim authority as the court of last <b>resort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state; during {{what became known as the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, both courts operated simultaneously, with both claiming legitimacy.

5|$|By {{the time}} they were ready for their first {{practical}} installation, they heard that one of their members, Girja Sharan, had obtained a grant to construct a dew condenser in Kothara, India. In April 2001, Sharan had incidentally noticed substantial condensation on the roof of a cottage at Toran Beach <b>Resort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arid coastal region of Kutch, where he was briefly staying. The following year, he investigated the phenomenon more closely and interviewed local people. Financed by the Gujarat Energy Development Agency and the World Bank, Sharan and his team went on to develop passive, radiative condensers for use in the arid coastal region of Kutch. Active commercialisation began in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the effects}} of Hudah, the cyclone was {{considered}} the worst to strike the Antalaha region in 20years. The towns of Maroantsetra and Andapa were also hit hard, with 60–70percent of homes in the latter destroyed. Maroantsetra, a coastal town, was flooded by the storm surge, and as a result seven people died. The commune of Mananara Nord was completely flooded by the storm. Other isolated villages could not be reached via road or telecommunications due to the storm. One of these cities was Sambava, which suffered from a lack of available telephone links since late on April2. One person died in Sambava. A <b>resort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town of Cap Est was flattened. Initial estimates indicated that Hudah caused at least 100,000people to become homeless.|$|E

5|$|Harveys Lake was accidentally {{discovered}} by Benjamin Harvey in 1781. The first settlers {{arrived at the}} lake in the 1790s and 1800s. Early industries in the area included lumbering and farming, but it became well known as a summer <b>resort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{latter part of the}} 1800s and into the 1900s. It was also used as a water supply in the early 1900s. However, the lake began to develop significant environmental problems in the 1960s and a total maximum daily load was created for it in 1994. Since 1968, the lake has been located in the borough of Harveys Lake.|$|E

5|$|Crittenden {{was drawn}} back into public service by the Old Court – New Court controversy. When {{legislation}} aimed at providing {{relief to the}} state's debtors was struck down by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, supporters of the legislation in the General Assembly passed a bill abolishing the Court and creating a new court, which they stocked with sympathetic justices. Opponents of the legislation held that the Assembly's action was unconstitutional, and for a time, both courts claimed authority as the court of last <b>resort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state. Though he had {{served as president of}} the New Court-backed Bank of the Commonwealth since its formation in 1820, Crittenden publicly identified himself with the Old Court supporters in April 1825. In the legislative election of 1825, friends called on Crittenden to seek election to the state House of Representatives. Many believed that he was the only Old Court supporter that commanded enough respect to win one of the two seats allotted to Franklin County, a bastion of the New Court. When Crittenden consented to run, New Court supporters nominated the state's Attorney General Solomon P. Sharp and Lewis Sanders, a prominent lawyer. Crittenden and Sharp were elected to the two seats.|$|E

The same year, Mirage Resorts president Steve Wynn proposed a new casino <b>resort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> marina district, and stated that resort would not be built unless there was better access to the site. Additional plans were later researched, and six different plans were proposed. The plans included the tunnel underneath Horace J.

Transportation officials determined all of the plans, except for the first two tunnel proposals, to have significant drawbacks.|$|E
