Commercially produced torque-free <b>ring</b> <b>spun</b> cotton yarn was used for manufacturing denim fabric. One specimen of denim fabric had torque-free <b>ring</b> <b>spun</b> yarn in the warp direction and conventional <b>ring</b> <b>spun</b> yarn in the weft direction while the other had normal conventional <b>ring</b> <b>spun</b> yarn in both warp and weft directions.

40|$|Exact {{ground state}} {{properties}} of antiferromagnetic Heisenberg <b>spin</b> <b>rings</b> with isotropic next neighbour interaction are presented for various numbers of spin sites and spin quantum numbers. Earlier work by Peierls, Marshall, Lieb, Schultz and Mattis focused on bipartite lattices {{and is not}} applicable to rings with an odd number of spins. With the help of exact diagonalization methods we find a more general systematic behaviour which for instance relates the number of spin sites and the individual spin quantum numbers to the degeneracy of the ground state. These numerical findings all comply with rigorous proofs in the cases where a general analysis could be carried out. Therefore it can be plausibly conjectured that the ascertained properties hold for ground states of arbitrary antiferromagnetic Heisenberg <b>spin</b> <b>rings.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 5 figures, uses epsfig. sty, submitted to Phys.
