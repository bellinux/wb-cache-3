25|$|The {{definitions}} {{given in}} this section all relate to locations on the <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> but the first two auxiliary latitudes, like the geodetic latitude, can be extended to define a three-dimensional geographic coordinate system as discussed below. The remaining latitudes are not used in this way; they are used only as intermediate constructs in map projections of the <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> to the plane or in calculations of geodesics on the ellipsoid. Their numerical values are not of interest. For example, no one would need to calculate the authalic latitude of the Eiffel Tower.|$|E
25|$|The {{geodetic}} latitude, {{or any of}} {{the auxiliary}} latitudes defined on the <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoid,</b> constitutes with longitude a two-dimensional coordinate system on that ellipsoid. To define the position of an arbitrary point it is necessary to extend such a coordinate system into three dimensions. Three latitudes are used in this way: the geodetic, geocentric and reduced latitudes are used in geodetic coordinates, spherical polar coordinates and ellipsoidal coordinates respectively.|$|E

25|$|The north Atlantic is {{characterized}} by strong, large-scale anomalies of the gravity field and the geoid. The geoid rises up to 70 m above the geodetic <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> in an approximately circular area with a diameter of several hundred kilometers. In {{the context of the}} plume hypothesis, this has been explained by the dynamic effect of the upwelling plume which bulges up the surface of the Earth. Furthermore, the plume and the thickened crust cause a positive gravity anomaly of about 60 mGal (=0.0006m/s²) (free-air).|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{irregularity}} of the Earth's true gravity field, {{the equilibrium}} figure of sea water, or the geoid, {{will also be}} of irregular form. In some places, like west of Ireland, the geoid—mathematical mean sea level—sticks {{out as much as}} 100 m above the regular, rotationally symmetric <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> of GRS80; in other places, like close to Ceylon, it dives under the ellipsoid by nearly the same amount. The separation between these two surfaces is called the undulation of the geoid, symbol , and is closely related to the disturbing potential.|$|E

50|$|Traditional <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoids</b> or {{geodetic}} datums {{are defined}} regionally and therefore non-geocentric, e.g., ED50. Modern geodetic datums are established withthe aid of GPS and will therefore be geocentric, e.g., WGS 84.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{the reason}} for the [...] "long life" [...] of former <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoids</b> like the Hayford or the Bessel ellipsoid, despite the fact that their main axes deviate by several hundred meters from the modern values. Another reason is a {{judicial}} one: the coordinates of millions of boundary stones should remain fixed for a long period. If their reference surface changes, the coordinates themselves also change.|$|R
2500|$|The {{importance}} of specifying the reference datum may be illustrated {{by a simple}} example. On the <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> for WGS84, {{the centre of the}} Eiffel Tower has a geodetic latitude of 48°51′29″N, or 48.8583°N and longitude of 2°17′40″E or 2.2944°E. The same coordinates on the datum ED50 define a point on the ground which is [...] distant from the tower. A web search may produce several different values for the latitude of the tower; the <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> is rarely specified.|$|E
2500|$|The reduced {{latitude}} {{can also be}} extended to a three-dimensional coordinate system. For a point [...] not on the <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> (semi-axes [...] and [...] ) construct an auxiliary ellipsoid which is confocal (same foci , [...] ) with the reference ellipsoid: the necessary condition is that the product [...] of semi-major axis and eccentricity {{is the same for}} both ellipsoids. Let [...] be the semi-minor axis (...) of the auxiliary ellipsoid. Further let [...] be the {{reduced latitude}} of [...] on the auxiliary ellipsoid. The set [...] define the ellipsoid coordinates. These coordinates are the natural choice in models of the gravity field for a uniform distribution of mass bounded by the <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoid.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{difference}} in co-ordinates between datums is {{commonly referred to}} as datum shift. The datum shift between two particular datums can vary {{from one place to another}} within one country or region, and can be anything from zero to hundreds of meters (or several kilometers for some remote islands). The North Pole, South Pole and Equator will be in different positions on different datums, so True North will be slightly different. Different datums use different interpolations for the precise shape and size of the Earth (<b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoids).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{scale factor}} is unity on the equator, {{as it must}} be since the {{cylinder}} is tangential to the ellipsoid at the equator. The ellipsoidal correction of the scale factor increases with latitude but it is never greater than e2, a correction of less than 1%. (The value of e2 is about 0.006 for all <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoids.)</b> This is {{much smaller than the}} scale inaccuracy, except very close to the equator. Only accurate Mercator projections of regions near the equator will necessitate the ellipsoidal corrections.|$|R

50|$|The Pythagorean {{concept of}} a spherical Earth offers a simple surface that is mathematically easy to deal with. Many astronomical and navigational {{computations}} {{use it as a}} surface representing the Earth. While the sphere is a close approximation of the true figure of the Earth and satisfactory for many purposes, to the geodesists interested in the measurement of long distances on the scale of continents and oceans, a more exact figure is necessary. Closer approximations range from modelling the shape of the surface of the entire Earth as an oblate spheroid or an oblate ellipsoid, to the use of spherical harmonics or local approximations in terms of local <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoids.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Since {{there are}} many {{different}} reference ellipsoids, the precise latitude of a feature on the surface is not unique: this is stressed in the ISO standard which states that [...] "without the full specification of the coordinate reference system, coordinates (that is latitude and longitude) are ambiguous at best and meaningless at worst". This is of great importance in accurate applications, such as a Global Positioning System (GPS), but in common usage, where high accuracy is not required, the <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> is not usually stated.|$|E
2500|$|In geodesy, a {{meridian}} {{arc measurement}} is {{the distance between}} two points with the same longitude, i.e., a segment of a meridian curve or its length. Two or more such determinations at different locations then specify {{the shape of the}} [...] <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> which best approximates the shape of the geoid. This process is called the determination of the Figure of the Earth. The earliest determinations of the size of a spherical Earth required a single arc. The latest determinations use astro-geodetic measurements and the methods of satellite geodesy to determine the reference ellipsoids.|$|E

5000|$|The {{shape of}} an (oblate) {{ellipsoid}} (of revolution) {{is determined by the}} shape parameters of that ellipse which generates the ellipsoid when it is rotated about its minor axis. The semi-major axis of the ellipse, a, is identified as the equatorial radius of the ellipsoid: the semi-minor axis of the ellipse, b, is identified with the polar distances (from the centre). These two lengths completely specify the shape of the ellipsoid but in practice geodesy publications classify <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoids</b> by giving the semi-major axis and the inverse flattening, , The flattening, f, is simply a measure of how much the symmetry axis is compressed relative to the equatorial radius: For the Earth, f is around [...] corresponding to a difference of the major and minor semi-axes of approximately 21 km.

40|$|Hydrographic {{surveys are}} {{referenced}} vertically {{to a local}} water level “chart” datum. Conducting a survey relative to the ellipsoid dictates a datum transformation take place before the survey is used for current navigational products. Models that combine estimates for the tide, sea surface topography, the geoid, and the ellipsoid are often used to transform an <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>referenced</b> survey to a local water level datum. Regions covered by these vertical datum transformation models are limited and so would appear to constrain the areas where <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>referenced</b> surveys can be conducted. Because areas not covered by a vertical datum transformation model still must have a tide model to conduct a hydrographic survey, survey‐ time measurements of the ellipsoid to water level datum can be conducted through the vessel reference point. This measured separation is largely {{a function of the}} vessel ellipsoid height and the standard survey tide model and thus introduces limited additional uncertainty than is typical in a water level referenced survey. This approach is useful for reducing <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>reference</b> surveys to the water level datum, examining a tide model, or for evaluating a vertical datum transformation model. Prototype tools and a comparison to typical vertical datum transformation models are discussed...|$|R
2500|$|In {{general the}} true {{vertical}} {{at a point}} on the surface does not exactly coincide with either the normal to the <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> or the normal to the geoid. The angle between the astronomic and geodetic normals is usually {{a few seconds of}} arc but it is important in geodesy. The reason why it differs from the normal to the geoid is, because the geoid is an idealized, theoretical shape [...] "at mean sea level". Points on the real surface of the earth are usually above or below this idealized geoid surface and here the true vertical can vary slightly. Also, the true vertical at a point at a specific time is influenced by tidal forces, which the theoretical geoid averages out.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{different}} reference ellipsoids {{have been}} used in the history of geodesy. In pre-satellite days they were devised to give a good fit to the geoid over the limited area of a survey but, with the advent of GPS, it has become natural to use reference ellipsoids (such as WGS84) with centre at the centre of mass of the Earth and minor axis aligned to the rotation axis of the Earth. These geocentric ellipsoids are usually within [...] of the geoid. Since latitude is defined with respect to an ellipsoid, the position of a given point is different on each ellipsoid: one cannot exactly specify the latitude and longitude of a geographical feature without specifying the ellipsoid used. Many maps maintained by national agencies are based on older ellipsoids, so one must know how the latitude and longitude values are transformed from one ellipsoid to another. GPS handsets include software to carry out datum transformations which link WGS84 to the local <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> with its associated grid.|$|E
50|$|The {{surface of}} the geoid {{is higher than the}} <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> {{wherever}} there is a positive gravity anomaly (mass excess) and lower than the <b>reference</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> wherever there is a negative gravity anomaly (mass deficit).|$|E

Practicing surveyors will therefore encounter Helmert orthometric heights computed from Global Positioning System (GPS) ellipsoid heights and geoid heights determined from geoid models as their published vertical control coordinate, rather than adjusted orthometric heights determined by spirit leveling.
