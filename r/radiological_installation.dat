40|$|The {{research}} {{was conducted on the}} linearity of the output radiation in the mobile X-ray by using Piranha. This study aimed to measure the radiation dose exposure, to determine the relationship between the increase in the voltage of the radiation dose exposure and increase the tube current to the radiation dose exposure, as well as to analyze the radiation output and linearity of the output radiation. Data collection was conducted at the Dr. Tadjuddin Chalid Hospital Makassar in <b>radiological</b> <b>installation.</b> In this study the variables that measured the radiation dose and exposure variables that change the tube current and voltage. The data obtained and analyzed to calculate the value of the output radiation and radiation output linearity in the X- ray mobile. The analysis showed that the X-ray mobile with GE brand that are in <b>radiological</b> <b>installation</b> Dr. Tadjuddin Chalid Hospital has good linearity...|$|E
40|$|Background : The high use of {{radiation}} for medical activities is {{the contribution of}} the second largest source {{of radiation}} we receive. Besides radiation gives benefits, it can also cause danger for radiation workers, people, and the environment. So that radiology services should pay attention to safety aspects of radiation according to Peraturan Kepala BAPETEN No. 8 in 2011. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the application and implementation of radiation safety in Department of Radiology, Pulmonary Special Hospital Hospital, South Sumatra. Methods : A descriptive research with a qualitative approach was implemented in this study. Methods for obtaining information were in-depth interview, observation technique, and document review. Source of information was obtained from six informants, one of them was a key informant. Results : The results showed that implementation of radiation safety in Department of Radiology was not optimal. The other findings were the absence of radiation protection organization structure, lack of training for radiation workers, no radiologist, lack of availability of radiation protection equipment. Moreover, the results of worker radiation film badge has not yet been reported continuously to Batan, health monitoring has not yet been done specially for radiographers, lack of supervision or fast responsiveness to issues of Radiology at the hospital, as well as lack of coordination between the hospitals with <b>radiological</b> <b>installations.</b> Conclusion : It is concluded overview of the application of radiation safety at the Hospital for Special Pulmonary South Sumatra province have increased the awareness of the importance of safety for each radiation worker and also in terms of coordination between hospitals and radiology installations. Expected to be formed for SSR Lung structure and functioning of the organization of radiation protection, giving a reprimand or sanctions for employees who do not work in accordance with the SOP, specific medical examination immediately, and make plans for the training of radiographers. Key words : Application of Radiation Safety, Radiology, Hospital...|$|R
