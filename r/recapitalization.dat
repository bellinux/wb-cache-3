40|$|Abstract. Exploiting the Japanese banking {{crisis as}} a laboratory, we provide firm-level {{evidence}} on the real effects of bank bailouts. Government <b>recapitalizations</b> result in positive abnormal returns for the clients of recapitalized banks. After <b>recapitalizations,</b> banks extend larger loans to their clients and some firms increase investment, but do not create more jobs than comparable firms. Most importantly, <b>recapitalizations</b> allow banks to extend larger loans to low and high quality firms alike, and low quality firms experience higher abnormal returns than other firms. Interestingly, <b>recapitalizations</b> by private investors have similar effects. Moreover, bank mergers engineered to enhance bank stability appear to hurt the borrowers of the sounder banks involved in the mergers...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine whether}} sharp debt {{increases}} through leveraged buyouts and <b>recapitalizations</b> interact with market structure to influence plant closing and investment decisions of recapitalizing firms and their rivals. We {{take into account}} the fact that <b>recapitalizations</b> and investment decisions are both endogenous and may be simultaneously influenced by the same exogenous events. Following their <b>recapitalizations,</b> firms in industries with high concentration are more likely to close plants and less likely to invest. Rival firms are less likely to close plants and more likely to invest when the market share of leveraged firms is higher. We are grateful to David Denis, Owen Lamont, Peter MacKay, Vojislav Maksimovic...|$|R
5|$|A week later, on April 13, Liberty Property Trust sold an 80-percent {{interest}} in the Comcast Center to German real estate firm CommerzLeasing & Immobilien AG, a subsidiary of Commerzbank AG. The deal completed Liberty Property Trust's planned <b>recapitalization</b> of the anticipated cost of the building, {{and the value of}} the joint venture, called Liberty/Commerz 1701 JFK Boulevard L.P., included mortgage debt and equity.|$|E
5|$|Return to {{economic}} growth and improved structural deficits enabled Ireland and Portugal to exit their bailout programmes in July 2014. Greece and Cyprus both managed to partly regain market access in 2014. Spain never officially received a bailout programme. Its rescue package from the ESM was earmarked for a bank <b>recapitalization</b> fund and did not include financial support for the government itself.|$|E
5|$|The European {{debt crisis}} {{erupted in the}} wake of the Great Recession around late 2009, and was {{characterized}} by an environment of overly high government structural deficits and accelerating debt levels. When, as a negative repercussion of the Great Recession, the relatively fragile banking sector had suffered large capital losses, most states in Europe had to bail out several of their most affected banks with some supporting <b>recapitalization</b> loans, because of the strong linkage between their survival and the financial stability of the economy. As of January 2009, a group of 10 central and eastern European banks had already asked for a bailout. At the time, the European Commission released a forecast of a 1.8% decline in EU economic output for 2009, making the outlook for the banks even worse. The many public funded bank recapitalizations were one reason behind the sharply deteriorated debt-to-GDP ratios experienced by several European governments {{in the wake of}} the Great Recession. The main root causes for the four sovereign debt crises erupting in Europe were reportedly a mix of: weak actual and potential growth; competitive weakness; liquidation of banks and sovereigns; large pre-existing debt-to-GDP ratios; and considerable liability stocks (government, private, and non-private sector).|$|E

25|$|Assets of {{the largest}} 1,000 banks in the world grew by 6.8% in the 2008/2009 {{financial}} year to a record US$96.4trillion while profits declined by 85% to US$115billion. Growth in assets in adverse market conditions was largely a result of <b>recapitalization.</b> EU banks held the largest share of the total, 56% in 2008/2009, down from 61% in the previous year. Asian banks' share increased from 12% to 14% during the year, while the share of US banks increased from 11% to 13%. Fee revenue generated by global investment banking totalled US$66.3billion in 2009, up 12% on the previous year.|$|E
25|$|In 1928 Baldwin {{began an}} attempt to diversify its product line to include small {{internal}} combustion-electric locomotives but the Great Depression thwarted these efforts, eventually leading Baldwin to declare bankruptcy in 1935. At the invitation of {{the owners of the}} Geo D. Whitcomb Company, a small manufacturer of gasoline and diesel industrial locomotives in Rochelle, Illinois, Baldwin agreed to participate in a <b>recapitalization</b> program, purchasing about half of the issued stock. By March 1931 the small firm was in financial trouble and Baldwin filed a voluntary bankruptcy for Whitcomb with Baldwin gaining complete control and creating a new subsidiary, the Whitcomb Locomotive Company. This action would lead to financial losses, an ugly court battle between Baldwin and William Whitcomb, the former owner of the company, and bankruptcy for both parties.|$|E
25|$|China's banking {{sector is}} {{dominated}} by four large state-owned banks, which are largely inefficient and monopolistic. China's largest bank, ICBC, is the largest bank in the world. The financial sector is widely seen as a drag on the economy due to the inefficient state management. Non-performing loans, mostly made to local governments and unprofitable state-owned enterprises for political purposes, especially the political goal of keeping unemployment low, are a big drain on the financial system and economy, reaching over 22% of GDP by 2000, with a drop to 6.3% by 2006 due to government <b>recapitalization</b> of these banks. In 2006, {{the total amount of}} non-performing loans was estimated at $160billion. Observers recommend privatization of the banking system to solve this problem, a move that was partially carried out when the four banks were floated on the stock market. China's financial markets, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange, are relatively ineffective at raising capital, as they comprise only 11% of GDP.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} how government interventions such as blanket guarantees, liquidity support, <b>recapitalizations,</b> and nationalizations affect banking competition. This issue {{is critical for}} stability, access to finance, and economic growth. Exploiting cross-country and cross-time variation in the timing of interventions and accounting for their nonrandomness, we document that liquidity support, <b>recapitalizations,</b> and nationalizations trigger large increases in competition. We also find some more nuanced evidence that zombie banks’ market shares in crisis countries evolve together with interventions. A higher frequency of interventions coincides with greater zombie bank presence, and increases in competition are larger when zombie banks occupy bigger market shares...|$|R
