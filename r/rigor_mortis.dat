5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis</b> could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis</b> passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis</b> had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
5|$|Jourgensen seemed {{particularly}} fond of thrash metal. After {{the release}} of Land, he recruited guitarist Mike Scaccia from Texas thrashers <b>Rigor</b> <b>Mortis.</b> On one occasion, Jourgensen told the press that Sepultura was his favorite band. He also expressed the desire to produce a Metallica album. Jourgensen's interest in dance-oriented electronic music did not entirely fade, however; he also formed the side-project Revolting Cocks, a more electronic body music-inflected collaboration with Richard 23 of Front 242.|$|E
5|$|Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{continue}} their struggling {{investigation into the}} murder of 11-year-old Adena Watson. Bayliss wants to question an arabber who he maintains is the killer, but Pembleton believes that lead has already been exhausted. Pembleton instead pursues a theory posed by Felton (Daniel Baldwin) that Watson was killed one day earlier than they first believed, and <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis</b> was slowed because her body was stored in a cool place. Felton and Pembleton identify a possible suspect who lived near the murder scene, and learn his car was impounded shortly after her body was found. As they search impound lots for the car, the two detectives bicker {{with each other and}} Pembleton accuses Felton of racism. They eventually find the car, but uncover no evidence linking it to Watson.|$|E
5|$|A rocket-ship {{carrying}} astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) launches and orbits the Earth, {{marking the}} United States' first manned space launch. Shortly after taking off, {{the ship is}} struck by an unknown object, forcing Corcoran to abort the mission and land. However, the equipment cannot handle the fast descent back into the atmosphere and the ship crash lands in the woods, killing Corcoran. Dave Randall (Ed Nelson) and Donna Bixby (Georgianna Carter), two technicians from a nearby space agency tracking station, locate the crashed ship and recover Corcoran's body. They are baffled, however, by {{what appears to be}} a giant tear in the side of the destroyed spacecraft and a mud-like substance covering some of the wreckage. Randall and Bixby are joined by lead scientist Dr. Alex Wyman (Tyler McVey), technician Steve Dunlap (John Baer) and physician Julie Benson (Angela Greene), who was also Corcoran's fiancee. Wyman observes that Corcoran's body exhibits no signs of <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis,</b> and that the blood pooling beside him is not livid as it should be. The team brings the corpse back to their lab to run tests and find further irregularities. Although the body lacks a heartbeat or pulse, it maintains the blood pressure of a living human being. After looking at his blood in a microscope, they find unusual, unidentifiable cells that seem resistant to destruction from human white blood cells.|$|E
25|$|On December 23, 2012, guitarist Mike Scaccia died {{following}} an on-stage heart attack, while {{playing with his}} other band, <b>Rigor</b> <b>Mortis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Autopsies on drowned persons show no {{indications}} of these effects and {{there appears to}} be little difference between drownings in salt water and fresh water. After death, <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis</b> will set in and remains for about two days, depending on many factors, including water temperature.|$|E
25|$|At {{three o'clock}} p.m. on Monday at St. George's Mortuary, Dr. Blackwell and I made a post mortem examination. <b>Rigor</b> <b>mortis</b> was still {{thoroughly}} marked. There was mud {{on the left}} side of the face and it was matted in the head. The body was fairly nourished. Over both shoulders, especially the right, and under the collarbone and in front of the chest there was a bluish discoloration, which I have watched and have seen on two occasions since.|$|E
25|$|Inuit {{actually}} {{consume more}} carbohydrates than most nutritionists have assumed. Because {{some of the}} meat the Inuit eat is raw and fresh, or freshly frozen, they can obtain more carbohydrates from their meat, as dietary glycogen, than Westerners can. The Inuit practice of preserving a whole seal or bird carcass under an intact whole skin with {{a thick layer of}} blubber also permits some proteins to ferment, or hydrolyze, into carbohydrates. Furthermore, the blubber, organs, muscle and skin of the marine mammals that Inuit eat have significant glycogen stores, which assist those animals when oxygen is depleted on prolonged dives. For instance, when blubber is analyzed by direct carbohydrate measurements, it has been shown to contain as much as 8—30% carbohydrates. While postmortem glycogen levels are often depleted through the onset of <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis,</b> marine mammals have a much delayed onset of <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis,</b> even in warm conditions, presumably due to the high content of oxymyoglobin in the muscle that may permit aerobic metabolism to continue slowly for some time after the death of the animal. Additionally, in cold conditions, glycogen's depletion is halted at -18°C (-0.4°F) and lower temperatures in comminuted meat.|$|E
25|$|In {{one of the}} {{greatest}} doom metal outputs, Finnish groups focus more on the depressive mood of the genre, evoking an intense grieving feeling. The bands play with very slow tempos and melodic tones, creating an atmosphere of darkness and melancholia. This scene was kick-started by the band <b>Rigor</b> <b>Mortis</b> (which, due to an older US band with the same name, changed their name to Spiritus Mortis), which originated in 1987. Notable bands include Reverend Bizarre, Minotauri, Dolorian, Shape of Despair, Thergothon, Skepticism and Unholy.|$|E
25|$|The Entombment panel {{contains}} {{a scene from}} the biblical entombment of Christ, as Christ's body is lowered into a stone sarcophagus. His body is covered with a transparent shroud, his head with a white blood stained scarf. His body is rigid, showing the effects of <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis.</b> To the left of the tomb are the mourners Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, the Three Maries (Mary Magdalene, Mary of Clopas, and Mary, mother of Jesus). Above them is the dark, crouched figure St. John the Evangelist.|$|E
25|$|The British came {{face-to-face}} with the Talpurs {{at the battle of}} Miani on 17 February 1843. It is said that even in <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis</b> the Ameers (Mirs) held their swords high fighting the British. The battle ended on 24 March where the Mirs lost and the city came {{into the hands of the}} British. The battle at Dabo landed an even greater part of Sindh in the laps of the British regime and the city surrendered to the British. Being the last stronghold in the way of the British, the city once conquered, completed the British Conquest of Sindh.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{the muscle}} {{proteins}} denature in varying degree, {{with the exception}} of the collagen and elastin of connective tissue, and <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis</b> resolves. Because of these changes, the meat is tender and pliable when cooked just after death or after the resolution of rigor, but tough when cooked during rigor. As the muscle pigment myoglobin denatures, its iron oxidates, which may cause a brown discoloration near the surface of the meat. Ongoing proteolysis also contributes to conditioning. Hypoxanthine, a breakdown product of ATP, contributes to the meat's flavor and odor, as do other products of the decomposition of muscle fat and protein.|$|E
25|$|The initial steps {{towards the}} {{scientific}} study of the shroud were taken soon after the first set of black and white photographs became available early in the 20th century. In 1902 Yves Delage, a French professor of comparative anatomy, published the first study on the subject. Delage declared the image anatomically flawless and argued that the features of <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis,</b> wounds, and blood flows were evidence that the image was formed by direct or indirect contact with a corpse. William Meacham mentions several other medical studies between 1936 and 1981 that agree with Delage. However, these were all indirect studies without access to the shroud itself.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} day after death, {{glycolysis}} continues until the accumulation of lactic acid causes the pH to reach about 5.5. The remaining glycogen, about 18g per kg, is believed to increase the water-holding capacity and tenderness of the flesh when cooked. <b>Rigor</b> <b>mortis</b> sets {{in a few hours}} after death as ATP is used up, causing actin and myosin to combine into rigid actomyosin and lowering the meat's water-holding capacity, causing it to lose water ("weep"). In muscles that enter rigor in a contracted position, actin and myosin filaments overlap and cross-bond, resulting in meat that is tough on cooking – hence again the need to prevent pre-slaughter stress in the animal.|$|E
25|$|Recent DNA {{analyses}} {{claim they}} revealed traces of blood {{from at least}} four other people on his gear: one from his knife, two from the same arrowhead, and a fourth from his coat. Interpretations of these findings were that Ötzi killed two people with the same arrow, {{and was able to}} retrieve it on both occasions, and the blood on his coat was from a wounded comrade he may have carried over his back. Ötzi's posture in death (frozen body, face down, left arm bent across the chest) could support a theory that before death occurred and <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis</b> set in, the Iceman was turned onto his stomach in the effort to remove the arrow shaft.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Entwistle {{became the}} first member to release a solo album, Smash Your Head Against the Wall, which earned him a cult {{following}} in the US for fans of his brand of black humour. Other solo studio albums included: Whistle Rymes (1972), <b>Rigor</b> <b>Mortis</b> Sets In (1973), Mad Dog (1975), Too Late the Hero (1981), and The Rock (1996). In 1974, he compiled Odds & Sods, a collection of unreleased Who material. The band was preoccupied with recording The Who by Numbers {{during the spring of}} 1975 and did not do any touring for most of the year, so Entwistle spent the summer performing solo concerts. He also fronted the John Entwistle Band on US club tours during the 1990s, and appeared with Ringo Starr's All Starr Band in 1995. A talented artist, Entwistle held regular exhibitions of his paintings, with many of them featuring the Who.|$|E
500|$|Dead animals {{may appear}} to have been tipped over. But this is {{actually}} the process of <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis,</b> which stiffens the muscles of the carcass, beginning six to eight hours after death and lasting for one to two days. [...] It is particularly noticeable in the limbs, which stick out straight. [...] Post-mortem bloat also occurs because of gas formation inside the body. The process may result in cattle carcasses that wind up on their back with all four feet in the air.|$|E
500|$|Montagu {{considered}} {{that there would}} be a possible [...] "Roman Catholic prejudice against tampering with corpses", which could miss the documents stored in the corpse's pockets, so they added them to an official briefcase that would not be overlooked. To justify carrying documents in a briefcase, Major Martin was given two proof copies of the official pamphlet on combined operations written by the author Hilary Saunders – then on Mountbatten's staff – and a letter from Mountbatten to Eisenhower, asking him to write a brief foreword for the pamphlet's US edition. The planning team first thought of having the handle clutched in the corpse's hand, held in place by <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis,</b> but the rigor would probably wear off and the briefcase would drift away. They therefore equipped Martin with a leather-covered chain, such as was used by bank and jewellery couriers to secure their cases against snatching. The chain unobtrusively runs down a sleeve to the case. To Montagu it seemed unlikely that the major would keep the bag secured to his wrist during the long flight from Britain, so the chain was looped around the belt of his trench coat.|$|E

As a suspected suicide, no attempt to determine the correct time was made. As poisons affect the progression of rigor, 2 a.m. is probably inaccurate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mutilation}} of Kelly's corpse {{was by far}} {{the most}} extensive of any of the Whitechapel murders, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Dr. Thomas Bond and Dr. George Bagster Phillips examined the body. Phillips and Bond timed her death to about 12 hours before the examination. Phillips suggested that the extensive mutilations would have taken two hours to perform, and Bond noted that <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis</b> set in as they were examining the body, indicating that death occurred between 2 and 8:00a.m. Bond's notes read: ...|$|E

2500|$|John Farrar was {{the captain}} of the Edgartown Fire Rescue unit and diver who {{recovered}} Kopechne's body. He alleged that Kopechne died from suffocation rather than from drowning or from the impact of the overturned vehicle.

2500|$|The band {{suffered}} further line-up {{changes during}} this period, with Dewey Rowell leaving the band in 1991 {{and not being}} replaced until 1992 by Pete Lee, after the recording of America Must Be Destroyed. During this period, Gwar was (temporarily) banned in North Carolina because Brockie was wearing his [...] "Cuttlefish of Cthulhu" [...] codpiece, which led to his arrest; this incident was the inspiration for Gwar's third album, America Must Be Destroyed, released in 1992. The album was accompanied by the movie Phallus in Wonderland, which documented the main concept and contained music videos for the album. Phallus in Wonderland {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award in 1993. After recording for This Toilet Earth was completed, bassist Mike Bishop left the band. He was replaced by Casey Orr, from the band <b>Rigor</b> <b>Mortis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Jourgensen told Metal Hammer in August 2011 that Ministry {{was working}} on a new album called Relapse, which they hoped to release by Christmas.

I think this is actually gonna wind up being the fastest and heaviest record I've ever done. Just because we did it as anti-therapy therapy against the country music we would just take days off and thrash faster than I've done in a long time, faster than Mikey's done in a long time.

2500|$|Dwarves {{look like}} small humans, but are less {{proportional}} than elves. Dwarves have many abilities. They can unhinge their jaws to chew through earth extremely quickly. When digging they shovel the dirt into their mouth, digest it {{to remove any}} useful minerals, then (sometimes for self-defence or as a weapon) excrete the remnants. [...] Their spit glows {{in the dark and}} hardens once it leaves their mouths. Dwarf spittle is also a sedative, as seen in the fifth book, and is used to ward off evil spirits, as seen in the eighth book. Their hair can be used as keys because <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis</b> sets in once they pluck it off. When the hair is still attached to the dwarf, they can be used to detect vibrations. Since dwarves can drink water by absorbing it through their pores, if they go long enough without drinking, their pores create a vacuum effect, allowing them to stick to walls. Dwarves can use gas consumed in tunneling [...] to flatulate with colossal power (enough to knock out trolls). Their flatulence also is a by-product of a gas used for deep sea divers to prevent 'the bends'. They also have the gift of tongues. Dwarves are extremely sensitive to sunlight, and can burn after three minutes in the sun. They also hate fire and ice. Dwarves despise goblins as a general rule, and often erupt in s against them. Another ability was shown in , where Diggums touched his beard to a deep cut on his head, which resulted in the wound [...] "sewing" [...] itself together with only a scar left in its place. They are also shown in the seventh book with the ability to [...] "trim the weight", in which they rapidly mobilise their body fat as dwarf gas to rapidly escape dangerous situations. Dwarves can only use this ability every ten years, and it is usually triggered by great stress.|$|E

60|$|Indaba-zimbi lay on {{the ground}} like a person quite dead. His limbs had all the utter {{relaxation}} of death. But as I watched I saw them begin to stiffen, exactly as though <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis</b> had set in. Then, to my astonishment, I perceived them once more relax, and this time there appeared upon his chest the stain of decomposition. It spread and spread; in three minutes the man, to all appearance, was a livid corpse.|$|E
60|$|It always {{hung over}} the twisted, bulbous lead pipes below the {{stationary}} basin in the women's wash-room provided by the Septimus Building for the women on three floors. It was a rag ancient and slate-gray, grotesquely stiff and grotesquely hairy at its frayed edges--a corpse of a scrub-rag in <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis.</b> Una was annoyed with herself for ever observing so unlovely an object, but {{in the moment of}} relaxation when she went to wash her hands she was unduly sensitive to that eternal rag, and to the griminess of the wash-room--the cracked and yellow-stained wash-bowl, the cold water that stung in winter, the roller-towel which she spun round and round in the effort to find a dry, clean, square space, till, in a spasm of revulsion, she would bolt out of the wash-room with her face and hands half dried.|$|E
60|$|But {{what were}} we to begin to do in that {{graveyard}} of a world? Could ever men have been faced with such a question {{since the dawn of}} time? It is true that our own physical needs, and even our luxuries, were assured for the future. All the stores of food, all the vintages of wine, all the treasures of art were ours for the taking. But {{what were we}} to do? Some few tasks appealed to us at once, since they lay ready to our hands. We descended into the kitchen and laid the two domestics upon their respective beds. They seemed to have died without suffering, one in the chair by the fire, the other upon the scullery floor. Then we carried in poor Austin from the yard. His muscles were set as hard as a board in the most exaggerated <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis,</b> while the contraction of the fibres had drawn his mouth into a hard sardonic grin. This symptom was prevalent among all who had died from the poison. Wherever we went we were confronted by those grinning faces, which seemed to mock at our dreadful position, smiling silently and grimly at the ill-fated survivors of their race.|$|E
60|$|So {{much now}} for the bricks. I will tell later how we use {{cartridge}} paper and cardboard and other things to help in our and of the decorative make of plasticine. Of course, {{it goes without saying}} that we despise those foolish, expensive, made-up wooden and pasteboard castles that are sold in shops--playing with them is like playing with somebody else's dead game in a state of <b>rigor</b> <b>mortis.</b> Let me now say a little about toy soldiers and the world to which they belong. Toy soldiers used to be flat, small creatures in my own boyhood, in comparison with the magnificent beings one can buy to-day. There has been an enormous improvement in our national physique in this respect. Now they stand nearly two inches high and look you broadly in the face, and they have the movable arms and alert intelligence of scientifically exercised men. You get five of them mounted or nine afoot in a box for a small price. We three like those of British manufacture best; other makes are of incompatible sizes, and we have a rule that saves much trouble, that all red coats belong to G. P. W., and all other colored coats to F. R. W., all gifts, bequests, and accidents notwithstanding. Also we have sailors; but, since there are no red-coated sailors, blue counts as red.|$|E
