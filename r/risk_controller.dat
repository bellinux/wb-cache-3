40|$|Abstract. The authors {{discuss the}} {{approximation}} of Value at Risk (VaR) and other quantities relevant to risk management. One {{of the core}} problems {{in this context is}} the approximation of the distribution of quadratic forms of Gaussian vectors. It appears as an intermediate problem in the variance reduction techniques proposed by Glasserman et. al. as well as in so-called ∆-Γ-normal approaches. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show that sampling methods are faster than Fourier inversion for a range of practical problems. In fact, the asymptotic cost to achieve a given accuracy is O(d) for Monte-Carlo and O(d 3) for Fourier inversion in a specific setting. The theoretical results are supported by a case study based on real-life problems, showing that sampling methods are faster than Fourier inversion for all but the smallest problems. Thus the use of randomized methods is recommended and the issue of variance reduction becomes important. Stratification methods – especially randomized orthogonal arrays – turn out to lead to the most effec-tive methods in terms of accuracy per computational cost. 1. Problem formulation Given a portfolio, the typical task of a bank’s <b>risk</b> <b>controller</b> is to model the change in the portfolio’s value over a certain time horizon h in the future. If Sit denotes the value of asset i at time t and w i t the number of units of assets of type i in the portfolio, then V (wt, St) = M∑ i= 1 witS i t is the portfolio’s value at time t. The object of interest is the hypo-thetical profit or loss (P&L) from holding the frozen portfolio (wt) over the time interval [t, t+ h]...|$|E

40|$|Results from {{portfolio}} {{models for}} credit risk {{tell us that}} loan concentration in certain industry sectors can substantially increase the value-at-risk (V aR). The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyse if a very tractable “infection model ” can provide a meaningful estimate of the impact of concentration risk on the V aR. This would be achieved with quite parsimonious data requirements, which are comparable to those for Moody’s Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) and considerably lower than for a multi–factor model. The infection model extends the BET by introducing default infection into the hypothetical portfolio on which the real portfolio is mapped in order to retain a simple, closed–form solution for the V aR. The infection–probability is calibrated for a range of typical values of input parameters which capture the concentration of a portfolio in industry sectors, default dependencies between exposures and their credit quality. The accuracy of the new model is measured for test portfolios with a realistic industry–sector composition, obtained from the German central credit register. We find that a carefully calibrated infection model provides a reasonably close approximation to the V aR obtained from a multi–factor model. It out–performs by far the BET which we dismiss for its lack of accuracy. Pending further robustness checks we conclude that the calibrated infection model promises to provide a fit–for–purpose tool to measure concentration risk in business sectors that could be useful for internal <b>risk</b> <b>controllers</b> as well as banking supervisors...|$|R
40|$|Voltage source {{converter}} based multi-terminal DC (VSC-MTDC) {{system has}} raised {{great interest in}} academia and power industry. The maturing VSC technology has made such system possible for future medium and high voltage applications. Inspired {{by the success of}} DC based power distribution on electric ships, a number of VSC-MTDC systems have been proposed in literature for power grid innovation. However, there are still major technology obstacles to overcome before a VSC-MTDC grid come to utilization. Compared to the maturing technology on device level, research is still needed on the system and operation level. High dynamics and controllability of the VSC brings both opportunity and <b>risks.</b> <b>Controllers</b> must be carefully designed on grid level to fulfill multiple control objectives and coordinate local converter actions. This work provides a comprehensive solution for MTDC system from modeling to control design. The procedure and tool sets are designed to be applied to various system setups and control schemes, {{so that it can be}} applied to multiple MTDC applications. First, thorough study on the VSC-MTDC system is conducted through analytical modeling and simulation. A systematic modeling method for general VSC-MTDC system is proposed. It contains a two-stage procedure that is generalizable to arbitrary system setup and configuration. A small signal state space representation which includes local and network dynamics can be obtained. A novel reconfigurable controller concept is then proposed to address multiple control strategies and communication constraints in system level. Design of such controller is formulated into a standard LMI optimization problem so it can be efficiently solved even for large scale system. Using the proposed control design method, different control schemes can be easily explored through unified methodology and procedure. We demonstrated that existing control schemes for MTDC power balancing can be covered by this control structure. The proposed modeling and control design method is applied to four-terminal HVDC systems of multiple grid applications. Different control topologies and operation modes are evaluated and compared. Practical aspects such as LMI parameter tuning guideline and specifications for different applications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze {{the effect of the}} {{expropriation}} <b>risk</b> by <b>controller</b> shareholders and corporate governance (GCG) to the use level of bank loan owned by the company. The samples used in this study were the data 226 manufacturing companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange in period 2010 - 2012. The results showed that the magnitude of expropriation risk that could be done by controlling shareholders adversely affected the level of bank loan. This showed two things: in making loans to the company, banks considered the possibility of the expropriation. The companies that had the expropriation risk would have less loan to the bank because the company avoided scrutiny which was higher than banks. This study could not prove the influence of corporate governance on the level of bank loan. The result on the audit quality variable showed a positive correlation between KAP size and bank loan levels...|$|R

SSCI mitigation is achieved through the modification of the controller structure within the DFIG turbine. A proportional damping controller tuned to the SSCI oscillatory frequency is proposed and implemented in the current controller loop that regulates the rotor current of the DFIG, aiming at enhancing the system damping at the frequency of interest.

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} a stylized core-periphery financial network in which links {{lead to the}} creation of projects in the outside economy but make banks prone to contagion <b>risk.</b> The <b>controller</b> seeks to maximize, under budget constraints, the value of the financial system defined as the total amount of external projects. Under partial information on interbank links, revealed in conjunction with the spread of contagion, the optimal control problem is shown to become a Markov decision problem. We find the optimal intervention policy using dynamic programming. Our numerical results show that the value of the system depends on the connectivity in a non- monotonous way: it first increases with connectivity and then decreases with connectivity. The maximum value attained depends critically on the budget of the controller and the availability of an adapted intervention strategy. Moreover, we show that for highly connected systems, it is optimal to increase the rate of intervention in the peripheral banks rather than in core banks.

40|$|Abstract: In the {{automotive}} industry driving cycles {{have been used to}} evaluate vehicles in different perspectives. If a vehicle manufacturer focuses only on a fixed driving cycle there is a <b>risk</b> that <b>controllers</b> of the vehicle are optimized for a certain driving cycle and hence are sub-optimal solutions to real-world driving. To deal with this issue, it is beneficial to have a method for generating more driving cycles that in some sense are equivalent but not identical. The idea here is that these generated driving cycles have the same vehicle excitation in the mean tractive force, MTF. Using the individual force components of the MTF in the generation of driving cycles with Markov chains makes it possible to generate equivalent driving cycles that have the same vehicle excitation from real-world driving data. This is motivated since the fuel consumption estimation is more accurate when the MTF components are considered. The result is a new method that combines the generation of driving cycles using real-world driving cycles with the concept of equivalent driving cycles, and the results are promising...|$|R

To protect the battery, inclusion of a charge controller is recommended. A charge controller or battery regulator limits {{the rate at which the}} electric current is added to or drawn from electric batteries, prevents overcharging and may protect against overvoltage, which can reduce battery performance or lifespan and may pose a safety <b>risk.</b> A charge <b>controller</b> may also prevent the complete draining (‘deep discharging’) of a battery or perform controlled discharges, depending on the battery technology, to protect battery life [24].|$|R
30|$|To adapt power configuration, {{reactive}} approaches [56, 69] use a {{low threshold}} for CPU utilisation to switch nodes to sleep state. In contrast, proactive approaches predict workload utilisation and switch nodes to sleep {{state at the}} predicted time intervals. In [41], the authors used a Kalman filter to predict the number of requests. VM capability and power consumption were captured offline, by measuring the average response times achieved when different CPU shares {{were assigned to the}} VM. The authors modelled risk in the decision making to cater for the cost of switching nodes on and off, arguing this reduces SLA violations considerably compared to a non <b>risk</b> aware <b>controller.</b> Core to this argument is SLA violations, or opportunity cost, in having to power on a node. However, with commoditisation of Solid state storage (SSD), which offers significant boot performance compared to Hard disk drives, many servers use SSD to boot the operating system. The authors previous conclusions may need to be revisited to re-evaluate whether more nodes using SSD can be left in switched off mode and switched on nearer to the time they are needed. Similarly, [40, 53] proactively adjust the node frequency and eventually switch the node to sleep state.|$|R
40|$|New {{air traffic}} {{management}} concepts distribute the responsibility for traffic separation among the several actors of the aerospace system. As a consequence, these concepts move the safety <b>risk</b> from human <b>controllers</b> to the onboard software and hardware systems. One example of the new kind of distributed systems is air traffic conflict detection and resolution. Traditional methods for safety analysis such as human-in-the-loop simulations, testing, and flight experiments may not be sufficient in this highly distributed system: the set of possible scenarios is too large to have a reasonable coverage. This paper proposes a paradigm shift for the safety analysis of avionics systems where formal methods drive the development of critical systems. As {{a case study of}} this approach, we report the mechanical verification of an algorithm for air traffic conflict resolution and recovery...|$|R
40|$|Software-defined {{networking}} (SDN) offers {{greater flexibility}} than traditional distributed architectures, at the <b>risk</b> of the <b>controller</b> be-ing a single point-of-failure. Unfortunately, existing fault-tolerance techniques, such as replicated state machine, are insufficient to en-sure correct network behavior under controller failures. The chal-lenge is that, {{in addition to}} the application state of the controllers, the switches maintain hard state that must be handled consistently. Thus, it is necessary to incorporate switch state into the system model to correctly offer a “logically centralized ” controller. We introduce Ravana, a fault-tolerant SDN controller platform that processes the control messages transactionally and exactly once (at both the controllers and the switches). Ravana maintains these guarantees in the face of both controller and switch crashes. The key insight in Ravana is that replicated state machines can be ex-tended with lightweight switch-side mechanisms to guarantee cor-rectness, without involving the switches in an elaborate consensus protocol. Our prototype implementation of Ravana enables unmod-ified controller applications to execute in a fault-tolerant fashion. Experiments show that Ravana achieves high throughput with rea-sonable overhead, compared to a single controller, with a failover time under 100 ms. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the Controllership {{relevance}} as support risk management in non-financial companies. Risk management is a widely discussed and disseminated subject amongst financial institutions. It is obvious that economic uncertainties and, consequently, prevention and. control must also exist in non-financial companies. To enable managers to take safe-decisions, it is essential for them to be able to count on instrumental support that provides timely and adequate information, to ensure lower levels of mistakes and risk exposure. However, discussion concerning risk management in non-financial companies is still in its early stages in Brazil. Considering this gap, this study aims at assessing how Controllership has been acting in? companies under the insight of risk and how it can contribute to risk management in non-financial companies. To achieve the proposed goal, a field research was. carried-out with non-financial companies that are located in the city Sao Paulo and listed in the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa). The research was carried out using questionnaires, which were sent do <b>Risk</b> Officers and <b>Controllers</b> of those companies with the purpose of evaluating their perception on the subject. The results,of the research allow us to conclude that Controllership offers support to risk management, through information that contributes to the mitigation of the risks in non-financial companies...|$|R
40|$|Occupational {{health and}} safety is {{foremost}} regarded with traffic controllers than any other occupation in the construction industry. Traffic controllers are employed on road works to provide a safe working environment for road works to be carried out. The work of a traffic controller is to employ {{health and safety}} principles for a safe work site, {{in which there are}} standards and code of conducts that govern. However this dissertation will look at {{the health and safety of}} the traffic controller themselves. The standards and code of conducts relating to the health and safety of traffic controllers will be analysed, as well as industry data to determine high risk factors of traffic control work. On any traffic management site the main health and safety hazard to traffic controllers are drivers and their vehicles. Safety standards and code of conducts are set out to account for this main hazard. However varying driver behaviours at road work presents a varying risk. The overall aim of this dissertation is to determine what type of driver factors place traffic <b>controllers</b> at <b>risk</b> at road works. Understanding these factors/risks will allow possible new mitigation measures to be proposed to reduce the <b>risk</b> to traffic <b>controllers.</b> However in order for this to be carried out an understanding of risks, risk identification and risk management needs to be developed. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{identify}} threats to power substation controllers and SCADA systems, and discuss mitigating mechanisms to reduce vulnerability to malicious electronic intrusions. The U. S. National Institute of Standards and Technology lists nine threats to computer-related commerce in North America. Six of those threats are particularly pertinent to SCADA systems, {{and at least}} four are relevant to power substation controllers. Increasing reliance on automated control systems with remote access (via phone or internet) and the growing global economy have expanded the number of potential attackers with access to substation controllers and SCADA systems, and therefore magnified the risk electric utilities have from sabotage and espionage. It is estimated that industrial and foreign espionage in North America has increased over 260 % in the last decade, {{and it has been}} acknowledged by the U. S. government that other countries have nationally sponsored information warfare efforts targeted against North American commerce. The utilities industry needs to be aware of these threats to their systems and take steps to reduce risk and mitigate vulnerabilities. Protective relay developers and auxiliary service providers should use mechanisms that minimize the likelihood that persons with hostile intent can degrade or destroy commercial power systems. Product, project, and corporate-wide security policies are tools to identify vulnerabilities, assess risk, and implement mitigating mechanisms. Many of the <b>risks</b> involving networked <b>controllers</b> and SCADA systems are similar to those affecting traditional networked-based computer systems. Hence, implementations of security policies for substation controllers and SCADA systems can draw from lessons learned in commercial net [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. An active {{magnetic}} bearing (AMB) involves the suspension of a rotor by means of electromagnetic actuators. An AMB system comprises actuators, position sensors, a controller and power amplifiers. Conventional position sensors for rotor position sensing are expensive. The McTronX Research Group at the North-West University is currently conducting research on self-sensing, a method of extracting rotor position from the current and voltage actuation signals of the AMB. It was deemed necessary to develop a complete platform that will enable the implementation of self-sensing algorithms. The platform incorporates analogue circuitry, embedded devices and switching power amplifiers. The system will thus integrate all the electronics required for AMB suspension, and is thus dubbed: an Integrated Controller. The development of the integrated controller presented unique design challenges not yet faced by the McTronX group. To increase the chances of success and minimize some of the <b>risks,</b> the integrated <b>controller</b> was developed in collaboration with an industry partner. The collaboration required a systems engineering approach to the project. A detail type B specification was drawn up {{to aid in the}} project management process. The specification includes important detail such as the functional architectures, functional capabilities, performance specifications and physical constraints of the integrated controller. Some self-sensing algorithms can be implemented by means of analogue circuitry, and some can only be implemented in the digital domain. These digital algorithms are computationally intensive and require powerful processors. Digital signal processors (DSPs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) both exhibit unique architectures ideal for digital signal processing. Both these devices were implemented in the integrated controller, with the DSP as the main processor and the FPGA the co-processor. Although the integrated controller can operate as a stand-alone system, it has several communication interfaces (RS 485, USB and RS 232). This allows the system to work in conjunction with other integrated controllers, to be controlled by a master controller or to communicate to a personal computer (PC). Testing the integrated controller involved the closed loop current control of an AMB power amplifier, facilitating all critical functional aspects. The integrated controller's performance meets the required specifications and is expected to successfully facilitate future self-sensing investigations. Master...|$|R
40|$|A {{driving cycle}} is a {{representation}} of how vehicles are driven and  is usually represented {{by a set of}} data points of vehicle speed  versus time.   Driving cycles have been used to evaluate vehicles for  a long time. A traditional usage of driving cycles have been in  certification test procedures where the exhaust gas emissions from  the vehicles need to comply with legislation. Driving cycles are now  also used in product development for example to size components or  to evaluate different technologies.   Driving cycles can be just a  repetition of measured data, be synthetically designed from  engineering standpoints, be a statistically equivalent  transformation of either of the two previous, or be obtained as an  inverse problem e. g. obtaining driving/operation patterns.   New  methods that generate driving cycles and extract typical behavior  from large amounts of operational data have recently been proposed.   Other methods can be used for comparison of driving cycles, or to  get realistic operations from measured data.   This work addresses evaluation, transformation and extraction of  driving cycles and vehicle operations.   To be able to test a vehicle  in a controlled environment, a chassis dynamometer is an  option. When the vehicle is mounted, the chassis dynamometer  simulates the road forces that the vehicle would experience if it  would be driven on a real road. A moving base simulator is a  well-established technique to evaluate driver perception of e. g. the  powertrain in a vehicle, and by connecting these two simulators the  fidelity can be enhanced in the moving base simulator and at the  same time the mounted vehicle in the chassis dynamometer is  experiencing more realistic loads. This is due to the driver's  perception in the moving base simulator is close to reality.   If only a driving cycle is considered in the optimization of a  controller there is a <b>risk</b> that the <b>controllers</b> of vehicles are  tailored to perform well in that specific driving cycle and not  during real-world driving. To avoid the sub-optimization issues, the  operating regions of the engine need to be excited differently. This  can be attained by using a novel algorithm, which is proposed in  this thesis, that alters the driving cycle while maintaining that  the driving cycle tests vehicles in a similar way. This is achieved  by keeping the mean tractive force constant during the process.   From a manufacturers standpoint it is vital to understand how your  vehicles are being used by the customers. Knowledge about the usage  can be used for design of driving cycles, component sizing and  configuration, during the product development process, and in  control algorithms.   To get a clearer picture of the usage of wheel  loaders, a novel algorithm that automatically, using existing  sensors only, extracts information of the customers usage, is  suggested. The approach is found to be robust when evaluated on  measured data from wheel loaders loading gravel and shot rock...|$|R
