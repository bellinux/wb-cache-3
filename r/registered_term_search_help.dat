40|$|Collating the {{published}} research around institutional, long term care is confounded by the differing terminologies {{used to describe}} this health-care setting. We aimed to collate the descriptors used by researchers to inform the future development of a ‘search filter’ (a collection of <b>search</b> <b>terms</b> to <b>help</b> identify relevant records from electronic literature databases). We surveyed international researchers via the Nursing Home Research International Working Group, European Geriatric Medicine Society and published reviewers, achieving at 38 % response rate across 21 countries. Our findings identified variation in terminology used by researchers to describe long-term care settings in their country of practice. Nursing home was the most accepted term (96 %). ‘Homes for the Aged’ was selected by 48 % of respondents. A range of terms {{are likely to be}} necessary to identify all relevant research and these may not be intuitive. We will use these data to help inform development of a search filter...|$|R

40|$|User-defined {{metadata}} {{is useful}} for curating and helping to provide context for experiment records, but our previous investigations have demonstrated that simply providing the facility to add metadata {{is not enough to}} ensure that metadata is added, let alone to ensure that the metadata is of high quality. For metadata to be useful it first has to be present, but enforcing metadata generation is of no benefit if it is low quality, inconsistent, or irrelevant. Researchers need support. One strategy to encourage more effective metadata creation is to design user interfaces that invite users to add metadata by asking them questions. If we ask users specific questions about their experiments and other activities then we could capture more relevant or useful metadata, although there is a risk that asking the wrong questions may lead to loss of valuable metadata terms or the creation of irrelevant material. In this paper we report on a study to investigate how different questions could be used to generate metadata by eliciting information in three different conditions: free recall, changing perspective by thinking about <b>search</b> <b>terms</b> to <b>help</b> someone else, and providing cues by using a set of topic...|$|R
30|$|The Kaldi spoken term {{detection}} system [68 – 70] handles OOV <b>term</b> <b>search</b> {{by means of}} a method called proxy words [71]. This method essentially consists of substituting each OOV word of the <b>search</b> <b>term</b> with acoustically similar INV proxy words, getting rid of the need of a subword-based system for OOV <b>term</b> <b>search.</b> However, this method was not used within this system, causing those terms containing any OOV words not to be detected at all.|$|R

40|$|Clustering {{the results}} of a <b>search</b> <b>helps</b> the user to {{overview}} the information returned. In this paper, we regard the clustering task as indexing the search results. Here, an index means a structured label list that can makes it easier for the user to comprehend the labels and search results. To realize this goal, we make three proposals. First is to use Named Entity Extraction for term extraction. Second is a new label selecting criterion based on importance in the search result and the relation between <b>terms</b> and <b>search</b> queries. The third is label categorization using category information of labels, which is generated by NE extraction. We implement a prototype system based on these proposals and find that it offers much higher performance than existing methods; we focus on news articles in this paper...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} model of <b>search</b> <b>term</b> {{selection}} process based on our empirical study of professional searchers during the pre-online stage of the search process. The model characterizes the selection of <b>search</b> <b>terms</b> as the navigation of different discourses. Discourse refers to the way of talking and thinking about a certain topic; there often exists multiple, diverse discourses on the same topic. When selecting <b>search</b> <b>terms,</b> searchers appear to navigate a variety of discourses, i. e., they view the topic of a client's search request {{from the perspective of}} multiple discourse communities, and evaluate and synthesize differences and similarities among those discourses when selecting <b>search</b> <b>terms.</b> Six discourses emerged as sources of <b>search</b> <b>terms</b> in our study. These discourses are controlled vocabularies, documents and domains, the practice of indexing, clients' search requests, databases and the searchers' own search experience. Data further suggest that searchers navigate these discourses dynamically and have preferences for certain discourses. Conceptualizing the selection of <b>search</b> <b>terms</b> as a meeting place of different discourses provides new insights into the complex nature of the <b>search</b> <b>term</b> selection process. It emphasizes the multiplicity and complexity of the sources of <b>search</b> <b>terms,</b> the dynamic nature of the <b>search</b> <b>term</b> selection process, and the complex analysis and synthesis of differences and similarities among sources of <b>search</b> <b>terms.</b> It suggests that searchers may need to understand fundamental aspects of multiple discourses in order to select <b>search</b> <b>terms...</b>|$|R
