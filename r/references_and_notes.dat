Worked hard upon the blue book, and [...] <b>references</b> <b>and</b> <b>notes</b> for speech. House at 4-1/4.

40|$|We {{detected}} common genomic hallmarks in the powdery mildews {{associated with}} obligate biotrophy. These include gene losses and exten-sive gene reshuffling correlated with expansion in (retro-) transposon number and genome size. Together, these hallmarks {{may represent a}} tradeoff between advantages of increased genetic variation independent of sexual recombination and irreversi-ble deletion of genes dispensable for biotrophy. Hence, their evolution provides a notable example of Dollo’s law of evolutionary irreversibility (15). This may explain why powdery mildews and pos-sibly other biotrophic parasites became obligate. <b>References</b> <b>and</b> <b>Note...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Maryland Physics Expectations Survey (MPEX) {{describes}} {{student attitudes}} and expectations toward learning, {{and might be}} used to predict normalized gains on tests such as the Force and Motion Concept Evaluation (FMCE). These predictions are incomplete, though, due to limitations of the standardized tests themselves. I illustrate the problems involved in using the MPEX to predict productive attitudes toward learning physics by focusing on two students, both with seemingly appropriate expectations toward learning. While one had high normalized gains, the other did not, due to "false favorable" responses on the MPEX.

The latter two approaches provide an alternative avenue, if not crosscheck, to the usual mixing-decay interference study in modes such as B_s → J/ψϕ.
