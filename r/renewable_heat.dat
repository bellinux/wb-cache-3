25|$|In the future, {{industrial}} heat pumps will be further de-carbonised by using, on one side, excess renewable electrical energy (otherwise spilled due to meeting of grid demand) from wind, solar, etc. and, {{on the other}} side, by making more of <b>renewable</b> <b>heat</b> sources (lake and ocean heat, geothermal, etc.). Furthermore, higher efficiency can be expected through operation on the high voltage network.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to internal combustion engines, Stirling engines {{have the potential}} to use <b>renewable</b> <b>heat</b> sources more easily, to be quieter, and to be more reliable with lower maintenance. They are preferred for applications that value these unique advantages, particularly if the cost per unit energy generated {{is more important than the}} capital cost per unit power. On this basis, Stirling engines are cost competitive up to about 100kW.|$|E

40|$|Best {{practice}} policy {{design and}} harmonisation of support schemes for electricity from {{renewable energy sources}} (RES-E) within the European Union have been discussed controversially for years. In contrast, policies for improving <b>renewable</b> <b>heating</b> (RES-H) penetration in the European Member States and options for best practice instruments are still being developed. The objective {{of this paper is}} to analyse different levels of policy harmonisation for target compliance and the economics of <b>renewable</b> <b>heating</b> and cooling. After presenting the degree of RES-H policy harmonisation resulting from Directive 2009 / 28 /EC, a quantitative assessment is performed of the costs and benefits of different harmonisation scenarios. This selects the obligation to use <b>renewable</b> <b>heating</b> in buildings as the common policy instrument against which the effects of harmonisation are analysed. The paper shows that economic benefits can result from implementing best practice design options for use obligations in EU Member States...|$|R
25|$|Feed-In Tariffs are {{intended}} to incentivise small-scale (less than 5MW), low-carbon electricity generation. These feed-in tariffs work alongside the Renewables Obligation (RO), which will remain the primary mechanism to incentivise deployment of large-scale renewable electricity generation. The <b>Renewable</b> <b>Heat</b> Incentive (RHI) in intended to incentivise the generation of heat from renewable sources. They also currently offer up to 21p per kWh from December 2011 in the Tariff for photovoltaics plus another 3p for the Export Tariff - an overall figure which could see a household earning back double what they currently pay for their electricity.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the United Kingdom Government {{agreed to}} an overall European Union target of {{generating}} 20% of the European Union's energy supply from renewable sources by 2020. Each European Union member state was given its own allocated target; for the United Kingdom it is 15%. This was formalised in January 2009 {{with the passage of}} the EU Renewables Directive. As <b>renewable</b> <b>heat</b> and fuel production in the United Kingdom are at extremely low bases, RenewableUK estimates that this will require 35–40% of the United Kingdom's electricity to be generated from renewable sources by that date, to be met largely by 33–35 GW of installed wind capacity.|$|E

In contrast, the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 has been viewed as a positive step. To replace earlier schemes, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) launched the Low Carbon Buildings Programme in April 2006, which provided grants to individuals, communities and businesses wishing to invest in microgenerating technologies. These schemes have been replaced in turn by new proposals from the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) for clean energy cashback via Feed-In Tariffs [...] for generating electricity from April 2010 and the <b>Renewable</b> <b>Heat</b> Incentive [...] for generating <b>renewable</b> <b>heat</b> from 28 November 2011.|$|E

2500|$|In her {{capacity}} as Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in 2012, Foster oversaw {{the establishment of}} a green energy scheme, which led to the <b>Renewable</b> <b>Heat</b> Incentive scandal. [...] The scheme gave a perverse incentive to use more energy and increase their carbon footprint to those who signed up to it since they could claim £1.60 for every £1 spent on heating with, for example, wood pellets. [...] With no cost controls, it could cost the public purse up to £490 million.|$|E
2500|$|Solar {{water heating}} makes an {{important}} contribution to <b>renewable</b> <b>heat</b> in many countries, most notably in China, which now has 70% of the global total (180 GWth). Most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 50–60 million households in China. Worldwide, total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households. The use of biomass for heating continues to grow as well. In Sweden, national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil. Direct geothermal for heating is also growing rapidly. [...] The newest addition to Heating is from Geothermal Heat Pumps which provide both heating and cooling, and also flatten the electric demand curve and are thus an increasing national priority (see also Renewable thermal energy).|$|E

40|$|In {{the light}} of the EU {{directive}} for renewable energy (2009 / 28 /EC) this paper deals with the question how various policy instruments could impact the development of <b>renewable</b> <b>heating</b> technologies. The paper applies the simulation model Invert/EE-Lab for the building related heat demand in selected European countries (Austria, Lithuania and United Kingdom). The resulting scenarios up to 2030 are compared to RES-Heat targets from literature, stakeholder consultation processes and the targets in the national renewable energy action plans submitted by EU Member States in 2010. The results demonstrate that use obligations for <b>renewable</b> <b>heating</b> can be effective in achieving RES-Heat market growth. However, in order to attain a balanced technology mix and more ambitious targets, policy packages are required combining use obligations with economic incentives and accompanying measures. Technology specific conclusions are derived. Moreover, conclusions indicate that the action plans are not always consistent with policy measures in place or under discussion...|$|R
