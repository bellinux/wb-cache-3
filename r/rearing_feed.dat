Dehydrated food waste was the main energy source, superworms and unfertilized eggs were the main protein sources. Six experimental diets were formulated to have 3 energy to protein ratios (134, 150 and 164) with 150 energy to protein ratio as the control [...] Every ratio had two different protein sources with the same inclusion level. Each treatment had 2 replicates with 12 birds each in a complete randomized design. Feed and water were provided ad libitum from 0 - 42 d. Proximate analysis of the main ingredients in the diet showed dehydrated food waste had 4, 500. 54 kcal/kg of gross energy and 25. 18 % of crude protein while superworms and unfertilized eggs had crude protein of 46. 54 and 46. 33 %, respectively. The study showed that a single diet of energy:protein ratio of 134 kcal ME/kg protein supported optimum growth rate of Arabian strain village chicken from 1 to 42 d of <b>rearing.</b> <b>Feed</b> conversion ratio improved with increasing dietary energy level.

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{experiment}} with Nicholas parent-stock turkey breeder hens {{was designed to}} determine the effects of feed restnction during the rearing period and age at photostimulation on reproductive performance. Hens reared on ad libitum intake of conventional corn-soybean diets (ad libitum), skip- 1 -day per week (skip- 1 -day), and 95 % of ad libitum (95 %) were placed into cages and photostimulated when they reached a target body weight of 10 kg or at the conventional age of 29 wk. A 3 x 2 factorial design was used, with five replicates of three hens for each treatment. All birds were fed for ad libitum access during the breeding period. More eggs were set from 95 % birds than from ad libitum or skip- 1 -day birds (P< 05); there was no difference between ad libitum and skip- 1 -day birds. Photostimnlafing based on 10 kg of BW versus 29 wk of age had no effect on total eggs set. There was no effect of <b>rearing</b> <b>feed</b> restriction on fertility or hatchability. Photostimulating based on 10 kg rather than 29 wk of age reduced fertility and hatchability (P< 05). The results of this study indicate that optimum reproductive performance is attained by restricting the feed consumption of turkey breeder hens to 95 % of ad libitum during the rearing period. No benefits were gained from photostimulating at 10 kg of BW versus 29 wk of age. (Key words: feed restriction, photostimulation, age, reproduction, turkey breeder hens...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Broiler breeder pullets were {{subjected}} to photostimulation (PS) at either 14, 17, or 20 wk of age after attaining greater than recommended BW during rearing {{in order to determine}} effects on age at onset of lay, egg weight, and egg production. During <b>rearing,</b> <b>feed</b> was consumed ad libitum (AL) or provided in allotments resulting in growth to projected BW of 2. 8 (heavy, HV) or 2. 3 kg (light, LT) at 20 wk. Rearing period feeding and age at PS treatments made up a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement. A single restricted feeding program was provided during lay. Although age at first egg in the AL treatment was earlier than in HV and LT treatments, total production by HV and LT birds was greater because peak and postpeak production by AL birds were depressed. Relative to PS at 20 wk, PS at 14 and 17 wk advanced age at first egg and increased cumulative production to 30 wk. However, early PS decreased peak production and, therefore, did not affect total production. Mean egg weight and settable egg production (egg weight> 50 g) were increased in HV and LT treatments. Egg weight and settable egg production were not affected by age at PS. These results indicate that the onset of lay by broiler breeders can be advanced by early PS and that increased BW facilitates this. However, allowing greater BW during rearing does not compensate for reduced early egg weights and results in decreased total production and mean egg weights when feed is provided at recommended levels during lay.

40|$|Many {{studies show}} the {{involvement}} of the serotonergic (5 -HT) system in the performance of abnormal behaviour in both human and animals. Recently, we showed that acute reduction of 5 -HT turnover in the forebrain, increased gentle and severe feather pecking behaviour in chicks from a high (HFP) and low feather pecking (LFP) line of laying hens, suggesting that the performance of feather pecking behaviour involves low 5 -HT neurotransmission. In the present study, we postulated that if low 5 -HT is causally underlying feather pecking, increasing 5 -HT turnover in the forebrain will decrease the development and performance of feather pecking. Augmentation of 5 -HT neurotransmission in the brain was induced by chronically increasing dietary levels of the essential amino acid L-tryptophan (TRP) from which 5 -HT is synthesised. From the age of 34 days, LFP and HFP chicks were fed a diet containing 2 % TRP, whereas control birds of both lines were continuously fed with the normal <b>rearing</b> <b>feed</b> (0. 16 % TRP). From 35 days of age, litter was removed from the pens (10 pens/line-treatment) and all chicks (10 chicks/pen) were housed on a slatted floor {{until the end of the}} experiment. At 49 days of age, feather pecking behaviour was studied for 30 min. At 50 days of age baseline corticosterone, TRP and other large amino acids (LNAAs) were measured in the blood plasma of decapitated chicks (10 chicks per line-treatment). Furthermore, plasma corticosterone and central 5 -HT turnover levels in response to manual restraint (5 min) were determined (10 chicks/line-treatment). For neither gentle nor severe feather pecking a significant line × treatment interaction was found. However, TRP treatment resulted in a significant [P = 0. 02] overall decrease of the frequency of gentle feather pecking. For severe feather pecking a similar but not significant pattern was found. Significant line effects were found for gentle and severe feather pecking. HFP birds showed significantly higher levels of gentle and severe feather pecking behaviour than LFP birds [P < 0. 001]. TRP treatment significantly increased the TRP/LNAA ratio in the plasma of the chicks. Furthermore, TRP treatment overall increased baseline and stress-induced levels of plasma corticosterone (although more pronounced in the LFP line). TRP supplementation significantly increased 5 -HT turnover in the hippocampus and archistriatum and tended to do so in the remainder of the forebrain. The results confirm our hypothesis that feather pecking behaviour is triggered by low serotonergic neurotransmission, as increasing serotonergic tone, by increasing dietaryTRP, decreases gentle feather pecking behaviour. ...|$|E

40|$|Lifetime {{production}} records of 122, 679 cows and production data of 691, 383 lactations obtained from MidStates Dairy Records Processing Center, Ames, lowa, {{were used to}} estimate relative economic values for production to herd life and production to somatic cell score. ^ Using lifetime production data, relative net income and relative net income for the planning horizon were calculated as income minus costs. Planning horizon of five lactations was chosen and cows culled before fifth lactation were credited with profit from replacements to obtain relative net income for the planning horizon. Income was from sale of milk, calves and cull cows. Costs were for heifer <b>rearing,</b> <b>feed,</b> labor and breeding. Profits were regressed on milk, fat and protein yields, and herd life. Regression coefficients were multiplied by unadjusted phenotypic standard deviations of traits to obtain relative economic values. Relative economic value for production to herd life was. 18 : 1 for relative net income, and. 46 : 1 for relative net income for planning horizon. Value of herd life was overestimated by about 2. 5 times when profit from replacements was ignored. Heritability of herd life estimated using animal and sire models of. 50 was used to obtain predicted transmitting abilities for herd life. As the estimated heritability was higher than most estimates from literature, predicted transmitting abilities for herd life were calculated for different values of heritability (. 05,. 10,. 20,. 50). Profits were regressed on predicted transmitting abilities for milk, fat and protein yields, and herd life. Relative economic values obtained from regression coefficients {{and standard deviations of}} predicted transmitting abilities, were similar to relative economic values obtained when profits were regressed on phenotypic measures. For profit regressed on predicted transmitting abilities, relative economic values did not differ much with change in assumed heritability of herd life. ^ Relative net income per lactation was obtained for 691, 383 lactations as income minus costs, to estimate relative economic value of production to somatic cell score. Income was from milk, fat and protein yields, and premium for somatic cell count. Costs were from breeding, feed and labor requirements. Relative net income per lactation was regressed on production yields and somatic cell score. Regression coefficients were multiplied by unadjusted phenotypic standard deviations of traits to obtain relative economic value for production to somatic cell score, which was 1 :$-$. 21. Large negative value for somatic cell score was mostly due to premiums paid for somatic cell count because, relative values were 1 :$-$. 015 when premiums for somatic cell count were not used in calculating income. ...|$|E
