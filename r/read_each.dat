Tandy <b>read</b> <b>each</b> text before he began sketching, so his early covers were closely connected to specific scenes in the plots. He also hand-painted the cover lettering and designed the original Nancy Drew logo: a silhouette of Nancy bending slightly and looking at the ground through a quizzing glass.|$|E

Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Yu Suzuki, who used this technique with Space Harrier. The development team <b>read</b> <b>each</b> issue of Famitsu to stay informed of what their rivals were doing so they can avoid making the same mistakes.|$|E

25|$|Human scoring is {{relatively}} expensive and often variable, {{which is why}} computer scoring is preferred when feasible. For example, some critics say that poorly paid employees will score tests badly. Agreement between scorers can vary between 60 and 85 percent, depending on the test and the scoring session. Sometimes states pay to have two or more scorers <b>read</b> <b>each</b> paper; if their scores do not agree, then the paper is passed to additional scorers.|$|E
25|$|In November 1972, Yanni {{moved from}} Greece to the United States {{to attend the}} University of Minnesota {{beginning}} in January 1973, majoring in psychology. For a time he earned money by washing dishes at the student union. Yanni later explained that learning English forced him to <b>read</b> <b>each</b> paragraph several times in {{what he called a}} slow and frustrating process, but which helped him memorize the material and do well on tests. He received a B.A. degree in psychology in 1976.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{adding more}} memory {{can help to}} make a program run faster. For example, a {{filtering}} program will commonly <b>read</b> <b>each</b> line and filter and output that line immediately. This only uses enough memory for one line, but performance is typically poor, due to the latency of each disk read. Performance can be greatly improved by reading the entire file then writing the filtered result, though this uses much more memory. Caching the result is similarly effective, though also requiring larger memory use.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, some Conservative (as {{evidenced}} in the Etz Hayim chumash) and most Reform, Reconstructionist and Renewal congregations have {{switched to a}} triennial cycle, where the first third of each parashah is read one year, the second third {{the next year and}} the final third in a third year. This must be distinguished from the ancient practice, which was to <b>read</b> <b>each</b> seder in serial order regardless of the week of the year, completing the entire Torah in three (or three and a half) years in a linear fashion.|$|E
25|$|While the H11 {{was popular}} with hard-core hobbyists, Heath {{engineers}} realized that DEC's PDP microprocessors {{would not be}} able to get Heath up the road to more powerful systems. Heath/Zenith then designed a dual Intel 8085/8088 based system dubbed the H100 (or Z-100, in preassembled form, sold by ZDS). The machine featured very advanced (for the day) bit mapped video that allowed up to 640 x 512 pixels of 8 color graphics. The H100 was interesting in that it could run either the CP/M operating system, or their OEM version of MS-DOS named Z-DOS, which were the two leading business PC operating systems at the time. Although the machine had to be rebooted to change modes, they could <b>read</b> <b>each</b> other's disks.|$|E

Nuada critically wounds Hellboy with his spear and abducts Nuala, promising her return {{in exchange for the}} crown piece. Unable to remove the spear shard in his wound, Liz, Abe and Krauss take Hellboy to the Golden Army's location in the Giants Causeway in Northern Ireland. They encounter a Bethmoora goblin who brings them before the Angel of Death. Though warned Hellboy will doom humanity if he lives, and that she will suffer the most from it, Liz pleads for Hellboy's life. The Angel removes the shard from Hellboy's chest and tells Liz to give him a reason to live. She reveals to Hellboy that he will be a father, and he recovers.|$|E

The next verse is then recited in that order, {{until the end of}} the portion. Other authorities (e.g. the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 72:11) recommend dividing the text into its closed and open paragraphs as set out in a Torah scroll and in most printed copies, <b>reading</b> <b>each</b> paragraph as a whole, first twice in Hebrew and then once in Targum.

500|$|Scott Leva {{was still}} {{associated}} with the character through Marvel (he had appeared in photo covers of the comic), and <b>read</b> <b>each</b> draft. Leva commented, [...] "Ted Newsom and John Brancato had written the script. It was good but it needed a little work. Unfortunately, with every subsequent rewrite by other writers, it went from good to bad to terrible." [...] Due to Cannon's assorted financial crises, the project shut down after spending about $1.5million on the project. In 1989, Pathé, owned by corrupt Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, acquired the overextended Cannon. The filmmaking cousins parted, Globus remaining associated with Pathé, Golan leaving to run 21st Century Film Corporation, keeping a number of properties (including Spider-Man) {{in lieu of a}} cash buy-out.

Grammer usually joins the show's [...] "table readings" [...] (wherein cast members <b>read</b> <b>each</b> script {{together for the}} first time), and former executive producer David Mirkin described working with Grammer as very pleasant, due to his lively sense of humor. Grammer, Mirkin says, is capable of perfect readings, but noted that the actor dislikes performing Sideshow Bob's evil laugh. In a 2007 interview, Simpsons executive producer Al Jean listed Grammer as one of his favorite guest stars (second only to Phil Hartman), saying [...] "his voice is so rich."

Subsequently, they talked [...] "to the directors and writers of the other Phase 3 movies on an almost weekly basis, {{to make sure everything}} lines up right." [...] Similarly, when developing the crossover miniseries The Defenders, showrunner Marco Ramirez consulted with the creators of all the individual Marvel Netflix series, having them <b>read</b> <b>each</b> of the scripts for The Defenders and provide insight into the individual character's world. In April 2017, along with his announcement that he was returning to write and direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, James Gunn revealed he would be working with Marvel [...] "to help design where these stories go, and make sure the future of the Marvel Cosmic Universe is as special and authentic and magical as what we have created so far." ...|$|E

500|$|Steven Spielberg, {{a fan of}} {{the comics}} and toys, signed on as {{executive}} producer in 2004. John Rogers wrote the first draft, which pitted four Autobots against four Decepticons, and featured the Ark spaceship. Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, fans of the cartoon, were hired to rewrite the script in February 2005. Spielberg suggested that [...] "a boy and his car" [...] should be the focus. This appealed to Orci and Kurtzman because it conveyed themes of adulthood and responsibility, [...] "the things that a car represents in the United States". The characters of Sam and Mikaela were the sole point of view given in Orci and Kurtzman's first draft. The Transformers had no dialogue, as the producers feared talking robots would look ridiculous. The writers felt that even if it would look silly, not having the robots speak would betray the fanbase. The first draft also had a battle scene in the Grand Canyon. Spielberg <b>read</b> <b>each</b> of Orci and Kurtzman's drafts and gave notes for improvement. The writers remained involved throughout production, adding additional dialogue for the robots during the sound mixing (although none of this was kept in the final film, which ran fifteen minutes shorter than the initial edit). Furman's The Ultimate Guide, published by Dorling Kindersley, remained as a resource to the writers throughout production. Prime Directive was used as a fake working title. This was also the name of Dreamwave Productions' first [...]|$|E
500|$|In his {{foreword}} of the novel, John Galsworthy {{called it}} a [...] "delicious book" [...] and a [...] "little masterpiece" [...] that shows a [...] "delicacy of perception and essential truth". He notes that while reading the galley proof of the novel while crossing the English Channel, he, his wife, and his nephew <b>read</b> <b>each</b> page in turn {{over the course of}} three hours in [...] "silent absorption." [...] The New York Times reviewer John Chamberlain praised Salten's [...] "tender, lucid style" [...] that [...] "takes you out of yourself". He felt that Salten captured the essence of each of the creatures as they talked, catching the [...] "rhythm of the different beings who people his forest world" [...] and showed particular [...] "comprehension" [...] in detailing the various stages of Bambi's life. He also considered the English translation [...] "admirably" [...] done. A reviewer for Catholic World praised the approach of the subject, noting that it was [...] "marked by poetry and sympathy [...] charming reminders of German folklore and fairy tale". However, they disliked the [...] "transference of certain human ideals to the animal mind" [...] and the vague references to religious allegory. The Boston Transcript {{called it a}} [...] "sensitive allegory of life". The Saturday Review considered it [...] "beautiful and graceful" [...] piece that showed a rare [...] "individuality". The Times Literary Supplement stated that the novel is a [...] "tale of exceptional charm, though untrustworthy of some of the facts of animal life." [...] Isabel Ely Lord, reviewing the novel for the American Journal of Nursing, called the novel a [...] "delightful animal story" [...] and Salten a [...] "poet" [...] whose [...] "picture of the woods and its people is an unforgettable one." [...] In comparing Bambi to Salten's later work Perri—in which Bambi makes a brief cameo—Louise Long of the Dallas Morning News considered both to be stories that [...] "quietly and completely [...] the heart". Long felt the prose was [...] "poised and mobile and beautiful as poetry" [...] and praises Salten for his ability to give the animals seemingly human speech while not [...] " [...] their essential natures." ...|$|E

However, recent studies of de Beauvoir's work focus on influences other than Sartre, including Hegel and Leibniz.
