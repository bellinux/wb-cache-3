40|$|ABSTRACT: High-resolution gravity cores and box cores {{from the}} North Icelandic shelf {{have been studied}} for palaeoceanographic history based on lithological and biostratigraphical foramin-iferal data. Results from two outer shelf cores {{covering}} the last 13. 6 k 14 C yr BP are presented in this paper. The sediments accumulated in north–south trending basins {{on each side of}} the Kolbeinsey Ridge at water depths of ca. 400 m. Sedimentation rates up to 1. 5 m kyr- 1 are observed during the Late-glacial and Holocene. The Vedde and Saksunarvatn tephras are present in the cores as well as the Hekla 1104. A new tephra, KOL-GS- 2, has been identified and dated to 13. 4 k 14 C yr BP, and another tephra, geochemically identical to the Borrobol Tephra, has been found at the same level. At present, the oceanographic Polar Front is located on the North Icelandic shelf, which experiences sharp oceanographic surface boundaries between the cold East Icelandic Current and the warmer Irminger Current. Past changes in sedimentological and biological processes in the study area are assumed to be related to fluctuations of the Polar Front. The area was deglaciated before ca. 14 kyr BP, but there is evidence of ice <b>rafting</b> <b>up</b> to the end of the GS- 1 (Greenland Stadial 1, Younger Dryas) period, increasing again towards the end of the Holocene. Foraminiferal studies show a relatively strong GS- 2 (pre- 13 kyr BP) palaeo-Irminger Current, followed by severe cooling and then by unstable conditions during th...|$|E
40|$|Thesis, (M. S.) Geological Sciences. Plate 6; Geology of the McGinty Mountain mafic complex, with {{scale of}} 1 : 7, 200. Plate 7; Cross-section of McGinty Mountain mafic complex, in back pocket. A mafic complex forms the north peak and the {{southern}} ridge of McGinty Mountain which is located approximately 0. 8 mile north of Jamul, San Diego County, California. The mafic rocks are in contact to the west with an unnamed xenolithic granodiorite and to the east with a unit of Woodson Mountain granodiorite which forms the southeastern ridge and a second peak of McGinty Mountain. A major fault trends along Beaver Hollow valley which is located northeast of McGinty Mountain and forms the eastern contact between Woodson Mountain granodiorite and a unit of Green Valley tonalite which underlies {{the floor of the}} valley. Two faults cut the gabbroic rocks, the northern fault separating a small northern protrusion from {{the main part of the}} gabbroic body and the other fault cutting across the mafic complex between the wide northern portion of the body and the narrow southern extension. Small gabbroic bodies are isolated to the east of the main mafic complex. Both the eastern and the western contacts of the main body dip under this body at angles varying from 22 ?? to 81 ?? and may converge inward at relatively shallow depths. The ultramafic rocks which grade from hypersthene-olivine peridotites to calcic plagioclase-olivine troctolites form a distinct zone of initial crystal settling within the gabbroic body. The mafic rocks consist predominantly of calcic plagioclase, diopsidic augite and olivine. Depending on the proportion of each constituent, the rock types range from anorthosites and gabbroic anorthosites to anorthositic gabbros, olivine gabbros and gabbros. Typically the contacts between rock types are intricate and gradational. Hornblende gabbro was found in a single locality where contacts between mafic rock types are sharp. In addition to the less calcic plagioclase and green hornblende, diopsidic augite is present as relic cores. Pegmatite and aplite dikes cut all batholithic units in the area. The gabbroic rocks are diked by Woodson Mountain granodiorite; whereas, the lamprophyre dikes, mafic pegmatite dikes and common banding structures in the gabbroic bodies are terminated at contacts. Small, isolated bodies of gabbro in the Woodson Mountain unit, gabbro adjacent to the contact with xenolithic granodiorite, and inclusions in the xenolithic unit may have been partially assimilated during emplacement of granitic plutons. Post-emplacement addition of fluids from the Woodson Mountain magmas extensively altered the pyroxene in the gabbros along portions of their contacts. Observed petrographic and structural features are compatible with emplacement of batholithic units from a combination of processes: (1) the introduction of a H 2 O- and CaAl-rich leucogabbroic magma into the lower crust, individual gabbroic plutons probably originating from a single mantle derivative but not intruding simultaneously; (2) partial melting, assimilation and anatexis of pelitic country rock to form quartz monzonitic magmas; (3) mixing of heated granitic magmas with both partially crystallized and solid gabbros to form hybrid batholithic rocks with intermediate compositions; and (4) diapiric movement of quartz-monzonitic and hybrid magmas, <b>rafting</b> <b>up</b> solidified gabbroic bodies to an ultimate emplacement higher in the crust...|$|E

The river can also be run by experienced rafters. For rafters, the run can be arduous, with log jams inevitably requiring portages, lining rafts down rapids, or simply heaving <b>rafts</b> <b>up</b> and over the blockage. For the well-seasoned and adventurous, however, this river provides a spectacular journey filled with class III and IV rapids before the Jarbidge runs into the Bruneau River. Rafters and kayakers should be aware that towards the end of this run (approximately 25 miles below Murphy Hot Springs), looms Jarbidge Falls. Jarbidge Falls is a class V+ run and should only be run by expert kayakers. A huge, row home-sized boulder blocking half the river signals the beginning of this rapid.|$|R
