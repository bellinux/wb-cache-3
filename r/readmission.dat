40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} {{factors related to}} avoidability of 30 -day <b>readmissions</b> at our public, safety net hospital in the United States (US). Methods: We prospectively reviewed medical records of adult internal medicine patients with scheduled and unscheduled 30 -day <b>readmissions.</b> We also interviewed patients if they were available. An independent panel used pre-specified, objective criteria to adjudicate potential avoidability. Results: Of 153 <b>readmissions</b> evaluated, 68 % were unscheduled. Among these, 67 % were unavoidable, primarily due to disease progression and development of new diagnoses. Scheduled <b>readmissions</b> accounted for 32 % of <b>readmissions</b> and most (69 %) were clinically appropriate and unavoidable. The scheduled but avoidable <b>readmissions</b> (31 %) were attributed largely to limited resources in our healthcare system. Conclusions: Most <b>readmissions</b> at our public, safety net hospital were unavoidable, even among our unscheduled <b>readmissions.</b> Surprisingly, one-third of our overall <b>readmissions</b> were scheduled, the majority reflecting appropriate management strategies designed to reduce unnecessary hospital days. The scheduled but avoidable <b>readmissions</b> were due to constrained access to non-emergent, expensive procedures that are typically not reimbursed given our system’s payo...|$|R

The early hospital <b>readmissions</b> within the first 30  d were numbered and the diagnosis ascertained. Patients were grouped as none, once, and twice or more <b>readmissions.</b> Predictors of early <b>readmissions</b> were assessed, and clinical outcomes and patient and death‐censored kidney survival were compared. Among 1064 patients, 203 (19. 1 %) patients had once and 83 (7. 8 %) patients had twice or more <b>readmissions</b> within 30  d. Surgical complications, infections, and acute kidney injuries/acute rejection were three most common diagnoses. The length of initial hospital stay and African American race were among the variables associated significantly with <b>readmissions.</b> Patients with early <b>readmissions</b> had lower baseline renal function (p <  0. 01) and more early acute rejection (p <  0. 01). During follow‐up, only frequent <b>readmissions,</b> twice or more, within 30  d were associated with increased risk of death (AHR 1. 75, p   =   0. 01) and death‐censored kidney failure (AHR 2. 20, p <  0. 01).

40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityIncreased {{scrutiny}} {{over the}} spiraling costs {{of health care}} and inefficiencies within the health care system has focused attention on <b>readmissions</b> to acute care that occurs within 30 -days of discharge. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have identified these early <b>readmissions</b> as an indicator of poor quality care. With one-fifth of Medicare beneficiaries who will experience early <b>readmissions,</b> it is imperative that a patient centered approach be implemented that will decrease functional dependence and increase quality of life in this vulnerable population (“The Partnership for Patients,” 2012; Toscan, Mairs, Hinton, & Stolee, 2012). Unplanned and often unnecessary <b>readmissions</b> affect 2. 6 million seniors per year at a cost of more than $ 26 billion (Axon & Williams, 2011; Bhalla & Kalkut, 2010; D’Amore, Murry, Powers, & Johnson, 2011; Hasan et al., 2009; Horwitz et al., 2011). Research by Anderson, Helms, Hanson, & DeVilder (1999) found that a breakdown in communication during the transition process was the most common factor in the occurrence of early <b>readmissions</b> and a significant source of poor patient outcomes (Steffens et al., 2009). A reduction in <b>readmissions</b> can be achieved through improved discharge planning, an improved process of communication between providers and through a nurse-driven program designed to transition patients more effectively...|$|R

40|$|The Hospital <b>Readmissions</b> Reduction Program (HRRP), {{a part of}} the U. S.

We calibrate our model with a data set of more than 3, 000 hospitals in the United States and show that under the current policy, and for a large set of parameters, 4 %– 13 % of the hospitals remain nonincentivized to reduce <b>readmissions.</b> We also validate our model against the actual performance of hospitals in the three years since the introduction of the policy. We draw several policy recommendations to improve this policy’s outcome.

40|$|Background: In {{the current}} policy {{environment}} hospital <b>readmissions</b> are receiving considerable attention {{due to a}} provision in the Affordable Care Act (2010), that penalize hospitals through reduced payments for excess <b>readmissions</b> (the hospital <b>readmissions</b> reduction program (HRRP)). This program primarily holds hospitals accountable, although a multitude of factors not directly in control of hospitals can be contributory to <b>readmissions.</b> Of these, whether or not patients are discharged to an appropriate post-discharge care setting can be one contributory factor, and, this study evaluated the association between post-discharge care setting and hospital revisits. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the 2008 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) was conducted. Three post-discharge care settings were evaluated: 1) routine discharge to home; 2) home with home healthcare; and 3) skilled nursing facility. Two outcomes were assessed: 1) 30 -day all-cause hospital readmissions; and 2) 30 -day all-cause hospital revisits (combination of inpatient admissions and emergency department visits). Analyses were carried out among patients with hospitalizations for any reason, as well as among a subgroup that were hospitalized for one of seven priority conditions identified in the HRRP. Weighted logistic regression analyses that incorporated information on the complex survey design were conducted. Results: Of the MCBS sample representing 46, 048, 125 Medicare beneficiaries (unweighted N= 11, 723), 4. 9 percent (N= 2, 293, 629; unweighted N= 670) contributed at least one index hospitalization to the analysis. Among hospitalization for any reason, 30 -day all-cause hospital <b>readmissions</b> and revisits was 12. 3 percent and 17. 8 percent, respectively. The subgroup consisted of 31. 8 percent of hospitalizations for any reason (N= 730, 174; unweighted N= 216). <b>Readmissions</b> and revisits in the subgroup were 17. 8 percent, and 24. 5 percent, respectively. Post-discharge care setting was not significantly associated with either <b>readmissions</b> (P= 0. 966) or revisits (P= 0. 728) for hospitalizations for any reason. Findings for the subgroup were similar with no significant association between post-discharge care setting with either <b>readmissions</b> (P= 0. 850) or revisits (P= 0. 483). Conclusion: Absence of a difference in <b>readmissions</b> and revisits by post-discharge care setting suggests that the choice of discharge status might be appropriate following an inpatient admission.
