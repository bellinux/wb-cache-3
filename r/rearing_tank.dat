50|$|Corydoras kanei {{is a small}} {{species of}} catfish from the family Callyichthydae endemic to Brazil where it {{is found in the}} Negros River basin. It is {{externally}} similar to Corydoras atropersonatus, but its spots are denser and unlike the former, it has caudal markings - markings on its tail fins. Breeding can be accomplished by feeding a mixture of live foods and catfish pellets, after which frequent cold water changes can trigger them to spawn. A gravid female will lay around 60 eggs; heavy oxygenation of the water is likely to be more efficacious at saving fry than using methylene blue. Fry grow slowly and reach around 2 cm after 8 months. It is not recommended to add different fish into the fry <b>rearing</b> <b>tank.</b> They do not mind lower temperatures and can be kept with species of fish that are endemic to low-temperature habitats, such as Sewellia lineolata.|$|E

Therefore, a new aerating method was tested {{in an actual}} scale intensive <b>rearing</b> <b>tank</b> (8. 0 m in diameter, 1. 87 m of water depth, 100 m 3 of volume), in which an aerator was positioned {{at the center of}} the <b>rearing</b> <b>tank</b> surrounding cylindrical drain (1. 2 m in diameter) to generate the flow field, and seven larval rearing trials were performed.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{apparatus}} for germ-free rearing of animals, the author studied on the methods of germ-free rearing historically and experimentally {{under the direction of}} Professor K. Tanikawa and Associate Professor J. Tanami. In our laboratory, a new compact type of rearing unit HMC- 1 was constructed after Reyniers 2 ̆ 7 system and Gustafsson 2 ̆ 7 s apparatus in 1954. Continuously the rearing unit HMC- 2 was constructed with the useful advice given by Professor M. Miyakawa. A thermo-sterilizing plant and glass-wool filter are used for air sterilization. In order to eliminate humidity in the air a fin-coil type refrigerating desicator is used. The ventilation power of pump on the average is 60 1 per minute, and this quantity of air is sufficient for 2 rearing tanks and 1 operating tank. The <b>rearing</b> <b>tank</b> is constructed of steel 6 mm in thickness, the diameter of the tank is 60 cm and the length is 120 cm. Entire surface of the tank is covered with asbestos in 3 cm thickness. This tank has 4 glove ports and 2 viewing ports, gloves are made of artificial rubber and are fixed on the glove ports of the tank with a special ring. The operating tank is almost equal to the <b>rearing</b> <b>tank</b> in its size and shape. This tank has a chamber for the operating trap provided under it. This trap is used for moving an animal into the tank. The sterilizing food clave is a small steel tank, 25 cm in diameter and 65 cm in length. This is used for removing food, water and the other heat steriliable articles into the <b>rearing</b> <b>tank.</b> The germicidal trap is an apparatus through which all objects placed into the <b>rearing</b> <b>tank,</b> which must not be sterilized with heat, must pass. The double Seitz-filter is an apparatus through which certain kinds of solution can be filtered and sterilized. The entire system can be sterilized at the same time, but in accordance with the demands of the experiment procedures, one part of the system, either the <b>rearing</b> <b>tank</b> or the operating tank, must be separately sterilized. Because of this reason a sterilizing pipe system is constructed for that purpose. The air temperature of the <b>rearing</b> <b>tank</b> is controlled by the air temperature regulator and the hot water tank provided under part of the tank, so there must be two electric regulating system for the <b>rearing</b> <b>tank.</b> All sorts of furnishings in the rearing tanks must be provided so as not to injure the,rubber gloves during manipulation. The HMC- 2 system is arranged to form a compact unit, so the system as a whole can be set in a chamber 3. 6 m× 7. 2 m and can be used coveniently. It will be important to devise a compact system or simplified unit for germ-free rearing of animals so as to make rearing easy to perform in every laboratory wanting to do some experiments with germ-free animal. In the near future, a central system for germ-free animal production will be established in our country. At that time a simplified and compact system of germ-free rearing unit, such as the HMC- 2, will become popular and convenient...|$|E
40|$|Variations in {{the growth}} and {{survival}} of six families of juvenile (initial mean weight = 4. 16 g) Penaeus japonicus were examined at two densities (48 and 144 individuals m(- 2)) in a controlled laboratory experiment. Survival was very high throughout the experiment (95. 4 %), but differed significantly between densities and rearing tanks. Family, sex and family x density interaction did not significantly affect survival. Mean specific growth rate (SGR) of the shrimp was 18 % faster at the low density (1. 93 +/- 0. 05 % day(- 1)) than at high density (1. 64 +/- 0. 03 % day(- 1)). However, {{there was a small}} but significant interaction between family and density indicating that growth of the families was not consistent at both densities. The inconsistent growth of the families across the two densities resulted in a change in the relative performance (ranking) of families at each density. Sex, <b>rearing</b> <b>tank</b> and rearing cage also affected growth of the shrimp. Mean SGR of the females (1. 79 +/- 0. 03 % day(- 1)) was 5 % faster than males (1. 70 +/- 0. 03 % day(- 1)) when averaged across both densities. Shrimp grew significantly faster in <b>rearing</b> <b>tank</b> 3 than <b>rearing</b> <b>tank</b> 1 or 2 at both densities. Results of the present study suggest that family x density interaction could affect the efficiency of selection for growth if shrimp stocks produced from shrimp breeding programs are to be grown across a wide range of densities.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} H 2 S on the bacterial consortia on the galatheid crab, Shinkaia crosnieri, crabs of this species were cultivated in the laboratory under two different conditions, with and without hydrogen sulfide feeding. We developed a novel <b>rearing</b> <b>tank</b> system equipped with a feedback controller using a semiconductor sensor for hydrogen sulfide feeding. H 2 S aqueous concentration was successfully maintained between 5 to 40 µM for 80 d {{with the exception of}} brief periods of mechanical issues. According to real-time PCR analysis, the numbers of copies of partial 16 S rRNA gene of an episymbiont of the crabs with H 2 S feeding was three orders of magnitude larger than that without feeding. By phylogenetic analysis of partial 16 S rRNA gene, we detected several clones related to symbionts of deep sea organisms in Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria, and Flavobacteria, from a crab with H 2 S feeding. The symbiont-related clones were grouped into four different groups: Gammaproteobacteria in marine epibiont group I, Sulfurovum-affiliated Epsilonproteobacteria, Osedax mucofloris endosymbiont-affiliated Epsilonproteobacteria, and Flavobacteria closely related to CFB group bacterial epibiont of Rimicaris exoculata.

40|$|A {{physiological}} {{study was}} carried out {{to determine the effects}} of temperature, quantity of food fed, feeding activity and size class on the oxygen consumption and ammonia production of the South African abalone Haliotis midae L [...] A set of intermittent flow respirometer chambers were used in a recirculating system to measure the oxygen consumption rates of fed (postprandial) and unfed (postabsorptive) abalone for three different size classes (15, 30, and 50 mm) at three different temperatures (16 °, 20 ° and 23 °C) over a 24 hour period. Ammonia production rates and food consumption rates were simultaneously determined. Oxygen consumption and Ammonia production rates per gram abalone were linear functions of abalone size, temperature, and mass of food consumed. Oxygen consumption and ammonia production rates were found to increase proportionally to temperature and in inverse proportion to abalone size. These rates were significantly higher for fed as opposed to unfed abalone. Equations were derived to predict oxygen consumption and ammonia production for fed and unfed animals for a range of temperatures and size classes of abalone. A 96 h LC 50 lethal toxicity test for exposure to ammonia established 1. 08 mg. 1 · 1 of unionised ammonia as the lethal limit. A test on the long term effects on growth of acute exposure (12 h) to various sublethal concentrations of ammonia showed no significant effects on growth for concentrations below 0. 88 mg. 1 'l.
