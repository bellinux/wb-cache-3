This article presents two studies in which risk appraisal was investigated with a new text-completion method.

A growing body of evidence support efficacy of statins in LE-PAD due to the ability of both reducing cardiovascular risk and improving walking distance and, hence, quality of life. Consequently, statin therapy should be considered in all LE-PAD patients and new LDL-cholesterol targets should be reached. Conclusions Our opinion is that statin therapy remains still underutilized or with inadequate dosage, so therapy of LE-PAD patients should be improved to obtain all the demonstrated benefits of statins. </p...|$|E

We test eight different communication formats employing varying combinations of textual <b>risk</b> <b>descriptions,</b> comparative <b>risk</b> information, stacked bar graphs illustrating the proportion of future land users at risk, and textual summaries and/or graphical histograms presenting uncertainty.

In the current research Williams and Pollock’s cry of pain model provided the template for assessing predictors of self-harm or suicide. For three months, all new arrivals at a local prison were invited to complete baseline questionnaires to assess factors derived from the cry of pain model. It was hypothesised that the factors derived from the model (perceived stress, defeat, entrapment and absence of rescue factors) would be predictive of self-harm and suicide risk and would distinguish prior self-harmers from non self-harmers.

The challenges with this practice lies with knowledge-based uncertainties which renders risk expression and estimation, hence components’ risk-based prioritisation, subjective to the assessor – even for the same case study. In this paper, a new risk assessment framework is developed to improve the fidelity and consistency of prioritisation of components of complex offshore engineering systems based on expert judgement. Unlike other frameworks, such as the Failure Mode and Effect Criticality Analysis, it introduces two additional dimensions: variables and parameters, to allow more effective scoring. These additional dimensions provide the much needed and uniform information that will assist experts with the estimation of probability of occurrence, severity of consequence and safeguards, herein referred to as 3 -D methodology.

This study investigated the communication of risk-related information between DRM actors, and how to present such information in order to improve its usefulness as a basis for decision-making. Two experiments were conducted to investigate the issue. The first related to the type of hazard, while the second examined the presentation of likelihood and consequences. We addressed two research questions: Does the presentation of a <b>risk</b> <b>description</b> influence its perceived usefulness for decision-making in a DRM system?

40|$|International audienceThe {{diversity}} of chemicals used in hospitals (detergents-disinfectants, alcohol-based hand sanitizers, drugs, etc.) and {{recent developments in}} indoor air quality regulation of public access buildings require {{a better understanding of}} chemical risks in this particular environment. We developed a methodology for semi-quantitative chemical risk assessments in this environment to prioritize inhalation risks by sector and chemical. This methodology is based on a similar approach in the workplace that defines classes of exposures and of hazards. Their combination produces a risk matrix. Four criteria were used to determine the exposure classes: quantity and frequency of the chemical's use, volatility (vapor pressure), and the type of collective protective equipment associated with each area. The hazard class is also derived from four criteria: classification as carcinogenic, mutagenic, or toxic to reproduction, the existence of a toxicity reference value, occupational exposure limit values, and risk phrases (official <b>risk</b> <b>descriptions,</b> on labels, data sheets, etc). This methodology was tested in the Rennes University Hospital (Rennes, France) in five different hospital areas, with a specific survey undertaken to collect data about chemicals in each area. The results show the spatial specificity of chemical risks. Among the various sites analysed, the chemical risks of two require priority attention: the parasitology-mycology laboratory and patients' rooms. Because of their wide use in the hospital and the volatility of some of their components (alcohols), detergents-disinfectants contribute to increasing risk levels in all areas.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} for risk analysis of maritime transportation systems, where risk analysis is understood {{as a tool for}} argumentative decision support. Uncertainty is given a more prominent role than in the current state of art in the maritime transportation application area, and various tools are presented for analyzing uncertainty. A two-stage <b>risk</b> <b>description</b> is applied. In the first stage, Bayesian Network (BN) modeling is applied for probabilistic risk quantification. The model functions as a communication and argumentation tool, serving as an aid to thinking in a qualitative evidence and assumption effect assessment. The evidence assessment is used together with a sensitivity analysis to select alternative hypotheses for the risk quantification, while the assumption effect assessment is used to convey an argumentation beyond the model. Based on this, a deliberative uncertainty judgment is made in the second risk analysis stage, which is supplemented with a global strength of evidence assessment. The framework is applied to a case study of oil spill from tanker collisions, aimed at response capacity planning and ecological risk assessment. The BN-model is a proactive and transferable tool for assessing the occurrence of various spill sizes in a sea area. While the case study uses evidence specific to the Gulf of Finland, the model and risk analysis approach can be applied to other areas. Based on evaluation criteria and tests for the risk model and risk analysis, it is found that the model is a plausible representation of tanker collision oil spill risk...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} the problem of state {{estimation}} based on interval-valued stochastic descriptions of noise. To perform the estimation, we derive a probabilistic description of unobserved states conditioned on the observations, called a statistical inference rule. Moreover, we link the derivation of the rules to the notion of estimation risk. In the context of confident estimation, risk is defined as a variational expression dependent of the statistical inference rule. More specifically, we draw upon a compound <b>risk</b> <b>description,</b> comprising two additive terms. The a-level represents the first ingredient of risk and is found to be a function of the lower expectation of the statistical inference rule, while the second term represents the upper expectation of the rule’s fuzziness taken with respect to the observations. Both terms are connected through a variational parameter. Finally, the compound risk reduces into a function of the statistical inference rule and the variational parameter. Given this description of the compound risk and a fixed a-level, we treat the derivation of the statistical inference rule as a constrained minimisation problem, where the variational parameter depends on the fixed a-level. In other words, we attempt to obtain fuzzy inference rules, since {{at the same time we}} keep the estimation at an acceptable confidence level. We build our methodology upon spin models, a specific class of modelling structures with roots in statistical mechanics. State estimation in these models is possible only locally by considering a finite range of interactions among spins. It is exactly this locality that adds a stochastically described noise to the observations, given a log-linear function of observed and unobserved states. The statistical inference rule is then presented as a semi-linear combination of such local functions. Furthermore, we place the calculation of expectations, needed in order to form the compound risk, into a variational framework, thus calculating interval-valued rather than exact expectations...|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Risk managementThe main safety {{technique}} used for Subsea 7 work activities is hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA). This process {{shows how the}} work activities are conducted, supervised and managed correctly, in accordance with approved practices. The biggest challenge is communicating the risk {{out to the people}} executing the work. Make them understand the risk tied to the work. The goals with this master thesis were comparing different uncertainty factors and evaluate the different methods used in HIRA procedure. See what type of uncertainty tied to the procedures. What methods that are best in Subsea 7 type of operations. Finally investigate the information received from the vessel. Uncertainty tied to the HIRAs The main purpose was to prove that Subsea 7 had to take uncertainty into the calculation of risk. It shows that the <b>risk</b> <b>description</b> can be split into two parts, one covering events and consequences, and another that covers uncertainty. This acknowledges that risk cannot only be described and evaluated by referring to probabilities and evaluated consequences. It needs to be evaluated together with an uncertainty factor U. If Subsea 7 implement factor U they will reduce the hazards from occurring. Methods used to identify measure and communicate risk Subsea 7 HIRA contains parts of different risk identification methods and that is important for getting a better risk picture of the operation. The different techniques that are implemented are guidewords and task analysis. But it should also implement parts from SWIFT like “what if analysis”, this will question the procedures more. Also use FMECA on critical equipment so they don’t risk the whole operation stopping. That should give them better information about where the hazards are hidden. The best way of preparing the procedures is a combination of al the method evaluated, but that is time consuming. The HIRAs are a good tool for finding the hazards and calculating the risk level, but it can be improved by more precise information about where danger is hidden. Subsea 7 can try to upgrade the HIRAs with one or two columns. One with cause (cause of hazards) and split the corrective measures in proactive measures (actions that prevent hazards from occurring) and protective measures (measures that protect people, assets and environment from the hazards). That way the evaluated risk will be easier to communicate out to the people doing the work and they will understand the risk better. The majority of employers who responded to the survey generally felt “safe” regarding offshore hazards and “satisfied” regarding safety measures on board their vessel. The respondents felt that the communication between the office and vessel could be better, and make the safety procedures user-friendlier. That could be something to focus on when management are making the new safety procedures for Subsea 7...|$|E
