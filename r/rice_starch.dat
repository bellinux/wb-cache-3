However, it was never the grand international route envisaged by the kings of France as its traffic was limited to local and national trade.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The quality {{characteristics}} of brown rice polished with grains of four rice varieties (Hwaseonchal, Baegjinju, Ilpum and Goami) were examined. For the physical properties of native and fried brown <b>rice</b> <b>starches,</b> the gelatinization temperatures and enthalpies (determined with differential scanning calorimetry) of brown <b>rice</b> <b>starches</b> decreased with increasing amylose content. The pasting viscosities of native brown <b>rice</b> <b>starches</b> in distilled water {{were higher than}} those in HgCl 2 solution (as an α-amylase inhibitor). The highest viscosity of gelatinized starch was observed for the <b>starch</b> of Ilpum <b>rice</b> variety relative to other varieties.

40|$|The {{properties}} of blends of banana, potato, and <b>rice</b> <b>starches</b> were studied {{to assess their}} suitability as an alternate for chemically modified starches. The blends of banana, potato, and <b>rice</b> <b>starches</b> were prepared in the respective ratio of 1 : 3 : 2, 3 : 2 : 1, and 2 : 1 : 3. The blend with higher proportion of banana and <b>rice</b> <b>starches</b> (BPR- 213) showed highest water absorption capacity and oil absorption capacity. The blend with higher proportion of banana starch (BPR- 321) showed highest swelling power at 95 °C but lowest water solubility at 95 °C among other starch blends. The blend made with higher amount of potato starch (BPR- 132) had significantly higher paste clarity than other blends (p <  0. 05). The potato starch had significantly higher least gelation concentration than all other starches and their blends (p <  0. 05). The banana starch and blend with highest proportion of banana starch (BPR- 321) showed significantly lesser percent syneresis and thus highest freeze–thaw stability. Potato starch {{as well as it}} blends with greater amount of potato starch (BPR- 132) showed highest value for peak viscosity, hot paste viscosity, and final viscosity than other blends...|$|R
500|$|Sustenance for the UN {{troops in}} Korea {{was among the}} other {{logistical}} challenges confronting the UN {{in the early days}} of the war. There were no C rations in Korea and only a small reserve in Japan at the outbreak of the war. The Quartermaster General of the United States Army immediately began moving all available C rations and 5-in-1 B rations from the United States to the Far East. Field rations at first were largely the less nutritious and palatable World War II K rations. The UN had to rely on much of the US stock of World War II-era material for much of this phase of the war. Provisioning of the ROK troops was an equally important and difficult problem. The regular issue ration to ROK troops was rice or barley and fish. It consisted of about [...] of rice or barley, one half pound of biscuit, and one half pound of canned fish with spices. Often the cooked rice, made into balls and wrapped in cabbage leaves, was sour when it reached the combat troops on the line, and frequently it did not arrive at all. Occasionally, local purchase of foods on a basis of 200 Won ($0.05 USD) per day per man supplemented the issued ration. An improved ROK ration consisting of three menus, one for each daily meal, was ready in September 1950. It provided 3,210 calories, weighed , and consisted of <b>rice</b> <b>starch,</b> biscuits, rice cake, peas, kelp, fish, chewing gum, and condiments, and was packed in a waterproofed bag. With slight changes, this ration was found acceptable to the ROK troops and quickly put into production. It became the standard ration for them during the first year of the war.|$|E

40|$|The glycemic {{potency of}} rice {{depends upon the}} rate and extent of starch {{hydrolysis}} by pancreatic amylase and intestinal alpha-glucosidases. However, complexation of starch molecules with lipids is known to reduce the enzymic hydrolysis. In this study, we elucidated the varietal effect of <b>rice</b> <b>starches</b> on the formation of amylose-lipid complex, after cooking with palm oil, a common cooking oil. The amount of complexed lipid followed the order of black (2. 5 %), brown (2. 5 %), white (1. 5 %) and waxy (0. 5 %) <b>rice</b> <b>starches.</b> After heating with palm oil, the relative crystallinity of all the <b>rice</b> <b>starches</b> were destroyed whilst a V-type peak at 20 ° 2 θ was increased, indicating the formation of amylose-lipid complex. This is also suggested from the DSC data where the melting enthalpy increased significantly after cooking in palm oil for all rice samples. The formation of amylose-lipid complex reduced the in vitro starch digestibility, enhancing the resistance starch content whilst decreasing the rapid and slow digestion fractions of non-waxy varieties. The rate and extent of in vitro starch hydrolysis seems {{to be dependent on}} {{the presence or absence of}} amylose fraction. With the mechanistic details, the present study suggests the applicability of palm oil addition during the rice cooking to enhance its nutritional functionality...|$|R

Peak viscosity (PV) of all native <b>rice</b> <b>starches</b> was little affected at pH 4 and 10, while hot paste viscosity (HPV) and cool paste (final) viscosity (CPV) were generally lower at pH 4 and higher at pH 10 {{as compared with}} that at pH 7. The PV, HPV, and CPV of γ-irradiated starches were higher at pH 4 and lower at pH 10 than pH 7. All viscosity characteristics of native <b>rice</b> <b>starches</b> were reduced in stronger alkali (pH 11. 5) or acidic (pH 2. 5) solutions. However, the γ-irradiated starches were substantially higher at pH 2. 5 but lower at pH 11. 5, indicating {{that the effect of}} irradiation was highly pH dependent. The swelling volume of irradiated ZF 504 and JY 293 starch at all irradiation levels was higher at pH 4 than pH 7, while the values were lowest at pH 2. 5. The irradiated ZXN and XS starches had higher swelling volumes at pH 4 and pH 2. 5 than pH 7. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis showed that γ-irradiation caused progressively lower gelatinization peak temperature (T p) and higher gelatinization range (T r) at pH 7. T p was higher and T r was lower at a much stronger acidic condition (pH 1) for both native and irradiated starches. The possibility of using viscosity changes in low pH for the detection of irradiated starch was discussed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the ability of three native starches from Indonesia to stabilize oil in water emulsion with and without the addition of lecithin as surfactant. Breadfruit, bengkuang (jicama), and <b>rice</b> <b>starches</b> were extracted from local sources in Banda Aceh - Indonesia. Two variables studied were type of starches and the amount of oil added into emulsion (15 and 25 %). Proximate analysis showed that the starch content of breadfruit, jicama and rice were 77. 57, 67. 41, and 80. 51 % respectively and the amylose content were 20. 50, 16. 5, and 13. 6 %. Results showed that the emulsification index (EI) of emulsion prepared with jicama and <b>rice</b> <b>starches</b> were lower than the EI of emulsion stabilized by breadfruit starch. However, the viscosity of breadfruit emulsion was higher than the other two emulsions. Storage stability test in room temperature also demonstrated that oil in water emulsion made from breadfruit starch had the lowest separation rate over storage period compared to jicama and rice emulsions. Overall, stabilization of 25 % oil in breadfruit emulsion was slightly better than addition of 15 % oil where the visible boundaries or serum layer of the emulsion was in the range of 5 - 6 ml at the end of storage test. Breadfruit starch was further modified by reacting it with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) to produce OSA-modified breadfruit starch. The degree of substitution (DS) of OSA modified breadfruit starch was 0. 0231. OSA-modified breadfruit starch is highly potential to be used as food emulsifier and therefore studied further to examine its ability to stabilize oil in water emulsion. </p...|$|R
