40|$|Past {{disposal}} of industrial solvents into unregulated landfills {{is a significant}} source of groundwater contamination. In 2009, we began investigating a former unregulated landfill with known trichloroethene (TCE) contamination. Our objective was to pinpoint the location of the plume and treat the TCE using in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO). We accomplished this by using electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) to survey the landfill and map the subsurface lithology. We then used the ERI maps to guide direct push groundwater sampling. A TCE plume (100 - 600 µg L- 1) was identified in a low permeable silty-clay aquifer (Kh = 0. 5 m d- 1) that was within 6 m of ground surface and underlain by an even lower permeable zone (Kh = 0. 04 m d- 1). Because injecting a liquid oxidant into the low permeable aquifer would have been difficult, we manufactured slow-release potassium permanganate candles (SRPCs) to treat the TCE. SRPCs were prepared by heating and mixing KMnO 4 and paraffin wax at a 4. 6 to 1 ratio (w/w), and then pouring the heated mixture into circular cardboard molds (91. 4 cm long) that were either 5. 1 cm (2 in) or 7. 6 cm (3 in) in diameter. For comparison, we inserted equal masses of SRPCs (7. 6 -cm vs 5. 1 -cm diameter) into a low permeable aquifer (4. 6 m vertical thickness) in staggered rows that intersected the TCE plume. The 5. 1 -cm diam candles were inserted directly into the formation using direct push hollow rods at 21 locations. The 7. 6 -cm SRPCs were encased in slotted containers and placed in 10 permanent wells. Pneumatic <b>recirculators</b> that emitted small air bubbles were placed below the 7. 6 -cm SRPCs in the second year to facilitate permanganate distribution. Results obtained prior to inserting <b>recirculators</b> showed a 64 to 82 % reduction of TCE in the 7. 6 -cm candle treatment zone after 342 d and between 64 to 100 % decrease in associated ethene degradates. These results support using slow-release permanganate candles as a means of treating chlorinated solvents in low permeable aquifers. Advisor: Steve Comfor...|$|R

More precisely it overloads the package which Berz developped at the now defunct SSC-Central design group. It also overload a library based on Berz’s package called Lielib 1 and developped by Forest. FPP most salient feature {{is to create a}} Taylor-Real poly-morphic type which changes shape at execution time. To do so using Berz’s original package, we use a piece of code based on a Fortran 77 prototype of J. Bengtsson. In fact, polymorphism at execution time is an idea of Bengts-son. This is to be contrasted with interpreted polymor-phism which is the mechanism which underpins the code COSY-INFINITY [4] of Berz. Both are valid ideas and can even be combined simultaneously. This is not done in FPP. The user of FPP writes a standard (symplectic) integra-tor [5, 6, 7] which simply pushes particles through a lattice. If the real variables “real(8) ” are replaced everywhere by a new type called REAL 8 then Taylor series can be pro-duced thanks to the underlying package of Berz. It {{should be pointed out that}} our decision to extract Tay-lor series directly from an integrator rather than using tech-niques such as those found in COSY-INIFINITY is dictated by the physics of large (circular) machines.

40|$|Three major {{facilities}} {{have been proposed}} for the precision study of neutrino oscillation parameters, the Neutrino Factory, the Betabeam and the Superbeam. Of these, the Neutrino Factory offers high precision measurement of oscillation parameters [1]. The Neutrino Factory generates neutrinos by firing protons onto a target {{in order to produce}} pions. The pions decay to muons which are captured before being accelerated to 25 GeV and stored in racetrackshaped rings where they decay to neutrinos. In this note the pion decay channel, longitudinal drift, adiabatic buncher, phase rotation and ionisation cooling system that make up the Neutrino Factory muon front end are reviewed. THE NEUTRINO FACTORY The baseline design of the International Design Study (IDS) is shown in Figure 1. Proton bunches with RMS time spread in the range 1 - 3 ns from a 4 MW proton driver are fired at kinetic energies of 5 - 15 GeV onto a target where pions are produced. The intensity of the beam may be sufficient to destroy non-moving solid targets; moving solid or liquid targets are under investigation. Pions are captured in a 20 T solenoid which is tapered along the accelerator axis. Pions decay to muons with a large energy spread. The beam is transported through a long solenoid for an energy-time correlation to develop, the muons are bunched and then the energy spread reduced using phase rotation. The beam is subsequently cooled using ionisation cooling {{to increase the number of}} muons that are accepted by the accelerating system. The beam is then accelerated as fast as possible, to minimise decay losses, in a series of 3 linacs. In order to use equipment efficiently, the latter two linacs each have <b>recirculators</b> that return the beam for multiple passes through the same cavities. Next, a high acceptance Fixed Field Alternating Gradient machine (FFAG) is used to take the muons up to 25 GeV.

40|$|This is a {{description}} of the basic ideas behind the ``Polymorphic Tracking Code'' or PTC. PTC is truly a ``kick code'' or symplectic integrator in the tradition of TRACYII, SixTrack, and TEAPOT. However it separates correctly the mathematical atlas of charts and the magnets at a structural level by implementing a ``restricted fibre bundle. '' The resulting structures allow backward propagation and recirculation, something not possible in standard tracking codes. Also PTC is polymorphic in handling real (single, double and even quadruple precision) and Taylor series. Therefore it has all the tools associated to the TPSA packages: Lie methods, Normal Forms, Cosy-Infinity capabilities, beam envelopes for radiation, etc., as well as parameter dependence on-the-fly. However PTC is an integrator, and as such, one must, generally, adhere to the Talman ``exactness'' view of modelling. Incidentally, it supports exact sector and rectangular bends as well. Of course, one can certainly bypass its integrator and the user is free to violate Talman's principles on his own; PTC provides the tools to dig one's grave but not the encouragement. The reader will find in Appendix B a PowerPoint presentation of FPP. The presentation is a bit out of date but it gives a good idea of FPP which is essential to PTC. FPP is a stand-alone library and can be used by anyone with a FORTRAN 90 compiler. This presentation is also, to be honest, a place where the authors intend to document very incompletely nearly two years of work: the development of FPP and subsequently that of PTC. Our ultimate intention is to morph PTC completely into MAD-X. The code MAD-X is an upgrade of MAD- 8 and not of the C++ CLASSIC based code MAD- 9. The present document does not address when and how this will be done. It is also our goal to link, if possible, PTC with CAD programs for the design of complex follow-the-terrain beam lines.
