40|$|Drill-press jig used to <b>remove</b> {{improperly}} installed <b>rivets.</b> Drillpress jig {{makes possible}} to drill accurately-centered, straight holes through rivets. Key component of jig is a drill bushing with spherical recess machined into base. Contour of recess matches contour of rivet head. Operator holds jig handle {{with one hand}} and controls drill with other. Handle and screw head hold drill bit in place over center of rivet so rivet drilled out through its axis. With <b>rivet</b> <b>removed,</b> parts separated and refastened or reused elsewhere...|$|R
2500|$|A sizzler is a metal chain or {{combination}} of chains that is hung across a cymbal, creating a distinctive metallic sound when the cymbal is struck {{similar to that}} of a sizzle cymbal. Using a sizzler is the non-destructive alternative to drilling holes in a cymbal and putting metal rivets in the holes. Another benefit of using a [...] "sizzler" [...] chain is that the chain can be removed and the cymbal will return to its normal sound (in contrast, a cymbal with rivets would have to have the <b>rivets</b> <b>removed).</b>|$|R

25|$|When it is {{necessary}} to <b>remove</b> <b>rivets,</b> one of the rivet's heads is sheared off with a cold chisel. The rivet is then driven out with a hammer and punch.|$|R
50|$|If the <b>rivets</b> are <b>removed</b> from a sizzle cymbal its {{previous}} tone will be restored, despite the small holes {{left in the}} cymbal. Large or numerous holes drilled in a cymbal will make the sound dryer, but ordinary rivet holes make an inaudible difference. Rivet holes may slightly decrease the resale value of a cymbal, {{but this is not}} usually the case with vintage cymbals.|$|R
50|$|The second bridge {{opened on}} 20 June 1887 and remains in use. In 2003, a Â£20.85 million {{strengthening}} and refurbishment {{project on the}} bridge won the British Construction Industry Civil Engineering Award, in consideration of the staggering scale and logistics involved. More than 1000 MT of bird droppings were scraped off the ironwork lattice of the bridge using hand tools, and bagged into 25 kg sacks. Hundreds of thousands of <b>rivets</b> were <b>removed</b> and replaced, all work being done in very exposed conditions high over a firth with fast-running tides.|$|R
50|$|The entire {{bridge was}} {{fabricated}} using hot steel rivets, which {{are impossible to}} heat treat and so remain relatively soft. Analysis showed that these could fail by shearing under extreme stress. Therefore, at most locations each given <b>rivet</b> was <b>removed</b> by breaking off {{the head with a}} jack-hammer buster and punching out the old rivet, the hole precision reamed and the old rivets replaced with heat-treated high-strength tension-control TC bolts and nuts. Most bolts had domed heads placed facing traffic so they looked similar to the rivets that were removed.contract 04-0435U4, 1999-2004. This work had to be performed with great care as the steel of the structure had for many years been painted with lead based paint, which had to be carefully removed and contained by workers with extensive protective gear.|$|R
5|$|Competitive video gamers and referees {{stress the}} game's {{high level of}} {{difficulty}} compared to other classic arcade games. Winning the game requires patience {{and the ability to}} accurately time Mario's ascent. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game also gives the player a score. Points are awarded for the following: leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer power-up; collecting items such as hats, parasols, and purses (presumably belonging to Pauline); <b>removing</b> <b>rivets</b> from platforms; and completing each stage (determined by a steadily decreasing bonus counter). The player typically receives three lives with a bonus awarded for the first 7,000 points, although this can be modified via the game's built in DIP switches. One life is lost whenever Mario touches Donkey Kong or any enemy object, falls too far through a gap or off the end of a platform, or lets the bonus counter reach zero.|$|R
5|$|Objects from Titanic {{have been}} {{exhibited}} for many years, though {{only a few}} were retrieved before {{the discovery of the}} wreck in 1985. The Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia has a collection of wooden fragments and an intact deckchair plucked from the sea by the Canadian search vessels that recovered the victims' bodies. Various other museums, including the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich and the SeaCity Museum in Southampton, have objects donated by survivors and relatives of victims, including some items that were retrieved from the bodies of victims. More donated Titanic artifacts {{are to be found in}} the Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool and the Titanic Historical Society's museum in Indian Orchard, Springfield, Massachusetts. The latter's collection includes items such as the life jacket of Madeleine Astor, the wife of millionaire Titanic victim John Jacob Astor IV, a <b>rivet</b> which was <b>removed</b> from the hull before Titanic went to sea, an ice warning which never reached the bridge, a restaurant menu and a sample square of carpet from a First Class stateroom.|$|R
40|$|Fatigue tests {{carried out}} on three {{configurations}} (unexpanded, cold expanded and riveted) of fiber metal laminate material clearly demonstrated the beneficial effect of riveting compared to cold expansion in zero load transfer joints, for an approximately equivalent level of interference. Digital image correlation {{was used to measure}} the in-plane surface strain on cold expanded and riveted coupons during fatigue loading, and for the first time, digital image correlation was combined with pressure sensitive films to measure the strains resulting from the application of the rivet, including those under the rivet head. A comparison of the resultant strain field showed that the application of a rivet significantly reduces the stress concentration at the central hole and is effective in extending fatigue life. Some <b>rivet</b> heads were <b>removed</b> by milling, and the results from subsequent fatigue tests were used together with closed-form calculations to explain the findings of this study. It was concluded that the beneficial effect of riveting was less as a result of interference hole filling {{on the part of the}} rivet shank, but more a combination of the effect of interference and compression through the joint thickness.

40|$|Tests {{have been}} {{conducted}} in the NACA 8 -foot high-speed wind tunnel {{to determine the effect}} of exposed rivet heads and spot welds on wing drag. Most of the tests were made with an airfoil of 5 -foot chord. The air speed was varied from 80 to 500 miles per hour and the lift coefficient from 0 to 0. 30. The increases in the drag of the 5 -foot airfoil varied from 6 %, due to countersunk rivets, to 27 %, due to 3 / 32 -inch brazier-head rivets, with the rivets in a representative arrangement. The drag increases caused by protruding rivet heads were roughly proportional to the height of the heads. With the front row of rivets well forward, changes in spanwise pitch had negligible effects on drag unless the pitch was more than 2. 5 % of the chord. Data are presented for evaluating the drag reduction attained by <b>removing</b> <b>rivets</b> from the forward part of the wing surface; for example, it is shown that over 70 % of the rivet drag is caused by the rivets on the forward 30 % of the airfoil in a typical case...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} detect multi-site fatigue cracks located under flush-head rivets, {{automated}} eddy current equipment is required. To assure a reliable system, the eddy current probe must be centered easily over the installed rivets. To meet these requirements, the NDE Group at NASA LaRC developed the Self-Nulling Rotating Eddy Current Probe System (SNRECPS) {{which will be}} referred to as RPS in this document. The system was evaluated at the FAA, NDI Validation Center, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The system was capable of detecting a 0. 032 inch long crack with a 90 / 95 % PoD. Further evaluations were conducted at Boeing in Long Beach, California. These evaluations included fatigue cracks and notches in a range from 0. 025 to 0. 100 inch long under flush-head aluminum rivets, and titanium or steel flush-head fasteners. The results of these tests are reported herein. Subsequently, the system was loaned to the USAF Structures Laboratory for the purpose of detecting and measuring short cracks under flush-head rivets in a variety of fatigue test specimens. The inspection task was to detect and plot crack growth from numbered fasteners in lettered rows. In January, 1998, the system was taken to Northwest Airlines Maintenance Base, in Atlanta, to inspect a DC- 9, for multi-site cracks in three circumferential splices. The aircraft had 83, 000 cycles. The inspection was conducted at 30 kHz from longeron 5 left to longeron 5 right. The system was calibrated using a 0, 030 EDM first layer notch. The instrument gain was set to 19 mV from the notch. The reject level was set at 10 mV and the unflawed fasteners yielded a signal amplitude of 2 to 3 mV. Only one fastener location, out of about 2, 500 tested, yielded a signal of 58 mV. The <b>rivet</b> was <b>removed</b> and visually evaluated. It appeared to be a slight gouge in the counter-sink zone. No fatigue cracks were detected. The same fastener locations were also inspected using the Boeing MAUS system at 60 kHz. No cracks were detected. Thus far, the rotating probe eddy current system {{has been found to be}} very user friendly and capable of detecting first layer cracks on the order of 0. 030 inch long or longer...|$|R
