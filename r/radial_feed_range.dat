In this paper, a macro-micro 3 D-FE model of the radial-axial ring rolling of TA 15 titanium alloy has been developed under ABAQUS software. The ring blank transferring from heating furnace to rolling mill, rolling and cooling after rolling during the whole process are considered in the FE model.

40|$|This {{technical}} brief is {{the extension}} of our previous work developed by Zhang et al. (2016, "Effects of Process Parameters on White Layer Formation and Morphology in Hard Turning of AISI 52100 Steel," ASME J. Manuf. Sci. Eng., 138 (7), p. 074502). We investigated the effects of sequential cuts on microstructure alteration in hard turning of AISI 52100 steel. Samples undergone five sequential cuts are prepared with different <b>radial</b> <b>feed</b> rates and cutting speeds. Optical microscope and X-ray diffraction (XRD) are employed to analyze the microstructures of white layer and bulk materials after sequential cutting processes. Through the studies we first find out the increasing of white layer thickness in the sequential cuts. This trend in sequential cuts does work for different process parameters, belonging to the usually used ones in hard turning of AISI 52100 steel. In addition, {{we find that the}} white layer thickness increases with the increasing of cutting speed, as recorded i n the literature. To reveal the mechanism of white layer formation, XRD measurements of white layers generated in the sequential cuts are made. As a result retained austenite in white layers is identified, which states that the thermally driven phase transformations dominate the white layer formation, rather than the severe plastic deformation in cuts. Furthermore, retained austenite contents in sequential cuts with different process parameters are discussed. While using a smaller <b>radial</b> <b>feed</b> rate, the greater retained austenite content found in experiments is attributed to the generated compressive surface residual stresses, which possibly restricts the martensitic transformation...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. In life {{extending}} and refurbishing old {{power station}} plant, {{the following question}} must be addressed: Does one maintain current configuration, {{which was based on}} the technology of 1960, or make use of current power utility technology trends, and change the power station's configuration. This specific problem involves four existing Eskom power stations, with an approximate combined replacement value of R 7 billion. All these stations have the capability of using a common steam <b>feed</b> <b>range</b> to supply superheated steam to the turbo-generator sets. This common steam <b>feed</b> <b>range</b> becomes very maintenance intensive in its "old age". Hence the need for this study into the feasibility of its refurbishment. This common steam <b>feed</b> <b>range</b> configuration was considered state-of-the-art in the mid- 1900 's, but is currently not the practised technology. This is primarily due to the technology advancement into reheat boilers, making control of a range type configuration impossible. Monte Carlo simulation provides an effective, holistic decision mechanism, that is free from bias, emotions and conjecture. Hence the simulation product, highlighted in this dissertation, will have solved an industrial problem finally and effectively, by ensuring that for a relatively small cost of building the simulation models, major capital expenditure estimates can be accurate, with a confidence in the return on investment. This paper discusses the use of Monte Carlo simulation modelling as an engineering analysis tool, for the analysis of two power station configuration options, i. e. with a steam <b>feed</b> <b>range</b> and without. Firstly, an investigation into the selection of which computer language to use as a development tool is presented. The Monte Carlo simulation technique is then explained, and simulation models are built of the two power station configurations. The models, which are built using SIMSCRIPT 11. 5 simulation language to represent the real world in each configuration option, are then discussed. The availability analysis is developed, and conclusions and recommendations are discussed, as presented in the report to Eskom Management...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a theoretical analysis model and a design procedure to synthesize aperture coupled microstrip patch arrays using a <b>radial</b> line <b>feed.</b> As a first topic, a lossy radial transmission line model is developed to predict slot coupling. With the reciprocity technique and a moment method analysis, key design parameters for realizing a radial line slot array are modeled to formulate the slot coupling problem. By applying the sequential array technique for circular polarization to radial line slot array design, good performance is found for both axial ratio and return loss bandwidth. The aperture efficiency degradation of a sequential array having elliptically polarized elements is investigated by evaluating the gain versus element spacing and polarization ellipticity. A sample design for a 18 cm aperture diameter radial line slot array with 42 % aperture efficiency validates these theoretical approaches. Next, an aperture coupled microstrip patch array with a <b>radial</b> line <b>feed</b> is analyzed by modifying the analysis model of the radial line slot array. By using linearly polarized aperture coupled patches as radiating elements, sampled designs of aperture coupled microstrip patch arrays using <b>radial</b> line <b>feeds</b> are used to demonstrate the feasibility of this new structure. ...|$|R
