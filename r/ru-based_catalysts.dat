Ceria-zirconia (molar ratio 75 / 25) catalysts doped with Pt, Au, Ru or Fe (2 % by weight) and containing K (7 % by weight) were prepared by a modified citrate method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, surface area and pore volume measurements. The behavior of the catalysts in the soot combustion and NOx removal was separately analyzed by means of temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), isothermal combustion and isothermal NOx adsorption experiments. The results showed that all the ceria/zirconia based catalysts are more active than Pt-K/Al 2 O 3 in soot combustion; the Ru-containing system also showed NOx storage performances comparable to Pt-K/Al 2 O 3.

Efficient CM is demonstrated in the case of acrolein acetals providing a new route to access Z-α,β-unsaturated acetals and aldehydes. For a variety of other allylic-substituted olefins, reactivity was lower but could be correlated with the structure of the catalyst and substrate. The implications of the observed reactivity are discussed and contextualized with regard to reactivity of previous metathesis catalysts.

To improve its efficiency noble-metals co-catalysts are often used. Their cost drives research on alternative materials and molybdenum sulphide {{emerged as a}} promising one. 1 In this work other transition metal sulphides (TMS) were screened and reasons of their efficiency are investigated. Catalysts were prepared using a solution deposition method already reported by Girel et al. 1 Eight TMS were deposited on CristalACTiVTM PC 500 (TiO 2 -anatase) (MSx/TiO 2 with M=Cu, Mo, Ag, Pt, Hg, Co, Ni, Ru). HER performance was measured for the conversion of isopropanol in hydrogen. Catalyst are compared based on their quantum efficiency at 20 °C and on the apparent activation energy (Ea) measured. (Fig. 1). All of the eight TMS act as a co-catalyst of TiO 2, they have an higher QE and a lower Ea than the support alone. RuS 2 is the best one with QE = 2. 2 % and Ea ̴ 22 kJ/mol. Valence band of Ag, Ni and <b>Ru-based</b> <b>catalyst</b> has been investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In addition to the well-known TiO 2 signature, 2 TMS contribution was observed. Preliminary results show a correlation between {{the size of this}} contribution and the Ea measured. In comparison with Pt/TiO 2, TMS photocatalytic efficiency are lower but their cost is also roughly decreased. Deeper investigations must be done to support the hypothesis of a relationship between electronic structure and activity...|$|R
