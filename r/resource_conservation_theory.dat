After an introduction of the most relevant resource theories and their current application in Occupational and Organizational Psychology – Key <b>resource</b> <b>theories,</b> <b>Conservation</b> of <b>Resources</b> <b>Theory,</b> Resource Theory of Social exchange, and Selective Optimization with Compensation Theory – the opportunities and challenges for future research are outlined, {{as well as the}} innovative trends emerging from the contributions in this special section...|$|R
40|$|Competence {{development}} {{is considered a}} preventive strategy of burnout. At an organizational context some competences could be linked as precursors or consequences. In self-assessment of competence development, students perceive stress tolerance as a priority competence to ameliorate. Moreover employers and recruitment consultants agree {{that this is a}} new authentic challenge for organizations. The main reasons of this result are debated, this study should consider the importance of competence development from a holistic point of view. In addition it considers the exploration of the relationship between stress tolerance and competence development, according to <b>Conservation</b> <b>Resources</b> (COR) <b>theory</b> (Hobfoll 1988, 1989, 1998, 2004) where the resource loss is considered the principal component in the stress proces...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} and critically investigates core {{features of the}} safe minimum standard of conservation (SMS), as outlined by Ciriacy-Wantrup, which have been neglected, de-emphasized or poorly interpreted. Different ensuing interpretations and developments of SMS, aimed at giving it a theoretical basis and operationalizing it, are scrutinized. It is shown that the definition of features such as irreversibility, uncertainty, threshold and critical zone imply a socio-economic and institutional approach of SMS. Hence, endeavors to find a formal and positive foundation (game theory) or to identify SMS {{as an adjunct to}} cost-benefit analysis are unsuccessful. Rather, approaches assigning the definition of acceptable resource use to politics and society conform with SMS (e. g. by political norm setting or societal discourse). Furthermore, the paper discusses close normative relatives of SMS and identifies intragenerational distributional justice as a crucial variable for setting SMS. It is argued that SMS is a socio-economic and institutional approach; this should be the basis for further discussion and development of SMS.

40|$|This study {{draws from}} the <b>resource</b> {{depletion}} and <b>conservation</b> <b>theories</b> {{to develop a}} process model of informal caregiving. The model includes the burnout as a key mediator {{of the relationship between}} benefit/threat appraisals and critical outcomes including perceived physical health, depression and life satisfaction. Methods: A self-report questionnaire was utilized to collect relevant data from 137 informal caregivers of older adults. The proposed model and hypotheses were evaluated with the Structural Equation Modeling method using the software EQS. Results: The relatively high reported levels of emotional exhaustion and reduced personal accomplishment established the relevance of the burnout construct for informal caregivers. In addition, the test of the proposed model provides support for the hypothesis that burnout is an important mediator in the appraisal process model of informal caregiving. However, while burnout effectively mediates the influence of threat appraisals, its role in mediating the effect of benefit appraisals is mixed. Conclusion: The proposed model and results highlight the significance and potential for utilizing a process approach for understanding the link between appraisals and outcomes for informal caregivers. More importantly, the proposed model suggests that attention must be paid toward burnout tendencies to reveal fruitful intervention directions for researchers and practitioners to enhance the positive outcomes of informal caregivers, and maintain their psychological and physical well-being...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{tendency}} in research on common property to neglect the influence that national and international developments might have in <b>resource</b> <b>conservation.</b> The environmental literature, on the other hand, suggests {{that the creation of}} extractive reserves in Brazilian Amazonia in 1990 and thus the recognition of the rubber tappers' common property rights to their forests have been influenced by such developments. Extractive reserves have also been {{considered one of the most}} important initiatives of the Brazilian government to address the problem of deforestation in Amazonia. Attempts at examining their capacity to ensure <b>resource</b> <b>conservation</b> through the <b>theory</b> on common property have been, however, relatively scarce. This thesis thus examines extractive reserves using the theory of common property as a theoretical framework and includes in the analysis a wider range of factors than those usually considered in the existing literature on common property regimes. The thesis reviews the evolution of national and international developments in relation to Amazonia during the 1980 s and, against this background, it examines the process that led to the establishment of extractive reserves. The thesis then proceeds to explore the property rights institutions of the Chico Mendes drawing on the evidence collected through semi-structured interviews with the reserve inhabitants. The research conducted identifies local, national and international factors which have influenced the capacity of the rubber tappers to ensure the sustainable use of their resources before and after the creation of extractive reserves. The evidence and analysis presented suggests that the capacity of the Chico Mendes Reserve to promote the sustainable use of the forest is limited. There are indications, however, that the reserve inhabitants could develop mechanisms to conserve their resources if external support continues but, at the same time, does not hinder their autonomy and interest in managing the forest. The thesis concludes by suggesting that developments in the national and international arenas can play a crucial role in relation to common property institutions...|$|R
