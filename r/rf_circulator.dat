40|$|A {{low-cost}} reconfigurable microwave transceiver using software-defined radar {{is proposed}} for medical imaging. The device, which uses generic software-defined radio (SDR) technology, {{paves the way}} to replace the costly and bulky vector network analyzer currently used in the research of microwave-based medical imaging systems. In this paper, calibration techniques are presented to enable the use of SDR technology in a biomedical imaging system. With the aid of an <b>RF</b> <b>circulator,</b> a virtual 1 -GHz-wide pulse is generated by coherently adding multiple frequency spectrums together. To verify the proposed system for medical imaging, experiments are conducted using a circular scanning system and directional antenna. The system successfully detects small targets embedded in a liquid emulating the average properties of different human tissues...|$|E
30|$|Apart {{from the}} errors {{that can be}} {{identified}} and quantified by EM simulation, practical devices are also plagued by the infamous problem of standing waves. Non-ideal connectors lead to frequency-dependent port impedances, which in turn enter the formulas (36), (39), (41) and lead to unpredictable variations of the quality factor. This issue, if not properly handled by input and output <b>RF</b> <b>circulators</b> or isolators, or use of high-precision connectors, is arguably {{the main source of}} quality factor deviations in devices.|$|R
40|$|We {{built up}} a system {{composed}} of one dipole transmitter and four groups of Yagi-Uda array. Aluminum foils were used to reflect RF wave back to dipole transmitter. The input impedance of this system has negative value so that this system works like a powerless <b>RF</b> amplifier. A <b>circulator</b> was used to separate input and reflected waves from the dipole transmitter. It is observed that the amplitude of reflected wave is 3. 0 times of input signal. The output power is 9. 0 times of input power...|$|R
40|$|The Low Energy Demonstration Accelerator (LEDA) being {{constructed}} at Los Alamos National Laboratory {{will serve as}} the prototype for the low energy section of Acceleration Production of Tritium (APT) accelerator. The APT accelerator requires over 244 RF systems each with a continuous wave output power of 1 MW. The reliability and availability of these RF systems is critical to the successful operation of APT plant and prototypes of these systems are being developed and demonstrated on LEDA. The first completed LEDA RF systems are three, 1. 2 MW, 350 MHz, continuous wave, klystrons driving a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ). This paper presents the design and test results for these RF systems including the klystrons, cathode power supply, <b>circulators,</b> <b>RF</b> vacuum windows, and RF components. The three RF systems driving the RFQ use the accelerating structure as a power combiner and this places some unique requirements on the RF systems. These requirements and corresponding operational implications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The Low Energy Demonstration Accelerator (LEDA) being {{constructed}} at Los Alamos {{will serve as}} the prototype for the low energy section of the Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT) accelerator. The APT accelerator requires over 200 RF systems each with a continuous wave output power of 1 MW. The reliability and availability of these RF systems is critical to the successful operation of the APT plant and prototypes of these systems are being developed and demonstrated on LEDA. The RF system design for LEDA includes three, 1. 2 MW, 350 MHz continuous wave (CW), RF systems driving a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) and one, 1. 0 MW, CW, RF system driving a coupled-cavity drift tube linac (CCDTL).

40|$|A 500 kW cw {{klystron}} {{operating at}} 400 MHz {{was developed and}} constructed jointly by CERN and SLAC {{for use as a}} high-power source at CERN for testing LHC/RF components such as <b>circulators,</b> <b>RF</b> absorbers and superconducting cavities with their input couplers. The design is a modification of the 353 MHz SLAC PEP-I klystron. More than 80 % of the original PEP-I tube parts could thus be incorporated in the LHC test klystron which resulted in lower engineering costs as well as reduced development and construction time. The physical length between cathode plane and upper pole plate was kept unchanged so that a PEP-I tube focusing solenoid, available at CERN, could be re-used. With the aid of the klystron simulation codes JPNDISK and CONDOR, the design of the LHC tube was accomplished, which resulted in a tube with noticeably higher efficiency than its predecessor, the PEP-I klystron. The integrated cavities were redesigned using SUPERFISH and the output coupling circuit, which also required redesigning, was done with the aid of MAFIA. Details of the tube development and test results are presented. Figure I: 500 kW, 400 MHz LHC Klystron...|$|R
40|$|A {{ground-based}} C-band scatterometer {{system has}} been constructed at the Faculty of Engineering, Multimedia University, Malaysia. This is a full polarimetric radar operating at 6 Ghz frequency (5 cm wavelength). The scatterometer is targeted for short range operation from 20 to 100 meter. It has the capability to determine complete backscattering matrix of various natural targets over a wide dynamic range (+ 20 dB to - 40 dB). The system operates using frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FM-CW) technique. For short range radar, this is a simpler and more economical hardware design. In general, the system hardware consists of four major sections: an antenna, a radio frequency (RF) subsystem, and intermediate frequency (IF) electronic, and a data acquisition unit (DAU). The antenna is a parabolic reflector with dual-polarised corrugated horn feed. The RF section is constructed in housefrom several RF components, which include a C-band voltage-controlled oscillator, directional coupler, <b>circulator,</b> <b>RF</b> switches, band-pass filter, isolators, and quadrature mixer. In RF section, the received signal is mixed with {{a portion of the}} transmitted signal to produce low frequency IF signals. The IF signals are pre-processed in IF section, before they are digitised in DAU. A microcomputer is used to store the measurement data. In addition, a dedicated computer program has been written to automate the measurement system and to analyse the collected data. Both internal and external calibrations are employed to eliminate short-term and long-term variations in the measurements, respectively. A 100 ns delay line is incorporated in the hardware system for internal calibration. External calibration is accomplished by using the single-target calibration technique (STCT) proposed by Sarabandi and Ulaby (1990). With this technique, only a conducting sphere is needed to fully calibrate the radar for all polarisation combinations. The internal calibration is carried out for every measurement, while the external calibration is conducted only once in a controlled environment before conducting the actual field measurement. In May 1999, a series of controlled experiments has been conducted to evaluate the system performance. The test site is a typical football field. A styrofoam column, which has a dielectric constant close to that of the air, is used to support the test targets. The test targets include a non-depolarised 8 " trihedral corner reflector, and a rotatable 4 " X 8 " dihedral corner reflector. The dihedral is rotated in different angles to provide different sets of polarimetric data. The measurement results show good agreement with the theory. This system will be used to conduct in situ backscatter measurement on earth terrain such as vegetation fields, forest and soil surfaces in the near future...|$|R
