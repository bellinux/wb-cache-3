50|$|Aminosteroids are a {{group of}} steroids with a similar {{structure}} based on an amino-substituted steroid nucleus. They are neuromuscular blocking agents, acting as competitive antagonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), and block the signaling of acetylcholine in the nervous system. These drugs include candocuronium iodide (chandonium iodide), dacuronium bromide, dihydrochandonium, dipyrandium, malouetine, pancuronium bromide, pipecuronium bromide, <b>rapacuronium</b> <b>bromide,</b> rocuronium bromide, stercuronium iodide, and vecuronium bromide.|$|E
40|$|<b>Rapacuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> (rapacuronium; ORG- 9487) is a nondepolarising {{muscle relaxant}} (NMBA) {{with a low}} potency [90 % {{effective}} dose(ED 90) 1 mg/kg], which to some extent is responsible for its rapid onset of action. Because of the: high plasma clearance (5. 3 to 11. 1 mg/kg/min) of rapacuronium, its clinical duration of action following single bolus doses up to 2 mg/kg in adults is short (i. e. 1. 5 mg/kg to facilitate rapid tracheal intubation, and to use succinylcholine or rocuronium rather than rapacuronium in a rapid-sequence setting. Rapacuronium, however, is a suitable alternative to mivacurium chloride (mivacurium) and succinylcholine for short procedures (e. g. ambulatory anaesthesia). Rocuronium bromide (rocuronium) is a relatively low-potent, intermediate-acting NMBA. Its main advantage is the rapid onset of neuromuscular block whereby good or excellent intubating conditions are achieved within 60 to 90 seconds after rocuronium 0. 6 mg/kg (2 x ED 95). and within 60 to 180 seconds after smaller doses (1 to 1. 5 x ED 95). Larger doses of rocuronium (greater {{than or equal to}} 1 mg/kg) seem to be suitable for rapid-sequence induction under relatively light anaesthesia. However, it is still a matter of controversy whether, {{in the case of an}} unanticipated difficult intubation, the long duration of rocuronium administered in such large doses outweighs the many adverse effects of succinylcholine. Rocuronium has mild vagolytic effects and does not release histamine. even when administered in large doses. Rocuronium is primarily eliminated via the liver and its pharmacokinetic profile is similar to that of vecuronium bromide (vecuronium). Unlike vecuronium, rocuronium has no metabolite. Cisatracurium besilate (cisatracurium). the 1 R-cis, 1 'R-cis isomer of atracurium besilate (atracurium) is approximately 4 times more potent than atracurium. The onset time of cisatracurium is significantly slower than after equipotent doses of atracurium. The recommended intubating dose is 0. 15 to 0. 2 mg/kg (3 to 4 times ED 95). Over a wide range of clinically relevant doses the recovery proper ties of cisatracurium are affected by neither the size of the bolus dose nor by the duration of infusion. Unlike atracurium, cisatracurium does not trigger histamine release. Like atracurium. cisatracurium undergoes Hofmann elimination. In contrast to atracurium. cisatracurium does not undergo hydrolysis by nonspecific plasma esterases. Moreover, about 77 % of the drug is cleared by organ-dependent mechanisms...|$|E
