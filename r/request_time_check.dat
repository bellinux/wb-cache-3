50|$|Despite {{the work}} he had done for his team in the Alps, two-time world time trial {{champion}} Fabian Cancellara had the legs to set the first true time to beat, nearly two minutes clear of early leader Sebastian Lang at the intermediate <b>time</b> <b>checks</b> and the finish. Stefan Schumacher, winner of the first time trial in the Tour, exactly tied Cancellara at the first <b>time</b> <b>check</b> and caught Sylwester Szmyd, who started two minutes before him, after only 18 kilometers. He came 14 seconds clear of Cancellara at the third <b>time</b> <b>check</b> and finished 21 seconds better than the world champion at the line.|$|R
50|$|This short {{stage was}} an {{individual}} time trial on an undulating road, departing north-west and uphill from Bourg-Saint-Andéol. The first <b>time</b> <b>check</b> {{took place at}} the 7 km mark at Côte de Bourg-Saint-Andéol. Each rider then headed east through Saint-Remèze, to the second <b>time</b> <b>check</b> at the 20 km mark at Les Arredons. From there, the road took a winding descent to the third <b>time</b> <b>check</b> at the 28 km mark at the Pont d'Arc, with the road then winding north through Vallon-Pont-d'Arc and then uphill east to the finish line at the Caverne du Pont-d'Arc. The route was expected to take each rider around 50 minutes.|$|R

The road then wound uphill west to the second <b>time</b> <b>check</b> at the 10 km mark at Combloux. From there, the riders continued uphill north-west to the third <b>time</b> <b>check</b> at the 13.5 km mark at Les Berthelets. The route then wound north-west to the summit of the Côte des Chozeaux at 1219 m, before a short descent to the finish line in Megève. The route was expected to take each rider around 32 minutes.|$|R

40|$|Participants {{were asked}} to view a film, {{and at the same}} time, to perform a series of interfering actions at the end of several {{successive}} period durations (d). Any delays in executing the required actions were measured, but the main focus was the distribution of <b>time</b> <b>checks</b> over each of the periods. Two small groups, whose mean ages were 22 and 66 years, took part in the study. The overall time-monitoring strategy was found to conform to the following relation: c = 2 exp (t-i) /s, where c was the rank of a <b>time</b> <b>check,</b> and t the total time elapsed thus far. According to this function, after some initial waiting <b>time</b> (i), the <b>checks</b> occurred at gradually narrower <b>time</b> intervals, each <b>check</b> taking place after a constant proportion s/(d-i) of the time left. While most participants in both groups followed this rule, some of them exhibited stronger or weaker forms of the strategy, i. e., forms where the rate of <b>time</b> <b>checking</b> increased either faster or more slowly than the standard function predicts. The weaker forms tended to result in poorer prospective recall performance, but no major {{differences were found between the}} age groups...|$|R

50|$|Denis Menchov and Jens Voigt set nearly {{identical}} times {{about two-thirds of}} the way into the time trial, with Menchov one second better. It stood as best until reigning world time trial champion and stage favorite Fabian Cancellara gained a one-second advantage, despite having been behind Menchov's and Voigt's pace at both intermediate <b>time</b> <b>checks.</b> The surprise of the day came when Stefan Schumacher beat Cancellara by 33 seconds, having similar leads at each <b>time</b> <b>check.</b> Cadel Evans, David Millar, and Kim Kirchen also beat Cancellara, but could not match Schumacher.|$|R

The road then bore north-east to Villamblard and north through Manzac-sur-Vern, before turning north-east again, heading to the second <b>time</b> <b>check</b> on the outskirts of Coursac.
