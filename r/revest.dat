40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{a disturbing}} trend in civil litigation: {{the demise of}} the jury’s historic prerogative to draw inferences from circumstantial evidence. Judges have arrogated to themselves the power to dismiss cases if they find the proffered inferences factually implausible. They have increasingly dismissed cases under the “equal-inference rule” by finding the proffered inferences no more plausible than other available inferences. And they have severely limited the powerful inferences jurors can draw when they conclude that a witness has lied. Commentators have bemoaned the heightened-pleading standard of the 2007 and 2009 U. S. Supreme Court cases, Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, but that heightened standard is only one slice of a larger pattern of power reallocation that has diminished the jury’s role in evaluating circumstantial evidence. The problem is particularly acute in cases involving defendants’ subjective states of mind, where defendants typically have both exclusive control over the direct evidence and a motive to conceal the truth. Instead of testifying live before a diverse group of factfinders, defendants can avoid liability by hiding their demeanor in a paper record submitted only to a judge. This Article proposes a three-tiered solution that would <b>revest</b> juries with inferencedrawing power in state-of-mind cases while simultaneously instilling protections against the perceived costs of jury trials. The proposed solution ensures that state-of-mind cases may always proceed to discovery and trial. But it also allows for fee shifting to dissuade plaintiffs and their attorneys from pursuing weak cases and encourages judges to invoke more frequently their existing power to order retrial of cases in which verdicts appear to be incorrect...|$|E

40|$|Rules in English law {{regarding}} {{transfer of}} rights {{with respect to}} land and movables can generally fit into {{the framework of the}} abstract system. As a default rule throughout English property law, a separate stage of conveyance is necessary to complete the transfer of title, although in cases of unconditional sale of ascertained goods, it is possible to transfer title by the transferor’s intent alone. A study of the Sale of Goods Acts and detinue demonstrates that the contract of sale itself has never been a means of conveyance throughout English legal history. No matter whether a conveyance is made by solo consensu or by additional means, a separate intent to convey remains distinct from the intent to bargain. So long as the conveyance is valid according to its own rules, invalidating factors in the underlying basis of that conveyance in principle do not infect the validity of the conveyance itself. Revesting of title by rescinding the contract of sale induced by fraudulent misrepresentation is an exception, but the underlying rationale in those cases is flawed. From a normative perspective, the alleged ‘unfairness’ to the transferor under extreme circumstances is not self-evident. Arguments such as ‘initial impaired consent subtraction’ or ‘assumption of insolvency risk plus swollen assets’ might serve as possible ways to determine such ‘unfairness’. Nonetheless, these arguments remain problematic if employed to justify the need for causality. A unique characteristic of English law is that in certain impaired consent transfer cases, although title transferred cannot <b>revest</b> at law, equity may grant a right under a constructive trust with numerous proprietary attributes. However, this is nevertheless consistent with the operation of the English abstract system, for such an equitable interest acquired by the transferor, unlike what he could acquire under a causal system, is by its nature not a right in rem. With these observations, English law could provide at least three lessons for the ongoing debate in Chinese academia about whether Chinese law should adopt the principles of separation and abstraction. This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|E
