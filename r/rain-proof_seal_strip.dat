40|$|The {{effects of}} load factor and rotor {{eccentricity}} were determined on flow conditions in test series for two stages. The {{results indicate that}} swirl-type entry flow follows the rules of potential swirl. Within the labyrinth cavities two spatial separated flow areas are considered. A dominating flow in periphera direction nearly fills {{the space between the}} <b>sealing</b> <b>strips</b> and the ceiling of the cavity. Below this flow, an area of axial mass transport is situated, with a slight peripheral component, limited on the nearest surroundings of the seals gap and the rotor surface. Between both flows, an exchange of energy takes place. Within the gaps, flow direction depends on axial velocity and therefore on variable flow contraction. A balance of energy within the seal and the cavities interprets the results of lateral force measurements as an influence of friction at the <b>sealing</b> <b>strips</b> surface and the rotating shaft surface.

40|$|In this project, Stora Enso’s newly {{developed}} building {{system has been}} further developed to allow building to the Swedish passive house standard for the Swedish climate. The building system {{is based on a}} building framework of CLT (Cross laminated timber) boards. The concept has been tested on a small test building. The experience gained from this test building has also been used for planning a larger building (two storeys with the option of a third storey) with passive house standard with this building system. The main conclusions from the project are:  It is possible to build airtight buildings with this technique without using traditional vapour barriers. Initial measurements show that this can be done without reaching critical humidity levels in the walls and roof, at least where wood fibre insulation is used, as this has a greater capacity for storing and evening out the moisture than mineral wool. However, the test building has so far not been exposed to internal generation of moisture (added moisture from showers, food preparation etc.). This needs to be investigated and this will be done during the winter 2013 - 14.  A new fixing method for doors and windows has been tested without traditional fibre filling between them and the CLT panel. The door or window is pressed directly on to the CLT panel instead, with an expandable <b>sealing</b> <b>strip</b> between them. This has been proved to be successful.  The air tightness between the CLT panels is achieved with expandable <b>sealing</b> <b>strips</b> between the panels. The position of the <b>sealing</b> <b>strips</b> is important, both for the air tightness itself and to allow rational assembly.  Recurrent air tightness measurements show that the air tightness decreased somewhat during the first six months, but not {{to such an extent that}} the passive house criteria were not fulfilled. The reason for the decreased air tightness is not clear, but can be due to small movements in the CLT construction and also to the <b>sealing</b> <b>strips</b> being affected by changing outdoor temperatures.  Long term measurements (at least two years) have to be carried out before more reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding the long term effect of the construction on air tightness and humidity in the walls.  An economic analysis comparing using a concrete frame or the studied CLT frame for a three storey building shows that it is probably more expensive to build with CLT. For buildings higher than three floors, the CLT frame has economic advantages, mainly because of the shorter building time compared to using concrete for the frame. In this analysis, no considerations have been taken to differences in the influence on the environment or the global climate between the two construction methods...|$|R

In a relatively large number of bridges, <b>strip</b> <b>seals</b> have pulled out of the steel extrusions or otherwise failed well before the expected life span of the seal. The most serious consequence of a <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> failure is damage to the bridge substructure due to salt, water, and debris interacting with the substructure.

40|$|<b>Strip</b> <b>seals</b> {{are used}} in gas turbine engines between two static {{elements}} or between components which do not move relative to each other, such as Nozzle Guide Vanes (NGVs). The key role of a <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> between NGV segments is sealing between the flow through the main stream annulus and the internal air system and to limit inter-segmental movements. In general {{the shape of the}} <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> is a rectangular strip that fits into two slots in adjacent components. The minimum clearance required for static <b>strip</b> <b>seals</b> must be found by accounting for thermal expansion, misalignment, and application, to allow correct fitment of the <b>strip</b> <b>seals.</b> Any increase in leakage raises the cost due to an increase in the cooling air use, which is linked to specific fuel consumption, and it can also alter gas flow paths and performance. The narrow path within the seal assembly, especially the height has the most significant affect on leakage. The height range of the narrow path studied in this paper is 0. 01 0. 06 mm. The behaviour of the flow passing through the narrow path has been studied using CFD modelling and measurements in a bespoke rig. The CFD and experimental results show that normalized leakage flow increases with pressure ratio before reaching a maximum. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} provide new experimental data to verify the CFD modelling for static <b>strip</b> <b>seals.</b> The typical flow characteristics validated by CFD modelling and experiments can be used to predict the flow behaviour for future static <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> designs...|$|R

40|$|Bridge {{expansion}} joints, if {{not properly}} designed, constructed, and maintained, {{often lead to}} the deterioration of critical substructure elements. <b>Strip</b> <b>seal</b> expansion joints consisting of a steel extrusion and neoprene gland are one type of expansion joint and are commonly used by the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT). <b>Strip</b> <b>seal</b> expansion joints are susceptible to tears and pull outs that allow water, chlorides, and debris to infiltrate the joint, and subsequently the bearings below. One area of the <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> that is particularly problematic is where it terminates at the interface between the deck and the barrier rail. The Iowa DOT has noted that the initial construction quality of the current <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> termination detail is not satisfactory, nor ideal, and a need exists for re-evaluation and possibly re-design of this detail. Desirable qualities of a <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> termination detail provide a seal that is simple and fast to construct, facilitate quick gland removal and installation, and provide a reliable, durable barrier to prevent chloride-contaminated water from reaching the substructure. To meet the objectives of this research project, several <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> termination details were evaluated in the laboratory. Alternate termination details may not only function better than the current Iowa DOT standard, but are also less complicated to construct, facilitating better quality control.

30|$|The proper {{assembly}} of underground precast concrete structures is often {{critical in the}} construction of underground structures. In particular, interfacial waterproofing between precast concrete segments is a key factor influencing use, safety, and life span. Current practice is to incorporate waterproofing rubber strips in the design. During the installation process, compressive stress is applied to the strip by post-tensioning to achieve performance. For this paper, lateral constraint compression tests were carried out on composite rubber <b>seal</b> <b>strips</b> that utilize putty. Special waterproofing and sealing test devices were designed to investigate corresponding relationships between water pressure and compressive stress (or strain). A relationship between water resistance pressure and compression stress and strain of the putty-based composite rubber strip was proposed based on the series tests and the control target of the minimum compression strain of the putty composite rubber strip was then suggested. Finally, full-scale waterproofing tests on tunnel joints were conducted. The experimental results provide a scientific reference for the engineering application and design of composite <b>sealing</b> rubber <b>strips</b> putty for underground post-tensioned precast concrete structures.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{processes}} involved in and consequences of sub-zero temperatures on the soil parameters relevant to landfill liners. The main points discussed in this paper are examination of published investigations and theories, determination of the changing material properties by in-situ laboratory experiments, experimental determination of temperature loads in-situ and of influences of real boundary conditions in laboratory tests and possible thermal protection methods. In general a structure will be formed in the material which is characteristic of the matrix of the material and the main influence parameters. The results are a rising moisture content in the frozen zone (in case of cryosuction), a lower dry density (loosening by ice lenses) and normally a lower shear capacity. The permeability measured in a triaxcell of the thawed material is raised within the factor of five - in extreme cases within the factor of ten. On the whole the changes measured in-situ are smaller than those measured in the laboratory. The changes are partly reversible by loading, but the structure created by frost will remain latent. One of the essential influences on soil parameters and reversibility {{is represented by the}} mineralogy of the material. Frost penetration in the clay liner below a drain layer of about 40 cm (gavel d = 16 / 32) could not be measured during two winter periods with normal to light weather conditions. Following a frost penetration, landfill liners covered with a plastic <b>sealing</b> <b>strip</b> alone or a plastic <b>sealing</b> <b>strip</b> and a geotextile showed only slight changes in dry density and moisture content. Changes in permeability were even less marked. For uncovered landfill liners alternating cycles of rain, frost and drying resulted in noticeable changes in dry density, moisture content and soil structure. In conclusion {{it can be said that}} this paper discusses some materials with regard to their suitability as a thermal protection for landfill mineral liners. In addition, a flow chart for work on frost-related problems within compacted-clay landfill liners is proposed. (orig.)

40|$|Within the {{reported}} work {{the applicability of}} the time-dependent plate-loading test for determinating the effectivity of protective layers for plastic <b>sealing</b> <b>strips</b> was evaluated. A series of experiments were carried out to ascertain how reproducible the results are and to determine the sensitivity of the method for differentiating the effect of various protective layers. An objective assessment was made possible by using a specially devised scanning-and interpretation method. In theory and practice it was demonstated that the employment of computer-controlled scanning- and evaluation methods is suitable for a reliable assessment of the samples. The deviation caused by these methods were much lower than those caused by the recommended use of manual measurements. The series of experiments show that a single trial of the time-dependent plate-loading test is not sufficient for an exact assessment of a protective layer. However, an extensive survey of the deformation and evaluation of several trials serve to recognize qualitative and quantitative differences in the effect of different protective layers.
