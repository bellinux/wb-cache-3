40|$|The {{families}} of smooth <b>rational</b> <b>surfaces</b> in ^ 4 have been classified in degree < 10. All known <b>rational</b> <b>surfaces</b> in ^ 4 {{can be represented}} as blow-ups of the plane ^ 2. The fine classification of these surfaces consists of giving explicit open and closed conditions which determine the configurations of points corresponding to all surfaces in a given family. Using a restriction argument originally due independently to Alexander and Bauer we achieve the fine classification in two cases, namely non-special <b>rational</b> <b>surfaces</b> of degree 9 and special <b>rational</b> <b>surfaces</b> of degree 8. The first case completes the fine classification of all non-special <b>rational</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In the second case we obtain {{a description of the}} moduli space as the quotient of a rational variety by the symmetric group S_ 5.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} based on lectures given at the Clay Summer School on Arithmetic Geometry in July 2006. These notes offer an {{introduction}} to the birational geometry of algebraic sur-faces, emphasizing the aspects useful for arithmetic. The first three sections are explicitly devoted to birational questions, with a special focus on <b>rational</b> <b>surfaces.</b> We explain the special rôle these play in the larger classification theory. The ge-ometry of <b>rational</b> ruled <b>surfaces</b> and Del Pezzo surfaces is studied in substantial detail. We extend this theory to geometrically <b>rational</b> <b>surfaces</b> over non-closed fields, enumerating the minimal surfaces and describing their geometric properties. This gives essentially the complete classification of <b>rational</b> <b>surfaces</b> up to birational equivalence. The final two sections focus on singular Del Pezzo surfaces, universal torsors, and their algebraic realizations through Cox rings. Current techniques for count-ing rational points (on <b>rational</b> <b>surfaces</b> over number fields) often work better for singular surfaces than for smooth surfaces.

The construction, based on Beauvilles’s general idea, is considerably simplified {{by the fact that}} all examples are described by hyperelliptic curves and Jacobians. This also enables to compare these integrable systems with more classical integrable systems, such as the Neumann system and the periodic Toda chain, which are also associated with <b>rational</b> <b>surfaces.</b> A delicate difference between the cases of K 3 and of <b>rational</b> <b>surfaces</b> is pointed out therein.
