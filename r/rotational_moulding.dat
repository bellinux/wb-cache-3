The main reason being that South Africa {{does not have}} enough very large size CNC machines on which these could be machined. A large size mould half can be split into two or more smaller parts for machining purposes and then reassembled later. In this way many large size <b>moulds,</b> especially <b>rotational</b> <b>moulds</b> can be manufactured on medium size CNC machines. Since the large component has been split into small parts, these can be distributed to different subcontractors to machine simultaneously, and thereby reducing the total manufacturing lead-time. The project then uses three case studies to advance the proposed concept for mould manufacture. A small size <b>rotational</b> <b>mould</b> for a model drum is manufactured to confirm that Pentech had both the infrastructure and required skill to make a <b>rotational</b> <b>mould</b> of any sort. Then a medium size <b>rotational</b> <b>mould</b> of a steering wheel is manufactured. This case study is the key and longest stage in this project; it consists of the full process of mould subdivision followed by full mould manufacture, some subcontracting of parts and lastly full product testing. Finally, a part of a large size mould was manufactured for purpose of investigating all aspects around the subcontracting ofmould parts. In the first case study the clamping strategy used through out {{as an integral part of}} the subdivision strategy is proven. The second case study using the medium size <b>rotational</b> <b>mould</b> successfully demonstrates the subdivision concept, along with its material savings. This second case study also introduces the idea of including CNC lathe parts.

50|$|<b>Rotational</b> Molding (BrE <b>moulding)</b> {{involves}} a heated hollow mold which {{is filled with}} a charge or shot weight of material.

The aim of this research project was to develop a <b>rotational</b> <b>moulding</b> material which possessed substantially improved mechanical properties over conventional, rotationally moulded polyethylene grades. This was attempted through the development of a fibre-reinforced thermoplastic composite which was amenable to the <b>rotational</b> <b>moulding</b> process. Although the development of rotationally moulded composites has been previously reported in literature, these materials have largely proven to be unsatisfactory in terms of mechanical performance.

40|$|Hollow {{plastic parts}} {{can be made}} by a number of {{manufacturing}} methods, but only <b>rotational</b> <b>moulding</b> offers the ability to create one-piece, stress-free parts with attractive economics. However, the fundamental nature of <b>rotational</b> <b>moulding</b> is such that cycle times are long. Consequently, the plastic is subjected to relatively high temperatures, in the presence of air, for excessive periods of time. This can lead to thermal and oxidative degradation at the inner free surface of the plastic, resulting in a deterioration in the performance of the moulded part. The industry relies heavily on the experience of operators to establish the best processing conditions to avoid degradation, but this is problematic and inefficient. Unfortunately, automatic process control is difficult owing to the complex rotation of the mould. Recent developments highlighting the importance of the peak air temperature inside the mould have been an important step forward, but ever-increasing technical demands on moulders make it clear that more sophisticated process control is needed. It is known that the processing conditions that lead to degradation vary with factors that affect the heating rate, such as the type of mould used and the thickness of the end-product.

In this research, oil palm empty fruit bunch fibre reinforced polyethylene (EFB-PE) composites which is using high density polyethylene (HDPE) have been produced using a <b>rotational</b> <b>moulding</b> as the compounding equipment. Three levels of EFB were employed; 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 % of the total weight of the sample.

Overall, both coupling agents imparted considerable improvement in the impact strength and tensile modulus, MaPE showed the highest enhancement.

The effect of different fiber length size (75 - 150, 150 - 250, 250 - 400 ~m) was also investigated; the result showed that all mechanical properties decreased with increasing filler loading.
