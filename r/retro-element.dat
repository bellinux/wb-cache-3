40|$|Natural {{selective}} processes {{have been}} known to drive phenotypic plasticity, which is the emergence of different phenotypes from one genome following environmental stimulation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been observed to modulate transcriptional and epigenetic states of genes in human cells. We surmised that lncRNAs are governors of phenotypic plasticity and drive natural selective processes through epigenetic modulation of gene expression. Using heat shocked human cells as a model we find several differentially expressed transcripts with the top candidates being lncRNAs derived from retro-elements. One particular <b>retro-element</b> derived transcripts, Retro-EIF 2 S 2, was found to be abundantly over-expressed in heat shocked cells. Over-expression of Retro-EIF 2 S 2 significantly enhanced cell viability and modulated a predisposition for an adherent cellular phenotype upon heat shock. Mechanistically, we find that this <b>retro-element</b> derived transcript interacts directly with a network of proteins including 40 S ribosomal protein S 30 (FAU), Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 A (EIF 5 A), and Ubiquitin- 60 S ribosomal protein L 40 (UBA 52) to affect protein modulated cell adhesion pathways. We find one motif in Retro-EIF 2 S 2 that exhibits binding to FAU and modulates phenotypic cell transitions from adherent to suspension states. The observations presented here suggest that retroviral derived transcripts actively modulate phenotypic plasticity in human cells in response to environmental selective pressures and suggest that natural selection may play out through the action of retro-elements in human cells...|$|E
40|$|The multi-copy {{single-stranded}} DNA (msDNA) is yielded by {{the action}} of reverse transcriptase of <b>retro-element</b> {{in a wide range of}} pathogenic bacteria. Upon this phenomenon, it has been shown that msDNA is only produced by Eubacteria because many Eubacteria species contained reverse transcriptase in their special <b>retro-element.</b> We have screened around 111 Archaea at KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database available at genome net server and observed three Methanosarcina species (M. acetivorans, M. barkeri and M. mazei), which also contained reverse transcriptase in their genome sequences. This observation of reverse transcriptase in Archaea raises questions regarding the origin of this enzyme. The evolutionary relationship between these two domains of life (Eubacteria and Archaea) hinges upon the phenomenon of retrons. Interestingly, the evolutionary trees based on the reverse transcriptases (RTs) and 16 S ribosomal RNAs point out that all the Eubacteria RTs were descended from Archaea RTs during their evolutionary times. In addition, we also have shown some significant structural features among the newly identified msDNA-Yf 79 in Yersinia frederiksenii with other of its related msDNAs (msDNA-St 85, msDNA-Vc 95, msDNA-Vp 96, msDNA-Ec 78 and msDNA-Ec 83) from pathogenic bacteria. Together the degree of sequence conservation among these msDNAs, the evolutionary trees and the distribution of these ret (reverse transcriptase) genes suggest a possible evolutionary scenario. The single common ancestor of the organisms of Eubacteria and Archaea subgroups probably achieved this ret gene during their evolution through the vertical descent rather than the horizontal transformations followed by integration into this organism genome by a mechanism related to phage recognition and/or transposition...|$|E
40|$|The {{complete}} {{nucleotide sequence}} {{of a mouse}} <b>retro-element</b> is presented. The cloned element is composed of 4, 834 base pairs (bp) with long terminal repeats of 568 bp separated by an internal region of 3, 698 bp. The element {{did not appear to}} have any open reading frames that would be capable of encoding the functional proteins that are normally produced by retro-elements. However, some regions of the genome showed some homology to retroviral gag and pol open reading frames. There was no region in VL 30 corresponding to a retroviral env gene. This implies that VL 30 is related to retrotransposons rather than to retroviruses. The sequence also contained regions that were homologous to known reverse transcriptase priming sites and viral packaging sites. These observations, combined with the known transcriptional capacity of the VL 30 promoter, suggest that VL 30 relies on protein functions of other retro-elements, such as murine leukemia virus, while maintaining highly conserved cis-active promoter, packaging, and priming sites necessary for its replication and cell-to-cell transmission...|$|E

These <b>retro-elements</b> exist in the cotton genome in high copy number, and their encoded transcripts were detected. Phylogenetic analysis shows that these <b>retro-elements</b> are heterogeneous and closely related to elements present in other plant species.

50|$|There are two {{proposals}} for how HERVs became fixed {{in the human}} genome. The first assumes that sometime during human evolution, exogenous progenitors of HERV inserted themselves into germ line cells and then replicated along with the host's genes using and exploiting the host's cellular mechanisms. Because of their distinct genomic structure, HERVs were subjected to many rounds of amplification and transposition, which lead to a widespread distribution of retroviral DNA. The second hypothesis claims the continuous evolution of <b>retro-elements</b> from more simple structured ancestors.|$|R

Statistical methods {{that were used to}} identify chromatin features that predict exogenous gamma-retrovirus integration site selection were exploited here to determine whether cell type-specific chromatin markers are enriched in the vicinity of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). RESULTS: Among <b>retro-elements</b> in the human genome, the gamma-retrovirus HERV-H was highly associated with H 3 K 4 me 3, though this association was only observed in embryonic stem (ES) cells (p 3 ̆c 10 - 300) and, to a lesser extent, in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. No significant association was observed in nearly 40 differentiated cell types, nor was any association observed with other <b>retro-elements.</b> Similar strong association was observed between HERV-H and the binding sites within ES cells for the pluripotency transcription factors NANOG, OCT 4, and SOX 2. NANOG binding sites were located within the HERV-H 52 ̆ 7 LTR itself. OCT 4 and SOX 2 binding sites were within 1 kB and 2 kB of the 52 ̆ 7 LTR, respectively.

40|$|The {{application}} of a new gene-based strategy for sequencing the wheat mitochondrial genome shows its structure to be a 452 [*] 528 bp circular molecule, and provides nucleotide-level evidence of intra-molecular recombination. Single, reciprocal and double recombinant products, and the nucleotide sequences of the repeats that mediate their formation have been identified. The genome has 55 genes with exons, including 35 protein-coding, 3 rRNA and 17 tRNA genes. Nucleotide sequences of seven wheat genes have been determined {{here for the first}} time. Nine genes have an exon–intron structure. Gene amplification responsible for the production of multicopy mitochondrial genes, in general, is species-specific, suggesting the recent origin of these genes. About 16, 17, 15, 3. 0 and 0. 2 % of wheat mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) may be of genic (including introns), open reading frame, repetitive sequence, chloroplast and <b>retro-element</b> origin, respectively. The gene order of the wheat mitochondrial gene map shows little synteny to the rice and maize maps, indicative that thorough gene shuffling occurred during speciation. Almost all unique mtDNA sequences of wheat, as compared with rice and maize mtDNAs, are redundant DNA. Features of the gene-based strategy are discussed, and a mechanistic model of mitochondrial gene amplification is proposed...|$|E

The LTRs of CARE 1 show 93. 9 % nucleotide identity {{to each other and}} have 4 -bp (ACTA) terminal inverted repeats. A 17 -bp potential tRNAmet primer binding site downstream to 5 &#x 27; LTR and a 13 -bp polypurine tract upstream to 3 &#x 27; LTR have been identified. The order of domains (Gag-proteinase-reverse transcriptase-RNaseH-integrase) in the deduced amino acid sequence and phylogenetic tree constructed using reverse transcriptase sequences places CARE 1 in the gypsy group of retrotransposons.

Two {{located on the}} homeologous chromosomes A 2 and C 2 arose from a lineage distinct from four located on A 7 and C 6. A set of three conserved blocks A, B and C, which {{were found to be}} essential for FT activation by CONSTANS (CO) in Arabidopsis, was identified within the FT upstream region in B. napus and its progenitor diploids. However, on chromosome C 2, insertion of a DNA transposable element (TE) and a <b>retro-element</b> in FT upstream blocks A and B contributed to significant structural divergence between the A and C genome orthologues. Phylogenetic analysis of upstream block A indicated the conserved evolutionary relationships of distinct FT genes within Brassicaceae. We conclude that the ancient At-a whole genome duplication contributed to distinct ancestral lineages for this key adaptive gene, which co-exist within the same genus. FT-A 2 was found to be transcribed in all leaf samples from different developmental stages in both B. rapa and B. napus, whereas FT-C 2 was not transcribed in either B. napus or B. oleracea. Silencing of FT-C 2 appeared to result from TE insertion and consequent high levels of cytosine methylation in TE sequences within upstream block A. Interestingly, FT-A 7 /C 6 paralogues were specifically silenced in winter type B. napus but abundantly expressed in spring type cultivars under vernalization-free conditions.

The six nucleotides immediately downstream of the stop codon conform to a degenerate nucleotide motif, CARYYA, which is sufficient to facilitate stop codon suppression in tobacco mosaic virus. In vivo stop codon suppression assays indicate that SIRE 1 sequences confer leakiness to the UAG stop codon at an efficiency of 5 %.

40|$|In {{dissecting}} {{the molecules}} and molecular mechanisms that control mammalian oocyte-to-embryo transition, we found abundant transcripts representing developmentally regulated ERVs (endogenous retroviruses) in mouse oocyte and two-cell stage embryo cDNA libraries.

Heritable genetic change due to replication of these retrotransposons probably occurs specifically in oocytes and early embryos.

40|$|Barley (Hordeum vulgare) {{ranks as}} the world’s fourth major cereal crop after maize, wheat and rice, {{both in terms of}} {{quantity}} produced and in area of cultivation. It has received considerable research attention as a model for genetic analyses, and breeding programs globally are working towards improved varieties with better quality, disease-resistance and agronomic traits. Like many other food staples, the use of transgenic technology has become an important tool available for modern barley improvement programs. However, transformation technology relies upon in vitro plant tissue culture, which has been proven to generate spontaneous and heritable genetic changes termed somaclonal variation (SCV). To be of practical value, genetic engineering techniques should produce genetically elite plants with one or more novel characteristics. Extensive SCV can result in many undesirable changes in the genetic background of transgenic plants, affecting their potential as cultivars or elite parents. Many factors have been described as potentially responsible for SCV, and generally most can be classified as stress factors. Tissue culture-induced mobilisation of transposable-elements (TEs) is one cause of SCV based on the knowledge that TEs can be responsible for generating significant genomic change and are one of the driving forces of evolution. To elucidate the extent of TE participation in SCV, barley was chosen as a genetic model because of its importance and its well characterised genome. <b>Retro-element</b> BARE- 1 (for barley retroelement 1) is part of an active family of copia-like retroelements, dispersed on all chromosomes. Hence, BARE- 1 {{has been used as a}} case study in understanding the role of retro-elements in barley SCV. A retrotransposon-based marker system, inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP), and inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) were used to detect SCV induced by tissue culture. It was proposed that a greater frequency of polymorphisms emanating from the IRAP marker system in comparison to the ISSR marker system, would suggest that activation and transposition of BARE- 1 elements, and thus retrotransposon activity, were making a significant contribution to the extent of SCV. However, there was no significant difference in the frequency of novel, non-parental bands. Cluster analysis also revealed that the level of polymorphism and genetic variability detected was comparable between IRAP and ISSR markers. The effect of transformation protocols on BARE- 1 expression levels was then assessed. Treatments included osmoticum, bialaphos, kanamycin, hygromycin and cefotaxime. Anti-retroviral compounds were applied to tissue culture media to evaluate the effectiveness of reducing BARE- 1 expression and, indirectly, SCV. It was observed that hygromycin B, osmoticum and cefotaxime had the greatest impact on BARE- 1 up-regulation, with kanamycin and bialaphos having a low, observable impact on retrotransposon activity. The response of barley to anti-retroviral drug compounds differed according to the class of drug applied and the gene evaluated. A marked reduction in BARE- 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) expression was observed in ‘Mackay’ explants treated with the nucleoside analog, reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), Zidovudine, over a period of hours. However, over a period of weeks, no discernible down-regulation of BARE- 1 RT was observed and some treatments actually showed up-regulation. A transgenic approach using RNAi methodologies to silence a conserved domain of the BARE- 1 RT and, indirectly, BARE- 1 transposition was explored. All T 0 lines tested positive for transgene sequences using PCR, but only 4 plants were according to Southern blot hybridisation. Relative expression of BARE- 1 RT in T 2 generation lines showed up-regulation compared to non-transgenic controls, possibly as a result of the inadvertent detection of the hairpin construct. Further investigation is required to evaluate if it is possible to down regulate or knockout BARE- 1 RT and assess the level of SCV amongst transgenic progeny. Such experiments would be highly valuable in elucidating the biology of retrotransposons in cereals. Integration of IRAP markers, derived from a barley recombinant inbred (RI) line population, into a high density genetic consensus map and evaluation of their potential to be used for basic and applied genetic diversity analyses and marker-assisted selection programs was assessed. IRAP markers were shown to be distributed over all chromosomes, and significant associations with phenotypic QTLs for quality, agronomic and disease traits were found. Further evidence supporting retrotransposon activity is a substantial component of SCV was provided through the comparison between ISSR and IRAP markers to indicate the degree of genomic instability in barley explants as well as through the quantification of the BARE- 1 retrotransposon family and its response to different stress inducing treatments sourced from transformation protocols. Assessment of BARE- 1 activity response to anti-retroviral drug compounds provided some evidence of the efficacy of the compounds to reduce BARE- 1 RT expression. As stated above, further work is required to conclusively demonstrate their capacity to reduce retrotransposon proliferation during tissue culture, as certain anti-retroviral compounds actually exacerbated BARE- 1 expression above controls. Pursuit of such an intervention seems likely to be complicated by the complex interaction between retro-elements and their hosts combined with the multifarious cellular environment...|$|E

40|$|A {{large portion}} of the {{mammalian}} genome is derived from ancient transposable elements. Retroelements, transported by an intracellular copy-and-paste process involving an RNA intermediate (retrotransposition), constitute a majority of these mobile genetic elements. Endogenous retroviruses are LTR-type retroelements accounting for around 8 % of human or murine genomic DNA. Non-LTR members are present in extremely high copy numbers; with LINE- 1 contributing to nearly 40 % of human and murine genomes. These LINE- 1 elements modify mammalian genomes not only through insertions, but also by indirect replication of nonautonomous retrotransposons such as SINEs. As expected, cellular machineries of vertebrate's innate immunity have evolved to support a balance between retroelement insertions that cause deleterious gene disruptions and those that confer beneficial genetic diversity. The ability of APOBEC 3 cytidine deaminases targeting DNA to restrict a broad number of retroviruses and <b>retro-elements</b> is now well established. More recently, the RNA editing family member APOBEC 1, a protein involved in lipid transport, has also been shown to be involved in keeping mobile elements under control.

This commentary pres-ents two recent papers, which document significant changes in transcriptional activity of retroelements in two different model systems, salamander limb regen-eration and regeneration of radial organs in the sea cucumber Holothuria glaber-rima. We hypothesize that transcrip-tional activity of the retrotransposons can be specifically controlled by the host and may play some hitherto unrecog-nized role in regeneration. Regeneration represents a unique biologi-cal phenomenon of re-initiation of devel-opmental processes in animals in response to various kinds of traumatic injuries. The ability to regrow injured body parts is widely, but unevenly represented in the animal kingdom. Therefore, regenerative biology, as a field, has benefited from stud-ies on animals, such as salamanders, echi-noderms, planarians and coelenterates, that show amazing feats of regeneration not commonly found in classical animal models such as mice, Drosophila or C. elegans. Understanding gene regulatory mechanisms driving post-traumatic tissue re-growth in these regeneration-compe-tent animals is important for two reasons. First, on a theoretical level, it contributes to our knowledge of fundamental prin-ciples of regeneration as a developmental phenomenon, its evolution and relation-ships with embryogenesis. A related, but more practical reason, is that the research Retrotransposons in animal regeneration Overlooked components of the regenerative machinery...|$|R

Decoding upland cotton genomes will undoubtedly provide the ultimate reference and resource for structural, functional, and evolutionary studies of the species. Here, we employed GeneTrek and BAC tagging information approaches to predict the general composition {{and structure of the}} allotetraploid cotton genome. Results 142 BAC sequences from Gossypium hirsutum cv. Maxxa were downloaded [URL] and confirmed. These BAC sequence analysis revealed that the tetraploid cotton genome contains over 70, 000 candidate genes with duplicated gene copies in homoeologous A- and D-subgenome regions. Gene distribution is uneven, with gene-rich and gene-free regions of the genome. Twenty-one percent of the 142 BACs lacked genes. BAC gene density ranged from 0 to 33. 2 per 100 kb, whereas most gene islands contained only one gene with an average of 1. 5 genes per island. <b>Retro-elements</b> were found to be a major component, first an enriched LTR/gypsy and second LTR/copia. Most LTR retrotransposons were truncated and in nested structures. In addition, 166 polymorphic loci amplified with SSRs developed from 70 BAC clones were tagged on our backbone genetic map. Seventy-five percent (125 / 166) of the polymorphic loci were tagged on the D-subgenome. By comprehensively analyzing the molecular size of amplified products among tetraploid G. hirsutum cv. Maxxa, acc. TM- 1, and G. barbadense cv. Hai 7124, and diploid G. herbaceum var. africanum and G. raimondii, 37 BACs, 12 from the A- and 25 from the D-subgenome, were further anchored to their corresponding subgenome chromosomes. After a large amount of genes sequence comparison from different subgenome BACs, the result showed that introns might have no contribution to different subgenome size in Gossypium.

40|$|Cytosolic double {{stranded}} DNA (dsDNA) is sensed as a “danger signal” by host cells. Detection of viral and bacterial {{nucleic acid}} {{is emerging as}} a major route for cells to identify an infection by a pathogen. Recognition of cytoplasmic DNA causes death of some cells and interferon (IFN) and cytokine induction, which are appropriate anti-viral responses. Responses to cytoplasmic DNA may not only be relevant to certain retrovirus, DNA virus and bacterial infections, but could also be generated by reverse transcription of endogenous <b>retro-elements.</b> Introduction of DNA into the cytoplasm of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMM) causes upregulation of MHC Class I, induction of IFNβ and other cytokines and cell death. Both cytokine induction and cell death were independent of recognition of “CpG motifs” through TLR 9. In order {{to determine whether a}} single receptor was likely to mediate these responses, the types of DNA eliciting these responses was compared. Both cellular activation to produce cytokines and IFNβ, as well as cell death were seen only with dsDNA but not single stranded DNA (ssDNA). Both responses increased with increasing DNA length, with little detectable effect of a double stranded 22 bp oligonucleotide (ODN). The sequences of DNA leading to optimal induction of IFNβ and death were different. Although all dsDNA induced death of primary macrophages, poly(dA) :(dT) was a particularly potent and rapid pro-death stimulus. In contrast, poly(dA) :(dT) was a relatively poor stimulus for IFNβ, even at doses which were minimally toxic, or in cells which are resistant to DNA induced cell death. The alternating co-polymer poly(dA-dT) was the most potent inducer of IFNβ. This data suggests that separate DNA receptors mediate cell death and IFNβ induction in response to dsDNA Transfected dsDNA also rapidly activated caspase 3, a classical pro-apoptotic caspase, in BMM as early as 2 ½ minutes post-transfection with DNA. Caspase 3 is an effector caspase which is activated by an upstream initiator caspase. Although the apical caspase in the DNA detection system has not been defined, use of Bcl 2 overexpressing BMM and caspase 2 -/- BMM showed that DNA-dependent caspase 3 activation did not occur via the mitochondrial damage or the caspase 2 activation pathways. The inflammatory caspase, caspase 1 was also activated in response to DNA transfection, although whether caspase 1 is responsible for cleavage of caspase 3 has not been established. Caspase 1 activation suggests the involvement of the inflammasome, which is important for processing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL- 1 β into their biologically active forms. Furthermore, there is recent evidence suggesting that DNA-transfected cells die by a caspase 1 -dependent cell death called pyroptosis. Other work in our lab identified the HIN- 200 family member and candidate lupus susceptibility factor p 202 as a candidate receptor for cytoplasmic dsDNA; p 202 bound stably and rapidly to transfected DNA. Here, knockdown studies revealed p 202 to be a regulatory protein limiting DNA-induced caspase 1 and 3 activation. Conversely, the related pyrin domain-containing HIN- 200 factor AIM 2 (p 210), a candidate tumour suppressor, was required for caspase 1 and 3 activation by cytoplasmic dsDNA. Recently published work suggests that AIM 2 multimerises {{along the length of the}} DNA leading to the formation of an inflammasome complex. The pyrin domain of AIM 2 recruits the adaptor protein ASC through homotypic pyrin domain interactions. ASC subsequently recruits caspase 1, which results in its auto-activation. The inhibitory effect of p 202 on caspase activation is likely to be due to its lack of a pyrin signalling domain. p 202 rapidly binds to cytoplasmic DNA, and may reduce the clustering of AIM 2 pyrin domains which results in caspase activation. Consistent with this proposal, DNA-dependent caspase activation correlated inversely with p 202 expresssion in 3 mouse strains. This work defines HIN- 200 proteins as a new class of pattern recognition receptors mediating responses to dsDNA. Work in this thesis aimed to understand the biological role and mechanism of responses to cytoplasmic DNA. Responses to cytoplasmic DNA are likely to be relevant not only to infectious disease but also to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythmatosus (SLE), where DNA appears to act as an adjuvant, and even tumour progression where there is evidence for a role for active endogenous <b>retro-elements.</b> In addition, responses to DNA may limit transfection efficiency and the efficacy of non-viral gene therapy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Manduca sexta, Heliothis virescens, and Heliconius erato {{represent}} three widely-used insect model {{species for}} genomic and fundamental studies in Lepidoptera. Large-insert BAC libraries of these insects are critical resources for many molecular studies, including physical mapping and genome sequencing, but {{not available to}} date. Results We report the construction and characterization of six large-insert BAC libraries for the three species and sampling sequence analysis of the genomes. The six BAC libraries were constructed with two restriction enzymes, two libraries for each species, and each has an average clone insert size ranging from 152 – 175 kb. We estimated that the genome coverage of each library ranged from 6 – 9 ×, with the two combined libraries of each species being equivalent to 13. 0 – 16. 3 × haploid genomes. The genome coverage, quality and utility of the libraries were further confirmed by library screening using 6 ~ 8 putative single-copy probes. To provide a first glimpse into these genomes, we sequenced and analyzed the BAC ends of ~ 200 clones randomly selected from the libraries of each species. The data revealed that the genomes are AT-rich, contain relatively small fractions of repeat elements with a majority belonging to the category of low complexity repeats, and are more abundant in <b>retro-elements</b> than DNA transposons. Among the species, the H. erato genome is somewhat more abundant in repeat elements and simple repeats than those of M. sexta and H. virescens. The BLAST analysis of the BAC end sequences suggested that {{the evolution of the}} three genomes is widely varied, with the genome of H. virescens being the most conserved as a typical lepidopteran, whereas both genomes of H. erato and M. sexta appear to have evolved significantly, resulting in a higher level of species- or evolutionary lineage-specific sequences. Conclusion The high-quality and large-insert BAC libraries of the insects, together with the identified BACs containing genes of interest, provide valuable information, resources and tools for comprehensive understanding and studies of the insect genomes and for addressing many fundamental questions in Lepidoptera. The sample of the genomic sequences provides the first insight into the constitution and evolution of the insect genomes. </p...|$|R
