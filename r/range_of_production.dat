6000|$|Our {{friend was}} {{slightly}} nervous; {{that went with}} his character as a student of fine prose, went with the artist's general disposition to vibrate; {{and there was a}} particular thrill in the idea that Henry St. George might {{be a member of the}} party. For the young aspirant he had remained a high literary figure, in spite of the lower <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> to which he had fallen after his first three great successes, the comparative absence of quality in his later work. There had been moments when Paul Overt almost shed tears for this; but now that he was near him--he had never met him--he was conscious only of the fine original source and of his own immense debt. After he had taken a turn or two up and down the gallery he came out again and descended the steps. He was but slenderly supplied with a certain social boldness--it was really a weakness in him--so that, conscious of a want of acquaintance with the four persons in the distance, he gave way to motions recommended by their not committing him to a positive approach. There was a fine English awkwardness in this--he felt that too as he sauntered vaguely and obliquely across the lawn, taking an independent line. Fortunately there was an equally fine English directness in the way one of the gentlemen presently rose and made as if to [...] "stalk" [...] him, though with an air of conciliation and reassurance. To this demonstration Paul Overt instantly responded, even if the gentleman were not his host. He was tall, straight and elderly and had, like the great house itself, a pink smiling face, and into the bargain a white moustache. Our young man met him halfway while he laughed and said: [...] "Er--Lady Watermouth told us you were coming; she asked me just to look after you." [...] Paul Overt thanked him, liking him on the spot, and turned round with him to walk toward the others. [...] "They've all gone to church--all except us," [...] the stranger continued as they went; [...] "we're just sitting here--it's so jolly." [...] Overt pronounced it jolly indeed: it was such a lovely place. He mentioned that he was having the charming impression for the first time.|$|E
