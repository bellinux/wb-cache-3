50|$|<b>Ramipril</b> {{was found}} to have similar results as telmisartan, an {{angiotensin}} II receptor blocker.|$|E
50|$|The {{study showed}} {{telmisartan}} was {{as effective as}} <b>ramipril</b> but with lower rates of cough and angioedema, which led to fewer discontinuations. The combination group experienced similar efficacy, but with increased risk of hypotensive symptoms. Moreover, in a patient population selected to tolerate ACE inhibitors, telmisartan was shown to be better tolerated and associated with higher treatment compliance than <b>ramipril.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in {{combination}} with <b>Ramipril</b> Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) {{was one of the}} largest ARB clinical studies ever undertaken; 25,620 patients from 733 centres in 41 countries were randomised for 5.5 years of treatment of either telmisartan, the ACE inhibitor <b>ramipril</b> or a combination of the two. The study aimed to investigate the role of telmisartan in cardiovascular (CV) protection through the primary composite outcome of death from CV causes, myocardial infarction, stroke or hospitalization for heart failure, in high CV risk patients.|$|E

50|$|He {{has helped}} in {{outsourcing}} of several products like Metoprolol extended release + Amlodipine, Metoprolol XL + <b>Ramipril,</b> Cefoperazone + sulbactam (2:1 combination) and Quetiapine Sustained Released to various multi-national and Indian pharmaceutical companies.|$|E
50|$|The Heart Outcomes and Prevention Evaluation trial {{seemed to}} show <b>ramipril</b> possessed cardioprotective qualities which {{extended}} beyond its qualities as an antihypertensive. However, {{the trial and}} the interpretation of its results have been criticised.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ramipril,</b> a prodrug or {{precursor}} drug, {{is converted}} to the active metabolite ramiprilat by carboxylesterase 1. Ramiprilat is mostly excreted by the kidneys. Its half-life is variable (3-16 hours), and is prolonged by heart and liver failure, as well as kidney failure.|$|E
50|$|Serious {{allergic}} reactions to this drug are unlikely, but immediate medical attention must be sought if they occur. Symptoms {{of a serious}} allergic reaction include, {{but are not limited}} to a rash or swelling of the face, mouth, tongue, or throat. In extreme cases, <b>ramipril</b> may lead to potentially fatal liver problems.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ramipril,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Altace among others, is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, used to treat high blood {{pressure}} (hypertension) and congestive heart failure. By inhibiting an enzyme, ACE inhibitors relax the muscles around small arteries (arterioles). The arterioles expand and allow blood to flow through more easily. This reduces blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|In current medical practice, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system's overactivity (and {{resultant}} hypertension) is {{more commonly}} reduced using either ACE inhibitors (such as <b>ramipril</b> and perindopril) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs, such as losartan, irbesartan or candesartan) {{rather than a}} direct oral renin inhibitor. ACE inhibitors or ARBs {{are also part of}} the standard treatment after a heart attack.|$|E
50|$|Moexipril {{is highly}} lipophilic, {{and is in}} the same {{hydrophobic}} range as quinapril, benazepril, and <b>ramipril.</b> Lipophilic ACE inhibitors are able to penetrate membranes more readily, thus tissue ACE may be a target in addition to plasma ACE. A significant reduction in tissue ACE (lung, myocardium, aorta, and kidney) activity has been shown after moexipril use.|$|E
50|$|Beta-blockers are the {{first-line}} therapy as they induce bradycardia {{and give}} time for ventricles to fill. There {{is some evidence}} that calcium channel blocker drugs may be of benefit in reducing ventricular stiffness in some cases (verapamil has the benefit lowering the heart rate). Likewise, treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, such as enalapril, <b>ramipril,</b> and many others, may be of benefit due to their effect on preventing ventricular remodeling but under control to avoid hypotension.|$|E
5000|$|Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are drugs used in diabetics, heart disease, {{and high}} blood pressure. In 10-25% {{of the people who}} take it, it can cause them to have a cough as a side effect. Cessation of ACE Inhibitor use {{is the only way to}} stop the cough. Such {{medicines}} for hypertension are very common in use such as <b>ramipril</b> and quinapril. There are cases of [...] "cough of unknown origin" [...] who had resolution with stopping the drug.|$|E
50|$|Another team, led by Bronwyn Kingwell, Head of Baker IDI's Metabolic and Vascular Physiology, {{have found}} a new use for an old drug. The {{researchers}} found that after taking the standard anti-hypertensive drug <b>Ramipril,</b> patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which restricts mobility due to leg pain, enjoyed a longer and less painful time on their feet. For some patients, {{this could be the}} difference between living independently and living under the care of others {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
50|$|It is {{marketed as}} Prilace by Arrow Pharmaceuticals in Australia, Ramipro by Westfield Pharma in the Philippines, Tritace by Sanofi-Aventis in Italy and United States and Altace by King Pharmaceuticals in the United States, Novapril by Pharmanova in Ghana, Ramitens by PharmaSwiss, Ampril by Krka in Slovenia, Corpril by Cemelog-BRS in Hungary, Piramil and Prilinda by Hemofarm in Serbia, by Lek in Poland and by Novartis and Opsonin Pharma Limited as Ramace in Bangladesh, and in Canada as Altace (Sonfi) and <b>Ramipril</b> (Pharmascience).|$|E
5000|$|The {{compound}} {{was protected}} by the [...] which {{was assigned to the}} German pharmaceutical company Hoechst AG (since merged into Aventis) on 29 October 1991. The patent was scheduled to expire on 29 October 2008. On 11 September 2007, in an appeal by the Indian company Lupin Ltd., the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed a district court trial verdict and found that Aventis's patent on <b>ramipril</b> was invalid for [...] "obviousness", opening this drug to generic manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|The {{ratio of}} Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for Polycap and {{reference}} drugs was within 80-125% for atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, <b>ramipril,</b> ramiprilat and dose normalized salicylic acid. However, for simvastatin the point estimate of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for Ln-transformed data {{were significantly lower}} (~25%) and for its active metabolite, simvastatin acid, it was significantly higher (~60%). Thus, the increased bioavailability of active simvastatin acid compensated {{for the loss of}} bioavailability of simvastatin alone. There was no indication of kinetic drug-drug interaction in any of components.|$|E
50|$|In {{diabetes}} extracellular glucose concentration increases, {{this high}} glucose level leads to up-regulation of SGLT-2 {{that leads to}} more absorption of glucose in the kidneys. That is not good, since these effects cause maintenance of hyperglycemia. Because Na+ is absorbed {{at the same time}} as glucose via SGLT-2, the up-regulation of SGLT-2 probably leads to development or maintenance of hypertension. In study where rats were given either <b>ramipril</b> or losartan, levels of SGLT-2 protein and mRNA significantly reduced. In patients with diabetes, hypertension is a common problem so this may have relevance in this disease.|$|E
50|$|Bioavailability of the {{components}} of the Polycap (aspirin, <b>ramipril,</b> simvastatin, atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide) when formulated as a single capsule was compared to identical capsules with each of its components administered separately in a five arm, randomized, single-dose, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, crossover trial with at least 2 week washout period in a total of 195 healthy humans. Plasma concentrations of each drug and where applicable its active metabolite were measured using validated LC-MS/MS and UPLC. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters and their standard deviations were computed for each analyte. Comparative bioavailability and absence of drug-drug interaction for each component were computed based on a point estimate of test/reference (T/R) ratio of geometric means falling within 80-125% for Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞.|$|E
5000|$|A {{hypothesis}} initially {{proposed by}} Wald and Law had recommended a six-drug combination {{to be taken}} by patients over age 55 at risk of cardiovascular disease events, which would include three half-dose antihypertensives drugs, aspirin, a statin, and folic acid. After further research showed no improvement in clinical outcomes for patients taking folic acid, it was omitted from Cadila Pharmaceuticals' formulation. As tested, [...] "Polycap" [...] combines 100 milligrams of aspirin, with simvastatin (a generic version of Zocor, the cholesterol-lowering statin; 20 mg) and low doses of three blood pressure medications, atenolol (50 mg), <b>ramipril</b> (5 mg) and thiazide (12.5 mg). And despite containing multiple drugs, the pill has a fairly small size which can facilitate swallowing.|$|E
50|$|Brenner {{made his}} high-school diploma in 1985 in Donauwörth and studied {{medicine}} from 1986 to 93 at the LMU Munich. During his medical studies {{he was promoted}} as a scholar of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung. For several years {{he used to work}} as the speaker for this organization in Munich. After his medical degree in 1993 he worked as a physician in a traineeship of the Dept. of Cardiac Surgery/Klinikum Großhadern in the team of Bruno Reichart. Brenner withdrew 1996 and 1997 among the last twenty applicants for a cosmonaut trainee program in Star City (Zvyozdny gorodok) in Russia in a national (15.000 applicants) and international (150.000 applicants) final selection. Today {{he is a member of}} the Verein zur Förderung der Raumfahrt. From 1995 to 97 he worked as a scientific assistant at the Dept. of Cardiac Surgery hospital and polyclinic, Klinikum Großhadern of the LMU Munich and became admitted to leader for clinical, pharmacological studies. Brenner was promoted to doctor of medicine at the Physiological Institute of the LMU Munich with magna cum laude 1995. His dissertation covered the effect of different peptides on the sympathetic nervous system of Brown-Norway rats before and after inhibition of converting enzyme. This work was essential for the development of the medicine <b>Ramipril.</b> In 1997 he obtained a scholarship of the Bavarian Research Foundation (Bayerische Forschungsstiftung) for a project dealing with the development of gene technological and mechanical proceedings to realize xenogeneic transplantation of pig organs at the Institute for Surgery Research of the LMU. In the framework of this project among others he performed various xenoperfusion and transplantation test series of landrace- and transgenic pig hearts. In 1999 Brenner moved within the Dept. of Cardiac Surgery of the LMU in the team of Bruno Reichart into the Augustinum. In 2003 he concluded the specialist training for cardiac surgery. He continued to work at the xenotransplantation follow-up project dealing with the production of multi-transgenic pigs and the development of iimmunomodulatoryl strategies for the clinical xenotransplantation. In the same year he moved as a surgeon to the Klinikum Großhadern of the LMU at the same Dept. of Cardiac Surgery. In 2004 he finished his habilitation with a work on the influence of immunoadsorption on xenogenic immunosuppression mechanisms in a perfusion model and in xenotranplantation of landrace an hDAF transgenic pig hearts in primates, recorded in a work encompassing 1450 pages. In 2004 he reached “venia legendi”, was named “Privatdozent” and functional attending chief resident and in 2006 attending deputy at the Dept. of Cardiac Surgery and member of the Munich Lung Transplantation Group (ex- und implantation). In 2011 Brenner was named associate professor at the LMU and was promoted to the degree of an academic director in 2012.|$|E
