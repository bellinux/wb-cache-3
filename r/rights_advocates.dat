5|$|Fewer {{children}} are now employed in hazardous environments, but their employment in non-hazardous jobs, prevalently as domestic help, violates {{the spirit of}} the constitution {{in the eyes of many}} critics and human <b>rights</b> <b>advocates.</b> More than 16.5million {{children are}} in employment. India was ranked 88 out of 159 countries in 2005, according to the degree to which corruption is perceived to exist among public officials and politicians.|$|E
5|$|As supervisor, Newsom had as his {{centerpiece}} a voter initiative called Care Not Cash (Measure N), {{which offered}} care, supportive housing, drug treatment, and help from behavioral health specialists {{for the homeless}} in lieu of direct cash aid from the state's general assistance program. Many homeless <b>rights</b> <b>advocates</b> protested against the initiative. The successfully passed ballot measure raised the political profile of Gavin Newsom and provided the volunteers, donors, and campaign staff that helped make him a leading contender for the mayorship in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{gun control}} advocates have voiced {{concern over the}} {{perceived}} loophole in legislation, and campaigned to require background checks and record-keeping for all gun sales. Contrarily, gun <b>rights</b> <b>advocates</b> have stated {{that there is no}} loophole, that current laws provide a single, uniform set of rules for commercial gun sellers regardless of the place of sale, and that no part of the United States Constitution empowers the federal government to regulate non-commercial, intrastate transfers of legal firearms types between private citizens.|$|E

5|$|Magoffin and the {{legislature}} continued to clash throughout {{the remainder of}} 1861 and into 1862. They found agreement only on the most menial of legislation, such as a bill to allow the common schools to continue the sessions that had been interrupted by the outbreak of hostilities in 1861. He found particularly onerous a bill forfeiting the citizenship of anyone who fought for or aided the Confederacy, but in March 1862, his veto of the bill was overridden. Magoffin also opposed the military rule of Brigadier General Jeremiah T. Boyle, who he believed was violating {{the civil rights of}} states' <b>rights</b> <b>advocates,</b> even if they did not advocate secession.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{advocated}} for her husband's policy priorities by promoting bills that support it. She hosted a White House reception for women's <b>rights</b> <b>advocates</b> {{in celebration of}} {{the enactment of the}} Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 Pay equity law. She supported the economic stimulus bill in visits to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Education. Some observers looked favorably upon her legislative activities, while others said that she should be less involved in politics. According to her representatives, she intended to visit all United States Cabinet-level agencies in order to get acquainted with Washington.|$|E
5|$|The iPad {{does not}} employ digital rights {{management}} (DRM), but the OS prevents users from copying or transferring certain content outside of Apple's platform without authorization, such as TV shows, movies, and apps. Also, the iPad's development model requires anyone creating an app for the iPad to sign a non-disclosure agreement and pay for a developer subscription. Critics argue Apple's centralized app approval process {{and control of the}} platform itself could stifle software innovation. Of particular concern to digital <b>rights</b> <b>advocates</b> is Apple's ability to remotely disable or delete apps on any iPad at any time.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights {{released}} an advisory opinion {{calling for an}} end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools. While recognizing the right to freedom of expression, the commission also recognizes those Native Americans and civil <b>rights</b> <b>advocates</b> that maintain these mascots, by promoting stereotypes, may violate anti-discrimination laws. When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans.|$|E
5|$|French women's <b>rights</b> <b>advocates</b> invited {{international}} feminists {{to participate}} in a parallel conference to the Paris Conference in hopes that they could gain permission {{to participate in}} the official conference. The Inter-Allied Women's Conference asked to be allowed to submit suggestions to the peace negotiations and commissions and were granted the right to sit on commissions dealing specifically with women and children. Though they asked for enfranchisement and full legal protection under the law equal with men, those rights were ignored. Women won the right to serve in all capacities, including as staff or delegates in the League of Nations organization. They also won a declaration that member nations should prevent trafficking of women and children and should equally support humane conditions for children, women and men labourers. At the Zürich Peace Conference held between 17-19 May, 1919, the women of the WILPF condemned the terms of the Treaty of Versailles for both is punitive measures, as well as its failure to provide for condemnation of violence and exclusion of women from civil and political participation. Upon reading the Rules of Procedure for the League of Nations, Catherine Marshall, an English suffragist, discovered that the guidelines were completely undemocratic and they were modified based on her suggestion.|$|E
5|$|While Tyler {{wished to}} attend to his private life and family, he was soon {{occupied}} with the presidential election of 1836. He had been suggested as a vice presidential candidate since early 1835, and {{the same day the}} Virginia Democrats issued the expunging instruction, the Virginia Whigs nominated him as their candidate. The new Whig Party was not organized enough to hold a national convention and name a single ticket against Van Buren, Jackson's chosen successor. Instead, Whigs in various regions put forth their own preferred tickets, reflecting the party's tenuous coalition: the Massachusetts Whigs nominated Daniel Webster and Francis Granger, the Anti-Masons of the Northern and border states backed William Henry Harrison and Granger, and the states' <b>rights</b> <b>advocates</b> of the middle and lower South nominated Hugh Lawson White and John Tyler. In Maryland, the Whig ticket was Harrison and Tyler and in South Carolina it was Willie P. Mangum and Tyler. The Whigs wanted to deny Van Buren a majority in the Electoral College, throwing the election into the House of Representatives, where deals could be made. Tyler hoped electors would be unable to elect a vice president, and that he {{would be one of the}} top two vote-getters, from whom the Senate, under the Twelfth Amendment, must choose.|$|E
