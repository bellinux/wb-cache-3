Among the accomplishments of the session were raising the state's minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, {{increasing}} the speed limit on major state highways to , and implementing new safety requirements for social workers and coal miners. Additional legislation stalled after negotiations over how to make the state's retirement system solvent reached an impasse.

Democrats in the state House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough to warrant a special session. They claimed the call was an attempt by Fletcher to boost his sagging poll numbers against Beshear, and the House adjourned after only 90 minutes without acting on any of Fletcher's agenda. Fletcher denied the claims and insisted that a tax incentive program was needed immediately to keep the state in the <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> proposed coal gasification plant to be built by Peabody Energy. After negotiating with legislators, Fletcher called another session for August; the session included only the tax incentive program, which the Assembly passed.|$|E

5|$|Returning {{once again}} to {{domestic}} cricket, Hamence scored 85 and 66 against Queensland, and this kept him in the <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> place in the national team, as he toured with The Invincibles in England in 1948. He was not selected to play {{in any of the}} Tests, however he reiterated when interviewed in 2008 that he felt no resentment over not having played.

5|$|With Menem constitutionally {{restricted}} from <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> third presidential term, Duhalde ran {{for president}} in 1999. Kirchner sided with Duhalde in his dispute with Menem, and sought reelection as governor of Santa Cruz. The PJ was defeated {{on the national level}} by the radical Fernando de la Rúa, who became president. Kirchner was reelected, despite the growth of the UCR in the province. Following an economic crisis, De la Rúa resigned two years later during the December 2001 riots. The Congress appointed Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, governor of San Luis, as interim president. When Rodríguez Saá also resigned, Duhalde was appointed president. He was the politician with the highest legitimacy to be appointed president, as he had placed second in the 1999 elections and won the 2001 legislative elections in the Buenos Aires province, the district of Argentina with the largest population. He slowly restored the economy, and hastened the presidential election when two piqueteros were killed during a demonstration. However, the provincial elections were held on their original dates.|$|E
