40|$|International audienceThe {{swelling}} of layered smectite clay particles {{consists of a}} change in the interlayer <b>repetition</b> <b>distance</b> (d-spacing) as a function of temperature and humidity. For the synthetic clay sodium fluorohectorite, hydrodynamically stable hydration states with zero, one and two intercalated monolayers of water have previously been reported, with discrete jumps in d-spacing at the transitions between the hydration states. Keeping the temperature fixed and varying the ambient relative humidity, we find small reproducible d-spacing changes also within the hydration states. These changes are monotonous as a function of relative humidity, and one order of magnitude smaller than the shift in d-spacing that is typical of the transition between two hydration states. The reproducibility and reliability of this relative humidity controlled d-shift enables us to use the interlayer <b>repetition</b> <b>distance</b> d as a measure of the local humidity surrounding the clay particles. We provide an example of application of this observation: imposing a humidity gradient over a quasi-one-dimensional temperature-controlled sample, and using x-ray diffraction to record the d-spacing, we are able to extract profiles of the relative humidity along the sample length. Their time evolution describes the transport of water through the mesoporous space inside the clay. An analysis of the measured humidity profiles based on the Boltzmann transformation, under certain simplifying assumptions, yields a diffusive behavior that is either normal or possibly weakly anomalous...|$|E
40|$|We show {{experimentally}} that gaseous CO 2 intercalates {{into the}} interlayer {{space of the}} synthetic smectite clay Na-fluorohectorite at conditions {{not too far from}} ambient. The mean interlayer <b>repetition</b> <b>distance</b> of the clay when CO 2 is intercalated is found to be 12. 5 Å for the conditions − 20 °C and 15 bar. The magnitude of the expansion of the interlayer upon intercalation is indistinguishable from that observed in the dehydrated–monohydrated transition for H 2 O, but the possibility of water intercalation is ruled out by a careful analysis of the experimental conditions and repeating the measurements exposing the clay to nitrogen gas. The dynamics of the process is observed to be dependent on the pressure, with a higher intercalation rate at increased pressure. The rate of CO 2 intercalation at the studied conditions is found to be several orders of magnitude slower than the intercalation rate of water or humidity at ambient pressure and temperature...|$|E

The distribution of displacements around a single charged oxygen vacancy and di-vacancy, determination of binding energy of oxygen vacancy in di-vacancy demonstrate that there is, in principle, {{the possibility of the}} charge order formation in YBCO by charged oxygen vacancies or di-vacancies. It is shown that the charge order formation first of all should be formed near crystal lattice defects and that the high-angle grain boundaries (GBs) regions are preferable places for this formation.

It is a task which can be used to expose the basic mechanisms by which humans connect memories. In this work we have made use of a publicly available database of free associations to model the exploration of the averaged network of associations using a statistical and the ACT-R model. We performed, in addition, an online experiment asking participants to navigate the averaged network using their individual preferences for word associations. We have investigated the statistics of word repetitions in this guided association task.

The general models for finding exact repetitions in one string and in a finite set of strings are introduced.

40|$|Constant {{interaction}} with a dynamic environment-from riding a bicycle to segmenting speech-makes {{sensitivity to the}} sequential structure of the world a fundamental dimension of information processing. Accounts of sequence learning vary widely, with some authors arguing that parsing and segmentation processes are central, and others proposing that sequence learning involves mere memorization. In this paper, we argue that sequence knowledge is essentially statistical in nature, and that sequence learning involves simple associative prediction mechanisms. We focus on a choice reaction situation introduced by Lee (1997), in which participants were exposed to material that follows a single abstract rule, namely that stimuli are selected randomly, but never appear {{more than once in}} a legal sequence. Perhaps surprisingly, people can learn this rule very well. Or can they? We offer a conceptual replication of the original finding, but a very different interpretation of the results, as well as simulation work that makes it clear how highly abstract dimensions of the stimulus material can in fact be learned based on elementary associative mechanisms. We conclude that, when relevant, memory is optimized to facilitate responding to events that have not occurred recently, and that sequence learning in general always involves sensitivity to <b>repetition</b> <b>distance.</b> Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

40|$|International audienceA {{simple and}} {{effective}} mean for controlling electrostatic interactions during mineral precipitation in {{water is the}} use of a "catanionic" template. Such strategy is used to precipitate calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite or HAP) and obtain mesoporous materials. Mixtures of catanionic surfactants with phosphate head-groups (polyoxyethylene oleyl ether phosphate) and a quaternary ammonium (myristyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) are used in order to obtain a template with adjustable surface charge and test the "charge-matching" effect. This effect manifests by a strong dependence of the template shape on molar fraction, which governs the charge per unit area of the surfactant as well as the growth of inorganic network. We first explore the effect of high ionic strength and pH variation on phase diagram of template. A hexagonal structure is observed for anionic surfactant, and such organization is still preserved in the presence of large quantity of cationic component. Synthesis of HAP is then performed using independently various volume fractions of template and various mole fraction of anionic component in the template. For samples with low amount of surfactant and an excess of anionic component, TOC analysis shows more than 80 % of the added surfactant is trapped in the precipitate. These samples display in SAXS three peaks that are characteristic of a hexagonal structure. Such structure, where the <b>repetition</b> <b>distance</b> is much lower than twice surfactant chain length, has not yet been described in surfactant self-assembly. This must be a monolayer microstructure, but symmetry group is not known since higher orders cannot be detected. The HAP-template hybrid structure disappears after calcination, and the BET surface of calcined powders is smaller than for HAP particles synthesized in homogeneous conditions...|$|E
40|$|Passivated metal lines {{commonly}} used in integrated circuits show thermally induced stresses and strains due to the difference #DELTA##alpha# of the thermal expansion coefficients of the lines {{on the one hand}} and the underlying Si-substrate and the surrounding ceramic passivation on the other hand. These stresses depend on various parameters such as the geometry and the elastic constants of both, line and passivation, and - for the case of an array of parallel lines - on the <b>repetition</b> <b>distance</b> of the lines. They can cause voidage and plastic flow of the lines and thus failure of the integrated circuits. Combining the theory of eigenstrains and calculations made with the finite element method (FEM) one can derive equations which connect the magnitude of voidage and plastic shear deformation with experimental strain data measured by X-ray diffraction. In order to obtain the dependences of the strains and stresses from the parameters mentioned above systematic FEM calculations hav ebeen made for an infinite array of parallel lines with variations of the geometries and the elastic constants. The calculations show that cooling from elevated processing temperatures, e. g. passivation temperature, results in high tensile strains in the 1 -direction (parallel to the lines). These elastic strains are equal #DELTA##alpha##DELTA#T and are higher than the strains in the 2 -direction (perpendicular to the lines and parallel to the substrate surface) and in the 3 -direction (perpendicular to the lines and to the substrate surface). The elastic strains in the 2 - and 3 -directions strongly depend on the aspect ratio A (line thickness divided by the line width). (orig.)

For the synthetic clay sodium fluorohectorite, hydrodynamically stable hydration states with zero, one and two intercalated monolayers of water have previously been reported, with discrete jumps in d-spacing at the transitions between the hydration states. Keeping the temperature fixed and varying the relative humidity surrounding a powder sample, we find small reproducible d-spacing changes also within the hydration states. These changes are monotonous as a function of relative humidity, and one order of magnitude smaller than the shift in d-spacing that is typical of the transition between two hydration states. We have used this observation to monitor the humidity content of a clay sample in situ, in a non-invasive manner. Imposing a humidity gradient between the two ends of a quasi-one-dimensional weakly-hydrated sample, we use space- and time-resolved X-ray diffraction to follow the transport of water by monitoring the {{swelling of}} clay particles. From the series of diffractograms we are able to extract profiles of the relative humidity along the sample length. The time evolution of these profiles describes the transport of water through the mesoporous space inside the clay: An analysis of the measured humidity profiles based on the Boltzmann transform, under certain simplifying assumptions, yields a diffusive behavior that is either normal or possibly weakly anomalous. The humidity profiles also provide the dependence of the effective diffusion coefficient D of the water vapor in the clay mesoporosity {{as a function of the}} local concentration of water molecules. The concentration-dependence of D impacts the transport process significantly. Another effect that potentially alters the process is the removal of water molecules from the mesoporosity by intercalation inside the clay grains.

40|$|International audienceSmectite clays {{are widely}} {{found on the}} Earth surface. They possess a {{connected}} mesoporous space in the micrometer range, and nanopores inside the mineral grains. The grains are stacks of individual 1 nm-thick clay particles (the layers) {{with the ability to}} swell by incorporating H 2 O molecules (or other molecules such as CO 2) in-between the layers, depending on the ambiant temperature and on the relative humidity (RH) present in the mesoporous space surrounding the grain. Imposing a gradient of RH along a temperature- controlled dry sample of smectite clay, we investigate the diffusive transport of water molecules in vapor phase through the material. As water molecules diffuse through the mesoporous space, (i) some of them intercalate into the nanopores, (ii) causing the grains to swell and the separation of clay grains into particles of smaller thickness. From (ii) results a change in the geometry of the mesoporous space, with a decrease in the mesoporous volume available for vapor diffusion. These two effects (i and ii) render the transport process potentially anomalous. We monitor it using space- and time-resolved X-ray diffraction at a synchrotron source. Indeed, water absorption into the nano-layered grains changes the interlayer <b>repetition</b> <b>distance</b> (d-spacing) of the stacks, which is seen in the diffraction data. A separate calibration experiment allows mapping this monotonous evolution of d {{as a function of the}} RH. By measuring d in space and time in the transport experiments we thus record the time evolution of RH profiles along the direction of the initial RH gradient. To model the data we consider a 1 D effective diffusion process described by a fractional time diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient that depends on the RH. It is possible to rescale all RH profiles onto a single master curve as a function of (x/t) γ/ 2, where γ is the exponent characteristic of the fractional derivative. We observe that when the clay sample is prepared with sodium cations intercalated in the nanopores, vapor transport is normal (γ= 2), while if the interlayer cation is lithium the transport is strongly subdiffusive. This is explained by the different dynamics of cation intercalation in these two clays. In both cases we also obtain the dependence of the effective diffusion coefficient on relative humidity...|$|E
40|$|Inventory for Reverse Journey is {{the title}} of a {{collection}} of photographic artefacts and found objects, which I have collected over the last twenty years. The title refers to one specific type of artist's journey, which is applicable to the `chronotope' of my archive, as a `metaphorical journey in space and time' (Bakhtin 1981, p. 81). The `city',`provincial town', `road', `threshold' and `interior' are recurrent motifs, which Bakhtin fused together to describe the historical evolution of the novel in relation to its different genres. Bakhtin's motifs are expanded as the basis of an evolutionary nomenclature of the artist's-journey, as a form of spatial mapping and identity formation. Alongside other sources from literature (Alain Robbe-Grillet), cinema (Michelangelo Antonioni), psychoanalysis (Kierkegaard) and critical theory (Walter Benjamin) I have developed a theoretical framework, which initially originated in an empirical process, that is reflected in the antecedents of this project. The research process, as a journey itself, has concretised this approach within a systems-based practice. This is mirrored {{in the work of the}} artists under investigation, as their differences and similarities are highlighted within a broad contextual analysis. Accordingly the tone of the writing shifts its register at different points in the thesis. My journey is just one example of several paradigmatic formations of `travel' as a strategy, which investigates the work of six different artists, as a voluntary or involuntary form of exile. A deskilled use of the photographic image is examined in the work of Ed Ruscha, Douglas Huebler and Bas jan Ader in the spatial mapping of their chosen locations. The work of these artists manifests travel, as a strategy, in a benign form of regional and expatriate exile. The investigation shifts its focus from the New World to Europe, where the work of Jimmie Durham, Gustav Metzger and Kurt Schwitters is analysed in relation to their transformation of found objects and materials, and their relationship with a former 'home'. Their position registers different degrees of the `impossibility of return' to a point of origin, which exists in the mind rather than as a physical location. The transience of their work, and use of disparate materials, is counterbalanced by their physical presence in the work. Conversely Ader, Huebler and Ruscha are linked by a scale of decreasing visibility, as they are sublimated within their work in the formation of, what is now construed as, a unique photographic presence. The starting point for which is a return to the formative years of conceptualism in the 1960 's, which set the scene for Durham and Metzger from the 1970 's onwards. The spectre of Schwitters practice of forming (Formung) and unforming (Entformung) is significant for my analysis of the dematerialisation of the art-work and artist, by processes of series and <b>repetition,</b> <b>distance</b> and proximity, movement and stasis. Although `travel' is a ubiquitous term, I continue to use it as a portmanteau, which carries with it the themes and `salient' features of a typology of artist's journeys. In a moment of perceived obsolescence as digital information systems engender a culture of `selective-amnesia', these thoughts have informed my work, which runs parallel to the artist case-studies, and the material transformation of the photographic image and found object.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to characterise the physical-chemical {{properties}} of alkylglucosides. Alkylglucosides are non-ionic surfactants synthesized from glucose and a fatty alcohol. The glucose molecule constitutes the hydrophilic head group and the fatty alcohol constitutes the hydrophobic tail. The two parts are linked together with a glucoside bond. In nature, the building and breakage of a glucoside bond are controlled by different enzymes called glucosidases. This makes alkylglucosides highly biodegradable. Alkylglucosides also have low toxicity towards biological life. Therefore, alkylglucosides are very interesting in applications like laundry, car wash, shampoo, personal care products and cosmetics. There are two possible ways of attaching a glucose molecule to the fatty alcohol, viz. a- or b-bond. The two ways give different physical-chemical properties to the alkylglucoside. One such property is different packing in a crystal lattice. In this study, the physical-chemical properties of some short-chain alkylglucosides have been determined, viz. C 8 -, C 9 -, and C 10 -alkylglucosides. Alkylglucosides with a- and b-bonding, as well as straight and branched tails have been studied. The study includes both alkylmonoglucosides, which are anomerically pure, and commercially available alkylpolyglucosides. The study is based on the determination of binary surfactant/water phase diagrams (temperature vs. concentration) and ternary surfactant/ surfactant/water phase diagrams. The different phases in the phase diagram have been investigated to obtain information concerning aggregates size/structure and aggregate-aggregate interactions. Techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) self-diffusion, microscope, small-angel X-ray scattering (SAXS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and fluorescence have been used to determine the physical-chemical properties. A general feature of alkylglucosides is a broad solution phase extending from neat water to approximately 60 - 70 wt% surfactant. At higher surfactant concentrations, liquid crystalline phases are formed. Alkylglucosides with straight tails can form hexagonal, cubic and lamellar liquid crystalline phases, whereas alkylglucosides with branched tails only form lamellar liquid crystalline phases. A conclusion from the study is that alkylglucosides do not form spherical micelles but elongated aggregates. The aggregates size increase significantly when the number of carbon atoms in the tail increase. When there are ten or more carbon atoms in the tail a phase separation occurs at dilute concentration. A mechanism behind the phase separation has been proposed based on the dilution of a surfactant network. <b>Repetition</b> <b>distances</b> and head group areas in the liquid crystalline phases have been calculated. A general observation is the surfactant head group area are fairly unchanged when the concentration increases. An explanation for this behaviour is the glucose molecule requires a certain amount of hydration water. When this condition is met there is no gain in free energy by changing the head group area at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface...|$|R

40|$|Background Conference theme: Using {{behaviour}} change theory to create high-quality interventions and products. BetterPoints is a localised {{behaviour change}} system that uses incentivisation, recognition and social interaction – all {{driven by an}} innovative technology. Our main method of engagement is a proprietary smartphone app. The app {{is part of a}} powerful behaviour change technology platform that allows rapid customisation, massive reward flexibility and sophisticated reporting. This includes a portal, content management system, digital dashboard and API. It is presently being used across several Local Authorities in England to motivate people to visit parks, use sustainable transport, be more active, make healthy lifestyle choices and engage with their community. Today, more than 21, 000 people earn BetterPoints for positive activities in their locality, such as walking, cycling, car-sharing or attending weight loss classes. Points can be redeemed for shopping vouchers or be given to charities or community groups to turn into money for fundraising purposes. Description Our approach combines behaviour change theoretical underpinnings with deep understanding of the loyalty and rewards marketplace, digital marketing and social media. Motivating real world change involves moving from incentives to emotional investment, personal and social engagement. Extrinsic rewards can influence the formation of pro-social behaviours that continue after the rewards have stopped if participants find intrinsic and social motivation in the action itself. As illustrated by the Charness and Gneezy (2009) excerpt below: “In the case of exercise, establishing a habit by requiring multiple and frequent visits seems necessary—especially for those who have little or no previous habit of exercising. A self-commitment device, or even just a decision that would impel us to go to the gym for a month before evaluating the cost and benefit of exercising, may result in a different assessment of the net value of the activity. ” BetterPoints programmes take into account a number of factors from multiple models of Behaviour Change, including internal (attitudes, values, habits and personal norms) and external (incentives, constraints and social) factors. The technology platform is flexible enough to address individual change over time, meet the varied goals of targeted intervention programs and adapt to multi faceted behaviour change frameworks as they evolve. BetterPoints addresses the Motivation section of the COM-B Hub of the Behaviour Change Wheel (Michie, 2011), with incentivisation as the main intervention function. Additionally, it uses persuasion and education through communication and marketing about using the app, such as on-street posters, social media, blog-posts, emails, and mobile push-notification messages. It is possible to record the actions of those involved in order to track success and optimise rewards, at the individual and group level. For example, for a woman who has a BMI of over 30, with low self-reported activity levels, the system could reward her for taking 5 short walks a week, and after a month of 15 activities has been completed, it could give an automatic additional monthly bonus. This activity would be supported by social media, email and push notification messages encouraging her to get moving, draw attention to the benefits of activity for health, give updates on how many points she had, and encouragement to notice positive intrinsic aspects of her different choices, such as appreciating nature on a walk. The programme could then give her social rewards for going for a walk with a friend, going to exercise classes or doing several walks in one day, recording by time taken or distance covered. Rewards and incentives build up over time and in relation to what has already been achieved in the programme, all automatically recorded within the system. Case Study - Birmingham Birmingham City Council’s Wellbeing team needed to capture and measure activity that fell outside of the scope of structured projects, to demonstrate the value to public health of “informal” activity in the city’s parks. This project was initiated as a pilot project in September 2014 with the aim of incentivising users to increase their levels of physical activity and recording it via a smartphone app. Aims • To establish whether rewards would work as a means to capture data using formal methods • To reward further engagement and activity where that met the needs of the Council’s Public Health agenda. • In the longer term to reward and incentivise a range of activity that fell outside of the scope of Active Wellbeing, from volunteering to community activities, council recycling and so on. Data Capture An extensive dataset is now produced monthly for Birmingham City Council. This dataset is cross referenced by BCC’s Customer Knowledge - Corporate Strategy team to give insight into socio-economic profiles of park users, the relationship between activity in parks and Indices of Multiple Deprivation, activity levels and changes over time. A data reporting dashboard has been set up and is being developed based on feedback from this process. Ultimately these reports will be linked with economic analysis of early intervention on a range of health and social issues. Birmingham Programmes - Outcomes • The app is gaining in popularity; Registrations increasing month on month • We are engaging hard to reach groups; 46 % of participants were from the top 30 % most deprived areas (IMD) • Individual activity increases over time; 100 % increase in average activities per active user over 7 months This case study illustrates that rewarding participants at specific locations, for <b>repetitions,</b> <b>distances,</b> speeds and/or time taken, produces a data set to demonstrate that behaviours have changed and BetterPoint programmes are high quality interventions. We work increasingly with partners who can provide other intervention functions such as environmental restructuring, to create a tailored behaviour change system to address specific needs for particular populations. Conclusions The BetterPoints system is unique in it’s flexibility and ability to draw on multiple behaviour change models to create high quality interventions. Early findings from existing programmes being implemented for Local Authorities in the UK suggest that BetterPoints can demonstrate real-world behaviour change. We would like to work with academic partners to further investigate these real-world changes in behaviour and establish a robust evidence base...|$|R
