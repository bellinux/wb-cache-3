2500|$|Z02 - Spyder {{appearance}} : Black highlights on front, {{side and}} rear of body headlight openings, parking light openings, windshield, rear window and side window moldings, body sill, door and center pillar louvers, <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> <b>panel</b> - (bright window moldings with black exterior), black or gold rear accents (taillight blackouts and <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> <b>panel</b> decals), body color front air dam and rear spoiler, Spyder emblems (front facia, rear lock cover and sport steering wheel horn button insert), body side stripes with Spyder lettering in red, white or gold depending on body color, black painted styled-steel wheels with trim rings and center caps, black sport mirrors, special hood decal and rear spoiler decal. For the 1980 model year, Chevrolet combined the Spyder equipment and appearance packages into one Spyder equipment package with an RPO code of Z29 and included newly re-designed bold Spyder side decals {{and a new}} front air dam that blends into the front fender wheel openings. [...] Spyder decal color choices (five) were based primarily upon the interior color specified rather than the body color as in previous years.|$|E

40|$|Bumper {{is divided}} in two types, they are front bumper and rear bumper. Main {{function}} {{both of them}} are for absorbing impact by reducing damage and to the potential for bodily injury during an accident. Rear car bumper system has three main components. They are the fascia, energy absorber and bumper beam. The fascia is the outer cover in this system. It is attaches to the quarter panels and <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> <b>panel</b> of the system. The energy absorber attaches to the bumper beam. The bumper beam is mounted directly to the vehicle body. These components were reviewed for differences in shape and construction prior to being assembled to the vehicles. For this project, rear bumper of PROTON Persona car was chosen to be benchmarking. Then, the new rear bumper was design by using SOLIDWORK Software in dimensional of PROTON Persona car. By using FEA tools that is ALGOR software, the new design was analyzed at three different parts and constant force. Improvement of rear bumper design was compared based on material used, attachment, analysis on Stress Von Mises and displacement, installation, buying and repairing cost, and others. The important result is to improve rear bumper car and to give advantages to the car users such as remove and installation rear bumper knowledg...|$|E

At some point, the Corvette <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> was discontinued and replaced with a narrowed 7 1/2" [...] Ford truck <b>rear</b> <b>end.</b> As of 2005, the trikes have a new three-speed transmission that {{takes advantage of the}} extra stability and rear axle of a trike configuration.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{operating}} noise performance of a seat adjuster mechanism, benchmarking measurements were conducted in different cars for six and eight types of seat adjustment operation. The six types of operation include: seat moving up, seat moving down, seat front end up, seat front <b>end</b> down, seat <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> up and seat <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> down. The eight types of operation include: seat moving forward, seat moving backward, seat moving up, seat moving down, seat front end up, seat front <b>end</b> down, seat <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> up and seat <b>rear</b> <b>end</b> down. The noise and vibration levels, sound quality and root causes of the noise problem have been analysed and discussed in this paper. The noise characteristics have been identified, and the psychoacoustic parameters {{have been used to}} quantify sound quality of the seat adjuster. The objective assessment results have been found to match well with subjective evaluation results...|$|R
