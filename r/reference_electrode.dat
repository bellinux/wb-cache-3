The calomel electrode is used to work out the electrode potential of half cells. Last, but not least, the triple point of mercury, −38.8344°C, is a fixed point used as a temperature standard for the International Temperature Scale (ITS-90).|$|E

Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode. These protective coatings can be applied to other metals through by hot-dip galvanizing a substance into the molten form of the metal, or through the process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of chromate salts. Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they may act {{as an alternative to the}} standard hydrogen electrode in addition to being a secondary <b>reference</b> <b>electrode.</b>|$|E

25|$|The silver {{chloride}} electrode is {{most commonly used}} as a <b>reference</b> <b>electrode</b> in pH meters, although some designs use the saturated calomel electrode. The {{silver chloride}} electrode is simple to manufacture and provides high reproducibility. The <b>reference</b> <b>electrode</b> usually consists of a platinum wire that has contact with a silver / silver chloride mixture, which is immersed in a potassium chloride solution. There is a ceramic plug, {{which serves as a}} contact to the test solution, providing low resistance while preventing mixing of the two solutions.|$|E
25|$|For simplicity, many pH meters use a {{combination}} probe, constructed with the glass electrode and the <b>reference</b> <b>electrode</b> contained within a single probe. A detailed description of combination electrodes is given in the article on glass electrodes.|$|E
25|$|The {{electrode}} body contains {{potassium chloride}} {{to stabilize the}} silver chloride concentration. When working in seawater, this body can be removed and the chloride concentration is fixed by the stable salinity of the water.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an alternative strategy for manufacturing solid-state <b>reference</b> <b>electrodes</b> based on particles of graphite/silver/silver chloride synthesized by electroless deposition of metallic silver and silver chloride on graphite powder. Two kinds of <b>reference</b> <b>electrodes</b> were manufactured by mixing these particles with epoxy resin and hardener: quasi-reference and all-solid-state containing salts of alkaline or alkaline earth metals. All-solid-state <b>reference</b> <b>electrodes</b> can be sterilized with high-pressure saturated steam at 394. 15 K (121 °C) using an autoclave. These electrodes presented a stable potential between pH 2 and 11. The electrode surface {{was characterized by}} scanning electron microscopy and showed the presence of silver and salt particles.

40|$|It is now {{fairly well}} {{established}} that the steel reinforcement bars (rebars) embedded in reinforced concrete bridges and structures can undergo electrochemical corrosion under aggressive marine and or industrial environments and suffer premature deterioration. More recently, {{quite a number of}} electrochemical techniques have been adopted for monitoring the corrosion of embedded steel reinforcement. Apart from monitoring corrosion, control of reinforcement corrosion has assumed considerable significance and cathodic protection of reinforced concrete bridges and structures is rapidly gaining ground as a foolproof technology. In all these cases accurate measurement of rebar potential is an essential requirement. Experiences have shown that surface mounted <b>reference</b> <b>electrodes</b> may often lead to misleading data and embedded <b>reference</b> <b>electrodes</b> close to embedded steel reinforcement may aviod unpredictable ohmic resistance in concrete and give reliable data on the electrochemical behaviour.

25|$|Jaroslav Heyrovský, a Nobel laureate, {{eliminated}} the tedious weighing required by previous analytical techniques, which used the differential precipitation of mercury by measuring drop-time. In the previous method, a voltage {{was applied to}} a dropping mercury electrode and a <b>reference</b> <b>electrode</b> was immersed in a test solution. After 50 drops of mercury were collected, they were dried and weighed. The applied voltage was varied and the experiment repeated. Measured weight was plotted versus applied voltage to obtain the curve. In 1921, Heyrovský had the idea of measuring the current flowing through the cell instead of just studying drop-time.|$|E
25|$|As used by fumigators {{to detect}} {{hydrogen}} cyanide, copper(II) salt and an aromatic amine such as benzidine {{is added to}} the sample; as an alternative to benzidine an alternative amine di-(4,4-bis-dimethylaminophenyl) methane can be used. A positive test gives a blue color. Copper(I) cyanide is poorly soluble. By sequestering the copper(I) the copper(II) is rendered a stronger oxidant. The copper, in a cyanide facilitated oxidation, converts the amine into a colored compound. The Nernst equation explains this process. Another good example of such chemistry {{is the way in which}} the saturated calomel <b>reference</b> <b>electrode</b> (SCE) works. The copper, in a cyanide-facilitated oxidation, converts the amine into a colored compound.|$|E
