50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was developed}} into a major base used by both the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy units in the Vogelkop Peninsula, staging to other airfields to the south Aru and Kai Islands or east to New Guinea. The Japanese built a second 'hardtop' runway creating two strips of 4,530' and 2,660' respectively. Naval troops constructed 15 bomber and 24 fighter <b>revetments</b> <b>with</b> more under construction. The base largely escaped any Allied bombing until mid-1943.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSurface {{roughness}} {{plays an}} important role in manufacturing process and is a factor of great importance in the evaluation of cutting performance. Performance parameters such as cutting force, cutting temperature, acoustic emission signals etc. can be used to predict surface roughness. It is expected that more accurate prediction would be possible if these factors are considered collectively <b>with</b> <b>cutting</b> parameters since each of these factors predict surface roughness in their own characteristic fashion. In this present work, an attempt was made to fuse <b>cutting</b> temperature along <b>with</b> <b>cutting</b> parameters to predict surface roughness during turning of H 13 tool steel having a hardness of 43 HRC. An artificial neural network model was developed exclusively <b>with</b> <b>cutting</b> parameters then it was compared with another ANN model developed by fusing <b>cutting</b> temperature <b>with</b> <b>cutting</b> parameters and their ability to predict surface roughness (Ra) was analyzed. The fusion model developed based on the artificial neural network was found to be superior to ANN model without sensor fusion...|$|R

It could be applied as various structures, such as jetty, submerged breakwater, or <b>revetment</b> <b>with</b> beneficial features of easy installation, eco-friendliness and cost-effectiveness. The application of this method is boomed in recent years. And this project is located at Al Aqah Beach Fujairah, UAE. Existing rubble groins were lacked of substantial protection and weakened gradually. Serious erosion problem was found after Hurricane Gonu. This disaster affected the local tourism industry significantly. Taking tourist attractions, project budget, and environmental demands into consideration, the client chose geotextile tubes to rebuild the groin and submerged breakwater to achieve the purpose of beach nourishment.

40|$|Abstract. In {{orthopedic}} surgery, {{it is easy}} to do harm to surrounding tissues, so {{the study}} of bone cutting is necessary. In this article, a finite element model (FEM) of orthogonal bone cutting is developed. Cutting force intra-operatively can provide the surgeon with additional on-line information to support him to control quality of cutting surface. The obtained cutting force decreased little <b>with</b> <b>cutting</b> speed increasing, but ascended evidently <b>with</b> <b>cutting</b> depth increasing. The results of finite element simulations are aimed at providing optimization of cutting parameters and the basic information for hybrid force-velocity control of a robot-assisted bone milling system...|$|R
