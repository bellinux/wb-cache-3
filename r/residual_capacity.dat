5|$|Pulmonary plethysmographs {{are used}} to measure {{functional}} <b>residual</b> <b>capacity.</b> Functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> cannot be measured by tests that rely on breathing out, as a person is only able to breathe a maximum of 80% of their total functional capacity. The total lung capacity depends on the person's age, height, weight, and sex, and normally ranges between 4 and 6 litres. Females {{tend to have a}} 20–25% lower capacity than males. Tall people tend to have a larger total lung capacity than shorter people. Smokers have a lower capacity than nonsmokers. Thinner persons tend to have a larger capacity, and capacity can be increased by physical training as much as 40%.|$|E
25|$|Not {{all the air}} in {{the lungs}} can be {{expelled}} during maximally forced exhalation. This is the residual volume of about 1.0-1.5liters which cannot be measured by spirometry. Volumes that include the residual volume (i.e. functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> of about 2.5-3.0liters, and total lung capacity of about 6liters) can therefore also not be measured by spirometry. Their measurement requires special techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{volume of}} air that moves {{in or out}} (at the nose or mouth) during a single {{breathing}} cycle is called the tidal volume. In a resting adult human it is about 500ml per breath. At the end of exhalation the airways contain about 150ml of alveolar air {{which is the first}} air that is breathed back into the alveoli during inhalation. This volume air that is breathed out of the alveoli and back in again is known as dead space ventilation, which has the consequence that of the 500ml breathed into the alveoli with each breath only 350ml (500ml - 150ml = 350ml) is fresh warm and moistened air. Since this 350ml of fresh air is thoroughly mixed and diluted by the air that remains in the alveoli after normal exhalation (i.e. the functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> of about 2.5–3.0liters), {{it is clear that the}} composition of the alveolar air changes very little during the breathing cycle (see Fig. 9). The oxygen tension (or partial pressure) remains close to 13-14kPa (about 100mmHg), and that of carbon dioxide very close to 5.3kPa (or 40mmHg). This contrasts with composition of the dry outside air at sea level, where the partial pressure of oxygen is 21kPa (or 160mmHg) and that of carbon dioxide 0.04kPa (or 0.3mmHg).|$|E

500|$|Pulmonary {{contusion}} usually resolves itself {{without causing}} permanent complications; however {{it may also}} have long-term ill effects on respiratory function. Most contusions resolve in five to sevendays after the injury. [...] Signs detectable by radiography are usually gone within 10days after the injury—when they are not, other conditions, such as pneumonia, are the likely cause. [...] Chronic lung disease correlates {{with the size of}} the contusion and can interfere with an individual's ability to return to work. Fibrosis of the lungs can occur, resulting in dyspnea (shortness of breath), low blood oxygenation, and reduced functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> for as long as six years after the injury. As late as four years post-injury, decreased functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> has been found in most pulmonary contusion patients studied. During the six months after pulmonary contusion, up to 90% of people suffer difficulty breathing. In some cases, dyspnea persists for an indefinite period. [...] Contusion can also permanently reduce the compliance of the lungs.|$|E
500|$|The lungs are {{not capable}} of {{expanding}} themselves, and will only do so {{when there is an}} increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity. This is achieved by the muscles of respiration, through the contraction of the diaphragm, and the intercostal muscles which pull the rib cage upwards as shown in the diagram. During breathing out, at rest, the muscles of inhalation relax, returning the chest and abdomen to a resting position determined by their anatomical elasticity. At this point the lungs contain the functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> (FRC) of air, which, in the adult human, has a volume of about 2.5–3.0 litres.|$|E
500|$|During heavy {{breathing}} as, for instance, during exercise, {{a large number}} of accessory muscles in the neck and abdomen are recruited. Exhalation, instead of being passive, is now caused by the rib cage being actively pulled downwards at the front and sides by the abdominal muscles. This has the effect of decreasing the size of the rib cage, and of pushing the abdominal organs up against the diaphragm which bulges into the thorax. The lung volume of air at the end of exhalation is now less than the resting FRC. However, the lungs cannot be emptied completely and in an adult human there is always still at least one litre of residual air left in the lungs after maximum exhalation. The FRC always remains in the alveoli after a normal out-breath. With each breath only about 350ml (i.e. less than 15%) of this alveolar air is expelled into the ambient air (with about 150ml [...] remaining behind in the airways, as [...] "dead space" [...] ventilation, as it is the first air to re-enter the alveoli on inhalation). This is immediately replaced with the same volume of fresh, but moistened, atmospheric air. It is therefore obvious that the 350ml inhaled fresh air is highly diluted by the 3litres of functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> air (i.e. the air that remains in the lungs after a normal exhalation), and that the composition of the alveolar air therefore changes very little under normal circumstances: the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen remains very close to 14kPa (105mmHg), and that of carbon dioxide varies minimally around 5.3kPa (40mmHg) throughout the respiratory cycle (of inhalation and exhalation).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Two {{specimen}} series [limited seismic (LS) and nonseismic (NS) ] {{were subjected}} to quasistatic loadings to evaluate the <b>residual</b> axial <b>capacity</b> of blast-damaged reinforced concrete (RC) columns. A validated numerical model was used to predict the residual lateral deflection of RC columns subjected to an explosive attack. Three hydraulic actuators were installed horizontally to reproduce the target residual lateral deflection as predicted through this numerical model. Another two hydraulic actuators were installed vertically to apply the axial load and measure the <b>residual</b> axial <b>capacity</b> of the damaged columns. The effects of parameters such as axial loading and the transverse reinforcement ratio are investigated through this study. The results obtained from the experimental study showed the improved performance that LS detailing provided to RC columns to resist blast or lateral loads. This subsequently led columns detailed with a higher transverse reinforcement ratio to have an increased <b>residual</b> axial <b>capacity</b> when laterally damaged, {{as compared with the}} NS detailed spec-imens. Axial load (service load) on the columns was also found to affect the residual deflection profile and <b>residual</b> axial <b>capacity</b> of the columns after the specified blast event.

2500|$|This marked {{difference}} between {{the composition of the}} alveolar air and that of the ambient air can be maintained because the functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> is contained in dead-end sacs connected to the outside air by fairly narrow and relatively long tubes (the airways: nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi and their branches down to the bronchioles), through which the air has to be breathed both in and out (i.e. there is no unidirectional through-flow as there is in the bird lung). This typical mammalian anatomy combined {{with the fact that the}} lungs are not emptied and re-inflated with each breath (leaving a substantial volume of air, of about 2.5-3.0liters, in the alveoli after exhalation), ensures that the composition of the alveolar air is only minimally disturbed when the 350ml of fresh air is mixed into it with each inhalation. Thus the animal is provided with a very special [...] "portable atmosphere", whose composition differs significantly from the present-day ambient air.

In this paper, we revisit the problem of achieving network energy efficiency in data centers and identify some new optimization challenges under the NaaS model. Particularly, we extend the energy-efficient routing optimization from single-resource to multi-resource settings. We characterize the problem through a detailed model and provide a formal problem definition. Due to the high complexity of direct solutions, we propose a greedy routing scheme to approximate the optimum, where flows are selected progressively to exhaust <b>residual</b> <b>capacities</b> of active nodes, and routing paths are assigned based on the distributions of both node <b>residual</b> <b>capacities</b> and flow demands. By leveraging the structural regularity of data center networks, we also provide a fast topology-aware heuristic method based on hierarchically solving a series of vector bin packing instances. Our simulations show that the proposed routing scheme can achieve significant gain on energy savings and the topology-aware heuristic can produce comparably good results while reducing the computation time to a large extent.

When this route is damaged in man, apparent blindness in a corresponding part of the visual field occurs, despite the integrity of the other parallel pathways. In animals, it has been demonstrated by conventional behavioural forced-choice techniques that extrastriate routes can sustain a variety of visual discriminations. Comparable discriminations are also possible in some human subjects with geniculo-striate damage when forced-choice 'guessing' techniques are used. 'Blind-sight' refers to those subjects who state that they are unaware of the visual stimuli, even when performing discriminations at high levels of proficiency. Extensions of this approach are reviewed, especially to spectral sensitivity and movement discrimination. But <b>residual</b> <b>capacities</b> can also be assessed without requiring guessing responses, thereby avoiding issues of differential response criteria and other practical difficulties. Effects of 'unseen' stimuli in the cortically blind field on the visible perception of concurrent stimuli in the intact field can be measured. Also, positive reactions of the autonomic nervous system, such as the galvanic skin response, can be recorded to visual stimuli presented in the blind field. Recent evidence demonstrates that the pupil in normal adult subjects is systematically sensitive to structural and chromatic features of visual stimuli. Pupillometry reveals specific changes and <b>residual</b> <b>capacities</b> in visual-field defects of adult patients with striate cortical damage.
