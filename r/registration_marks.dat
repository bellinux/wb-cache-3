50|$|A special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> {{obtained}} in an auction is not transferable, {{that is to}} say, the number can be used only on vehicles registered {{under the name of}} the buyer. Transferring a special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> from one vehicle to another is permitted provided that they are both owned by the same person. Sale or transfer of vehicles bearing a special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> to someone else would lose that special <b>registration</b> <b>mark.</b> If the buyer is assigned the special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> to a vehicle, and later dies, the special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> cannot be transferred together with the vehicle to his heirs. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} consider in whose name one should buy a special <b>registration</b> <b>mark</b> in an auction. The use of a limited liability company as the buyer gets around the non-transferrable restriction because of its perpetual succession and the ability to transfer the company shares.|$|R

500|$|In his drawing, McCay made bold, prodigious use {{of linear}} perspective, {{particularly}} in detailed architecture and cityscapes. [...] He textured his editorial cartoons with copious fine hatching, and made color a central element in Little Nemo. [...] His comic strip work has influenced generations of cartoonists and illustrators. [...] The technical level of McCay's animation—its naturalism, smoothness, and scale—was unmatched until Walt Disney's feature films {{arrived in the}} 1930s. [...] He pioneered inbetweening, the use of <b>registration</b> <b>marks,</b> cycling, and other animation techniques that were to become standard.|$|E
500|$|Gertie was McCay's {{first piece}} of {{animation}} with detailed backgrounds. [...] Main production began in mid-1913. [...] Working in his spare time, McCay drew thousands of frames of Gertie on [...] sheets [...] of rice paper, a medium good for drawing as it did not absorb ink, and as it was translucent it was ideal for the laborious retracing of backgrounds, a job that fell to art student neighbor John A. Fitzsimmons. [...] The drawings themselves occupied a [...] area of the paper, marked with <b>registration</b> <b>marks</b> in the corners to reduce jittering of the images when filmed. [...] They were photographed mounted on large pieces of stiff cardboard.|$|E
500|$|While colour {{printing}} in Japan {{dates to the}} 1640s, early ukiyo-e prints used only black ink. [...] Colour was sometimes added by hand, using a red lead ink in tan-e prints, or later in a pink safflower ink in beni-e prints. [...] Colour printing arrived in books in the 1720s and in single-sheet prints in the 1740s, with a different block and printing for each colour. [...] Early colours were limited to pink and green; techniques expanded over the following two decades to allow up to five colours. [...] The mid-1760s brought full-colour nishiki-e prints made from ten or more woodblocks. [...] To keep the blocks for each colour aligned correctly <b>registration</b> <b>marks</b> called kentō were placed on one corner and an adjacent side.|$|E

500|$|Gertie was McCay's {{first piece}} of {{animation}} with detailed backgrounds. [...] McCay drew the foreground characters, while art student neighbor John A. Fitzsimmons traced the backgrounds. [...] McCay pioneered the [...] "McCay Split System" [...] of inbetweening, in which major poses or positions were drawn first, and the intervening frames drawn after. [...] This relieved tedium and improved {{the timing of the}} film's actions. [...] McCay refused to patent his system, and was sued in 1914 by animator John Randolph Bray, who took advantage of McCay's lapse by patenting many of McCay's techniques, including the use of <b>registration</b> <b>marks,</b> tracing paper, the Mutoscope action viewer, and the cycling of drawings to create repetitive action. [...] The lawsuit was unsuccessful, and there is evidence that McCay may have countersued — he thereafter received royalty payments from Bray for licensing the techniques.|$|E
500|$|Although Gertie is popularly {{thought to}} be the {{earliest}} animated film, McCay had earlier made Little Nemo(1911) and How a Mosquito Operates(1912). The American J. Stuart Blackton and the French Émile Cohl had experimented with animation even earlier; Gertie being a character with an appealing personality distinguished McCay's film from these earlier [...] "trick films". [...] Gertie was the first film to use animation techniques such as keyframes, <b>registration</b> <b>marks,</b> tracing paper, the Mutoscope action viewer, and animation loops. [...] It influenced the next generation of animators such as the Fleischer brothers, Otto Messmer, Paul Terry, and Walt Disney. [...] John Randolph Bray unsuccessfully tried to patent many of McCay's animation techniques and {{is said to have been}} behind a plagiarized version of Gertie that appeared a year or two after the original. [...] Gertie is the best preserved of McCay's films—some of which have been lost or survive only in fragments—and has been preserved in the U.S. Library of Congress' National Film Registry as being [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".|$|E
500|$|McCay {{pioneered the}} [...] "McCay Split System" [...] of animation, in which major poses or {{positions}} were drawn {{first and the}} intervening frames drawn after. [...] This relieved tedium and improved {{the timing of the}} film's actions. [...] McCay was open about the techniques that he developed, and refused to patent his system, reportedly saying, [...] "Any idiot that wants to make a couple of thousand drawings for a hundred feet of film is welcome to join the club." [...] During production of Gertie, he showed the details to a visitor who claimed to be writing an article about animation. The visitor was animator John Randolph Bray, who sued McCay in 1914 after taking advantage of McCay's lapse to patent many of the techniques, including the use of <b>registration</b> <b>marks,</b> tracing paper, and the Mutoscope action viewer, and the cycling of drawings to create repetitive action. [...] The suit was unsuccessful, and there is evidence that McCay may have countersued—he received royalty payments from Bray for licensing the techniques.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the end of}} the First World War the Air Navigation Regulations {{came into}} force on 20 April 1919, {{allowing}} civil flying to commence on 1 May 1919. The regulation stated that all aircraft must carry <b>registration</b> <b>marks</b> and any passenger-carrying aircraft must have a certificate of airworthiness. The International Air Navigation Conference in Paris had not concluded, so a temporary system was started; former military aircraft would retain military serials and any new or re-built aircraft would be registered in a sequence starting with K-100. The first civil flight under the new regulations took place on 1 May 1919 when a de Havilland DH.9 of Aircraft Transport and Travel flew from Hounslow to Bournemouth using former military serial C6054 as an identity. The [...] "K series" [...] registrations allocated were in the range K-100 to K-175, with K-169 being the highest known to have been used.|$|E
