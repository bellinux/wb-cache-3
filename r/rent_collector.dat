25|$|He {{responded to}} these criticisms by attacking his detractors {{in the pages}} of Murray's Magazine, {{supporting}} vigilante activity, which the police on the streets knew was a bad idea, and publicly complaining about his lack of control of CID, which brought an official Home Office reprimand for discussing his office publicly without permission. Warren finally had enough and resigned – coincidentally right before the murder of Mary Jane Kelly on 9 November 1888. Every superintendent on the force visited him at home to express their regret. Warren's resignation hindered the investigation. He had given an order that if another murder occurred, nobody was to enter the scene – a strange turn of phrase as the four previous victims had all been found in the open street – until he arrived to direct the investigation. Consequently, when the murder of Kelly was discovered by a <b>rent</b> <b>collector</b> who looked in through the window of her room in a Spitalfields lodging house, the police did not enter the room for some three hours because, unaware of his resignation, they were waiting for Warren to arrive. He returned to military duties.|$|E
500|$|Ranulf's {{reputation}} {{has suffered}} {{because of the}} hostility of the monastic chroniclers to both himself and to Rufus. Many chroniclers decried his financial ruthlessness and his lax morals. Orderic described Ranulf's career as [...] "addicted to feasts and carousals and lusts; cruel and ambitious, prodigal to his own adherents, but rapacious in seizing the goods of other men". Besides the chroniclers, Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury wrote to Pope Paschal II, while Ranulf was in exile, describing Ranulf as [...] "a <b>rent</b> <b>collector</b> of the worst possible reputation." [...] William of Malmesbury said that Flambard was a [...] "plunderer of the rich, destroyer of the poor". Victorian historians, including E. A. Freeman, vilified Ranulf, and Freeman especially held that Ranulf was a [...] "malignant genius". Modern historians have embraced a more moderate view, starting with Richard Southern in 1933. The historian David Bates felt that he, along with his successor Roger of Salisbury, [...] "were essentially the chief managers of the king's finance and justice".|$|E

50|$|Following Octavia Hill's {{principles}} of female residence managers, the company employed female <b>rent</b> <b>collectors</b> including Beatrice Potter (later Webb, {{co-founder of the}} London School of Economics) and Ella Pycroft. The company built {{a large number of}} dwellings in what is now the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, starting with Katharine Buildings in 1885.|$|R
500|$|The {{number of}} homes managed by Hill {{continued}} to grow. Although Ruskin had turned against {{her in a}} bout of mental instability, she found a new supporter, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, who handed over to her the management of their housing estates in several poor areas of south London. By {{the end of the}} nineteenth century, Hill's women workers were no longer unpaid volunteers but trained professionals. Hill's influence spread beyond the properties under her own control. Her ideas were taken up and copied, with her enthusiastic support, in continental Europe and the United States of America. Beatrice Webb said that she [...] "first became aware of the meaning of the poverty of the poor," [...] while staying with her sister, who was a <b>rent</b> <b>collector</b> for Octavia Hill in the East End. Queen Victoria's daughter, Princess Alice of Hesse-Darmstadt, was taken incognito on a tour of some of Hill's properties, and she translated Hill's Homes of the London Poor into German. Among those whom Hill trained was her assistant and secretary, Maud Jeffery, who was later engaged by the Commissioners of Crown Lands to run new housing estates in London on Octavia Hill's lines. Even some local authorities, despite Hill's distrust, followed her model: [...] some of the earliest examples of municipal council housing, at Kensington and Camberwell, were run on her lines, with the acquisition of working class houses, and their gradual improvement, without evictions or demolitions.|$|E
2500|$|Novello {{was born}} in Cardiff, Wales, to David Davies (c. 1852–1931), a <b>rent</b> <b>collector</b> for the city council, and his wife, Clara Novello Davies, an internationally known singing teacher and choral conductor. As a boy, Novello was a {{successful}} singer in the Welsh Eisteddfod. His mother set up as voice teacher in London, where he met leading performers, including members of George Edwardes's Gaiety Theatre company, classical musicians such as Landon Ronald, and singers such as Adelina Patti. Another of his mother's associates was Clara Butt, who taught him to sing [...] "Abide with Me" [...] {{when he was a}} boy of six.|$|E

Widowed and with an infant on his hands at twenty-three, Kedarnath soon married Bhagavati Devi, a daughter of Gangamoy Roy of Jakpore, who would become his lifelong companion and the mother of his other thirteen children. [...] After a short tenure at a lucrative position as the head clerk at the Bardhaman revenue collector's office, Kedarnath felt morally compromised as well as insecure with the position of a <b>rent</b> <b>collector,</b> settling for a less profitable but more agreeable occupation as a clerk elsewhere.|$|E

50|$|Panama law {{defines a}} real estate broker as one who professionally and habitually {{operates}} as an agent, intermediary, mediator, or representative in real estate transactions.

Because of these exceptions, many foreigners work as promoters for Panam{{a real estate}} companies.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{collective}} economy, individual economy turned as well. On one hand villagers’ income increased tremendously {{due to the}} opening of marketing price; on the other hand, since urbanization struck the city, to which more and more people flooded, villagers raised their income as capital to rebuild their own houses for rent, which ended the era of tilling. Most of villagers are now <b>rent</b> <b>collectors,</b> {{and some of them are}} doing other business as well.|$|R
2500|$|Over the {{following}} fifteen years back yards and other open spaces were built upon with shanty-style developments, creating illegal courts, small houses, workshops, stables, cowsheds and donkey stalls. As surveyors and cartographers {{struggled to keep}} accurate maps of the Old Nichol, the already high population density increased further. Families {{with more than one}} child often lied to be able to obtain a room and were thrown out if the <b>rent</b> <b>collector</b> or landlord found out that more than one child lived with family in one room. Monday was rent day, known as [...] "Black Monday", and in the Old Nichol women would form queues outside the pawnshops with their belongings. The rent was collected by house agents who would evict tenants if the rent was in arrears [...] In 1863 The Builder reported of the Old Nichol that: ...|$|E
2500|$|Italians {{were also}} among the early {{settlers}} of Ybor City. Most of them came from a few villages in southwestern Sicily. The villages were Santo Stefano Quisquina, Alessandria della Rocca, Bivona, Cianciana, and Contessa Entellina. Sixty percent of them came from Santo Stefano Quisquina. Before settling in Ybor City, many first worked in the sugar cane plantations in St. Cloud, central Florida. Some came by way of Louisiana. A number of families migrated from New Orleans after the lynching of eleven Italians in 1891 during the “Mafia Riot.” Italians mostly brought their entire families with them, unlike other immigrants. The foreign-born Italian population of Tampa grew from 56 in 1890 to 2,684 in 1940. Once arriving in Ybor City, Italians settled mainly in the eastern and southern fringes of the city. The area {{was referred to as}} La Pachata, after a Cuban <b>rent</b> <b>collector</b> in that area. It was also called “Little Italy.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{half of the}} {{properties}} in the Old Nichol were managed by solicitors and other trustees to benefit estates of the long deceased. Two of the largest Old Nichol holdings, the Gwatkin Estate and the Wolley Estate, including about 297 houses, were managed partly on behalf of phantoms. Several of the Old Nichol estates were the subject of long-running Court of Chancery cases. There were rumours that {{the owners of the}} freeholds and leaseholds included peers of the realm, churchmen, Bethnal Green vestrymen and several dead people. One investigation into the housing conditions in the Old Nichol at the time found that many tenants had huge difficulties finding out who their landlords really were: [...] "Their rent books contain only the names of the tenants, the amounts and the dates of payment, and the initials of the <b>rent</b> <b>collector...</b> The collectors are often merely agents' clerks. Sometimes the persons for whom the collectors act are only farmers of the rent; and they not only bully the tenants, but often take the law into their own hands, and turn the people into the street without legal warrant of any kind.|$|E
50|$|Under the British occupation, {{the land}} system in India has been feudalic, with few {{absentee}} landlords holding {{most of the}} lands and claiming high rents from poor peasants. The demand for a land reform was a major theme in the demand for independence. After independence, the different states in India gradually started a land reform process in four main categories: abolition of intermediaries (<b>rent</b> <b>collectors</b> under the pre-Independence land revenue system); tenancy regulation (to improve the contractual terms including security of tenure); a ceiling on landholdings (to redistribute surplus land to the landless); and attempts to consolidate disparate landholdings. The extent and success of these reforms varied greatly between the different states of India.|$|R

40|$|In Egypt, state {{formation}} occurred {{much more}} rapidly after {{the adoption of}} farming than in {{many other parts of}} the ancient Near East. Furthermore, the Egyptian state lasted longer and was more stable than most Empires established elsewhere. This paper argues that successful states in the ancient world depended on the ability of elites to extract a surplus from farmers and other producers. This ability was greatest when the population was immobile. The success of the Pharaohs was due to the geography of Egypt [...] the deserts bordering the Nile meant that habitation was confined to the valley. Farmers could flee tax or <b>rent</b> <b>collectors</b> only along the river.

50|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{coronation}} the new Chogyal appointed 12 kalons or ministers from the Bhutia community and split his kingdom into 12 Dzongs or administrative units, which each contained a fort. Individual Dzongs were {{headed by a}} Dzonga drawn from amongst the Lepchas. The lands of Sikkim were leased as gifts to kazis and thikadars who in turn leased sub-plots to peasants at high rents. Mandals (headmen) and karbaris (assistants to the mandals) were employed by the kazis and thikadars as <b>rent</b> <b>collectors</b> and dispute mediators. Out of Sikkims 104 revenue estates, 61 were leased to kazis and thikadars for fixed sums, five were given to monasteries and fifteen retained by the Chogyal for his private use. The Limbu chiefs or the Subbas were also given full autonomy of their districts under the King.|$|R

Although the estate regulations stipulated that the gardens must be maintained in order, more than a few degenerated into virtual jungles. However, to encourage the application of this rule, prizes were awarded for the best kept gardens. Initial candidates were selected by the <b>rent</b> <b>collectors</b> during their weekly rounds and a committee decided on the final prizes which ranged from ten shillings consolation prizes up to £20 (an average week's rent in 1953 was about £1 18/- (£1.90)) for the first prize in each ward, plus a notice placed in the centre of the lawn for the benefit of passers-by.|$|R

5000|$|In 1657, {{during the}} rule of the mughal emperor Jahangir, Banku Bihari's son Abu Ray was {{appointed}} the officer in charge of revenue collection and of the maintenance of public order in two precincts (Rekabi Bazar and Mughultuli) of Burdwan district. He owed this appointment to his ability to supply the army passing through Burdwan with adequate provisions at short notice. The family continued to flourish in trade, and Abu Ray's son Babu Ray added further to the prestige of the family by acquiring large estates. He purchased Burdwan and three other estates from Ram Ray, an important Zamindar of the area. His grandson Krishnaram Ray, son of Ghanashyam Ray, obtained letters patent from Aurangzeb in 1689 A.D., recognizing him as Zamindar of these estates and extending to Burdwan and some other areas the offices already held by the family in Rekabi Bazar and Mughultuli. The family thus entered the ranks of the nobility. Krishnaram Ray was ordered to not realize any new taxes from the peasantry but to encourage cultivation and maintain law and order. The nazarana for the land was set at Rs. 200,000/-. Zamindars are {{not to be confused with}} Indian royalty. The [...] "Mahrajas" [...] of Burdwan were basically large <b>rent</b> <b>collectors</b> for the British having bought this privilege at auction during the Permanent Settlement of Bengal; they were never members of the Chamber of Princes and had no treaties with the British Government. The lands that they collected rents from were directly administered by Indian Civil Service officers who themselves were part of the Bengal Presidency and later the State of Bengal. Thus Raja and Maharaja were titles that in many cases such as here had no reference to sovereignty. Nor were the [...] "Maharajas of Burdwan" [...] aristocrats in any sense of the word. They, however were extremely wealthy businessmen.|$|R
