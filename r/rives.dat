5|$|Tyler's {{successor}} in the Senate was William Cabell <b>Rives,</b> {{a conservative}} Democrat. In February 1839, the General Assembly considered who should fill that seat, {{which was to}} expire the following month. <b>Rives</b> had drifted away from his party, signalling a possible alliance with the Whigs. As Tyler had already fully rejected the Democrats, he expected the Whigs would support him. Still, many Whigs found <b>Rives</b> a more politically expedient choice, as they hoped to ally with the conservative wing of the Democratic Party in the 1840 presidential election. This strategy was supported by Whig leader Henry Clay, who nevertheless admired Tyler at that time. With the vote split among three candidates, including <b>Rives</b> and Tyler, the Senate seat remained vacant for almost two years, until January 1841.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Pierre <b>Rives</b> (born 1952), a 1997 inductee of the International Hall {{who entered}} the World Rugby Hall with the merger, played 59 tests for France between 1975 and 1984; {{including}} 34 as captain. He played in Five Nations Grand Slams in 1977 and 1981, and captained France to their first ever win over the All Blacks in New Zealand. <b>Rives</b> is now a sculptor, and designed the Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy (Italian: Trofeo Garibaldi; French: Trophée Garibaldi), which is competed for every year by France and Italy in the 6 Nations championship.|$|E

The material all went to the Musee des Dinosaures, and together took about 10 years to assemble.|$|E

5|$|Tennessee's {{delegation}} did {{not attend}} the convention. Edward Rucker, a Tennessean who happened to be in Baltimore, was picked to cast its 15 votes, so that all the states would endorse Van Buren. Senator Silas Wright, of New York, prevailed upon Rucker to vote for Johnson, giving him just more than twice the votes cast for <b>Rives,</b> and the nomination.|$|E
5|$|Clay, though embittered {{by another}} of his many defeats for the presidency, was appeased by Tyler's {{withdrawal}} from the still-unresolved Senate race, which would permit the election of <b>Rives,</b> and campaigned in Virginia for the Harrison/Tyler ticket. Tyler predicted the Whigs would easily take Virginia; he was embarrassed when he was proved wrong, but was consoled by an overall victory—Harrison and Tyler won by an electoral vote of 234–60 and with 53 {{percent of the popular}} vote. Van Buren took only seven scattered states out of 26. The Whigs gained control of both houses of Congress.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1820s, Jean Baptiste <b>Rives,</b> a French {{adviser to the}} Hawaiian king KamehamehaII, {{traveled}} to Europe to attempt to convince European Catholics to organize a mission to Hawaii. Members of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary were receptive to his idea, and in 1825, Pope LeoXII assigned them the task of evangelizing Hawaii. Bachelot was appointed the Prefect Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands, and in this role led the first permanent mission to Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the individual military punishments, the army took further internal measures to {{lower the risk of}} another insurrection. According to Maurice <b>Rives,</b> 10,000 Vietnamese troops were given transfers to different zones. This meant that more than 80% of Tonkin's approximately 12,000 Tirailleurs Tonkinois were moved, a transfer of enormous proportions, indicating the extent of insecurity among French commanders towards Vietnamese troops, {{and the extent to which}} they were willing to go to make future Yen Bays impossible. One possible rationale for this measure was to break up any undiscovered VNQDĐ cells and to sever personal ties, within units and between soldiers and civilians in their local district. The mass transfer of soldiers also had the effect of creating a state of constant mobilisation, denying troops the time and opportunity for anti-colonial organisation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rive's</b> {{success was}} synonymous with speculations {{made on the}} club for debauchery and illegal activities. Most {{prominent}} was that of underage girls being allowed into the club every weekend. Other speculations of capacity violations, drugs, much sex in the private bathrooms by <b>Rive</b> patrons were also made, but no legal action was ever taken {{due to a lack}} of substantial evidence. To <b>Rive's</b> patrons, that is what made the club fun. They saw it as a place to go and do anything they want, no matter what morals tell them not to. In many ways, <b>Rive</b> was a modern-day Studio 54.|$|R
