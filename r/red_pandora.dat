5000|$|Pagellus bellottii, the <b>Red</b> <b>pandora,</b> is {{a species}} of fish found {{off the coast of}} Africa and the Canary Islands, from the western Mediterranean southwards to Angola. A {{demersal}} feeder, they can generally be found at depths of 10 m to 50 m. Individuals can reach 42 cm, but average 25 cm. It is a protogynic hermaphrodite; individuals start out life as females, and some become male later on.|$|E
40|$|Population {{parameters}} for <b>Red</b> <b>Pandora,</b> Pagellus bellottii (Steindachner, 1882) {{from the eastern}} coastline of Ghana, using length-frequency data from June 2014 to January 2015 were assessed. A total of 440 samples of Pagellus bellottii were measured for standard length and analyzed with FiSAT II. The asymptotic length (L∞) and growth rate (K) were 19. 43 cm and 0. 42 per year. Theoretical age at birth (t 0) and growth performance index (ϕ) were - 0. 44 per year and 2. 20. The age at first maturity (tm 50) and longevity (tmax) were 2. 2 years and 7 years. The Bhattacharya’s method revealed three modal lengths groups: 9. 3 cm, 12. 1 cm, and 14. 6 cm. Total mortality rate (Z), natural mortality rate (M) and fishing mortality rate (F) were 2. 58 per year, 1. 10 per year, and 1. 48 per year. Exploitation rate (Ecurrent) and maximum exploitation rate (Emax) were estimated as 0. 57 and 0. 93 respectively. The recruitment pattern was continuous with two major recruitment pulses. VPA outcome showed that mid- lengths of 11. 5 cm and 12. 5 cm experienced the highest harvesting rate. The fishing regime of Pagellus bellottii fell in the developed stage based on the quadrant rule. Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) was 7864. 18 tons. Results from the study indicated the existence of growth overfishing with {{the present state of}} exploitation as a forewarning to the collapse of the fishery in future. With resilience of <b>Red</b> <b>pandora</b> within the medium category, incidence of overfishing will produce economic consequences. The developed stage of fishing suggested that maximization of yield per recruits will lead to low stock biomass of <b>Red</b> <b>pandora...</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>red</b> <b>pandora,</b> Pagellus bellottii Steindachner, 1882, is a {{tropical}} and subtropical demersal Sparidae (Porgies) that lives over hard or sandy bottoms in coastal marine waters. It mostly occurs at depths ranging from 10 to 50 metres. It is {{distributed in the}} eastern Atlantic, from the Strait of Gibraltar to Angola and the Canary Islands where it is occasionally recorded (Bauchot and Hureau, 1986; Franqueville, 1983). The species is also recorded in the southwestern Mediterranean, in the Alboran Sea, off the Algerian coasts and in the Gulf of Gabes (Oral, 2010). The records of the species in the eastern Mediterranean, Syrian and Israeli waters (Fricke, et al. 2014, Fig. 1) is questioned. We consider these records are misidentification of Pagrus pagrus (Linnaeus, 1758). Pagellus bellottii was {{also included in the}} checklist of the fishes from Portugal as a consequence of records coming from the Algarve region, about 36 ° 59 ′ N, 8 ° W, the northernmost records in Atlantic waters (de Castro, 1967; Erzini et al., 1996; Carneiro et al., 2014; Carneiro com. pers.). Some specimens were also recorded in Spanish Mediterranean waters, in the Bay of Almería about 36 ° 47 ′ N, 2 ° 25 ′ W (Lucena, et al. 1982), the northernmost records for the Mediterranean waters. Herein, the first record of P. bellottii in the Bay of Biscay is reported...|$|E
40|$|The {{conservation}} and management of tropical deer populations need both knowledge of the ecology and natural history of deer {{and an understanding of}} the utilization of deer populations by humans. The south-eastern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico is the region with the largest ungulate diversity in Mesoamerica, including three of the five species of deer found in Mexico. For centuries, human populations have been harvesting deer for subsistence in this region. Little is know on the ecology and conservation of ungulate populations undergoing subsistence harvesting in Mesamerica. This thesis {{is the result of a}} long-term study (1996 - 2001) on the population, community ecology and sustainable management of the Yucatan Peninsula brown brocket deer (Mazama <b>pandora),</b> <b>red</b> brocket deer (Mazama americana) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the Greater Calakmul Region՝ (GCR), south eastern Mexico. Chapter two addresses the estimation of deer abundance, densities, population structure and habitat use of sympatric populations of these three species of deer. Chapter three outlines the relationships of the deer diet with aspects of habitat ecology such as fruit phenology, availability and seasonality. Chapter four describes the spatial and temporal patterns of subsistence hunting of tropical deer populations with the use of a novel technique incorporating both GIS/GPS technologies and participatory research. The abundance of deer in the GCR remained stable during a continuous monitoring period of five years and no effects of hunting were detected in the populations of the two Mazama species. A steady decline was detected in the populations of white-tailed deer that might be attributed to over-harvesting by subsistence hunters. Densities of the three species of deer are similar or higher that those reported elsewhere in the Neotropics. Mazama americana presented strong preferences in habitat use for the Tall Perennial Forest, while M pandora and o. virginianus used habitats in relation with availability. The population structure of the three species of deer resembles a stable population with the majority of individuals found in younger age classes but older individuals still found in ages above 12 years old (the cementum annuli technique for age determination was used for the first time in a tropical deer population). Mazama americana is a frugivore deer with its diet composed of up to 80 % fruits year-round, while M. pandora and o. virginianus are both frugivores and browsers. Fruit availability for deer was strongly linked with fruit phonological patterns of the major planit species composing the deer diet year-round. A critical period with low fruit availability and potential dietary stress for deer was found during the dry season (April-May). The Zapote tree {Manilkara zapota) might be a keystone plant resource in the region. Subsistence hunting of deer is widespread in the GCR region, but deer hunting seems to be sustainable in part due to the dynamic patterns in spatial and temporal location of hunters in the landscape. The spatial and temporal patterns of deer hunting might be responsible for the creation of natural refuges and source/sink areas for deer populations. The {{conservation and}} management of tropical deer populations in the GCR and Meso-America are discussed in the light of these findings.
