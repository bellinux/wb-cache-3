The deal includes that Parliament's President will attend high level Commission meetings. Parliament will have a seat in the EU's Commission-lead international negotiations and have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>information</b> on agreements. However, Parliament secured only an observer seat. Parliament also did not secure a say over the appointment of delegation heads and special representatives for foreign policy. Although they will appear before parliament after they have been appointed by the High Representative. One major internal power was that Parliament wanted a pledge from the Commission that it would put forward legislation when parliament requests.

40|$|Before the {{development}} of access <b>to</b> <b>information</b> legislation, government information was not generally available to the public. While the emergence of access <b>to</b> <b>information</b> legislation in Canadian jurisdictions reflected important public policy decisions that providing access <b>to</b> <b>information</b> promotes good government, the courts had always recognized {{that there was no}} constitutional <b>right</b> <b>to</b> require the government <b>to</b> disclose <b>information</b> in its possession. In Criminal Lawyers’ Assn. v. Ontario (Ministry of Public Safety and Security) the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously reached the novel conclusion that the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> freedom of <b>information</b> protected by section 2 (b) of the Charter contained, in limited circumstances, a derivative <b>right</b> <b>to</b> government <b>information.</b> The new <b>right</b> <b>to</b> government <b>information</b> recognized by the Court is an extremely narrow <b>right,</b> limited <b>to</b> situations “where access is necessary to permit meaningful discussion on a matter of public importance, subject to privileges and functional constraints”.

25|$|During {{its first}} term in office, the UPA {{government}} passed several social reform bills. These included an employment guarantee bill, the <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Information</b> Act, and {{a right to}} education act. The NAC, {{as well as the}} Left Front that supported the government from the outside, were widely seen as being the driving force behind such legislation. The Left Front withdrew its support of the government over disagreements about the U.S.–India Civil Nuclear Agreement. Despite the effective loss of 62 seats in parliament, the government survived the trust vote that followed. In the Lok Sabha elections held soon after, the Congress won 207 seats, the highest tally of any party since 1991. The UPA as a whole won 262, enabling it to form the government for the second time. The social welfare policies of the first UPA government, and the perceived divisiveness of the BJP, are broadly credited for the victory.|$|E
25|$|PwC {{was found}} to be unethically favored by the World Bank in a bid to privatize the water {{distribution}} system of Delhi, India, an effort that was alleged as corrupt by investigators. When bidding took place, PwC repeatedly failed in each round, and the World Bank in each case pressured PwC to be pushed to the next round and eventually win the bid. The effort at privatization fell through when an investigation was conducted by Arvind Kejriwal and the non-governmental organization (NGO) Parivartan in 2005. After submitting a <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Information</b> (RTI) request, Parivartan received 9000 pages of correspondence and consultation with the World Bank, where it was revealed that the privatization of Delhi's water supply would provide salaries of $25,000 a month to four administrators of each of the 21 water zones, which amounted to over $25 million per year, increasing the budget by over 60% and water taxes 9 times.|$|E

The PIL filed against Rao declared that other Indian scientists, such as Homi Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai, had contributed more than Rao and his claim of publishing 1400 research papers was [...] "physically impossible". The suit stated that as Rao had proven cases of plagiarism, {{he should not be}} presented with the award but rather should be annulled. The PIL filed against Tendulkar to the Election Commission under the <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Information</b> Act indicated that the awarding him the Bharat Ratna was a violation of the model code of conduct. The petitioner noted that as Tendulkar was an Indian National Congress nominated Member of Rajya Sabha, the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna would influence the voters of Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Mizoram where the election process was underway at the time. Another PIL was filed against Tendulkar and a few ministers, [...] "alleging a conspiracy to ignore" [...] an Indian field hockey player Dhyan Chand." ...|$|E
