5000|$|Christian Hülsmeyer (Huelsmeyer) (25 December 1881 - 31 January 1957) was a German inventor, {{physicist}} and entrepreneur. He is often {{credited with the}} invention of <b>radar,</b> but his <b>apparatus,</b> called the [...] "Telemobiloscope," [...] could not directly measure distance to a target and thus does not merit this full distinction. The Telemobiloscope was, however, the first patented device using radio waves for detecting the presence of distant objects.|$|R
50|$|In September 1935, a {{demonstration}} {{was given to}} the Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine. The system performance was excellent; the range was read off the Braun tube with a tolerance of 50 meters (less than 1 percent variance), and the lobe switching allowed a directional accuracy of 0.1 degree. Historically, this marked the first naval vessel equipped with <b>radar.</b> Although this <b>apparatus</b> was not put into production, GEMA was funded to develop similar systems operating around 50 cm (500 MHz). These became the Seetakt for the Kriegsmarine and the Freya for the Luftwaffe (German Air Force).|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} system denoted a change-detection onboard processor (CDOP) {{is being developed}} {{as a means of}} processing the digitized output of a synthetic-aperture <b>radar</b> (SAR) <b>apparatus</b> aboard an aircraft or spacecraft to generate images showing changes that have occurred in the terrain below between repeat passes of the aircraft or spacecraft over the terrain. When fully developed, the CDOP is intended to be capable of generating SAR images and/or SAR differential interferograms in nearly real time. The CDOP is expected to be especially useful for understanding some large-scale natural phenomena and/or mitigating natural hazards: For example, it could be used for near-real-time observation of surface changes caused by floods, landslides, forest fires, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, glaciers, and sea ice movements. It could also be used to observe such longer-term surface changes as those associated with growth of vegetation (relevant to estimation of wildfire fuel loads). The CDOP is, essentially, an interferometric SAR processor designed to operate aboard a radar platform...|$|R
50|$|The Gibraltar Aerobeacon is a square, {{skeletal}} tower {{which features}} a large gallery platform on {{which there is a}} round <b>radar</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The light characteristic is remarkable for a red light which flashes the Morse Code for Gibraltar. It consists of two long flashes and a short flash, after which there is a long flash and three short flashes. The code for Gibraltar is emitted every ten seconds. The range is 30 nautical miles (55 kilometres or 34.5 miles). The active beacon has a focal plane (or focal height) of 405 metres (1329 feet).|$|E
50|$|The tower's height {{has some}} {{functional}} purpose, since its roof supports meteorological instruments and radio communications equipment, plus a white spherical radome enclosing long-distance weather <b>radar</b> <b>apparatus.</b> This technical equipment all requires a line-of-sight vantage point for optimum range and accuracy, {{and would have}} required construction {{of some kind of}} tower to function as intended. To minimize interference with radio signals, other buildings on MIT's central campus are less than half the height of the Green Building, and the dormitory towers of Eastgate, Westgate, and MacGregor House are at least 1500 feet (450 m) away.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{employs a}} continuous wave <b>radar</b> technique and <b>apparatus</b> {{which can be}} used as a distance measuring system in the presence of background clutter by utilizing small passive transponders. A first continuous electromagnetic wave signal S sub 1 at a first frequency f sub 1 is transmitted from a first location. A transponder carried by a target object positioned at a second (remote) location receives the transmitted signal, phase-coherently divides the f sub 1 frequency and its phase, and re-transmits the transmitted signal as a second continuous electromagnetic wave signal S sub 2 at a lower frequency f sub 2 which is a subharmonic of f sub 1. The re-transmitted signal is received at the first location where a measurement of the phase difference is made between the signals S sub 1 and S sub 2, such measuremnt being indicative of the distance between the first and second locations...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing {{of solar}} system bodies using the JPL Goldstone {{facility}} {{and the radio}} telescope at Arecibo to characterize the surfaces of the objects is {{described in terms of}} present and planned studies. Moon observations proceed at wavelengths from 8. 6 mm to 20 m, and are nominally in the centimeter range. Cross sections available from the <b>radar</b> data and <b>apparatus</b> are discussed, noting the practice of using backscattered signals to define the shape of terrain. A review is presented of polarization properties models of the moon's surface, and the design of an experiment using a spacecraft with bistatic radar to determine the dielectric constant of the moon's surface is outlined. Radar is noted to have been used to characterize the rotation period of Mercury, the absorption profile and the topography of Venus, and aided in choosing a landing site for the Viking spacecraft. The existence of higher-than-expected polarization near the Galilean satellites is mentioned as an unexplained phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of duct height {{has a significant}} effect on marine <b>radar</b> or wireless <b>apparatus</b> applications. The paper presents two models to verify the adaptation of evaporation duct models in the SCS in winter. A meteorological gradient instrument used to measure evaporation ducts was fabricated using hydrological and meteorological sensors at different heights. An experiment on the adaptive characteristics of evaporation duct models was carried out over the SCS. The heights of the evaporation ducts were measured by means of log-linear fit, Paulus-Jeske (PJ) and Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) models. The results showed that NPS model offered significant advantages in stability compared with the PJ model. According the collected data computed by the NPS model, the mean deviation (MD) was - 1. 7 m, and the Standard Deviation (STD) of the MD was 0. 8 m compared with the true value. The NPS model may be more suitable for estimating the evaporation duct height in the SCS in winter due to its simpler system characteristics compared with meteorological gradient instruments...|$|R

50|$|Goldstein {{determined}} that the ship's own structure and electronic equipment was causing the interference, and devised a practical solution. First, to provide the clearest possible access to transmitted radio waves, the HF/DF receiver antenna was placed at the highest point of the ship's mast, receiving priority over even the <b>radar</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Secondly, Goldstein developed a detailed testing and calibration protocol through which every individual HF/DF system was carefully customized {{to account for the}} structure, layout and electronics of the specific ship into which it was being installed. This calibration procedure was carried out in port, by having a small craft circle around the HF/DF-equipped vessel while transmitting its bearings on the frequencies employed by German submarines, and matching the transmitted data against the DAQ HF/DF reading.|$|E
40|$|The radar {{equation}} is usually given in free {{space and the}} field far from the radar transmitted is only studied. However, using the <b>radar</b> sounding <b>apparatus</b> to detect meteorite buried within the ice, we should consider the field near the radar transmitted. In this paper, the scattered field near the radar transmitted is calculated exactly and a more accurate {{radar equation}} is derived. Based on the detailed calculation of the modified radar equation the detectable domains indicate that the intensity of echo reflected from the meteorite buried in the ice is sufficient to be detected by the present radio echo sounding apparatus taking G_ 0 = 2 as the antenna gain and P_r/P_i=(10) ^ as the maximum sensitivity of the back-scattered power from spherical meteorite. The detectable domain for iron meteorite is larger than that for stony meteorite, indicating that if the diameter is identical, the detectable depth for iron meteorite must be deeper than that for stony meteorite. The detectable domain extends to a smaller diameter of meteorite and a larger depth using a higher frequency {{in the case of}} the Rayleigh scattering, but it should be noted that for iron meteorite, the frequency dependence on the detectable domain becomes reciprocal and shows resonance phenomena for the 400 MHz at the diameter larger than about 10 cm where the scattering aspect due to meteorite pieces dispersed in the ice changes from the Rayleigh scattering into the Mie scattering. In the maximum frequency of diameter of meteorite, about 20 cm for the iron meteorite and 1 cm for the stony meteorite, the detectable domain shows resonance phenomena for the iron meteorite by the electromagnetic wave of 400 MHz at the depth of 10 m, while for the stony meteorite the detectable domain is within 1 m in depth. Therefore, a higher frequency should be applied to detect the stony meteorite...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{modification}} led to {{a long-range}} fighter version; the Blenheim Mk IF. For this role, about 200 Blenheims were fitted with a gun pack under the fuselage for four [...]303 in (7.7 mm) Brownings. Later, the Airborne Intercept (AI) Mk III or IV radar was fitted to some aircraft in use as night fighters; these were the first British fighters to be equipped with radar. The Blenheim had been selected as the first aircraft to be adapted for this role as its fuselage was sufficiently roomy to accommodate the additional crew member and <b>radar</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Their performance was marginal as a fighter, but they served as an interim type pending availability of the more capable Beaufighter derivative. About 60 Mk IVs were also equipped with the gun pack as the Mk IVF and were used by Coastal Command to protect convoys from German long-range bombers.|$|E
5000|$|The Italians were {{confident}} they could fend off any daylight incursions by Britain's Royal Navy, {{especially given the}} German Luftwaffe's ability to dominate the daytime skies, but there were legitimate concerns the Italian fleet would face serious difficulties if the British sought to disrupt the seaborne landings by night. Lacking ship-borne radar and neglectful in providing night-fighting training and equipment to its naval forces, the Regia Marina had fared badly during a night action with British forces off Cape Matapan in March 1941. A similar encounter off Malta might wreak havoc on the slow-moving Axis invasion convoys, leaving the airborne forces cut off and imperiling Axis chances of taking the island.The Italian Navy had made some efforts to rectify this situation by equipping the battleship Littorio with an experimental E.C.-3/bis Gufo (Owl) <b>radar</b> <b>apparatus</b> in August 1941 but the unit was considered unreliable (not until September 1942 did Littorio receive a standardised production-version Gufo with better performance; this set could detect surface ships at a range of [...] and aircraft out {{to a range of}} [...] ).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Most of <b>radar</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{equipped}} {{from the}} 1980 s {{to the early}} part of this century were mainly manual and hydraulic leveling which were time-consuming and of low leveling precision. Thus, to avoid these problems, this paper attempts to design a leveling mechanism, which is driven by AC servo motor and supported by ball screw with high transmission efficiency and carrying capacity. Meanwhile, a new method of braking and self-locking composed of motor braking and single direction non-return bearing is introduced in the paper. This leveling mechanism with the characteristics of small volume, simple structure and high efficiency is of universality and portability...|$|E
30|$|Several {{methods for}} {{nondestructive}} detection of termite attacks {{have been investigated}} and developed. They are classified into two categories: detection of termite activity in the wooden constructions and evaluation of mass loss of wooden objects. An example of the former is acoustic emission (AE) monitoring, which utilizes the detection of small elastic waves called acoustic emissions (AEs), generated by the feeding activity of worker termites in wood [1 – 4]. Technology to detect reflection of micro or millimeter waves from termite movement in the wood has also been developed and applied [5, 6]. One of the latest methods is the detection of inner cavities by measuring the velocity or attenuation of the sound or elastic wave propagating in wood. A scanning <b>radar</b> <b>apparatus</b> at 1.4  GHz, which detects {{the reflection of the}} wave radiated onto the wood, was applied for the nondestructive detection of an inner defect in wood such as a cavity [7].|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a pilot study into driving speeds of 46 "snorfietsers" and 387 moped riders. Radar speed measurements were carried out within and outside built-up areas {{in the western part of}} the Netherlands in April 1992. One result is that the maximum legal speed limit of 25 km/h for "snorfietsen" is exceeded by 48 % of the "snorfietsers", mainly younger male riders. It can be concluded that the speed limits is exceeded by a considerably number of: (1) moped riders within built-up areas; and (2) "snorfietsers". It seems that "snorfietsers" are more inclined to exceed the speed limit outside built-up areas. However, it was not possible to measure the actual number of speed offenders due to the technical failure of the <b>radar</b> <b>apparatus.</b> It is recommended that this pilot study should be on a larger scale spread all over the Netherlands in order to investigate a greater number of "snorfietsers"...|$|E
