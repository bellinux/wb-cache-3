25|$|Distance {{may also}} be {{measured}} {{as a function of}} time. The <b>radar</b> <b>mile</b> is the amount of time it takes for a radar pulse to travel one nautical mile, reflect off a target, and return to the radar antenna. Since a nautical mile is defined as 1,852m, then dividing this distance by the speed of light (299,792,458m/s), and then multiplying the result by 2 yields a result of 12.36μs in duration.|$|E
50|$|The data mile {{is used in}} radar-related {{subjects}} and is equal to 6,000 feet (1.8288 kilometres). The <b>radar</b> <b>mile</b> is a unit of time (in {{the same way that}} the light year is a unit of distance), equal to the time required for a radar pulse to travel a distance of two miles (one mile each way). Thus, the radar statute mile is 10.8 μs and the radar nautical mile is 12.4 μs.|$|E

50|$|The Argentines had {{problems}} with spare parts for their airborne radar aircraft, which were effectively grounded on 15 May 1982. In their place the AN/TPS-43 three-dimensional radar and an AN/TPS-44 radar were used from the Falklands (named Las Malvinas by the Argentines). On the 25 May 1982 the Atlantic Conveyor was spotted by the <b>radar</b> 110 <b>miles</b> north-east of the Falklands. At 7.30am this information was passed to the naval air base at Rio Grande (now Hermes Quijada International Airport) on the Tierra del Fuego.|$|R

The plane confirmed Cluff’s report. But it wasn’t until 4:00 that a further check showed Pendleton over due in Boston and identified the Chatham wreckage as hers.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Butch O'Hare was {{on board}} the {{aircraft}} carrier , which had been assigned the task of penetrating enemy-held waters north of New Ireland. While still 450 miles from the harbor at Rabaul, at 10:15, the Lexington picked up an unknown aircraft on <b>radar</b> 35 <b>miles</b> from the ship. A six-plane combat patrol was launched, two fighters being directed to investigate the contact. These two planes, under command of Lieutenant Commander John Thach shot down a four-engined Kawanishi H6K4 Type 97 ("Mavis") flying boat about 43 miles out at 11:12. Later two other planes of the combat patrol were sent to another <b>radar</b> contact 35 <b>miles</b> ahead, shooting down a second Mavis at 12:02. A third contact was made 80 miles out, but reversed course and disappeared. At 15:42 a jagged vee signal drew {{the attention of the}} Lexington's radar operator. The contact then was lost, but reappeared at 16:25 forty-seven miles west and closing fast. Butch O'Hare, flying F4F Wildcat BuNo 4031 [...] "White F-15", was one of several pilots launched to intercept the incoming 9 Japanese Mitsubishi G4M [...] "Betty" [...] bombers from 2nd Chutai of 4th Kōkūtai; [...] at this time five had already been shot down.|$|R
50|$|Ward, in Sea Harrier XZ451, {{and another}} {{aircraft}} were just returning to Invincible after a combat air patrol {{when they were}} sent to check a target seen on <b>radar</b> 20 <b>miles</b> north of the ship. They found a four-engined Lockheed C-130 Hercules at 200 feet above the sea. Ward's first AIM-9L Sidewinder missile fell short of the C-130, but the second started a fire between {{the inner and outer}} port engines. Ward then fired 240 rounds from his Harrier's two ADEN cannons and this action broke off the wing of the enemy aircraft, sending it crashing into the sea and killing the seven crew members.|$|R
50|$|Twenty years later, {{the area}} {{was chosen as the}} site of the first nuclear power station to be built on Ukrainian soil.

50|$|The first {{full-size}} launch, {{weighing in}} total 104 tons, {{took place at}} Woomera on 24 May 1966, with dummy upper stages. Tests were conducted by Australia's Weapons Research Establishment and the French Laboratoire de Recherche en Balistique et Aérodynamique (based at Vernon). After two minutes and fifteen seconds, six seconds short of the planned flight, the rocket was destroyed as it was thought (by an impact predictor) to be veering west of the planned trajectory.

5000|$|On March 5, 1969 Prinair Flight 277 {{departed}} Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands for {{a flight}} to San Juan. Seventeen minutes after take-off, the crew contacted San Juan Approach Control. The approach controller on duty (a trainee) replied; [...] "Prinair Two Seven Seven, San Juan Approach Control, <b>radar</b> contact three <b>miles</b> east of Isla Verde...maintain four thousand." [...] The aircraft was actually three {{miles east of the}} Fajardo waypoint instead of the Isla Verde waypoint (which is located about 10 miles west of the Fajardo waypoint). Six minutes later the aircraft crashed in the Sierra de Luquillo mountains at an elevation of about 2400 feet; all 19 occupants were killed. The accident investigation found that Air Traffic Control was to blame.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the success}} rate of the Line dropped, the network of radars and {{plotting}} stations continued to prove their worth. Now when a raid started, night fighters from any base within range were directed into the stream, where it was hoped {{they would be able}} to find aircraft with their radar. At the same time a massive building program started to add hundreds of Würzburgs to the system, although the infrastructure needed was extensive. The boxes were initially the radius of the Würzburg <b>radars,</b> about 22 <b>miles,</b> but more powerful radar later on made the boxes up to 100 miles across. Eventually, the line of boxes was several deep, especially around larger towns and the Ruhr valley. Once again the system started to score increasing successes against the British raids.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} present {{findings}} {{and the overall}} methodology for estimating roadway rain rates. In order to accurately estimate rainfall rates along Interstate highways in Northeast Florida for the Florida Road Weather information System (RWIS) in near real time, the investigators developed and implemented a new methodology to geo-locate Doppler radar rain rates. The intent of this project is to geo-locate the National Weather Service's WSR- 88 D level- 2 Doppler <b>radar</b> to specific <b>mile</b> markers along the roadways of interest, to initiate alerts or warnings to drivers. The geo-located Doppler information can then be analyzed, along with the point-specific shed rate of the road, to determine near real-time conditions of ponding and hydroplaning, and also used for historical analysis of accident statistics to establish causality between accidents that occurred and actual hydroplaning potential...|$|R
25|$|On 29 January 1940 Flight Lieutenant Caesar Hull led {{a section}} of 43 Squadron to {{intercept}} an unidentified aircraft caught on <b>radar.</b> Ten <b>miles</b> south-west of Hartlepool at 90:45 GMT, they engaged a Heinkel He 111. It was one of nine He 111s that had separated form its formation upon reaching the English coast. Hull, Carey and Pilot Officer H. L North fired at it as they chased it out over the sea. They observed no results and returned to base. Hull found a bullet hole in his Hurricane upon landing. The He 111 was from 6. Staffel (Squadron), Kampfgeschwader 26 (4./KG 26). On 30 January Frank and Hull were on patrol near Coquet Island. They intercepted 26 He 111s from KG 26 that were targeting merchant shipping and fishing boats. The German bombers were flying at low altitude just below the cloud line at approximately 1,000ft. This tactic enabled the German bomber pilot to easily escape into the cloud if spotted. The two pilots dropped to sea-level and engaged an enemy unseen. The He 111, from, 4./KG 26, crashed into the sea. Pilot Feldwebel Helmut Höfner were posted missing in action. The observer was confirmed to {{have been killed in}} action when his body was recovered. Carey attempted to use his gun camera to record the Heinkel as it sank nose-first on the water but it failed to work.|$|R
50|$|Charybdis {{picked up}} the convoy on its <b>radar</b> at 7 <b>miles</b> distance, but did not {{intercept}} radio transmissions, HMS Limbourne heard radio transmissions but could not pick up the ships on radar as Charybdis was blocking its view. At 1:38am German torpedo boat T-23, {{under the command of}} Friedrich-Karl Paul, spotted Charybdis, which was hit on the port side by two torpedoes out of a salvo of six fired by T-23 and T-27. Limbourne was also hit during this action and was later scuttled by HMS Rocket. The German force escaped unharmed. Charybdis sank within half an hour, in position , with the loss of over 400 men. Four officers and 103 ratings survived. Münsterland was eventually forced ashore and destroyed west of Cap Blanc Nez on 21 January 1944 by fire from British coastal artillery after she ran aground.|$|R
5000|$|Then, the airport's {{approach}} controller responded [...] "Prinair two seven seven San Juan Approach Control <b>radar</b> contact three <b>miles</b> east of Isla Verde fly a heading of two five zero for a vector to ILS final maintain four thousand." [...] The {{approach controller}}, {{who was a}} trainee on the fateful afternoon, mistakenly thought that Prinair Flight 277 was near San Juan, but it was instead near Luquillo at what is described as the [...] "Fajardo intersection". One minute after this communication, Prinair Flight 277 was asked to go to flight level 3, or 3,000 ft and prepare for landing. The airplane was vectored for a landing into runway 7. The plane's pilots, trusting that the information given to them was correct, followed the instructions and prepared for landing, soon finding themselves {{in front of an}} unavoidable mountain instead. At 5:38 pm, 23 minutes after the flight took off from St. Thomas, it crashed into some trees at Sierra Luquillo mountains, killing everyone on board.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{training}} {{operations in}} the Hawaiian area, Trathen joined Rear Admiral Willis A. [...] "Ching" [...] Lees Task Force (TF) 11 {{to take part in}} the reoccupation of Baker Island. The target isle, a tiny elliptical speck of land, lay nearer to the Japanese-held northern Gilbert Islands than Funafuti in the Ellice group and presented a valuable staging area for projected aerial search and photo reconnaissance missions against the Japanese mandates. Lee, in Hercules (AK-41), led TF 11s sortie from Pearl Harbor on 25 August 1943, and his ships arrived off Baker on 1 September. While the transports and Ashland (LSD-1) disembarked their troops and disgorged their cargoes shoreward, Trathen stood by and provided fighter-direction services to the Grumman F6F Hellcats from Belleau Wood (CVL-24) and Princeton (CVL-23). During the action, the destroyer directed the F6Fs to a <b>radar</b> contact 32 <b>miles</b> away. They soon came upon the snooping Kawanishi H8K (Allied identifier: [...] "Emily") flying boat and dispatched her so fast that no radio report from the Japanese got out over the airwaves. Two days later, Trathen again vectored the Hellcats to another [...] "Emily" [...] which they also splashed into the sea.|$|R
5000|$|Nooy's next {{opportunity}} arose on 30 March during another CAP sortie in {{the vicinity}} of Palau. Unlike at Truk, when the fast carrier force achieved surprise and Japanese air forces could not muster a forceful counter-attack, the enemy knew that the Americans were coming. Japanese planes were already airborne when VF-31 began to take flight. Nooy's division was vectored to investigate <b>radar</b> contacts 50 <b>miles</b> out—what turned out to be almost a dozen Judy dive bombers headed for reprisal against American carriers. Nooy was the first to see the bandits. Tallyhoing his group, Nooy led the way in from above. It was not to be a long, running engagement as before. Instead, his [...]50 caliber guns raked through the first enemy's engine leaving it wreathed in flames. Nooy continued to fight vertically, climbing and diving three more times on three separate enemy aircraft. On the second and third runs his quarry smoked and broke ranks, but did not burn. Nooy was determined to finally seal the deal on his fourth pass. He clung to the Judy after his first pass, unleashing short bursts that were visibly wrecking the bomber as he chased it lower and lower. It finally caught fire at the wing root and slammed into the water below. Nooy was credited victories against the first and fourth pilots he fought, bringing his total score to three.|$|R
50|$|The Shrike {{was first}} {{employed}} during the Vietnam War by the Navy in 1965 using A-4 aircraft. The Air Force adopted the weapon {{the following year}} using F-105F and G Thunderchief Wild Weasel SEAD aircraft, and later the F-4 Phantom II in the same role. The range was nominally shorter than the SA-2 Guideline missiles that the system was used against, {{although it was a}} great improvement over the early method of attacking SAM sites with rockets and bombs from F-100F Super Sabres. A Shrike was typically lofted about 30 degrees above the horizon at a Fan Song <b>radar</b> some 15 <b>miles</b> (25 km) away for a flight time of 50 seconds. Tactics changed incrementally over the campaigns of 1966 and 1967 until the advent of the AGM-78 Standard ARM. That new weapon allowed launches from significantly longer range with a much easier attack profile, as the ARM could be launched up to 180 degrees off target and still expect a hit and its speed allowed it to travel faster than the SA-2. Even after the AGM-78 entered service, the Weasels still carried the Shrike because the ARM cost about $200,000, while a Shrike cost only $7,000. If USAF pilots expended an ARM they would have to fill out a lengthy form during debriefing. A somewhat standard load for the F-105G was a 650 US gal (2,500 L) centerline fuel tank, two AGM-78s on inboard pylons and two Shrikes on the outboards. The mix varied slightly for jamming pods and the occasional AIM-9 Sidewinder but this was the baseline.|$|R
