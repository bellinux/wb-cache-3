40|$|The Standard Model of {{particle}} physics (SM) is {{a theoretical framework}} that integrates our current knowledge of the subatomic world and its fundamental interactions. A key program built {{in the structure of}} the SM is the Renormalization Group (RG), whose function is to preserve self-consistency and describe how parameters of the theory evolve with the energy scale. Despite being overwhelmingly supported by experimental data, the SM has many puzzling aspects, such as the large number of parameters, a triplication of chiral families and the existence of three gauge interactions. In contrast with the majority of mainstream proposals advanced over the years, the basic premise of our study is that a satisfactory <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>challenges</b> confronting the SM requires further advancing the RG program. In particular, understanding the nonlinear dynamics of RG equations and the unavoidable transition from smooth to fractal dimensionality of space-time are critically important for the success of this endeavor. Here we show how the onset of fractal space-time near or above the electroweak scale is likely to settle at least some of these challenges...|$|E
30|$|Sadler (1988) {{proposed}} that the culture of an organization is a crucial factor affecting attitudes toward communication and communication processes and systems. Organizational culture represents the tacit norms, shared values, beliefs, and daily practices that shape the patterns and qualities of interactions between employees at different hierarchical levels. Senior management team may potentially mitigate audit challenges, and aid in successful <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>challenges</b> that arise. In general, a fair process builds trust and commitment and produces voluntary cooperation. Voluntary cooperation drives performance, thus leading people {{to go beyond the}} call of duty by sharing their knowledge and applying their creativity. In addition, mentoring can bring an array of important benefits at a reasonable cost. Anticipated outcomes of a mentoring program for individuals in a learning organization include acquiring, comprehending, and applying new knowledge in daily tasks; individually and collaboratively analyzing problems and proposing solutions; evaluating new technologies or strategies and determining their utility; and creating new business plans to improve organizational performance (Klinge 2015). Lange et al. (2015) suggested that for professional service workers, immediate work relevance of continuing professional development activities was the key determinant of the type of CPD activity rather than longer term career progression. Performance is used to refer to the individual’s ability to be creative, innovative, inspiring, and take on challenging tasks to achieve organizational goals for the greater good. Therefore, audit authorities must create an environment where achieving high quality is valued, nurtured, and rewarded. Such a requirement contributes to the profession’s objective of providing high-quality services to meet the needs of the public.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} Niger Delta amnesty programme and the proposed amnesty for Boko Haram insurgents in Nigeria.

One of such strong voices in favour of amnesty for Boko Haram insurgents is the Sultan of Sokoto, AlhajiSa’adAbubakar, who, on the 7 th of March 2013, called for “total and unconditional” amnesty for Boko Haram. Sultan Abubakar’s demand has attracted mixed reaction as it is largely supported by the northern group-Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and rejected by others such as the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN).
