5|$|Hamilton {{fought in}} the <b>Raid</b> <b>on</b> St Malo in June 1758. The British landed near St Malo, at first {{planning}} to attack the town. However, they decided to destroy shipping first and attack the town later. Finding that to occupy the town would require a full siege, for which they had insufficient troops, they occupied St Servan, where they burned over one hundred vessels including thirty privateers. British ships retreated after seeing a large French force, but sailed around the coast {{for a few weeks}} seeking another place to attack. Even though the <b>Raid</b> <b>on</b> St Malo was small and little damage was done, it is considered a British victory.|$|E

5|$|The unit's first {{operation}} was the successful <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> the Lofoten Islands in 4 March 1941. The next two planned operations were both cancelled {{and it was}} not until 22 April 1942 that No. 4 Commando took part in another raid, Operation Abercrombie, a <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> the French coastal town of Hardelot. On 22 August 1942, No.4 was one of three commando units selected for the Dieppe raid. Under the command of Lord Lovat, No.4 Commando landed on the right flank of the main landings and successfully silenced a German gun battery. This was the only complete success of the operation, which was eventually aborted, after less than 10 hours, following heavy losses.|$|E

5|$|All {{the other}} Channel Islands raids were less successful. In January 1943, Operation Huckabuck, a <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> Herm, was a failure.

The next raids were Operations Hardtack 28 and Hardtack 7 in December 1943. The Hardtack 28 <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> Jersey ended in failure when two men were killed and one wounded after they walked into a minefield. The exploding mines alerted the German garrison and the Commandos had to abandon the operation. In Hardtack 7 the Commandos had returned to Sark, but had to abandon the operation and return to England when they were unable to scale the island's cliffs.|$|E
