5|$|One {{aspect of}} the Carolinian method of {{estimating}} longitude on inter-island sailings is to visualize the target island relative to a second reference island's alignment with a succession of selected stars, points of the star compass. It is a refined system of dead reckoning whereby the navigator constantly synthesizes his position relative to the reference island's location in his mental model. The most <b>remarkable</b> <b>thing</b> is that the reference island (lu pongank) may be over the horizon, unseen, even imaginary.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the success of Frozen, {{director}} Chris Buck stated: [...] "We never expected anything like this. We just hoped {{to make a movie}} that did as well as Tangled! I hoped the audience would embrace it and respond to it, but there's no way we could have predicted this." [...] He cited a number of reasons for the film's popularity: [...] "There are characters that people relate to; the songs are so strong and memorable. We also have some flawed characters, which is what Jen and I like to do– we essentially create two imperfect princesses." [...] As Frozen approached the first anniversary of its release, Menzel mentioned the film's continuing popularity in an October 2014 interview: [...] "It’s just a <b>remarkable</b> <b>thing.</b> Usually you do a project and it has its moment. This just feels like it keeps going." ...|$|E
500|$|A major motif present {{throughout}} {{the game is}} that [...] "life goes on". A scene {{near the end of}} the game, in which Joel and Ellie discover a herd of giraffes, is referenced by many journalists as the denouement of this motif. Concept artist John Sweeney wrote that the scene was designed to [...] "reignite [...] lust for life", triggering her curiosity and forgetting the surrounding struggle and death. He explained that the scene originally involved zebras, but were replaced by giraffes due to their gentleness and elegance, stating that they were [...] "the most <b>remarkable</b> <b>thing</b> Ellie could possibly encounter". Druckmann felt that the sequence [...] "works because of all the horrible things" [...] encountered beforehand. IGN's Lucy O'Brien wrote that the scene acts as a reminder of Ellie's age, despite having been outwardly [...] "stripped of any semblance of a childhood", and Kotaku writer Kirk Hamilton found the scene to be a resemblance of hope for Ellie, having clearly suffered post-traumatic stress following her encounter with David.|$|E

500|$|In The Spectator, Jonathan Sumption {{praised the}} book, writing [...] "The public {{hysteria}} surrounding such high-profile incidents {{as the death}} of the Princess of Wales and the search for Madeleine McCann, or the eccentricities of the MacPherson report on the death of Stephen Lawrence are analysed with the author's customary mixture of shrewdness, cynicism and misanthropic pessimism. These phenomena have of course been analysed before, and many of the same points have been made. But Dalrymple is good at relating them to broader trends in our society". [...] The book was described by Toby Young in The Daily Telegraph as being an [...] "excellent new book attacking the cult of sentimentality" [...] and that Dalrymple also [...] "makes a convincing case that standards in British education have plummeted in the last few decades". Young also reviewed the book on his blog No Sacred Cows, where he wrote, [...] "...the <b>remarkable</b> <b>thing</b> about Spoilt Rotten is that Dalrymple never lets his anger obscure his compassion. Throughout the book you get a powerful sense that his outrage is rooted in a commitment to social justice. Yes, he believes members of the underclass should be weaned off the nanny state and forced to take responsibility for themselves, but he also believes it is left-wing intellectuals who have reduced them to a state of helpless infantalism, mainly through the promotion of the cult of sentimentality. He is not a Christian, but believes that it is only when Britain's benefit dependents rediscover the doctrine of Original Sin {{that they will be able}} to help themselves".|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{that year}} Witherspoon {{was chosen to}} portray June Carter Cash, the second wife of country music singer-songwriter Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), in Walk the Line. She never {{had the chance to}} meet Carter Cash, as Witherspoon was filming Vanity Fair at the time Carter Cash died. Witherspoon {{performed}} her own vocals in the film and her songs had to be performed in front of a live audience, she was so worried about needing to perform live that she asked her lawyer to terminate the film contract. [...] "That was the most challenging part of the role," [...] she later recalled in an interview, [...] "I'd never sung professionally." [...] Subsequently, she had to spend six months learning how to sing for the role. Witherspoon's portrayal of Carter Cash was well received by critics, and Roger Ebert wrote that her performance added [...] "boundless energy" [...] to the movie. She won several awards for her performance, including the Golden Globe Award, the Screen Actors Guild, the BAFTA and the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role. Besides critical success in the movie industry, Witherspoon and Phoenix received a nomination for [...] "collaborative video of the year" [...] from the CMT Music Awards. Witherspoon expressed her passion for the movie: [...] "I really like in this film that it is realistic and portrays sort of a real marriage, a real relationship where there are forbidden thoughts and fallibility. And it is about compassion in the long haul, not just the short easy solutions to problems." [...] She also stated that she believed Carter Cash was a woman ahead of her time: [...] "I think the really <b>remarkable</b> <b>thing</b> about her character is that she did all of these things that we sort of see as normal things in the 1950s when it wasn't really acceptable for a woman to be married and divorced twice and have two different children by two different husbands and travel around in a car full of very famous musicians all by herself. She didn't try to comply to social convention, so I think that makes her a very modern woman." ...|$|E

2500|$|CBS Sports hockey writer Chris Peters said, [...] "There's no {{question}} the game has grown throughout the United States with participation in the sport at an all-time high, in addition to rising revenues for the NHL itself. The game is also reaching its best exposure through its TV deal with NBC Sports. That {{could be one of}} Bettman's crowning achievements. The <b>remarkable</b> <b>thing</b> about the NHL is that it remains incredibly strong, if not stronger coming out of two lockouts in the last decade. Gary Bettman…may not be perfect…but (he) is a good leader for the NHL and probably deserves some recognition for it." ...|$|E

2500|$|O'Keeffe was {{a legend}} {{beginning}} in the 1920s, known as much for her independent spirit and female role model, as for her dramatic and innovative works of art. Nancy and Jules Heller said, [...] "The most <b>remarkable</b> <b>thing</b> about O'Keefe was the audacity and uniqueness of her early work." [...] At that time, even in Europe, there were few arts exploring abstraction. Even though her works may show elements of different modernist movements, such as Surrealism and Precisionism, her work is uniquely her own style. She received unprecedented acceptance as a woman artist from the fine art world due to her powerful graphic images and within a decade of moving to New York City, she was the highest paid American woman artist. She was known for a distinctive style {{in all aspects of}} her life. O'Keeffe was also known for her relationship with Stieglitz, in which she provided some insight in her autobiography.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{official}} {{review of the}} album from AllMusic gave it 4 out of 5 stars, on par with what they gave her debut. The site classified the album as [...] "completely contemporary country", and said [...] "the <b>remarkable</b> <b>thing</b> about Carnival Ride is that it's stronger song for song than Some Hearts." [...] They also praised the album for having [...] "the appearance of a genuine heart, something that no other big country-pop album has had since {{the glory days of}} Come On Over." [...] USA Today also praised the album for its versatility saying [...] "The songs call for vulnerability (You Won’t Find This), urgency (Flat on the Floor), sympathy (Crazy Dreams, her co-written salute to “the hairbrush singers and dashboard drummers” from whose ranks she sprang), humor (The More Boys I Meet, the tag line of which goes “The more I love my dog”) and extreme role-playing (Last Name’s saga of a bar pickup that turns into an impulsive Vegas marriage). She delivers on all counts." [...] The Boston Herald gave the album a B, and claimed, [...] "Underwood manages enough spunk to occasionally avoid the cookie-cutter, especially with the curious beat-box-meets-banjo arrangement of [...] "Get Out of This Town" [...] and [...] "Just a Dream," [...] a bona fide [...] about a young war widow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Overall {{characters}} attracted criticism {{like those}} by Sean Gaffney of A Case Suitable for Treatment, who affirmed they are [...] "rather colorless". Kanae's {{role in the}} first volume was especially criticized by Garrity, who said her reasoning to become Daisuke's assistant is [...] "more or less random". Danica Davidson for Graphic Novel Reporter and Henderson also considered Kanae's role was to be someone for Daisuke to rescue. Bill Sherman of Blogcritics was more positive, saying in a volume two review that the main trio [...] "remain appealing enough characters to get most readers wanting {{to find out what}} happens in the next book". Although Snow Wildsmith of ICv2 dubbed the characters [...] "forgettable", she appreciated the first volume because it shows Daisuke has [...] "a potentially interesting backstory." [...] Henderson also praised some of his backstory revelations, while Zoth commented the mention of his special power in the first volume was a positive indication [...] "that there is more depth to the world and characters than Esuno has thus far revealed." [...] Indeed, when this power was revealed, Santos affirmed [...] "the most <b>remarkable</b> <b>thing</b> about Hanako that it still has the capacity to surprise", and Zimmerman stated it was [...] "page turner" [...] that [...] "show exactly what Esuno is capable of when given the opportunity to explore his imagination." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{the members}} of the Labia family of the mid 18th century to whom the palazzo owes its notability today, it was {{inhabited}} by two brothers with their wives, children and mother. [...] The brothers Angelo Maria Labia and his brother Paolo Antonio Labia employed Tiepolo {{at the height of his}} powers to decorate the ballroom. [...] Employing Tiepolo seems to have been the most <b>remarkable</b> <b>thing</b> the brothers ever achieved. Angelo Maria became an Abbé, merely in order to escape the political obligations of an aristocrat of the Republic. [...] Curiously his holy employment did not prevent him marrying. His wife however was a commoner, which indicates an almost morganatic status to the marriage. [...] Angelo's chief interests were constructing a marionette theatre, which concealed real singers behind its scenes. [...] The marionettes often performed satirical plays which Angelo wrote himself. [...] In later life he failed to endear himself to Venetian society by becoming an informer to the dreaded inquisition. [...] His younger brother Paolo, married conventionally into the old Venetian aristocracy, a class prepared to accept the Labia's money and hospitality if not equality. [...] Paolo too never assumed any public duties. [...] It appears that it was their mother, Maria Labia, who was the intellectual driving force of the family, in her youth a great beauty, she was painted by Rosalba Carriera. The French traveller and social commentator Charles de Brosses reported that in old age she had a lively wit, flirtatious nature and possessed the finest collection of jewels in Europe. [...] This collection was also portrayed in some of Tiepolo's work in the palazzo.|$|E
