60|$|I trusted my cause last Sunday, I fear, to an unsympathizing agent. To Mr. Tuffin I can {{scarcely}} think myself bound {{to make a}} direct apology, as my promise was wholly conditional. This I did, not only from general foresight, but from the possibility of hearing from you, that you {{had not been able}} to untie your former engagement. To you, therefore, I owe the apology: and on you I expressly and earnestly desired Tobin to call and to explain for me, that I had been in an utterly incompatible state of bodily feeling the whole evening at Mr. Renny's; that I was much hurt by the walk home through the wet; instantly on my return here had an attack in my bowels; that this had not wholly left me, and therefore that I could not come, unless the weather altered. By which I did not mean merely its 'holding up' (though even this it did not do at four o'clock at Barnard's Inn, the sleety rain was still falling, though slightly), but the drying up of the rawness and dampness, which would infallibly have diseased me, before I had reached the Institution--not to mention the effect of sitting a long evening in damp clothes and shoes on an invalid, scarcely recovered from a diarrhoea. I have thought it fit to explain at large, both as a mark of respect to you, and because I have very unjustly acquired a character for breaking engagements, entirely from the non-sympathy of the well with the sick, the robust with the weakly. It must be difficult for most men to conceive the extreme reluctance with which I go at all into 'company', and the unceasing depression which I am struggling up against during the whole time I am in it, which too often makes me drink more 'during dinner' than I ought to do, and as often forces me into efforts of almost obtrusive conversation, 'acting' the opposite of my real state of mind in order to arrive at a medium, as we <b>roll</b> <b>paper</b> the opposite way in order to smoothe it.|$|E

Following the Copyflo, the process was scaled down to produce the 1824 microfilm printer. At about half the size and weight, this still sizable machine printed onto hand-fed, cut-sheet paper which was pulled through the process by one of two gripper bars. A scaled-down version of this gripper feed system was to become the basis for the 813 desktop copier.|$|E

As a result, Paterson became the nucleus for a burgeoning mill industry. In 1793, two years after the society's foundation, the falls was the site of the first water-powered cotton spinning mill in New Jersey. In 1812, it was the site of the state's first continuous <b>roll</b> <b>paper</b> mill. Other products whose construction used the falls as a power source include the Rogers Locomotive Works (1832), the Colt revolver (1837), and the USS Holland (SS-1) (1898). The oldest extant structure in the historic district is the Phoenix Mill, built in 1813. The industrial area also became the site of labor unrest, as it was a center for the 1913 Paterson silk strike. Immigrant workers, facing harsh conditions in factories staged numerous strikes, giving the United States its first organized labor movement.|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model for predicting the pilot rating of an aircraft in a roll task is described. The model includes: (1) the lateral-directional aircraft equations of motion; (2) a stochastic gust model; (3) a pilot model with two free parameters; and (4) a pilot rating expression {{that is a}} function of rms roll angle and the pilot lead time constant. The pilot gain and lead time constant are selected to minimize the pilot rating expression. The pilot parameters are then adjusted to provide a 20 % stability margin and the adjusted pilot parameters are used to compute a <b>roll</b> <b>paper</b> pilot rating of the aircraft/gust configuration. The <b>roll</b> <b>paper</b> pilot rating was computed for 25 aircraft/gust configurations.

40|$|Moringa (Moringa oleifera Lam.) is {{an exotic}} species, from the Indian Northeast, the Moringaceae family and has {{significant}} economic importance, with many applications in industry and medi-cine. This species spreads mainly by seed, so obtaining {{information on the}} behavior of different temperature and substrate on germination becomes essential since there is no standardized methodology for installation of the germination test. Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating the influence of substrate and temperature on germination and vigor of Moringa oleifera Lam. seeds. The experiment was conducted at the Seed Analysis Laboratory of the Federal Rural University of the Semi-Arid (UFERSA). The statistical design was completely randomized in a 5 x 2 factorial scheme (temperature x substrate), totaling ten treatments with four replicates of 25 seeds. The substrates were tested <b>roll</b> <b>paper</b> and vermiculite. Then the seeds were incubated at room Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (B. O.

Solid fiberboards are processed with adhesive into laminated material and used as structural components. The mechanical properties discussed in this paper are longitudinal elastic modulus, Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio, tensile proportional limit and tensile strength. The authors conducted a tensile test by preparing tabular test specimens from laminated material. Using the strain gauge method, the authors determined longitudinal elastic modulus and Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio from the relationship between strain and tensile load, and then determined tensile proportional limit and tensile strength from the load-deformation relationship. On the basis of the test results, the authors discuss the interrelationship between the type of solid fiberboard, the roll direction of specimen and the number of laminated layers...|$|E
