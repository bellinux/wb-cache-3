According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who he felt was treating him like a [...] "B-word", a [...] "P-word", and the [...] "F-word", which Washington said conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back". In 2009, Rhimes told Entertainment Weekly that she may not have handled the incident correctly, stating: [...] "I wasn't interested in what anybody thought publicly. I was interested in what was going on <b>right</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> the ground...with the people I work with every day. Did I do it perfectly? Of course not. This is my first television show. It was a learning experience." [...] Knight said that Rhimes was among those for discouraging him to come out, however Rhimes said: [...] "I remember saying , 'This is our proudest day here. T.R. got to come out and I got to say to him that it wouldn't affect his character' because he was concerned he was going to come out and George would suddenly be gay. [...] The idea that a gay actor can't play a straight man is insulting." ...|$|E
