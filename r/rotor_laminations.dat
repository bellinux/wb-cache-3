A closed-form analysis, which is based on a lumped parameter model, points out that the magnet quantity can be minimized with a significant saving of material volume and cost.

40|$|Advances in {{computing}} hardware, {{software and}} manufacturing have helped revive {{the academic and}} commercial interest in a machine topology known as an axial flux machine (AFM). Traditional linear circuit analysis and basic non-linear Finite Element Analysis (FEA) have provided suitable designs {{for a wide range}} of AFM prototypes worldwide. This thesis examines the design of a particular single-sided AFM prototype developed at the Charles Darwin University in 1993 for use in a solar powered racing car. A thorough examination of the machine design shows a reasonable agreement between design specifications and measured outcomes after accounting for a 10 % decrease in permanent magnet remanence. The unique property of the AFM whereby mechanical flux weakening is achieved via air gap adjustment is investigated, focusing on the resulting change in several important machine parameters. The effect of an air gap distance increase from 1 mm to 4 mm is confirmed to reduce the machine constant by 36 %. 2 D Transient FEA shows that the minimum in cogging torque occurs at a magnet arc width of 128. 2 °e at a nominal air gap distance of 2 mm. 3 D FEA confirms the fact that a significant radial flux component exists in both the rotor and stator under stalled conditions. While it is unlikely that radial flux component will significantly impinge upon the efficiency of the CDU solar car motor, lower pole count machines are likely to suffer.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} reports {{an appropriate}} design methodology for synchronous reluctance machines, their important technical issues, and possible solutions for traction applications. The synchronous reluctance machines {{are used in}} industries owing to their unique merits such as high efficiency, fast dynamic response, and lower cost. Considering these superior properties, recently, this smart synchronous topology became more attractive for electrified powertrain applications in automotive industries. However, compared to the major requirements of the traction motors such as high torque and power density, low torque ripple, wide speed range, and proper size, this machine is still under investigations. The goals of this research work are first; to identify electrical, magnetic, and geometrical parameters which are dominant in the machine’s performance, and second; to verify appropriate design methodology for achieving a higher performance for automotive applications. Hence, analytical and computer aided analysis followed by experimental examinations on prototypes are carried out to support proposed methods and address possible solutions to the machine’s technical issues for these particular applications. Accordingly, the synchronous reluctance machine’s fundamental operations, electrical, magnetic, and geometrical parameters are investigated. Analytical approach and a sizing methodology corresponding to the desired specifications are presented through the machine’s mathematical model. Design of transversal laminated anisotropic rotor structure with different geometries is studied to identify the geometrical parameters effects on the machine’s performance in particular the output torque and torque ripple.

40|$|The Morrison rotor, {{named after}} its inventor, is a hybrid rotor {{for use in}} a bearingless switched-reluctance {{electric}} motor. The motor is characterized as bearingless {{in the sense that it}} does not rely on conventional mechanical bearings: instead, it functions as both a magnetic bearing and a motor. Bearingless switched-reluctance motors are attractive for use in situations in which large variations in temperatures and/or other extreme conditions preclude the use of conventional electric motors and mechanical bearings. In the Morrison motor, as in a prior bearingless switched-reluctance motor, a multipole rotor is simultaneously levitated and rotated. In the prior motor, simultaneous levitation and rotation are achieved by means of two kinds of stator windings: (1) main motor windings and (2) windings that exert levitating forces on a multipole rotor. The multipole geometry is suboptimum for levitation in that it presents a discontinuous surface to the stator pole faces, thereby degrading the vibration-suppression capability of the magnetic bearing. The Morrison rotor simplifies the stator design in that the stator contains only one type of winding. The rotor is a hybrid that includes both (1) a circular lamination stack for levitation and (2) a multipole lamination stack for rotation. A prototype includes six rotor poles and eight stator poles (see figure). During normal operation, two of the four pairs of opposing stator poles (each pair at right angles to the other pair) levitate the rotor. The remaining two pairs of stator poles exert torque on the six-pole <b>rotor</b> <b>lamination</b> stack to produce rotation. The relative lengths of the circular and multipole lamination stacks on the rotor can be chosen to tailor the performance of the motor for a specific application. For a given overall length, increasing the length of the multipole stack relative to the circular stack results in an increase in torque relative to levitation load capacity and stiffness, and vice versa...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{variation}} of the magnetic properties of non-oriented electrical steel sheets with the fatigue state during cyclic mechanical loading. The obtained results are central to the design of variable drives such as traction drives in electric vehicles in which varying mechanical loads, e. g. in the rotor core (centrifugal forces), alter the magnetic properties. Specimens of non-oriented electrical steel are subject to a cyclically varying mechanical tensile stress with different stress amplitudes and number of cycles. The specimens are characterised magnetically at different fatigue states for different magnetic flux densities and magnetising frequencies. The measurements show a variation in magnetic properties depending on the number of cycles and stress magnitude which can be explained by changes in the material structure due to a beginning mechanical fatigue process. The studied effect is critical for the estimation of the impact of mechanical material fatigue on the operational behaviour of electrical machines. Particularly in electrical machines with a higher speed where the rotor is stressed by high centrifugal forces, material fatigue occurs and can lead to deterioration of the <b>rotor’s</b> stack <b>lamination...</b>|$|R

40|$|Magnetic bearing systems {{incorporate}} auxiliary bearings {{to prevent}} physical interaction between <b>rotor</b> and stator <b>laminations.</b> Rotor/auxiliary bearing contacts may occur when a magnetic bearing still retains a full control capability.

An analytical procedure is used to assess the nature of rotor contact modes under idealized contacts. Non-linearities arising from contact and magnetic bearing forces are then included in simulation studies involving rigid and flexible rotors to predict rotor response and evaluate rotor synchronous vibration components. An experimental flexible rotor/magnetic bearing facility is also used to validate the predictions. It is shown that changes in synchronous vibration amplitude and phase induced by contact events causes existing controllers to be ineffective in attenuating rotor displacements. These findings are used in Part 2 of the paper as a foundation for the design of new controllers that are able to recover rotor position control under a range of contact cases...|$|R
40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearings (AMBs) offer contact-free and frictionless {{support of}} rotating machinery. However, {{because of their}} limited force capacity, they have to incorporate retainer bearings to protect the <b>rotor</b> and stator <b>laminations</b> against high-amplitude vibration levels. Efficient modeling of contact dynamics {{is important for the}} design of adaptive controllers to prevent contact.

The method does not require a direct physical modeling of contact forces, although the contact forces are automatically evaluated from the constraint conditions, and it can be applied to multicontact cases. Furthermore, the technique is capable of detecting and simulating the destructive backward whirl rolling motion. A model reduction technique is introduced to improve the computational efficiency.

Past works indicates that a ducted <b>rotor</b> with radial <b>laminations</b> is best suited to be the reluctance rotor. In this paper the geometry of the rotor is investigated. If the ducts are too thin then the reluctance ratio is low and the coupling is affected. If they are too wide then the reluctance path for the coupling flux is high and the machine will saturate quickly. It is found, using finite element analysis, that the duct ratio should be about 38 % from the results in the paper.

40|$|During {{the normal}} {{operation}} of rotor/magnetic bearing systems, contacts with auxiliary bearings or bushes are avoided. However, auxiliary bearings are required under abnormal conditions and in malfunction situations to prevent {{contact between the}} <b>rotor</b> and stator <b>laminations.</b> Studies in the open literature deal largely with rotor drop and the requirements of auxiliary bearings design parameters for safe rundown. Rotor drop occurs when the rotor is delevitated and no further means of magnetic bearing control is available. This paper considers the case when full control is still available and rotor/auxiliary bearing contact has been induced by an abnormal operating condition or a temporary fault. It is demonstrated that events leading to contact from a linearly stable rotor orbit can drive the rotor into a nonlinear vibratory motion involving persistent contacts. Furthermore, the phase of the measured vibration response may be changed {{to such an extent}} that synchronous controllers designed to minimize rotor vibration amplitudes will worsen the rotor response, resulting in higher contact forces.

40|$|Abstract: A typical {{problem of}} radial {{magnetic}} bearing is chosen and bearing involving n-pole pairs, where n = 2, 4, 6, 8, are designed. The total losses {{in each case}} are computed for different rotor speeds. A comparative study of the total losses in each case is performed theoretically in order to arrive at possible optimum situations. The major dimensions required {{for the analysis of}} losses were obtained in all those cases. A loss analysis was performed and the results were presented. It was found that there was a drastic decrease in the total loss from two pole pair to four pole pair.

40|$|Within the {{existing}} available mix of numerical and analytical thermal analysis options, lumped parameter thermal modelling is {{selected as the}} operational backbone to develop an improved novel synchronous generator thermal modelling package. The objective is {{for the creation of}} a user friendly quick feedback tool, which can serve as a means to make quick machine design thermal calculations and answer customer queries quickly and reliably. Furthermore, thermally improved generator designs will allow for inevitable operational losses to be channelled away from the machine more efficiently. As a result, machine component temperatures will be reduced, allowing lower generator thermal ratings. The end result will be smaller, longer lasting, more efficient generators, with the ability to be adapted with greater ease to particular applications. With the contribution of selected numerical analysis techniques, mainly finite element analysis for the distribution of iron losses, the MySolver thermal modelling package is developed and presented in this thesis. It is this combination of numerical and analytical tools that improves synchronous generator thermal modelling accuracy, but ultimately it is the lumped parameter nature of the thermal models developed that makes MySolver succeed as a reliable quick feedback electrical machine thermal design tool, validated using experimental results for a wide range of operating conditions. The initial part of the thesis analyses the electrical machine thermal modelling techniques available today, indicating advantages and disadvantages associated with each one, and providing a rationale for the selection of lumped parameter modelling to be used by MySolver. The development of the synchronous generator lumped parameter thermal models is detailed, with examples on its construction presented.

40|$|Induction {{machines}} convert {{more than}} 55 % of electrical energy into various other forms in industrial and domestic environments. Improved performance, especially {{by reduction of}} losses in induction machines hence can significantly reduce consumption of electricity. Many design and control methods are adopted to make induction machines work more efficiently, however certain design compromises are inevitable, such as skewing the rotor to improve the magnetic noise and torque characteristics increase the cross current losses considerably in a cage rotor, degrading {{the efficiency of the}} motor. Crosscurrent losses are the dominating stray losses which are dependent on several factors among them are percentage skew and the contact resistance between the <b>rotor</b> bars and <b>laminations.</b> It is shown in this thesis that implementing a design change which has non-skewed asymmetrical distribution of rotor slots can serve the same purpose as skewing i. e., reduction of the magnetic noise, thereby avoiding the negative effects of skewing the rotor slots especially by reducing the cross-current losses. Two design ethodologies to introduce asymmetry in rotor slots are proposed and the key performance characteristics like torque ripple, radial air gap forces are computed both numerically and analytically. Radial forces obtained from the finite element method are coupled to the analytical tool forcalculating the magnetic noise. A spectral method to calculate and separate the radial forces into vibration modes and their respective frequencies is proposed and validated for a standard 4 -pole induction motor. The influence of rotor slot number, eccentricity and skew on radial forces and magnetic noise are studied using finite element method {{in order to understand the}} vibrational and acoustic behavior of the machine, especially for identifying their sources. The validated methods on standard motors are applied for investigating the asymmetrical rotor slot machines. Radial air gap forces and magnetic noise spectra are computed for the novel dual and sinusoidal symmetrical rotors and compared with the standard symmetrical rotor. The results obtained showed reduced radial forces and magnetic noise in asymmetrical rotors, both for the eccentric and noneccentric cases. Based on the results obtained some guide lines for designing  asymmetrical rotor slots are established. Magnitudes of the harmful modes of vibration observed in the eccentric rotors, which usually occur in reality, are considerably reduced in asymmetrical rotors showing lower sound intensity levels produced by asymmetrical rotors. The noise level from mode- 2 vibration in a 4 -pole standard 15 kW motor running with 25 % static eccentricity is decreased by about 6 dB, compared to the standard rotors. Hence improved performance can be achieved by removing skew which reduces cross current losses and by employing asymmetrical rotor slots same noise level can be maintained or can be even lowered.    QC 2011022...|$|R
40|$|Rotors {{supported}} by active magnetic bearings under contact-free levitation have many advantages, such as allowing near frictionless rotation and high rotational speeds. They also provide the designer {{the capability to}} achieve increased machine power density. However, magnetic bearings possess limited load capacity and operate under active control. Under certain operational conditions, the load capacity may be exceeded or a transient fault may occur. Touchdown bearings or bushes are required in such systems, from the operational and design points of view, to prevent contact between the <b>rotor</b> and stator <b>laminations</b> causing damage to the system. Rotor/touchdown bearing contact can occur in fault conditions and under external disturbances, even if the magnetic bearings are fully functional. If the rotor makes contact with the touchdown bearings, the ensuing rotor dynamics may result in transient or sustained contact dynamics. These dynamics involve transmitting a range of stresses under distortional strains. Such stresses occur under different contact modes, can be of very short or long duration, and can affect {{the life span of}} touchdown bearings. Touchdown bearings thus characterise significant safety and reliability aspects of active magnetic bearing systems. Maximisation of the performance and operational life of magnetic bearing systems dictates the need for minimisation of rotor/touchdown bearing contact. Magnetic bearing forces may have the capability to restore contact-free rotor levitation, though this will require appropriate control strategies to be devised. An understanding of the contact dynamics is required, together with the relationship between these and magnetic bearing control forces. In this thesis, rotor/touchdown bearing contact conditions are identified and investigated dynamically. An active magnetic bearing system with a long flexible rotor is considered. A nonlinear system model is employed, and a speed range covering three of the rotor’s critical frequencies is taken into account. Different types of transient and steady-state contact modes are identified, including non-persistent and persistent trapped contact modes of varying contact force levels and time durations. Design methodology is presented for a force measurement system capable of providing rotor/touchdown bearing contact force related data, based on experimental strain measurement. The system is implemented and a calibration method of assessing magnetic bearing forces based on rotor/touchdown bearing contact is demonstrated. The frequency dependent behaviour of the active magnetic bearing system is considered using evaluated force and phase measurements. Force measurements covering one of the rotor’s critical speeds are experimentally validated using an open-loop control strategy, aimed at attenuating rotor vibration in contact cases. Rotor recovery from a persistent rub contact mode through employing synchronous active magnetic bearing forces is demonstrated and discussed. The range of magnetic bearing control forces capable of contact elimination is also explored for different running speeds. The new control method presented provides insight into potential control methods capable of achieving rotor/touchdown bearing contact recovery utilizing experimental force data in contact conditions. This will contribute towards improving safety and reliability aspects of active magnetic bearing systems, which undergo operational conditions leading to rotor/touchdown bearing contact...|$|R
