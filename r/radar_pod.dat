2500|$|The {{production}} interceptor {{versions of}} the Twin Mustang were designated the F-82F and F-82G; the distinguishing feature between the F and G models was largely the nacelle beneath the center-wing that housed radar equipment (F-82F's AN/APG-28 and F-82G's SCR-720C18). In addition, the interceptor version required numerous modifications. The right side cockpit was replaced with a radar operator's position without flight controls. A long <b>radar</b> <b>pod,</b> resembling a sausage and irreverently known as a [...] "long dong", {{was attached to the}} underside of the center wing, below the six [...] machine guns and with its dish in front of the propellers to prevent signal interference. This unconventional arrangement was found not to affect the aircraft's performance seriously. Additionally the unit could be jettisoned in an emergency, or for belly landings – it was sometimes even lost during high-G maneuvers. F-82F models were designated for ADC units in the United States, while the F-82G models were deployed to Far East Air Forces for air defense of Japan and Okinawa. No F-82s were deployed to Europe.|$|E

The aircraft can carry various other AAMs, {{a wide variety of}} air-to-ground missiles, rockets or bombs; electronic countermeasures (ECM), navigation, targeting or weapons pods; and fuel tanks on 9 hardpoints – six under the wings, two on wingtips, and one under the fuselage.

50|$|The GD/Westinghouse {{design was}} even smaller, with a multiple-pulse pure solid rocket motor. It {{also had an}} {{inertial}} guidance system, but midcourse updating was provided via a dual-band semi-active radar. Terminal guidance was via an electro-optical sensor, with a backup infrared seeker also included. One flaw of semi-active radar homing is that the launch aircraft must illuminate the target with its radar during flight, meaning that it must fly towards the enemy and so expose itself to greater danger. GD/Westinghouse planned to avoid this by equipping the launching aircraft with a <b>radar</b> <b>pod</b> which could illuminate the target from both forward and aft, allowing it to turn and escape whilst still providing a target for the missile.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was found}} that the RADAR-equipped wartime Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighter was {{effective}} in locating and attacking the incoming SAC bombers, and also had the range to attack the bombers far from their intended targets. In the late 1940s, there were no suitable jet U.S. interceptors yet developed, so the P-61 was transitioned into the ADC interceptor mission. The F-61s available, however, were largely war-weary and the night fighter F-82C/D models were modified into an all-weather interceptor to replace them.The production interceptor versions of the Twin Mustang were designated the F-82F and F-82G; the distinguishing feature between the F and G models was largely the nacelle beneath the center-wing that housed radar equipment (F-82F's AN/APG-28 and F-82G's SCR-720C18).

5000|$|An AC-130H Spectre, Nail 22, flew a {{reconnaissance}} mission {{over the}} peak {{prior to the}} landing and saw no enemy activity, but it was called away to support other troops before Razor 03 and 04 arrived at the landing zone; MAKO 30 team leader was uneasy at {{the speed with which}} the sweep was conducted and wondered whether they had the right mountain but he dismissed his doubts and trusted the Spectre's technology. At around 0245 hours, as Razor 03 flared to land at the LZ and was immediately fired upon by machinegun and RPGs, an RPG struck just behind the cockpit, starting a fire in the cabin. As machinegun rounds penetrated the unarmored Chinook, another RPG, seconds after the first, hit the Chinooks right-side <b>radar</b> <b>pod,</b> which blew out all electrical power to the helicopter, particularly its miniguns and navigational systems. The Chinook was hit by a further 2 RPGs and more heavy automatic weapons fire from at least three distinct firing points (particularly from a supposedly abandoned DShK position). The Chinook set down at a slight depression, shielding the pilots from the DShK's fire. The pilot made the call to take stricken helicopter off; as he brought the Chinook back into the air, PO1 Neil C. Roberts fell out of the open ramp. One SOAR crewman grabbed hold of his pack but lost his grip. Razor 03 attempted to return and retrieve him, but the damage prevented proper control and the helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing in the valley about 11 kilometers (7 mi) away. Roberts fell 10ft into the snow covering Takur Ghar and activated his infrared strobe to mark his position. Razor 04 returned to the peak to attempt to rescue Roberts, as the Chinook offloaded MAKO 30, they came under immediate fire from the DShK, though it was relatively unscathed and left the AO after MAKO 30 successfully disembarked. At first, the terrorists didn't spot MAKO 30 in the early morning darkness, MAKO 30 split up into two-man pairs to conduct bounding movement and they were making good ground until the enemy spotted them. One team ran across a concealed al-Qaeda bunker and killed 3 fighters before the SEALs were suppressed by other fighters with PKM machine gun. The firefight lasted 20 minutes before the team leader decided to order his team to break contact, USAF combat controller Technical Sergeant John A. Chapman and two SEALs were wounded. Mako 30 was forced off the peak due to its losses and requested the assistance of the quick-reaction force made up on mainly Rangers from the 1st Battalion Ranger located at Bagram Air Base, led by Captain Nate Self. Technical Sergeant Chapman was mistakenly believed to have been killed prior to Mako 30 withdrawing from the peak. Alone and wounded, facing superiors numbers of enemy insurgents, drone footage showed Sergeant Chapman killing {{at least two of the}} insurgents, one in hand-to-hand combat, before being killed himself.|$|E

40|$|The UAVSAR instrument, {{which employs}} an L-band {{actively}} electronically scanned antenna, has begun collecting engineer-ing and science data after {{nearly three years}} of development. The radar system design was motivated by solid Earth appli-cations where repeat pass radar interferometry {{can be used to}} measure subtle deformation of the surface. However flexibility and extensibility to support other applications and different platforms were also major design drivers.

40|$|The NASA Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) {{program is}} {{developing}} a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for ground measurements. A key element {{for the success of}} this program is a Platform Precision Autopilot (PPA). An interim vehicle (NASA C- 20 AJGlll) was selected to carry the <b>radar</b> <b>pod</b> and develop the PPA. The PPA interfaces with the C- 20 AIG Ill aircraft by imitating the output of an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach. This technique retains the safeguards in the aircraft's autopilot. The PPA entered initial flight testing in early 2007. The PPA uses a Kalman filter to generate a real-time position solution with information from the C- 20 AIGIII and a real-time differential GPS unit designed by JPL. The real-time navigation solution is used to compute commands (Guidance and Control subsystems) which in turn drive two modified ILS testers. The ILS tester units produce modulated RF signals fed to the onboard navigation receiver. These correction signals allow the C- 20 NGIII autopilot to fly a simulated ILS approach that meets the PPA requirements for UAVSAR applications. The PPA requirement is to make repeat pass flights within a ten meter tube over a 200 kilometer course in conditions of cairn to light turbulence.
