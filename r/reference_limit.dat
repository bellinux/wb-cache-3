Procedures: From a cohort of 970 consecutive patients, we identified 182 patients with a clinical diagnosis of non-degenerative parkinsonism or tremor and a visually normal DATSCAN®. Caudate nucleus (C), putamen (P), and striatum (S) uptake values, C/P ratios, and asymmetry indexes (AI) were calculated using semi-quantitative methods. Outcomes were assessed according to age and gender, and <b>reference</b> <b>limits</b> were established using the percentile approach. Results: A significant negative linear effect of age was found upon striatal nuclei uptake of 0. 21 – 0. 22 per decade (6. 8 %/decade for striatum), whereas a potential gender influence proved unclear. Inferior <b>reference</b> <b>limits</b> were established at the 5 th percentile. C/P ratios and AIs were not influenced by age or gender, and superior <b>reference</b> <b>limits</b> were set at the 95 th percentile. Conclusions: We here propose a convenient approach to calculate site-specific <b>reference</b> <b>limits</b> for DaTSCAN® outcomes not requiring scanning healthy controls.

In this study, we addressed the issue of defining <b>reference</b> <b>limits</b> for cerebrospinal fluid tau and Abeta 42 in healthy adult individuals. One hundred and five neurologically intact subjects were enrolled according to strict inclusion criteria, 10 of them with autopsy confirmation of brain integrity. All cerebrospinal fluid samples were similarly and optimally processed as were the dosage methods used and the statistical analyses performed. A robust correlation with age was demonstrated for Abeta 42 but not for tau. For tau, we found that an upper cut-off value of 443 ng/l allowed 95 % of the subjects to be correctly classified as normal. For Abeta 42, a lower cut-off value of 90 ng/l allowed a correct classification of 90 % of the subjects. However, a large variance of the reference values, partly explained by the potential contamination of the reference population with presymptomatic dementia patients, may limit the use of <b>reference</b> <b>limits</b> based on living subjects. We propose that the issue of defining <b>reference</b> <b>limits</b> for both cerebrospinal fluid tau and Abeta 42 may ultimately be settled by studying large numbers of autopsy-proven neurologically intact individuals only...|$|R

METHODS: We compared plasma concentrations of free metanephrines in samples from patients with primary hypertension obtained after supine rest with those {{obtained in the}} sitting position without preceding rest. We also assessed the effects on diagnostic test performance retrospectively in patients with and without pheochromocytoma, and we calculated cost-effectiveness for pheochromocytoma testing. RESULTS: Upper <b>reference</b> <b>limits</b> of plasma free metanephrines were higher in samples obtained from seated patients without preceding rest than from supine patients with preceding rest. Application of these higher upper <b>reference</b> <b>limits</b> to samples from supine patients with pheochromocytoma decreased the diagnostic sensitivity from 99 % to 96 %. In patients without pheochromocytoma, adjusting the plasma concentration {{for the effects of}} sitting while preserving the 99 % sensitivity by use of the supine upper <b>reference</b> <b>limits</b> increased the number of false-positive test results from 9 % to 25 %. CONCLUSIONS: To preserve high diagnostic sensitivity we recommend the use of upper <b>reference</b> <b>limits</b> determined from blood samples collected in the supine position. Under these conditions, negative test results for blood samples obtained with patients sitting are as effective for ruling out pheochromocytoma as negative results from samples obtained after supine rest.

SETTING: The present study was conducted within the Eindhoven Perimenopausal Osteoporosis Study which is a large prospective cohort of 8503 community-derived women {{of the city of}} Eindhoven, The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Cases were defined as Eindhoven Perimenopausal Osteoporosis Study participants who provided an adequate baseline blood sample and subsequently experienced death during follow-up between 1994 and 2003. In total, 123 cases were identified. For each case two matched controls were selected using age, body mass index and hypertension as matching factors. The gender specific 99 th percentile <b>reference</b> <b>limit</b> determined in the 246 controls was 8. 0 ng/l. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All cause mortality. RESULTS: Hs-cTnT was significantly higher in the cases: 3. 0 ng/l versus 2. 3 ng/l (p= 0. 04). After adjustment for matching and clinical risk factors, each 1 SD increase of the level of hs-cTnT was significantly associated with mortality (OR 1. 3, 95 % CI 1. 1 to 1. 7, p= 0. 018). With amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in the multivariable model as a continuous variable the association of hs-cTnT with mortality was lost. With both hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP as dichotomous variables, the gender specific 99 th percentile <b>reference</b> <b>limit</b> (8. 0 ng/l) was associated with mortality, independent of NT-proBNP (OR 3. 7, 95 % CI 1. 0 to 13. 2, p= 0. 048).

40|$|Background: According to {{international}} recommendations, reference intervals should be determined {{from at least}} 120 reference individuals, which often are impossible to achieve in veterinary clinical pathology, especially for wild animals. When {{only a small number}} of reference subjects is available, the possible bias cannot be known and the normality of the distribution cannot be evaluated. A comparison of reference intervals estimated by different methods could be helpful. Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare <b>reference</b> <b>limits</b> determined from a large set of canine plasma creatinine reference values, and large subsets of this data, with estimates obtained from small samples selected randomly. Methods: Twenty sets each of 120 and 27 samples were randomly selected from a set of 1439 plasma creatinine results obtained from healthy dogs in another study. Reference intervals for the whole sample and for the large samples were determined by a nonparametric method. The estimated <b>reference</b> <b>limits</b> for the small samples were minimum and maximum, mean +/- 2 SD of native and Box–Cox-transformed values, 2. 5 th and 97. 5 th percentiles by a robust method on native and Box–Cox-transformed values, and estimates from diagrams of cumulative distribution functions. Results: The whole sample had a heavily skewed distribution, which approached Gaussian after Box–Cox transformation.

METHODS: Plasma homocysteine cut-off values were retrospectively used for hyperhomocysteinemia assessment in 3477 subjects with past tHcy test indications and 177 apparently healthy subjects. Cut-off values were based on <b>reference</b> <b>limits</b> (f-tHcy < or = 15. 0; postload-tHcy < or = 50. 0 micro mol/l), relative risk (f-tHcy < or = 12. 0, postload-tHcy < or = 38. 0; or f-tHcy < or = 10. 0 micro mol/l) and vitamin-optimized <b>reference</b> <b>limits</b> (f-tHcy < or = 9. 3; postload-tHcy < or = 35. 1 micro mol/l). RESULTS: Use of the American Heart Association 10 micro mol/l f-tHcy cut-off value gave hyperhomocysteinemia prevalences of 65 % in subjects with past tHcy test indications and 50 % in healthy subjects. The combination of the vitamin-optimized <b>reference</b> <b>limits</b> for f-tHcy and postload-tHcy gave a hyperhomocysteinemia prevalence of 79 % in subjects with tHcy test indications, of which only 5 % was on account of increased postload-tHcy.
