5|$|All of Uranus's moons {{are named}} after {{characters}} from {{the works of}} William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope's The <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> the Lock. The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by John Herschel in 1852 {{at the request of}} Lassell. Ariel is named after the leading sylph in The <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> the Lock. It is also the name of the spirit who serves Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The moon is also designated UranusI.|$|E

50|$|Are {{countries}} such as South Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo or India the <b>rape</b> capitals <b>of</b> the world? According to Africa Check, it is not currently possible to make such comparisons because different countries have different legal definitions <b>of</b> <b>rape,</b> methods <b>of</b> collecting data <b>of</b> <b>rapes,</b> and levels <b>of</b> reporting <b>rape.</b> All <b>of</b> these issues make exact comparisons <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> rates across countries because the data a currently too unreliable.|$|R
50|$|The Local Government Act 1888 {{created the}} {{administrative}} county of West Sussex, {{with its own}} county council, from the three western <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> the ancient county of Sussex, that is the <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> Chichester, Arundel and Bramber. With {{the exception of the}} three county boroughs of Brighton, Hastings and Eastbourne, the three eastern <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings came under the control of East Sussex County Council. Until 1898 it existed alongside the Urban and Rural Sanitary Districts, when these were abolished in favour of a new network or urban and rural districts.|$|R

5|$|Also in the 18th century, between 1716 and 1719, {{the poet}} Alexander Pope, author of The <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> the Lock, lived in Chiswick – in the {{building}} which is now the Mawson Arms {{at the corner of}} Mawson Lane. Another 18th-century resident was the actor Charles Holland, who was born in Chiswick in 1733.|$|E
5|$|During the war Bengali nationalists also {{committed}} mass <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> ethnic Bihari Muslim women, {{since the}} Bihari Muslim community supported Pakistan. Indian soldiers {{as well as}} Bengali millitiamen were also identified as perpetrators of rape by scholar Yasmin Saikia.|$|E
5|$|In Gortyn, in Crete, {{according}} to a code engraved in stone dating to the 6th century BC, slaves (doulos or oikeus) {{found themselves in a}} state of great dependence. Their children belonged to the master. The master was responsible for all their offences, and, inversely, he received amends for crimes committed against his slaves by others. In the Gortyn code, where all punishment was monetary, fines were doubled for slaves committing a misdemeanour or felony. Conversely, an offence committed against a slave was much less expensive than an offence committed against a free person. As an example, the <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> a free woman by a slave was punishable by a fine of 200 staters (400 drachms), while the <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> a non-virgin slave by another slave brought a fine of only one obolus (a sixth of a drachm).|$|E

50|$|A 1992 study <b>of</b> {{reported}} <b>rapes</b> {{in inner-city}} and suburban Johannesburg, South Africa found 80% <b>of</b> <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> adult women were perpetrated by strangers, often {{by men who}} abducted them at gunpoint {{on their way to}} work or broke into their houses. However, the majority <b>of</b> <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> girls under 16 years of age were perpetrated by people known to them, usually family or friends, and sometimes gang members.|$|R
5|$|In both Feuchtwanger's {{novel and}} Harlan's film, the {{dramatic}} climax is rape. However, Feuchtwanger posits that Süß has a hidden daughter whom the duke discovers, rapes and who then dies by drowning. The novel then focuses on Süß's {{grappling with the}} desire for revenge and the tragedy resulting from his decision to exact vengeance {{for the loss of}} his daughter. Harlan replaced the <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> Süß's daughter by the duke with Süß's <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> an Aryan woman, thus completely inverting Feuchtwanger's plot device from a father's tragic quest for vengeance to the punishment of a Jew for having sexual relations with a Christian.|$|E
5|$|Martial also {{suggests}} the <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> a woman by a bull in a {{re-creation of the}} myth of Pasiphaë.

50|$|The Local Government Act 1888 {{introduced}} administrative counties each {{governed by}} an elected county council. Sussex {{was divided into}} two administrative counties: With {{the exception of the}} county boroughs of Brighton, Hastings and from 1911, Eastbourne, East Sussex County Council administered the <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings, while West Sussex County Council administered the <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> Chichester, Arundel and Bramber. Each county council was required to adopt a common seal.|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{usefulness}} of the feminist theory in explaining atti- tudes toward <b>rape</b> and victims <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> in Ghana. The feminist theory <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> posits, inter alia, that patriarchy and gender inequality are major factors in the aetiology <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> and attitudes toward rape and that underlying patriarchy and gender inequality are gender stereotypes and false beliefs (myths) about rape, rapists, and victims <b>of</b> <b>rape.</b> Thus, the theory suggests a relationship between rape myths and less favorable attitudes toward <b>rape</b> and victims <b>of</b> <b>rape.</b> Results from a survey conducted in Ghana show some support for the feminist theory of rape: There is evidence <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> myth acceptance in Ghana; gender is significant in predicting levels <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> myth acceptance; and finally, education or profession and age, but not religion, are associated with levels <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> myth acceptance in a predictable way...|$|R
50|$|The Rapes may {{be grouped}} in regions, most {{commonly}} two geographic divisions within Sussex. The <b>Rapes</b> <b>of</b> Arundel, Bramber and Chichester comprised Sussex's western division; the <b>Rapes</b> <b>of</b> Hastings, Lewes and Pevensey comprised Sussex's eastern division. These divisions {{formed the basis of}} the areas administered by East and West Sussex County Councils and the non-metropolitan counties of East Sussex and West Sussex that were created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972.|$|R

5|$|In 1593 and 1594, {{when the}} theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare {{published}} two narrative poems on sexual themes, Venus and Adonis and The <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> Lucrece. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in The <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin. Influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses, the poems show the guilt and moral confusion {{that result from}} uncontrolled lust. Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime. A third narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in {{the first edition of}} the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover's Complaint. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects. The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 Love's Martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission.|$|E
5|$|In the novel's final chapters, {{the three}} storylines {{intersect}} with increasing frequency. The tone of these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture {{and death of}} the assassins {{at the hands of}} the SIM, the failure of the coup, the <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> Urania, and the concessions made to Trujillo's most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then escape the country. The book ends as Urania prepares to return home, determined this time to keep in touch with her family back on the island.|$|E

5|$|Like his {{political}} career, Kogălniceanu's tracts focused on condemning Austrian ethnic and territorial policies. Also in 1875, he issued from Paris an anti-Austrian brochure about the Romanian cause in Bukovina. Called Rapt de la Bukovine d'après les documents authentiques ("The <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> Bukovina, from Genuine Documents"), it reused old texts {{collected by the}} Hurmuzachis. The propaganda effort won support from across the floor: Junimea Conservatives (Titu Maiorescu, Theodor Rosetti, Ioan Slavici), National Liberals (D. Sturdza) and independents (Alexandru Odobescu) all signed up to the enterprise.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} renowned works he ordered was the raising of the Sigismund's Column in Warsaw.

Among other works sponsored by or dedicated to him is Guido Reni's The <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> Europa.|$|E
5|$|Tales of love often involve incest, or the {{seduction}} or <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> a mortal woman {{by a male}} god, resulting in heroic offspring. The stories generally suggest that relationships between gods and mortals are something to avoid; even consenting relationships rarely have happy endings. In a few cases, a female divinity mates with a mortal man, as in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, where the goddess lies with Anchises to produce Aeneas.|$|E
