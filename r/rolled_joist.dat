50|$|The Dalby Herald {{described}} the new convent as Gothic in style, {{standing on a}} large site, on solid foundations four feet deep, reinforced with <b>rolled</b> <b>joists,</b> bolted together under all {{the walls of the}} structure, creating a singular solid frame. Entry to the property was through ornamental iron gates composed of crosses with the name St Columba's Convent emblazoned on them in brass. A gravelled path led to the central main entrance, which had a simple gabled portico again lettered with the name of St Columba's. The front verandah featured sections of cast iron balustrade and all were ten feet wide. Flooring throughout was crows ash.|$|R

5|$|Around 1876, {{railways}} {{around the}} world began to use steel, instead of malleable iron, for rails. As a result, production at Consett fell by a third. The company switched production to iron plates, demand for which was rising rapidly for shipbuilding. In 1882, Consett Iron Company began to switch production again, this time to steel plates for shipbuilding using the Siemens-Martin process. This uses open hearth furnaces to convert pig iron to steel by burning off excess carbon. The first Siemens furnaces at Consett came into production in 1883. In 1887 the company began to produce steel {{in a variety of}} cross-sections, such as angle (L-section) steel, <b>rolled</b> <b>joists</b> and girders for shipbuilding. For this purpose it created the Angle Mills on a sixteen-acre site, able to produce 1500 tons of angles, bars and girders per week.|$|R
50|$|The Downing Street {{front is}} of Ancaster stone with rusticated Derbyshire stone dressings. The {{northern}} rear elevation is in brick with stone dressings. The floors are of jointless cement, and {{the roof is}} supported by a <b>rolled</b> steel <b>joist</b> system. Prior paid great attention to the roof design to minimize potential dirt traps, ensuring that not even a rivet projected as a potential collecting area.|$|R
5000|$|The Luggate 'Grandview Bridge' {{is a local}} icon listed highly in the Queenstown Lakes District Council's Historic Register. It {{was opened}} on October 28, 1915, and has been {{described}} as [...] "one of the most attractively proportioned steel truss road bridges in the country." [...] It is 103.7 metres long, and features a 61-metre Baltimore through truss, another 30.5m truss and a 12.2m <b>rolled</b> steel <b>joist</b> end span.|$|R

The {{horizontal}} elements of the [...] "" [...] are known as flanges, while the vertical element is termed the [...] "web". I-beams are usually made of structural steel and are used in construction and civil engineering.|$|R
50|$|The {{basement}} {{walls were}} constructed in brick and measure between 450mm and 500mm thick. All internal partitions were in solid brickwork and the pitched roof was supported on timber trusses. The ground floor is supported on <b>rolled</b> steel <b>joists</b> at 2.2m centres with concrete barrel vault arches spanning between. Tongue and groove flooring was the floor finish {{in most of}} the building, except the banking hall which had a marble floor. The banking hall had a ceiling of ornate plasterwork, other ceilings were in pressed metal sheet.|$|R
50|$|The outer {{approach}} spans {{of timber}} longitudinals {{are supported by}} common timber trestles, both braced and unbraced. The inner approach spans are of riveted continuous <b>rolled</b> steel <b>joists</b> and riveted deck-type continuous plate girders and underslung cross girders supported on concrete piers. The two mains spans are each of 150 feet (45.7 metres). They are riveted 13-panel double-intersection through Pratt trusses (Whipple trusses) supported on concrete piers. The stylistic concrete piers are cement rendered. There are dressed stone cutwaters embedded in concrete to the upstream leading edges.|$|R
5000|$|The six new bells, {{the largest}} {{weighing}} 63,4cwt in B flat, {{all have the}} inscription [...] "RECAST BY JOHN WARNER & SONS LONDON 1891". They are hung for ringing {{in the base of}} the spire in a frame of iron castings bolted to timber foundation beams, probably the same beams which supported the old bells. In 1970 the bells were sent to the Whitechapel Bell Foundry to be retuned and rehung with new bearings and pulleys. In the year 2000 the bells were again removed from the frame so that it and the bell fittings could be refurbished. Two <b>rolled</b> steel <b>joists</b> were installed to provide additional support to the bellframe.|$|R
50|$|The {{existing}} ceiling joists in most {{houses are}} only designed {{to support the}} weight of a ceiling, therefore additional support will be required to transfer the loads from the new loft floor to the walls of the house, since the alignment of roof supports would generally need to be altered, causing a significant increase in pressure at specific points on the flooring of the property. The most common method used is to install I-beams or <b>rolled</b> steel <b>joists</b> (RSJs), these can either be installed in single lengths or in smaller sections which are bolted together. New timber joists are then installed between the RSJs onto which the new floor can be laid. A structural engineer will calculate the size of the RSJs and joists.|$|R
500|$|The {{simplest}} of the removable roadblocks consisted of concrete cylinders {{of various sizes}} but typically about [...] high and [...] in diameter; these could be manhandled into position as required. However, these would be insufficient to stop armoured vehicles. One common type of removable anti-tank roadblock comprised a pair of massive concrete buttresses permanently installed at the roadside; these buttresses had holes and/or slots to accept horizontal railway lines or <b>rolled</b> steel <b>joists</b> (RSJs). Similar blocks were placed across railway tracks because tanks can move along tracks almost as easily as they can along roads. These blocks would be placed strategically where {{it was difficult for}} a vehicle to go around—anti-tank obstacles and mines being positioned as required—and they could be opened or closed within a matter of minutes.|$|R
50|$|I-beams are {{commonly}} made of structural steel {{but may also}} be formed from aluminium or other materials. A common type of I-beam is the <b>rolled</b> steel <b>joist</b> (RSJ)—sometimes incorrectly rendered as reinforced steel joist. British and European standards also specify Universal Beams (UBs) and Universal Columns (UCs). These sections have parallel flanges, {{as opposed to the}} varying thickness of RSJ flanges which are seldom now rolled in the UK. Parallel flanges are easier to connect to and do away with the need for tapering washers. UCs have equal or near-equal width and depth and are more suited to being oriented vertically to carry axial load such as columns in multi-storey construction, while UBs are significantly deeper than they are wide are more suited to carrying bending load such as beam elements in floors.|$|R

5000|$|Garratt Road Bridge {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} bridges across the Swan River, between Bayswater and Ascot. The upstream bridge, from 1935, carries southbound traffic, pedestrians, and two pipes, while northbound traffic travels on the 1970 downstream bridge. Both bridges are predominantly constructed from timber, and feature [...] "timber piles driven into the river bed linked with timber cross bracing and double beams top and bottom and then spanned by timber logs which in turn support the wooden decking". The original bridge is at a lower height, and some of its beams have been replaced by <b>Rolled</b> Steel <b>Joists.</b> While both bridges have modern steel safety rails, the original white-painted wooden rail is still present along the pedestrian path. The original bridge has approximately 38 spans over 37 piers, along a 238 m length.|$|R
5000|$|It {{would seem}} that nothing more was heard until 17 March 1896 when, {{at a meeting of}} the same committee, several sets of {{drawings}} were submitted as plans for the 'assembly rooms or concert hall' to be built: at Stroud Green between Stapleton Hall road and Mount Pleasant road. The premises would consist, on the ground floor of four shops, and on the first floor of a hall for which it was intended to apply for a music and dancing licence. The shops would have fireproof ceilings constructed of <b>rolled</b> iron <b>joist</b> and concrete separating them from the hall, which would have seating capacity for 280 persons. There would be two staircases delivering from the hall, one into Stapleton Hall road, and the other into Mount Pleasant road. The Era (London, England), Saturday, 21 March 1896; Issue 3000 ...|$|R
5000|$|The Sadliers Crossing Railway Bridge is a two span Whipple {{truss bridge}} with {{continuous}} <b>rolled</b> steel <b>joists.</b> It {{is the second}} longest span of its type in Queensland (45.7 metres), the longest being the former Burdekin River Rail Bridge at Macrossan. The Whipple truss was developed by Squire (CE) Whipple as a stronger version of the Pratt truss that was designed by Thomas and Caleb Pratt in 1844. The basic identifying features of the Pratt truss are the diagonal web members which form a V-shape. The centre section commonly has crossing diagonal members. The Pratt truss and its variations {{are the most common}} type of all trusses. One of these variations is the Whipple truss, which was patented in 1847, and is also known as the [...] "Double-intersection Pratt" [...] because the diagonal tension members cross two panels, while those on the Pratt cross one. The Whipple truss was popular with the railroads as it was stronger and more rigid than the Pratt.|$|R
5000|$|In July 1924 {{the patent}} {{application}} for the pole design was submitted in both English and French, and accepted in November 1925. Stobie described his invention as"an improved pole adopted {{to be used}} for very many purposes, but particularly for carrying electric cables, telegraph wires... it consists of two flanged beams of iron or steel, preferably <b>rolled</b> steel <b>joist</b> of ''''H'''' or of channel sections, placed one beside the other with their flanges inward and preferably at a very slight angle one with the other and held together by means of tie bolts, the space between them being filled with cement concrete." [...] Stobie and John Brookman were so confident of the new pole that they formed The Stobie Pole Syndicate for the purpose of patenting the design and then selling the patent or manufacturing rights. The Hume Pipe Company became their first agents and, while there were numerous international enquiries, South Australia has largely remained the only place where they are widely used.|$|R
5000|$|A linear shaped charge (LSC) has {{a lining}} with V-shaped profile and varying length. The lining is {{surrounded}} with explosive, the explosive then encased within a suitable material that serves {{to protect the}} explosive and to confine (tamp) it on detonation. [...] "At detonation, the focusing of the explosive high pressure wave as it becomes incident to the side wall causes the metal liner of the LSC to collapse-creating the cutting force." [...] The detonation projects into the lining, to form a continuous, knife-like (planar) jet. The jet cuts any material in its path, to a depth {{depending on the size}} and materials used in the charge. For the cutting of complex geometries, there are also flexible versions of the linear shaped charge, these with a lead or high-density foam sheathing and a ductile/flexible lining material, which also is often lead. LSCs are commonly used in the cutting of <b>rolled</b> steel <b>joists</b> (RSJ) and other structural targets, such as in the controlled demolition of buildings. LSCs are also used to separate the stages of multistage rockets.|$|R
5000|$|Sybil {{returns the}} next morning to find the renovations have been {{completed}} by O'Reilly, apparently with no problems. As Stubbs arrives, Sybil finds herself in an embarrassing situation at having called on him, seemingly now for nothing. Stubbs looks over the renovations and admits at first that whoever did them did a very good job. However, when Stubbs further questions Basil about the work, it turns out he may have been needed after all. Whilst making a doorway leading into the kitchen, O'Reilly only used a wooden lintel as opposed to a concrete one or <b>Rolled</b> Steel <b>Joist.</b> Since the door to the kitchen is on a load-bearing wall, the supporting wall could give way at any moment and cause the entire building to collapse. As Stubbs goes to telephone his company for the necessary equipment to commence immediate repair work, Sybil looks furiously for Basil and finds him marching down the driveway with the garden gnome. Basil calls back to Sybil that he is [...] "going to see Mr. O'Reilly, dear!" [...] before adding [...] "and then I think I might go to Canada" [...] under his breath.|$|R

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the behaviour of thin webbed <b>rolled</b> steel <b>joists</b> or universal beams when they are subjected to concentrated loads applied to the flanges. The prime concern is the effect of high direct stresses causing web failure in a small region of the beam. The review shows that although many tests have been carried out on rolled steel beams and built up girders, no series of tests has restricted the number of variables involved to enable firm conclusions to be drawn. The results of 100 tests on several different rolled steel universal beam sections having various types of loading conditions are presented. The majority of the beams are tested by loading with two opposite loads, thus eliminating the effects of bending and shear, except for a small number of beams which are tested simply supported on varying spans. The test results are first compared with the present design standard (BS 449) and it is shown that the British Standard is very conservative for most of the loading conditions included in the tests but is unsafe for others. Three possible failure modes are then considered, overall elastic buckling of the web, flexural yielding of the web due to large out of plane deflexions and local crushing of the material at the junction of the web and the root fillets. Each mode is considered theoretically and developed to establish the main variables, thus enabling a comparison to be made with the test results. It is shown that all three failure modes have a particular relevance for individual loading conditions, but that determining the failure load given the beam size and the loading conditions is very difficult in certain instances. Finally it is shown that there are some empirical relationships between the failure loads and the type of loading for various beam serial sizes...|$|R
