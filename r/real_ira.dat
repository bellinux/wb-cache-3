5|$|On 3 September 2012 {{prominent}} <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> member Alan Ryan {{was shot}} dead in Dublin. Gardaí believed he {{had been involved in}} a feud with major crime gangs from whom he was trying to extort money. Following Ryan's death an internal feud developed in the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA.</b> Ryan's replacement as leader and another associate were shot and wounded in November 2012, allegedly on the orders of the Northern leadership. In March 2013, another prominent former <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> member, Peter Butterly from Dunleer, {{was shot dead}}; three Dublin men, allegedly from the Alan Ryan faction, were charged with his murder and <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> membership.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> were {{suspected}} of {{complicity in the}} murder in December 2006 of drug-dealer Martin 'Marlo' Hyland. Hyland was shot dead at his Dublin home, along with a plumber, Anthony Campbell, who was carrying out work at the house. The organisation was embroiled in a feud with Hyland's gang at the time.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014 {{the group}} sent seven letter bombs to British Army {{recruitment}} offices in south-east England; {{the first time}} republicans had struck in Britain since 2001. The following month, a PSNI landrover was hit by an explosively formed projectile in Belfast. A civilian car was also hit by debris, {{but there were no}} injuries. The <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> claimed responsibility. In November 2014, a PSNI armoured jeep was hit by another 'horizontal mortar' in Derry, and in Belfast a PSNI landrover was attacked with a homemade rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launcher.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Forbes {{magazine}} {{estimated the}} group's annual turnover at US$50 million. According {{to the police}} in Northern Ireland, the main sources of the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA's</b> funding are illegal fuel operations and various smuggling activities. Illicit cigarettes were also {{said to be a}} significant source of income for the group. There are also other significant sources of funding from the group, including funding from sympathisers based in the US and other countries.|$|R
50|$|The series ended December 18, 1946, with Margaret OBrien {{and one of}} {{the series}} {{frequent}} supporting players, Jeff Chandler (appearing under his <b>real</b> name, <b>Ira</b> Grossel) in Lost Angel.|$|R
50|$|In Northern Ireland, the Real Irish Republican Army and the Continuity Irish Republican Army, two small, radical {{splinter}} {{groups who}} broke with the Provisional Irish Republican Army, continue to exist. They are dwarfed in size by the Provisional IRA {{and have been}} less successful {{in terms of both}} popularity among Irish republicans and guerrilla activity: The Continuity IRA has failed to carry out any killings, while the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA's</b> only attacks resulting in deaths were the 1998 Omagh bombing, which killed 29 civilians, a booby trap torch bomb in Derry which killed a former Ulster Defence Regiment soldier, and a 2009 attack on a Northern Ireland military installation which killed 2 British soldiers and wounded several others.|$|R
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 20 September 2000, the {{building}} was attacked using a Russian-built RPG-22 anti-tank rocket. Striking the eighth floor, the missile caused only superficial damage. The Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch attributed responsibility to the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 4 March 2001, a bomb placed {{outside the}} news centre exploded, with no fatalities. It was {{attributed}} to the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> and the culprits were eventually caught. The {{front of the building}} suffered moderate damage, but was soon repaired.|$|E
25|$|On 7 March 2009, two off-duty British {{soldiers}} of 38 Engineer Regiment were shot dead outside Massereene Barracks in Antrim town, Northern Ireland. Two other soldiers and two civilian delivery men were also shot and wounded during the attack. An Irish republican paramilitary group, the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA,</b> claimed responsibility.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{phone calls}} were made warning {{of a bomb}} in Omagh, using the same {{codeword}} {{that had been used}} in the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA's</b> bomb attack in Banbridge two weeks earlier. At 14:32, a warning was telephoned to Ulster Television saying, [...] "There's a bomb, courthouse, Omagh, main street, 500lb, explosion 30 minutes." [...] One minute later, the office received a second warning saying, [...] "Martha Pope (which was the RIRA's code word), bomb, Omagh town, 15 minutes". The caller claimed the warning on behalf of [...] "Óglaigh na hÉireann". The next minute, the Coleraine office of the Samaritans received a call stating that a bomb would go off on [...] "main street" [...] about [...] from the courthouse. The recipients passed on the information to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).|$|R
50|$|I.Q. (<b>real</b> name: <b>Ira</b> Quimby) is {{a fictional}} supervillain in comic books {{published}} by DC Comics. He {{first appeared in}} Mystery in Space #87 (November, 1963), and was created by Gardner Fox and Carmine Infantino. I.Q. has most often appeared an enemy of Hawkman, and was most recently seen in 52.|$|R
2500|$|Having {{returned}} {{to live in}} Newry, rather than maintaining a low profile Collins {{decided to take a}} prominent role in the ongoing transition of Ulster's post-war society, using his personal history as a platform in the media to analyze the adverse effects of [...] "terrorism". In 1995 he appeared in an ITV television documentary entitled 'Confession', giving an account of his disillusioning experiences and a bleak insight into Irish paramilitarism. In 1997 he co-authored Killing Rage, with journalist Mick McGovern, a biographical account of his life and IRA career. He also contributed to the book Bandit Country by Toby Harnden about the South Armagh IRA. At the same time in the media he called for the re-introduction of Internment after the Omagh bombing for those continuing to engage in such acts; published newspaper articles openly denouncing and ridiculing the fringe <b>Real</b> <b>IRA's</b> attempts to re-ignite paramilitary warfare in Ulster, alongside publicly analyzing his own past role in such activity, and the damage that it had caused on a personal and social level to the two communities of Ulster.|$|R
25|$|The {{organization}} remains {{classified as}} a proscribed terrorist group in the UK and as an illegal organisation in the Republic of Ireland. Two small groups split from the IRA, the Continuity IRA in 1986, and the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> in 1997. Both reject the Good Friday Agreement and continue to engage in paramilitary activity.|$|E
25|$|Since the 2000s, some {{dissident}} republican {{groups have}} begun using Óglaigh na hÉireann {{as their primary}} title in both Irish- and English-language contexts. These include a Continuity IRA splinter group, first reported on by the Independent Monitoring Commission in 2006, and a <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> splinter group which began claiming responsibility for attacks in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Operations that {{utilised}} GCHQ's intelligence-gathering {{capabilities in}} the 1990s included the monitoring of communications of Iraqi {{soldiers in the}} Gulf War, of dissident republican terrorists and the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA,</b> of the various factions involved in the Yugoslav Wars, and of the criminal Kenneth Noye. In the mid 1990s GCHQ began {{to assist in the}} investigation of cybercrime.|$|E
50|$|Rani {{gives birth}} to a daughter. Ira, a ghost, {{was in love with}} Rani's husband, Kuvar Yuddishter; she came as the baby's nanny.Rani comes in {{disguise}} of an old woman Bhoomi to find out about Ira. Bhoomi finds out that <b>Ira's</b> <b>real</b> name is Mohini and about how wicked she was in her past and her home, Bhavan-bitti-ki-kotri. Ira disables Bhoomi's speech so she can't tell anyone about her evilness. After a battle, Rani manages to win and Bhoomi gets back her speech.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, the Continuity IRA was {{responsible}} for shooting dead two of its members who had left and attempted {{to create their own}} organisation. Upon leaving the CIRA, they had allegedly taken a number of guns with them. [...] The Continuity IRA is believed by Gardaí to have been involved in a number of gangland killings in Dublin and Limerick. Recent internal feuds and splits have seen organisations such as the RCIRA (<b>Real</b> Continuity <b>IRA)</b> being formed in the Limerick area and organisations such as Óglaigh na hÉireann (which ceased operating around 2009, not be confused with another more active group, also called Óglaigh na hÉireann) and Saoirse na hÉireann, a group which also ceased around that time. An RSF member remarked that splits aren't uncommon in the Continuity IRA as some individuals think they should be in a leading position of the group.|$|R
50|$|An IRA can {{purchase}} {{any type of}} real estate {{as long as the}} provider (aka custodian) of that <b>IRA</b> handles <b>real</b> estate. <b>IRA</b> providers that handle real estate are often called self-directed IRA providers. If the IRA does not have enough cash to pay the full purchase price, then the IRA can partner with a person, company/entity or another IRA, or it can secure a non-recourse loan to buy real estate. Whether the IRA is whole or part owner, IRA funds are used for purchase, maintenance, and expenses. When the property generates cash either with rental income or from sale, those funds go directly back to the IRA. The IRS prohibits certain actions. For example, neither the IRA holder nor any disqualified persons to that plan may live in or vacation in the property. The IRA holder makes the decisions about how the asset is maintained but cannot do the work themselves.|$|R
25|$|In 1997, {{several members}} of the South Armagh Brigade, based in Jonesborough and Dromintee, {{following}} Michael McKevitt, left the Provisional IRA because of its acceptance of the Mitchell Principles of non-violence at a General Army Convention in October of that year and formed a dissident grouping, the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA,</b> which rejected the peace process. Their discontent was deepened by Sinn Féin's signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Most of the South Armagh IRA stayed within the Provisional movement, but there were reports of them aiding the dissidents throughout 1998. The Omagh bombing of August 1998, a botched <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> operation which killed 29 civilians, was prepared by dissident republicans in South Armagh. Thomas Murphy and the leadership of the IRA in the area have allegedly since re-asserted their control, expelling dissidents from the district under threat of death. Michael McKevitt and his wife Bernadette were evicted from their home near Dundalk. IRA members in South Armagh ceased cooperating with the RIRA after the Omagh bombing.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012, O'Hare {{served as}} one of the pall bearers and chief mourners at the funeral of Eamon Kelly, a leading Dublin crime boss assassinated by members of the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> in revenge for the September 2012 killing of RIRA leader Alan Ryan. O'Hare was reputed to have been a {{drinking}} buddy of Kelly, whom he had befriended when both were serving time in Portlaoise Prison.|$|E
25|$|His {{contribution}} towards {{assisting the}} Northern Ireland peace process {{by helping to}} negotiate the Good Friday Agreement (after 30 years of conflict) was widely recognised. Following the Omagh bombing on 15 August 1998, {{by members of the}} <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> opposed to the peace process, which killed 29 people and wounded hundreds, Blair visited the County Tyrone town and met with victims at Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{brothers}} are still remembered today for their musical talent, {{they are also}} remembered for the unusual cover used for their 1959 album, Satan Is <b>Real.</b> Designed by <b>Ira</b> Louvin, the cover features {{the brothers}} standing in a rock quarry {{in front of a}} 12 ft plywood rendition of the Devil as several hidden tires soaked in kerosene burn behind them as fire and brimstone. While some reviewers count this as being one of the [...] "greatest iconic album covers of all time", the cover can also be found today on several Web sites celebrating unusual or bizarre album covers. The cover has also become an Internet meme on a number of Web sites such as Fark.com, where it has been posted in discussion threads as an example of religious views of the era.|$|R
50|$|Rani and Yudishter both {{die in a}} car accident, {{leaving their}} young daughter, Sandhya alone. At first, Sandhya was named Mohini but, upon realizing that <b>Ira's</b> <b>real</b> name was Mohini, they changed it. Mohini (Ira) curses Sandhiya as she dies, to seek revenge from Rani that her face becomes ugly at dusk. A new maid Sajili has come to their palace, only to steal. She has a thief son, Virendra/Viru. Viru along with his friend, Balma, pretends to be the prince Kuvar Veer to fool the royal family. Raja Sahib and Choti Rani plan a wedding with Viru and Sandhiya as they think her {{marriage}} with Virendra will break Mohini (Ira)'s spell. Rudra and Bhoomi are not shown. Kuvar Aryaman, Bhoomi and Rudhr's son, who is younger than Sandhiya, has put a man called Rajveer in Viru's place. Sandhiya has accepted her marriage with Rajveer. They both plan to seduce Sandhya.|$|R
5000|$|Jeff Chandler {{looked as}} though he had been dreamed up by one of those artists who specialise in male {{physique}} studies or, a mite further up the artistic scale, he might have been plucked bodily from some modern mural on a biblical subject. For that he had the requisite Jewishness (of which he was very proud) - and he was not quite real. Above all, he was impossibly handsome. He would never have been lost in a crowd, with that big, square, sculpted 20th century face and his prematurely grey wavy hair. If the movies had not found him the advertising agencies would have done - and in fact, whenever you saw a still of him you looked at his wrist-watch or pipe before realising that he wasn't promoting something. In the coloured stills and on posters his studio always showed his hair as blue, heightening the unreality. His <b>real</b> name was <b>Ira</b> Grossel and his film-name was exactly right.|$|R
25|$|In January 2012 Shivers {{was convicted}} of the soldiers' murders, but Duffy was acquitted. In January 2013, Shivers's {{conviction}} was overturned by Northern Ireland's highest appeals court. A May 2013 retrial found Shivers not guilty. He was cleared of all charges and immediately released from jail. The judge questioned why the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> would choose Shivers as the gunman, with his cystic fibrosis and his engagement to a Protestant woman.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{alleged that the}} British, Irish and US {{intelligence}} agencies had information which could have prevented the bombing, most of which came from double agents inside the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA.</b> This information was not given to the local police, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). In 2008 {{it was revealed that}} British intelligence agency GCHQ was monitoring conversations between the bombers as the bomb was being driven into Omagh.|$|E
25|$|On 10 October 2007, {{the lead}} {{responsibility}} {{for national security}} intelligence in Northern Ireland returned to the Security Service from the Police Service of Northern Ireland that had been devolved in 1976 to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) during Ulsterisation. During April 2010 the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> detonated a 120lb. car bomb outside Palace Barracks in County Down which is the headquarters of MI5 in Northern Ireland and also home to the 2nd Battalion The Mercian Regiment.|$|E
40|$|Following the 1998 Belfast Agreement in Northern Ireland, {{levels of}} {{paramilitary}} violence have declined substantially. Among loyalists, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and associated Red Hand Commando (RHC) have formally renounced violence, and dissolved their 'military structures', {{and perhaps the}} most reticent of all of the major paramilitary groupings, the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), has taken on board the central tenets of conflict transformation, and 'stood down' all of its 'active service units' in the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF). Thus, paramilitary violence now is mainly confined to the activities of 'dissident' republican groups, notably the <b>Real</b> and Continuity <b>IRAs,</b> although low-level sectarian violence remains a problem. Such dramatic societal and political change has resulted in a focus on the roles of formal party political leadership as agents of social change. This gaze, however, tends to obscure other important events such as the efforts, structures and approaches taken at the grassroots level to uphold and sustain conflict transformation and to maintain a reduction in violence. This article provides analysis of the role played by former loyalist paramilitary combatants in conflict transformation, and draws on material obtained through significant access to those former paramilitaries engaged in processes of societal shifts. In both personal and structural terms there is evidence of former combatants working to diminish the political tensions that remain {{as a result of the}} long-term inter-communal hostility developed across decades of violence and conflict...|$|R
25|$|Denis Martin Donaldson (1950 – 4 April 2006) was a {{volunteer}} in the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{and a member}} of Sinn Féin who was murdered following his exposure in December 2005 as an informer in the employ of MI5 and the Special Branch of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (formerly the Royal Ulster Constabulary). It was initially believed that the Provisional IRA were responsible for his killing although the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> claimed responsibility for his murder almost three years later.|$|E
25|$|The bombing caused outrage both {{locally and}} internationally, spurred on the Northern Ireland peace process, and dealt a severe {{blow to the}} {{dissident}} republican campaign. The <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> denied the bomb was intended to kill civilians and apologised; it later declared a ceasefire shortly after. The victims included people from many backgrounds: Protestants, Catholics, a Mormon teenager, five other teenagers, six children, a mother pregnant with twins, two Spanish tourists, and others on a day trip from the Republic of Ireland. Both unionists and Irish nationalists were killed and injured.|$|E
25|$|The {{name has}} also been used by several other {{paramilitary}} groups calling themselves the Irish Republican Army since 1920. These groups each {{claim to be the}} sole legitimist modern successors to the original Irish Volunteers and Irish Republican Army, and they have refused to recognise the authority of (variously) the Defence Forces, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland; as such, each of these groups claims the sole right to use the name Óglaigh na hÉireann. Such groups have included the Provisional IRA, the Continuity IRA and the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA.</b>|$|E
25|$|The party {{expelled}} Denis Donaldson, a party official, in December 2005, {{with him}} stating publicly {{that he had}} been in the employ of the British government as an agent since the 1980s. Donaldson told reporters that the British security agencies who employed him were behind the collapse of the Assembly and set up Sinn Féin to take the blame for it, a claim disputed by the British Government. Donaldson was found fatally shot in his home in County Donegal on 4 April 2006, and a murder inquiry was launched. In April 2009, the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> released a statement taking responsibility for the killing.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} the Troubles lessened {{during the early stages}} of the Northern Ireland Peace Process, and {{especially}} following the demilitarisation of the South-Armagh region. The Troubles are widely seen to have ended with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, but not definitively so until the deadly Omagh bombing of August that year, which saw 29 people killed. A minor connection between the area and that tragedy was that one of the two telephone warnings made by the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> with respect to that attack was made from the BT telephone box at McGeough's crossroads in the south of the district, where the Aughanduff Road meets that running from Newry to Crossmaglen.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the Irish {{authorities}} were again party to a settlement, the Good Friday Agreement, which set up power-sharing institutions within Northern Ireland, North-South instructions and {{links between the}} various components of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The Irish state also changed Articles 2 and 3 of the constitution to acknowledge both the existence of Northern Ireland and the desire of Irish nationalists for a united Ireland. Even {{in the wake of}} the post-Good Friday Agreement incorporation of the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin into electoral politics, there remain several republican paramilitary groups who wish to use force to destabilise Northern Ireland – such as the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> and the Continuity IRA. Irish security forces continue to be used to try to prevent attacks by such groups.|$|E
500|$|A large <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> {{explosives}} dump {{and arms}} cache {{were discovered in}} Dunleer, County Louth by Gardaí in October 2010, following a weekend of searches and arrests in {{the east of the}} country. In addition, two <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> men were charged in Dublin's non-jury Special Criminal Court of membership of an illegal organisation. The <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> claimed responsibility for kidnapping and shooting dead of one of their members, Kieran Doherty, for alleged drug dealing. Further significant seizures of <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> arms and explosives were made by the Gardaí during 2012 and 2013, leading to the arrest of over a dozen persons. In 2011 Michael Campbell, brother of Liam, was found guilty in Vilnius, Lithuania, of trying to purchase arms and explosives and was sentenced to twelve years in prison. In October 2013 Campbell was freed on appeal, only to have the Supreme Court of Lithuania order a retrial in June 2014. Campbell has maintained his innocence, accusing British intelligence of attempting to frame him. In June 2013 Gardaí arrested eight people after a <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> meeting and uncovered a massive haul of the plastic explosive Semtex in two raids in Dublin. In October 2013 the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> claimed responsibility for [...] "executing" [...] an alleged leading cocaine dealer in north Belfast.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Real</b> <b>IRA</b> {{has also}} been {{involved}} in vigilantism, mainly against alleged drug dealers and organised crime gangs. In Dublin in particular it {{has been accused of}} extortion and engaging in feuds with these gangs. In July 2012 it was reported that Republican Action Against Drugs (RAAD) and other small republican militant groups were merging with the <b>Real</b> <b>IRA.</b> As before, the group continues to refer to itself as [...] "the Irish Republican Army", but the new group has been referred as the [...] "New IRA" [...] in the press.|$|E
