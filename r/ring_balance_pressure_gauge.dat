40|$|The {{technical}} surface can {{generally be}} defined as the interface of a product and its environment. The coating technology is of great importance for expanding the capacity and improving the performance of a product in many industrial applications. A long-term aim is to adapt complex layer-substrate systems faster and better to predefined functions and stresses and strains in use. This thesis is based on a holistic approach in which the choice of the simulation method, the coating process and the layer-substrate-material-system are interdependent and closely linked with the engineering practice. According to this premise, a basis for the engineering of coating processes via Molecular Dynamics was developed in order to allow the specific construction of layer-substrate-systems. The Molecular Dynamics model of the layer growth consists of interaction potentials for the chosen layer-substrate system copper/silicon(111), dynamic equations for the isotherm-isobar ensemble, mesoscopic observables as well as local pressure and temperature boundary conditions. Central elements of this model are the approximate ab initio potentials for the interaction of the different kinds of particles and the mesoscopic observables. The interaction potentials are derived from the Density Functional Theory and the Tight-Binding-Method. The introduction of mesoscopic observables is necessary in order to interpret the Molecular Dynamics on an engineering scale which allows for a comparison of experimentally measurable process parameters and layer properties. Stress is selected as the major observable of layer growth. This parameter determines mechanical properties such as adhesion, hardness and attrition but also electronic properties like the dislocation of band gaps and the magnetic anisotropy. In addition to the interaction potentials the input parameters of the MD model are the layer forming particle flow, the process pressure and the substrate temperature. These deposition parameters were measured via plasma diagnostics (mass spectrometer and energy analyser), quartz crystal micro <b>balance,</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> and thermo couple. In this thesis the start of the copper nucleation on the silicon substrate is examined. The simulation experiments made with five copper atoms in one box at room temperature (296, 15 K) show that no nucleus is forming in the early deposition process. In fact, the deposited copper atoms diffuse into the silicon substrate. This effect is analyzed with the developed simulation method. To this end, a copper-dimer is artificially put on the silicon surface in the simulation as requirement for a nucleation and compared to two single but neighbouring copper-atoms in the silicon substrate. The results show an energetic advantage of 0, 7 eV for the two single atoms, the copper-dimer is thermodynamically less stable. This effect demands the use of barrier layers on silicon in technical applications. For validating the simulation the deposited copper layers are analyzed regarding their intrinsic stresses, roughness and chemical composition. The results of the intrinsic stress simulation show that the deposition of the first copper atoms {{in the beginning of the}} coating cause tensile stresses of 350 to 640 MPa in the silicon substrate, which was almost stress free before the deposition. In contrast to that the x-ray measuring of real copper layers up to 60 nm yield intrinsic stresses of 80 to 180 MPa. Simulation on lager time scales will give a definite explanation for the great differences of the intrinsic stresses in the borderland of substrate and layer. The quantitative results of the developed MD model allow a characterization of the coating process from the beginning up to the formation of nuclei on the nanometre scale. Thus an MD-based engineering can be pursued for the start phase of coating processes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For {{a case of}} constant-rate liquid {{production}} from a single well centered in a horizontal, homogeneous-acting, isopachous, and infinite reservoir, based on fundamentals of fluid flow in porous media the bottom hole flowing pressure never stabilize. In the process of field well testing, however, pressure values measured by the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> which has a definite resolution value will not change after a period, so the bottom hole flowing pressure can {{be considered to be}} stabilized. According to this situation, through theoretical derivation, a stabilized time formula is firstly proposed, by which the time after which the bottom hole flowing pressure measured with a <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> will be stabilized can be calculated, and the stabilized time for a given <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> is in direct proportion to the liquid producing rate, but in inverse proportion to the resolution ratio of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> Applied the stabilized time formula, a new formula of detectable radius can be derived, by which the effect of resolution of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> can be considered. Secondly, the time after which the value of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> measured in the bottom hole of the observation well starts to change during interference testing is obtained, and the time is related to the fluid flow rate and the distance between the producing well and the observation well. The conclusion can be applied as a reference in the design process of working system during well testing...|$|R
