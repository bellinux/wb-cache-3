40|$|An {{increasing}} number of radio stations nowadays opts for market research on audience shares and music evaluation. Such research can be analysed using general programmes and solutions, such as SPSS and different data warehouse solutions, but there is lack of specialised software that would offer such analysis. The topic of the diploma thesis is Polling Data Analysis, which represents <b>the</b> <b>add-in</b> for Microsoft Excel. <b>The</b> <b>add-in</b> enables <b>the</b> transformation of input, which must be in SPSS file, into more transparent tables and more precise analyses in Excel. It is designed specifically for radio stations, as it allows fast, simple and inexpensive analysis of data, obtained through telephone surveys on the musical taste of the audience. The development of <b>the</b> <b>add-in</b> provides an inexpensive and easy-to-use tool, whose main advantages are {{the fact that it}} is user-friendly and that its operation does not require costly infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|UN/CEFACT’s Modeling Methodology (UMM) is a UML based {{modeling}} {{language and}} has become the method of choice for the modeling of inter-organizational business processes. The complexity of UMM, however, {{makes it difficult to}} use for novice modelers. In order to overcome this limitation and to allow for a seamless integration of UMM into any UML modeling tool of choice, we have developed <b>the</b> UMM <b>Add-In.</b> <b>The</b> UMM <b>Add-In</b> builds upon <b>the</b> UML modeling tool Enterprise Architect [5] and assists a business modeler in creating a valid UMM model. Thereby <b>the</b> <b>Add-In</b> consists of a UMM specific tool bar, a quick link feature, and a UMM validator. Using our UMM Add-In even an inexperienced business modeler can quickly create inter-organizational business process models. 1...|$|R

40|$|This master thesis {{aimed to}} create a syntax support add-in for writing {{business}} rules in Excel. More specifically {{the goal was to}} support business rules written according to the Semantics of Business Rules and Vocabulary standard. <b>The</b> <b>add-in</b> developed aimed to support the writing of the rules by providing syntax highlighting, content assist and validation. The implementation gave rise to many interesting challenges. This was partly because Excel had to be altered in order to function as a syntax support tool, by having dynamic input and feedback. The implementation also included parsing structured natural language. The final phase of the thesis work was to evaluate the end product. The evaluation of the efficiency, usability and correctness of the tool showed that the aim of the thesis was reached. The evaluation also showed that there is potential future work that could further improve <b>the</b> <b>add-in...</b>|$|R
40|$|In recent years, Component {{models have}} become common for desktop and {{server-side}} applications. But {{it has not}} obtained such importance in case of embedded real-time systems.   Therefore, {{there has been a}} lot of research undergoing for introducing such component models for embedded real-time systems.   This thesis work proposes an alternative approach for doing this, by the generation of proxies.    The idea is to provide an extension to an existing binary component and modify it to adapt to the targeted real-time operating system. Rather than modifying the existing component, a new component is generated, which is called as the proxy component.   This newly generated proxy component provides the same method implementation as the original component and also provides some additional services.  These services enable these components to meet the needs of targeted embedded real-time systems.   In order to achieve this, a Visual Studio 2008 add-in has been created. This add-in is capable of inspecting an existing Smart Device Component and visualizes the Classes, Interfaces and Methods in the original component in its UI.   In addition to this, <b>the</b> <b>add-in</b> also shows <b>the</b> available services to be included in the proxy component.   The UI of <b>the</b> <b>add-in</b> is designed in such a way that, the user is able to select the services, which should be included in the proxy component.   Based on the user’s selection, <b>the</b> <b>add-in</b> generates <b>the</b> proxy component with the additional services...|$|R
