5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the <b>reflected</b> <b>wave</b> is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus <b>reflected)</b> <b>wave</b> appears to be standing still on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|E

Numerical computation has been done and conclusion has been drawn from the graphs of amplitudes versus wave number of the <b>reflected</b> Rayleigh <b>waves.</b> The <b>reflected</b> <b>waves</b> depend on the height of the vertical barrier.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the effects of}} local geological structure of the Osaka plain on earthquake ground motions, we observed seismic waves from local earthquakes at a soft soil site (WOS) in the Osaka bay area, a hard ground site (OSA) on diluvium in the Osaka Plain and a rock site (ABU) around {{the northern edge of}} the plain. We observed S <b>waves</b> <b>reflected</b> by the interface between a sedimentary layer and a basement rock at WOS and not at OSA. The <b>reflected</b> <b>waves</b> appear distinctly within 4 to S seconds after S arrivals. Their amplitudes reach about 60 to 80 % of S-wave amplitudes. When the duration of incident S waves on the reflection interface is longer than about 4 seconds, the principal part of S waves at WOS is elongated by the superposition of the <b>reflected</b> <b>waves</b> on the coda part of S waves. When we simulate seismograms as a 2 -D SH problem with a horizontally irregular interface, we can generate the <b>reflected</b> <b>waves</b> at WOS and not so clear at OSA. The amplitudes of the <b>reflected</b> <b>waves</b> simulated are about 50 % of S-wave amplitudes at most. This agrees with the observation for the appearance of the <b>reflected</b> <b>waves.</b> However, the simulation can not explain the large amplitudes of the <b>reflected</b> <b>waves</b> observed. This suggests that the <b>reflected</b> <b>waves</b> are strongly excited by focusing of rays due to the 3 -D irregular structure under WOS...|$|R
25|$|The {{appearance}} of thin films and coatings is {{directly affected by}} interference effects. Antireflective coatings use destructive interference to reduce the reflectivity of the surfaces they coat, {{and can be used}} to minimise glare and unwanted reflections. The simplest case is a single layer with thickness one-fourth the wavelength of incident light. The <b>reflected</b> <b>wave</b> {{from the top of the}} film and the <b>reflected</b> <b>wave</b> from the film/material interface are then exactly 180° out of phase, causing destructive interference. The waves are only exactly out of phase for one wavelength, which would typically be chosen to be near the centre of the visible spectrum, around 550nm. More complex designs using multiple layers can achieve low reflectivity over a broad band, or extremely low reflectivity at a single wavelength.|$|E
25|$|Shielding {{effectiveness}} {{depends on}} the frequency being used. Low-frequency LowFID tags, like those used in implantable devices for humans and pets, are relatively resistant to shielding though thick metal foil will prevent most reads. High frequency HighFID tags (13.56MHz—smart cards and access badges) are sensitive to shielding and are difficult to read when within a few centimetres of a metal surface. UHF Ultra-HighFID tags (pallets and cartons) are difficult to read when placed within a few millimetres of a metal surface, although their read range is actually increased when they are spaced 2–4cm from a metal surface due to positive reinforcement of the <b>reflected</b> <b>wave</b> and the incident wave at the tag.|$|E
25|$|Especially {{due to the}} {{presence}} of the ground, there are some differences in propagation (and also in reflections responsible for TV ghosting) between horizontal and vertical polarizations. AM and FM broadcast radio usually use vertical polarization, while television uses horizontal polarization. At low frequencies especially, horizontal polarization is avoided. That is because the phase of a horizontally polarized wave is reversed upon reflection by the ground. A distant station in the horizontal direction will receive both the direct and <b>reflected</b> <b>wave,</b> which thus tend to cancel each other. This problem is avoided with vertical polarization. Polarization is also important in the transmission of radar pulses and reception of radar reflections by the same or a different antenna. For instance, back scattering of radar pulses by rain drops can be avoided by using circular polarization. Just as specular reflection of circularly polarized light reverses the handedness of the polarization, as discussed above, the same principle applies to scattering by objects much smaller than a wavelength such as rain drops. On the other hand, reflection of that wave by an irregular metal object (such as an airplane) will typically introduce a change in polarization and (partial) reception of the return wave by the same antenna.|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} of plane waves is considered {{in a general}} anisotropic elastic medium {{in the presence of}} initial stress. The Christoffel equations are solved into a polynomial of degree six. The roots of this polynomial represent the vertical slowness values for the six quasi-waves resulting from the presence of a discontinuity in the medium. Three of these six values are identified with the three quasi-waves traveling in the medium but away from its boundary. Reflection at the free plane surface is studied for partition of energy among the three <b>reflected</b> <b>waves.</b> For post-critical incidence, the <b>reflected</b> <b>waves</b> are inhomogeneous (evanescent) waves. Numerical examples are considered to exhibit the effects of initial stress on the phase direction, attenuation and reflection coefficients of the <b>reflected</b> <b>waves.</b> The phase velocities and energy shares of the <b>reflected</b> <b>waves</b> change significantly with initial stress as well as anisotropic symmetry.

25|$|Although now obsolete, CRT {{computer}} displays {{suffered from}} reflection {{by the glass}} envelope, causing glare from room lights and consequently poor contrast. Several anti-reflection solutions were employed to ameliorate this problem. One solution utilized the principle of reflection of circularly polarized light. A circular polarizing filter {{in front of the}} screen allows for the transmission of (say) only right circularly polarized room light. Now, right circularly polarized light (depending on the convention used) has its electric (and magnetic) field direction rotating clockwise while propagating in the +z direction. Upon reflection, the field still has the same direction of rotation, but now propagation is in the −z direction making the <b>reflected</b> <b>wave</b> left circularly polarized. With the right circular polarization filter placed in front of the reflecting glass, the unwanted light reflected from the glass will thus be in very polarization state that is blocked by that filter, eliminating the reflection problem. The reversal of circular polarization on reflection and elimination of reflections in this manner can be easily observed by looking in a mirror while wearing 3-D movie glasses which employ left- and right-handed circular polarization in the two lenses. Closing one eye, the other eye will see a reflection in which it cannot see itself; that lens appears black. However the other lens (of the closed eye) will have the correct circular polarization allowing the closed eye to be easily seen by the open one.|$|E

2500|$|The {{blast wind}} {{at sea level}} may exceed one {{thousand}} km/h, or ~300m/s, approaching {{the speed of sound}} in air. The range for blast effects increases with the explosive yield of the weapon and also depends on the burst altitude. Contrary to what one might expect from geometry, the blast range is not maximal for surface or low altitude blasts but increases with altitude up to an [...] "optimum burst altitude" [...] and then decreases rapidly for higher altitudes. This is due to the nonlinear behaviour of shock waves. When the blast wave from an air burst reaches the ground it is reflected.

2500|$|In the {{important}} special case of reflection {{at normal incidence}} (not involving anisotropic materials) there is no particular s or p polarization. Both the x and y polarization components are reflected identically, and therefore the polarization of the <b>reflected</b> <b>wave</b> is identical {{to that of the}} incident wave. However, in the case of circular (or elliptical) polarization, the handedness of the polarization state is thereby reversed, since by convention this is specified relative to the direction of propagation. The circular rotation of the electric field around the x-y axes called [...] "right-handed" [...] for a wave in the +z direction is [...] "left-handed" [...] for a wave in the -z direction. But in the general case of reflection at a nonzero angle of incidence, no such generalization can be made. For instance, right-circularly polarized light reflected from a dielectric surface at a grazing angle, will still be right-handed (but elliptically) polarized. Linear polarized light reflected from a metal at non-normal incidence will generally become elliptically polarized. These cases are handled using Jones vectors acted upon by the different Fresnel coefficients for the s and p polarization components.|$|E

2500|$|In the era {{the advice}} was {{originally}} given, {{the most common}} nuclear weapons were weapons comparable to the US Fat Man and Soviet Joe-1 in yield. The most far-reaching dangers that initially come from the nuclear explosion of this, and higher, yield weapons as airbursts, are the initial flash/heat and blast effects and not from fallout. This {{is due to the}} fact that when nuclear weapons are detonated to maximize the range of building destruction, that is, maximize the range of surface blast damage, an airburst is the preferred nuclear fuzing height, as it exploits the mach stem phenomenon. This phenomenon of a blast wave occurs when the blast reaches the ground and is reflected. Below a certain reflection angle the <b>reflected</b> <b>wave</b> and the incident wave merge and form a reinforced horizontal wave, this is known as the 'Mach stem' (named after Ernst Mach) and is a form of constructive interference and consequently extends the range of high pressure. While Air-burst fuzing also increases the range that peoples skin will have a line-of-sight with the nuclear fireball. However, as a result of the high altitude of the explosion, most of the radioactive bomb debris/ is dispersed into the stratosphere, with a great column of air therefore placed between the vast majority of the bomb debris/fission reaction products and people on the ground for a number of crucial days before it falls out of the atmosphere in a comparatively dilute fashion, this [...] "delayed fallout" [...] is henceforth not an immediate concern to those near the blast. On the other hand, the only time that fallout is rapidly concentrated in a potentially lethal fashion in the local/regional area around the explosion is when the nuclear fireball makes contact with the ground surface, with an explosion that does so, being aptly termed a surface burst. For example, in the Operation Crossroads tests of 1946 on Bikini Atoll, using two explosive devices of the same design and yield, the first, Test Able (an air burst) had little local fallout, but the infamous Test Baker a near surface shallow (underwater burst) left the local test targets badly contaminated with radioactive fallout.|$|E
