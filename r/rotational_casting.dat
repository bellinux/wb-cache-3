40|$|A {{family of}} fluoroaluminate glasses has been {{identified}} as the ideal host for doping with Nd 3 + for use in the development of lasers and amplifiers in the second telecom window. For optimum performance, a fibre with high numerical aperture (NA), fibre length of 5 cm and loss of 10 dB/m is required. The high NA implies a core diameter of 3 µm is needed and thus the core-to-clad interface represents greater than 50 % of the core area. Crystallisation in the interface introduces large scattering losses. The critical step in the fabrication process is preform fabrication. We will present results comparing the different techniques employed and thermal and mechanical fabrication process modelling consistent with our experimental observations and detail the advantages and limiting parameters for the different processes. Rod-in-tube is the simplest technique of preform fabrication and works exceptionally well for oxide glasses. Fluorides are highly prone to surface crystallisation. We have looked at the fibre losses as functions of polishing material, polishing time, and etching. It is a good first step to test the optical properties and performance in a fibre. <b>Rotational</b> <b>casting</b> is usually employed in fluoride glasses.

40|$|The {{internal}} {{carotid artery}} in the horse is of significant veterinary importance due to its intimate relationship with the guttural pouch, and mycotic disease thereof. The relevance of recognising and identifying variations involving the {{internal carotid artery}} {{lies in the fact}} that surgical occlusion of the artery is the treatment of choice for guttural pouch mycosis. However, occlusion could be hampered when there is doubt about the anatomy of this vessel and its variation. Conventional angiography and automatic rotational angiographic techniques were used to study the anatomy of the carotid trifurcation and the internal carotid artery on cadavers of three species included in the genus Equus; 50 horses, 26 donkeys and one zebra. Following angiography, arterial latex casting was performed on the horse and donkey specimens with subsequent dissection to harvest the hardened arterial <b>casts.</b> <b>Rotational</b> angiography with 3 -dimensional image reconstruction represent a major advantage in the angiographic diagnosis of carotid and cerebral vascular variation compared to conventional angiography. This technique generated superior angiographic images of the carotid and cerebral vascular system of horses, donkey and zebra. In the horse, five variations of the internal carotid artery were identified as follows: [1] the internal carotid artery and occipital artery arising as a common trunk, [2] an aberrant branch of the internal carotid artery that unites with the basilar artery, [3] an aberrant branch of the internal carotid artery that does not unite with the basilar artery, [4] aberrant branch of the internal carotid artery that gives rise to several satellite branches, [5] aberrant branch of the internal carotid artery that has a satellite branch connected to the caudal branch of the ipsilateral occipital artery. Variations of the carotid arterial tree in donkeys were identified as follow: [1] the internal carotid and occipital arteries shared a common trunk, [2] the linguofacial trunk originated from the common carotid artery causing the common carotid artery to terminate as four branches, [3] a short external carotid artery before giving rise to the linguofacial trunk, mimicking the appearance of the common carotid artery terminating into four branches, [4] the internal carotid artery originating far more caudal from the common carotid artery termination.

40|$|Traditional {{sand casting}} {{is a well}} {{understood}} method to produce metal shapes and {{has been used for}} many years in industry. It is a relatively simple method but has a significant drawback, with the requirement of a pattern to form the internal cavity. Patterns are produced at high cost through Computer Numerical Controlled machining or wood pattern making with significantly high lead times. Rapid Prototyping is seen as a solution to this problem, with the ability to produce sand moulds directly from Computer Aided Design platforms and thus eliminate the requirement of a pattern. Through layered manufacturing, the sand mould can be produced with complex internal geometry directly, minimising labour costs and involving short waiting times. While initial research was mainly concerned with the use of Selective Laser Sintering, with the advent of 3 D printing, pattern-less sand moulds can be produced more easily and cheaply. With the process gaining more and more popularity, there was a need to scientifically assess the suitability of the process for sand casting as well as, establish influences of typical process parameters on significant responses. Critical mould properties, such as permeability and compressive strength, were investigated with respect to varying time and temperature of baking. To this end, mathematical models of permeability and compressive strength were developed. Also, the influence of mould material, mould coating, alloy type and pouring temperatures were investigated in static sand casting of light metals. Further work utilised the centrifugal casting process using these 3 D printed moulds to establish links between process factors, such as <b>rotational</b> speed and <b>cast</b> strength using light metals. Compressive strength results for the rapidly produced materials were acceptable compared to traditional values. Permeability was however lower than commonly used foundry sand. Results showed, nevertheless, that permeability and compressive strength were both improved by baking times and temperatures. Significant model effects were established for ZP 131 and ZCast 501 with respect to increased compressive strength and mould permeability. Multi-factorial experiments involving simultaneous variation of factors such as mould materials, surface coatings, alloys and pouring temperatures were conducted and static casting results in general show good as-cast mechanical properties with the factors having significant effects on surface roughness, percent elongation and hardness. Centrifugal casting of aluminium alloys initially produced below average tensile properties, due to the large presence of hydrogen porosity. However, upon degassing, much improved tensile strengths were obtained, being superior to both static casting and traditionally sand cast aluminium. Also a Magnesium alloy was successfully trialled with the centrifugal process using 3 D printed moulds in spite of numerous practical difficulties. Substantial data relating to the process factors for mould materials and casting processes was produced. Analysis of factor influences facilitated optimum process configurations for the production of moulds and castings. These combinations of factors at optimum levels comprehensively showed that light metals such as aluminium and magnesium alloys could be successfully processed by rapidly produced moulds, both statically and centrifugally...|$|R
40|$|Soft glass {{optical fibers}} are of great {{interest}} for the scientific community, since {{they can be used}} for compact short pulsed optical fiber lasers operating in the near infrared wavelength region. Indeed soft glasses such as phosphate and tellurite can incorporate large amounts of rare earth ions while keeping a high absorption and emission cross sections, without clustering effects. This research work aimed at developing rare earth doped phosphate glass optical fibers doped with Yb 3 + and Er 3 + ions suitable for short pulsed fiber lasers. The phosphate glasses were prepared by melt quenching technique in a controlled atmosphere furnace at temperature above 1300 °C and then cast on brass molds. The glasses were thermally characterized by differential scanning calorimetry in order to measure the characteristic temperatures. Optical characterization was carried out to measure the refractive index of the prepared glasses. The characteristic temperatures (glass transition temperature and crystallization temperature) and the refractive index of the fabricated glasses are reported in Table I. The core glass was doped with Er 3 + and Yb 3 + ions (2. 5 x 1026 ions/m 3) of and the calculated numerical aperture (NA) between core and 1 st cladding was 0. 11, while between 1 st and 2 nd cladding was equal to 0. 36. An optical fiber could then be fabricated by the prepared glasses by preform drawing. The preforms were fabricated by rod-in-tube technique with the tubes manufactured using the <b>rotational</b> <b>casting</b> technique.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{continuous}} and natural motion, fluidic elastomer actuators (FEAs) have shown potential {{in a range}} of robotic applications including prosthetics and orthotics. Despite their advantages and rapid developments, robots using these actuators still have several challenging issues to be addressed. First, the reliable production of low cost and complex actuators that can apply high forces is necessary, yet none of existing fabrication methods are both easy to implement and of high force output. Next, compliant or stretchable sensors that can be embedded into their bodies for sophisticated functions are required, however, many of these sensors suffer from hysteresis, fabrication complexity, chemical safety and environmental instability, and material incompatibility with soft actuators. Finally, feedback control for FEAs is necessary to achieve better performance, but most soft robots are still “open-loop”. In this dissertation, I intend to help solve the above issues and drive the applications of soft robotics towards hand orthotics and prosthetics. First, I adapt <b>rotational</b> <b>casting</b> as a new manufacturing method for soft actuators. I present a cuboid soft actuator that can generate a force of > 25 N at its tip, a near ten-fold increase over similar actuators previously reported. Next, I propose a soft orthotic finger with position control enabled via embedded optical fiber. I monitor both the static and dynamic states via the optical sensor and achieve the prescribed curvatures accurately and with stability by a gain-scheduled proportional-integral-derivative controller. Then I develop the soft orthotic fingers into a low-cost, closed-loop controlled, soft orthotic glove that can be worn by a typical human hand and helpful for grasping light objects, while also providing finger position control. I achieve motion control with inexpensive, binary pneumatic switches controlled by a simple finite-state-machine. Finally, I report the first use of stretchable optical waveguides for strain sensing in a soft prosthetic hand. These optoelectronic strain sensors are easy to fabricate, chemically inert, and demonstrate low hysteresis and high precision in their output signals. I use the optoelectronically innervated prosthetic hand to conduct various active sensation experiments inspired by the capabilities of a real hand...|$|E

In fact, they can be doped with large amounts of rare earth (RE) ions (up to 1021 ions/cm 3) without clustering, therefore enabling the realization of compact active devices with high gain per unit length. Moreover, phosphate glasses possess a large glass forming range, good thermo-mechanical and chemical properties, low nonlinear refractive index and no evidence of photodarkening even at high population inversion. The aim {{of this research was}} the realization of different configurations of Nd 3 +-doped phosphate glass waveguides, in particular a double cladding (DC) optical fibre and circular and D-shaped cladding rods, to be used in lasers and optical amplifiers, in a CW or pulsed regime. Three different phosphate glass compositions (for the core, inner cladding and outer cladding) were designed in order to obtain an adequate numerical aperture between different elements while maintaining similar thermo-mechanical properties in view of the drawing process. The glasses were prepared by conventional melt-quenching technique in a controlled atmosphere furnace at 1400 °C and then cast on pre-heated brass molds. Physical, thermal and spectroscopic properties of the manufactured glasses were measured. The waveguides realized for this research were manufactured by preform drawing with the preforms being obtained by rod-in-tube technique. The fabrication of each preform required one rod of core glass fabricated by melt quenching and one or two tubes shaped by <b>rotational</b> <b>casting,</b> using an in-house built equipment.
