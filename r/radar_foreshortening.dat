40|$|Distortions {{inherent}} on {{synthetic aperture}} radio (SAR) imagery {{and the development}} to date of unsupervised postprocessing rectification techniques are described. The geometric distortion {{can be divided into}} two categories: (1) distortion derived from the radar viewing geometry, this includes such effects as ground range nonlinearities, <b>radar</b> <b>foreshortening</b> and radar layover; (2) distortion introduced during the data processing, these distortions result from approximations made during the correlation such as in estimation of the target phase history, or compensation for the earth rotation. The processor induced distortions depends on the specific correlation algorithm used for image formation. The effects are addressed on the image product resulting from assumptions during the processing and it specifically considers distortions inherent in digital imagery produced by the digital image processor...|$|E
30|$|Most {{valuable}} for interpretation purposes of fine-scaled structures is the ALOS PALSAR- 2 radar image taken in Ultra-Fine mode with {{a resolution of}} 3  m/px (Fig.  4). Due to considerable noise it was filtered and resampled to 10  m. It provides the backscatter amplitude in HH polarization and is therefore similar to the data presented in Fig.  2 a–d (red component). The potential to map the structural and depositional inventory (faults, folds, layering along with thicknesses), {{as well as the}} potential to easily differentiate between consolidated and unconsolidated material in the near (sub-) surface, remains identical (Fig.  5). However, the high-resolution image poses some challenges, in particular in convoluted areas near the inner ring where strata are more chaotically arranged and postimpact fluvial erosion overprints the original settings [see streamlined island (sb) in Fig.  4 b]. The returned radar backscatter is composed of surface and near-subsurface reflectance. As shown in Fig.  4 c, d, the exposed inner ring shows distinct layering (Fig.  4 c), whereas the northern inselbergs (Fig.  4 d) appear not layered at this image scale. The layering attitude, however, cannot be quantified due to <b>radar</b> <b>foreshortening</b> effects, but it is considered relatively steep in the inner ring structure. In Fig.  4 d, the contact between impact-deformed bedrock with potential folding and undisturbed units of different origin just to the north is exposed, which potentially helps to delineate the impact structure as it is observed today. Using these boundaries, we estimate a diameter of 15.6  ±  0.3  km depending on the location of measurement profile as the overall shape of the outermost ring is slightly asymmetric, which could be caused by erosional effects rather than being due to a specific angle of impact.|$|E
40|$|After a {{preliminary}} assessment of venusian channels, {{it now seems}} to be clear that the channels have distinctive classes, which imply a wide range of formation parameters and formation mechanisms. They include outflow channels mainly formed by mechanical erosion from very high discharge flow, and canali-type channels requiring either constructional process or mechanical erosion by rather exotic low-viscosity lava such as carbonatite or sulfur. Here we focus on venusian sinuous rilles. Venusian sinuous rilles are generally simple, and originate from a collapsed source. They are shallow and narrow downstream. The venusian sinuous rilles are distinct from canali-type channels, which exhibit almost constant morphologies throughout their entire length, and from outflow channels, which are characterized by wide anastomosing reaches. The lunar sinuous rilles could have been formed initially as constructional channels. However, incision was caused by the long flow duration and high temperatures of eruption, along with relatively large discharge rates, possibly assisted by a low viscosity of the channel-forming lava. Channel narrowing and levee formation suggest relatively fast cooling. The venusian channels could have had a similar sequence of formation including rapid cooling. Assuming the substrate is typical tholeiitic lava, the flowing lavas' temperatures have to be higher than the melting temperature of the substrate. The flow should have a low viscosity to cause turbulence and keep a high Reynolds number to sustain efficient thermal erosion. Determining eruption conditions also provide insights to estimate lava composition. Assuming a channel is formed mostly by thermal erosion, the channel's length and longitudinal profile are functions of lava properties. The depth profiles of the channel are measured by <b>radar</b> <b>foreshortening</b> methods and stereo images. Eruption conditions of channel forming lava can be estimated by the methods developed by Hulme...|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} image of the pole's top will overlay that of some terrain point which is on the same slant range arc but at a shorter {{horizontal}} range ("ground-range"). Images of scene surfaces which faced both the illumination and the apparent eyepoint will have geometries that resemble those of an optical scene viewed from that eyepoint. However, slopes facing the <b>radar</b> will be <b>foreshortened</b> and ones facing away from it will be lengthened from their horizontal (map) dimensions. The former will therefore be brightened and the latter dimmed.|$|R
40|$|This work {{assesses the}} {{feasibility}} of national ground deformation monitoring of Great Britain using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery acquired by Copernicus’ Sentinel- 1 constellation and interferometric SAR (InSAR) analyses. As of December 2016, the assessment reveals that, since May 2015, more than 250 interferometric wide (IW) swath products have been acquired on average every month by the constellation at regular revisit cycles for the entirety of Great Britain. A simulation of <b>radar</b> distortions (layover, <b>foreshortening,</b> and shadow) confirms that topographic constraints have a limited effect on SAR visibility of the landmass and, despite the predominance of rural land cover types, there is potential for over 22, 000, 000 intermittent small baseline subset (ISBAS) monitoring targets for each acquisition geometry (ascending and descending) using a set of IW image frames covering the entire landmass. Finally, InSAR results derived through ISBAS processing of the Doncaster area with an increasing amount of Sentinel- 1 IW scenes reveal a consistent decrease of standard deviation of InSAR velocities from 6 mm/year to ≤ 2 mm/year. Such results can be integrated with geological and geohazard susceptibility data and provide key information to inform the government, other institutions and the public on {{the stability of the}} landmas...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{differential}} radar interferometry (D- InSAR) {{has proven to}} be a powerful remote sensing technique to detect and measure deformation of the Earth’s crust, such as landslides, with an accuracy of a few millimeters. However, as a consequence of the inclined imaging geometry, areas with a topographic relief (where landslides usually occur) appear heavily distorted in the radar image. Thereby slopes inclined towards the <b>radar</b> appear shortened (<b>foreshortening)</b> and in extreme even can cause an overlapping of different radar signals (layover effect); slopes oriented away from the radar seem stretched (elongation) or even can be shadowed by a steep mountain (shadowing). These effects limit or even prohibit the use of a radar image for interferometric applications. Besides these geometric distortions, the land cover has great influence on the applicability of differential radar interferometry. For example vegetation-free areas such as buildings, roads and rocks show a high stability in their backscattering properties, whereas areas covered by vegetation, especially forests, have varying backscattering properties at different times (e. g. due to wind). Areas with a high constancy of their backscattering properties are better suited for the D-InSAR-technique. To date prior to an investigation using D-InSAR these limiting effects usually are only estimated, sometimes leading to disappointing results when the actual radar images are analyzed. Therefore in the present work a GIS routine was developed, which based on freely available DEM data (SRTM) not only accurately predicts the areas in which layover and shadowing will occur, but also determines the measurable percentage of the movement (portion oriented in radar line of sight) for a given radar acquisition geometry. Additionally land cover classification data (CORINE) is used to assess the influence of the land cover to D-InSAR deformation measurements. Thus by using this new GIS application, in future it is possible to evaluate the usability of D-InSAR landslide deformation measurements in a certain region quite accurately before the expensive actual radar records are ordered...|$|R
