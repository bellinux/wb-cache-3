40|$|International audienceWe have {{evaluated}} {{the accuracy of}} the Bethe-Salpeter singlet–triplet transition energies as well as singlet–triplet and triplet–triplet splittings for 20 organic molecules, using as <b>reference</b> the <b>CC</b> 3 values determined by Thiel and co-workers with both the TZVP and aug-cc-pVTZ atomic basis sets. Our excitation energies are obtained on the basis of GW quasiparticle energy levels that are self-consistently converged with respect to the starting DFT eigenvalues. In its current form, BSE/GW is often unable to provide a balanced description of both singlet and triplet excited-states. While the singlet–singlet and triplet–triplet energy separations are obtained accurately, triplets are located too close in energy from the ground-state, by typically − 0. 55 eV when using standard functionals to generate the starting eigenstates. Applying the Tamm-Dancoff approximation upshifts the BSE triplet energies and allows reducing this error to ca. − 0. 40 eV, while using M 06 -HF eigenstates allows a further increase and hence a reduction of the error for triplet states, but at the cost of larger errors for the singlet excited-states. At this stage, the most accurate TD-DFT estimates therefore remain competitive for computing singlet–triplet transition energies. Indeed, with M 06 - 2 X, irrespective of the application or not of the Tamm-Dancoff approximation and of the selected atomic basis set, the deviations obtained with TD-DFT are rather small...|$|R

We genotyped 758 unselected patients with colorectal cancer and 1, 841 healthy adults. We found that a significantly decreased risk of colorectal cancer was associated with XPC polymorphism rs 2228000 _CT genotype (OR 0. 59; p< 0. 0001) and the rs 2228000 _TT genotype (OR 0. 29; p< 0. 0001) compared to the <b>reference</b> genotype (<b>CC).</b> And an increased disease risk was associated with the XPD SNP, rs 1799793 _AG genotype (OR 1. 44, p = 0. 018) and rs 1799793 _AA genotype (OR 3. 31, p< 0. 0001) compared to the reference genotype.

The bCC representation generates a non-hermitian secular matrix, the eigenvalues representing excitation energies, while the corresponding spectral intensities are to be derived from both the left and right eigenvectors. Using the perspective of the bCC representation, a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the excited-state CC methods is given, extending and generalizing previous such studies. Here, the essential topics are the truncation error characteristics and the separability properties, the latter being crucial for designing size-consistent approximation schemes. Based on the general order relations for the bCC secular matrix and the (left and right) eigenvector matrices, formulas for the perturbation-theoretical (PT) order of the truncation errors (TEO) are derived for energies, transition moments, and property matrix elements of arbitrary excitation classes and truncation levels. In the analysis of the separability properties of the transition moments, the decisive role of the so-called dual ground state is revealed. Due to the use of CE states the bCC approach can be compared to so-called intermediate state representation (ISR) methods based exclusively on suitably orthonormalized CE states. As the present analysis shows, the bCC approach has decisive advantages over the conventional CI treatment, but also distinctly weaker TEO and separability properties in comparison with a full (and hermitian) ISR method...|$|R
40|$|While {{simulations}} of the measured biodynamic {{responses of the}} whole human body or body segments to vibration are conventionally interpreted as summaries of biodynamic measurements, and the resulting models are considered quantitative, this study looked at these simulations from a different angle: model calibration. The specific aims {{of this study are}} to review and clarify the theoretical basis for model calibration, to help formulate the criteria for calibration validation, and to help appropriately select and apply calibration methods. In addition to established vibration theory, a novel theorem of mechanical vibration is also used to enhance the understanding of the mathematical and physical principles of the calibration. Based on this enhanced understanding, a set of criteria was proposed and used to systematically examine the calibration methods. Besides theoretical analyses, a numerical testing method is also used in the examination. This study identified the basic requirements for each calibration method to obtain a unique calibration solution. This study also confirmed that the solution becomes more robust if more than sufficient calibration references are provided. Practically, however, as more references are used, more inconsistencies can arise among the measured data for representing the biodynamic properties. To help account for the relative reliabilities of the references, a baseline weighting scheme is proposed. The analyses suggest that the best choice of calibration method depends on the modeling purpose, the model structure, and the availability and reliability of representative <b>reference</b> data. <b>CC</b> 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2016 - 01 - 04 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 26740726 PMC 469932...|$|R

Water samples were taken along a vertical profile during the winter (August 2009) and summer (February 2010) and in the surface sediments (2 cm) during the winter. Physical and chemical characteristics of water and sediments were evaluated. Lamparelli's Trophic State Index (TSI) was calculated; RESULTS: limnological variability was mostly affected by the season. The spatial heterogeneity of the Complex was more pronounced during winter, with greater differences among its compartments. Nitrogen was higher in the winter, whereas in the summer there was a substantial phosphorus increase along with a nitrogen decrease. The most degraded compartments, associated with the highest nutrient levels, were CB and TQ. In contrast, the upstream region of the RP branch was considered a reference site (the least impacted) for the Complex; CONCLUSION: The Billings Complex ranged from mesotrophic (RP) or eutrophic (RG) to super-eutrophic (<b>CC,</b> TQ). High <b>TSI</b> variation also occurred within compartments and/or depending on the season, mainly associated with the human management of the Complex. The surface sediments underlined the differences observed between the extremes in the Billings Complex water quality, {{as well as providing}} additional information on other impacts that was not observed from the water analysis.

Parental questionnaires covering residential history were linked to oral examinations of 19, 885 6 - to 15 -year-old Australian children conducted in 1992 by the School Dental Services of South Australia and Queensland. The percentage of lifetime exposed to optimally fluoridated water at CC, maturation (MAT) and post-eruption (POST) was calculated. Combined exposure variables describing different levels of CC, maturation and post-eruption were created using a threshold exposure of 50 %. Compared to the <b>reference</b> of <b>CC</b> or = 50 %/MAT or = 50 % [rate ratio (RR) 0. 52], CC > or = 50 %/MAT > or = 50 %/POST or = 50 %/MAT > or = 50 %/POST > or = 50 % (RR 0. 67) had the strongest caries-preventive effect, followed by CC > or = 50 %/MAT or = 50 %/POST > or = 50 % (RR = 0. 81) in negative binomial regression models (p or = 50 %/POST or = 50 % (RR = 0. 84) had weaker, non-significant caries-preventive effects. In conclusion a high exposure at CC was important for caries prevention irrespective of the effect of exposure at maturation and post-eruption. The strongest caries-preventive effect was produced by a high exposure at CC supplemented by a high exposure at maturation and/or post-eruption, but the latter two phases could not produce a significant caries-preventive effect on their own.

Additionally, an increased in vitro production of IL- 1 b by monocytes and an increased serum expression of the cytokine correlated with the severity of the disease, since it was significantly higher in DCL patients heavily infected with Leishmania mexicana. The distribution of IL- 1 b in lesions also varied according to the number of parasites harbored in the tissues: in heavily infected LCL patients and in all DCL patients, the cytokine was scattered diffusely throughout the lesion. In contrast, in LCL patients with lower numbers of parasites in the lesions, IL- 1 b was confined to the cells.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to test the association between genetic markers and the response to biologics in psoriasis (etanercept, adalimumab, ustekinumab) in a prospective cohort. METHODS: We investigated the copy number variation in the LCE 3 B and LCE 3 C genes, and eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HLA-C* 06, CD 84, IL 12 B, IL 23 R, TRAF 3 IP 2, ERAP 1, IFIH 1 and TNFAIP 3. The decrease in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) was calculated as PASI (absolute PASI decrease compared with baseline) and PASI 75 (proportion of patients with >/= 75 % improvement vs. baseline). Associations between genetic variants and treatment outcome were assessed using multivariable linear regression analysis (PASI corrected for baseline PASI, primary analysis) and Pearson's chi 2 -test or Fisher's exact test (PASI 75, secondary analysis). RESULTS: We included 348 treatment episodes in 234 patients. Patients heterozygous (GA) for the SNP in CD 84 (rs 6427528) had a better PASI response to etanercept after 3 months (P = 0. 025) than the homozygous reference group (GG). In addition, patients heterozygous (CT) for the IL 12 B variant showed a better response (PASI) to ustekinumab (P = 0. 017) than the <b>reference</b> group (<b>CC).</b> Patients homozygous (GG) for the SNP in TNFAIP 3 showed a worse response (PASI) to ustekinumab (P = 0. 031) than the reference group (TT).

As TSCs e os DTCs foram avaliados quanto a suas atividades anti-T. cruzi e citotoxicidade frente a células de macrófagos J 774, sendo possível avaliar as influências dos grupos periféricos substituintes. Nestes estudos, dois novos compostos, além do H 2 bdtc, cuja atividade é conhecida, se mostraram promissores, H 2 bt e H 2 bmt, apresentando valores de atividade tripanocida CC 50 try = 9, 91 e 6, 85 µM, respectivamente, para a cepa Y na forma tripomastigota do T. cruzi. Ambos foram superiores ao benzonidazol, utilizado como referência (CC 50 try = 10, 6 µM). Os compostos também se mostraram seletivos, com CC 50 > 100 µM para células de macrófago J 774. Estudos de complexação com GaIII utilizando H 2 bdtc como agente complexante levaram a dois novos complexos, variando-se as condições reacionais, sendo um mononuclear, [Ga(bdtc) (Hbdtc) ].

40|$|Smoking {{remains the}} leading cause of {{preventable}} death in the United States. There are numerous harmful substances in tobacco and tobacco smoke. Among the more than 4, 000 identified compounds in smoke, many metals contribute to the health risks associated with tobacco use. Specific metals found in tobacco and tobacco smoke have been classified as carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Exposure to toxic metals can cause outcomes including inflammation, sensitization and carcinogenesis. Metals in tobacco are transported in tobacco smoke proportionally with their concentrations in tobacco filler for a given cigarette design. To quantitatively examine the metal content in numerous tobacco products, high throughput methods are desired. This study developed a simple, rapid tobacco digestion method coupled with a sensitive analytical method using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Because of known memory effects and volatility of mercury, quantitative determinations of mercury were made with a direct combustion analyzer. The methods were utilized to examine arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, mercury and nickel contents in cigarette tobacco and to establish a reference range for the metals in 50 varieties of cigarettes available in the US. These results are comparable to the limited data sets reported by others and with available standard <b>reference</b> material values. <b>CC</b> 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2015 - 08 - 24 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 23548667 PMC 454735...|$|R
40|$|Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are {{a family}} of endogenous, small, noncoding {{single-stranded}} RNAs that act as post-transcriptional gene regulatory elements. MiRNA polymorphisms {{may be associated with}} susceptibility to congenital heart disease (CHD). The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of miRNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on CHD susceptibility. Methods: We genotyped two functional SNPs, miR- 196 a 2 rs 11614913 and miR- 146 a rs 2910164, in a case-control cohort of 173 Chinese patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and 207 non-CHD controls. Results: When the miR- 196 a 2 rs 11614913 TT homozygote genotype was used as the reference group, the TC genotype was not associated with an increased risk of TOF. The CC genotype was associated with a borderline significantly increased risk for TOF. In the recessive model, when the miR- 196 a 2 rs 11614913 TT/TC genotypes were used as the <b>reference</b> group, the <b>CC</b> homozygote genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of TOF (OR = 1. 96, 95 % CI = 1. 18 - 3. 25, p = 0. 01). The miR- 146 a rs 2910164 C>G polymorphism was not associated with developing TOF. Conclusions: Our findings suggested that the miR- 196 a 2 rs 11614913 T>C polymorphism may play a role in the development of TOF.

30|$|Telomeres are {{repetitive}} nucleotide sequences that cap {{the end of}} eukaryotic chromosomes. Attrition {{of these}} structures {{has been associated with}} carcinogenesis in many tissues, and therefore, they are essential for chromosome stabilization. Telomeres are maintained by telomerase complexes, of which human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is an essential component. A functional polymorphism, - 1327 C>T (rs 2735940), located in the promoter of the hTERT gene is associated with telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes. We hypothesized that this polymorphism might affect susceptibility to various epithelial malignancies. The - 1327 C>T polymorphism was examined in 1, 551 consecutive autopsy cases (mean age, 80.3  years), and we focused on its effect on the risks of overall and each primary malignancies. The polymorphism was further studied in 391 clinical prostate cancer patients who were diagnosed via prostate biopsy, using autopsy cases as controls. In the autopsy cases, the risk of epithelial malignancy, after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and drinking habits, was significantly lower for the TT genotype than the <b>CC</b> (<b>reference)</b> genotype (adjusted odds ratio[*]=[*] 0.61, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0.42 - 0.90). Among primary malignancies, latent prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer were the most strongly associated with the polymorphism. In the study using clinical prostate cancer patients, susceptibility to clinical prostate cancer was lower for - 1327  T carriers than for - 1327  T non-carriers, but this finding was not significant. The data suggest that the hTERT promoter polymorphism, - 1327 C>T, is an independent factor influencing the risk of various epithelial malignancies in elderly Japanese.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical <b>references.</b> Cloud Computing (<b>CC)</b> is {{becoming}} popular among organisations from different industries in South Africa (SA) {{because of its}} promises such as cost reduction, on demand self-service, broad access network, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, measured service, little or no set up capital and faster time to market. As a result, many organisations {{are already in the}} early stages of their CC implementation while others are planning to adopt CC. Although CC promises many benefits, it is equally important to note that there are some barriers to its adoption which needs to be considered before adoption in order to ensure implementation success. Proper understanding of these barriers and coming up with ways to mitigate them will improve the CC readiness level of organisations. Among the various industry sectors, the financial industry in SA has been one of the early adopters of CC but they have not fully implemented it because of barriers such as security and privacy (Vignos, Kim, & Metzer, 2013), governance issues, inadequate cloud service level agreements (SLAs), vendor lock in, poor vendor transparency, inability to assess risks, confidentiality, integrity and availability. Because CC is relatively new and is still in its early stages, not much work has been done to inform organisations about the barriers and enablers of CC. Available guidelines to help organisations improve their CC readiness level are also inadequate. This is risky for financial institutions that deal with sensitive customer information as the safety of that information is not guaranteed if a desired readiness level is not attained before implementation...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} Learning Object (LO) {{is crucial for}} the {{standardization}} on eLearning. The latest LO standard from IMS Global Learning Consortium is the IMS Common Cartridge (IMS CC) that organizes and distributes digital learning content. By analyzing this new specification we considered two interoperability levels: content and communication. A common content format is the backbone of interoperability and {{is the basis for}} content exchange among eLearning systems. Communication is more than just exchanging content; it includes also accessing to specialized systems and services and reporting on content usage. This is particularly important when LOs are used for evaluation. In this paper we analyze the Common Cartridge profile based on the two interoperability levels we proposed. We detail its data model that comprises a set of derived schemata <b>referenced</b> on the <b>CC</b> schema and we explore the use of the IMS Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) to allow remote tools and content to be integrated into a Learning Management System (LMS). In order to test the applicability of IMS CC for automatic evaluation we define a representation of programming exercises using this standard. This representation is intended to be the cornerstone of a network of eLearning systems where students can solve computer programming exercises and obtain feedback automatically. The CC learning object is automatically generated based on a XML dialect called PExIL that aims to consolidate all the data need to describe resources within the programming exercise life-cycle. Finally, we test the generated cartridge on the IMS CC online validator to verify its conformance with the IMS CC specification...|$|R
40|$|Left main {{coronary}} artery disease (LMCAD) is a particular severe phenotype of {{coronary artery}} disease (CAD) and heritability. Interleukin (IL) may play important roles in the pathogenesis of CAD. Although several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in IL related genes have been evaluated for their roles in inflammatory diseases and CAD predisposition, the investigations between genetic variants and CAD phenotype are limited. We hypothesized {{that some of these}} gene SNPs may contribute to LMCAD phenotype susceptibility compared with more peripheral {{coronary artery disease}} (MPCAD). In a hospital-based case-only study, we studied IL- 1 A rs 1800587 C/T, IL- 1 B rs 16944 G/A, IL- 6 rs 1800796 C/G, IL- 6 R rs 7529229 T/C, IL- 8 rs 4073 T/A, IL- 10 rs 1800872 A/C, and IL- 10 rs 1800896 A/G SNPs in 402 LMCAD patients and 804 MPCAD patients in a Chinese population. Genotyping was done using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and ligation detection reaction (LDR) method. When the IL- 6 R rs 7529229 TT homozygote genotype was used as the <b>reference</b> group, the <b>CC</b> or TC/CC genotypes were associated with the increased risk for LMCAD (CC vs. TT, adjusted odds ratio(OR) = 1. 46, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 02 – 2. 11, p = 0. 042; CC + TC vs. TT, adjusted OR = 1. 31, 95 % CI = 1. 02 – 1. 69, p = 0. 037). None of the other six SNPs achieved any significant differences between LMCAD and MPCAD. The present study suggests that IL- 6 R rs 7529229 T/C functional SNP may contribute to the risk of LMCAD in a Chinese population. However, our results were limited.

40|$|AIM: The study {{aimed at}} (a) {{contributing}} to a spatial evaluation of the Billings Complex water quality; (b) associating information on the geochemistry of the surface sediments; and (c) providing, based on previous studies, a temporal evaluation of the Complex's water quality since the Pinheiros River pumping restriction; METHODS: sampling was performed at 12 sites: 2 in the Central body (CB), 3 in the Taquacetuba branch (TQ), 3 in the Rio Pequeno branch (RP) and 4 in the Rio Grande Reservoir (RG). Water samples were taken along a vertical profile during the winter (August 2009) and summer (February 2010) and in the surface sediments (2 cm) during the winter. Physical and chemical characteristics of water and sediments were evaluated. Lamparelli's Trophic State Index (TSI) was calculated; RESULTS: limnological variability was mostly affected by the season. The spatial heterogeneity of the Complex was more pronounced during winter, with greater differences among its compartments. Nitrogen was higher in the winter, whereas in the summer there was a substantial phosphorus increase along with a nitrogen decrease. The most degraded compartments, associated with the highest nutrient levels, were CB and TQ. In contrast, the upstream region of the RP branch was considered a reference site (the least impacted) for the Complex; CONCLUSION: The Billings Complex ranged from mesotrophic (RP) or eutrophic (RG) to super-eutrophic (<b>CC,</b> TQ). High <b>TSI</b> variation also occurred within compartments and/or depending on the season, mainly associated with the human management of the Complex. The surface sediments underlined the differences observed between the extremes in the Billings Complex water quality, {{as well as providing}} additional information on other impacts that was not observed from the water analysis. A slight improvement in the water quality of the Central body and the Taquacetuba branch has been observed since 2009, possibly associated with the Pinheiros River flotation project. OBJETIVOS: Este estudo visa a (a) contribuir com a avaliação espacial da qualidade da água do Complexo Billings; (b) associar informações sobre a geoquímica dos sedimentos superficiais e (c) com base em literatura, fornecer uma avaliação temporal da qualidade da água no Complexo desde a restrição do bombeamento do Rio Pinheiros; Métodos: As amostragens foram realizadas em 12 locais: 2 no Corpo Central (CB), 3 no Braço Taquacetuba (TQ); 3 no Braço Rio Pequeno (RP) e 4 na Represa Rio Grande (RG). A coleta da água foi realizada ao longo do perfil vertical no período de inverno (agosto/ 2009) e verão (fevereiro/ 2010) e a dos sedimentos superficiais (2 cm), no inverno. Foram avaliadas características físicas e químicas da água e dos sedimentos, e foi calculado o índice de estado trófico (IET) de Lamparelli; RESULTADOS: As condições limnológicas foram primordialmente influenciadas pelos períodos climáticos. No inverno, a heterogeneidade no Complexo foi mais definida com separação de seus compartimentos espaciais. Maior disponibilidade das formas nitrogenadas ocorreu no inverno, enquanto que, no verão, estas diminuíram e o fósforo apresentou aumento substancial. Os compartimentos mais degradados e associados aos maiores valores de nutrientes foram CB e TQ. De forma inversa, destaca-se o RP, cuja região a montante foi considerada de referência (menos impactada) no Complexo; CONCLUSÃO: Complexo Billings variou de mesotrófico (RP), eutrófico (RG) a supereutrófico (CB e TQ). Variação marcada do IET também ocorreu dentro dos compartimentos e dependendo do período climático, principalmente, associada ao manejo antrópico do Complexo. Os sedimentos salientaram os extremos de qualidade da água e forneceram informações adicionais sobre impactos antrópicos não detectados pela análise da água. Houve leve melhora da qualidade da água do CB e TQ a partir de 2009, possivelmente associada ao projeto de flotação do Rio Pinheiros...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundAbdominal aortic {{aneurysm}} (AAA) formation involves an inflammatory process {{with a strong}} genetic background. C-reactive protein (CRP) regulates inflammation and is elevated in patients with AAA. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the association of the triallelic (C, A, and T alleles) rs 3091244 functional CRP single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with AAA. MethodsThis was a case-control study involving two independent populations: 351 AAA patients (mean aortic diameter, 6. 25  ± 1. 47  cm) and 391 controls (mean diameter, 2. 4  ± 0. 2  cm) were recruited from Greece (the main cohort); and 371 patients (mean diameter, 5. 4  ± 1. 0  cm) and 362 controls (mean diameter, 2. 4  ± 0. 6  cm) were recruited from the United Kingdom (replication cohort). The frequency of the functional triallelic (C, T, and A alleles) rs 3091244 polymorphism was analyzed in univariate and adjusted (for cardiovascular risk factors) analyses, assuming that the rare T and A alleles have similar functional properties (pooled analysis for T and A). Three groups were constructed: group A included those with the rare T and A alleles (genotypes TT, AA, and TA), group B included heterozygotes for the C allele (CT, CA), and group C included C allele homozygotes (<b>CC,</b> <b>reference</b> genotype). Finally, meta-analysis of the two populations was performed together with previously reported results. ResultsGenotype distributions differed significantly between cases and controls in both cohorts (P  5. 5  cm were significantly more frequent among the SNP groups A and B compared with C allele homozygotes both in the main and the replication cohorts (P <. 001 and P =. 001, respectively). Meta-analysis of the two populations with previously reported results showed a positive association between minor-allele and aneurysm presence with an odds ratio of 1. 47 (95 % CI, 1. 01 - 2. 14; I 2  = 83. 1 %; P =. 04). ConclusionsThe rare T and A alleles were significantly related with AAA presence in both populations and correlated with higher CRP levels and AAA diameter. Clinical RelevanceAbdominal {{aortic aneurysm}} (AAA) constitutes a significant health problem. Several environmental factors are implicated, but the disease is recognized to have a strong genetic component. Those with a first-degree relative with AAA have up to an 11 -fold increased risk of developing the disease themselves. This study identifies a novel genetic marker that was strongly correlated with AAA presence and size. This may help identify those at risk of developing an AAA, especially of a large diameter. Additionally, the fact that this marker was correlated with raised C-reactive protein levels, points toward a strong inflammatory process underlying AAA formation...|$|R
