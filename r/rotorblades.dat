Flexible beams are providing an hinge-less robust structure onto which the piezoelectric actuators are bonded.

40|$|Accurate {{predictions}} of the aeroelastic response of a rotorcraft are essential to estimate its fatigue-life. Aeroelastic analyses are characterized by strong couplings between the aerodynamic loads and the structural response, and are very time-consuming in particular when CFD {{predictions of}} airloads are coupled with CSD models. Simple aerodynamic models do not predict {{the response of the}} system with sufficient accuracy. A novel combined numerical and experimental algorithm, the Load Confluence Algorithm, is developed to iteratively correct the numerical model of the external loads from minimal experimental data to best represent the experimental response. Aerodynamic loads are modeled with a simple approach, such as the lifting-line theory. The proposed algorithm considers the measured strains as inputs to a strain mapping algorithm. The procedure employs a modal basis estimated through a numerical model of the <b>rotorblade,</b> along with the computed periodic response to update the numerical applied loads. This paper analyzes the influence of user-defined parameters on the convergence of the proposed approach. Results for three different steady forward flight conditions demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to accurately predict the flap, lag and torsional internal moments along the blade with an accuracy that is comparable with detailed CFD analyses with a much reduced computational cost.

40|$|Following a {{comparative}} study on shape morphing and adaptive systems to improve rotorcraft efficiency, the Green Rotorcraft consortium has selected the Gurney flap technology as demonstrator of a smart adaptive <b>rotorblade</b> within the Clean Sky Joint Technology Initiative [1]. The aim {{of such a}} system is to actively increase helicopter overall performance by improving lift and alleviating static and dynamic stall on the retreating side of the helicopter [2, 3]. The Gurney flap technology will be subjected to various tests, prior to manufacturing a full-scale demonstrator. Along with wind tunnel and whirl tower tests on full blade sections, a reduced-scale blade is required to be tested on a rotary support in a wind tunnel. The aim {{is to have a}} fully operational mechanism in a 1 / 8 th-scale blade. A specific system needs to be designed for this smaller model blade. The specifications for the model blade mechanism are more challenging compared to the full model blade. The blade tip speed must remain the same between the two blades. Therefore, the model blade rotation speed and centrifugal loads greatly increase. Piezoelectric patch actuators combined with flexible beams are chosen to design a fast and robust mechanism, which would fit inside the model blade and support the large centrifugal loads. A mechanism is modeled using Finite Element Analysis tools and its geometry is optimised using a surrogate optimisation to maximise displacement and force. The optimised geometry has a Z-shape profile and maximise displacement and force. The force generated is sufficient to counter directly the force of the airflow on the flap. However, the displacement and the mechanical work are not large enough to deploy directly the Gurney flap as a conventional flap. The deployment time remains insufficient as well. Building on these results, refined geometries are under investigation using the same optimisation process...|$|R
40|$|This work {{is part of}} the European project “Clean Sky”, {{which aims}} at {{improving}} the efficiency and the global transport quality of aircraft. The research, in this project, is currently focussing on active flap systems for helicopters to adapt the blade aerodynamic properties to local aerodynamic conditions. Fuel-efficiency, reduction of vibration and noise and increase of the helicopter maximum speed are the expected benefits. To validate this technology, numerical studies and wind-tunnel testing on reduced-scale rotor blades are necessary. This thesis investigates the selection process for actuators, the methods to design and optimise actuation systems and the procedures to validate them through simulations and testing. These methods are applied to the design of an actuation system to fold and deploy a Gurney flap for a Mach-scaled rotor blade. Integrating an actuation system in helicopters is especially difficult because of a combination of challenges: tremendous loads are caused due to rotation of the blade, the space inside a <b>rotorblade</b> is limited and durability constraints need to be addressed. Piezoelectric actuators mechanisms provide potential so- lutions to meet these challenges. The selection process and experimental testing of piezoelectric actuators showed the superior characteristics of Physik Instrumente patch actuators for the purpose of integration inside a rotor blade. The design procedure starts with the investigation of the aerodynamics loads on the Gurney flap using numerical solutions. Then, an algorithm is developed to generate and optimise geometries for actuation mechanisms that comprise of piezoelectric actuators and a deformable structure. The resulting structure presents the characteristic shape of a “Z”. It amplifies the strains generated by the piezoelectric actuator to operate the Gurney flap. A multi-domain numerical validation ensures the behaviour of the mechanism under loads from the airflow and the blade rotation. Finally, a z-shaped structure prototype is manufactured and its deformation is experimentally verified. This work provides methods for implementing actuation in the very demanding environments encountered in the aeronautic field and will help the next generation of smart rotorcraft to take off...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} a methodology {{that enables the}} annual average power of a wind turbine to be increased by automatically optimizing it’s airfoil, twist and chord dis- tribution. As {{a part of the}} study the software SiteOpt has been developed. This software connects the open source software XFOIL with the blade element momen- tum theory. XFOIL gives lift and drag coefficients which enable the blade element momentum theory to predict the power of a wind turbine at different wind and ro- tational speeds. An optimization algorithm of the type genetic algorithms is used to develop a new rotor blade. An academic benchmark case (Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment Phase III) was selected as a starting point of the optimization because wind tunnel data was available for that campain. With the geometry developed by the genetic algoritm a theoretical increase of 15 % more power could be extracted. However, {{it has been shown that}} the model has shortcomings at high wind speeds where the predicted power does not match wind tunnel data. This is thought to be related to that the model assumes a completely rigid blade. In real world applica- tions a <b>rotorblade</b> will bend on higher wind speeds (about 8 m/s). It is therefore concluded that the model in its current form is flawed and that future work should aim to take these effects into account. However, a wind histogram for a specific loca- tion was used in order to calculate the annual average power for the wind turbine. The wind histogram used in this study to obtain the results has it’s wind speeds 81 % before 10 m/s where the model is acceptable. Therefore the results are largely to be considered accurate.  I denna studie presenteras en metod som möjliggör att ett vindkraftverks årliga genomsnittseffekt kan ökas genom att vingprofiler, korda- och twistdistributioner automatiskt optimeras.

40|$|The active Gurney flap {{technology}} is investigated {{to improve the}} performance of <b>rotorblades</b> by allowing helicopter blades to further control the lift unbalance that rises at high speed and by damping vibration loads on the rotor hub. This technology needs validation by wind tunnel testing of a scaled model blade under rotational loading. An optimised geometry of a flexible actuation system {{has been designed to}} provide motion for the deployment of the Gurney flap for a Mach-scale model blade [1]. This paper presents the refinement of the flexible actuation system to allow deployment of the Gurney flap and simulation strategies to model the mechanism under loads due to the blade motion and the aerodynamic forces acting on the Gurney flap. The physics domains are addressed separately to be simulated with specific software packages. A co-simulation process permits the simulation of the Gurney flap motion under LMS Virtual. Lab Motion multi-body dynamic software [2] and the simulation of the flexible mechanism under Comsol Multiphysics Finite Element Model software [3]. This simulation scheme successfully models the mechanism under harmonic loads. For faster actuation input, the co-simulation is replaced by a oneway coupling which models the deployment mechanism under loads due to the rotation of the blade, the motion of the Gurney flap and the aerodynamics. The outcome of both simulations shows that the flexible deployment system is suitable for the actuation of the Gurney flap in the two actuation cases presented.

The issue of noise emission has been adressed by reworking the generator and blades according to our latest results {{in the field of}} aerodynamic and machine noise. Now the E- 66 has to prove itself reliable and economical in regard to kWh output and manufacturing and installation costs. KWh output has already shown to be as expected and we are confident that a reasonable cost calculation can be achieved through large-scale series production and associated reduction in component costs and labour hours. It can already be said, that some components are more than three times more expensive than those for three 500 kW turbines, like e. g. the <b>rotorblades</b> that have a weight of more than three times that of a 500 kW turbine and require more labour hours. On the other hand only one foundation is required to install 1500 kW instead of three for three smaller sized turbines with 500 kW each. Also the costs for the tower of the E- 66 are lower than three times those of an E- 40 tower. Therefore the overall costs for the installation of one 1500 kW unit will not exceed those for three 500 kW wind energy converters (always taking into account price savings due to series production) and will result in economics of the MW-sized turbines that will put them into a competitive position on the market for wind energy converters.

The excellent ratio between performance, reliability and costs {{is one of the main}} benefits of using these materials. In addition, they provide the possibility of realizing new hingeless and bearingless rotor concepts with the advantage of high durability. The prominent properties of the available composite system in combination with specific design enabled ECD (Eurocopter Deutschland GmbH) to develop three different rotor systems by the stepwise substitution of Rapping- and lead-lag hinges and finally of the bearings for the pitch motion. Today, one can affirm that rotor systems without composites are inconceivable to Eurocopter. Today detailed experience is available at ECD concerning: - Two BO 108 prototyps with different sections of the primary fuselage structure fabricated in fibre reinforced composite material (first flight 1988), additional two EC 135 prototyps - adapted configuration of BO 108 to the new civil market (first flight Feb. 1994). - One experimental entire composite fuselage for ECD's BK 117 -helicopter (first flight 1989). - Full composite fuselages of all TIGER prototyps (first flight 1991). - Detailed know-how in the application of glass-and aramid fibre reinforced polymers for secondary structures for more than 25 years flying in ECD's BO 105 and BK 117 -helicopters in service, (e. g. doors, engine coulings, subfloor shell, stabilizer and fairings). ECD's wide experience in design, calculation, processing and also in the long-time behaviour in service, concerning these materials, enabled the transfer and the development of a variety of derivative structures for non helicopter specific applications (e. g. <b>rotorblades</b> for wind energy, converters and wind tunnels, solar arrays and antenna structures for space applications, composite bogies for German- and Japanese high speed railways, etc).

40|$|The design {{parameters}} axial gap and stator count of highpressure turbine stages are evaluated numerically towards theirinfluence on the unsteady aerodynamic excitation of <b>rotorblades.</b> Of particular interest is if and how unsteadyaerodynamic considerations {{in the design}} could reduce the riskofhigh cycle fatigue (HCF) failures of the turbine rotor. A well-documented 2 D/Q 3 D non-linear unsteady code (UNSFLO) is chosen to perform the stage flow analyses. The evaluatedresults are interpreted as aerodynamic excitation mechanisms onstream sheets neglecting 3 D effects. Mesh studies andvalidations against measurements and 3 D computations provideconfidence in the unsteady results. Three test cases areanalysed. First, a typical aero-engine high pressure turbinestage is studied at subsonic and transonic flow conditions,with four axial gaps (37 % - 52 % of cax,rotor) and two statorconfigurations (43 and 70 NGV). Operating conditions areaccording to the resonant conditions of the blades used inaccompanied experiments. Second, a subsonic high pressureturbine intended to drive the turbopump of a rocket engine isinvestigated. Four axial gap variations (10 % - 29 % ofcax,rotor) and three stator geometry variations are analysed toextend and generalise the findings made on the first study. Third, a transonic low pressure turbine rotor, known as theInternational Standard Configuration 11, has been modelled tocompute the unsteady flow due to blade vibration and comparedto available experimental data. Excitation mechanisms due to shock, potential waves andwakes are described and related to the work found in the openliterature. The strength of shock excitation leads to increasedpressure excitation levels by a factor 2 to 3 compared tosubsonic cases. Potential excitations are of a typical wavetype in all cases, differences in the propagation direction ofthe waves and the wave reflection pattern in the rotor passagelead to modifications in the time and space resolved unsteadypressures on the blade surface. The significant influence ofoperating conditions, axial gap and stator size on the wavepropagation is discussed on chosen cases. The wake influence onthe rotorblade unsteady pressure is small in the presentevaluations, which is explicitly demonstrated on the turbopumpturbine by a parametric study of wake and potentialexcitations. A reduction in stator size (towards R≈ 1) reduces the potential excitation part so that wake andpotential excitation approach in their magnitude. Potentials {{to reduce the risk}} of HCF excitation in transonicflow are the decrease of stator exit Mach number and themodification of temporal relations between shock and potentialexcitation events. A similar temporal tuning of wake excitationto shock excitation appears not efficient because of the smallwake excitation contribution. The increase of axial gap doesnot necessarily decrease the shock excitation strength neitherdoes the decrease of vane size because the shock excitation mayremain strong even behind a smaller stator. The evaluation ofthe aerodynamic excitation towards a HCF risk reduction shouldonly be done with regard to the excited mode shape, asdemonstrated with parametric studies of the mode shapeinfluence on excitability.
