5000|$|The rim of this crater {{is open to}} the {{southwest}} and the crater is elongated to the northeast, possibly due to a merged crater. The outer rim varies in height, with the most prominent sections being {{the southwest}} face and a ridge mount to the northwest. The interior floor has been flooded with basaltic lava, an unusual feature for a crater on the far side. The interior floor is generally flat, and marked by a number of small craters. However, there are some low ridges in the surface that are concentric with the inner wall. A formation of irregular ridges occupies most of the <b>rim</b> <b>gap</b> along the southwest.Bowditch is described in the Apollo 15 Preliminary Science Report, along with Lacus Oblivionis to the south, as a significant volcanic feature: ...|$|E
40|$|An {{electric}} rim driven thruster is {{a relatively}} new marine propulsion device and the associated fluid dynamics have not been fully investigated. This work develops a robust CFD method and investigates both frozen rotor and unsteady simulations of rotor–stator interaction. Two solvers from OpenFOAM were used. Steady state simulations were performed using MRFSimpleFoam with a frozen rotor treatment of the interface between static and rotational reference frames. The solver for unsteady simulations was pimpleDyMFoam, utilising a sliding mesh interface to handle the dynamic meshing. Both methods are thoroughly verified and validated against experimental data. The k–omega SST turbulence model is found to be robust down to low advance ratios. For the rim driven thruster, analytical models are used to estimate friction forces in the <b>rim</b> <b>gap</b> and their contribution to torque losses. The frozen rotor and unsteady treatments of rotor–stator interaction are compared and found to have similar trends in the variation of thrust produced. However, the frozen rotor method does not predict the same variation of instantaneous torque and does not capture the rotor–stator interaction fully. Analysis of the unsteady rotor–stator interaction shows an oscillating flow over the stators and thus inflow to the blade...|$|E

50|$|Oersted is a lunar crater {{that has}} been flooded by lava, leaving only a {{crescent-shaped}} <b>rim</b> with a <b>gap</b> to the southwest. The rim climbs to a maximum height of 1.7 km.

A smaller crater has broken into the eastern <b>rim,</b> leaving a <b>gap</b> where the two craters intersect that has been covered in lava. A similar-sized ghost crater lies just inside the northern rim, producing a raised ring in the crater surface. Another such formation lies just outside the southern rim of Baldet.|$|R

40|$|International audienceChlorine {{is present}} as an {{impurity}} in the UO 2 nuclear fuel. 35 Cl is activated into 36 Cl by thermal neutron capture. In case of interim storage or deep geological disposal of the spent fuel, this isotope {{is known to}} be able to contribute significantly to the instant release fraction because of its mobile behavior and its long half life (around 300000 years). It is therefore important to understand its migration behavior within the fuel rod. During reactor operation, chlorine diffusion can be due to thermally activated processes or can be favoured by irradiation defects induced by fission fragments or alpha decay. In order to decouple both phenomena, we performed two distinct experiments to study the effects of thermal annealing on the behaviour of chlorine on one hand and the effects of the irradiation with fission products on the other hand. During in reactor processes, part of the 36 Cl may be displaced from its original position, due to recoil or to collisions with fission products. In order to study the behavior of the displaced chlorine, 37 Cl has been implanted into sintered depleted UO 2 pellets (mean grain size around 18 µm). The spatial distribution of the implanted and pristine chlorine has been analyzed by SIMS before and after treatment. Thermal annealing of 37 Cl implanted UO 2 pellets (implantation fluence of 1013 ions. cm- 2) show that it is mobile from temperatures as low as 1273 K (Ea= 4. 3 eV). The irradiation with fission products (Iodine, E= 63. 5 MeV) performed at 300 and 510 K, shows that the diffusion of chlorine is enhanced and that a thermally activated contribution is preserved (Ea= 0. 1 eV). The diffusion coefficients measured at 1473 K and under fission product irradiation at 510 K are similar (D = 3. 10 - 14 cm 2. s- 1). Considering in first approximation that the diffusion length L can be expressed {{as a function of the}} diffusion coefficient D and time t by : L=(Dt) 1 / 2, the diffusion distance after 3 years is L= 17 µm. It results that there is a great probability for the chlorine contained in the UO 2 grains to have reached the grain boundaries after 3 years, in the core of the fuel rod as well as at its periphery. Moreover, diffusion and concentration of chlorine at grain boundaries has been evidenced using SIMS mapping. Our results indicate therefore, that, during reactor operation and after, the majority of 36 Cl is likely to have moved to grain boundaries, <b>rim</b> and <b>gap.</b> This fraction might then significantly contribute to the rapid or instant release of chlorine. This could have important consequences for safety assessment...|$|R
40|$|Our {{aim is to}} {{determine}} the presence and location of the emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) towards low and intermediate mass young stars with disks using large aperture telescopes. VLT-VISIR N-band spectra and VLT-ISAAC and VLT-NACO L-band spectra of 29 sources are presented, spectrally resolving the 3. 3, 8. 6, 11. 2, and 12. 6 micron PAH features. Spatial-extent profiles of the features and the continuum emission are derived and used to associate the PAH emission with the disks. The results are discussed in the context of recent PAH-emission disk models. The 3. 3, 8. 6, and 11. 2 micron PAH features are detected toward {{a small fraction of the}} T Tauri stars, with typical upper limits between 1 E- 15 and 5 E- 17 W/m^ 2. All 11. 2 micron detections from a previous Spitzer survey are confirmed with (tentative) 3. 3 micron detections, and both the 8. 6 and the 11. 2 micron features are detected in all PAH sources. For 6 detections, the spatial extent of the PAH features is confined to scales typically smaller than 0. 12 - 0. 34 '', consistent with the radii of 12 - 60 AU disks at their distances (typically 150 pc). For 3 additional sources, WL 16, HD 100546, and TY CrA, one or more of the PAH features are more extended than the hot dust continuum of the disk, whereas for Oph IRS 48, the size of the resolved PAH emission is confirmed as smaller than for the large grains. For HD 100546, the 3. 3 micron emission is confined to a small radial extent of 12 +- 3 AU, most likely associated with the outer <b>rim</b> of the <b>gap</b> in this disk. Gaps with radii out to 10 - 30 AU may also affect the observed PAH extent for other sources. For both Herbig Ae and T Tauri stars, the small measured extents of the 8. 6 and 11. 2 micron features are consistent with larger (>= 100 carbon atoms) PAHs.

40|$|Engine {{components}} are commonly {{exposed to air}} temperatures exceeding the thermal material limit {{in order to increase}} the overall engine performance and to maximise the engine specific fuel consumption. To prevent the overheating of the materials and thus the reduction of the component life, an internal flow system must be designed to cool the critical engine parts and to protect them. As the coolant flow is bled from the compressor and not used for the combustion an important goal is to minimise the amount of coolant in order to optimise the overall engine performance. Predicting the metal temperatures is of paramount importance as they are a major factor in determining the component stresses and lives. In addition, as modern engines operate in ever harsher conditions due to efficiency requirements, the ability to predict thermo-mechanical displacements becomes very relevant: on the one hand, to prevent damage of components due to excessive rubbing, on the other hand, to understand how much air is flowing internally within the secondary air system for cooling and sealing purposes, not only in the design condition but throughout the engine life-span. In order to achieve this aero-engine manufacturers aim to use more and more accurate numerical techniques requiring multi-physics models, including thermo-mechanical finite elements and CFD models, which can be coupled in order to investigate small variations in temperatures and displacements. This thesis shows a practical application and extension of a numerical methodology for predicting conjugate heat transfer. Extensive use is made of FEA (solids) and CFD (fluid) modeling techniques to understand the thermo-mechanical behaviour of a turbine stator well cavity, due to the interaction of cooling air supply with the main annulus. Previous work based on the same rig showed diffculties in matching predictions to thermocouple measurements near the <b>rim</b> seal <b>gap.</b> In this investigation, further use is made of existing measurements of hot running seal clearances in the rig. The structural deflections are applied to the existing model to evaluate the impact in flow interactions and heat transfer. Furthermore, for one test case unsteady CFD simulations are conducted in order {{to take into account the}} flow unsteadiness in the heat transfer predictions near the rim. In addition to a baseline test case without net ingestion, a case simulating engine deterioration with net ingestion is validated against the available test data, also taking into account cold and hot running seal clearances. Furthermore an additional geometry with a stationary deflector plate is modelled and validated for the same flow cases. Experiments as well as numerical simulations have shown that due to the deflector plate the cooling flow is fed more directly into the disc boundary layer, allowing more effective use of less cooling air, leading to improved engine efficiency. Therefore, the deflector plate geometry is embedded in a CFD-based automated optimisation loop to further reduce the amount of cooling air. The optimisation strategy concentrates on a flexible design parameterisation of the cavity geometry with deflector plate and its implementation in an automatic 3 D meshing system with respect of finally executing an automated design optimisation. Special consideration is given to the flexibility of the parameterisation method in order to reduce design variables to a minimum while also increasing the design space flexibility & generality. The parameterised geometry is optimised using a metamodel-assisted approach based on regressing Kriging in order to identify the optimum position and orientation of the deflector plate inside the cavity. The outcome of the optimisation is validated using the benchmarked FEA-CFD coupling methodology...|$|R
