5|$|In 1996, the underwire of a girl's bra {{helped save}} her life when she was impaled on a <b>railing</b> <b>and,</b> {{according}} to hospital personnel, the underwire from her bra probably helped deflect the spike from her heart. There have been multiple incidents where bullets were deflected by the underwire of a woman's bra, either keeping her entirely from harm, or directing the bullet away from the heart {{to another part of}} the body.|$|E
5|$|The 1866 {{construction}} was considerably stronger, {{compared to the}} two previous spans, due to major renovations. The old cables that snapped {{had been replaced by}} newer, stronger ones. Thomas also gave the span a new deck floor, a bridge <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> new stringers. The bridge was much better cared for this time around, as it also survived a local flood in 1903 and an icestorm in the early months of spring 1904.|$|E
5|$|Detective Mike Banner invites Chris for an {{interview}} {{in relation to the}} murder. Beforehand, Chris throws Mrs. Eastby's jewelry and drugs into the river, but by chance her ring bounces on the <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> falls to the pavement. At the police station, Chris lies about his relationship with Nola, but Banner surprises him with her diary, in which he is featured extensively. He confesses his affair but denies any link to the murder, and appeals to the detectives not to involve him further in their investigation as news of the affair may end his marriage just as he and his wife are expecting a baby.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the guns were small iron guns with short range that could be aimed and fired by a single person. The two most common are the bases, breech-loading swivel guns, most likely placed in the castles, and hailshot pieces, small muzzle-loaders with rectangular bores and fin-like protrusions {{that were used to}} support the guns against the <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> allow the ship structure to take the force of the recoil. Though the design is unknown, there were two top pieces in a 1546 inventory (finished after the sinking) which was probably similar to a base, but placed in {{one or more of the}} fighting tops.|$|E
5|$|Camak House, at 279 Meigs Street, Athens, Georgia, {{was built}} in about 1834 by James Camak and {{featured}} in Georgia's early railroad history. An example of Federal architecture, it {{has a number of}} features unusual for its period, including a kitchen within the raised basement and closets. Both main floors have four rooms; the stairwell has a mahogany <b>railing,</b> <b>and</b> moldings and trim were made using a Greek key pattern. After long service as a family home, it was used as a Masonic Lodge before being bought by Coca-Cola Enterprises. In 1975 Camak House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but the building had by then fallen into disrepair. It was restored and used as the offices of a law firm. As of December 2011, it is for sale.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th {{inning of}} a tied game on July 1, 2004, against their rivals, the Boston Red Sox, Trot Nixon hit a pop fly down the left field line. Jeter ran from his {{position}} at shortstop and made an over-the-shoulder catch. He launched himself over the third-base side <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> two rows of seats, receiving a lacerated chin and bruised face. The Yankees {{went on to win}} the game in the bottom of the 13th inning. This was voted the Play of the Year in the This Year in Baseball Awards competition, as voted on by fans at MLB.com. Following the 2004 season, Jeter was presented with his first Gold Glove Award; his diving catch on July 1 was cited as a reason for the award. Though Jeter was fourth among shortstops in fielding percentage and errors, two traditional fielding statistics, critics pointed to his lower ratings in the more advanced sabermetric statistics, such as range factor and ultimate zone rating (UZR).|$|E

Sosnovka is the largest park within the limits of the city proper, occupying 240 ha. The Summer Garden is the oldest one, dating back to the early 18th century and designed in the regular style. It is situated on the southern bank of the Neva {{at the head of the}} Fontanka and is famous for its cast iron <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> marble sculptures.|$|E
25|$|The House of Lords {{has also}} been {{targeted}} by protesters. On 2February 1988, the House debated the Local Government Bill's controversial Clause 28, a measure to prohibit the promotion of homosexuality in schools. Following the division, in which the clause passed, a number of lesbian demonstrators in the public gallery started chanting slogans, and three of them tied ropes to the <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> climbed down onto {{the floor of the}} Chamber. Lord Monkswell, who had provided the women with passes to attend the debate, later apologised to the House for the incident but did not criticise the protest.|$|E

25|$|The fifth {{match was}} between The Undertaker and Rob Van Dam (RVD) for RVD's WWF Hardcore Championship. Earlier in the match, RVD hit The Undertaker with a top-rope somersault. Undertaker crotched RVD {{on the top}} rope and knocked him to the outside. He tried to drive him into the ringpost, but RVD {{reversed}} and knocked him into the ringpost instead. RVD attacked The Undertaker with the barricade, and tried to hit a bodypress but The Undertaker punched him. The Undertaker tossed him over a <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> choked RVD on the floor. The Undertaker tried to use a steel chair, but RVD hit him with a fire extinguisher. He hit The Undertaker's head with a trash can, and a flying crossbody. They fought on the stage where RVD hit a somersault leg drop. The Undertaker drove RVD's head on the stage, and attempted a Last Ride, but RVD held onto stage. The Undertaker went backstage {{and came back with}} a chair but RVD kicked it. He hit a Rolling Thunder on the stage and a Chair Surf. He tried to hit a Van Daminator but missed, and The Undertaker hit him with the chair. The Undertaker chokeslammed RVD off the stage through a set of tables for the victory, and won his first and only WWF Hardcore Championship.|$|E
500|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone was first noted on July11 east of Luzon. It moved generally to the west-northwest {{for a few}} days before curving to the northwest. On July15, the steamer [...] Tjikandi encountered the typhoon, estimating winds of 160km/h (100mph); two quartermasters were washed overboard, and the <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> hatches were wrecked. On July17, the typhoon struck southeastern Taiwan and moved across the southern portion of the island, where Hengchun recorded a barometric pressure of 978mbar (28.89inHg). Crossing the Taiwan Strait, the storm entered southeastern China near Xiamen on July17, and dissipated the next day.|$|E
500|$|.....as soon as I got out I {{climbed on}} to the <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> threw myself out to the wire-netting, a {{distance}} of between 20 and 30 feet. The idea in my mind was [...] "one big tragedy may save many others". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw myself from the top, as I meant, {{on to the}} iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, {{as it was a}} clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught {{on the edge of the}} netting. I then threw myself forward on my head with all my might.|$|E

500|$|The {{co-operation}} {{was short-lived}} and arguments over maintenance started again in 1834 when the Buckinghamshire side needed repairs and Berkshire refused to contribute. Lack of maintenance {{led to the}} bridge collapsing once more in 1836 and the counties {{came up with the}} unique solution of each building their own half. Buckinghamshire decided to rebuild with wooden railings whilst Berkshire built its half in iron suspended by chains. [...] Kelly's Directory of 1847 noted: [...] "Datchet is separated from Windsor by the river Thames, over which is a very singular bridge; one half of it is kept in repair by the county of Bucks and the other half by Berks. The former has a wooden <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> the latter an iron one, suspended by chains, but neither the Bucks nor Berks sides touch each other." ...|$|E
500|$|When Canaletto {{painted a}} view of the garden looking north from the Duke of Richmond's dining room in Richmond House in 1747, it was a last view of a {{prospect}} that was soon to disappear with the demolition of the old palace's Holbein Gate adjoining the garden. Parliament Street was driven through the western side of the garden in 1750 to connect Whitehall to the Palace of Westminster. At the start of the 19th century the garden's [...] "decayed wall, long fringed by pamphlets, ballads, and ragged advertisements" [...] was removed and replaced by an iron <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> newly planted trees. Its north side remained [...] "most confused and unpleasant", terminating in a maze of [...] "fifty narrow passages, formed by sheds, blank walls, the residences of the nobility, and the workshops of the tradesmen." ...|$|E
500|$|Out of the {{starting}} gate, Ecole Etage took the lead, ahead of Torsion, while race favorite Secretariat exited last. Sham and Deadly Dream made contact exiting the gate. While Sham {{was able to}} successfully gain stride, Deadly Dream began to run towards the <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> collided with it when entering the first turn. Going into the course's first turn, Secretariat passed two horses {{on the outside and}} passed the remainder as the horses entered the backstretch. Sham was the only horse that was able to stay with Secretariat's acceleration. Secretariat held the lead {{for the remainder of the}} race and crossed the finish line in first position, [...] lengths ahead of Sham. Our Native placed third, eight lengths behind Sham. This was the first time in the history of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes that the top three horses in the Derby finished in the same positions at the Preakness.|$|E
