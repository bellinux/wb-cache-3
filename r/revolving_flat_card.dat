Version E was a modified unit to fit on railroad <b>flat</b> <b>cards</b> to produce a mobile Flak radar system. Version G had the 2.4-meter antenna and electronics from a Freya installed. The antenna dipoles were inside the reflector. The reason for this was that the allies were flying very high recon flights which were at altitudes above the maximum height of the Freya. The standard Würzburg Riese's 50 cm beam was to narrow to fid them directly. So by combining the two systems the Freya could set the Würzburg Riese onto the target.|$|R

In this paper, an approach to transmitting and presenting the figure of a person at a remote location in real time, an implementation of a prototype system based on this approach, and the evaluation of the prototype system using the approach are described. In our approach, images of a person are captured from all around using multiple cameras, transmitted through a network, and displayed on a <b>revolving</b> <b>flat</b> panel display that is capable of presenting different images according to the orientation of the viewing position; the revolving display presents each image so that it is visible exclusively at the orientation from which it was taken, and consequently, an image of the person that can be viewed from various directions is realized. Through the implementation of the prototype system and experiments, it was confirmed that the proposed approach is feasible and that the prototype system functions effectively.

USE - Used to make a contact-less smart card with potentially extremely wide application in private and public life. ADVANTAGE - The process manufactures non-contact smart cards, producing the coils especially, at low cost. Resistance to mechanical stress and reliability are good. Single stage processes are employed where possible. Hot Stamp coil application is particularly economic and adhesive on the coil underside completes attachment. High production rates are achieved. The coil transfers data and/or e nergy, acting as an antenna. Of various applicable mounting technologies, the flip-chip method is particularly compact.

If surface lightness is to be a reliable guide to surface identity, observers must compensate for such changes. To the extent they do, observers are said to be lightness constant.

On each trial, observers viewed an achromatic standard object and indicated the best match from a palette of 36 grayscale samples.

First, data for most observers were neither luminance matches nor lightness constant matches. Second, there were large and reliable individual differences.

I think, however, that you boys ought to be shewn experiments that you can make at home; and so here is a very pretty experiment in illustration of the pressure of the atmosphere. Here is a tumbler of water. Suppose I were to ask you to turn that tumbler upside-down, so that the water should not fall out, and yet not be kept in by your hand, but merely by using the pressure of the atmosphere.

40|$|Tomographic {{particle}} image velocimetry {{was used}} to explore the evolution of three-dimensional flow structures of <b>revolving</b> low-aspect-ratio <b>flat</b> plates in combination with force measurements at a Reynolds number of 10, 000. Two motion kinematics are compared that result in the same terminal condition (revolution with constant angular velocity and 45 ? angle of attack) but differ in the motion during the buildup phase: pitching while revolving at a constant angular velocity; or surging with a constant acceleration at a fixed angle of attack. Comparison of force histories shows that the pitching wing generates considerably higher forces during the buildup phase which is also predicted by a quasi-steady model quite accurately. The difference in the buildup phases affects the force histories until six chords of travel {{after the end of}} buildup phase. In both cases, a vortex system that is comprised of a leading-edge vortex (LEV), a tip vortex and a trailing edge vortex is formed during the initial period of the motion. The LEV lifts off, forms an arch-shaped structure and bursts into substructures, which occur at slightly different phases of the motions, such that the revolving–surging wing flow evolution precedes that of the revolving–pitching wing. The delay is shown to be in accordance with the behavior of the spanwise flow which is affected by the interaction between the tip vortex and revolving dynamics. Further analysis shows that the enhanced force generation of the revolving–pitching wing during the pitch-up phase originates from: (1) increased magnitude and growth rate of the LEV circulation; (2) relatively favorable position and trajectory of the LEV and the starting vortex; and (3) generation of bound circulation during the pitching motion, whereas that of the revolving–surging wing is negligible in the acceleration phase.

Each measurement was replicated 5 times. Wing color spots were analyzed with a light dissection microscope (stereoscope) and with scanning electron microscopy. The scales have a minimum of 4 morphological types, 3 of them showed the typical appearance of unspecialized scales described for other butterflies; whereas the fourth has features particular to this species. On the "window "the scales are transformed in hair-like bristles that do not interfere with light, conferring the transparency that characterizes the "windows ". However,if the wing is illuminated at an almost grazing-incidence,they reflect the light as a mirror.
