5|$|Outside Poland, Sienkiewicz's {{popularity}} declined {{beginning in}} the interbellum, except for Quo Vadis, which retained relative fame thanks to several film adaptations, including a notable American one in 1951. In Poland his works are still widely read; he {{is seen as a}} classic author, and his works are often <b>required</b> <b>reading</b> in schools. They have also been adapted for Polish films and television series.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{military}} texts written before {{the unification of}} China and Shi Huangdi's subsequent book burning {{in the second century}} BC, six major works have survived. During the much later Song dynasty, these six works were combined with a Tang text into a collection called the Seven Military Classics. As a central part of that compilation, The Art of War formed the foundations of orthodox military theory in early modern China. Illustrating this point, the book was <b>required</b> <b>reading</b> to pass the tests for imperial appointment to military positions.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Wang Anshi {{had his own}} {{commentaries on}} Confucian {{classics}} made into a standard and <b>required</b> <b>reading</b> for students hoping to pass the state examinations. This and other reforms of Wang's were too much for some officials to bear idly, as there were many administrative disagreements, along with many personal interests at stake. In any case, the rising conservative faction against the reformer Wang Anshi branded him as an inferior-intellect who was not up to par with their principles of governance (likewise, the reformers branded conservatives in the same labeled fashion). The conservatives criticized Wang's reforms {{as a means of}} curbing the influence of landholding families by diminishing their private wealth in favor of self-sufficient communal groups. The conservatives argued that the wealth of the landholding class should not be purposefully diminished by state programs, since the land holding class was the essential socio-economic group that produced China's scholar-officials, managers, merchants, and landlords.|$|E

25|$|Many of Steinbeck's {{works are}} <b>required</b> <b>reading</b> in American high schools. In the United Kingdom, Of Mice and Men {{is one of}} the key texts used by the {{examining}} body AQA for its English Literature GCSE. A study by the Center for the Learning and Teaching of Literature in the United States found that Of Mice and Men was one of the ten most frequently read books in public high schools. Contra-wise, Steinbeck's works have been frequently banned in the United States. The Grapes of Wrath was banned by school boards: in August 1939, Kern County Board of Supervisors banned the book from the county's publicly funded schools and libraries. It was burned in Salinas on two different occasions. In 2003, a school board in Mississippi banned it on the grounds of profanity. According to the American Library Association Steinbeck was one of the ten most frequently banned authors from 1990 to 2004, with Of Mice and Men ranking sixth out of 100 such books in the United States.|$|E
25|$|His {{most widely}} known book, Cocorí, {{was a short}} novel {{published}} in 1947. The book follows a titular character in his search for why a flower lived only one day. In 1994, the book was made <b>required</b> <b>reading</b> in Costa Rican schools. The character of Cocorí was Afro-Caribbean. The qualities he portrays in the book raised accusations of racism, notably from fellow Costa Rican author Quince Duncan, human rights activist Epsy Campbell Barr, and others working on behalf of Proyecto Caribe, an organization devoted to promoting Afro-Caribbean rights. They claimed that ugliness was associated with being of African descent and that the comparisons of the character Cocorí to monkeys create a damaging image. Guitiérrez's supporters countered that Cocorí ennobled Afro-Caribbeans. Eventually, in 2003, {{under the direction of}} Wilfrido Blanco Mora, the Ministry of Public Education dropped the requirement that Cocorí be read in public schools. For his part, when the issue of racism in Cocorí was first raised in the early 1980s, Gutiérrez said that there were no racist elements to the book. Cocorí was translated into more than 10 languages and sold more than 750,000 copies around the world.|$|E

30|$|In {{the first}} category, adaptations to the {{language}} of the activities and materials of the SFP were suggested. Suggested language adaptations included changing the names of cars, games, objects, and places as well as typically English day-to-day activities for others common in Brazil: for example, replacing “family crest” for “family flag.” Other suggestions for activities included the use of strategies that do not <b>require</b> <b>reading</b> or writing, as a significant number of the adults were illiterate and younger children presented difficulty reading, and customizing the playful activities to the developmental necessities of the younger children (10) and older adolescents (14). Finally, examples of suggested adaptations for materials include improving the quality of dubbing and sound of the DVDs, including extended family—beyond grandparents—who might offer support in the branches of the “family tree” activity (session 2), thus taking into account multiple family configurations and adapting the activities that <b>require</b> <b>reading,</b> as the illiteracy of the parents/guardians affects the engagement and length of the activity, compromising fidelity.|$|R
