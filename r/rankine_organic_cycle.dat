Optimizations are carried out for eight hydrocarbon mixtures for hot fluid inlet temperatures at 120 °C and 90 °C, using a genetic algorithm to determine the cycle conditions for which the net power output is maximized.

The processes were compared based on their off-design performance for diesel engine loads in the range between 25 % and 100 %. The fluids considered in the <b>organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycle</b> process were MM(hexamethyldisiloxane), toluene, n-pentane, i-pentane and c-pentane. The results of the comparison indicate that the net power output of the steam Rankine cycle process is higher at high engine loads, while the performance of the <b>organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycle</b> units is higher at lower loads.

The fluid-dynamic design of <b>organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycle</b> turbines can benefit from computational fluid dynamics tools which are capable of properly taking into account real-gas effects occurring in the turbine, which typically expands in the nonideal-gas thermodynamic region.

40|$|The <b>organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycle</b> is a {{suitable}} technology for utilizing low grade heat for electricity production. Compared {{to the traditional}} steam <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycle,</b> the <b>organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycle</b> is beneficial, since it enables {{the choice of a}} working fluid which performs better than steam at low heat input temperatures and at lowpower outputs. Selecting the process layout of the <b>organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycle</b> and the working fluid are two key design decisions which are critical for the thermodynamic and economic performance of the cycle. The prevailing approach used in the design and optimization of <b>organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycles</b> is to model the heatexchangers by assuming a fixed minimum temperature difference. The objective of this work is to assess the applicability of this conventional optimization approach and a non-conventional optimization approach. In thenon-conventional optimization approach a total UA-value (the product of the overall heat transfer coefficient and the heat transfer area) is assigned to the cycle, while the distribution of this total UA-value to each of the heat exchangers is optimized. Optimizations are carried out for three different marine engine waste heatsources at temperatures ranging from 90 °C to 285 °C. The results suggest that the conventional optimization approach is not suitable for estimating the performance potential when the temperature profiles in the heat exchangers are closely matched. This is exemplified for the fluid MDM where the temperature profile of preheating aligns with the heat source fluid and for the zeotropic mixture R 32 /R 134 a where the temperature profile of condensation aligns with the cooling water. Furthermore, the conventional optimization approach shows weaknesses in evaluating the feasibility of using a recuperator, when the expander outlet temperature is high. In these cases the non-conventional optimization approach is the more suited methodology for designing <b>organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycles...</b>|$|R

This work examines <b>organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycles</b> for use in a polygeneration plant that converts coal feedstock into hydrocarbon products and electricity. Since a Fischer Tropsch reactor is the largest source of low grade heat in the polygeneration plant, rejecting heat at a constant temperature of 240 °C, the analysis in this work focuses on utilizing the waste heat from this process. <b>Organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycles</b> (ORC's) are modeled in MATLAB using pure substance data available from Refprop 8. 0. Various working fluids are considered, with a particular focus on hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, and decane. Hexane is the best option for the Fischer Tropsch heat source and the working fluids considered here. A set of ORC design concepts (building blocks) is developed to allow a cycle to be matched to a generic heat source, and is demonstrated using the Fischer Tropsch heat source profile. The low pressure steam Rankine cycle achieves a 20. 6 % conversion, while a baseline hexane <b>organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycle</b> achieves a 26. 2 % conversion efficiency for the same Fischer Tropsch heat source. If the ORC building blocks are combined into a cycle targeted to match the temperature-enthalpy profile of the heat source, this customized hexane cycle achieves 28. 5 % conversion efficiency. For a polygeneration plant with a 25, 000 ton per day input of coal, the conversion efficiency is improved by 0. 3 to 0. 5 points. Moreover, by combining the ORC building blocks identified in this work into new configurations, cycle designers can create customized <b>organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycles</b> that target any heat source temperature-enthalpy profile to achieve improved conversion efficiencies. by Kevin J.
