But there was always the risk of waking her!--to what? The fear of being confronted again with HER fear and of being unable to pacify her, at last decided him to remain. But he crept softly through the grass, and in the dust of the track traced the four points of the compass, as he could still determine them by the sunset light, with a large printed W to indicate the west! This boyish contrivance particularly pleased him. If he had only had a pole, a stick, or even a twig, on which to tie his handkerchief and erect it above the clump of mesquite as a signal to the searchers in case they should be overcome by fatigue or sleep, he would have been happy. But the plain was barren of brush or timber; he did not dream that this omission and the very unobtrusiveness of his hiding-place would be his salvation from a greater danger.|$|E

Despite losing all the attractiveness of world, she has created the high-spirited environment in her house to cherish every <b>remaining</b> <b>moments</b> of life. Maheen (Ayeza Khan), the maternal granddaughter of Kaneez Begum, is kind of short-tempered, egoistic but still the apple of everyone’s eye in the family. Waqar (Imran Abbas), another grandson of Kaneez Begum returns from London and starts taking interest in Maheen. Although they both were hiding their feelings but Kaneez Begum gets the temperature of their love affair which is against her wish. She wants to tie the knot between Maheen and Gulraiz (Shehzad Sheikh) and announces their engagement. Gulraiz is a shy, poltroon and introvert type of person although he loves Maheen deep down inside. Maheen’s sister Fajar interrupts the matriarch order and convinces Waqar and Maheen to openly claim their love interest. When Gulraiz gets to know the real feelings of Maheen, he himself decided to sacrifice from this relationship. It seems like when life is going on the right track as per Maheen’s wish, fate has something else in store for her. The fire of jealousy, grudge and hate turns the love into flying ashes. Sometime love takes you into the situation when you start¬ hating its existence.|$|E

A amostra foi composta por duas classes consideradas "difíceis" (cujas equipes pedagógicas tinham relatado haver inúmeros problemas de comportamento e de relacionamento tanto entre os próprios alunos, quanto com os professores e com relação à realização das atividades e obediência às regras) e duas classes consideradas "não difíceis" (em que os alunos apresentavam boas notas; poucas notificações; percebiam a turma como "boa"; faziam as atividades na classe e realizavam as lições de casa; havia pouca indisciplina; pouca movimentação e predomínio do silêncio; as regras eram mais obedecidas) de duas escolas do Ensino Fundamental II de uma cidade do {{interior}} do estado de São Paulo. Os participantes foram estudantes do sextos e sétimos anos e as respectivas equipes pedagógicas. Os dados foram coletados de três formas: pela realização de entrevistas (que foram gravadas em áudio e transcritas) com alunos e integrantes da equipe; a partir de observações semanais das interações sociais, tanto durante as aulas quanto nos demais momentos da rotina diária dos alunos e dos professores; e pela coleta de materiais, como registro das ocorrências, agendas, fichas de acompanhamento, planejamentos dos professores, atas de reuniões e conselhos de classe. A análise qualitativa dos dados indicou que em todas as classes investigadas havia uma supervalorização das regras convencionais, muitas sem significado, não havendo espaços para a discussão ou criação das normas, que normalmente eram criadas pela autoridade objetivando impedir que os conflitos interpessoais ocorressem, sendo que seu descumprimento estava associado às sanções expiatórias. Os conflitos interpessoais eram vistos como negativos, portanto deveriam ser evitados e contidos. A culpabilização e transferência para as famílias dos problemas enfrentados no ambiente escolar não favorecia a mudança de comportamento dos alunos. As aulas eram desprovidas de significado, organizadas sempre da mesma forma, favorecendo situações de indisciplina nas classes "difíceis" e de indisciplina velada nas classes "não difíceis". Nas classes "difíceis" o diálogo era desrespeitoso e hostil por ambas as partes: tanto professores como os alunos mantinham uma relação de enfrentamento constante, havia inúmeras situações de incivilidades, que produziam grande cansaço e estresse. As relações com os docentes eram mais tensas, os professores reconheciam a dificuldade em lidar com as turmas. Os alunos resistiam mais às regras da escola e às orientações dos professores e eram mais questionadores. Já nas classes "não difíceis" havia maior obediência e submissão, sendo que o diálogo era menos desrespeitoso, pois os alunos se submetiam mais às regras impostas, tentando corresponder às expectativas dos docentes. A relação entre pares também influenciou no ambiente de cada tipo de classe, assim como o desempenho acadêmico dos alunos. Essa pesquisa evidencia uma revisão urgente do ambiente sociomoral das escolas. Mais do que resolver o problema das classes "difíceis", é necessário repensar a escola como um todo. Abstracts: This is {{a descriptive}} exploratory study, {{based on the}} constructivist theory of Jean Piaget, which aimed to characterize classrooms considered "difficult" and "not difficult", identifying common and/or divergent factors in their organization and also investigate the socio-moral environment regarding the work with the knowledge, interpersonal relationships, rules and social conflicts of the classrooms considered "difficult" and "not difficult" by the teaching staff. The sample was composed of two classrooms considered "difficult" (whose pedagogical teams had reported having numerous behavioral problems and relationship problems both between the students themselves, as with teachers and the performance in pedagogical activities and the obedience to the rules) and two classes considered "not difficult" (in which students had good grades; few notifications; people perceived the classrooms as "good"; the students performed all of the proposed activities in class, and also did their homework; there was little discipline, little movement around the class during the activities and the predominance of silence; the rules were more obeyed) of two schools Elementary School of a city {{in the state of}} São Paulo. The participants were students' grades and their pedagogical teams of the sixth and seventh. Data were collected in three ways: by conducting interviews (which were audio-recorded and transcribed) with students and staff members; from weekly observations of social interactions, both in class and in the <b>remaining</b> <b>moments</b> of the daily routine of students and teachers; and for the gathering of materials, such as the record of events made by teachers, schedules, monitoring reports, teachers' schedules, meeting minutes and class councils minutes. The qualitative analysis of the data indicated that in all classrooms observed there was an overvaluation of conventional rules, many of which were meaningless, and {{there was no room for}} discussion or creation of the rules, which were typically created by authority aiming to prevent the occurrence of interpersonal conflicts, and the noncompliance of these rules was associated to expiatory penalties. Interpersonal conflicts were seen as negative, so they should be avoided and contained. The blame and transfer of the problems to the families in the school environment did not favor changing students' behavior. Classes were meaningless, always organized in the same way, favoring indiscipline situations in "difficult" classroom and veiled indiscipline in "not difficult" classrooms. In the "difficult" classrooms, the dialogue was disrespectful and hostile from both parties: both teachers and students maintained a constant relationship of coping, there were numerous situations of incivilities which produced great fatigue and stress. Relationships between students and teachers were more tense. The teachers recognized the difficulty in dealing with these classrooms. Students resisted much more over the rules of the school such as the guidelines of the teachers, questioning more. In the "difficult" classrooms, there was greater obedience and submission, and the dialogue was less disrespectful because the students were more subjected to the imposed rules, trying to meet the expectations of their teachers. The relationship between peers has also influenced the environment of each type of classroom as well as the academic performance of students. This research highlights an urgent review of the sociomoral environment in schools. Rather than solve the problem of "difficult" classrooms, it is necessary to rethink the reality of schools...|$|E
