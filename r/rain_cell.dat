A portion of atmosphere that has rain in it, or a <b>rain</b> <b>cell,</b> has the characteristic of attenuating and de-polarizing EM signals that pass through it. The attenuation of such a signal is approximately proportional to the square of the frequency of the signal, and the de-polarization is proportional to the shape distribution of raindrops in the <b>rain</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E
50|$|Total rain {{attenuation}} is also {{dependent upon}} the spatial structure of rain field. Horizontal as well vertical extension of rain again varies for different rain type and location. Limit of the vertical rain region is usually assumed to coincide with 0 degree isotherm and called rain height. Melting layer height is also used as the limits of rain region and can be estimated from the bright band signature of radar reflectivity. The horizontal rain structure is assumed to have a cellular form, called <b>rain</b> <b>cell.</b> <b>Rain</b> <b>cell</b> sizes can vary from a few hundred meters to several kilometers and {{dependent upon the}} rain type and location. Existence of very small size rain cells are recently observed in tropical rain.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} is {{proposed}} for the determination of effective <b>rain</b> <b>cell</b> dimensions and orientation. Two <b>rain</b> <b>cell</b> models were considered: the circular cell and the elliptical cell. In both models {{it is assumed that}} the rain rate is constant throughout the cell, that all cell locations are equally likely, and that the cell dimensions depend upon the rain rate. It is then shown that the effective cell dimensions and orientation may be deduced from rain rate statistics accumulated at two or three closely spaced sites, depending upon the model chosen. The results of this study alone with previous estimates of <b>rain</b> <b>cell</b> dimension indicate that the rain rate measurement points should be spaced on the order of one-half kilometer apart. The proposed method is simple and relatively inexpensive; thus, this approach is readily suited {{to the study of the}} dependence of <b>rain</b> <b>cell</b> size and orientation upon climatic region.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of electromagnetic waves {{through the atmosphere}} at frequencies above 10 GHz is strongly influenced by oxygen, water vapor, clouds and, most importantly, by rain. The scarcity of worldwide reliable rainfall data has pushed towards the development of models that could adequately reproduce real rain fields. This contribution presents a preliminary analysis of some spatial and temporal characteristics of <b>rain</b> <b>cells</b> for rainfall modeling purpose, based on weather radar images collected at the experimental station of Spino d’Adda. Specifically, the work investigates the spatial organization of <b>rain</b> <b>cells,</b> by taking into account their natural aggregative process into more extended structures, {{as well as the}} spatial distribution of such clusters on the map. The work also investigates the temporal evolution of real <b>rain</b> <b>cells.</b> A simple cell tracking algorithm is presented, which allows to examine the temporal variation of some fundamental descriptors of the <b>rain</b> <b>cells,</b> such as the area and average rain intensity. The trend of such descriptors is analyzed and modeled both separately and jointly.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} for time-space tracking of <b>rain</b> <b>cells</b> within <b>rain</b> field images obtained from weather radars.

40|$|In {{designing}} or {{planning for}} a microwave link, attenuation due to rain is often a major obstacle to overcome. Sometimes, a mitigation technique such as space diversity is also considered. However, a rain event occurring in an area is not constant. Rain does not distribute evenly in a region experiencing precipitation.

The analysis is performed using the rain reflectivity data base obtained at Wallops Island during June, July and August 1973 using a high resolution radar.

40|$|The {{ability of}} radar to scan a wide {{area around the}} radar site {{and not just a}} {{particular}} path made it a very attractive for many types of investigations. Radar can be used to measure the rainfall rate indirectly. This is achieved by knowing the radar reflectivity and then converting them into rainfall rate. The S-band frequency of the meteorological radar ensures that propagation effects such as attenuation are negligible. Radar provides valuable information that is relevant in modelling rain-induced propagation effects. Radar also provides spatially and temporally continuous measurements that are immediately available at one location. <b>Rain</b> <b>cell</b> size distribution is obtained from radar data. 'Virtual' microwave links of 20 -km path lengths were constructed in the scanning area of the radar. However, <b>rain</b> <b>cell</b> size distribution from radar data is limited to 1 -km integration size. This {{is due to the fact}} that the radar uses a range bin size of 1 km. The radar data is obtained from the Kluang Radar Station of the Meteorological Department of Malaysia.

However, as mentioned in this paper, if this step is omitted sensible estimates are still obtained for the Neyman-Scott model due to the fitting the smoothed rather than raw estimates.
