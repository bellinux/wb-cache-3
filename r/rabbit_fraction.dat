To {{better understand}} this function, the specificity of the rabbit liver aldehyde oxidase enzyme toward endogenous vitamins was quantitatively studied. Therefore, the present study showed the kinetic parameters of AO for the oxidation of vitamin B 6 and vitamin A were measured in partially purified <b>rabbit</b> liver <b>fraction.</b> Km values of AO endogenous vitamin were observed with pyridoxal (21  ±  6. 4  μM) and all-trans-retinal (46  ±  9. 1  μM) respectively for partially purified <b>rabbit</b> liver <b>fraction.</b> AO from <b>rabbit</b> liver <b>fraction</b> showed high Vmax with vitamin B 6 and vitamin A (1. 84  ±  0. 2 and 1. 28  ±  0. 1  nmol/min/mg protein, respectively). Therefore, the present study showed the kinetic parameters of AO for the oxidation of vitamin B 6 and vitamin A were measured in partially purified <b>rabbit</b> liver <b>fraction.</b> A high affinity and low Km values of AO endogenous vitamin were observed with pyridoxal (21  ±  6. 4  μM) and all-trans-retinal (46  ±  9. 1  μM), respectively for partially purified <b>rabbit</b> liver <b>fraction.</b> Pyridoxal and all-trans-retinal oxidized to their metabolites (25. 2  ±  12. 7 and 13. 3  ±  4. 1  nmol/min/mg protein, respectively) by partially purified rabbit liver aldehyde oxidase. These results confirmed that the hydrophobicity enhances affinity of pyridoxal and all-trans-retinal (aromatic aldehyde) toward AO as excellent substrates.

Suitable serological and general observations were made at appropriate intervals before and after each injection. All animals were sacrificed on the 22 nd day of the experiment. A study of the antemortem and pathological findings led to the following conclusions. 1. Allergie arteritis, valvulitis, {{and to a lesser}} degree, focal pericarditis, Aschoff-like nodules, and glomerulitis can be produced by several of the cold alcohol-precipitated fractions of horse serum as well as by whole serum. 2. Most of the acute arteritis was seen in <b>rabbits</b> receiving <b>fraction</b> V (albumin). These rabbits showed the largest amounts of circulating antigen, low antibody titers, low tissue sensitivity, and slight elevation in sedimentation rate and temperature. 3. There was a high incidence of chronic arteritis in the <b>rabbits</b> receiving <b>fraction</b> III which is almost devoid of albumin, suggesting that the alpha and beta globulins in addition to albumin may produce arteritis. 4. A state most nearly resembling that of acute rheumatic fever was produced by either fractions III or IV- 3, 4 (alpha and beta globulins). Pancarditis (pericarditis, Aschoff-like lesions, and valvulitis) was found relatively frequently. Many of the rabbits developed a high sedimentation rate, elevated temperature, and high tissue sensitivity, but little acute arteritis was found in this group. 5. Gamma globulin (fraction II) produced little reaction either in the antemortem determinations or histopathologically. 6.

40|$|Rabbit {{antithrombin}} III (AT), purified by heparin-agarose, {{was labeled}} with iodine- 131 {{by either the}} glucose oxidase-lactoperoxidase or iodine monochloride techniques. When intravenously injected, {{the disappearance of the}} 131 I-AT from plasma was characterized by rapid initial decreases, and three-exponential equations were required for best fit of the plasma disappearance curves. This rapid 131 I-AT removal was not caused by denaturation, as shown by comparison with results obtained when 131 I-AT was biologically screened (injected into a first rabbit, and then transferred 16 h later in whole plasma to a second for kinetic evaluation) before injection. Thus, the same rapid initial loss of plasma 131 I-AT was observed with screened preparations, and the plasma fractional catabolic rates of 0. 716 +/- 0. 048 and 0. 673 +/- 0. 051 day- 1 for unscreened and screened 131 I-AT were not significantly different. These results support the hypothesis that a vascular-endothelial AT compartment is present in <b>rabbit.</b> The <b>fractions</b> of the total-body AT in the plasma, the vascular-endothelial and the extravascular compartments were 0. 337 +/- 0. 031, 0. 178 +/- 0. 056, and 0. 485 +/- 0. 069, respectively. Two three-compartment kinetic models are discussed. The first pictures AT as distributing independently between plasma and two other compartments, and the second sees AT as first passing to the vascular-endothelial compartment, and then directly into the extravascular compartment. The plasma 131 I-AT kinetic data was consistent with both models, but the sizes of the vascular-endothelial compartments were best predicted by the second. If AT catabolism was assigned to the plasma, both models generally underpredicted the whole-body radioactivities, while assignment of breakdown to the extravascular compartment generally resulted in overpredictions. This suggests that AT catabolism occurs from both plasma and extravascular compartments...|$|R
40|$|An {{immunofluorescence}} {{study of}} adult rat muscle tissues with a polyclonal antibody against the RGD-directed fibronectin receptor of Friend's erythroleukemia cells (alpha 5 beta 1 -integrin) unexpectedly revealed {{a pattern of}} intracellular antigen distribution. Western blotting analysis of rat and <b>rabbit</b> membrane <b>fractions</b> indicated that the antibody recognizes a 167 -kDa protein expressed both in heart and in skeletal muscle (relative abundance: heart > slow muscle > fast muscle), but not in liver and kidney. The 167 -kDa protein did not show altered electrophoretic mobility upon reduction and failed to bind several lectins, including wheat germ agglutinin. A study of its subcellular distribution in rabbit skeletal muscle revealed that the 167 -kDa protein is mostly associated with the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and, to a smaller extent, with the sarcolemma, while it is absent in the longitudinal tubules of the SR. The 167 -kDa protein is not an integral membrane protein since it can be extracted at pH >/= 10. This protein can be proteolytically cleaved only {{in the presence of}} detergent, indicating that it resides on the luminal side of the SR. The 167 -kDa protein could be resolved from the closely spaced sarcalumenin and histidine-rich protein by column chromatography followed by detergent dialysis and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The N terminus and the internal sequences did not match any known sequence in protein and DNA data bases, indicating that the 167 -kDa protein is a novel muscle protein selectively localized to the SR. Integrins from rat kidney fibroblasts were not recognized by either (i) a polyclonal antiserum against the purified 167 -kDa protein or (ii) the anti-alpha 5 beta 1 -integrin antiserum after affinity purification onto the 167 -kDa protein. These data indicate that the 167 -kDa protein is not immunologically cross-reactive with integrins, despite its reaction with a polyclonal anti-integrin antibody...|$|R
40|$|Irradiation with u. v. {{light of}} aerobic aqueous media {{containing}} both <b>rabbit</b> liver microsomal <b>fraction</b> and 4 -chloroaniline results in N-oxidation of the arylamine. The reaction is severely blocked by exhaustive extraction with organic solvents of the microsomal membranes to remove lipids. Further, scavengers of OH. and O 2. -impair the photochemical process. These {{findings suggest that}} the observed phenomenon may be closely associated with light-induced lipid peroxidation. Indeed, N-oxidation of 4 -chloroaniline is fully preserved when either phospholipid liposomes or dispersed linoleic acid substitute for intact microsomal fraction. Co-oxidation of the amine substrate occurs during iron/ascorbate-promoted lipid peroxidation also, but H 2 O 2 or free OH. radicals {{do not appear to be}} involved. Cumene hydroperoxide-sustained rabbit liver microsomal turnover of the amine generates N-oxy product via O 2 -dependent and -independent pathways; propagation of lipid peroxidation is presumed to govern the former route. Lipid hydroperoxides, either exogenously added to rabbit liver microsomal suspensions or enzymically formed from arachidonic acid in ram seminal-vesicle microsomal preparations, support N-oxidation of 4 -chloroaniline. The significance, in arylamine activation, of lipid peroxidation in certain extrahepatic tissues exhibiting but low mono-oxygenase activity is discussed...|$|R
