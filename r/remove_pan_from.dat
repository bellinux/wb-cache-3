5000|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} {{as to the}} proper technique of hard-boiling an egg. One method is to bring {{water to a boil}} and cook for ten minutes. [...] Another method is to bring the water to a boil, but then <b>remove</b> the <b>pan</b> <b>from</b> the heat and allow eggs to cook in the gradually cooling water. Over-cooking eggs will typically result in a thin green iron(II) sulfide coating on the yolk. This reaction occurs more rapidly in older eggs as the whites are more alkaline.Immersing the egg in cold water after boiling is a common method of halting the cooking process to prevent this effect. It also causes a slight shrinking of the contents of the egg.|$|R

25|$|The {{intentions}} of the Republican Government to place in the Bank's management individuals loyal to the Republic were solidified through the Decree of August 4, 1936, which <b>removed</b> Pedro <b>Pan</b> Gómez <b>from</b> the office of First Deputy Governor in favour of Julio Carabias, a move which 10 days later {{was followed by the}} removal from office of various council members and high executives. After the transfer of gold to the Soviet Union on November 21, the modification of the General Council was decreed. The Council underwent new modifications until December 24, 1937, when nine council members were substituted for institutional representatives.|$|R

5000|$|Jared Diamond in The Third Chimpanzee (1991), and Morris Goodman (2003) [...] {{argued that}} Homo is not {{sufficiently}} <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>Pan</b> to warrant {{the definition of}} a separate genus.Based on the Principle of Priority, this would result in chimpanzees being reclassified as members of the Homo genus, e.g. Homo paniscus, Homo sylvestris, or Homo arboreus. An alternative philosophy suggests that the term Homo sapiens is the misnomer and that humans should be reclassified as Pan sapiens. In either case, a name change of the genus would have implications on the taxonomy of extinct species closely related to humans, including Australopithecus. A taxonomic name given to the species of the last common ancestors of humans and chimpanzees is Pan prior.|$|R
