5|$|While {{progressing}} {{through the}} game, the player can {{take control of}} three different characters: Juno, Vela, and Lupus. Each character has a special ability {{that allows them to}} uncover areas which the other characters cannot reach. Juno can walk through magma safely, Vela can swim underwater indefinitely, and Lupus can hover {{for a short period of}} time. Therefore, choosing the right character for the <b>right</b> <b>stage</b> is critical in order to complete the game. Initially, the game forces the player to use the three characters individually until they reach a meeting point. Once they reach the meeting point, all of the worlds can be tackled with any character in any order. The overall objective of the game is to explore all the galaxy to collect several starship parts and save a large number of survivors. The player can then use a starship and travel to the final stage.|$|E
25|$|Figs in {{the genus}} Ficus have a mutualistic {{arrangement}} with certain tiny agaonid wasps. In the common fig, the inflorescence is a syconium, formed by an enlarged, fleshy, hollow receptacle with multiple ovaries {{on the inner}} surface. A female wasp enters through a narrow aperture, fertilises these pistillate flowers and lays its eggs in some ovaries, with galls being formed by the developing larvae. In due course, staminate flowers develop inside the syconium. Wingless male wasps hatch and mate with females in the galls before tunnelling {{their way out of}} the developing fruit. The winged females, now laden with pollen, follow, flying off to find other receptive syconia at the <b>right</b> <b>stage</b> of development. Most species of fig have their own unique commensal species of wasp.|$|E
500|$|Fantasound, {{developed}} {{in part by}} Disney engineer William Garity, employed two projectors running at the same time. With one containing the picture film with a mono soundtrack for backup purposes, the other ran a sound film that was mixed from the eight tracks recorded at the Academy to four: three of which contained the audio for the left, center, and <b>right</b> <b>stage</b> speakers respectively, while the fourth became a control track with amplitude and frequency tones that drove variable-gain amplifiers to control {{the volume of the}} three audio tracks. In addition were three [...] "house" [...] speakers placed on the left, right, and center of the auditorium that derived from the left and <b>right</b> <b>stage</b> channels which acted as surround channels. As the original recording was captured at almost peak modulation to increase signal-to-noise ratio, the control track was used to restore the dynamics to where Stokowski thought they should be. For this, a tone-operated gain-adjusting device was built to control the levels of each of the three audio tracks through the amplifiers.|$|E

500|$|Barrymore {{began her}} film career in 1914 {{in a series}} of silent films, but she never {{dedicated}} herself to the medium fully. When opportunities for the <b>right</b> <b>stage</b> roles declined in the 1930s and she encountered financial difficulties, she appeared in her first talking film, Rasputin and the Empress (1932)—in which both her brothers also starred—and began radio broadcasts on the Blue Network with The Ethel Barrymore Theater. In the 1940s she had a last stage triumph in the long-running The Corn Is Green (1942), in which she had [...] "perhaps her most acclaimed role", according to her biographer, Benjamin McArthur. Her film work became increasingly prominent in the 1940s and 1950s, and she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for None but the Lonely Heart (1944). She received subsequent Academy Award nominations—again for Best Supporting Actress—for The Spiral Staircase (1946), The Paradine Case (1947) and Pinky (1949). She was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 8, 1960 and is, along with her two brothers, included in the American Theater Hall of Fame.|$|E
2500|$|The ancient Chinese {{found that}} salt, because it {{inhibits}} bacteria, was useful both in preserving foods and in controlling fermentation; without salt, the yeasts and sugars produced by vegetable decay would rot {{and turn to}} alcohol. From early times, pickles, sauces, and special dishes featured salt a main ingredient. Douchi, which {{was found in a}} tomb dated 165 BCE, is salted and fermented soy beans, the oldest food made from that product. Soy sauce, produced when the fermentation of the beans is controlled by salt at just the <b>right</b> <b>stage,</b> may have originated in the desire to make the supply of salt go farther. [...] Chinese vegetable pickles may be either fermented or marinated, most famously in Pao cai from cabbage, or Zha cai (pressed vegetable), also known as Sichuan vegetable.|$|E
60|$|One special object {{which the}} author of this series has had in view, in the plan and method which he has {{followed}} in the preparation of the successive volumes, has been to adapt them to the purposes of text-books in schools. The study of a general compend of history, such as is frequently used as a text-book, is highly useful, if it comes in at the <b>right</b> <b>stage</b> of education, when the mind is sufficiently matured, and has acquired sufficient preliminary knowledge to understand and appreciate so condensed a generalization as a summary of the whole history of a nation contained in an ordinary volume must necessarily be. Without this degree of maturity of mind, and this preparation, the study of such a work will be, as it too frequently is, a mere mechanical committing to memory of names, and dates, and phrases, which awaken no interest, communicate no ideas, and impart no useful knowledge to the mind.|$|E

6000|$|The {{phenomena}} {{of the year}} take place every day in a pond on a small scale. Every morning, generally speaking, the shallow water is being warmed more rapidly than the deep, though {{it may not be}} made so warm after all, and every evening it is being cooled more rapidly until the morning. The day is an epitome of the year. The night is the winter, the morning and evening are the spring and fall, and the noon is the summer. The cracking and booming of the ice indicate a change of temperature. One pleasant morning after a cold night, February 24th, 1850, having gone to Flint's Pond to spend the day, I noticed with surprise, that when I struck the ice with the head of my axe, it resounded like a gong for many rods around, or as if I had struck on a tight drum-head. The pond began to boom about an hour after sunrise, when it felt the influence of the sun's rays slanted upon it from over the hills; it stretched itself and yawned like a waking man with a gradually increasing tumult, which was kept up three or four hours. It took a short siesta at noon, and boomed once more toward night, as the sun was withdrawing his influence. In the <b>right</b> <b>stage</b> of the weather a pond fires its evening gun with great regularity. But {{in the middle of the}} day, being full of cracks, and the air also being less elastic, it had completely lost its resonance, and probably fishes and muskrats could not then have been stunned by a blow on it. The fishermen say that the [...] "thundering of the pond" [...] scares the fishes and prevents their biting. The pond does not thunder every evening, and I cannot tell surely when to expect its thundering; but though I may perceive no difference in the weather, it does. Who would have suspected so large and cold and thick-skinned a thing to be so sensitive? Yet it has its law to which it thunders obedience when it should as surely as the buds expand in the spring. The earth is all alive and covered with papillae. The largest pond is as sensitive to atmospheric changes as the globule of mercury in its tube.|$|E
50|$|In September 1998, {{a part of}} {{the organ}} (the <b>Right</b> <b>Stage</b> chamber) was {{restored}} to playable condition. Afterwards, a recording session took place, which captured the organ's record holders (the 64&prime; Diaphone-Dulzian, and the 100&Prime; Tuba Imperial and Grand Ophicleide). This was made possible by a $1.17 million grant from the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which was used to return the <b>Right</b> <b>Stage</b> Chamber of the Main Auditorium organ and the entire Ballroom (Kimball) Organ to playable condition.|$|E
50|$|When {{construction}} of the organ commenced, it was planned to have two 64-foot stops in the pedal, a Diaphone Profunda and a Dulzian. Later, the design was revised, and the Diaphone was cut, because it was feared it would crowd the <b>Right</b> <b>Stage</b> chamber (due to {{the width of the}} pipes). Consequently, the Dulzian was moved to the <b>Right</b> <b>Stage</b> chamber. However, the sound of the 64-foot Dulzian did not meet the criteria, requiring Diaphone pipes to be used for the lowest 22 notes. The remaining pipes in the rank are reeds. Because of the low frequencies involved, and because the diaphone is voiced to imitate a reed stop, the transition from reed to diaphone cannot be heard.|$|E
