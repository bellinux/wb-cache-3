5|$|Although Du Bois {{attended}} a New England Congregational {{church as a}} child, he abandoned organized religion while at Fisk College. As an adult, Du Bois described himself as agnostic or a freethinker, {{but at least one}} biographer concluded that Du Bois was virtually an atheist.Lewis, p. 550 (agnostic, atheist).Johnson, passim (agnostic). However, another analyst of Du Bois's writings concluded that he had a religious voice, albeit <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> other African-American religious voices of his era, and inaugurated a 20th-century spirituality to which Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, and James Baldwin also belong.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it is so}} {{far from}} the nearest major landmass, the {{ecosystem}} of Kohala has experienced the phenomenon of geographic isolation, resulting in an ecosystem <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> that of other places. Invasive species introduced by man present a problem to Kohala's ecosystem, as they push native species out of their habitat. There are several initiatives to preserve Kohala's ecosystem. Crops, especially sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), have been harvested on the Leeward side of the volcano for centuries as well. The northern part of the island is named after the mountain, with two districts named North and South Kohala. King Kamehameha I, the first King of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was born in North Kohala, near Hawi.|$|E

50|$|The film is {{the final}} story arc of the first Tenchi Muyo! {{television}} series, known outside Japan as Tenchi Universe. TMiL2 is also notable for its <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> tone <b>from</b> its source material.|$|R

5|$|Earth (1 AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is the largest}} and densest of the inner planets, the only one known to have current {{geological}} activity, and {{the only place where}} life is known to exist. Its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where plate tectonics has been observed. Earth's atmosphere is <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those of the other planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen. It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan {{wasted no}} time in organising his new ministry, taking several {{portfolios}} for himself, and again taking the position of Treasurer of South Australia. Deputy Premier Des Corcoran took on most infrastructure portfolios—Marine and Harbours, and Public Works. Corcoran became the face of the Dunstan ministry in its relationship with the Labor caucus, with his ability to use his strong manner to settle disputes. Bert Shard became Health Minister, overseeing the construction and planning of new, major public hospitals: the Flinders Medical Centre and Modbury Hospital. Hugh Hudson took on the Education portfolio, an important role in a government that was determined to bring about profound change to the South Australian education system. Geoff Virgo, the new Transport Minister, was to deal with the Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study (MATS) plans. Len King was made Attorney-General and Aboriginal Affairs Minister despite being a new member of parliament. Dunstan formed a strong circle of loyal ministers around him, in a style <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> his predecessors.|$|E
5|$|Hope is a Symbolist oil {{painting}} by the English painter George Frederic Watts, {{who completed the}} first two versions in 1886. <b>Radically</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> previous treatments of the subject, it shows a lone blindfolded female figure sitting on a globe, playing a lyre that has only a single string remaining. The background is almost blank, its only visible feature a single star. Watts intentionally used symbolism not traditionally associated with hope to make the painting's meaning ambiguous. While his use of colour in Hope was greatly admired, {{at the time of}} its exhibition many critics disliked the painting. Hope proved popular with the Aesthetic Movement, who considered beauty the primary purpose of art and were unconcerned by the ambiguity of its message. Reproductions in platinotype, and later cheap carbon prints, soon began to be sold.|$|E

5|$|In {{comparison}} to dogs, cats have not undergone major changes during the domestication process, as {{the form and}} behavior of the domestic cat is not <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those of wildcats and domestic cats are perfectly capable of surviving in the wild. Fully domesticated house cats often interbreed with feral F. catus populations, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat. This limited evolution during domestication means that hybridisation can occur with many other felids, notably the Asian leopard cat. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have predisposed them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play and relatively high intelligence. Several small felid species may have an inborn tendency towards tameness.|$|E
5|$|In 406 BC Alcibiades set {{out from}} Athens with 1,500 hoplites and a hundred ships. He failed to take Andros {{and then he went}} on to Samos. Later he moved to Notium, closer to the enemy at Ephesus. In the {{meanwhile}} Tissaphernes had been replaced by Cyrus the Younger (son of Darius II of Persia) who decided to financially support the Peloponnesians. This new revenue started to attract Athenian deserters to the Spartan navy. Additionally the Spartans had replaced Mindarus with Lysander, a very capable admiral. These factors caused the rapid growth of the Peloponnesian fleet {{at the expense of the}} Athenian. In search of funds and needing to force another decisive battle, Alcibiades left Notium and sailed to help Thrasybulus in the siege of Phocaea. Alcibiades was aware the Spartan fleet was nearby, so he left nearly eighty ships to watch them under the command of his personal helmsman Antiochus, who was given express orders not to attack. Antiochus disobeyed this single order and endeavored to draw Lysander into a fight by imitating the tactics used at Cyzicus. The situation at Notium, however, was <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> that at Cyzicus; the Athenians possessed no element of surprise, and Lysander had been well informed about their fleet by deserters. Antiochus's ship was sunk, and he was killed by a sudden Spartan attack; the remaining ships of the decoy force were then chased headlong back toward Notium, where the main Athenian force was caught unprepared by the sudden arrival of the whole Spartan fleet. In the ensuing fighting, Lysander gained an entire victory. Alcibiades soon returned and desperately tried to undo the defeat at Notium by scoring another victory, but Lysander could not be compelled to attack the fleet again.|$|E

25|$|This little-known {{project by}} New York {{architect}} William Lescaze introduced European Modernism to Texas in 1936.

25|$|One {{feature of}} the camp was that the wire fences were only two metres high; they were not electrified, {{and they did not}} have lookout towers filled with guards {{pointing}} their machine guns at the internees.

50|$|Because of its <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> nature <b>from</b> {{the usual}} {{games of the}} day, {{as well as its}} esoteric storyline, I, Robot {{received}} a poor reception on release. Approximately 750-1000 units of the game were created. Few have been confirmed to exist today. The arcade cabinets have since become rare collectibles with Dave Theurer's involvement being a selling point among collectors.|$|R
50|$|The album showcased a <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> sound <b>from</b> that {{to which}} Del Amitri fans had become used. With five years having elapsed since Some Other Sucker's Parade (1997), Can You Do Me Good? {{featured}} a new approach: drum loops, samples and synthesisers were the band's new tools. Though the songs retained their usual melodic characteristics, the overall impression {{was a very}} different one.|$|R
50|$|Mr Tompkins is {{the title}} {{character}} {{in a series of}} four popular science books by the physicist George Gamow. The books are structured as a series of dreams in which Mr Tompkins enters alternative worlds where the physical constants have <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> values <b>from</b> those they have in the real world. Gamow aims to use these alterations to explain modern scientific theories.|$|R
25|$|From the {{beginning}} of the movement, the free exchange of ideas among the people was fostered by the journals published by its leaders. Alexander Campbell published The Christian Baptist and The Millennial Harbinger. Barton W. Stone published The Christian Messenger. In a respectful way, both men routinely published the contributions of others whose positions were <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> their own.|$|E
25|$|Secret {{sessions}} were held on 14 to 17 December, {{and on the}} morning of 6 January, to keep the discord out of the press and the public arena. During the first of these, de Valera also produced his ideal redraft, which was not in most respects <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the signed agreement, but which was probably not acceptable to the British side as the differing points had already been explored.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, Smith {{made her}} only film appearance, {{starring}} in a two-reeler, St. Louis Blues, based on W. C. Handy's {{song of the}} same name. In the film, directed by Dudley Murphy and shot in Astoria, Queens, she sings the title song accompanied by members of Fletcher Henderson's orchestra, the Hall Johnson Choir, the pianist James P. Johnson and a string section—a musical environment <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> that of any of her recordings.|$|E
60|$|There remain {{two points}} to be {{considered}} concerning introspection. The first is as to how far it is trustworthy; the second is as to whether, even granting that it reveals no <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> STUFF <b>from</b> that revealed by {{what might be called}} external perception, it may not reveal different RELATIONS, and thus acquire almost as much importance as is traditionally assigned to it.|$|R

25|$|Palmer is also {{credited}} by {{many for}} securing {{the status of}} The Open Championship (British Open) among U.S. players. Before Ben Hogan won that championship in 1953, few American professionals had traveled to play in The Open, due to its extensive travel requirements, relatively small purse, and the style of its links courses (<b>radically</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> most American courses). Palmer wanted to emulate the feats of his predecessors Bobby Jones, Sam Snead and Hogan in his quest to become a leading American golfer.|$|E
25|$|Gordon's {{ideas on}} Sudan were <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Gladstone's: he {{believed}} that the Mahdi's rebellion had to be defeated, or he might gain control of the whole of Sudan, and from there sweep over Egypt. His fears were based on the Mahdi's claim to dominion over the entire Islamic world and on the fragility of the Egyptian army, which had suffered several defeats {{at the hands of the}} Sudanese. Gordon favoured an aggressive policy in Sudan, in agreement with noted imperialists such as Sir Samuel Baker and Sir Garnet Wolseley, and his opinions were published in The Times in January 1884.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} war, Mannerheim {{appointed}} Paasikivi prime minister. For {{the first time}} in Finland a Communist, Yrjö Leino, was included in the cabinet. Paasikivi's policies were those of a realist, <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those of the previous 25 years. His main effort was to prove that Finland would present no threat to the Soviet Union, and that both countries would gain from confident peaceful relations. He had to comply with many Soviet demands, including the war crimes trial. When Mannerheim resigned, Parliament selected Paasikivi to succeed him as President of the Republic. Paasikivi was then age 75.|$|E
50|$|Laing never {{denied the}} {{existence}} of mental illness, but viewed it in a <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> light <b>from</b> his contemporaries. For Laing, mental illness could be a transformative episode whereby the process of undergoing mental distress was compared to a shamanic journey.
