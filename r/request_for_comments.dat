5|$|The syntax {{of generic}} URIs and {{absolute}} URI references was first defined in <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Comments</b> (RFC) 2396, published in August 1998, and finalized in RFC 3986, published in January 2005.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} over {{defining}} URLs and URNs it became evident that the two concepts embodied by the terms were merely aspects of the fundamental, overarching notion of resource identification. In June 1994, the IETF published Berners-Lee's RFC 1630: the first <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Comments</b> that acknowledged the existence of URLs and URNs, and, more importantly, defined a formal syntax for Universal Resource Identifiers— URL-like strings whose precise syntaxes and semantics depended on their schemes. In addition, this RFC attempted to summarize the syntaxes of URL schemes in use at the time. It also acknowledged, but did not standardize, the existence of relative URLs and fragment identifiers.|$|E

25|$|After {{a year of}} {{planning}} and data collection, MDMA was proposed for scheduling by the DEA on 27 July 1984 with a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>comments</b> and objections. The DEA was surprised when a number of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and researchers objected to the proposed scheduling and requested a hearing. In a Newsweek article published the next year, a DEA pharmacologist stated that the agency had been unaware of its use among psychiatrists. An initial hearing was held on 1 February 1985 at the DEA offices in Washington, D.C. with administrative law judge Francis L. Young presiding. It was decided there to hold three more hearings that year: Los Angeles on 10 June, Kansas City, Missouri on 10–11 July, and Washington, D.C. on 8–11 October.|$|E
25|$|While the {{hardware}} {{components in the}} Internet infrastructure can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the standardization process of the software that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. Resulting contributions and standards are published as <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Comments</b> (RFC) documents on the IETF web site. The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the Internet Standards. Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Wall {{put forth}} a call for {{suggestions}} for {{a new version of}} Perl from the community. The process resulted in 361 RFC (<b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>comments)</b> documents that were to be used in guiding development of Perl 6. In 2001, work began on the [...] "Apocalypses" [...] for Perl 6, a series of documents meant to summarize the change requests and present the design of the next generation of Perl. They were presented as a digest of the RFCs, rather than a formal document. At this point, Perl 6 existed only as a description of a language.|$|E

500|$|Following this program, the Reflective Systems Unit at MDOT {{reviewed}} {{the state of}} two- and three-way concurrencies along the highway system in Michigan. They approached the department's Trunkline Numbering Committee and the district traffic and safety engineers on October 19, 1982, for proposals to reduce or eliminate the various overlapping designations to [...] "avoid driver confusion and save funds". [...] Included on the initial discussion report was the I-96/I-275 concurrency with a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>comments</b> by November 5 of that year. When the unit released its final recommendations on March 17, 1983, no changes were proposed regarding the I-96/I-275 concurrency. Other recommendations, such as removing US2 and US10 from overlaps with I-75 were implemented in later in 1983 and in 1985, respectively.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, the National Institute on Media and the Family {{criticized the}} ESRB for seldom-using the Adults Only rating {{because it has}} a vested {{interest}} in the video game industry, stating that [...] "study after study shows that ratings would be stricter if parents were doing the job. It took explicit porn to get [...] an AO rating, even though the original version, still rated M, rewards players whose on-screen persona had sex with prostitutes and then killed them. We have been calling for AO ratings for the Grand Theft Auto series for years—now it is clear why the ESRB has ignored our request." [...] The ESRB disputed these claims, arguing that the organization [...] "relies on flawed research and ignores any and all conflicting evidence", was [...] "imposing its own narrow values and morality {{on the rest of the}} country, regardless that it has little evidence to show that parents agree with their point of view", and did not reply to the ESRB's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>comments</b> following its report card in 2004. The board also pointed out that the NIMF's study and [...] "report card" [...] used data from PSVRatings, a for-profit competitor to the ESRB.|$|E

This process is important because ARPANET would eventually merge with other networks to form the Internet, {{and many of the}} communication protocols that the Internet relies upon today were specified through the <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Comment</b> process. In September 1981, RFC 791 introduced the Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and RFC 793 introduced the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) — thus creating the TCP/IP protocol that much of the Internet relies upon today.|$|R

2500|$|Steve Crocker (born 1944 in Pasadena, California) {{has worked}} in the ARPANET and Internet {{communities}} since their inception. As a UCLA graduate student in the 1960s, he helped create the ARPANET protocols which were the foundation for today's Internet. He created the <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Comments</b> series, authoring the very first RFC and many more. [...] He was instrumental in creating the ARPA [...] "Network Working Group", the forerunner of the modern Internet Engineering Task Force.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, the TCP managed both {{datagram}} transmissions and routing, but as {{the protocol}} grew, other researchers recommended a division of functionality into protocol layers. [...] Advocates included Jonathan Postel of the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute, who edited the <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Comments</b> (RFCs), the technical and strategic document series that has both documented and catalyzed Internet development. Postel stated, [...] "We are screwing up in our design of Internet protocols by violating the principle of layering." [...] Encapsulation of different mechanisms was intended {{to create an environment}} where the upper layers could access only what was needed from the lower layers. A monolithic design would be inflexible and lead to scalability issues. The Transmission Control Program was split into two distinct protocols, the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol.|$|E
