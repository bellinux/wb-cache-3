40|$|The Large Hadron Collider's superconducting magnets {{are cooled}} by {{superfluid}} helium at 1. 8 K and housed in cryostats that minimise the heat inleak to this temperature level by extracting heat at 70 and 5 K. In {{the first generation}} of prototype cryostats, the radiative heat to the 1. 8 K temperature level accounted for 70 % of the total heat inleak. An alternative to enhance the cryostat thermal performance incorporates a thermalised <b>radiation</b> <b>screen</b> at 5 K. In order to avoid contact between the 5 K <b>radiation</b> <b>screen</b> and the cold mass, insulators are placed between both surfaces. Sets of commercial fibre glass nets are insulator candidates to minimise the heat inleak caused by a accidental contact between the two temperature levels.

40|$|Laboratory-scale tests {{aimed at}} {{minimizing}} the thermal loads of the LHC magnet cryostat have {{gone along with}} the development of the various mechanical components. For final validation of the industrial design with respect to heat inleaks between large surfaces at different temperatures, a full-scale test cryostat has been constructed. The facility reproduces the same pattern of temperature levels as the LHC dipole cryostat, avoiding the heat inleaks from local components like supports and feedthroughs and carefully minimizing fringe effects due to the truncated geometry of the facility with respect to the LHC cryostats serial layout. Thermal loads to the actively cooled <b>radiation</b> <b>screen,</b> operated between 50 K and 65 K, are measured by enthalpy difference along its length. At 1. 9 K, the loads are obtained from the temperature difference across a superfluid helium exchanger. On the beam screen, the electrical power needed to stabilize the temperature at 20 K yields a direct reading of the heat losses. Precise in-situ calibration is achieved by subcooling the thermal screen, thereby zeroing radiative heat loads. Minimizing fringe effects has been rewarded by a high precision measurement, yielding one of the more accurate quantifications to date of an industrial application of MLI.

40|$|The LHC machine will {{incorporate}} some 2000 main ring super-conducting magnets cooled at 1. 9 K by super-fluid pressurized helium, mainly 15 m-long dipoles {{with their}} cryostats and 6 m-long quadrupoles {{housed in the}} Short Straight Section (SSS) units. This paper presents {{the design of the}} support system of the LHC arc cryo-magnets between 1. 9 K at the cold mass and 293 K at the cryostat vacuum vessel. The stringent positioning precision for magnet alignment and the high thermal performance for cryogenic efficiency are the main conflicting requirements, which have lead to a trade-off design. The systems retained for LHC are based on column-type supports positioned in the vertical plane of the magnets inside the cryostats. An ad-hoc design has been achieved both for cryo-dipoles and SSS. Each column is composed of a main tubular thin-walled structure in composite material (glass-fibre/epoxy resin, for its low thermal conductivity properties), interfaced to both magnet and cryostat via stainless steel flanges. The thermal performance of the support is improved by intercepting part of the conduction heat at two intermediate temperature levels (one at 50 - 75 K and the other at 4. 5 - 20 K). These intercepts, on the composite column, are thermally connected to the helium gas cooled thermal shield and <b>radiation</b> <b>screen</b> of the cryo-magnet.

40|$|This {{master s}} thesis {{continues}} the line of LNG related theses in cooperation with ComputIT AS. The Phoenix series large-scale LNG pool fire experiments have been simulated using the CFD software Kameleon FireEx (KFX) for validation purposes of the software to experimental data. A number of simulations were performed, and the main investigations of the experiment thermal radiation, pool spreading and flame morphology have been compared to results from KFX, using a range of different simulation scenarios. Scenarios included simulating the LNG as either a liquid release or as a gaseous release of methane from a circular equivalent of the quasi-steady LNG pool area obtained on the experiment. Other variations included transient or constant release, where the transient release {{was based on an}} approximated flow rate from the experiment, and the constant release was based on the average flow rate over the duration of the experiment. Due to limitations in the pool model in KFX, the liquid releases were simulated on a flat ground instead of on a pool of water, with various heat transfer coefficients to account for the heat transfer between the water and the LNG. The radiative heat fluxes from the simulations compared to experimental values were initially low by factors between two and four, regardless of simulation scenario. The soot model was investigated, and found to give an excess of relatively cold soot outside of the flame, acting as a <b>radiation</b> <b>screen,</b> thus reducing the thermal radiation from the fire to the surroundings. The soot model was modified, and subsequent simulations produced very comparable values for the radiative heat fluxes for the majority of simulation scenarios. For all liquid, transient simulations, the LNG pool spread much faster than in the experiment, and only the simulations with adiabatic conditions between the LNG and ground reached the same maximum area as the experiment. All simulations with non-adiabatic conditions had a maximum pool area below that of the experiment. As a result, it was concluded that the LNG vaporized too quickly, and consequently the duration of the fire was about 250 s shorter in the simulations than in the experiment. As a consequence of the high vaporization rate in the simulations, the flame grew to heights far above the experiment, and at some instances the flame in the simulations exceeded the flame height in the experiment of over 100 m. A new, simple model for LNG spreading through water was introduced, and initial computations in MATLAB produced highly promising results...|$|E
40|$|In many {{countries}} people typically spend over 90 {{percent of their}} time indoors. Therefore, the quality of the indoor environment has a big influence on the health and wellbeing of people. Standards for thermal comfort state that 80 percent of the occupants need to express satisfaction with the thermal environment to be thermally comfortable. Research from the Center of Built Environment however shows that only 11 percent of the office buildings reach this mark. The uniform indoor climate where the conventional HVAC system operates between 22 °C and 24 °C don’t meet the preferences of most occupants. At the same time is it very energy consuming to keep the indoor temperature between this deadband and can a lot of energy be saved widening this deadband. A possible solution can be the so called personal comfort system, where the dead band of the office is widened and the occupant can control their own thermal environment at the desk with heaters and fans. Results into these systems show an increased level of comfort and productivity. The problem is that these systems rely solely on active systems. Therefore, the research question is: How can additional passive techniques contribute to the thermal sensation of an occupant of an individual comfort system suitable for use in an open plan office spaces? As literature shows, thermal sensation and comfort is related to the heat balance of the human body. Physical aspects and the thermal regulation system of the human body influence the heat balance. At the same time there are psychological influences. The most important aspects are expectations and knowledge. These aspects were combined to create several conceptual solutions. Extended research into the use of a heat reflection screen to redirect the radiational heat loss of the human body back to the human body was done. Calculations and simulations then showed a promising result for a neck <b>radiation</b> <b>screen.</b> There {{are a lot of people}} that experience a cold thermal sensation at the neck. Placing a heat reflection screen can increase the skin temperature with approximatly 1 °C. Comparing these results with the just noticeable difference which is around 0. 5 °C for the neck this 1 °C difference will positively influence the thermal sensation of an occupant. Different materials were researched for their emissivity and reflectivity for far infrared radiation (wavelengths that the human body emits). However, these results came out inconclusive and need extended research. The gathered information was used to design a flexible heat reflection screen for the neck that can be applied to every office chair. The original conceptual ideas where used to design an evaporation panel for cooling that can be used in combination with fans that are normally used in personal comfort systems. It is suggested to also combine biorhythmic lighting with the settings for heating and cooling; providing cool light when feeling warm and warm light when feeling cold. Building Technolog...|$|E
