Gibbs's retirement opened up a seat that Republicans viewed as a pickup opportunity.|$|E

5|$|On January 26, 2009, Lieutenant Governor Daniel Mongiardo {{announced}} that he would seek the Democratic nomination to challenge incumbent Senator Jim Bunning in the 2010 senatorial election. The move effectively prohibited Mongiardo from <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> with Beshear in the 2011 gubernatorial contest.

He faced one opponent in the Democratic primary on August 26: lifelong Republican and Washington, D.C. resident H.

Paige was also unsuccessful in that effort, losing by 80% to 20%.|$|E

5|$|In June 2014, WKMS {{reported}} that Bevin had remained politically {{active in the}} aftermath of his defeat by McConnell, and an email to his followers calling on Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear, a Democrat, to denounce new carbon regulations issued by the EPA fueled speculation that Bevin would seek the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 2015. The station also cited an anonymous source that said Bevin would campaign for Rand Paul's Senate seat in 2016 if Paul's expected presidential bid kept him from <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election.</b> An August 2014 survey by Public Policy Polling showed that 25% of Republicans wanted Bevin to be the party's gubernatorial nominee, ahead of declared candidates James Comer (20%) and Hal Heiner (18%).|$|E
5|$|In October 2015, The Boston Globe first {{reported}} that Wolf was considering not <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election.</b> Weeks later in November, Wolf confirmed {{that he would}} remain in office, but would not seek re-election in 2016. Wolf's political aspirations were prodded shortly after handily winning re-election in 2014, though {{he said he was}} more focused on serving his constituents than considering future office. After rumors that Wolf would not seek re-election in 2016 in order to focus on a run for governor in 2018 began circulating, Senate President Stan Rosenberg suggested it was because Wolf wanted to focus more on running his airline company.|$|E
5|$|A Dainty Politician is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on corruption political activity during a political convention in which a corrupt politician is <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> to the United States Congress. The votes are tallied and the challenger ties with the corrupt Congressman Casey, but a third candidate holds the balance of power. Casey bribes the third candidate to retire in his favor, but the plot is uncovered and the two are ejected from the convention by a reporter {{who falls in love}} with challenger's daughter. The film was released on August 23, 1910, and saw a wide national release. Little is known of the actual production, but it received mixed reaction for the plausibility of its plot. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|In April 2011, Paul filed {{to run for}} {{re-election}} to his Senate seat in 2016. Had he become the Republican presidential (or vice-presidential) nominee, state law would prohibit him from simultaneously <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election.</b> In March 2014, the Republican-controlled Kentucky Senate passed {{a bill that would}} allow Paul to run for both offices, but the Democratic-controlled Kentucky House of Representatives declined to take it up. Paul spent his own campaign money in the 2014 legislative elections, helping Republican candidates for the State House in the hopes of flipping the chamber, thus allowing the legislature to pass the bill (Democratic Governor Steve Beshear's veto can be overridden with a simple majority). However, the Democrats retained their 54–46 majority in the State House. Paul has since given his support to the idea that the Kentucky Republican Party could decide to hold a caucus rather than a primary, potentially giving Paul more time to decide whether he should run for U.S. Senator or continue a potential bid for President.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{testified against}} Keating {{in a civil}} suit brought by Lincoln bondholders, and {{was seen as the}} plaintiffs' best witness. The other four {{senators}} refused to testify. Cranston left office in January 1993, and died in December 2000. DeConcini and Riegle continued to serve in the Senate until their terms expired, but they did not seek re-election in 1994. DeConcini was appointed by President Bill Clinton in February 1995 to the Board of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Glenn did choose to run for re-election in 1992, trying to become the first senator ever to win a fourth term from Ohio. The Republican candidate, Lieutenant Governor R. Michael DeWine, attacked Glenn on Keating Five {{as well as a number}} of other matters, in one of the dirtiest campaigns in the country that year and the toughest of Glenn's senatorial contests. Glenn prevailed, however, defeating DeWine by nine percentage points to gain one more term in the Senate before retiring and not <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-election</b> in 1998.|$|E
