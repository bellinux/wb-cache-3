40|$|Excerpt] As {{the large}} baby boomer {{generation}} retires, the workforce will lose {{much of their}} knowledge and experience. Encouraging <b>phased</b> <b>retirement,</b> in which older workers reduce their work hours with their current employer to transition into retirement, has been cited by retirement experts as one way to mitigate this loss. GAO was asked to review the work patterns of older Americans and <b>phased</b> <b>retirement</b> programs. In this report, GAO examines (1) recent trends {{in the labor force}} participation of older workers, (2) the extent to which employers have adopted <b>phased</b> <b>retirement</b> programs and what type of employers offer them, and (3) what challenges and benefits, if any, exist in designing and operating <b>phased</b> <b>retirement</b> programs. GAO analyzed data from two nationally representative surveys, the Health and Retirement Study (2004 - 2014) and the Current Population Survey (2005 - 2016); reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations; conducted a literature review; and interviewed 16 experts on retirement and 9 employers who offer or considered offering <b>phased</b> <b>retirement</b> programs.

40|$|We {{describe}} a simulated financial decision making task {{that requires the}} participant to make decisions, {{over the course of}} a life cycle, regarding how much of their income to consume immediately and how much to save for a later <b>retirement</b> <b>phase</b> in which no income will be generated. The savings task was developed to be readily understood and performed online by members of a diverse participant population. A preliminary study (N = 165) involving such a population was conducted in which performance on the savings task was observed as length of <b>retirement</b> <b>phase</b> and the presence of a consumption-smoothing goal were experimentally manipulated. Results suggested that most participants understood the task and responded sensibly; for example, they saved a greater portion of current income for later consumption when faced with a long, compared to a short, <b>retirement</b> <b>phase.</b> Responsiveness of saving levels during the task to retirement length was found to be correlated with an independent measure of participants' financial risk attitudes. Consumption smoothing during the task was found to be correlated with a measure of individual differences among participants in temporal delay discounting.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of reduced-crude protein (CP) and available phosphorus (aP) diets, added with phytase and amino acids for broilers in the growing (14 to 21 days old) and retirement (35 to 42 days) phases on nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus balance. Ninety Cobb broilers were distributed in a completely randomized design with three treatments and six replications with five and three birds per experimental unit in the growing and retirement phases, respectively. Diets were elaborated to contain reduced CP and aP levels (19 and 17 % CP in the growing phase, with 0. 34 % aP; and 18 and 16 % CP in the <b>retirement</b> <b>phase,</b> with 0. 30 % aP), supplemented with crystalline amino acids and 500 FTU of phytase/kg diet. These were compared to a control diet (21 % CP and 0. 46 % aP for growing phase and 19 % CP and 0. 40 % aP for <b>retirement</b> <b>phase).</b> The reduction of CP in four percentual units reduced the N excretion and increased the retention of this element, showing that the phytase had no influence on N balance when used the crystalline amino acids in the diets. The phytase reduced the P excretion and increased the retention ones. The potassium excretion decreased in reduced-CP diets, but this excessive reduction decreased the retention of this element, except in the <b>retirement</b> <b>phase.</b> It was concluded that the reduced-CP and aP diets, supplemented with phytase and amino acids, are efficient in reducing the pollutant power of the broilers excrements in the growing and retirement phases of production...|$|E

The numerical results show that the presence of health spending risk drives households to shift their portfolios from risky equities to safer assets and works to enhance the demand for annuities due to their increasing-with-age superiority over bonds as a hedge against life-contingent health spending as well as longevity risks. The safe and higher-return annuities in turn provide a greater leverage for equity investment in the remaining asset portfolios. This health-spending-uncertainty-enhanced optimal annuitization result is compatible with the broader theory about liquidity constraints and precautionary savings. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to assess the impacts of {{possible}} changes to the way Canadians retire. Banning mandatory <b>retirement</b> and <b>phased</b> <b>retirement</b> will {{be the focus of}} this paper. The large variation across retirement policies in North America provides ample evidence of the impacts of these changes. Below are some of the important results that the available evidence pointed to: • The age effect of banning mandatory retirement is usually small. The upward age effect is more significant for university faculty compared to the average worker but is still small in absolute terms. • Banning mandatory retirement will likely improve a department’s recruitment ability. The prediction that banning mandatory retirement will hurt the opportunities of young academics has not materialized in jurisdictions that have done so. • More productive professors choose to extend their careers past normal retirement age, while less productive professors rarely do so. • There is much debate on whether or not mandatory retirement is discrimination. Some believe it should remain a freely negotiated contractual agreement, while other point to inadequacies in provincial human rights codes which allow for age discrimination. • The age effect of a <b>phased</b> <b>retirement</b> plan is not large. Evidence suggests that those who choose <b>phased</b> <b>retirement</b> would have most likely continued to teach full-time without a <b>phased</b> <b>retirement</b> option. • The goal of <b>phased</b> <b>retirement</b> to keeping highly productive senior staff in the workforce longer is not achieved, though it does accelerate the rate which lower productivity academics leave the university setting. • From the empirical and theoretical evidence available, the benefits of both banning mandatory <b>retirement</b> and implementing <b>phased</b> <b>retirement</b> significantly outweigh the drawbacks. ...|$|R

40|$|Retirement as integrational task In this article, {{the stance}} is taken that {{retirement}} {{can be viewed}} as a critical life phase.

40|$|Various studies {{indicate}} that formal <b>phased</b> <b>retirement</b> programs within defined benefit plans are wanted and needed by both employers and employees. <b>Phased</b> <b>retirement</b> programs may be useful for employees who want to reduce their hours during later stages of their careers, but who wish {{to remain in the}} workforce. For employers, a <b>phased</b> <b>retirement</b> program may be a useful tool to retain talented employees who may otherwise fully retire.

30|$|<b>Phased</b> <b>retirement</b> is {{an often}} {{mentioned}} slogan in policy debates. This retirement option would allow workers {{to stay with}} their current employer, but with reduced hours and effort. From a socio-psychological point of view, <b>phased</b> <b>retirement</b> is meant to ease the often sudden change of life pace, allowing a more gradual reduction of responsibilities as well as stress; thus reducing pension shocks and allowing a more fulfilling end of a lifetime of work. On the other hand, <b>phased</b> <b>retirement</b> can help to preserve valuable firm-specific human capital in the workplace: While elderly workers might have trouble to compete with younger colleagues in terms of speed and physical fitness {{as well as in}} terms of the length of attention span or the ability to concentrate for longer periods (Skirbekk 2004), in other tasks like verbal or organizational skills elder workers are often better.

In this Introduction to the Special Issue: 2 ̆ 7 Reinventing Retirement: New Pathways, New Arrangements, New Meanings, 2 ̆ 7 we outline {{the historical development of}} retirement.

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{lifecycle}} model (LCM) of consumption over a random horizon (a. k. a. the Yaari model) {{to a world}} in which (i.) the force of mortality obeys a diffusion process as opposed to being deterministic, and (ii.) a consumer can adapt their consumption strategy to new information about their mortality rate (a. k. a. health status) as it becomes available. In particular, we derive the optimal consumption rate and focus on the impact of mortality rate uncertainty vs. simple lifetime uncertainty [...] assuming the actuarial survival curves are initially identical [...] in the <b>retirement</b> <b>phase</b> where this risk plays a greater role. In addition to deriving and numerically solving the PDE for the optimal consumption rate, our main general result is that when utility preferences are logarithmic the initial consumption rates are identical. But, in a CRRA framework in which the coefficient of relative risk aversion is greater (smaller) than one, the consumption rate is higher (lower) and a stochastic force of mortality does make a difference. That said, numerical experiments indicate that even for non-logarithmic preferences, the stochastic mortality effect is relatively minor from the individual's perspective. Our results should be relevant to researchers interested in calibrating the lifecycle model {{as well as those who}} provide normative guidance (a. k. a. financial advice) to retirees...|$|E
