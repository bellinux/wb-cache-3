40|$|This study aims to {{calculate}} indicators and indexes {{to subsidize the}} analysis of vulnerability and adaptation of the renewable energy sector to climate change in Brazil, focusing on biofuels and solar energy. For biofuels, in general, the Brazilian coast will be a propitious area for agricultural productivity during the XXI century, but these are areas historically intended for occupation {{and development of the}} urbanization process, that is, with limited land availability and supply for primary production. In some parts of the Northeast, Midwest and South of the country, offer for the cultivation land will be reduced. For the solar energy is observed that Brazil has area and highly expressive power for the use of this power, both today and in the coming decades, especial-ly in the North, Northeast and Midwest.

This figure corresponds to the relatively high level registered by the NRPB. Taking into account conditions in Georgia (geographic location and geophysical situation) this could be considered quite normal. An average RB indicator for buildings in Rustavi is 132 + 1. 56 nGy/h, slightly exceeding {{the same type of}} <b>radiation</b> <b>indicator</b> in European countries. According to the results a mean annual dose of external radiation of population (20 % from open spaces and 80 % from buildings) is 1. 04 + 0. 13 mZv/y.

On the basis of our data and the data obtained from the National Center of Oncology of the Ministry of Labor, Health and Social Security we have undertaken contraposition of oncological morbidity indicators of Rustavi population with radio-ecological situation in Rustavi. The results of the study demonstrate that the oncological morbidity indicators for Rustavi population (incidence, prevalence, mortality) in 2002 are lower than the same indicators for Tbilisi, despite the fact that in both cities (Rustavi, Tbilisi) the average annual dose of radiation population is exposed to is almost the same – 1. 04 and 1. 07 mZv/y (respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|It {{has proven}} {{impossible}} {{to create an}} indicator capable of showing {{the state of the}} art in a single figure so as to determine the progress made in the 'radiation component' of environmental policy from the trends indicated. This is the conclusion following an investigation requested by the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment in the framework of the environmental theme 'dispersion of radioactive substances and ionising radiation' to develop a <b>radiation</b> <b>indicator</b> comparable to the indicators for proprietary substances and pesticides. The most important reasons for failing to develop this indicator lie in the absence of both suitable policy targets and data for the calculations necessary for the indicator. Substituting policy targets with reference emissions, reference concentrations and reference doses would make it possible to define indicators for radiation protection. Here, environmental pressure indicators are proposed for nuclear installations and the process industry. The environmental quality indicator for radioactive substances in surface waters and suspended matter needs additional investigation. An environmental quality indicator is both possible and desirable for radium in dredged material, although no policy targets are available. However, for the time being construction of an environmental quality indicator for radon and external radiation in dwellings is impossible. Use of the population-averaged dose as an environmental effect indicator is recommended. If only one policy theme indicator for radiation is needed, the preferred choice is the environmental pressure indicator. The reference emission should be derived from the 'secondary (dose) level'. Priority is no longer given by the authorities to the optimalisation of radiation protection, defined in the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle, below this secondary level...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{properties}} and dynamics of self-gravitating bosonic objects in Einstein gravity was conducted. We studied self-coupled boson stars and determined the quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies of stable boson stars in spherical symmetry. The study {{was carried out in}} the standard Einstein theory of General Relativity and in Brans-Dicke theory. We also studied the formation of these objects in Brans-Dicke theory showing that they can form from the self-gravitation of bosonic matter. We also studied the studied the possibility of a bosonic halo surrounding galaxies. After an extensive study in spherical symmetry we carried out numerical studies of boson star dynamics in full 3 + 1 dimension. One focus of the 3 D study was on the validation of the numerical code constructed to solve Einstein equations with matter sources. Boson Stars do not suffer from the surface problems of neutron stars or the singularities of black holes. The code was first tested with spherical perturbations and compared with the spherical results. We determined the coordinate conditions needed to provide stable evolutions. We then went on to study their behavior under non-spherical perturbations. We reproduced the QNM frequencies of the stars, as determined by perturbation studies carried out by other groups. The energy generated by the perturbation was studied with different <b>radiation</b> <b>indicators.</b> We also observed the collapse to black holes of unstable boson-star configurations. We simulated the collision of two boson stars. This is of interest as the two body problem is as yet unresolved in general relativity.

40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at the {{hygienic}} assessment {{of the sources of}} utility and drinking water for the Khakasia population regarding <b>radiation</b> protection <b>indicators.</b> The results. Annually over 50 % of studied water samples of the utility and drinking water sources for the republic’s population do not comply with the regulatory requirements on specific total alpha –activity (Aa). This value in the samples varies from 0. 03 to  5 Bq/kg. Water samples of utility and drinking water supply sources with the exceedance of limit levels on Alfa – activity were pinpointed in Sorsk, Prigorsk, Verhnyaya Sogra water intake (Abakan), Ordzhonikidze, Shirinsk, Bogradsk, Ust’ –Abakan, Altaisk, Beisk, Toshtypsk, Askizsk districts of the republic. For Betaactivity the exceedances of limit levels were not found. High alpha-activity levels are attributed to the natural radionuclides 238 U and 234 U. On the annual basis water samples from utility and drinking water supply sources display the growing amount of intervention level exceedances on 222 Rn. The radon- 222 specific activity in the samples varies from 6. 0 to 170 Bq/kg. The ratio of the sum of natural radionuclides’ specific activities’ ratios to the corresponding intervention levels is below 1. 0 in Ordzhenikidzevsk, Bogradsk, Ust’-Abakan, Shirinsk, Toshtypsk, Askizsk districts, Sorsk town, Prigorsk township, Verkhnaya Sogra water intake (Abakan). This means that radiological protection measures are not necessary for those territories in present time. In Beisk and Altaisk districts of the republic, the sum of natural radionuclides’ specific activities’ ratios to the corresponding intervention levels is above 1. 0 (the values are in the range of 1. 02 – 1. 2). The average annual individual effective doses for population internal exposure from drinking water natural radionuclides in Khakasia Republic exceed twofold the average levels across Russia. In Beisk and Altaisk districts, the average annual effective dose to the population is in the range from 0. 01 to 0. 12 mSv/year which exceeds 0. 1 mSv/year. In the other administrative districts of the republic, the value is between 0. 01 and 0. 094 mSv/year.

The article analyses radiation-hygienic requirements for packaged drinking water in the regulatory documents of the Customs Union and the Eurasian Economic Union. It is shown that the methodology for regulation of radiation safety of drinking water in the RSS- 99 / 2009 and the “Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality” of the World Health Organization are practically identical. However, the direct application of the similar approach to the regulation of <b>radiation</b> safety <b>indicators</b> of packaged water is associated with significant difficulties, which in some degree are related to the lack of established classification of packaged drinking water.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a combined model and laboratory {{investigation of the}} generation and mutual interactions of fluid waves whose characteristic scales differ by {{an order of magnitude}} or more. The principal aims are to study how waves on one scale can generate waves on another, much shorter scale, and to examine the subsequent nonlinear feedback of the short waves on the long waves. The underlying motive is to better understand such interactions in rotating, stratified, planetary fluids such as atmospheres and oceans. The first part of the thesis {{describes a}} laboratory investigation using a rotating, two-layer annulus, forced by imposing a shear across the interface between the layers. A method is developed for making measurements of the two-dimensional interface height field which are very highly-resolved both in space and time. The system's linear normal modes fall into two distinct classes: 'slow' waves which are relatively long in wavelength and intrinsic period, and 'fast' waves which are much shorter and more quickly-evolving. Experiments are performed to categorize the flow at a wide range of points in the system's parameter space. At very small background rotation rates, the interface is completely devoid of waves of both types. At higher rates, fast modes only are generated, and are shown to be consistent with the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability mechanism based on a critical Richardson number. At rotation rates which are higher still, baroclinic instability gives rise to the onset of slow modes, with subsequent localized generation of fast modes superimposed in the troughs of the slow waves. In order to examine the generation mechanism of these coexisting fast modes, and to assess the extent of their impact upon the evolution of the slow modes, a quasi-geostrophic numerical model of the laboratory annulus is developed {{in the second part of}} the thesis. Fast modes are filtered out of the model by construction, as the phase space trajectory is confined to the slow manifold, but the slow wave dynamics is accurately captured. Model velocity fields are used to diagnose a number of fast wave <b>radiation</b> <b>indicators.</b> In contrast to the case of isolated fast waves, the Richardson number is a poor indicator of the generation of the coexisting fast waves that are observed in the laboratory, and so it is inferred that these are not Kelvin-Helmholtz waves. The best indicator is one associated with the spontaneous emission of inertia-gravity waves, a generalization of geostrophic adjustment radiation. A comparison is carried out between the equilibrated wavenumbers, phase speeds and amplitudes of slow waves in the laboratory (which coexist with fast modes), and slow waves in the model (which exist alone). There are significant differences between these wave properties, but it is shown that these discrepancies can be attributed to uncertainties in fluid properties, and to model approximations apart from the neglect of fast modes. The impact of the fast modes on the slow modes is therefore sufficiently small to evade illumination by this method of inquiry. As a stronger test of the interaction, a stochastic parameterization of the inertia-gravity waves is included in the model. Consistent with the laboratory/model intercomparison, the parameterized fast waves generally have only a small impact upon the slow waves. However, sufficiently close to a transition curve between two different slow modes in the system's parameter space, it is shown that the fast modes can exert a dominant influence. In particular, the fast modes can force spontaneous transitions from one slow mode to another, due to the phenomenon of stochastic resonance. This finding should be of interest to the meteorological and climate modelling communities, because of its potential to affect model reliability.

40|$|In {{the event}} of a radionuclear attack or nuclear accident, the skin would be the first barrier exposed to radiation, though skin injury can {{progress}} over days to years following exposure. Chronic oxidative stress has been implicated as being a potential contributor to the progression of delayed radiation–induced injury to skin and other organs. To examine the causative role of oxidative stress in delayed radiation–induced skin injury, including impaired wound healing, we tested a synthetic superoxide dismutase (SOD) /catalase mimetic, EUK- 207, in a rat model of combined skin irradiation and wound injury. Administered systemically, beginning 48 hours after irradiation, EUK- 207 mitigated <b>radiation</b> dermatitis, suppressed <b>indicators</b> of tissue oxidative stress, and enhanced wound healing. Evaluation of gene expression in irradiated skin at 30 days after exposure revealed a significant upregulation of several key genes involved in detoxication of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.

These results demonstrate that oxidative stress has a critical role in the progression of radiation-induced skin injury, and that the injury can be mitigated by appropriate antioxidant compounds administered 48 hours after exposure...|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{radiation}} significantly influences many biological entities in {{the terrestrial}} biosphere. However, {{the amount of}} UV exposure can be affected by surfaces that reflect UV radiation. Knowledge about reflected UV radiation from surfaces in the built environment is limited, especially from vertical or other non-horizontal surfaces and the resulting effects of UV radiation reflection from these surfaces. The main aims {{of this research is}} comprised of (1) characterisation of UV radiation reflection from a variety of urban building materials in vertical positions, (2) quantification of the biological effect of UV reflection from simulated structures on a human and (3) establishing relationships between UV <b>radiation</b> measurement <b>indicators</b> and resulting biological effects. UV radiation reflection was investigated using spectral measurements made with portable spectrometers, and took into consideration factors that could influence the measurements including orientation, direction, solar zenith and azimuth angles and surface type. The biological effects due to reflection from vertical urban structures were investigated using dosimetry which enabled body site UV exposure analysis. Relationships from UV radiation reflection between different surface orientations (vertical, horizontal and inclined) were quantified. The UV Index was used to predict changes to UV exposure from certain vertical UV radiation reflective surfaces. Spectral reflection from vertical urban structures was found to be variable and for metallic surface types the variation appears to be predominantly controlled by solar zenith and solar azimuth angles, with man-made surfaces reflecting some radiation specularly. Hence, surface type and the coating on the surface type dictates the way UV radiation is reflected from a surface. Increases in UV exposure are observed during seasons with larger solar zenith angles, and decreases in seasons with predominantly lower solar zenith angles. This produces an observable seasonal effect, creating a potential problem in cooler seasons than in warmer seasons due to human behaviour, where personal UV protection can be overlooked compared to thermal comfort. This study has shown that UV reflection from certain vertical surfaces will substantially enhance UV exposure to an individual, and reduce the time for an outdoor worker to exceed recommended UV exposure limits...|$|R

In addition, performance indicators are widely used by regulatory authorities although the use is not harmonised. Two basic performance indicators related to good radiation protection practice are collective radiation exposure and volume of low-level radioactive waste. In 2000, Nuclear Power Plant Krško, a Westinghouse pressurised water reactor with electrical output 700 MW, finished an extensive modernisation including the replacement of both steam generators. While the annual volume of low-level radioactive waste does not show a specific trend related to modernisation, the annual collective dose reached maximum, i. e. 2. 60 man Sv, and dropped to 1. 13 man Sv in 2001. During the replacement of the steam generators in 2000, the dose associated with this activity was 1. 48 man Sv.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{compares the}} {{dosimetry}} {{and efficiency of}} two modern radiosurgery (SRS) modalities for multiple brain metastases (Gamma Knife and LINAC-based RapidArc/volumetric modulated arc therapy), with a special focus on the comparison of low dose spread. Methods: Six patients {{with three or four}} small brain metastases were used in this study. The size of targets varied from 0. 1 ~ 10. 5 cc. SRS doses were prescribed according to size of lesions. SRS plans were made using both Gamma Knife® Perfexion and a single-isocenter, multiple non-coplanar RapidArc®. Dosimetric parameters analyzed included RTOG conformity index (CI), gradient index (GI), 12 Gy isodose volume (V 12 Gy) for each target, and the dose spread (Dspread) for each plan. Dspread reflects SRS plan’s capability of confining radiation to within the local vicinity of the lesion and to not spread out to the surrounding normal brain tissues. Each plan has a dose (Dspread), such that once dose decreases below Dspread (on total tissue DVH), isodose volume starts increasing dramatically. Dspread is defined as that dose when volume increase first exceeds 20 cc per 0. 1 Gy dose decrease. Results: RapidArc SRS has smaller CI (1. 19 ± 0. 14 vs. 1. 50 ± 0. 16, p< 0. 001) and larger GI (4. 77 ± 1. 49 vs. 3. 65 ± 0. 98, p < 0. 01). V 12 Gy results were comparable (2. 73 ± 1. 38 cc vs. 3. 06 ± 2. 20 cc, p = 0. 58). Moderate to lower dose spread, V 6, V 4. 5, and V 3, were also equivalent. Gamma Knife plans achieved better very low dose spread (≤ 3 Gy) and also had slightly smaller Dspread, 1. 9 Gy vs 2. 5 Gy. Total treatment time for Gamma Knife is estimated between 60 ~ 100 min. Gamma Knife treatments are between 3 ~ 5 times longer compared to RapidArc treatment techniques. Conclusion: Dosimetric parameters reflecting prescription dose conformality (CI), dose fall off (GI), <b>radiation</b> necrosis <b>indicator</b> (V 12 Gy), and dose spread (Dspread) were compared between Gamma Knife SRS and RapidArc SRS for multi-mets.

40|$|In {{the last}} twenty years many methods of cardiac output {{determination}} have been developed such as the Ballistocardiograph by Henderson and later by Cournand, pulse and blood pressure techniques employed by Bazett and associates, magnetic procedures and lately ferromagnetic resonance techniques have been tried. Most of these methods, however, either have severe operational disadvantages or are still in experimental states. Of course, efforts to determine cardiac output would be fruitless if its determinations were of no practical importance. However, much valuable information is given by a knowledge of cardiac output and blood transit time through the heart and lungs. At present a surgeon or physician can have the blood pressure, pulse and electrocardiogram continuously available to him during surgery or diagnostic work. If {{at the same time the}} cardiac output were available, its correlation with the above information would give a much clearer picture of the condition and reactions of the cardiovascular system. It is therefore obvious that the determination of cardiac output is not only of general interest but is of considerable importance in medical practice. To date, the most clinically adaptable method appears to be that using the indicator dilution technique. This method depends upon two important considerations. The indicator that is used must be non-toxic, even in large doses. The unit used for the detection of the dilution must be sensitive only to that indicator. The indicator may be either a chemical dye and the recording apparatus a densitometer, or an isotope with the detecting unit being a <b>radiation</b> monitor. <b>Indicator</b> dilution curves depend for their validity upon satisfactory and complete mixing of the dye with the blood. In addition, it is assumed that the densitometer samples a representative portion of that blood. Recent work (17) has shown that the indicator dilution technique for cardiac output determination has many advantages over the other methods mentioned above. This method allows the determination of cardiac output on severely ill patients. It is also possible to make repeated measurements, and in addition this method allows the determination of other important cardiovascular indices. However, a technician must spend between 30 and 60 minutes analysing each curve before all the answers are available. Thus, while this technique has many advantages, this time factor is one criticism. It was therefore thought desirable to design a computer which would allow the rapid determination of these important cardiopulmonary variables. Such a computer should be technically and operationally as simple as possible and should have an accuracy consistent with the accuracy of the method of determination.

40|$|Skin {{cancer is}} an {{emerging}} {{public health problem}} in Sweden. Even though the most important risk factor {{for the development of}} skin cancer - sun exposure - is known, the incidence of skin cancer is still increasing. Every year approximately 30, 000 people in Sweden are diagnosed with skin cancer and approximately 400 die of this condition. In addition to the deaths and suffering caused by skin cancer, its treatment incurs considerable health costs. The aim of this thesis was to examine factors relevant to sun-related behaviours and early detection of malignant skin lesions. The preventive effects of two information strategies on sun-related behaviours and early detection of malignant melanoma were also studied. Three samples were studied with questionnaires, these were: 52 female nurses attending a postgraduate course in research methodology at the Karolinska Institutet, 2, 615 adolescents (13, 15 and 17 year of age) randomly selected from the population in Sweden, and 1, 743 adults (18 - 37 year of age) randomly selected from the population in Stockholm County. The first sample completed the questionnaires in connection to lectures, whereas the other two responded to mailed questionnaires. Further, 90 patients recruited from the Karolinska hospital and 30 randomly selected persons from Stockholm County (18 to 79 year of age) participated in an interview study. The results showed that the questionnaires commonly used to measure sun-related behaviours had sufficient reliability. The studies confirm previous findings that adolescents and adults in Sweden {{spend a lot of time}} in the sun, frequently with the intention of becoming tanned, and frequently become sunburnt. The studies also highlighted variables associated with sun-related behaviour. Knowledge about skin cancer was not associated with decreased sunbathing or increased sun protection behaviour among adolescents. In fact, high knowledge was positively related to frequent sunbathing. Positive attitudes towards sunbathing and having a tan were strongly related to exposure to solar radiation. Being around people who frequently sunbathe was related to intentional tanning and vacation to sunny resorts. To perceive sun exposure as risky increased the likelihood of intending to decrease sunbathing and undertake sun protection behaviour. Perceived control over the risks with sun exposure was associated with sun protection behaviour among women. An individual ultraviolet (UV) <b>radiation</b> intensity <b>indicator</b> and information about the UV index (a measure of the intensity of solar radiation) did not affect sun-related behaviour more than general written information about sun protection. Health care providers seem to play an important role in early detection of malignant melanoma, as more than 1 / 3 of the melanoma patients interviewed said that their melanoma was detected at a visit to a physician for another reason. The ABCD criteria (a description of the characteristics of early melanoma) seem to increase laymen's ability to make adequate judgements of skin lesions and could be used in secondary preventive interventions. The results of the present thesis contribute to the understanding of factors relevant to sunrelated behaviours. Taking these factors into account when planning skin cancer prevention activities may improve the effectiveness of these efforts...|$|R
40|$|Many {{infectious}} bacterial and viral agents {{exist in}} the world and are located in areas where humans may come into contact with them. Food, water, and environmental locations may be contaminated with infectious material, and detecting the presence of these harmful biologic agents is of import to public health agencies. One method that has been used to determine if infectious agents may be present in food or water is measurement of "indicator" bacteria or viruses. Indicator organisms are easily measured bacteria or viruses whose presence in water or food is thought to parallel the potential presence of infectious agents in the same food or water samples. Because there are so many potential bacteria (or viruses) that may infect a sample, it is impractical to test for all of them; rather, measurement of a single indicator organism may be more feasible. Indicator bacteria have been used to determine if marine waters at beaches across the United States are safe for swimming. Guidelines issued by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. EPA) have focused on determining when recreational waters may pose a risk of excess gastrointestinal illness among swimmers when compared to non-swimmers. However, marine environments are very complex, and tidal patterns, solar inactivation, water temperature, and many other factors all can influence {{the presence or absence of}} indicator and infectious microorganisms in the water. Research has indicated that indicator organisms may be useful in predicting gastrointestinal illness in marine environments, but other health outcomes have been less studied. In order to verify that indicator organisms do track well with infectious organisms, a systematic review and meta analysis was conducted to determine if indicator organisms can predict a different health outcome, skin infection. Once the link between indicator organisms and health outcomes was established, the next goal was to explore different methods to strengthen the relationship between indicator organisms and health. Currently, the U. S. EPA advises that a single bacterial indicator, Enterococcus, be measured in marine waters. A binary cutoff of above or below 104 colony forming units per 100 mL is used to advise whether a beach is unsafe or safe for swimming. In order to improve prediction of illness at beaches using indicator organisms, several methods were considered. Flexible statistical modeling techniques, such as SuperLearning, were used, as well as consideration of multiple biological and physical indicators at the same time. The final aim was to examine the potential sources of the infectious agents, as well as the indicator bacteria, at Avalon beach in Southern California. The results of this investigation suggest that indicator bacteria can be quite useful in predicting human illness, but perform better under certain conditions. The systematic review and meta-analysis showed that there was a strong relationship between certain indicator organisms and skin infections in marine water settings. Higher concentrations of total coliform, fecal coliform, E. coli, Enterococcus, and fecal Streptococci were associated with increased risk of skin related illness in marine waters. These findings support the biological plausibility of using indicator organisms to predict illness, even in a complicated, dynamic environment such as a marine beach. The second investigation found that application of the U. S. EPA guidelines at Avalon Beach did not accurately predict when waters were unsafe for swimming. However, use of flexible statistical methods (SuperLearner) greatly improved prediction of gastrointestinal illness over traditional modeling methods, such as logistic regression. Further improvements were seen when, instead of using a single indicator organism, combinations of biological and physical indicators were used. By combining physical and biological indicators, it was possible to identify circumstances when elevated concentrations of Enterococcus predicted excess gastrointestinal illness in swimmers. When solar radiation levels were low, indicator bacteria concentrations were more strongly associated with adverse health outcomes, whereas higher solar radiation levels were protective. This finding is biologically plausible because it is thought that solar radiation can directly damage indicator bacteria as well as pathogens and render them non-viable. Thus, under high solar <b>radiation</b> conditions, <b>indicator</b> organisms as well as infectious organisms would be inactivated. The final analysis examined groundwater flow as a potential risk to swimmers at Avalon beach. Because of a leaking sewage infrastructure at Avalon, it is thought that groundwater flux might be transporting raw sewage contents into the ocean water. Sewage is known to carry potentially high levels of pathogenic organisms, and thus groundwater flow levels might pose a direct threat to swimmers. When groundwater flow was higher, the incidence of gastrointestinal illness was elevated among swimmers who swallowed water, relative to swimmers who swallowed water on days when groundwater flow was lower. Additionally, the relationship between groundwater flow and solar radiation was similar to that seen with Enterococcus and solar radiation. When solar radiation levels were high, groundwater flow was less predictive of excess gastrointestinal illness, as would be expected. When traditional analysis methods were used to relate traditional and rapid indicators to illness, relationships were much stronger when groundwater flow was high versus when groundwater flow levels were lower. In conclusion, the results of these analyses suggest that indicator organisms can be used to predict health outcomes in recreational water settings, but that their performance may be greatly improved by using flexible modeling techniques as well as other indicators, such as solar radiation...|$|R
