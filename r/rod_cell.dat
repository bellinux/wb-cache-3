5|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total <b>rod</b> <b>cell</b> color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases. This increases {{the damage done by}} recessive deleterious mutations, in a process known as inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, in a process of background selection. For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced {{as a consequence of the}} bottleneck, due to genetic purging.This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{symptoms}} of incomplete achromatopsia {{are similar to}} those of complete achromatopsia except in a diminished form. Individuals with incomplete achromatopsia have reduced visual acuity with or without nystagmus or photophobia. Furthermore, these individuals show only partial impairment of cone cell function but again have retained <b>rod</b> <b>cell</b> function.|$|E
25|$|Here, protein domains act as modules, {{each with}} a {{particular}} and independent function, that can be mixed together to produce genes encoding new proteins with novel properties. For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for cone cell or color vision and one for <b>rod</b> <b>cell</b> or night vision; all four arose from a single ancestral gene. Another advantage of duplicating a gene (or even an entire genome) is that this increases engineering redundancy; this allows one gene in the pair to acquire a new function while the other copy performs the original function. Other types of mutation occasionally create new genes from previously noncoding DNA.|$|E
5000|$|The {{photopigment}} {{found in}} <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> is called rhodopsin. [...] Upon {{the absorption of}} light <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> becomes bleached causing rhodopsin to lose all of its colour and become transparent. [...] During dark adaptation the <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> regenerate and the rhodopsin regains its purple pigmentation rendering them capable of capturing light.|$|R
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{photoreceptor}} <b>cells,</b> <b>rods</b> and cones, which are sensitive to different aspects of light. <b>Rod</b> <b>cells</b> are sensitive to the intensity of light over a wide frequency range, thus are responsible for black-and-white vision. <b>Rod</b> <b>cells</b> are not present on the fovea, the area of the retina responsible for central vision, and are not as responsive as cone cells to spatial and temporal changes in light. There are, however, twenty times more <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> than cone cells in the retina because the <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> are present across a wider area. Because of their wider distribution, rods are responsible for peripheral vision.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{controllable}} light delivery to retinal <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> using an optical fiber is described. Photo-induced current {{of the living}} <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> was measured with the suction electrode technique.

In addition, the ion current responses of <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> to polarized light at two different orientation geometries of the cells were studied. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
50|$|Activation of photopigments {{by light}} sends a signal by hyperpolarizing the <b>rod</b> <b>cell,</b> {{leading to the}} <b>rod</b> <b>cell</b> not sending its neurotransmitter, {{which leads to the}} bipolar cell then {{releasing}} its transmitter at the bipolar-ganglion synapse and exciting the synapse.|$|E

50|$|The {{importance}} and versatility of depolarization within cells {{can be seen}} in the relationship between rod cells in the eye and their associated neurons. When rod cells are in the dark, they are depolarized. In the rod cells, this depolarization is maintained by ion channels that remain open due to the higher voltage of the <b>rod</b> <b>cell</b> in the depolarized state. The ion channels allow calcium and sodium to pass freely into the cell, maintaining the depolarized state. Rod cells in the depolarized state constantly release neurotransmitters which in turn stimulate the nerves associated with rod cells. This cycle is broken when rod cells are exposed to light; the absorption of light by the <b>rod</b> <b>cell</b> causes the channels that had facilitated the entry of sodium and calcium into the <b>rod</b> <b>cell</b> to close. When these channels close, the <b>rod</b> <b>cell</b> produces less neurotransmitter, which is perceived by the brain as light. In the case of rod cells and neurons, depolarization actually prevents a signal from reaching the brain as opposed to stimulating the transmission of the signal.|$|E
40|$|The {{absorption}} of light by the photoreceptor {{cells in the}} retina initiates the processes of visual perception. There {{are two types of}} receptor <b>cells,</b> the <b>rod</b> <b>cells,</b> which are responsible for vision in dim light, "night vision", and the cone cells, which are responsible for color vision. <b>Rod</b> and cone <b>cells</b> contain light-sensitive pigment in their outer membranes called rhodopsin and iodopsin, respectively. Because of the greater preponderance of <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> present in most animals, most of the visual pigment studies are limited to those of the <b>rod</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Rod</b> <b>cells</b> are {{photoreceptor}} {{cells in}} the retina of the eye that can function in less intense light than the other type of visual photoreceptor, cone <b>cells.</b> <b>Rods</b> are usually found concentrated at the outer edges of the retina and are used in peripheral vision. On average, there are approximately 90 million <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> in the human retina. <b>Rod</b> <b>cells</b> are more sensitive than cone cells and are almost entirely responsible for night vision. However, rods have little role in color vision, {{which is one of}} the main reasons why colors are much less apparent in darkness.|$|R

When light levels are low enough for both <b>rods</b> and cone <b>cells</b> {{to be active}} (mesopic vision) the enhanced rod activity induces the bluish visual tint.|$|R

40|$|Hirokawa, Hideo (The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Properties of <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> {{reversed}} from penicillin spheroplasts in Escherichia coli. J. Bacteriol. 91 : 125 – 128. 1966. —Spheroplasts of Escherichia coli B- 054 {{were formed}} by penicillin, and {{the properties of}} <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> reversed from the spheroplasts were examined. It {{was found that the}} <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> were not capable of forming colonies when placed in a minimal medium immediately after the reversion, the postaddition of the nutrient to this medium being without effect. In this respect, the so-called residual cells which did not convert to spheroplasts by penicillin treatment behaved just as the reversed <b>rod</b> <b>cells.</b> These two types of cells, the reversed and residual <b>rod</b> <b>cells,</b> however, could grow up to form colonies when they were cultivated in a complex medium immediately after the reversion. The nutrient requirement and penicillin sensitivity of the progeny of these cells were found to be quite {{similar to those of the}} original untreated cells. Accordingly, it was concluded that the nutritional defect induced by penicillin treatment was not a hereditary change...|$|R
50|$|As the retinal {{component}} of rhodopsin {{is derived from}} vitamin A, a deficiency of vitamin A causes a deficit in the pigment needed by <b>rod</b> <b>cells.</b> Consequently, fewer <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> are able to sufficiently respond in darker conditions, and as the cone cells are poorly adapted for sight in the dark, blindness can result. This is night-blindness.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} calcium ions on the cGMP-activated current of outer segment {{membrane}} was {{examined by the}} excised-patch technique. Changes in the extracellular calcium concentration had marked effects on the cGMP-activated current, while changes in intracellular calcium concentration were ineffective. Changes in calcium concentration {{in the absence of}} cGMP had little, if any, effect on membrane conductance. These results suggest that both intracellular cGMP and extracellular calcium can directly affect the conductance underlying the light response in <b>rod</b> <b>cells.</b> The pharmacological agent l-cis-diltiazem reversibly inhibited the cGMP-activated current when applied to the intracellular side of an excised patch. When superfused over intact <b>rod</b> <b>cells,</b> l-cis-diltiazem reversibly blocked much of the normal light response. The isomer, d-cis-diltiazem, did not significantly affect either patches or intact <b>rod</b> <b>cells.</b> Thus, the light-regulated conductance has binding sites for both calcium and cGMP that may interact during the normal light response in <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> and a site specific for l-cis-diltiazem {{that can be used to}} identify and further study the conductance mechanism...|$|R

50|$|A human <b>rod</b> <b>cell</b> {{is about}} 2 microns in {{diameter}} and 100 microns long. Rods are not all morphologically the same; in mice, rods close to the outer plexiform synaptic layer display a reduced length due to a shortened synaptic terminal.|$|E
50|$|A <b>rod</b> <b>cell</b> is {{sensitive}} enough {{to respond to}} a single photon of light and is about 100 times more sensitive to a single photon than cones. Since rods require less light to function than cones, they are the primary source of visual information at night (scotopic vision). Cone cells, on the other hand, require tens to hundreds of photons to become activated. Additionally, multiple rod cells converge on a single interneuron, collecting and amplifying the signals. However, this convergence comes at a cost to visual acuity (or image resolution) because the pooled information from multiple cells is less distinct than it would be if the visual system received information from each <b>rod</b> <b>cell</b> individually.|$|E
50|$|In the {{rhodopsin}} system, which regulates <b>rod</b> <b>cell</b> {{function in}} the retina, rhodopsin kinase will phosphorylate serine and threonine residues on the rhodopsin receptor. Similarly to the βARK system, the phosphorylated rhodopsin residues will then bind to arrestin, resulting in receptor desensitization.|$|E
50|$|Dark {{adaptation}} {{depends upon}} photopigment bleaching, which affects {{the threshold of}} both cone and <b>rod</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
25|$|In contrast, cone {{cells are}} less {{sensitive}} to the overall intensity of light, but come in three varieties that are sensitive to different frequency-ranges and thus {{are used in the}} perception of colour and photopic vision. Cone cells are highly concentrated in the fovea and have a high visual acuity meaning that they are better at spatial resolution than <b>rod</b> <b>cells.</b> Since cone cells are not as sensitive to dim light as <b>rod</b> <b>cells,</b> most night vision is limited to <b>rod</b> <b>cells.</b> Likewise, since cone cells are in the fovea, central vision (including the vision needed to do most reading, fine detail work such as sewing, or careful examination of objects) is done by cone cells.|$|R

5000|$|Another study, {{from the}} Department of Ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, Maryland, saw similar effects in two {{components}} of bile, bilirubin and TUDCA, {{in relation to}} RP. Oxidative stress and prolonged light exposure were studied in rd10 mice and albino mice. In rd10 mice, intraperitoneal injections of bilirubin or TUDCA were given every 3 days starting at P6. This caused a considerable preservation in cone cell amount and function at P50, and a modest <b>rod</b> <b>cell</b> amount at P30. In the albino mice models, intraperitoneal injections of bilirubin or TUDCA were given prior to prolonged light exposure. Both treatments had positive effects {{on the health of}} the mouse retina, including a reduced accumulation of superoxide radicals, <b>rod</b> <b>cell</b> death, and disruption of cone inner and outer segments.

50|$|The Hunt color {{appearance}} model {{focuses on}} color image reproduction (its creator {{worked in the}} Kodak Research Laboratories). Development already started in the 1980s and by 1995 the model had become very complex (including features no other color appearance model offers, such as incorporating <b>rod</b> <b>cell</b> responses) and allowed to predict {{a wide range of}} visual phenomena. It had a very significant impact on CIECAM02, but because of its complexity the Hunt model itself is difficult to use.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a disease}} with normal <b>rod</b> and cone <b>cell</b> {{development}} but late onset degeneration of the <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> that progresses to the cone cells. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and {{has been linked to}} the ninth canine chromosome.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> having a peak {{sensitivity}} at a wavelength of 530 nanometers they cannot perceive all colours on the visual spectrum. Because <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> are insensitive to long wavelengths, the use of red lights and red lens glasses has become a common practise for accelerating dark adaptation. [...] In order for dark adaptation to be significantly accelerated an individual should ideally begin this practise 30 minutes prior to entering a low luminescence setting. [...] This practise will allow an individual to maintain their photopic (day) vision whilst preparing for scotopic vision. The insensitivity to red light will prevent the <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> from further becoming bleached and allow for the rhodopsin photopigment to recharge back to its active conformation. [...] Once an individual enters a dark setting most of their <b>rod</b> <b>cells</b> will already be accommodated to the dark {{and be able to}} transmit visual signals to the brain without an accommodation period. The concept of red lenses for dark adaptation is based upon experimentation by Antoine Béclère and his early work with radiology. In 1916, the scientist Wilhelm Trendelenburg invented the first pair of red adaptation goggles for radiologists to adapt their eyes to view screens during fluoroscopic procedures.|$|R
40|$|<b>Rod</b> bipolar <b>cells</b> relay visual signals {{evoked by}} dim {{illumination}} {{from the outer}} to the inner retina. GABAergic and glycinergic amacrine <b>cells</b> contact <b>rod</b> bipolar <b>cell</b> terminals, where they modulate transmitter release {{and contribute to the}} receptive field properties of third order neurones. However, it is not known how these distinct inhibitory inputs affect <b>rod</b> bipolar <b>cell</b> output and subsequent retinal processing. To determine whether GABAA, GABAC and glycine receptors made different contributions to light-evoked inhibition, we recorded light-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (L-IPSCs) from <b>rod</b> bipolar <b>cells</b> mediated by each pharmacologically isolated receptor. All three receptors contributed to L-IPSCs, but their relative roles differed; GABAC receptors transferred significantly more charge than GABAA and glycine receptors. We determined how these distinct inhibitory inputs affected <b>rod</b> bipolar <b>cell</b> output by recording light-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (L-EPSCs) from postsynaptic AII and A 17 amacrine cells. Consistent with their relative contributions to L-IPSCs, GABAC receptor activation most effectively reduced the L-EPSCs, while glycine and GABAA receptor activation reduced the L-EPSCs to a lesser extent. We also found that GABAergic L-IPSCs in <b>rod</b> bipolar <b>cells</b> were limited by GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition between amacrine cells. We show that GABAA, GABAC and glycine receptors mediate functionally distinct inhibition to <b>rod</b> bipolar <b>cells,</b> which differentially modulated light-evoked <b>rod</b> bipolar <b>cell</b> output. Our findings suggest that modulating the relative proportions of these inhibitory inputs could change the characteristics of <b>rod</b> bipolar <b>cell</b> output...|$|R
