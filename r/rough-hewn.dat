25|$|Bolte was a <b>rough-hewn</b> {{politician}} {{who liked to}} be seen as a simple farmer, but he had a shrewd political mind. He rapidly consolidated himself in power, helped by the expelled faction of the Labor Party, the Democratic Labor Party, which directed its second preferences to the Liberals at elections. His populist attacks on the trade unions, intellectuals, protesters and the press won him a large following.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish–American War Nurses Memorial is a {{memorial}} in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, in the United States that commemorates those American nurses {{who died in}} the Spanish–American War in 1898.

It stands in the southwestern corner of Section 21, where the first Spanish–American War nurses are buried.|$|E
25|$|The pyramid {{is one of}} {{only two}} {{examples}} of Richardson's work west of the Mississippi River, the other being the Isaac H. Lionberger House in St. Louis less than two miles from the river. Richardson's monolithic structure employed <b>rough-hewn</b> granite boulders in its construction. The monument's stones at the base are five feet by eight feet and weigh thousands of pounds each. The pyramid narrows from the base to become progressively smaller towards the top at a ratio of four inches to the foot.|$|E

25|$|After Dawes had {{finished}} his term as vice president, {{he served as}} the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom (i.e., to the Court of St. James's) from 1929 to 1932. Overall, Dawes {{was considered to be}} a very effective U.S. ambassador, as George V's son, the future Edward VIII, would later confirm in his memoirs. Dawes was rather <b>rough-hewn</b> for some of his duties, disliking having to present American débutantes to the King. On his first visit to the royal court, in deference to American public opinion, he refused to wear the customary Court dress, which then included knee breeches. This episode was said to upset the King, who had been prevented by illness from attending the event.|$|E
25|$|The schoolhouse was {{constructed}} as a two-room schoolhouse in 1930. It had been preceded by four earlier schoolhouses. The first schoolhouse was a 20 foot by 20 foot log construction built in 1882. This structure was expanded to 40 by 20 in 1885. This remained the town's only schoolhouse until the mid-1910s, {{when it was}} accidentally burned down by two students. A second structure, this one of wood frame, {{was constructed}} {{at a cost of}} $4,000 in 1916–17, and opened in the fall of 1917. The structure contained two classrooms, a stage, and a recreation hall. With a capacity of 300 people, it could hold more than the total population of the town. Lightning struck the building in 1919, resulting in a fire which burned the school to the ground. A temporary structure, again of <b>rough-hewn</b> timber was constructed to handle classes beginning in 1920. In addition to holding classes, all three of these buildings were also used for town meetings as well as religious services.|$|E

Another set was designed at Cardington as an [...] "underground prison", a <b>rough-hewn</b> labyrinth of stone cells in a vast abyss with a [...] vertical shaft leading to the surface. Exteriors above the prison were filmed in Jodhpur, India, chosen because the [...] "forbidding landscape added to the desolation".|$|E
500|$|In 1978, {{while making}} repairs to Bolton Town Hall, Dibnah was filmed by a {{regional}} BBC news crew. [...] The BBC then commissioned an award-winning documentary, which followed the <b>rough-hewn</b> steeplejack {{as he worked}} on chimneys, interacted {{with his family and}} talked about his favourite hobby—steam. [...] His Lancastrian manner and gentle, self-taught philosophical outlook, proved popular with viewers and he featured in a number of television programmes. [...] Toward the end of his life, the decline of Britain's industry was mirrored by a decline in his steeplejacking business and Dibnah increasingly came to rely on after-dinner speaking for his income. [...] In 1998, he presented a programme on Britain's industrial history and went on to present a number of series, largely concerned with the Industrial Revolution and its mechanical and architectural legacy.|$|E

[...] He states that the show's seeming weaknesses are part of the reason it succeeds, saying that it [...] "gets off to a choppy start, takes unnecessary musical detours and is staged in a <b>rough-hewn</b> style that sometimes seems more accidental than intentional" [...] but that it [...] "succeeds not despite these flaws but in large measure because of them. Bechdel's ironically self-aware and inwardly searching sensibility is honored by a musical that isn't afraid to reveal its awkward side." ...|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1881, the Boston & Albany began {{a massive}} {{improvement}} program {{that included the}} building of over 30 new stations along its main line {{as well as the}} Highland Branch, which it bought in 1883. Famed architect H. H. Richardson was hired to design nine of these stations, including South Framingham which was commissioned in October 1883. The $62,718 station, built in 1884–85 by the Norcross Brothers company, was the largest and costliest of the nine. The station {{is a prime example of}} the Richardsonian Romanesque style, built of <b>rough-hewn</b> granite with contrasting details. The dominant roofline, dormers, arched bow window, and wooden interior are typical of the style. Like many of Richardson's designs, the station was well-praised; Henry-Russell Hitchcock called it a [...] "better and somewhat more personal work" [...] in The Architecture of H. H. Richardson and His Time. A small square baggage room was built in the same style just east of the station, near the Concord Street (Route 126) grade crossing.|$|E

[...] in Latvian, Russian, German, and Hebrew languages. The immediate area is surrounded by 4,000 granite stones arranged in a grid of forty-five [...] squares, and resembles a traditional Jewish cemetery. The unique <b>rough-hewn</b> [...] high granite stones of black, gray, and reddish colors come from Zhytomyr region in Ukraine. The stones are carved with European city names representing the home towns of the victims. The entrances to the memorial and other grave sites in the forest are marked with concrete pillars with symbols representing various groups of the fallen– Star of David representing Jews, Crown of Thorns representing war prisoners, and Christian cross representing civilians. Historians from the New Synagogue Berlin– Centrum Judaicum, educational establishment House of the Wannsee Conference, and historians from the member cities have documented the names of over 31,000 victims, published in Book of Remembrance: The German, Austrian and Czechoslovakian Jews deported to the Baltic States (2003).|$|E
500|$|Joy Division {{made their}} {{recorded}} debut in June 1978 when the band self-released An Ideal for Living, {{and two weeks}} later a track of theirs, [...] "At a Later Date", was featured on the compilation album [...] (which had been recorded live in October 1977). In the Melody Maker review of the EP, Chris Brazier said that it [...] "has the familiar <b>rough-hewn</b> nature of home-produced records, but they're no mere drone-vendors—there {{are a lot of}} good ideas here, and they could be a very interesting band by now, seven months on". The packaging of An Ideal for Living—which featured a drawing of a Hitler Youth member on the cover—coupled with the nature of the band's name, fuelled speculation about their political affiliations. While Hook and Sumner later admitted to being intrigued by fascism at the time, Morris insisted that the group's obsession with Nazi imagery came from a desire to keep memories of the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents during World War II alive. He argued that accusations of neo-Nazi sympathies merely provoked the band [...] "to keep on doing it, because that's the kind of people we are".|$|E
500|$|Tom Moon of Rolling Stone {{felt that}} the song [...] "revealed new dimensions. The rhythm section {{displays}} a growing curiosity about studio texture and nuance". David Fricke of Rolling Stone said that [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] is a [...] "stark and uncommonly pensive ballad", commenting that the song [...] "drop-kicked the band into the Top10". Philip Booth of The Tampa Tribune believed that the single was [...] "undulating [...] omnipresent" [...] {{not only in the}} alternative rock genre, but in pop music as a whole. Ben DiPietro of the Richmond Times-Dispatch praised the record as a whole, but was most impressed by the Chili Peppers' shift from exclusive hard rock to adding more moderately paced tracks: [...] "there's still plenty of sonic funk to bang heads to, but the best tracks are the slower ones such as 'Under the Bridge'". Nick Griffiths (Select) described the song as [...] "all mellow strumming and thoughtfully shallow vocals, though it's almost exonerated by a shrill unexpectedly choral middle eight." [...] Amy Hanson of Allmusic noted that the song has [...] "become {{an integral part of the}} 1990s alterna-landscape, and remains one of the purest diamonds that sparkle amongst the <b>rough-hewn</b> and rich funk chasms that dominate the Peppers' own oeuvre". She went on to praise [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] for being a [...] "poignant sentiment that is self evident among the simple guitar which cradles the introductory verse, and the sense of fragility that is only doubled by the still down-tempo choral crescendo".|$|E
500|$|... "Under the Bridge", {{which became}} a {{breakout}} song for the band, {{was considered to be}} a highlight of the album by several critics. Allmusic reviewed the song individually and called it a [...] "...poignant sentiment... it is self evident among the simple guitar which cradles the introductory verse, and the sense of fragility that is only doubled by the still down-tempo choral crescendo", and ultimately [...] "has {{become an integral part of}} the 1990s alterna-landscape, and remains one of the purest diamonds that sparkle amongst the <b>rough-hewn</b> and rich funk chasms that dominate the Peppers' own oeuvre." [...] However, Entertainment Weekly criticized the seriousness that the Red Hot Chili Peppers explored as being [...] "disapproving of the band's usual Red Hot antics", and [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] had [...] "fancy-shmancy touches". The song ended up peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1992. [...] "Give It Away" [...] was also praised, though as [...] "...a free-associative mixture of positive vibes, tributes to musical heroes, and free love", with Frusciante [...] "...adding the song's two most unpredictable change-ups: a sudden contrast to Kiedis' hyperactivity in the form of a languid solo pre-recorded and dubbed backwards over the rhythm track, and a hard-rocking riff which is not introduced until the song's outro..." [...] Tracks such as [...] "Sir Psycho Sexy", however, were criticized for being overly explicit. Devon Powters of Pop Matters said that [...] "Eight minutes of 'Sir Psycho Sexy' will turn RHCP's young listeners into quivering masses of hormonal jello. Oversexed lines sneak their way into 'Apache Rose Peacock'; 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik', simply, sounds like fucking. Even the purest virgin comes away from Blood Sugar Sex Magik with a degree of sexual maturity; even the slickest playa can learn a couple of new moves." [...] In contrast, [...] "Suck My Kiss", according to Amy Hanson of Allmusic, [...] "completely flew in the face of the established pecking order of alternative rock." [...] With the song, the Chili Peppers [...] "fully allied themselves with the very few genre-bending bands that were able to make a radical impact on the sonic landscape that was dominated, it seemed, from every minute angle by grunge." ...|$|E

Konstantin Thon, the most popular Russian architect of the time, used Italianate elements profusely for decorating some interiors of the Grand Kremlin Palace (1837-1851). Another fashionable architect, Andrei Stackensneider, was responsible for Marie Palace (1839-1844), with [...] "the faceted <b>rough-hewn</b> stone of the first floor" [...] reminiscent of 16th-century Italian palazzi.|$|E
2500|$|Said {{journalist}} Hackett, [...] "Ivey was a <b>rough-hewn</b> yet lyrical painter {{interested in}} feeling, not fact. Within {{the frame of}} a canvas, he painted a frame with colors pouring out. He wanted to capture the visual pulse of a scene without bogging it down in particulars. [...] He wanted to chip the barnacle of language off purely visual sensations. By blurring them, he hoped to restore them {{to some kind of}} original fresh sight. Thus, for all his disclaimers and tough-guy fortitude, he was a romantic to his bones." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1821 through 1845, during Florida's {{territorial}} period, the <b>rough-hewn</b> frontier capital gradually {{developed as}} a town.

Gordon assured the people of Khartoum in a speech delivered in his <b>rough-hewn</b> Arabic that the Mahdi was coming with his Army of Islam marching under their black banners, but to have no fear as here he would be stopped.

His portraits come from many angles – the baroque stillness of Gummo contrasts radically with the <b>rough-hewn</b> melodrama of Julien Donkey-Boy.

The work was sculpted by Adelaide Johnson (1859-1955) from a [...] block of marble in Carrara, Italy. The portraits are copies of the individual busts she carved for the Court of Honor of the Woman's Building at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. The detailed busts are surrounded by <b>rough-hewn</b> marble {{at the top of the}} sculpture. This part of the statue, according to some, is left unfinished representing the unfinished work of women's rights. Contrary to a popular story, the intention was not that it be completed upon the ascension of the first female President — the <b>rough-hewn</b> section is too small to carry a proportional bust. The monument was presented to the Capitol as a gift from the women of the United States by the National Woman's Party and was accepted on behalf of Congress by the Joint Committee on the Library on February 10, 1921. The unveiling ceremony was held in the Rotunda on February 15, 1921, the 101st anniversary of the birth of Susan B. Anthony, and was attended by representatives of over 70 women's organizations. Shortly after its unveiling, however, the statue was moved into the Capitol Crypt. It remained on display there for 75 years, until HCR 216 ordered it moved to the Rotunda. The statue was placed in its current location, in the Rotunda, in May 1997.|$|E
