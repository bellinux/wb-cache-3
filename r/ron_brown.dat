25|$|After {{a disappointing}} {{end to the}} 2010 season, Nebraska began 2011 with wins in its first four games against Chattanooga, Fresno State, Washington, and Wyoming. Nebraska was {{defeated}} by the Wisconsin Badgers in the Cornhuskers' first Big Ten Conference game. The Cornhuskers came out strong tying it up at 14–14 with four minutes {{to go in the}} 2nd quarter, but Wisconsin's offense dominated Nebraska in the 2nd half and ending up winning the game with a score of 48–17. Nebraska rebounded by winning three games in a row, including a 21-point second half comeback – the largest in school history – against Ohio State and a 24–3 win versus #9 Michigan State. After that winning streak they were upset by the unranked Northwestern Wildcats where they suffered two fumbles inside the Northwestern 30 yard line. Following the loss came the game against #12 Penn State. The week leading up to the game had much of the national focus revolving the firing of coach Joe Paterno and the sexual assault charges in the Penn State sex abuse scandal. A prayer was held before the game for both teams by Nebraska running backs coach <b>Ron</b> <b>Brown.</b> The Cornhuskers would win the game 17–14. January 2, 2012, Nebraska lost the 2012 Capital One Bowl to the South Carolina Gamecocks, 13–30.|$|E
500|$|Several Clinton appointees {{then came}} forward. [...] Secretary of Commerce <b>Ron</b> <b>Brown</b> {{said he had}} failed to pay the taxes for a maid. [...] The Brown case {{attracted}} a fair amount of attention, with 40percent of Americans thinking he should step down as a result (he did not). [...] Secretary of Transportation Federico Peña said he would pay back taxes owed for a part-time babysitter. [...] Other appointees said they had examined their records and were clean. [...] Stephanopoulos himself came under attention, but said the cleaner he had hired was from a cleaning company. [...] The matter resulted in a slowdown of hiring for all positions, in what Secretary of Defense Les Aspin called a [...] "chilling effect".
