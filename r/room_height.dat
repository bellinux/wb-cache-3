25|$|During {{the eighteenth}} century, the Hofburg was {{transformed}} and renovated in the Baroque style under Empress Maria Theresa (1717–1780). The reconstruction project lasted from 1754 to 1776 and occurred in two phases, {{interrupted by the}} Seven Years' War (1754–1763). The first phase began with the submission of plans in 1754 by Johann Martin Gumpp the Younger, who was commissioned to create new offices in the south wing (along Hofgasse), add a large central staircase, standardize the floor levels and <b>room</b> <b>heights,</b> and remove narrow stairs and unnecessary walls to produce comfortable rooms with uniform flooring and evenly-spaced windows.|$|R

Boyd placed the apartments on an east/west axis, to maximise {{the views of the}} Botanic Gardens to the north and Port Phillip Bay to the south. Each main room was to have both north and south views and the block was planned to be narrow enough to accommodate this, with main rooms spanning the width of the block. <b>Room</b> <b>height</b> was used to convey a sense of spatial compression and ensure occupants remained aware of the views to the outside world.|$|E
5000|$|Wu's work evolved, yet certain themes remained. His single-family houses {{typically}} {{revolved around}} a central core (or courtyard as in DuPont) {{from which all}} rooms emanated. He frequently used changes of <b>room</b> <b>height</b> to follow terrain or define space. Windows dominated, at times seeming to reach toward the light, often rising above the roofline to do so. The neat, rhythmic pattern of glass in the early houses evolved into an often incomprehensible and varied placement of windows of various sizes and shapes in the later work. Large expanses of glass remained a constant. Indeed, one of Wu's long-running courses at Yale, [...] "Daylight and Architecture" [...] emphasized his belief that daylight was [...] "the most noble of natural phenomena".|$|E

50|$|In 1966 a £92,000 {{contract}} was commissioned for the Sixth Form Building which connected the Science Extension to the Finsbury Technical College Building. The new building, opened in 1968, could {{not match the}} varying styles, roof lines, nor the <b>room</b> <b>height</b> of the existing buildings and so, while there are corridors and staircases linking all three buildings, the floors are inconsistent. The new building provided the sixth form with a common room {{as well as a}} library, laboratory and art and pottery room. The library remained there until 2008 and the sixth form common room was returned in 2014 after moving {{to the other side of}} the site.

50|$|Between 2012 and 2014, {{the group}} of halls {{dedicated}} to World War I was completely converted, modernised, and redesigned. To enlarge the initial exhibition area from 1,000 to 1,400 m², the <b>room</b> <b>height</b> was reduced and an intermediate platform was introduced, so that the entire exhibition now spreads over three levels. As {{a result of these}} measures, some 2,000 items relating to World War I are now accessible to the public, about twice as many as were on display in the previous exhibition.A series of display cabinets contain the uniforms, weapons, and equipment of the warring powers. At the beginning of the exhibition, the themes focus on the mobilization of the troops in the summer of 1914, the Austrian infantry, followed by the cavalry. Next on display are uniforms and arms of the opposing parties, the Kingdom of Serbia, the Russian Empire, and the Kingdom of Italy, which declared war on Austria-Hungary in 1915. This led to the so-called Italian Front of 1915-1918, to which a separate area is dedicated to in the exhibition. A particular exhibit is the 7-cm M 1899 mountain gun which was positioned around the Ortler summit at an altitude of 3,850 meters, making it Europe's highest gun emplacement. Apart from the weapons, uniforms, and military equipment items, the exhibition also thematizes other related material in separate areas, such as women in war, the k.u.k. military justice system, escape and displacement, deprivation and propaganda, injury and emergency medical services, religion, war captivity, disability and death. Hundreds of digital images and films are presented on flat screens.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the range of}} collimation errors in x-ray rooms and to calculate their possible effects on the radiation dose for anteroposterior pelvic examinations. Methods: A collimator test tool was suspended at 3 heights (14, 21, and 28 cm) above the table Bucky in 9 x-ray <b>rooms.</b> <b>Heights</b> corresponded to the typical patient thickness (mean, ± 2 SD) of 67 patients undergoing anteroposterior pelvic radiography. The x-ray beam was visually collimated to the inner boundary of the test tool and exposed to radiation. Differences between the visualized field size and the resultant x-ray field size (corrected for magnification) indicated a collimation error. Next, using a pelvic phantom, minimum textbook collimation was set and then changed and verified to simulate a range of possible collimation errors. Phantom examinations used a standard anteroposterior technique with exposure termination using outer automatic exposure control chambers. Dose area product (DAP) was recorded.

5000|$|The Doctor's Tower {{was also}} {{known by the}} name of Kunibert Tower after Romita's son-in-law, to whom he left the Tower with the {{vineyard}} {{in the name of the}} dowry. Like Vito Romita, his son-in-law Bartolomeo Kunibert was a doctor, and at one time he was the doctor of Prince Miloš and his family, but also the first doctor of the surroundings and the city of Belgrade, by the Prince's order. He also founded the first pharmacy in Belgrade in 1827 and the family remained in the house until 1851. After Romita's death, his wife, daughter and son-in-law were not able to take care of the building and its maintenance financially, so they handed the house over to Prince Mihailo Obrenović. The interior is rich in decoration, especially the ceiling, and all the woodwork is made of solid wood. Oriental influence is seen in the pointed top of the front door, and it is typically Central European when it comes to the <b>room</b> <b>height.</b> In 1861, Doctor's Tower was given medical purpose, and thus it became the backbone of the future clinical center, which is now located around it. The decree signed by Prince Mihailo defines the structure of the Tower that the House will keep and treat all those who have [...] "lost their mind" [...] from all over Serbia. The first patient was admitted on 26 August 1861, and in 1881 it grew into a hospital for mental illness. The managers of the hospital in the first thirty years of work were: Dr. Florian Birg, Dr Vasa Todorović, Dr. Mladen Janković, Dr. Đorđe Ilinkovski, Dr. Jovan Danić, and Dr. Milan Vasić. The most significant psychiatrist of the hospital was Dr. Laza Lazarević.|$|E

40|$|A {{model for}} {{displacement}} ventilation {{system based on}} plume rise of single point heat source was developed. The errors for temperature gradient ratio were less than 6 % in most cases. Errors for temperature gradient and displacement zone height were relatively higher (up to 28. 1 %) which {{might be due to}} the derivation of the parameters from experimental data. Still, the errors were lower than those from design model/method of some other workers (68. 5 % for the temperature gradient ratio and 15. 7 % for the temperature difference between the supply air and at 0. 1 m above floor level). With a <b>room</b> <b>height</b> of 2. 4 m (common for office in Hong Kong) and design room temperature 25. 5 °C defined at 1. 1 m above floor level under the normal load to air flow ratio of 12, 000 W/m 3 /s (typical values for sub-tropical region) and minimum supply temperature of 18 °C, there existed a zone capacity range from 1000 to 5000 W that stand alone operation displacement ventilation system was feasible and that the displacement zone height (minimum 2. 2 m) was above normal breathing level. The feasible zone capacity range diminished with decrease in design room temperature and/or <b>room</b> <b>height.</b> In this case, the load to air flow ratio had to be reduced, resulting in a higher flow rate when compared to a mixing ventilation system, or an auxiliary cooling facility such as a chilled ceiling had to be used. © 2006 Elsevier B.

The NLOS environment was more diffuse than the LOS channel and the power propagating over the NLOS channel tends to be more distributed around the specular directions than the LOS case, due to the wall which separates the Tx and Rx. Intra-cluster properties were derived based on the moment analysis, instead of deriving a probability density function (PDF) within the cluster.

40|$|Abstract. Kapok fibre {{possesses}} high {{thermal resistance}} and can retard {{the rate of}} heat flow into the building through the roof.
