5|$|The {{current flowing}} from the {{ionosphere}} to the plasma sheet is especially strong when the corresponding part of the plasma sheet rotates slower than the planet. As mentioned above, co-rotation breaks down in the region located between 20 and 40RJ from Jupiter. This region corresponds to the magnetodisk, where the magnetic field is highly stretched. The strong direct current flowing into the magnetodisk originates in a very limited latitudinal range of about ° from the Jovian magnetic poles. These narrow circular regions correspond to Jupiter's main auroral ovals. (See below.) The <b>return</b> <b>current</b> {{flowing from the}} outer magnetosphere beyond 50RJ enters the Jovian ionosphere near the poles, closing the electrical circuit. The total radial current in the Jovian magnetosphere is estimated at 60 million–140million amperes.|$|E

25|$|To {{alleviate}} the situation, KSS's board approved plans in December 1897 for electrify their network. Meanwhile, the board decided to convert its entire network to double track. As tracks for an electric tramway {{had to be}} designed to allow for <b>return</b> <b>current,</b> an all-new trackage {{would have to be}} laid. These plans were approved by the annual meeting on 17 January 1898. The company both needed a supplier and capital, and struck a deal with Union-Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft, who would deliver the new infrastructures and trams, and also provided capital through purchasing a majority stake in the company. There was a general understanding for the conversion in the public, although there were many protests against installing overhead lines in Karl Johans gate.|$|E
25|$|On {{the main}} section, each segment is {{equipped}} with twenty optical communications repeaters. These run off direct current fed from Breivika, with the seawater and seabed used for <b>return</b> <b>current.</b> Power is provided through a single-end feed; although supplying from both ends is safer, a single feed was regarded as sufficient. The cables are fed 1.1 ampere at 2,500 volt, fed from two redundant converters. Each repeater has eight erbium doped fiber amplifier pairs. The pairs operate independent of each other, including having their own power supply, allowing for redundancy should one fall out. The repeaters have an estimated lifetime of twenty-five years. The cables are equipped with an ocean ground protection panel to provide isolation and thus hinder damage from lightning.|$|E
25|$|Waveguides {{are similar}} to coaxial cables, as both consist of tubes, with the biggest {{difference}} being that the waveguide has no inner conductor. Waveguides can have any arbitrary cross section, but rectangular cross sections are the most common. Because waveguides {{do not have an}} inner conductor to carry a <b>return</b> <b>current,</b> waveguides cannot deliver energy by means of an electric current, but rather by means of a guided electromagnetic field. Although surface currents do flow on the inner walls of the waveguides, those surface currents do not carry power. Power is carried by the guided electromagnetic fields. The surface currents are set up by the guided electromagnetic fields and have the effect of keeping the fields inside the waveguide and preventing leakage of the fields to the space outside the waveguide. Waveguides have dimensions comparable to the wavelength of the alternating current to be transmitted, so they are only feasible at microwave frequencies. In addition to this mechanical feasibility, electrical resistance of the non-ideal metals forming the walls of the waveguide cause dissipation of power (surface currents flowing on lossy conductors dissipate power). At higher frequencies, the power lost to this dissipation becomes unacceptably large.|$|E

25|$|The key {{advantage}} of the four-rail system is that neither running rail carries any current. This scheme was introduced because {{of the problems of}} return currents, intended to be carried by the earthed (grounded) running rail, flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together. The problem was exacerbated because the <b>return</b> <b>current</b> also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains that predated London's underground railways, were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments. The four-rail system solves the problem. Although the supply has an artificially created earth point, this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels. Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak, but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains. However, elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails.|$|E
500|$|In 1910, {{construction}} started of {{an electric}} power supply for tracks at the port. Originally it had 500 volts direct current, but this was later reduced to 400 volts. Because an overhead wire could interfere with the cranes, third-rail conduction was chosen. However, because {{of the possibility of}} iron slimes spilling onto the tracks, the railway chose to use two third rail conductors, one {{on each side of the}} track, and avoid the <b>return</b> <b>current</b> running through the tracks. The electric components were delivered by Siemens-Schukert and were taken into use in 1912. The company took delivery of two electric locomotives, both with a Bo wheel arrangement, in 1910 and 1911.

40|$|Facies {{analysis}} of Priabonian shallow-water carbonate successions in the outcrops near Mossano (eastern Colli Berici, northeastern Italy) {{and the subsequent}} integration of palaeoecological data {{have been used to}} produce a detailed palaeoenvironmental model. The facies distribution and the processes, which controlled the larger benthic foraminiferal and coralline algal assemblages in the study Priabonian storm-influenced, carbonate ramp, are discussed in detail. In the middle-ramp trough, cross-bedded small Nummulites and rhodolith packstones pass laterally into coralline algal crust wackestones. These rhodoliths exhibit two well-differentiated growth-phases: the first occurring during low-water energy periods, followed by a second developed during high-energy events during which they were reworked and partially destroyed. These facies pass laterally into orthophragminid rudstones and packstones characterised by orthophragminid tests and channel structures. The latter were formed by storm-induced <b>return</b> <b>currents,</b> which swept the middle-ramp creating distal middle-ramp channel structures. Further toward the distal part of the middle-ramp the <b>return</b> <b>currents</b> decreased in energy and discharged nutrients allowing the coralline crustose pavement to develop. This is characterised by rhodoliths typically discoidal in shape (up to 10 cm in diameter) with a loose inner arrangement consisting of encrusting-to-foliose growth-forms. The occurrence of the channel structures in orthophragminid rudstones and in the coralline crustose pavement appears to be unique in Upper Eocene carbonate ramp depositional systems. During the erosive events associated with the <b>return</b> <b>currents,</b> these shallow-water carbonates were unlithified or only weakly lithified and were, therefore, easily transported into deeper water ramp settings. The model suggests that the significant changes of the middle-ramp benthic communities with depth could have formed, at least in part, by offshore <b>return</b> <b>currents,</b> which {{played an important role in}} both controlling substrates and in supplying nutrients...|$|R

2500|$|In the Faraday's disc example, {{the disc}} is rotated {{in a uniform}} {{magnetic}} field perpendicular to the disc, causing a current to flow in the radial arm due to the Lorentz force. It is interesting to understand how it arises that mechanical work is necessary to drive this current. When the generated current flows through the conducting rim, a magnetic field is generated by this current through Ampère's circuital law (labeled [...] "induced B" [...] in the figure). The rim thus becomes an electromagnet that resists rotation of the disc (an example of Lenz's law). On {{the far side of}} the figure, the <b>return</b> <b>current</b> flows from the rotating arm through {{the far side of the}} rim to the bottom brush. The B-field induced by this <b>return</b> <b>current</b> opposes the applied B-field, tending to decrease the flux through that side of the circuit, opposing the increase in flux due to rotation. On the near side of the figure, the <b>return</b> <b>current</b> flows from the rotating arm through the near side of the rim to the bottom brush. The induced B-field increases the flux on this side of the circuit, opposing the decrease in flux due to rotation. Thus, both sides of the circuit generate an EMF opposing the rotation. The energy required to keep the disc moving, despite this reactive force, is exactly equal to the electrical energy generated (plus energy wasted due to friction, Joule heating, and other inefficiencies). This behavior is common to all generators converting mechanical energy to electrical energy.|$|E

The {{current of}} {{electricity}} which induces the electro-tonic {{state in a}} neighbouring wire, probably induces that state also in its own wire; for when by a current in one wire a collateral wire is made electro-tonic, the latter state is not rendered any way incompatible or interfering with a current of electricity passing through it (62.). If, therefore, the current were sent through the second wire instead of the first, {{it does not seem}} probable that its inducing action upon the second would be less, but on the contrary more, because the distance between the agent and the matter acted upon would be very greatly diminished.

40|$|Due to the {{integration}} of wireless modules and on-board antennas at printed circuit board (PCB) level, design engineers are faced with even more difficult challenges to avoid intra-system electromagnetic interference issues. When starting to design a printed circuit board, the first rule is to partition the printed circuit board such that noisy components are placed physically far away from sensitive components. This rule relies on the phenomenon that at moderately high frequencies, <b>return</b> <b>currents</b> tend to stay in proximity of and close to their signal currents. Unfortunately, on-board antennas most often induce antenna currents which are distributed over {{a large part of}} the PCB’s power/ground planes. As a result, significant interference might even happen with circuits which are placed physically far away from the antenna’s location. During the whole design process, the engineer has to make sure that the overlap area between the antenna <b>currents</b> and the <b>return</b> <b>currents</b> paths of the critical circuits is as minimal as possible. This is achieved by properly placing circuits, keeping track of the antenna current distribution, and by avoiding all return path discontinuities. “Intuitive” solutions as putting a slot around the critical circuits might actually lead to higher electromagnetic interference levels. Hence, full-wave simulations which allow for visualizing all current distributions and their interactions, are an important asset in aiding the design process. The simulation process becomes a key element in a judicial component placement to minimize the interaction between antenna <b>currents</b> and <b>return</b> <b>currents</b> in PCB designs. status: publishe...|$|R
