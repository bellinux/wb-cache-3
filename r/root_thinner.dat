40|$|Antarctica, remain one of {{the most}} enigmatic {{mountain}} ranges on Earth. A lack of direct geologic samples renders their tectonic history almost totally unconstrained. We utilize teleseismic Rayleigh wave data from a 2 year deployment of broadband seismic stations across the region to image shear velocity structure and analyze the lithospheric age of the GSM and surrounding regions. We solve for 2 -D phase velocities and invert these results for 3 -D shear velocity structure. We perform a Monte Carlo simulation to improve constraints of crustal thickness and shear velocity structure. Beneath the core of the GSM, we find crustal thickness in excess of 55 km. Mantle shear velocities remain faster than global average models to a depth of approximately 250 km, indicating a thick lithospheric <b>root.</b> <b>Thinner</b> crust and slower upper mantle velocities are observed beneath the Lambert Rift System and the Polar Subglacial Basin. When compared with phase velocity curves corresponding to specific tectonothermal ages elsewhere in the world, average phase velocity results for the GSM are consistent with regions of Archean-Paleoproterozoic origin. Combined with radiometric ages of detrital zircons found offshore, these results indicate a region of old crust that has undergone repeated periods of uplift and erosion, most recently during the Mesozoic breakup of Gondwana. Lower crustal seismic velocities imply a moderately dense lower crust beneath the core of the GSM, but with lower density than suggested by recent gravity models...|$|E

40|$|The {{success of}} a plant depends in part {{on its ability to}} locate water while {{securely}} anchoring in the soil. Cellular growth in roots is driven by water uptake and resulting increases in turgor pressure. Low water potentials slow the rate of primary root growth and induce a suite of changes in the growth zone. To better understand the effects of low water potentials on the growth and structure of primary roots, Zea mays seedlings were grown in different concentrations of polyethylene glycol solution. The effects of low water potentials on the water content, the spatial distribution of growth, and the mechanical properties of the root throughout the growth zone were quantified. Low water potentials decreased the total amount of water in roots and the percent water composition of roots. Low water potentials also decreased relative elemental growth rate and shifted the region of maximal growth rate towards the root tip. Because of water stress induced <b>root</b> <b>thinning</b> and cell wall stress relaxation at the cellular level, low water potentials were expected to alter the mechanical properties of roots. Engineering beam theory was adapted to test for water stress induced changes in the spatial distributions of flexural stiffness (EI), the product of the material term E (Young's modulus of elasticity) and the geometrical term I (second moment of area). Low water potentials decreased EI of roots, due mostly to <b>root</b> <b>thinning</b> (and thus reductions of I). Increasing water stress had no consistent effects on E, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms to maintain root material properties despite cellular changes in wall properties due to water stress. <b>Root</b> <b>thinning</b> in low water potentials results from the promotion of longitudinal over lateral growth to facilitate finding deeper water sources. Though water stress weakens roots by reducing EI, soil impedance has been shown previously to cause root thickening. Soil impedance could thus offset <b>root</b> <b>thinning</b> by low water potentials and increase EI of roots by increasing I. Further studies should test the hypothesis that water stress and impedance have counterbalancing effects on root mechanical properties, thus promoting deep penetration of soils for water while maintaining the mechanical properties necessary for penetrating hard soils...|$|R

40|$|The {{mammalian}} tooth forms by {{a series}} of reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Although several signaling pathways and transcription factors have been implicated in regulating molar crown development, relatively {{little is known about the}} regulation of root development. Four genes encoding nuclear factor I (NFI) transcription-replication proteins are present in the mouse genome: Nfia, Nfib, Nfic, and Nfix. In order to elucidate its physiological role(s), we disrupted the Nfic gene in mice. Heterozygous animals appear normal, whereas Nfic−/− mice have unique tooth pathologies: molars lacking <b>roots,</b> <b>thin</b> and brittle mandibular incisors, and weakened abnormal maxillary incisors. Feeding in Nfic−/− mice is impaired, resulting in severe runting and premature death of mice reared on standard laboratory chow. However, a soft-dough diet mitigates the feeding impairment and maintains viability. Although Nfic is expressed in many organ systems, including the developing tooth, the tooth root development defects were the prominent phenotype. Indeed, molar crown development is normal, and well-nourished Nfic−/− animals are fertile and can live as long as their wild-type littermates. The Nfic mutation is the first mutation described that affects primarily tooth root formation and should greatly aid our understanding of postnatal tooth development...|$|R
40|$|As {{a system}} to study the {{regulation}} of growth anisotropy, we studied thinning of the primary root of maize (Zea mays L.) occurring developmentally or induced by water stress. Seedlings were transplanted into vermiculite at a water potential of approximately - 0. 03 MPa (well-watered) or - 1. 6 MPa (water-stressed). The diameter of roots in both treatments decreased with time after transplanting; the water-stressed <b>roots</b> became substantially <b>thinner</b> than well-watered <b>roots</b> at steady state, showing that <b>root</b> <b>thinning</b> is a genuine response to water stress. To analyze the thinning responses we quantified cell numbers and the spatial profiles of longitudinal, radial, and tangential expansion rates separately for the cortex and stele. The results showed {{that there was no}} zone of isotropic expansion and the degree of anisotropy varied greatly with position and treatment. Thinning over time in well-watered roots was caused by rates of radial and tangential expansion being too low to maintain the shape of the root. In response to low water potential, cell number in both tissues was unchanged radially but increased tangentially, which shows that thinning was caused wholly by reduced cell expansion. Water stress substantially decreased rates of tangential and radial expansion in both the stele and cortex, but only in the apical 5 mm of the root; basal to this, rates were similar in well-watered and water-stressed roots. By contrast, as in previous studies, longitudinal expansion was identical between the treatments in the apical 3 mm but in water-stressed roots was inhibited at more basal locations. The results show that expansion in longitudinal and radial directions can be regulated independently...|$|R

[URL] {{plant material}} {{is essential for}} observing internal structures and {{may be difficult for}} various reasons. Most fixation agents such as aldehydes, as well as embedding resins, do not allow subsequent use of fluorescent staining and make material too soft to make good-quality hand-sections. Moreover, cutting <b>thin</b> <b>roots</b> can be very difficult and time consuming. A new, fast and effective method to provide good-quality sections and fluorescent staining of fresh or fixed root samples, including those of very <b>thin</b> <b>roots</b> (such as Arabidopsis or Noccaea), is described here. To overcome the above-mentioned difficulties the following procedure is proposed: fixation in methanol (when fresh material cannot be used) followed by en bloc staining with toluidine blue, embedding in 6 agarose, preparation of free-hand sections of embedded material, staining with fluorescent dye, and observation in a microscope under UV light. Despite eventual slight deformation of primary cell walls (depending on the species and root developmental stage), this method allows effective observation of different structures such as ontogenetic changes of cells along the root axis, e. g. development of xylem elements, deposition of Casparian bands and suberin lamellae in endodermis or exodermis or peri-endodermal thickenings in Noccaea roots. This method provides good-quality sections and allows relatively rapid detection of cell-wall modifications.

40|$|Recent {{declines in}} sea grass {{distribution}} underscore {{the importance of}} understanding microbial community structure-function relationships in sea grass rhizospheres that might affect the viability of these plants. Phospholipid fatty acid analyses showed that sulfate-reducing bacteria and clostridia were enriched in sediments colonized by the sea grasses Halodule wrightii and Thalassia testudinum compared to an adjacent unvegetated sediment. Most-probable-number analyses found that in contrast to butyrate-producing clostridia, acetogens and acetate-utilizing sulfate reducers were enriched by {{an order of magnitude}} in rhizosphere sediments. Although sea grass roots are oxygenated in the daytime, colorimetric root incubation studies demonstrated that acetogenic O-demethylation and sulfidogenic iron precipitation activities were tightly associated with washed, sediment-free H. wrightii roots. This suggests that the associated anaerobes are able to tolerate exposure to oxygen. To localize and quantify the anaerobic microbial colonization, <b>root</b> <b>thin</b> sections were hybridized with newly developed 33 P-labeled probes that targeted (i) low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria, (ii) cluster I species of clostridia, (iii) species of Acetobacterium, and (iv) species of Desulfovibrio. Microautoradiography revealed intercellular colonization of the roots by Acetobacterium and Desulfovibrio species. Acetogenic bacteria occurred mostly in the rhizoplane and outermost cortex cell layers, and high numbers of sulfate reducers were detected on all epidermal cells and inward, colonizing some 60 % of the deepest cortex cells. Approximately 30 % of epidermal cells were colonized by bacteria that hybridized with an archaeal probe, strongly suggesting the presence of methanogens. Obligate anaerobes within the roots might contribute to the vitality of sea grasses and other aquatic plants and to the biogeochemistry of the surrounding sediment...|$|R

Here we quantify the degree of variation in functional traits for the first-order roots across large geographical scales and examine the potential mechanisms underlying these patterns. Location China. Methods We collected first-order roots (stream-based ordering system) and leaf samples of 65 tree species in six forests from subtropical to temperate zones and determined the key morphological, architectural and chemical traits. Results We found wider variation in root morphology in the subtropical zone, where species with very thick and very <b>thin</b> first-order <b>roots</b> coexisted, in contrast with narrower variation among species in the temperate zone. Inconsistent with the predictions of trait economics spectrum, root nitrogen concentration was uncorrelated with root morphology. Furthermore, average root diameter at the plant family level decreased markedly with their divergence time in both piecewise and phylogenetic independent contrast regression analyses. Main conclusions Higher variation in root morphology in the subtropical zone appears to result from the coexistence of tree species with thick and <b>thin</b> <b>roots,</b> probably because of a more favourable water supply. Patterns of <b>root</b> evolution towards <b>thinner</b> <b>roots</b> were driven by both phylogeny and possible adaptation of newly diverged species to drier habitats from mid to late Cretaceous.
