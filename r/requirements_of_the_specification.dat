5|$|Wood {{observed}} that the <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification</b> were of a multi-role nature, akin to the Hawker Siddeley P.1154 and variable geometry General Dynamics F-111K. In RAF service, the AFVG had originally been intended {{to serve as a}} fighter, replacing the English Electric Lightning in the interceptor mission. However, following the decision to procure the American-built McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II instead, the AFVG's expected role was changed in 1966 to supplementing the F-111K strike aircraft in replacing the English Electric Canberra and the V bomber force.|$|E
5|$|The HP.80 and Avro's Type 698 {{were chosen}} as the best two of the {{proposed}} designs to B.35/46, and orders for two prototypes of each were placed. It was recognised, however, {{that there were many}} unknowns associated with both designs, and an order was also placed for Vickers' design, which became the Valiant. Although not fully meeting the <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification,</b> the Valiant design posed little risk of failure and could therefore reach service earlier. The HP.80's crescent wing was tested on a ⅓-scale glider, the HP.87, and a heavily modified Supermarine Attacker, which was given the Handley Page HP.88 designation. The HP.88 crashed on 26 August 1951 after completing only about thirty flights and little useful data was gained during its brief two months of existence. By the time the HP.88 was ready, the HP.80 wing had changed such that the former was no longer representative. The design of the HP.80 had sufficiently advanced that the loss of the HP.88 had little effect on the programme.|$|E
25|$|Derived {{from the}} Ro.37 Lince {{reconnaissance}} aircraft, {{by the same}} designer, the Ro.43 first flew in 1934. The plane was built of steel tubes and wood covered by soft alloy and fabric. It was a two-seat biplane with folding gull upper and inverse gull lower wings, lightly armed and capable of around 300km/h (185mph) and over 1,000km (620mi) range. This performance more than met the <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification,</b> {{and so it was}} declared the winner.|$|E

25|$|Following {{relaxation}} {{of some of}} the specifications requirements, Blackburn constructed a second aircraft as a private venture, with a watertight metal monocoque fuselage replacing the previous steel tube fuselage, this first flying on 24 February 1933. Because it was a private venture it received and carried the Blackburn Class B civil test marking B-3 and was referred to as such, though it was also known as the M.1/30A. It performed poorly during testing, still being incapable of meeting the performance <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification</b> even though they had been relaxed, and being too heavy for the carrier deck lifts. As none of the competitors for the specification could meet its requirements, the specification was cancelled, with no aircraft being ordered.|$|E
25|$|Mitsubishi {{assigned}} {{the task of}} designing the new fighter to {{a team led by}} Jiro Horikoshi (original creator of the similar but unsuccessful Mitsubishi 1MF10, and later responsible for the famous A6M Zero). The resulting design, designated Ka-14 by Mitsubishi, was an all-metal low-wing fighter, with a thin elliptical inverted gull wing and a fixed undercarriage, which was chosen as the increase in performance (estimated as 10% in drag, but only a mere 3% increase in maximum speed) arising from use of a retractable undercarriage was not felt to justify the extra weight. The first prototype, powered by a 447kW (600hp) Nakajima Kotobuki 5 radial engine, flew on 4 February 1935. The aircraft far exceeded the <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification,</b> with a maximum speed of 450km/h (279mph) being reached. The second prototype was fitted with a revised, ungulled wing, and after various changes to maximize maneuverability and reduce drag, was ordered into production as the A5M.|$|E

50|$|In 1930 the British Air Ministry {{circulated}} a draft {{version of}} Specification F.7/30 for a heavily armed {{day and night}} fighter around likely manufacturers.

As it was expected that <b>the</b> high speeds <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> fighter and its prospective targets would only allow short bursts of fire to hit the target, an armament of four Vickers machine guns was required, double that of earlier fighters. Although not a <b>requirement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification,</b> <b>the</b> Air Ministry encouraged <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new steam-cooled Rolls-Royce Goshawk engine.|$|R

25|$|In 1932, the Air Ministry issued Specification B.9/32 {{seeking a}} twin-engined day bomber with higher {{performance}} than any preceding bomber aircraft.

The design team, led by G.R.
