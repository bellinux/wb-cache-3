5|$|In the 1968 season, Wilhelm {{was getting}} close to {{breaking}} the all-time games pitched record belonging to Cy Young (906 games).

Wilhelm later broke the <b>record</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> relief pitcher. He also set MLB records for consecutive errorless games by a pitcher, career victories in relief, games finished and innings pitched in relief. Despite Wilhelm's success, the White Sox, who had won at least 83 games per season in the 1960s, performed poorly. They finished 1968 with a 67–95 record.|$|E

5|$|Maya stone {{sculpture}} {{emerged into}} the archaeological <b>record</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fully developed tradition, {{suggesting that it}} may have evolved from a tradition of sculpting wood. Because of the biodegradability of wood, the corpus of Maya woodwork has almost entirely disappeared. The few wooden artefacts that have survived include three-dimensional sculptures, and hieroglyphic panels. Stone Maya stelae are widespread in city sites, often paired with low, circular stones referred to as altars in the literature. Stone sculpture also took other forms, such as the limestone relief panels at Palenque and Piedras Negras. At Yaxchilan, Dos Pilas, Copán, and other sites, stone stairways were decorated with sculpture. The hieroglyphic stairway at Copán comprises the longest surviving Maya hieroglyphic text, and consists of 2,200 individual glyphs.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Atlus {{picking up}} the title, Vanillaware had {{encountered}} difficulties finding a publisher due to Kamitani's sparse <b>record</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> developer.

Upon release, it garnered a positive reception from video game journalists: praise was given to its story, visuals and old-school gameplay, with criticism focused on its inventory system and framerate issues. Leifthrasir was praised for its improved performance and reworked mechanics. The game was a commercial success, contributing {{to the rise of}} Vanillaware as a developer.|$|E
