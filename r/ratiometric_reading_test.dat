40|$|Purpose: Measurement {{properties}} of <b>tests</b> to assess <b>reading</b> acuity or reading performance {{have not been}} extensively evaluated. This study aims to {{provide an overview of}} the literature on available continuous text <b>reading</b> <b>tests</b> and their measurement properties. Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase and PsycInfo. Subsequently, information on design and content of <b>reading</b> <b>tests,</b> study design and measurement properties were extracted using consensus-based standards for selection of health measurement instruments. Quality of studies, <b>reading</b> <b>tests</b> and measurement properties were systematically assessed using pre-specified criteria. Results: From 2334 identified articles, 20 relevant articles were found on measurement {{properties of}} three <b>reading</b> <b>tests</b> in various languages: IReST, MNread Reading Test and Radner Reading Charts. All three <b>reading</b> <b>tests</b> scored high on content validity. Reproducibility studies (repeated measurements between different testing sessions) of the IReST and MNread of commercially available <b>reading</b> <b>tests</b> in different languages were missing. The IReST scored best on inter-language comparison, the MNread scored well in repeatability studies (repeated measurements under the same conditions) and the Radner showed good reproducibility in studies. Conclusions: Although in daily practice there are other continuous text <b>reading</b> <b>tests</b> available meeting the criteria of this review, measurement properties were described in scientific studies for only three of them. Of the few available studies, the quality and content of study design and methodology used varied. For <b>testing</b> existing <b>reading</b> <b>tests</b> and the development of new ones, for example in other languages, we make several recommendations, including careful description of patient characteristics, use of objective and subjective lighting levels, good control of working distance, documentation of the number of raters and their training, careful documentation of scoring rules and the use of Bland-Altman analyses or similar for reproducibility and repeatability studies...|$|R

Clinical <b>reading</b> <b>tests</b> have been widely used since Jaeger introduced his test types in 1854. A brief review of the major developments in clinical <b>reading</b> <b>tests</b> is provided, followed by a discussion of some of the main controversies in clinical reading assessment. Data for the Salisbury Eye Evaluation (SEE) study demonstrate that standardised clinical <b>reading</b> <b>tests</b> are highly predictive of reading performance under natural, real world conditions, and that discrepancies between self-reported reading ability and measured reading performance may be indicative of people who are at a pre-clinical stage of disability, but are at risk for progression to clinical disability. If measured reading performance is to continue to increase in importance as a clinical outcome measure, there must be agreement on what should be measured (e. g. speed or comprehension) and how it should be measured (e. g. reading silently or aloud). Perhaps most important, the methods for assessing reading performance and the algorithms for scoring <b>reading</b> <b>tests</b> need to be optimised so that the reliability and responsiveness of <b>reading</b> <b>tests</b> can be improved...|$|R

40|$|In Taiwan, {{a reading}} {{comprehension}} component {{is included in}} the English test of the Senior High Academic Ability Examination (SHAAE) – a national examination which can be regarded as a university entrance examination for students in their final year of senior high. This reading subtest consists of a multiple-choice format. Studies on language assessment, L 2 reading and L 1 -L 2 reading have suggested that EFL students’ performance on multiple-choice <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>tests</b> is attributed to two major factors: English Language Knowledge and Strategy Use. This feature raises a number of issues. Does the multiple-choice reading comprehension subtest of the English component at the SHAAE measure what it is intended to assess? Do Taiwanese senior high school students’ English Language Knowledge and Strategy Use have an effect on their multiple-choice <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>test</b> performance? What are the relative contributions of students’ English Language Knowledge and Strategy Use to their <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>test</b> performance? Is there a language threshold for students’ deploying some strategies to contribute to their <b>reading</b> <b>test</b> performance? The current study sets out to address these issues. It investigates the relationship among Taiwanese senior high school students’ English language knowledge, reading and test-taking strategy use, and their multiple-choice <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>test</b> performance. The findings of the research are connected with: (a) the English language teaching approach for English language teachers in Taiwan; (b) the validity of the reading comprehension subtest of the English component at the SHAAE; and (c) the validity of salient models of language ability. A quantitative research approach is used that involves an ex post-facto correlational research design, utilizing survey methodology. An English Language Knowledge test, a Strategy Use questionnaire, and a multiple-choice <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>test</b> serve as instruments. 1064 EFL students in six senior high schools located in the south region of Taiwan participated in the study. Data was collected in the classroom during English class sessions. Participants took a <b>reading</b> <b>test</b> and completed a Strategy Use questionnaire. Three to seven days later, they sat an English Language Knowledge test. Exploratory factor analysis is conducted to extract components underlying the data collected from instruments. Structural Equation Modeling is applied to examine the relationship among students’ English Language Knowledge, Strategy Use and their <b>reading</b> <b>test</b> performance. The main finding of the study is that Taiwanese senior high school students are strategic readers/test-takers. Their English Language Knowledge and Strategy Use contribute to their <b>reading</b> <b>test</b> performance. However, compared with that of English Language Knowledge, the contribution of students’ Strategy Use to their <b>reading</b> <b>test</b> performance is smaller. In addition, a language threshold is present for students deploying strategies contributing to their <b>reading</b> <b>test</b> performance. In conclusion, the thesis addresses the need for implementing strategy instruction for students to improve their Strategy Use in a <b>reading</b> <b>test</b> and further to promote their <b>reading</b> <b>test</b> performance. The discussion also compares the outcome of the research with other approaches to Reading/Test-taking Strategy Use and current models of Strategic Competence...|$|R

The research aims, among other things, to contribute to our ability to evaluate the cognitive validity of <b>reading</b> <b>test</b> items (Glaser, 1991; Field, in press). The project focused on differences in reading behaviours of successful and unsuccessful candidates while completing IELTS test items. A group of Malaysian undergraduates (n = 71) took an onscreen test consisting of two IELTS reading passages with 11 test items. Eye movements of a random sample of these participants (n = 38) were tracked. Stimulated recall interview data was collected to assist in interpretation of the eye-tracking data. Findings demonstrated significant differences between successful and unsuccessful test takers on a number of dimensions, including their ability to read expeditiously (Khalifa & Weir, 2009), and their focus on particular aspects of the test items and texts, while no observable difference was noted in other items.
