40|$|The Dines {{pressure}} tube anemometer {{was the primary}} wind speed recording instrument used in Australia until it was replaced by Synchrotac cup anemometers in the 1990 s. Simultaneous observations of the gust wind speeds recorded using both types of anemometers during tropical cyclones have, however, {{raised questions about the}} equivalency of the gust wind speeds recorded using the two instruments. An experimental study of the response of both versions of the Dines anemometer used in Australia shows that the response of the anemometer is dominated by the motion of the float manometer used to record the wind speed. The amplitude response function shows the presence of two resonant peaks, with the amplitude and frequency of the peaks depending on the instrument version and the mean wind speed. Comparison of the gust wind speeds recorded using Dines and Synchrotac anemometers using random process and linear system theory shows that, on average, the low-speed Dines <b>anemometer</b> <b>records</b> values 2 %– 5 % higher than those recorded using a Synchrotac anemometer under the same conditions, while the high-speed Dines <b>anemometer</b> <b>records</b> values 3 %– 7 % higher, depending on the mean wind speed and turbulence intensity. These differences are exacerbated with the adoption of the WMO-recommended 3 -s moving average gust wind speed when reporting the Synchrotac anemometer gust wind speeds, rising to 6 %– 12 % and 11 %– 19 % for low- and high-speed Dines anemometers, respectively. These results are consistent with both field observations and an independent extreme value analysis of simultaneously observed gust wind speeds at seven sites in northern Australia...|$|R

40|$|For {{buildings}} and structures in typhoon regions, they must be designed to withstand typhoon winds during their design lives. The determination of design typhoon wind speed for a structure within a given design life thus becomes an imperative task. A refined typhoon wind field model considering the influence of temperature and the variation of central pressure difference with height has been recently proposed by the authors. This paper aims to use this refined typhoon wind field model together with the Monte Carlo simulation and the typhoon wind decay model for predicting design typhoon wind speeds and profiles based on 60 -year typhoon wind field data recorded by the Hong Kong Observatory. Both directional and non-directional design wind speeds of 50 -year return period predicted by the refined typhoon wind field model, the Meng model and the Shapiro model for the Waglan Island of Hong Kong are compared with the statistical ones directly from the wind measurement data <b>recorded</b> by the <b>anemometers</b> installed on the Waglan Island.

40|$|This paper explores how to {{characterize}} nonstationary wind speed {{that can be}} modeled as a deterministic time-varying mean wind speed component plus a stationary random process for the fluctuating wind speed component. The time-varying mean wind speed is naturally extracted from the nonstationary wind data using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The proposed approach is then applied to the wind data <b>recorded</b> by the <b>anemometers</b> installed in the Tsing Ma suspension Bridge during Typhoon Victor to find its time-varying mean wind speed, probability distribution of fluctuating wind speed, wind spectrum, turbulence intensity, and gust factor. The resulting wind characteristics are compared with those obtained by the traditional approach based on a stationary wind model. It is found that most of nonstationary wind data can be decomposed into a time-varying mean wind speed plus a well-behaved fluctuating wind speed admitted as a stationary random process with a Gaussian distribution. The time-varying mean wind speed identified by EMD at a designated intermittency frequency level is more natural than the traditional time-averaged mean wind speed over the certain time interval. The proposed approach can also be applied to stationary wind speed with the same output as obtained by the traditional approach. It is concluded that the proposed approach is more appropriate than the traditional approach for characterizing wind speed. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Several {{workers have}} {{suggested}} that the current flowing to earth through an earthed radio-active collector could, if wind speed was considered, be used to measure the earth's vertical potential gradient. Without measurement of wind speed such a collector has been used to give an approximate estimate of the potential gradient. The present work sets out to show whether, in fact, an accurate estimate of potential gradient can be got from the simultaneous recording of the current flowing to earth from an earthed radio-active collector and wind speed. Records were taken at the Durham University Observatory of the two variables mentioned and were compared with records of potential gradient as measured with a field mill. The records showed agreement, with the results of other workers in-that there was: a highly significant correlation between the collector current and the potential gradient; and in almost all cases; a significant correlation between collector current and wind speed. However, the results showed that no reliable estimate could be got of potential gradient from the other two records. It was found that the errors in such an estimate were about 6 % over short periods (up to three hours) and appreciably greater over longer periods. It is suggested that the apparently random short term errors are due to rapid fluctuations in wind speed which are not accurately <b>recorded</b> on the <b>anemometer</b> because of the smoothing which was necessary. The long term errors are thought to be due to variations in the effective activity of the collector because of contamination {{on the surface of the}} radio-active laminae restricting the emission of radiation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} air quality in the lower Tamar Valley where Bell Bay industrial area, {{one of the most}} important industrial centres in northern Tasmania, is located. The major sources of air emissions in the area include an aluminium smelter (Comalco Aluminium (Bell Bay) Ltd), a ferro alloys plant (Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Co. Pty Ltd, or Temco), and a 2 x 120 MW oil-fired thermal power station. The effects and synergistic effects of the air emissions from these sources on the physical and human environment have been of concern to the local residents, particularly the dairy farmers and orchardists, over the years, yet very few air quality measurements have been made. Thus, an air quality study was undertaken from July 1982 to July 1984, with a view to drawing attention to, and enhancing the understanding of, some of the existing or potential air pollution problems in the area. The study, which is the most extensive and intensive one ever attempted in Tasmania, covered basically two major aspects: meteorological study and ambient air monitoring. A total of six Lambrecht Woelfle (model 1482) continuous <b>recording</b> <b>anemometers</b> was established between Low Head (near the coast) and Dilston (27 km SE of Bell Bay) at a height of 10 -m. Data from December 1982 to November 1983 show that the wind field is strongly influenced by the topography of the valley, which generally has a NW-SE orientation. NW winds occurred most frequently in the afternoons, while the SE winds occurred most frequently in the mornings particularly at locations further up the valley due to the strong influence of the chanelling effects. However, different locations are also subjected to local katabatic winds which occurred most frequently from late night to early morning during the colder months. Of these, the most notable and important ones are the NE katabatic winds originating from the saddle between Mt George and the Tippogoree Hills, and the SW katabatic winds originating from one of the larger side valleys on the western shore, which could spread out and reach the industrial area as light W TO WNW flows if the main valley is calm. The frequency of occurrence of sea breezes was also investigated. They were found to enter the valley more frequently from the NW than N or NE directions. NW sea breezes occurred about one in every three days in summer, one in every five days in spring and autumn, and one in every seven days in winter. Sea breezes could flush and dilute the air pollutants from the Bell Bay industrial area, but could also carry them further up the valley. It is possible that some air pollutants carried off-shore in the morning could be returned to the valley a few hours later by the sea breezes. Atmospheric stability (based on the Pasquill-Turner stability classes) is estimated. In general, the winds with unstable classes A, B, and C occurred more frequently during the late morning to early afternoon for all stations, particularly in warmer months, while those with stable classes E, F, and G occurred more frequently from late night to early morning, particularly during the colder months. The neutral class D was most frequent for all months and could occur at all times of day. The spatial and temporal variations of the atmospheric stability are quite significant, suggesting that it is very much a function of locality and time. The frequency of occurrence of extreme stability conditions (class G) was higher whenever there were more light winds and in more sheltered regions. Limited tethered balloon soundings were performed within the planetary boundary layer from early evening to early morning in September and October 1982 so as to obtain the vertical profiles or structures of temperature and horizontal wind from which the diffusive power of the lower atmosphere may be derived. Many interesting meteorological phenomena, including surface and elevated inversions, wind shear effects, and upstream air blocking were observed in the Bell Bay industrial area. The morning surface inversion layers; sometimes associated with the occurrence of the wind speed maxima, were found to be able to develop up to a height of 200 to 300 m above the ground surface (about 40 m above sea level) of the valley. Elevated inversion at 425 - 530 m was also observed during a sea breeze evening. The wind field appears to be frequently influenced by the local katabatic winds and SE down-valley flows in the mornings at the lower level, and gradient winds 200 m above. NE winds channelled from the saddle between Mt George and the Tippogoree Hills could be blocked by the Asbestos/Dazzler Ranges on the western shore at an elevation of 100 m. Other aspects of meteorological study cover the daily weather observations, in particular, fog and haze smoke occurrences; horizontal. surface temperature mappings for investigating the heat island effects caused by the industrial sources; measurements of air temperature and humidity at the lower (10 m elevation) and upper (180 m elevation) levels for estimating the frequency of occurrence of surface inversions. The implications of air pollution in relation to all the above-mentioned meteorological factors are discussed. The ambient, air monitoring consisted of monthly sampling of bulk (wet and dry) atmospheric deposition, sampling of wet-only deposition based on event rains, regular sampling of suspended particulates, and monitoring of ambient SO 42 -, 03, CO, and NOx (no useful data were obtained for this part of study because of frequent malfunctions of the air analysers). The chemical compositions of the bulk deposition and suspended particulates samples were analysed using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Chemical speciation of some selected precipitation samples was performed using Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) on a trial basis, with some useful results obtained. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Analysis of X-Ray (EDAX) were also used to characterise the chemical elements in some selected suspended particulates samples (using membrane filters) and monthly bulk deposition samples (using cellulose acetate filters). The,mean annual fluxes of total insoluble dust ranged from 32. 4 to 338. 3 mg m- 2 day- 1. For trace elements Al (insoluble), F (soluble), Mn (total) and Fe (insoluble), the mean annual fluxes ranged from 445 to 5 638, 89 to 12 568, 38 to 3 676, and 392 to 1 534 ug m- 2 day- 1 respectively, with the lowest values being the intended 'background' levels. The fluxes of the elements are statistically correlated with each other, hence their sources identified (Al and F from Comalco, Mn from Temco). In general, they were much higher within 3 km of their respective sources. However, the air emissions from the industrial area could travel at least 10 km up the valley. The impact of the deposition rates of the trace elements on the local 'environment and ecosystems are difficult to assess, as no standards are available for comparison. A deposition rate of 100 pig m- 2 day- 1 for gaseous F (as HF for a 30 day period) is adopted by the South Carolina Pollution Control Authority, but the standard. may not be applicable to the lower Tamar Valley unless it was based on similar sampling and analytical techniques. The acidity of the bulk deposition and event rain samples were also investigated. The major acid-producing species,SO 42 -, mainly came from - the thermal power station, though there were some contributions from the metal-smelting industries. About 31...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{wind erosion}} {{processes}} are well described in literature many vul- nerable wind erosion areas as the steppe (Badia) of Jordan {{have not been}} studied extensively. The International Center of Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) {{has an interest in}} estimating wind erosion for different agricultural plots in Jordan. A wind erosion research was car- ried out on a experimental Barley, Water harvesting and Natural grazing plot at Al-Majidyya, (45 km South-East from Amman) Jordan. A mea- surement campaign consisting of a wind tower with five cup anemometers, three Saltation Detectors, a wind vane and 30 Modified Wilson and Cook (MWAC) sediment catchers were established during summer (June-Sept) 2011. No wind erosion storms were <b>recorded</b> by the <b>anemometers</b> (Max wind velocity = 7. 37 m/s) and no saltation was recorded by the Saltation Detectors. The sediment of the MWAC catchers were insufficient for data analysis. The cover and roughness characteristics of the three experimental plots were different, whereby the Water harvesting plot had a higher aero- dynamic roughness (Z 0 ≈ 17 cm) compared to the other two plots (Z 0 ≈ 10 cm) due to the presence of vegetation lines consisting of ridges and shrubs planted in furrows. The ridges on the Barley plot were parallel with the predominant wind direction (West) and therefore no obstacle for the wind. Three datasets were obtained, besides wind and soil data of Al-Majidyya (UU dataset) also weather data from the past of the Al-Muwaqar and Queen Alia Airport (Amman) stations were provided. A detailed historical wind analysis in combination with wind velocity comparisons were made. Accord- ing to ICARDA and The National Center for Agricultural Research and Ex- tension (NCARE),the wind erosion storm season was from June-September, however the historical wind analysis showed a potential wind erosion season from October-March. The Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ) model was used to estimate mass transport and soil losses for each experimental plot. Four periods of the translated Al-Muwaqar dataset were selected and used in the RWEQ Model. These selected periods were {{based on the number of}} potential wind erosion days whereby U 2 > Uthreshold. This resulted in four periods from January- March of the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2011. The Barley and Natural graz- ing plot showed the highest mass transport rates, Q(x) barley = 0 − 3. 0 (kg/m) and Q(x) Naturalgrazing = 0 − 1. 0 (kg/m) for the potential wind erosion pe- riod of ≈ 10 days in 2002. However the Jan-March period of 2004 showed the highest average mass transport rate per 10 minute timestep, meaning that for a valid period of 5 days already a Q(x) barley = 0 − 1. 86 (kg/m) was obtained. The Barley plot was the most erodible plot followed by the Natu- ral grazing plot which was a third of the wind erosion quantities compared to the Barley plot due to lower erodible soil factors. However the Water harvesting plot showed almost no wind erosion due to the low Combined Crop factor caused by the vegetation lines. The wind erosion quantities of the Water harvesting plot were > 90 % reduced compared to the quantities of the Barley and Natural grazing plot...|$|R
40|$|In 2013, the Norwegian {{government}} {{adopted an}} ambitious plan {{to cross the}} wide and deep-fjords of Western Norway and create a ferry-free coastal high- way route. This implies the construction of multiple long-span bridges (even up to 5 km long) and in particular long-span suspension bridges. Because of their size and lightness, such structures will be particularly sensitive to environmental effects including wind turbulence. Yet, there are only relatively few studies available on wind effects on long-span bridges in full-scale and in complex terrains. Sonic anemometers ﬁxed to a measurement mast on land are traditionally utilized to monitor wind turbulence. Recent development of remote wind sensing technologies can introduce a complementary tool for mapping the ﬂow over several kilometres wide fjords, more representative of the future bridge exposure. These challenges are addressed in the present thesis by studying the wind- induced vibrations of an existing suspension bridge, in full-scale. The Lyse- fjord Bridge, located in South-Western Norway {{is used as a}} case study. Since November 2013, it has been instrumented with multiple sonic anemometers and accelerometers. During spring 2014, two short measurement campaigns were conducted with single and dual Doppler wind lidar systems to assess their capabilities in capturing the turbulence characteristics relevant to bridge design. This thesis is structured around three main axes that are central for a systematic validation of the buffeting theory in full-scale. Firstly, a detailed investigation of the ﬂow conditions at the bridge site is performed, by utilizing both the data from the anemometers and the Doppler Wind lidars. Secondly, the modal parameters of the Lysefjord Bridge are identiﬁed by using an operational modal analysis. Thirdly, the buffeting response of the Lysefjord Bridge is evaluated. Discussion focuses on the sources of the discrepancies between the measured and the computed responses, selected for a detailed comparison. Sonic <b>anemometer</b> <b>records</b> document two main wind directions (N-NE and S-SW) on the bridge site. The turbulence properties of the ﬂow are characteristically different for these two main wind directions, so that a case-by-case approach is necessary to study the statistics of wind turbulence. The application of a single long-range pulsed wind lidar 1. 75 km west of the bridge illustrated the potential of a wind lidar to capture single-point statistics of wind turbulence at distances larger than 1 km. However, a multi-lidar conﬁguration is needed for a more complete survey of turbulence. In particular, the deployment of the short-range WindScanner system on the bridge deck demonstrated the potential of dual-wind lidar systems to measure the coherence of wind. When it comes to structural health monitoring of the Lysefjord Bridge, a time-efﬁcient automated covariance-driven stochastic subspace identiﬁcation method was applied on six months of continuous bridge acceleration records. Results from this modal identiﬁcation procedure have highlighted the dependency of the eigen-frequencies and modal damping ratios of the bridge deck on the wind velocity and temperature ﬂuctuations. The good agreement between the measured and computed modal parameters has been identiﬁed, which allowed a detailed comparison of the measured response with the computed one in the frequency domain. Discrepancies larger than expected were observed for the standard deviation of the lateral and the vertical bridge displacement response for the N-NE exposure. The differences may be attributed to various factors, including the inﬂuence of the topography on the ﬂow properties and the possible disturbance of the observed ﬂow ﬁeld by the bridge deck...|$|R
