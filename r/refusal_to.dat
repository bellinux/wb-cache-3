40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the {{antitrust}} intellectual property conflict. The former promotes competition by prohibiting monopolies that harm competition, while the latter promotes competition by granting monopolies. This paper focuses on <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> deal in intellectual property rights as violation of antitrust law. The paper explores <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> deal as monopolistic conduct in antitrust law and relates this with <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> deal in intellectual property rights. The paper concludes with an analysis of the success rate of antitrust scrutiny of intellectual property rights...|$|R

5|$|As the {{campaign}} progressed, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the Republicans {{did in the}} face of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland was {{the first}} Democratic President subject to the Tenure of Office Act which {{originated}} in 1867; the act purported to require the Senate to approve the dismissal of any presidential appointee who was originally subject to its advice and consent. Cleveland objected to the act in principle and his steadfast <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> abide by it prompted its fall into disfavor and led to its ultimate repeal in 1887.|$|E

40|$|An {{agreement}} among competitors {{to refuse to}} deal with another party is traditionally per se illegal under the antitrust laws. But coordinated <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> deal are often necessary to punish wrongdoers, and thus to deter undesirable behavior that state-sponsored courts cannot reach. When viewed as a mechanism to govern transactions and induce socially desirable cooperative behavior, coordinated <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> deal can sustain valuable reputation mechanisms. This paper employs institutional economics to understand the role of coordinated <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> deal in merchant circles and to evaluate the economic desirability of permitting such coordinated actions among competitors. It concludes that if the objective of antitrust law is to promote economic efficiency, then per se treatment-or any heightened presumption of illegality-of reputation mechanisms with coordinated punishments is misplaced...|$|R

5|$|In June 2011, Devlin {{confirmed}} {{that he and}} Emmerich had written a treatment for two sequels to form a trilogy; both expressed the desire for Will Smith to return. In October 2011, however, discussions over Smith returning were halted, due to Fox's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> provide the $50 million salary demanded by Smith for the two sequels. Emmerich, however, made assurances that the films would be shot back-to-back, regardless of Smith's involvement.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates refusal {{strategies}} on Facebook among {{primary school}} children. Based on a Discourse Completion Test (DCT) which has twelve situations, thirty school-going children aged between 11 and 12 years old were asked <b>to</b> construct <b>refusals</b> {{for the various}} situations given. For this study, a group of 30 {{students were asked to}} respond to the situations where <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> requests, <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> suggestions, <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> invitations and <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> offers were made. The study aims to explore the types of refusal strategies frequently used by primary school children and what strategies are most revealed in the response <b>to</b> <b>refusals</b> used in the situations given within different settings such as family, formal and social. The data were analyzed and categorized according <b>to</b> the <b>refusal</b> taxonomy by Beebe, Takahashi and Uliss-Weltz (1990). It is found that these primary school children employed more indirect strategies compared to the direct strategies. The high frequency in the use of indirect strategies demonstrates that the subjects were aware of the fact that the use of indirect strategies lessens the face-threatening effect of the speech act of refusals. In fact the indirect strategies, “statement of alternative” enjoyed the highest frequency in the family settings while the indirect strategies “excuse, reasons and explanation” enjoyed the highest frequency in the formal and social settings. Finally, the possible justifications behind the variations in the productions of refusals are discussed. Key words: speech act, refusals, family settings, formal setting, social setting...|$|R
40|$|There are {{well-known}} {{circumstances under}} which unilateral <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> license will cause harm to competition, that is, will lower consumer welfare. However, when the strategy is profitable, <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> license also increase the returns to intellectual property, and thus limitations on them will reduce the incentives for firms to invest in innovation. The optimal balance between innovation incentives and protection against static monopoly harm is not knowable to any reasonable degree of precision. Economists {{may be able to}} identify some special cases in which the desired rule is unambiguously knowable, but these cases will be few...|$|R
