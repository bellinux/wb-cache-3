5|$|R.E.M. put Sweet {{in touch}} with Easter, who wrote Sweet a number of long letters, and {{suggested}} he move to Athens {{after graduating from high}} school. Meanwhile, Stipe <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> Sweet's tape, and he also played it for his sister, Lynda, and friend Linda Hopper, who were both in the band Oh-OK. All three sent Sweet postcards saying he should come perform in Athens, with Lynda and Linda inviting him to open for Oh-OK there. Sweet told his parents that he wanted to study at the University of Georgia, in Athens. Within weeks of moving there, he had become a member of Oh-OK, who recorded their EP Furthermore What in August 1983 with him on board. While a member of Oh-OK, Sweet also began collaborating with Michael Stipe as the band Community Trolls.|$|E
25|$|In August 2016, Rogen again {{spoke to}} Howard Stern {{about how he}} had felt hurt and {{somewhat}} betrayed back then by Heigl's comments. He went on {{to talk about what}} a great rapport they'd had on set while working together, and that at the time he had even envisioned making many more movies with her. Though Rogen wishes she would have apologized to him personally as opposed to publicly, he affirmed that he still <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> her, and that he never would have wanted the incident to hurt her career.|$|E
25|$|Streets of Fire {{began in}} the {{euphoria}} of knowing that Paramount <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> 48 {{and wanted to be}} in business with us if they could. What happened was that after we screened that cut for Paramount, Larry looked at Walter and said, “Paramount is pregnant; let’s get something and set it up right away.” Walter knew what he meant—that we were in a great position here—so he said, “We can do this two ways: present an idea now and get a deal done, or write a script on spec and get a lot more money.” Walter proudly considers himself a capitalist, so he suggested we do the latter.|$|E

25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, {{very aware}} of {{what they wanted to}} do. They wanted {{to get away from the}} jazz scene of the early '50s, which was the Birdland scene—you hire Phil Woods or Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E
500|$|Francis {{reflected}} in 2004 {{that during the}} recording of the group's second album Doolittle he felt embarrassed by [...] "Here Comes Your Man", but since producer Gil Norton <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> the song, the songwriter [...] "threw him a bone". Norton recorded the band performing the song's backing track when Black Francis was not available. The song featured a different arrangement from previous recordings of the track, and Black Francis added another verse to it.|$|E

500|$|In {{producing}} Vulture Street, Powderfinger {{moved in}} a different direction to their previous works, especially Odyssey Number Five, starting with opening song [...] "Rockin' Rocks", which was written according to Middleton after [...] "a couple of months trying really hard to write this new rock album" [...] but not making anything they <b>really</b> <b>liked.</b> He also said the band could easily have written lots of [...] "The Metre"-like songs, but didn't do that [...] "for our own interest in the band and music".|$|E
500|$|... "Britney" [...] is an {{inspirational}} ballad with elements of folk music, that lasts {{for three minutes}} and thirty-four seconds long. Josh Taylor of Jesus Freak Hideout compared its structure to [...] "Hey There Delilah" [...] by the Plain White T's. The song was released on July 28, 2008 as a digital single on iTunes Store, {{two months before the}} official release of Norman's album.

500|$|He {{also makes}} a cameo {{appearance}} in the 2008 Silent Hill comic book Sinner's Reward, published by IDW Publishing. The writer, Tom Waltz, later said he regretted the cameo, which only functioned as fan service. To him, Pyramid Head is a psychological construct created for James; however, he stated that: [...] "At the same time, I don't think that ruined the comic. Some people <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> it. To some people, Pyramid Head should be in all the stories because they do like him." [...] Additionally, the character was portrayed from October 2 to 31, 2009, in the haunted attraction Sinister Pointe, based on Silent Hill, in Orange County, California, United States.|$|E
500|$|In The Curse of Monkey Island, Elaine realises that Guybrush is {{her true}} love, and marries him.

Gilbert was not involved in the production of The Curse of Monkey Island; while thinking that the new development team [...] "did {{a pretty good job of}} capturing [...] what Monkey Island was about", the relationship between Elaine and Guybrush [...] "was the thing that bugged [...] the most about The Curse of Monkey Island".|$|E
500|$|One of his {{earliest}} conversations on the film's casting {{was with the}} actress Jennifer Aniston. She was talking about actors she had worked with who she loved, and two of her favorites were Gyllenhaal (The Good Girl) and Mark Ruffalo (Rumor Has It).

Buchanan told Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian {{that she made}} advances towards the man, but {{he was unaware of}} her intentions: [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> this guy, so I'd be like, there's this good movie coming out, you know, dropping hints.

500|$|Computer-generated imagery {{was used}} in much of [...] "Days Gone Bye", {{particularly}} when Rick encounters a legless walker. [...] "The woman was wearing basically blue stockings and then everything was cleaned out. There is an alarming amount of CGI in the pilot episode and in the whole show, and you would never know it," [...] articulated Robert Kirkman. Kirkman felt that Stargate Studios, which was chosen by producers to edit the pilot episode, did a splendid job. He stated: [...] "There's a shot where Rick is riding off on the horse and his hat actually blew off, and they <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> that shot, and so they had Stargate go in and digitally put the hat back on his head." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] is a cover song {{recorded}} by British singer-songwriter Leona Lewis for her second studio album Echo (2009). Originally written by Noel Gallagher of rock band Oasis, {{the song was}} produced by Lewis and Steve Robson. [...] Lewis decided to cover the track as she {{is a fan of}} Oasis and rock bands in general, and she <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> the song's sentiment. The strings were performed by London Session Orchestra, who were organised and arranged by Will Malone. The musical structure of the song is different from the conventional style which is normally used, as the song's melody does not gain momentum {{until the end of the}} song instead of by the first chorus.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} the show came from Conan O'Brien, who thought of Marge getting {{a job at the}} power plant and that Mr. Burns has a crush on her. The animators had trouble animating Marge with the suit and lipstick. Director Jeff Lynch said there were a few scenes where Marge [...] "looks like a monster". All the jargon used by Troy McClure was {{accurately}} taken from a Time–Life foundation repair book. The original subplot for the episode was Mr. Burns telling Homer to dress up as Mister Atom and have him go to schools to talk to the children. The cast <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> Tom Jones as a guest star. They said he was fun to work with, and was really nice, and even offered to perform a concert after he was done recording lines.|$|E

After she played the song to her publisher, they met with Spears and her A Teresa LaBarbera Whites, who both loved it. Morier described [...] "Heaven on Earth" [...] as the song that transformed her career. Spears reportedly found [...] "Heaven on Earth" [...] difficult to record due to the songs' romantic lyrics since she had filed for divorce from Federline months prior, but she <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> the track and still wanted to record it despite her loneliness.|$|E
