5|$|As the <b>riders</b> {{entered the}} flat lands near the Belgian coast, the winds became more problematic. Around {{three-quarters of the}} peloton had been dropped or had {{withdrawn}} from the race {{by the time the}} <b>riders</b> turned back inland. Gert Steegmans (Trek Factory Racing) was blown sideways into a ditch; the wind knocked several other <b>riders</b> over and caused Martin Velits (Etixx-Quick Step) and Lars Bak (Lotto-Soudal) to withdraw from the race. Mark Cavendish crashed and was forced to chase to attempt to rejoin the leading <b>riders.</b> The conditions were so severe that some team officials called for the race to be neutralised to ensure the riders' safety. Shortly afterwards, two large groups came back together. The main peloton was therefore made up of around 100 <b>riders</b> and was approximately two minutes behind the breakaway. The breakaway was caught soon afterwards.|$|E
