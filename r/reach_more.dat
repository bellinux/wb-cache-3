5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and urban planning activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and environmental management, but has not {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves reordering the chain of events in the production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to <b>reach</b> <b>more</b> efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. beginning in 1974; the earliest schematics in the service manual are from June 1974, while the last is from November. The schematics bear the logos of both Atari and Kee Games, a subsidiary company set up by Atari in 1973 in order to <b>reach</b> <b>more</b> distributors, which was merged with Atari in December 1974. The game was announced and shown at the Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition on November 1–3, 1974, for release that month. It was then advertised in the December 7 issue of Cash Box.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus had {{a massive}} skull that could <b>reach</b> <b>more</b> than 1meter (3.3ft) in length. The bones were heavily {{constructed}} and some, including the nasal bones {{on top of}} the snout, were fused for strength. Large fenestrae (openings) in the skull reduced its weight. An adult Daspletosaurus was armed with about six dozen teeth that were very long but oval in cross section rather than blade-like. Unlike its other teeth, those in the premaxilla {{at the end of the}} upper jaw had a D-shaped cross section, an example of heterodonty always seen in tyrannosaurids. Unique skull features included the rough outer surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the pronounced crests around the eyes on the lacrimal, postorbital, and jugal bones. The orbit (eye socket) was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus. Split carinae have been found on Daspletosaurus teeth.|$|E

5|$|The giraffe's neck {{vertebrae}} have {{ball and}} socket joints. In particular, the atlas–axis joint (C1 and C2) allows the animal to tilt its head vertically and <b>reach</b> <b>more</b> branches with the tongue. The point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie {{between the first and}} second thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T2), unlike most other ruminants where the articulation is between the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) and T1. This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra cervical vertebra. However, this proposition is not generally accepted, as T1 has other morphological features, such as an articulating rib, deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebrae, and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebrae are generally characterised by increased neurological anomalies and maladies.|$|E
5|$|Moncton has a {{warm summer}} {{continental}} climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with uniform precipitation distribution. Winter days are typically cold but generally sunny with solar radiation generating some warmth. Daytime high temperatures usually range {{a few degrees}} below the freezing point. Major snowfalls can result from nor'easter ocean storms moving up {{the east coast of}} North America. These major snowfalls typically average 20–30cm (8–12in) and are frequently mixed with rain or freezing rain. Spring is frequently delayed because the sea ice that forms in the nearby Gulf of St. Lawrence during the previous winter requires time to melt, and this will cool onshore winds, which can extend inland as far as Moncton. The ice burden in the gulf has diminished considerably {{over the course of the}} last decade (which may be a consequence of global warming), and the springtime cooling effect has weakened as a result. Daytime temperatures above freezing are typical by late February. Trees are usually in full leaf by late May. Summers are hot and humid due to the seasonal prevailing westerly winds strengthening the continental tendencies of the local climate. Daytime highs sometimes <b>reach</b> <b>more</b> than 30°C (86°F). Rainfall is generally modest, especially in late July and August, and periods of drought are not uncommon. Autumn daytime temperatures remain mild until late October. First snowfalls usually do not occur until late November and consistent snow cover on the ground does not happen until late December. The Fundy coast of New Brunswick occasionally experiences the effects of post-tropical storms. The stormiest weather of the year, with the greatest precipitation and the strongest winds, usually occurs during the fall/winter transition (November to mid-January).|$|E

25|$|Carbon dioxide sinks {{that store}} {{carbon dioxide in}} the Earth's crust by injecting it into the subsurface, or in the form of {{insoluble}} carbonate salts (mineral sequestration), are considered carbon negative. This is because they are removing carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering it indefinitely and presumably for a considerable duration (thousands to millions of years). However, Carbon Capture technology remains, at best, theoretical and is yet to <b>reach</b> <b>more</b> than 33% efficiency. Furthermore, this process could be rapidly undone, for example by earthquakes or mining.|$|E

25|$|A lifting-body {{spacecraft}} {{would have}} several advantages over other shapes. With higher lift characteristics during flight {{through the atmosphere}} while returning from orbit, the spacecraft can <b>reach</b> <b>more</b> land area, {{and the number of}} available landing opportunities to specific sites would be increased. Deceleration loading during entry would be limited to about 1.5 G. This is important when returning sick, injured, or deconditioned Space Station crew members to Earth. Wheeled runway landings would be possible, permitting simple, precision recovery at many sites around the world, including the Kennedy Space Center launch site.|$|E
25|$|The {{small number}} of {{stations}} means that the Carmelit serves {{only a small part}} of Haifa – which was the important population and business center at the time it was designed. Nowadays, the vast majority of Haifa's population does not live close to any of the stations, making it very lightly used. There have been talks of extending its tunnels to <b>reach</b> <b>more</b> population centers, but such an extension has not been done, primarily for fiscal reasons. The most widely used public transportation system in Haifa is Egged buses, which cover most of the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} Portadown {{is like that}} {{of much of the}} rest of the UK and Ireland, being a {{temperate}} oceanic climate. It has mild temperatures throughout the year, with summer temperatures not reaching levels to be deemed very hot and winter not very cold. Summer temperatures can <b>reach</b> <b>more</b> than 20°C though it is rare for them to go higher than 30°C (86°F). The consistently humid climate that prevails over Ireland can make these temperatures feel uncomfortable when they stray into the high 20's °C (80–85°F), more so than similar temperatures in hotter climates in the rest of Europe. It also receives a steady amount of rainfall throughout the year.|$|E
