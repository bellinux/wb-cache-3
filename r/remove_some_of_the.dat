Cutscenes were edited to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> violence, such as William Turner threatening {{to commit suicide}} while aiming a gun at his neck, as in the film. Unlike the Japanese version, the undead pirates do not catch fire when affected by Fire magic, and their muskets were modified to resemble crossbows, though the crossbows still fire with an audible musket shot sound effect.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the first}} pieces of {{legislation}} passed by the new Congress under Gingrich was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which subjected members of Congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As a provision of the Contract with America, the law was symbolic of the new Republican majority's goal to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and {{was signed into law}} on January 23, 1995.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} well {{organized}} for defense, {{and in the}} Battle for Brest Middleton's units went about capturing it methodically. The defense {{of the city was}} under German Generalleutnant Hermann Ramcke with whom Middleton carried on a dialog during the siege. Ramcke sent Middleton a map showing where several hundred American prisoners were being held in the city, but also slyly placed on the map a number of red crosses where the Allies knew some good bombing targets were located, such as ammunition depots. Middleton wrote back to Ramcke telling him to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bogus red crosses, or some terms of the Geneva Convention might have to be ignored. Middleton also reminded Ramcke of the Allies' superior artillery and air power.|$|E

5|$|Seeking to {{circumvent}} this obstacle, Pyrrhus sent {{a force of}} 2,000 Gauls and some picked Chaonians under the commander of his son Ptolemy {{to go around the}} trench. These troops found their path blocked by the wagons which the Lacedaimonians had sunken into the soil. The wagons were planted so deeply that they hindered not only the Epiriote assault but also Spartan efforts to repel the foray. Eventually the Gauls managed to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wagons, giving them the opportunity to burst into the city. Acrotatus, seeing the danger, exploited a series of depressions in the terrain to lead a force of 300 men undetected against the Epiriote rear. This manoeuvre evoked panic amongst the Gauls who were compelled to abandon their attempt to enter the city and had to turn around to confront the attack to their rear. After a hard fought battle, the Epiriote flanking group was pushed back into the trench with heavy casualties inflicted upon them. The Spartans, elated by Arcotatus' leadership, told him to withdraw from the battle and return to Chilonis so as to beget more children like him for Sparta.|$|E

25|$|There {{was also}} intense {{pressure}} from the Soviet government {{to open up a}} second front in Western Europe. By early 1942, the Wehrmacht's Operation Barbarossa had clearly failed to destroy the Soviet Union. However, the Germans in a much less ambitious summer offensive launched in June were deep into southern Soviet territory, pushing toward Stalingrad. Joseph Stalin himself repeatedly demanded that the Allies create a second front in France to force the Germans to move at least 40 divisions away from the Eastern Front to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pressure on the Red Army.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrival of}} the Civil War in 1861 took its toll on the library {{collection}}.

The library {{was used as a}} hospital and much of the library's collection was lost during this time. After the war, the building was sold to a private owner who planned to turn the building into a private residence and asked the library to remove {{what was left of the}} collection. Funds continued to be hard to come by and in 1879, the Library Company closed. The remainder of its collection was stored in Peabody Hall.|$|E
25|$|On June 17, 2008, the {{university}} once again hired contractors to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protesters' platforms, lines, and other infrastructure. The operation was started {{the day before}} a final ruling on the athletic center was expected {{in order to prevent}} more protesters from ascending the trees once the ruling was announced. One protester was removed from the trees and arrested after she allegedly bit one of the contractors. She was charged with assault, battery, resisting arrest, providing false information, trespassing and refusing to leave. One contractor was punched twice in the face during the operation. The protesters threw human urine and feces at the contractors and police throughout the day. Despite the actions of {{the university}}, about a dozen protesters remained in the grove.|$|E
25|$|The stains or mineral powder (such as Hematite) are earth {{colors in}} various hues of brown, black, green, and blue. These colors are also accented by the {{original}} colors of the clay (red, white, or gray) to provide a further rich texture. After the stain {{is applied to the}} ceramic piece, Al-Zahawi would use a cloth with turpentine to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stain and reveal the texture of clay and patterns of the rib tool. The stain is then protected by a transparent wax that has limited shine but nevertheless allows the colors and shades of the stain and the rich texture to become more pronounced. Al-Zahawi has also experimented with engraving designs on the surface of certain sculptures to bring out a particular area or special form. With staining versus glazing, these engravings are extenuated and truly give the art a unique and exotic feel.|$|E

25|$|The four-game homestand {{concluded}} with a Sunday afternoon national TV game against arch-rivals New York Red Bulls. Despite a pre-game shower during warm-ups and with inclement weather approaching, the teams kicked off on time, but the game was stopped just shy of the 8:00 mark, because a powerful storm was about to settle over RFK. After the torrential rains eased somewhat, grounds-crew tried to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bigger puddles of water and play resumed after a delay of {{about an hour and}} a quarter. Despite epically sloppy conditions, United was able to create some excellent chances to score, but their finishing was not up to the task. NYRB punished the home team's mistakes when Bradley Wright-Phillips finished off a play that opened up when Franklin whiffed on an attempted clearance due to poor footing. The visitors extended their lead in the second half on a shot by Felipe. As the team had done 2 weeks earlier, a desperate United team was able to rally to gain a home draw. First, Marcelo Sarvas scored on a penalty kick, earned by Lloyd Sam, who was playing against his old team for the first time. The tying goal was scored on a header by Patrick Mullins after Birnbaum headed a long corner kick back into the box. With a mid-week trip to Montreal looming, United were clinging to the final post-season slot, holding a tiebreaker edge over Orlando City SC.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, R. G. Harrison, a {{professor}} of anatomy, used a portable x-ray machine {{to get a better}} look at the internal structures of the mummy to better determine age and cause of death of Tutankhamun. One of the most abnormal findings was the sternum (breastbone) and most parts of the frontal ribs were missing. Removing these bones was not part of the normal mummification process, which led Harrison to believe they might have been removed because they were badly damaged before his death. Harrison quickly discovered that Carter was not as careful as many of his personal notes had claimed. The mummy was not re-wrapped after 1926, which led to more deterioration due to the extremely hot external elements over the forty-two years. Also many of the limbs had been amputated in the body in order to <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jewellery. Both hands were cut off, both legs were removed from the pelvis, and the head was severed from the body in order to get the mask off. Even more remarkable is the king's right ear and penis were missing, but photographs from Carter show they were both present during his examination. Harrison believed the slight curve in the spine and small bone fragments might have been the result of the embalming process. The lesion on the left jaw showed signs of healing occurred before his death and one of his legs had been broken, but it could not be determined if it happened naturally or as a result of the embalming or Carter's examination. The fact that skull fragments were discovered led many to assume the king was murdered by a blow to the head, but the x-ray could not support or discredit this theory.|$|E
500|$|As {{recalled}} {{in the book}} DisneyWar, Eisner asked [...] "Why {{does it have to}} cost so much?" [...] Bruckheimer replied, [...] "Your competition is spending $150 million," [...] referring to franchises like The Lord of the Rings and The Matrix. Eisner concurred, but with the stigma attached to theme-park adaptations, Eisner requested Verbinski and Bruckheimer <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more overt references to the ride in the script, such as a scene where Sparrow and Turner enter the cave via a waterfall.|$|E

500|$|By the 1880s, the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art became {{concerned}} {{about the condition of}} Plas Mawr, and [...] in 1887 Lord Mostyn agreed to lease the building to the Academy for use as their headquarters. The architects Arthur and Herbert Baker were commissioned to survey the building, conduct repairs and <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post-17th century alterations, and J. R. Furness then carried out conservation work on much of the plasterwork. The Victoria Gallery was built onto the north-west side of the house to hold artistic exhibitions, and a weather vane was added {{to the top of the}} building to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.|$|E
500|$|Given {{the legal}} system's {{affirmation}} of its position, the SP began to forcibly <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> settlers. Their agents {{would attempt to}} serve eviction notices, but often would not find anyone at home, as homeowners knew they were coming. In these cases, the agents then tried removing the furniture from the homes, but the Settler's League would just put the furniture back after the agents' departure. Finally, it escalated to {{the point at which}} the agents would then disassemble the houses, but again, volunteers would just put them back together. The settlers were not above their own brand of justice, either. People who had purchased land from those forced to sell would be harassed by locals, and in one case one farmer who had aligned with the SP had his house burned down. Those supporting the railroads tended to be wealthier than the others, deriding the Settler's League as [...] "a set of demagogues" [...] who were [...] "very anxious to get something for nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|Whilst {{the reform}} did <b>remove</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peculiarities of the Stalinist era, [...] the overall impact of program created {{additional}} {{problems for the}} Soviet worker. In many areas, large variations in wages continued to exist. In engineering, for example, factory managers often ignored wage directives to try to encourage workers into roles that had lost much of their attraction after basic wages were cut to match pay throughout an area. Managers would therefore offer higher wages to new trainees. This {{had the effect of}} encouraging some to take a high-paid training position and then leave for a new training position upon qualification. In coal mining, managers had long held the ability to vary wages based on local considerations, such as geological factors or hazard levels, and after the reform they continued to vary wages through manipulation of quotas or rates to protect workers' wages. [...] A further problem with a centrally directed bonus system was that it encouraged factories to continue producing well established, more familiar products because it was far easier to overfulfill targets on familiar products than to start work on new items.|$|E
