40|$|GOAL: To {{determine}} the normality per age {{group of the}} "Echelle du Handicap lié aux Troubles de l'Equilibre et aux Vertiges" (EHTEV) French version of the "Dizziness Handicap Inventory" (DHI) and to assess the effect of sex on the scores and the <b>reproductibility.</b> SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The normative scores {{and the effect of}} the sex were determined in a group of 120 subjects without any instability disorder. Sixty-three women and 57 men, aged 20 - 79 years were graded by age section of 10 years. After 8 - 10 weeks the same questionnaire was submitted again to 47 individuals of this same group to assess the <b>reproductibility.</b> RESULTS: The scores of the instability showed that handicap increased with the age. The mean score for the 50 - 79 year-old group is almost four times greater that of the 20 - 49 years old. Correlation between scores and age is 0. 70 for physical handicap, 0. 76 for emotional handicap, 0. 69 functional handicap and 0. 83 for global score. There is no significant influence of sex. The <b>reproductibility</b> coefficient is 0. 98. CONCLUSION: The scores of the EHTEV increase with age.

Aim: The main goal {{of this paper was}} to establish the role of pure-tone audiometry and evoked transient otoacoustic emissions in the detection of small temporary auditory changes after exposure to high sound pressure levels. Study Design: a cross-sectional cohort study. Material and Methods: 30 otologically normal subjects aged between 20 and 35 years were submitted to pure-tone audiometry and evoked transiente otoacoustic emissions before and after 5 hours of exposure to high sound pressure levels (betweeen 80 and 90 dB). Results: For pure-tone audiometry the largest changes occurred at high frequencies - from 3 KHz to 8 KHz after exposure. The evoked transient otoacoustic emissions showed reduced <b>reproductibility</b> from 1 KHz to 4 KHz after exposure to noise. Conclusion: We noted that both puretone audiometry and evoked transient otoacoustic emissions had a role in detecting statistically significant changes in the auditory threshold and in <b>reproductibility,</b> after exposure to high sound pressure levels...|$|E
