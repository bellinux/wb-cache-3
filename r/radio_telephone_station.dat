5000|$|After Westinghouse {{had chosen}} the {{engineer}} and station manager of the station, Charles B. Popenoe and his assistant engineer, George Blitzoitis, Westinghouse had to choose an announcer. Tommy was chosen for the position even though, like {{the other people in}} the studio, had no experience in radio. [...] "On a day in 1921 Tommy was told {{to go up to the}} roof, to the shack. They were going to try to [...] "make this thing talk". [...] He basically started from scratch and learned as things came his way. It was alleged that the first words uttered on the air waves by Cowan was “ You are listening to the <b>radio</b> <b>telephone</b> broadcasting <b>station,</b> WJZ, in Newark, N.J.”. He later repeated those same words several times not knowing if anyone was tuning in but later admitted that he doubted that anyone was actually listening.|$|R
2500|$|In Jerusalem, the British held several {{strategically}} located security zones named [...] "Bevingrads", at its centre. The city's <b>radio</b> <b>station,</b> <b>telephone</b> {{exchange and}} government hospital were located there, {{along with a}} number of barracks and the Notre Dame hostel, which dominated the city. One of the main objectives of Operation Kilshon was to take control of these zones of strategic importance while the British withdrew. On 13 May the Haganah extended its control of the Old City's Jewish Quarter and on 14th (having obtained the precise schedule of the evacuation with British complicity) took control of the Bevingrads, including the central post office and the Russian Church compound at 04:00. They surprised the Arab troops, who offered no resistance.|$|R

They first took control of the Police lines and disarmed 500 police personnel. The CO then spread out his forces and set up outposts at the Town Police HQ, VHF <b>Radio</b> <b>Station,</b> <b>Telephone</b> exchange and District school, and disabled the phone and telegraph lines. By 26 March 6 am a curfew imposed and the town was calm for the next 48 hours. Some of the police managed to escape on 28 March and join the EPR at Chuadanga.|$|R

5000|$|The Bing Crosby holiday {{perennial}} [...] "White Christmas," [...] {{which appeared}} {{every year on}} the Billboard charts from 1942 to 1962, {{became the center of}} controversy upon the album's release, with calls by the song's composer Irving Berlin to have the song, and the entire album, banned from radio airplay. After hearing Presley's version of his song, which Berlin saw as a [...] "profane parody of his cherished yuletide standard", he ordered his staff in New York to <b>telephone</b> <b>radio</b> <b>stations</b> across the United States, demanding the song be discontinued from radio play. While most US radio stations ignored Berlin's request, at least one disc jockey was fired for playing a song from the album, and most Canadian stations refused to play the album.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1940, Hitler invaded Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. There had been growing concern in Alaska over the lack of {{military}} defense, as a territory vulnerable to Axis invasion. Gruening had been pushing for defense facilities in Alaska since his appointment to the governorship, and because of Hitler's actions, Congress designated funds to build army forts and airfields in the territory. By 1941, there were 3,000 American soldiers stationed around Alaska. With the attack on Pearl Harbor, Gruening prepared for Alaska to be next. Plans were made for black-outs and civilian defense forces whose first assignment was [...] "around-the-clock protection for <b>radio</b> <b>stations,</b> <b>telephone</b> exchanges, oil tanks, public utilities, and docks, and to be vigilant against possible sabotage." [...] The Armed Forces expanded their operations in Alaska, slowly moving toward the Aleutian Chain, the most accessible route from Asia. The Japanese did reach Alaska in June 1942, bombing Dutch Harbor and landing on the islands of Attu and Kiska.|$|R
40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} field (EMF) levels generated by mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>radio</b> base <b>stations</b> (RBS) situated on rural-agricultural lands were assessed {{in order to}} evaluate the exposure of farm workers in the surrounding area. The expected EMF at various distances from a mobile telephone RBS was calculated using an ad hoc numerical forecast model. Subsequently, the electric fields around some RBS on agricultural lands were measured, {{in order to obtain}} a good approximation of the effective conditions at the investigated sites. The viability of this study was tested according to the Italian Regulations concerning general and occupational public exposure to time-varying EMFs. The calculated E-field values were obtained with the RBS working constantly at full power, but during the in situ measurements the actual power emitted by RBS antennas was lower than the maximum level, and the E-field values actually registered were much lower than the calculated values...|$|R
