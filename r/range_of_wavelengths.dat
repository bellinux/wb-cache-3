5|$|The eyes of tadpoles lack lids, but at metamorphosis, {{the cornea}} becomes more dome-shaped, the lens becomes flatter, and eyelids and {{associated}} glands and ducts develop. The adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were {{a first step}} in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes. They allow colour vision and depth of focus. In the retinas are green rods, which are receptive to a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tellurium, {{which is}} a {{semiconductor}} in its standard state, is used mainly as a component in type II/VI semiconducting-chalcogenides; these have applications in electro-optics and electronics. Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is used in solar modules for its high conversion efficiency, low manufacturing costs, and large band gap of 1.44 eV, letting it absorb a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths.</b> Bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), alloyed with selenium and antimony, is a component of thermoelectric devices used for refrigeration or portable power generation.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{added two}} new {{instruments}} to Hubble. The first instrument, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, {{is now the}} most sensitive ultraviolet spectrograph installed on the telescope. Its far-UV channel is 30 times more sensitive than previous instruments and the near-UV is twice as sensitive. The second instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3, is a panchromatic wide-field camera that can record a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths,</b> including infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. Atlantis also carried the Soft-Capture Mechanism, which was installed onto the telescope.|$|E

50|$|Modern ellipsometers {{are complex}} {{instruments}} that incorporate {{a wide variety}} of radiation sources, detectors, digital electronics and software.

40|$|Transmission of {{electromagnetic}} waves through a Si-based one dimensional photonic crystal has been investigated. The proposed structure {{works as an}} omni-directional reflector for a certain <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelength</b> for an angle of incidence up to 55 ?. The structure works as a narrow band TM-polarization filter for an angle of incidence more than 55 ?, i. e. a filter which completely blocks TE-polarized waves but allows certain <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> TM-polarized waves. But at an angle of incidence of 89 ?, the structure works as a multiple narrow band TM-polarization filter even though no defect layer is introduced inside the structure. It is also found that this multiple narrow pass-bands of TM-polarized waves can be tuned to a desired <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelength</b> by changing {{the temperature of the}} structure...|$|R
25|$|The human {{visual system}} {{perceives}} visible {{light in the}} <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths</b> between 370 and 730 nanometers (0.00000037 to 0.00000073 meters) of the electromagnetic spectrum.|$|E
25|$|For {{scientific}} optical work, dielectric mirrors {{are often}} used. These are glass (or sometimes other material) substrates on which {{one or more}} layers of dielectric material are deposited, to form an optical coating. By careful choice of the type and thickness of the dielectric layers, the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths</b> and amount of light reflected from the mirror can be specified. The best mirrors of this type can reflect >99.999% of the light (in a narrow <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths)</b> which is incident on the mirror. Such mirrors are often used in lasers.|$|E
25|$|Active mirrors are mirrors that {{amplify the}} light they reflect. They {{are used to}} make disk lasers. The {{amplification}} is typically over a narrow <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths,</b> and requires an external source of power.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the colors}} listed do not reach the maximal (spectral) colorfulness, or are not usually seen with it, {{but they can be}} {{saturated}} enough to be perceived closely to their dominant <b>wavelength</b> spectral colors. <b>Ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths</b> and frequencies are only approximate.|$|R
50|$|MIT {{computer}} simulations by Fung along with lab experiments are designing a metamaterial with a multilayer sawtooth structure that slows and absorbs light {{over a wide}} <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelength</b> frequencies, and at a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> incident angles, at 95% efficiency. This has an extremely wide window for colors of light.|$|R
30|$|However, {{there are}} not {{sufficient}} systematic studies that have investigated the behaviors of light in this wavelength range.

25|$|Recent {{innovations}} in DWDM transport systems include pluggable and software-tunable transceiver modules capable of operating on 40 or 80 channels.

25|$|To enhance visualization, {{nanoparticles}} {{can also}} be made to fluoresce by controlling {{the size and shape}} of a nanoparticle probe. Fluorescence increases luminescence by increasing the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths</b> the emitted light can reach, allowing for biomarkers with a variety of colors. This technique is used to track the efficacy of protein transfer both in vivo and in vitro in terms of genetic alternations.|$|E
25|$|Constructive {{interference}} in thin films can create strong reflection {{of light in}} a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths,</b> which can be narrow or broad depending {{on the design of}} the coating. These films are used to make dielectric mirrors, interference filters, heat reflectors, and filters for colour separation in colour television cameras. This interference effect is also what causes the colourful rainbow patterns seen in oil slicks.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{research}} on medieval tin glaze {{has shown that}} the particle size of tin oxide which appears as cassiterite is around several hundred nanometer, which corresponds to the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> visible light. In some cases, the tin oxide is presented not only as small crystals but also as aggregates of particles. These factors - the high refractive index, the low solubility in glazes and the particle size make tin oxide an excellent opacifier.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Transparent heat mirror {{thin films}} have high {{transmittance}} in the visible <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelength</b> and high reflectance {{in the infrared}} <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelength.</b> TiO 2 /TiN/TiO 2 films prepared via a D. C reactive magnetron sputtering method on Corning glass and Alkali glass substrates, serve as transparent heat mirrors. The outer TiO 2 layer has both the photo-catalytic and anti-reflective properties. The experiment data showed that the film thickness required for photo-catalytic properties exceeds 350 nm. In this report, we found {{the relationship between the}} thicknesses of the films via calculation and experiment. Prepared films have both catalytic and transparent heat mirror properties with an inner TiO 2 layer thickness of 40 - 300 nm, a sandwich TiN layer thickness of 22 - 35 nm and an outer TiO 2 layer thickness exceeding 350 nm...|$|R
25|$|A {{mirror is}} {{an object that}} {{reflects}} light {{in such a way}} that, for incident light in some <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths,</b> the reflected light preserves many or most of the detailed physical characteristics of the original light, called specular reflection. This is different from other light-reflecting objects that do not preserve much of the original wave signal other than color and diffuse reflected light, such as flat-white paint.|$|E
25|$|Waves in {{crystalline}} solids are not continuous, {{because they}} are composed of vibrations of discrete particles arranged in a regular lattice. This produces aliasing because the same vibration can be considered to {{have a variety of}} different wavelengths, as shown in the figure. Descriptions using more than one of these wavelengths are redundant; it is conventional to choose the longest wavelength that fits the phenomenon. The <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths</b> sufficient to provide a description of all possible waves in a crystalline medium corresponds to the wave vectors confined to the Brillouin zone.|$|E
25|$|As an example, {{suppose that}} {{light in the}} orange <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{wavelengths}}</b> (approximately 577nm to 597nm) enters the eye and strikes the retina. Light of these wavelengths would activate both the medium and long wavelength cones of the retina, but not equally—the long-wavelength cells will respond more. The difference in the response can be detected by the brain, and this difference {{is the basis of}} our perception of orange. Thus, the orange appearance of an object results from light from the object entering our eye and stimulating the different cones simultaneously but to different degrees.|$|E
50|$|Fluorescent stamps can be {{detected}} with a black light fluorescent tube. Phosphorescent stamps can {{be detected}} using a shortwave UV lamp. The effects of both processes can be recorded photographically. Lamps for both <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths</b> as well as combinations of both are available. Care must be taken when using UV lamps, since their light can damage the eyes.|$|R

Experimental data are in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction...|$|R
25|$|Silica {{exhibits}} {{fairly good}} optical transmission {{over a wide}} <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths.</b> In the near-infrared (near IR) portion of the spectrum, particularly around 1.5 μm, silica can have extremely low absorption and scattering losses {{of the order of}} 0.2dB/km. Such remarkably low losses are possible only because ultra-pure silicon is available, it being essential for manufacturing integrated circuits and discrete transistors. A high transparency in the 1.4-μm region is achieved by maintaining a low concentration of hydroxyl groups (OH). Alternatively, a high OH concentration is better for transmission in the ultraviolet (UV) region.|$|E
25|$|Since {{only a few}} atoms must {{be excited}} into the upper laser level to form a {{population}} inversion, a four-level laser is much more efficient than a three-level one, and most practical lasers are of this type. In reality, many more than four energy levels {{may be involved in}} the laser process, with complex excitation and relaxation processes involved between these levels. In particular, the pump band may consist of several distinct energy levels, or a continuum of levels, which allow optical pumping of the medium over a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wavelength is {{a measure}} of the {{distance}} between repetitions of a shape feature such as peaks, valleys, or zero-crossings, not a measure of how far any given particle moves. For example, in sinusoidal waves over deep water a particle near the water's surface moves in a circle of the same diameter as the wave height, unrelated to wavelength. The <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths</b> or frequencies for wave phenomena is called a spectrum. The name originated with the visible light spectrum but now can be applied to the entire electromagnetic spectrum as well as to a sound spectrum or vibration spectrum.|$|E

One {{of the unique}} features of ASTROSAT mission is that it enables the simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of various astronomical objects with a single satellite.

25|$|In optical radiometry, {{sheets of}} PTFE {{are used as}} {{measuring}} heads in spectroradiometers and broadband radiometers (e.g., illuminance meters and UV radiometers) due to PTFE's capability to diffuse a transmitting light nearly perfectly. Moreover, optical properties of PTFE stay constant over a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths,</b> from UV down to near infrared. In this region, the relation of its regular transmittance to diffuse transmittance is negligibly small, so light transmitted through a diffuser (PTFE sheet) radiates like Lambert's cosine law. Thus PTFE enables cosinusoidal angular response for a detector measuring the power of optical radiation at a surface, e.g. in solar irradiance measurements.|$|E
25|$|They were {{originally}} used, and still are, {{to increase the}} sensitivity range of photographic emulsions, i.e., to increase the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths</b> which will form an image on the film, making the film panchromatic. Cyanines are also used in CD-R and DVD-R media. The ones used are mostly green or light blue in color, and are chemically unstable. This makes unstabilized cyanine discs unsuitable for archival CD and DVD use, as they can fade and become unreadable in a few years, however, recent cyanine discs contain stabilizers that slow down the deterioration significantly. These discs are often rated with an archival life of 75 years or more. The other dyes used in CD-Rs are phthalocyanine and azo.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{birefringence}} Δn {{may vary}} slightly due to dispersion, this is negligible {{compared to the}} variation in phase difference according to the wavelength of the light due to the fixed path difference (λ0 in the denominator in the above equation). Waveplates are thus manufactured {{to work for a}} particular <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>wavelengths.</b> The phase variation can be minimized by stacking two waveplates that differ by a tiny amount in thickness back-to-back, with the slow axis of one along the fast axis of the other. With this configuration, the relative phase imparted can be, for the case of a quarter-wave plate, one-fourth a wavelength rather than three-fourths or one-fourth plus an integer. This is called a zero-order waveplate.|$|E
