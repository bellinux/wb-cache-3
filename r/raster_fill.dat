50|$|To {{produce a}} desired shape, images are drawn with a <b>raster</b> <b>fill</b> {{of a single}} long DNA molecule. This design is then fed into a {{computer}} program that calculates the placement of individual staple strands. Each staple binds to a specific region of the DNA template, and thus due to Watson-Crick base pairing, the necessary sequences of all staple strands are known and displayed. The DNA is mixed, then heated and cooled. As the DNA cools, the various staples pull the long strand into the desired shape. Designs are directly observable via several methods, including electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, or fluorescence microscopy when DNA is coupled to fluorescent materials.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{generation}} of arbitrary patterns and shapes at very small scales {{is at the}} heart of our effort to miniaturize circuits and is fundamental to the development of nanotechnology. Here I review a recently developed method for folding long single strands of DNA into arbitrary two-dimensional shapes using a <b>raster</b> <b>fill</b> technique – ‘scaffolded DNA origami’. Shapes up to 100 nanometers in diameter can be approximated with a resolution of 6 nanometers and decorated with patterns of roughly 200 binary pixels at the same resolution. Experimentally verified by the creation of a dozen shapes and patterns, the method is easy, high yield, and lends itself well to automated design and manufacture. So far, CAD tools for scaffolded DNA origami are simple, require hand-design of the folding path, and are restricted to two dimensional designs. If the method gains wide acceptance, better CAD tools will be required. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} {{industries are}} contemplating {{to develop new}} technologies for production of complex end use parts possessing high strength and low product development cycle {{in order to meet}} the global competition. Rapid prototyping (RP) is one of the proficient processes having the ability to build complex geometry parts in reasonably less time and material waste. Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is one of the RP processes that can manufacture 3 D complex geometry accurately with good mechanical strength and durability. Normally, the FDM process is a parametric dependant process due to its layer-by-layer build mechanism. As FDM build parts are used as end use parts, it is prudent to study the effect of process parameters on the mechanical strength under both static and dynamic loading conditions and wear (sliding) behaviour. In order to investigate the behaviour of build parts in a systematic manner with less number of experimental runs, design of experiment (DOE) approach has been used to save cost and time of experimentation. As the selection of input process parameters influence on build mechanism, the mechanical properties and wear behaviour of FDM build parts change with process parameters. Notably, the <b>raster</b> <b>fill</b> pattern during part building causes FDM build parts to exhibit anisotropic behaviour when subject to loading (static or dynamic). In this research work, an attempt has been made to minimise the anisotropic behaviour through controlling the <b>raster</b> <b>fill</b> pattern during part building by adequate selection of process parameters. Statistical significance of the process parameters is analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Influence of process parameters on performance characteristics like mechanical strength, fatigue life and wear of build part is analysed with the help of surface plots. Internal structure of rasters, failure of rasters, formation of pits and crack are evaluated using scanning electron machine (SEM) micro-graphs. Empirical models have been proposed to relate the performance characteristics with process parameters. Optimal parameter setting has been suggested using a nature inspired metaheuristic firefly algorithm to improve the mechanical strength. Finally, genetic programming (GP) and least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) are adopted to develop predictive models for various performance characteristic...|$|E

Most well-known {{of the early}} pioneers with this was artist Peter Foldes, who completed Metadata in 1971. This film comprised drawings animated by gradually changing from one image to the next, a technique known as [...] "interpolating" [...] (also known as [...] "inbetweening" [...] or [...] "morphing"), which also featured {{in a number of}} earlier art examples during the 1960s. In 1974, Foldes completed Hunger / La Faim, {{which was one of the}} first films to show solid <b>filled</b> (<b>raster</b> scanned) rendering, and was awarded the Jury Prize in the short film category at 1974 Cannes Film Festival, as well as an Academy Award nomination.|$|R
40|$|We {{suggest a}} new {{technique}} for fabricating a wide class of continuous refractive optical elements in glass by combining the technique of ion exchange with high precision structuring of metal masks. We call this technique mask structured ion exchange (MSI). We have demonstrated the potential of this method by fabrication of rectangular shaped microlenses with low numerical aperture for Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensing applications. The lenses, positioned on a 400 µm <b>raster,</b> had a <b>fill</b> factor of 100 %, a focal length of 33 mm and diffraction limited performance. Due to the special fabrication conditions, the lens shape, position and even the focal length can be varied spatially within one substrate. For realization of a high aperture microlens array by field assisted exchange process we could reduce proximity effects between adjacent mask apertures by MSI...|$|R
40|$|Three Dimensional Printing (3 DP) {{is a solid}} {{freeform}} fabrication process used to generate solid parts directly from three-dimensional computer models. A part geometry is created by selectively depositing binder into sequentially spread layers of powder. In slurry-based 3 DP, a suspension of powder in a solvent is used to form the powderbed layer. This slurry-based powderbed yields higher green density and part resolution than dry powder-based 3 DP because of smaller particle size. Vector printing requires that the printhead trace and define the external geometries of a part before <b>raster</b> <b>filling</b> the interior, a new approach in comparison to conventional, raster-only printing. Drop-on-demand (DOD) printheads allow binder droplets to be ejected when needed rather than relying upon charge-and-deflect mechanisms used in continuous jet printheads. Integrating these concepts for vector, DOD printing {{has the potential to}} enhance the 3 DP process by providing greater part resolution and surface finish. The 3 DP slurry-based process and vector, drop-on-demand printing are examined as potential methods to produce Tungsten Carbide-Cobalt (WC-Co) tooling inserts. The research focuses on three fundamental process steps: (1) development of a stable slurry, (2) determination of jetting parameter values for optimal powderbed deposition, and (3) implementation of vector, DOD printing for the binder. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the first two objectives are only briefly introduced in Chapter 1 and summarized in Chapter 3. Further details may be found in the Diplomarbeit document of Olaf Dambon. Two approaches are explored to develop a stable, jettable slurry. One method involves using a water-based Tungsten Carbide slurry and a(cont.) Cobalt Acetate binder; the other method utilizes an alcohol-based Tungsten Carbide-Cobalt slurry and an organic binder. Various suspension properties, such as sedimentation density and viscosity, are measured to assess the degree of slurry stability. After adequate slurry formulations are developed, an investigation of powderbed formation is conducted. Due to the low solubility limit of the Cobalt salt in water and the persistent defects in water-based slurry powderbeds, the alcohol-based approach is pursued and, because of its greater efficacy, is used for optimizing powderbed jetting parameters. An effective combination of line spacing, flow rate, and drying time is determined for producing powderbeds with minimal surface roughness and high packing density. Experiments are subsequently conducted in vector DOD printing of various geometries using a piezo-actuated, drop-on-demand printhead and Bridgeport three-axis milling machine. A Hewlett-Packard inkjet cartridge is initially used for vector testing of the milling machine; a Siemens PT- 88 S printhead is used to assess and optimize binder droplet formation parameters, such as voltage waveform and fluid properties. Functional conditions for vector printing and DOD droplet generation are developed and deliver acceptable performance. Successfully printed geometries with high-definition lines (140 - 170 [mu]m line width) and smooth surface finish are produced using sanded, jetted alumina slurry powderbeds. Following necessary refinements in slurry redispersion and slurry-binder compatibility, the same vector process can be repeated with jetted WC-Co slurry powderbeds. by David Guo. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades, {{developments}} within the area of Additive Manufacturing (AM) have resulted in novel technologies capable of producing highly customized, complex part geometries in {{a fraction of the}} lead time required by traditional manufacturing methods (e. g., injection molding, metal casting). In particular, fused deposition modeling (FDM), a material extrusion AM process, can produce parts using production-grade thermoplastics like acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polycarbonate, and polyetherimide. Additionally, non-commercial materials (e. g., polycaprolactone, ceramic loaded polymers, carbon nanotube loaded polymers) have been processed using FDM in part to demonstrate the potential diversity in material selection. ^ Recently, a myriad of personal 3 D Printers using material extrusion processes have received much attention because they resemble the initial steps towards transforming AM technologies into a home consumer item. These steps were also taken during the 1980 s by inkjet printing technologies when they were first entering the home consumer market. However, before inkjet printers became a home consumer item, challenges related to the controlled flow of inks and the clogging of print heads needed to be resolved. Synonymously, FDM technologies need to resolve issues related to part accuracy, surface roughness, build time, and mechanical properties before they can be fully adopted by industry and home consumers. ^ A multi-material, multi-technology (MMMT) FDM system was developed to enable experimental methods related to the FDM attributes in need of improvement. The MMMT FDM system consists of two legacy FDM systems, a pneumatic slide, and an overall control system. The FDM systems were modified so that they mimic a gantry system enabling a work piece to be transported between each FDM system. A build platform was attached to the pneumatic slide to enable the transportation of the workpiece. A software program named FDMotion was developed to control each FDM system and the pneumatic slide via a graphic user interface as well as provide in-process instructions to the user. The functional MMMT FDM system was used to explore build process variations, the effect of ultraviolet ozone surface treatments at every layer on mechanical properties, {{and the development of a}} novel heat treatment for multi-material parts produced via FDM. Additionally, the system was employed to demonstrate the fabrication of multi-colored parts as well as multi-material parts made from discrete similar and dissimilar thermoplastics. ^ The build process variation consisted of depositing fine contours to promote dimensional accuracy and reduce surface roughness while depositing larger internal <b>fill</b> <b>rasters</b> to decrease build time. The internal roads were four times thicker and five times wider than the outer roads. A 55...|$|R
