5|$|The {{return of}} Australian {{personnel}} from the SWPA was delayed by shipping shortages {{and the need}} to maintain a force in the area for garrison duties. The military provided these personnel with training courses to prepare them for civilian life. <b>Refresher</b> <b>courses</b> in basic subjects such as maths and English were run first before vocational training began. The teachers and instructors for these courses were service personnel {{selected on the basis of}} their civilian occupations. In addition, sport competitions were conducted to keep the men busy.|$|E
5|$|No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit (No.2 OCU) is {{a fighter}} {{training}} {{unit of the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Located at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, the unit trains pilots to operate the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, conducts <b>refresher</b> <b>courses</b> for pilots returning to the type, and trains future Hornet instructors. Pilots new to the Hornet enter No.2OCU after first qualifying to fly fast jets at No.79 Squadron and undertaking initial fighter combat instruction at No.76 Squadron. Once qualified on the F/A-18, they are posted to one of No.81 Wing's operational Hornet units, No.3 Squadron, No.75 Squadron or No.77 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} fiscal years 1941 and 1942, {{the federal government}} partially funded the education of 12,000 students at 309 nursing schools. Through that initiative, 3,800 inactive nurses received <b>refresher</b> <b>courses</b> and 4,800 graduated nurses received postgraduate training. By the end of 1942, 47,500 students were enrolled in nursing schools {{but that did not}} meet the country's need. At this point, it was clear that nurses could not be trained quickly enough to keep abreast of both civilian and military needs. The need for additional federal aid for the recruitment of nurses became apparent when the U.S. Army and Navy called for 2,500 new nurses each month during the fiscal year 1943.|$|E

5|$|The RAAF {{moved to}} rectify the {{situation}} by re-forming No.2OTU on 1March 1952 to convert RAAF pilots to jet aircraft and train them for fighter operations. Headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, it was equipped with Wirraways, Mustangs, and deHavilland Vampire jets. Cresswell took command of No.2 OTU on 21May 1953. The unit ceased flying Mustangs that October, retaining its Wirraways and Vampires. In April 1954, it began conducting fighter combat instructor courses, as well as <b>refresher</b> <b>courses</b> on jets. Cresswell delivered the first Australian-built CAC Sabre jet fighter to No.2 OTU in November, and the same month established the unit's Sabre Trials Flight. The flight was responsible for performance testing and developing combat flying techniques, {{in concert with the}} Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU). On 3December 1954, Creswell led a formation of twelve No.2 OTU Vampires in the shape of two sevens over Sydney to greet No.77 Squadron upon its arrival from service in Korea aboard the aircraft carrier HMAS Vengeance. Training courses on the Sabre began on 1January 1955. Once the Sabre entered operational service in March 1956, the Sabre Trials Flight was dissolved and its responsibilities passed to No.3 Squadron. Pilots underwent their introduction to jets and fighter combat at No.2 OTU, but finished their conversion to Sabres at a front-line squadron.|$|E
