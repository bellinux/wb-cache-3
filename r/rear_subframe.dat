2500|$|After the {{inclusion}} of the speed limiting system in 2000, the Hayabusa remained substantially the same through the 2007 model year. An exception was a response to the problem of the aluminum <b>rear</b> <b>subframe</b> on 1999 and 2000 models breaking when the bike may have been overloaded with a passenger and luggage, and/or stressed by an aftermarket exhaust modification, so 2001 and later Hayabusas had a steel instead of aluminum <b>rear</b> <b>subframe,</b> adding [...] to the 1999 and 2000 models' approximately [...] wet weight.|$|E
2500|$|Chrysler {{made many}} {{attempts}} at improving the aerodynamics of the 500 by adding noses {{rumored to be}} up to [...] long. The Charger Daytona finally received an [...] nose. The full size Charger Daytona was tested with an [...] nose at the Lockheed-Martin Georgia facility. The test was a success and the project was greenlighted. The nose piece was only part of the innovation. The Charger Daytona also received a [...] tall wing in rear. This wing was bolted through the rear quarter panels and into the <b>rear</b> <b>subframe.</b> Although proven to be less effective than shorter wing designs, the engineer responsible {{for the development of the}} wing, John Pointer, chose the tall design so the wing would be in [...] "clean air" [...] to help increase the car's overall speed. That the tall wing prevents interference with operation of the trunk lid can be considered a fortunate coincidence. The tall wing also helped out in another unintended way, by giving the car directional stability due to its deeply splinted sides.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to previous years <b>rear</b> <b>subframe</b> issues along with changing competition trends, 2005 was first year to utilize an aluminum plate <b>rear</b> <b>subframe</b> created via water jet. This design provided quick and accurate creation of subframe and also maintained precise suspension points.|$|E

50|$|The car {{features}} an aluminium 'spine' {{to which a}} composite passenger ‘tub’ and front and <b>rear</b> <b>subframes</b> are attached. The ‘spine’ {{is believed to be}} the largest single aluminium extrusion used in any road car, with a torsional stiffness in excess of 10,000 Nm/degree.|$|R

50|$|The revolutionary {{monocoque}} transverse engined {{front wheel}} drive 1959 Austin Mini, that set the template for modern {{front wheel drive}} cars, used front and <b>rear</b> <b>subframes</b> to provide accurate road wheel control while using a stiff lightweight body. The 1961 Jaguar E-type or XKE used a tubular spaceframe type front subframe to mount the engine gearbox and long bonnet / hood, to a monocoque 'tub' passenger compartment.|$|R
50|$|The {{body is a}} conventional, but light, unibody or {{monocoque}} construction, with (detachable) {{front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>subframes.</b> The MX-5 also incorporates a longitudinal truss, marketed as the Powerplant Frame (PPF), providing a rigid connection between the engine and differential, minimizing flex and contributing to responsive handling. Some MX-5s feature limited slip differentials and anti-lock braking system. Traction control is an option available on NC models. All models weighed approximately one tonne.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, in Auckland, New Zealand, a few cars called the 'Ibis Berkeley' were made that paid {{homage to the}} Berkeley—but using Mini front and <b>rear</b> <b>subframes</b> and a {{fibreglass}} monocoque 6 inches wider. Sold as complete body units to accept Mini parts by Ian Byrd and Tim Monck-Mason, these were advanced little cars using carbon fibres and foam beams. This later became the WASP looking more like a scaled down Cobra.|$|R
25|$|Because the Moke's A-Series engine, {{manual gearbox}} and {{suspension}} are {{identical to those}} of a standard Mini (which was still in production up to October 2000), most spare parts are still readily available. The Moke has no chassis, so the wheels, brake assemblies and suspension are attached to front and <b>rear</b> <b>subframes</b> bolted straight onto the monocoque shell, just as with a standard Mini. Mokes tend to require much structural maintenance {{if they are to}} stay in good running order.|$|R
2500|$|The central carbon chassis {{incorporates}} a roll cage and a rubber racing fuel cell with 4 fuel pumps and quick refuel filler cap, similar to GT race cars. The wheelbase has been increased by [...] to increase stability. The front and <b>rear</b> <b>subframes</b> are brand-new, built to accommodate new suspension geometry, and produced in Avional. The slick-shod wheels are new forged-magnesium center-lock models, which {{in conjunction with}} on-board pneumatic airjacks (again, like the FXX) allow rapid change of the entire wheel assemblies.|$|R

50|$|The 2001 car {{featured}} upgrades {{and lessons}} learned from the 2000 car which include improved bellcrank mounting and lighter front uprights. New rear suspension geometry (new <b>rear</b> <b>subframe)</b> was also introduced this year.|$|E
5000|$|The frame {{used on the}} ZX-7R is a {{lightweight}} aluminum twin-spar item, designed using computer-aided design to optimize strength. The <b>rear</b> <b>subframe</b> was constructed using steel, providing enough strength for a pillion passenger.|$|E

50|$|The 6-speed torque {{converter}} automatic transmission was a 6HP26 supplied by ZF Friedrichshafen. Unlike the DuoSelect it {{was placed in}} the conventional position right behind the engine; to accommodate it and the new rear differential the front and <b>rear</b> <b>subframes</b> as well as part of the transmission tunnel had to be redesigned.Manual shifting was possible by the centre-console mounted gear lever; in addition Sport GT cars came equipped with paddle shifters as standard, while on other models they were an optional extra.|$|R
50|$|Ducati updated {{the bike}} with Öhlins front forks, which {{featured}} a titanium nitride coating on the stanchions to minimise stiction. An aluminum <b>rear</b> <b>subframe</b> and other detail modifications reduced the bike's weight even further.|$|E
50|$|The car {{was based}} on two front Rover Metro subframes, with the {{steering}} being locked on the <b>rear</b> <b>subframe,</b> these were fitted to a fibreglass monocoque tub. Coupé or convertible bodywork could be specified.|$|E
50|$|The BMW R nineT {{has several}} design {{elements}} configured {{to allow the}} bike to be easily modified, such as separate engine and chassis wiring harnesses and minimal bolts attaching the <b>rear</b> <b>subframe,</b> tail lights, and headlight.|$|E
5000|$|The Quattroporte {{body is a}} steel unibody, with {{aluminium}} {{boot lid}} and engine bonnet; [...] is 0.35. Front and <b>rear</b> aluminium <b>subframes</b> support the whole suspension and drivetrain.|$|R
50|$|The Bendix SWC was {{intended}} to be a unit-body but limited time and finances dictated a conventional and heavier steel box frame central member with front and <b>rear</b> <b>subframes.</b> The body construction was orthodox with steel panels mounted over a wooden frame, but curb weight climbed to more than 3,000 pounds, twice the 1,500 to 1,700-pound target weight. To counter the weight gain, aluminum was used for the hood, fenders, doors and rear wheel skirts. Due to an impending deadline, Ortwig utilized a DeSoto Airflow grille and headlamp doors to finish the car.|$|R
5000|$|The 2005 RL car {{structure}} made {{extensive use}} of somewhat [...] "exotic" [...] materials for a car at this price point. These included aluminum alloy in the hood, front fenders, trunk lid and frame, front and <b>rear</b> <b>subframes,</b> suspension arms, front knuckles and bumper beams. Magnesium {{was used in the}} intake manifold, and the two-piece center drive shaft was made of a carbon reinforced composite. The new RL featured extensive aerodynamic design treatment including details such as industry-first flush side glass, plus underbody covers and diffusers to reduce lift, resulting in a very low drag coefficient of 0.29.|$|R
