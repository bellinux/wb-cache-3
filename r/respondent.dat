5|$|The census {{enumeration}} {{was carried}} out from 16 October to 15 November 2010 by 25,000 school leavers and 8,400 census supervisors deputed by the Census Statistical Office of Zambia. Civil servants from various government departments trained the enumerators. There were two forms: Form A, which had basic details like full name, sex, membership status, expected to be answered by senior members of each household; Form B which had details about individual members of the family. When the <b>respondent</b> was a minor, proxy members having knowledge about the family were questioned. The details in form B were not sufficiently captured in the forms answered by the proxy members, most of whom did not have full information about all the family members. All buildings that were complete, incomplete, abandoned, habitable or inhabitable were accounted by the enumerators. Compared to the form used during 2000 census enumeration, there were additional details on death of household members, maternal deaths, albimism, orphanhood and fosterhood in the forms used in 2010. The enumeration was completed by 15 November 2010 for majority of the regions, while all the remaining {{regions of the country}} were completed by 30 November 2010. A total of 3.2 million questionnaires were used for data collection and the Central Statistical Office started processing the forms from April 2011.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Non-response is a {{major concern}} among {{substance}} use epidemiologists. When differences exist between <b>respondents</b> and non-respondents, survey estimates may be biased. Therefore, researchers have developed time-consuming strategies to convert non-respondents to <b>respondents.</b> The present study examines whether late <b>respondents</b> (converted former non-participants) differ from early <b>respondents,</b> non-consenters or silent refusers (consent givers but non-participants) in a cohort study, and whether non-response bias can be reduced by converting former non-respondents. METHODS: 6099 French- and 5720 German-speaking Swiss 20 -year-old males (more than 94 % of the source population) completed a short questionnaire on substance use outcomes and socio-demographics, independent of any further participation in a cohort study. Early <b>respondents</b> were those participating in the cohort study after standard recruitment procedures. Late <b>respondents</b> were non-respondents that were converted through individual encouraging telephone contact. Early <b>respondents,</b> non-consenters and silent refusers were compared to late <b>respondents</b> using logistic regressions. Relative non-response biases for early <b>respondents</b> only, for <b>respondents</b> only (early and late) and for consenters (<b>respondents</b> and silent refusers) were also computed. RESULTS: Late <b>respondents</b> showed generally higher patterns of substance use than did early <b>respondents,</b> but lower patterns than did non-consenters and silent refusers. Converting initial non-respondents to <b>respondents</b> reduced the non-response bias, which might be further reduced if silent refusers were converted to <b>respondents.</b> CONCLUSION: Efforts to convert refusers are effective in reducing non-response bias. However, converted late <b>respondents</b> cannot be seen as proxies of non-respondents, and are at best only indicative of existing response bias due to persistent non-respondents...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionBecause {{many aspects}} of the {{management}} of esophageal atresia (EA) are still controversial, we evaluated the practice patterns of this condition across Europe. MethodsA survey was completed by 178 delegates (from 45 [27 European] countries; 88 % senior <b>respondents)</b> at the EUPSA-BAPS 2012. ResultsApproximately 66 % of <b>respondents</b> work in centers where more than five EA repairs are performed per year. Preoperatively, 81 % of <b>respondents</b> request an echocardiogram, and only 43 % of <b>respondents</b> routinely perform preoperative bronchoscopy. Approximately 94 % of <b>respondents</b> prefer an open approach, which is extrapleural in 71 % of <b>respondents.</b> There were no differences in use of thoracoscopy between Europeans (10 %) and non-Europeans (11 %, p=nonsignificant). Approximately 60 % of <b>respondents</b> measure the gap intraoperatively. A transanastomotic tube (90 %) and chest drain (69 %) are left in situ. Elective paralysis is adopted by 56 % of <b>respondents</b> mainly for anastomosis tension (65 %). About 72 % of <b>respondents</b> routinely request a contrast study on postoperative day 7 (2 - 14). Approximately 54 % of <b>respondents</b> use parenteral nutrition, 40 % of <b>respondents</b> start transanastomotic feeds on postoperative day 1, and 89 % of <b>respondents</b> start oral feeds after postoperative day 5. Pure EA: 46 % of <b>respondents</b> work in centers that repair two or more than two pure EA a year. About 60 % of <b>respondents</b> opt for delayed primary anastomosis at 3 months (1 - 12 months) with gastrostomy formation without esophagostomy. Anastomosis is achieved with open approach by 85 % of <b>respondents.</b> About 47 % of <b>respondents</b> attempt elongation of esophageal ends via Foker technique (43 %) or with serial dilations with bougies (41 %). Approximately 67 % of <b>respondents</b> always attempt an anastomosis. Gastric interposition is the commonest esophageal substitution. ConclusionMany aspects of EA management are lacking consensus.
