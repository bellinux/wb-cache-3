5000|$|Surugatoxin is a specific, reversible, {{competitive}} antagonist of ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACHRs). [...] Although {{a number}} of articles {{were published in the}} two decades following the discovery of SGTX in the mid-1960s, relatively {{little is known about the}} pharmacological properties of this toxin. Ascher and colleagues posit that ganglionic blockade by SGTX results from binding to the closed state of the channel-receptor complex, possibly to the receptor itself. It is 50-100 times more potent than hexamethonium, another ganglionic antagonist of nAChRs. [...] Brown and colleagues found that the SGTX dissociation constants measured at equilibrium block in rats were 58nM and 76nM, as measured from the shift in depolarization produced by 0.2μM and 2 μM SGTX, respectively. [...] Surugatoxin is listed on two U.S. patents, both for potential clinical treatments. U.S. Patent 7,468,188 proposes the use of locally-administered neurotoxins in the treatment of muscle injury and U.S. Patent 7,214,700 proposes the use of (2-Oxindol-3-ylidenyl) acetic acid derivatives as protein kinase inhibitors.

40|$|It is {{now more}} than ten years ago that the Water Framework Directive (WFD) was adopted by the European Parliament. The main {{objectives}} of the WFD are (i) to achieve good ecological and chemical status for inland surface waters, transitional waters and coastal waters in EU Member States, (ii) to assess the ecological and chemical status of these water bodies by means of monitoring programmes, and (iii) to implement programmes of measures to reduce environmental stress to an acceptable level. By adopting the WFD a fundamental change in management objective was introduced in the European Union, from merely pollution control to ensuring ecosystem integrity as a whole [1]. The ecological status of WFD water bodies is assessed by monitoring of biological quality elements (e. g. fish, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, benthic diatoms, phytoplankton), general chemical and physico-chemical quality elements (e. g. pH, alkalinity, nutrients) and hydromorphological quality elements. These quality elements monitored in water bodies are compared with the status of more or less pristine reference ecosystems. If in WFD water bodies the ecological status deviates too much from the reference condition action is needed for achieving the acceptable ecological status. The chemical status of water bodies is assessed by comparing chemical monitoring data with Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) for priority (hazardous) <b>substances</b> and other <b>relevant</b> <b>substances.</b> Currently, 41 priority (hazardous) substances are listed in the European Union, but a regular update of this list with emerging substances is anticipated. If in water bodies exposure concentrations of {{one or more of these}} priority (hazardous) substances are not in compliance with the officially published EQS’s for these pollutants a good chemical status is not reached and action is needed to improve this. In contrast to the EU-level priority (hazardous) <b>substances</b> the other <b>relevant</b> <b>substances</b> are river basin or Member State specific. These other <b>relevant</b> <b>substances</b> have been selected because they are believed to potentially impair the ecological status of specific WFD water bodies and/or related human health aspects. The methodology to derive the EQS’s for other <b>relevant</b> <b>substances</b> is similar to that of the priority (hazardous) substances. This methodology is described in the new Technical Guidance Document for deriving Environmental Quality Standards (will be officially released in 2011). In European river basins the priority (hazardous) substances and river specific pollutants have to be measured on a regular basis. Under the umbrella of the WFD, EQS derivation is primarily based on a single substance toxicity assessment approach. In exceptional cases EQS’s for mixtures may be derived when their qualitative and quantitative composition is well-defined and/or well described (e. g. biocide preparations, PCB’s, dioxins). The concentration addition (CA) concept is used as a default when setting EQS’s for mixtures. Although compliance with good chemical status is primarily based on EQS’s for individual substances, cumulative stress (including mixtures) of toxicants may be identified as a main pressure affecting ecological status. In that case the cumulative risks caused by pollutants have to be reduced...|$|R

40|$|A {{reliable}} assessment of <b>relevant</b> <b>substance</b> flows {{is very important}} for environmental risk assessments and efficiency analysis of measures to reduce or avoid emissions of micropollutants like drugs to water systems. Accordingly, a detailed preparation of monitoring campaigns should include an accuracy check for the sampling configuration to prove the reliability of the monitoring results and the subsequent data processing. The accuracy of substance flow analyses is expected to be particularly weak for substances having high short-term variations of concentrations in sewage. This is especially the case linked to the observation of substance flows close to source in waste water systems. The verification of a monitoring configuration in a hospital sewer in Luxembourg is in the centre of interest of the case study presented here. A tracer test in the sewer system under observation is an essential element of the suggested accuracy check and provides valuable information for an uncertainty analysis. The results illustrate the importance of accuracy checks as an essential element of the preparation of monitoring campaigns.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{preparation}} of typically thermodynamically unstable polymorphic structures is a challenge. However, solid surfaces are well established aids {{for the formation}} and stabilization of polymorphic structures within, for instance, organic electronics.

Form III of paracetamol, which is typically unstable in the bulk at standard conditions, can be stabilized with a model silica surface by a standard spin coating procedure followed by rapid heat treatment.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the {{relationship of}} temperament with a number of <b>relevant</b> <b>substance</b> abuse characteristics in a substance abusing population. One hundred forty-five male veterans were interviewed on their lifetime use of substances and on their psychiatric symptoms, problems associated with use, context, and family history of substance abuse.

There was partial support for the hypotheses. Impulsivity was negatively correlated with age of onset and positively correlated with substance-related problems and a family history of substance abuse. Subjects with a history of depression scored significantly lower on the Positive Affectivity/Sociability factor than those who had not experienced a significant depression.
