While Plateau's laws, the rules governing the shape of soap films in foams were developed in the 19th century, a mathematical {{description of}} the structure is still debated.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of blown films {{is a complex}} industrial process that has received some attention in the past from both industry and academia with the intention to establish detailed property-structure-processing linkages between polymers and their resulting blown films. Unfortunately, {{a clear understanding of}} the molecular level architectural variables, which control important properties of blown films such as <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> and the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> puncture, are not fully developed. The current work uses powerful synchrotron based in situ X-ray scattering techniques to explore the morphologies of blown films as well as morphological evolution under uniaxial strain, for a series of polyethylenes whose architectures are well understood. Firstly, a number of protocols based on traditional analyses of X-ray scattering are developed which aid in the quantification of both the crystalline and non crystalline phases of the overall semicrystalline morphology of films. The analysis protocols developed allow the parametrization of dimensionality and orientation for both these phases at atomistic and mesoscopic length scales. Secondly, empirical relationships are established between the pertinent extracted parameters and molecular architectures of the polyethylenes under investigation. This enables the elucidation of those aspects of the molecular architecture of polyethylene the targeted manipulation of which is likely to result in the attainment of desired tear and puncture properties in blown films. Thirdly, quantitative relationships relating the dimensional and orientational parameters <b>to</b> the <b>tear</b> and puncture resistance properties are developed to determine the origin of these properties. Complementing the central theme of this dissertation are studies on the modeling of semicrystalline microstructures and the theoretical simulations of X-ray scattering from the same.

40|$|AIM The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the role of a connective tissue graft (CTG) or a collagen matrix (CM) interpositioned between flaps and non-shedding hard surfaces on wound stability. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty bone dehiscence defects were prepared in five Beagle dogs. Three treatments were performed in 12 sites per dog: (1) repositioned flaps were sutured onto instrumented dentin surfaces (control), (2) repositioning of flaps with an interpositioned CTG and (3) repositioning of flaps with the application of a CM. To allow postoperative healing with n = 5 for 1, 3, 7 and 14 days before evaluation, the sutures were removed, incision lines retraced and tensile forces applied to the flaps. The minimum magnitude of forces required to detach the flaps from the wound bed was recorded. RESULTS After 1 week of healing, 6 N had to be applied to disrupt flaps from their wound bed in the CTG group. In the control group, a similar magnitude of resistance was achieved after 2 weeks (6. 1 N). Flap <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>tearing</b> was highest in the CTG group (maximum 9. 1 N) 2 weeks postoperatively. On the third postoperative day, the mean tearing forces of all groups differed significantly, displaying a 50 % lower <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>tearing</b> in the CM compared to the CTG group.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this PhD thesis is the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> of {{reinforced}} elastomers. The general context of this work {{is related to the}} performances of reinforced elastomers, specifically silica reinforced natural rubber, as regards various usage properties : wear of tyre tread, fatigue and tear resistance of tyre flanks, etc. Wear and fatigue mechanisms are very complex. This PhD thesis is a first step towards understanding these mechanisms. We focussed on the parameters which control ultimate properties (<b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> failure, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> propagation) of uniaxially stretched samples. Reinforced elastomers are nanocomposite materials made of an elastomer matrix in which submicrometric filler particles or aggregates are dispersed. Adding fillers considerably enhances usage properties, specifically ultimate properties. Mechanical and physical properties qualitatively {{different from those of the}} pure elastomer matrix are induced: a strongly temperature dependent complex modulus, strong non linear effects (Payne effect), large dissipation, hysteresis, plasticity and long time recovery (Mullins effect). The material parameters which have an influence on the properties are: the nature of the elastomer matrix (natural or synthetic rubber) and of the reinforcing fillers (carbon black or silica), the volume fraction and dispersion state of the fillers, the nature and strength of interactions at filler-matrix interfaces. This work is an experimental study of the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> failure and <b>to</b> <b>tearing</b> of uniaxially stretched samples. The various systems which have been studied are presented first. Their mechanical properties have been characterized in the various regimes of strain amplitude. The various samples have been compared systematically in order to clarify the effect of the various material parameters. Natural rubber crystallizes under strain. This phenomenon is very sensitive to the formulation of the various materials and has a tremendous effect on mechanical and ultimate properties. Thus, we have measured quantitatively the amount of crystallinity induced as a function of the applied strain during elongation cycles and up to sample failure. The influence of the nature and volume fraction of the fillers and of the matrix-filler interfaces has been studied. The crystallinity is close to 13 % in all studied materials. In samples filled with silica, the nature of the filler-matrix interactions (covalent coupling vs no coupling) has very little influence on crystallization, whereas it modifies strongly the mechanical properties. Then we have studied the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> failure of uniaxially stretched pre-notched test samples. Within a macroscopic approach, we have related the ultimate property (energy density at break) <b>to</b> the various <b>tear</b> propagation modes which are observed. We have studied the effect of temperature and drawing speed. It has been shown that the higher <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> failure of reinforced natural rubber is related to the appearance of spectacular instabilities of the propagation direction (the so-called ‘tear rotation’). The appearance of tear rotation is specific to pre-notched reinforced natural rubber samples. The physical mechanisms responsible for tear rotation are not yet fully understood. The combination of reinforcement due to fillers and of strain-induced crystallization may lead to a strong anisotropy of the elastic material constant of the material in front of the tear tip, and this might be the driving force for tear rotation. The rotation length has been identified as an important parameter which correlates well to the ultimate properties. The tear propagation is described at various scales. The typical length scales associated <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> rotation which are observed have been related to the material properties. L'ajout de charges (agrégat de taille submicronique) dans une matrice élastomère apporte des propriétés physiques qualitativement différentes de celles de la matrice pure : module complexe dépendant de la température, forts effets non linéaires, forte dissipation [...] . Ces propriétés sont liées à la nature de la matrice et des charges, à leur fraction volumique, et enfin à la force des interactions charge / matrice. Nous présentons d'abord les différents systèmes et la caractérisation de leurs propriétés mécaniques, de façon à clarifier le rôle des différents paramètres. La cristallisation sous traction du caoutchouc naturel a un effet important sur ses propriétés mécaniques. Nous l'avons donc mesurée quantitativement dans chacune des formulations. Nous montrons que le taux de cristallisation à la rupture est toujours de l'ordre de 13 %. La nature de l'interface silice / matrice a un effet sur les propriétés mécaniques mais pas sur la cristallisation.

ENR 50 is a modified natural rubber having properties resembling those of synthetic rubbers rather than natural rubber. ENR 50 is miscible with polar rubber such as acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR).
