What the analysts who are gushing over Obama's sentiments regarding race relations are missing is not only did Obama fail to accomplish the mission he needed to, he didn't even <b>really</b> <b>try.</b> He made no attempt to explain his relationship with Wright and why he hung around a man who habitually offered such hateful rhetoric. Obama instead offered a non-sequitur on race relations.|$|E

According to producer Joshua Safran, {{the creators}} planned to revisit their relationship once {{the timing was}} right.

Azaria noted in an interview with The A.V. Club that The Smurfs and Night at the Museum were films he agreed to do primarily for the money, but that [...] "I won't even do that unless I think it will at least be fun to do...I <b>really</b> <b>try</b> to throw myself into it, figure out the funniest, cleverest way to get the material over, and make it fun to do and fun to watch."

500|$|... "Now {{the little}} Quest can <b>really</b> <b>try</b> her mettle", wrote Wild, {{as the ship}} entered the loose pack. He noted that Quest was the {{smallest}} ship ever to attempt to penetrate the heavy Antarctic ice, and pondered {{on the fate of}} others. [...] "Shall we escape, or will the Quest join the ships in Davy Jones's Locker?" [...] During the days that followed, as they moved southward in falling temperatures, the ice thickened. On 12 February they reached the most southerly latitude they would attain, 69°17'S, and their most easterly longitude, 17°9'E, well short of Enderby Land. Noting the state of the sea ice and fearing being frozen in, Wild retreated to the north and west. He still hoped to tackle the heavy ice, and if possible, break through to the hidden land beyond. On 18 February he turned the ship south again for another try, but was no more successful than before. On 24 February, after a series of further efforts had failed, Wild set a course westward across the mouth of the Weddell Sea towards Elephant Island, where Wild and 21 others had been stranded during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier. They would then return to South Georgia before the onset of winter.|$|E

500|$|Due to its {{tone and}} subject matter, it is {{considered}} one of the band's darker songs, alongside [...] "Adam's Song", their 2000 single revolving around suicide. Hoppus told an interviewer at the time of the album's release that [...] "There's always a song or two where we <b>really</b> <b>try</b> to really push ourselves [...] On this new record I think we've done a lot of different stuff that people wouldn't ever expect from us. [...] On the new one, it's 'Stay Together for the Kids.'" [...] DeLonge later confirmed he had received emails from fans thanking him for the song's message. [...] "With [...] "Stay Together", we get emails—just kid after kid after kid—saying, 'I know exactly what you're talking about! That song is about my life!'" [...] In 2002, divorce statistics were four times higher than their average just over thirty years prior, with over 50 percent of marriages ending in divorce. [...] "You look at statistics that 50 percent of parents get divorced, and you’re going to get a pretty large group of kids who are pissed off and who don’t agree with what their parents have done," [...] said DeLonge.

500|$|The 30 March 1967 photo {{session with}} Cooper also {{produced}} {{the back cover}} and the inside gatefold, which the musicologist Ian Inglis describes as conveying [...] "an obvious and immediate warmth... which distances it from the sterility and artifice typical of such images". McCartney explained: [...] "One {{of the things we}} were very much into in those days was eye messages... So with Michael Cooper's inside photo, we all said, 'Now look into this camera and really say I love you! <b>Really</b> <b>try</b> and feel love; really give love through this! It'll come out; it'll show; it's an attitude.' And that's what that is, {{if you look at it}} you'll see the big effort from the eyes." [...] The album's inner sleeve featured artwork by the Dutch design team the Fool that eschewed for the first time the standard white paper in favour of an abstract pattern of waves of maroon, red, pink and white. Included with the album as a bonus gift was a sheet of cardboard cut-outs designed by Blake and Haworth, a postcard-sized portrait of Sgt. Pepper based on a statue from Lennon's house that was used on the front cover, a fake moustache, two sets of sergeant stripes, two lapel badges and a stand-up cut-out of the Beatles in their satin uniforms. Moore believes that the inclusion of these items helped fans [...] "pretend to be in the band". However, many others have speculated that there may be a deeper meaning.|$|E

2500|$|Bianca's rape {{was heavily}} debated; viewers who despised the storyline argued the rape as [...] "punishment" [...] for her sexuality, and as unnecessary; others {{felt that it}} realistically {{captured}} what gay women sometimes face from men who want to force themselves on lesbians. When GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) was asked by Metro Weekly why GLAAD sent out an action alert voicing their concern over the rape of Bianca, but two days later sent out another release which seemed to support how the storyline was told, Joan M. Garry, {{executive director of the}} organization, responded that they had [...] "some concerns" [...] about [...] and [...] "that the broader context of the [...] genre kind of needs to be taken into account." [...] Metro Weekly felt that this did not answer their question. They wanted to know why there was a sudden reversal in GLAAD's statement, specifically citing that GLAAD's second press release spoke of rape experience for lesbians and how men who rape lesbians not only engage in gender based acts of violence, but in acts of hate violence, and that this release was supportive of how Bianca's rape storyline was told, as opposed to GLAAD's first press release on the matter. Garry said she felt that their first press release concerning Bianca's rape was premature. Metro Weekly countered by asking what is the [...] "actual process" [...] GLAAD uses to select what to criticize, what raises their organization's red flags. [...] "There's a whole host of input we receive about things as we hear about them, as we see them in script form, as we see them in pilots," [...] Garry relayed. [...] "We have a strong team of program folks who represent different regions around the country, different communities. We get an awful lot of stuff that comes across the transom via our website raising concerns. And we did get quite a number of concerns coming over email, particularly about All My Children." [...] Garry continued, [...] "So it's basically community feedback, {{as well as some of}} our own observations and perceptions. Combine that with conversations that we have with folks that are actually producing the images and we <b>really</b> <b>try</b> to work our way through those different opinions and shape a position we think makes sense." ...|$|E
