Every continent, every country, and every island on the globe, offers similar problems of greater or less complexity and interest, and the time has now arrived when their solution can be attempted with some prospect of success. Many {7} years study of this class of subjects has convinced me that there is no short and easy method of dealing with them; because they are, in their very nature, the visible outcome and <b>residual</b> <b>product</b> of the whole past history of the earth. If we take the organic productions of a small island, or of any very limited tract of country, such as a moderate-sized country parish, we have, in their relations and affinities--in {{the fact that they are}} there and others are not there, a problem which involves all the migrations of these species and their ancestral forms--all the vicissitudes of climate and all the changes of sea and land which have affected those migrations--the whole series of actions and reactions which have determined the preservation of some forms and the extinction of others,--in fact the whole history of the earth, inorganic and organic, throughout a large portion of geological time.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{seroprevalence}} {{of hepatitis}} E virus (HEV) among high-risk groups overseas is high, but studies in {{these groups are}} rare in South Korea. We conducted the present study from April to November 2012 to obtain data on the seroprevalence and associated risk factors for HEV among slaughterhouse workers in South Korea. Methods: Slaughterhouse workers from 80 workplaces nationwide were surveyed in South Korea in 2012. The subjects comprised 1848 cases: 1434 slaughter workers and 414 <b>residual</b> <b>products</b> handlers. By visiting 80 slaughterhouses, which were mixed with 75 of which also performed <b>residual</b> <b>products</b> handling, we conducted a questionnaire survey for risk factors and obtained blood samples {{in order to determine}} the seropositivity and seroprevalence of HEV. Anti-HEV IgG and IgM were measured using HEV IgG and IgM en-zyme-linked immunospecific assay kits and HEV antigen was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: The seropositivity of anti-HEV IgG was 33. 5 % (slaughter workers 32. 8 % and <b>residual</b> <b>products</b> handlers 36. 2 %), and among the seropositive individuals the seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgM was 0. 5 % (slaughter workers 0. 5 %, <b>residual</b> <b>products</b> handlers 0. 7 %). The response rate of HEV-antigen as measured by RT-PCR was 0. 2 %. Risk factors significantly related to anti-HEV IgG seropositivity were age, sex, and working duration (slaughter workers only). Conclusions: There were significant risk factors (sex, age, and working duration) for HEV identified in our study. All three positive cas-es for HEV-antigen by RT-PCR were related to pig slaughter but without statistical significance. To prevent HEV, an educational pro...|$|R

5000|$|Laterite is a <b>residual</b> <b>product</b> {{created by}} the natural process of rocks {{weathering}} in the hot humid climatic conditions and interaction with water, oxygen and carbon dioxide. In simple terms, it is a soil formation linked to the parent rock material that has evolved because of various powers of nature {{in the same manner}} as other types of soils such as alluvial soil, regular soil and red soil. It is also inferred that paleoclimate dating back several million years has been a causative factor in laterite formation. The residue usually consists of enriched iron, aluminum and titanium oxides in varying proportions. The residue is pitted and porous in appearance. Buchanan, who discovered this formation in Kerala, in his report of 1807 observed: It is diffused in immense masses, without any appearance of stratification and is placed over the granite that forms the basis of Malayala. It is full of cavities and pores and contains a large quantity of iron in the form of red and yellow ochres. In the mass, while excluded from air, it is so soft, that any iron instrument readily cuts it, and it is dug up in square masses with a pick-axe, and immediately cut into the shape wanted with a trowel or a large knife. It, very soon after, becomes as hard as brick, and resists air and water much better than any bricks that I have seen in India… ...|$|E
