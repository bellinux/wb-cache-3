5|$|The {{investigators}} also {{requested that}} Fokker conduct {{a study of}} the effects of ice contamination and pilot technique on the F28 aircraft. The NTSB evaluated the data from the tests and found that the pilot initiated the rotation five knots earlier at 119 knots instead of the proper <b>rotation</b> <b>speed</b> of 124 knots. The data from Fokker was correlated with the cockpit voice recording and confirmed that the first officer called a <b>rotation</b> <b>speed</b> of 113 knots but the captain did not rotate until 119 knots. It was never established why the rotation was called and initiated earlier than was standard.|$|E

A concept known as the universal rotation curve of spirals, moreover, shows that the problem is ubiquitous in these objects.|$|E
40|$|Effect of the {{polishing}} plane vibration on large-size optical workpieces {{in continuous}} polishing is studied. The vibration equation was deduced {{based on the}} existence of inclination between the polishing plane and z-axis direction. Influences of different parameters, such as the inclination, <b>rotation</b> <b>speeds</b> of the polishing plane and workpiece, the eccentricity and workpiece radius, on the polishing plane vibration were simulated. The simulations results show that <b>rotation</b> <b>speeds</b> of the polishing plane and workpiece is the most significant factor. The chaotic vibration of the polishing plane increases with increasing <b>rotation</b> <b>speeds</b> differences between the polishing plane and workpiece. When differences are small, periodic {{ups and downs of the}} polishing plane occur with the increase of polishing time.

5|$|The Leslie was {{originally}} designed to mimic the complex tones and constantly shifting sources of sound emanating from {{a large group of}} ranks in a pipe organ. The effect varies depending on the speed of the rotors, which can be toggled between fast (tremolo) and slow (chorale) using a console half-moon or pedal switch, with the most distinctive effect occurring as the speaker <b>rotation</b> <b>speed</b> changes. The most popular Leslies were the 122, which accepted a balanced signal suitable for console organs, and the 147, which accepted an unbalanced signal and could be used for spinet organs with a suitable adapter. The Pro-Line series of Leslies which were made to be portable for gigging bands using solid-state amps were popular during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|In 1848–49, Hippolyte Fizeau {{determined}} {{the speed of}} light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8km distant. The light source was interrupted by a rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could be rotated at a variable speed of up to hundreds of times a second. (Figure1) Fizeau adjusted the <b>rotation</b> <b>speed</b> of the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. Spinning the cogwheel at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the reflected light by the cogwheel teeth next in line. Given the rotational speed of the wheel and the distance between the wheel and the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000km/s for {{the speed of light}}. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's speed was about 5% too high. Fizeau's paper appeared in Comptes Rendus: Hebdomadaires de scéances de l’Academie de Sciences (Paris, Vol. 29 , pp.90–92).|$|E

25|$|There are two tool speeds to be {{considered}} in friction-stir welding; how fast the tool rotates and how quickly it traverses along the interface. These two parameters have considerable importance and must be chosen with care to ensure a successful and efficient welding cycle. The relationship between the <b>rotation</b> <b>speed,</b> the welding speed and the heat input during welding is complex but, in general, {{it can be said that}} increasing the <b>rotation</b> <b>speed</b> or decreasing the traverse speed will result in a hotter weld. In order to produce a successful weld it is necessary that the material surrounding the tool is hot enough to enable the extensive plastic flow required and minimize the forces acting on the tool. If the material is too cold then voids or other flaws may be present in the stir zone and in extreme cases the tool may break.|$|E
25|$|Because the Earth's <b>rotation</b> <b>speed</b> {{varies in}} {{response}} to climatic and geological events, UTC leap seconds are irregularly spaced and unpredictable.

25|$|In {{studying}} coin flipping, {{to observe}} the <b>rotation</b> <b>speed</b> of coin flips, Diaconis first used a strobe light and a coin with one side painted black, the other white, {{so that when the}} speed of the strobe flash equaled the rotation rate of the coin, it would appear to always show the same side. This proved difficult to use, and rotation rate was more accurately computed by attaching floss to a coin, such that it would wind around the coin – after a flip, one could count rotations by unwinding the floss, and then compute rotation rate as flips over air time.|$|E
25|$|The {{equatorial}} region has a faster <b>rotation</b> <b>speed</b> than the polar zones. The {{result of the}} Sun's differential rotation is that the active regions always arise in two bands parallel to the equator and their extension increases during the periods of maximum of the solar cycle, while they almost disappear during each minimum. Therefore, the quiet Sun always coincides with the equatorial zone and its surface is less active during the maximum of the solar cycle. Approaching the minimum of the solar cycle (also named butterfly cycle), {{the extension of the}} quiet Sun increases until it covers the whole disk surface excluding some bright points on the hemisphere and the poles, where there are the coronal holes.|$|E

25|$|This disc rotates {{at a fixed}} {{specific}} speed, set by the user. Each disc <b>rotation</b> <b>speed</b> is set to {{a particular}} frequency of the desired note. If the note being played (and making the lamps behind the disc flash) is {{at exactly the same}} frequency as the spinning of the disc, then the disc appears to be static (due to the persistence of vision) from the strobing effect. If the note is out of tune then the pattern appears to be moving as the light flashing and the disc rotation are out of sync from each other. The more out of tune the played note is, the faster the pattern seems to be moving, although in reality it always spins at the same speed for a given note. Many good turntables for vinyl disc records have stroboscopic patterns lit by the incoming AC power (mains). The power frequency, either 50 or 60Hz, serves as the reference, although commercial power frequency sometimes changes slightly (a few tenths of a percent) with varying load. Unless reference and measured quantity are interchanged, the operating principle is the same; the turntable speed is adjusted to stop drifting of the pattern.|$|E
