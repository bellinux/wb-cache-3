40|$|Recently {{there have}} been several {{examples}} of different <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> systems intervening to prevent unconstitutional events. The interventions can be based on explicit powers or be developed in response to events. This happens despite most <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> systems having economic cooperation rather than explicit democratisation aims. Organs that issue laws or take constraining decisions must have a clear right to do this and a basis for exercising power-in other words, be legitimate. Where legitimacy comes from is debated, but as most countries today are democracies or purport to be, it somehow emanates from the people. National governments have a higher degree of legitimacy than <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> <b>organisations,</b> possibly except the European Union. <b>Regional</b> <b>integration</b> <b>organisations</b> have to prove their legitimacy. The article examines if, to what extent, and on what basis <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> systems have the right to exercise an independent role on the global stage. Legitimacy is a precondition for effective application of decisions of the organisation. Given the frequent lack of strong enforcement mechanisms, the question of legitimacy becomes even more important. With strong legitimacy, decisions taken by the <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> <b>organisation</b> will be followed to a large extent even despite absence of effective enforcement mechanisms...|$|R

While believing that an agreement can still be reached before September, the meeting insisted that 'the EU side seriously engage in the first-phase negotiations and demonstrate a willingness to overcome the divergences that have emerged'. The meeting stressed the importance of 'strengthening of ACP countries' production and supply capacities' and addressing the physical constraints on competitiveness. In this context the importance of the development dimension to the negotiations was stressed.

Comment: Significantly in its dialogue with non-state actors EC officials stressed 90 % product coverage as a defining criterion for WTO compatibility. This occurred in response to questioning on how the Commission intended to accommodate the needs of least developed countries. The treatment of LDCs under the SADC Trade Protocol was highlighted. Here LDCs are expected to liberalise only 70 % of their imports from South Africa (a country classified as a developed country under WTO rules). This, it is felt, allows them to better accommodate the needs of sensitive sectors in the light of the very real constraints which they face. EC representatives explicitly ruled out this option under future EPAs involving LDCs, maintaining that this would be incompatible with WTO rules.

40|$|Abstract Background Transnational tobacco {{companies}} (TTCs) may respond to processes of <b>regional</b> trade <b>integration</b> both by acting politically to influence policy and by reorganising their own operations. The Central American Common Market (CACM) was reinvigorated in the 1990 s, reflecting processes of regional trade liberalisation in Latin America and globally. This study aimed to ascertain how British American Tobacco (BAT), which dominated the markets of the CACM, sought to influence policy towards it by member country governments {{and how the}} CACM process impacted upon BAT's operations. Methods The study analysed internal tobacco industry documents released {{as a result of}} litigation in the US and available from the online Legacy Tobacco Documents Library at [URL]. Documents were retrieved by searching the BAT collection using key terms in an iterative process. Analysis was based on an interpretive approach involving a process of attempting to understand the meanings of individual documents and relating these to other documents in the set, identifying the central themes of documents and clusters of documents, contextualising the documentary data, and choosing representative material in order to present findings. Results Utilising its multinational character, BAT was able to act in a coordinated way across the member countries of the CACM to influence tariffs and taxes to its advantage. Documents demonstrate a high degree of access to governments and officials. The company conducted a coordinated, and largely successful, attempt to keep external tariff rates for cigarettes high and to reduce external tariffs for key inputs, whilst also influencing the harmonisation of excise taxes between countries. Protected by these high external tariffs, it reorganised its own operations to take advantage of regional economies of scale. In direct contradiction to arguments presented to CACM governments that affording the tobacco industry protection via high cigarette tariffs would safeguard employment, the company's regional reorganisation involved the loss of hundreds of jobs.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} examine the motivations for the European Union’s (EU) policy towards the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), the EU’s most {{important}} relationship with another <b>regional</b> economic <b>integration</b> <b>organisation.</b> As such, the EUMercosur relationship has a prominent place {{in the literature on}} the EU as a global actor. This thesis argues that the dominant explanations in the literature [...] balancing the US, global aspirations, being an external federator, long-standing economic and cultural ties, economic interdependence, and the Europeanization of Spanish and Portuguese national foreign policies – fail to adequately explain the EU’s policy. In particular, these accounts tend to infer the EU’s motives from its activity. Drawing extensive primary documents, this thesis argues that the major developments in the relationship [...] the 1992 Interinstitutional Agreement and the 1995 Europe Mercosur Inter-regional Framework Cooperation Agreement – were initiated by Mercosur. Moreover, a free trade agreement was included in the latter agreement which negotiations finally started in 1999 due to the insistence of Mercosur. This means that rather than the EU pursuing a strategy, as implied by most of the existing literature, the EU was largely responsive. How it responded to Mercosur’s overtures, however, has been influenced by some of the factors highlighted in the literature, most notably the Europeanisation of Portuguese and, particularly, Spanish foreign policies. Also the Commission’s role as external federator has influenced as well, although to a lesser extent. Overall, however, these supposedly causal factors have provided only a very weak impetus for EU policy, which explains in large part why the relationship is much less developed than the EU’s relations with other parts of the world. Beyond providing a distinctive and empirically rich account of the EU’s relationship with Mercosur, this thesis contributes to the literature on the EU as a global actor, particularly {{the extent to which it}} is a strategic actor, and to the literature on Europeanization of national foreign policies of member states from a bottom-up perspective with the case of Spain and Portugal...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the legal {{effects of a}} seemingly paradoxical situation: an international agreement falls {{at least in part}} within the exclusive competence of the Community, and yet the Member States are parties to the agreement and the Community is not. This situation, while not common, is not as unusual as we might imagine. It may occur for several reasons: it may be decided that it is in the Community interest, for political or other reasons, that the Member States rather than the Community should participate; it may be the case that only States, and not <b>regional</b> economic <b>integration</b> <b>organisations</b> (REIOs) such as the EC, are entitled to participate; it may be that when the agreement was originally concluded the Member States were competent - since then, however, EC exclusivity has ‘supervened’. In cases such as these the European Court of Justice has taken the view that the Member States party to the agreement are acting on behalf of the Community, and in its interests. The legal questions explored in this paper arise out {{of the fact that the}} international agreement is not formally a ‘Community agreement’ within the scope of Article 300 EC and thus the matters regulated by that provision, including the binding nature of the agreement as far as the Community is concerned, and its place in the Community legal order, are not expressly resolved. Although these agreements are in some senses anomalous, and their position in the Community legal order may be ambiguous, they also illustrate the constraints under which the Member States – although fully sovereign States – may operate as a result of their Community obligations, the way in which the international identity of the Union may be represented by the Member States, and the accommodations possible between the demands of the Community legal order and the practical exigencies of international treaty-making.
