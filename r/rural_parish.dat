5|$|The spit {{sheltered}} the Glaven ports, Blakeney, Cley-next-the-Sea and Wiveton, {{which were}} important medieval harbours. Blakeney sent ships to help Edward I's war efforts in 1301, {{and between the}} 14th and 16th centuries {{it was the only}} Norfolk port between King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth to have customs officials. Blakeney Church has a second tower at its east end, an unusual feature in a <b>rural</b> <b>parish</b> church. It has been suggested that it acted as a beacon for mariners, perhaps by aligning it with the taller west tower to guide ships into the navigable channel between the inlet's sandbanks; that this was not always successful is demonstrated by a number of wrecks in the haven, including a carvel-built wooden ship.|$|E

He was missionary at St Augustine's Mission at Moulmein, Burma 1927–1929. He was {{principal}} of the Divinity School at Kokine, Pegu, Burma 1930–1933. He had a furlough between 1933 and 1934, then he was Superintendent at St Michael's Delta Mission from 1934 to 1939. He was then chaplain of Bassein and examining chaplain to the Bishop of Rangoon from 1934 to 1939 when the diocese was overrun by the Imperial Japanese Army. This is why he suddenly returned to England to become vicar of the <b>rural</b> <b>parish</b> of Thurstonland and chaplain of Storthes Hall 1939–1943, with an income of £375 and house, and a parish population of 3458. He subsequently became chaplain of the then-expanding parish of St Mary Magdalen, Knighton 1943–1945. He was chaplain of St Barnabas, Hove, Sussex from 1945 to 1947. He was vicar of Stone Cross 1947–1951, and vicar of Airedale with Fryston 1951 to 1953. He was rector of Hoggeston with Dunton 1953–1956, and vicar of Whaddon with Tattenhoe 1956–1962.

500|$|Hebel {{lived in}} Karlsruhe until his death, but made {{occasional}} journeys to other regions. His wish {{to become a}} parish priest in Wiesental was never fulfilled, though he wrote an inaugural sermon for a <b>rural</b> <b>parish</b> in 1820. In this sermon he wrote, [...] "to live and die as a pastor in a peaceful country town, among honest people, has always been my sole wish, up to this hour; it was what I wished for in the happiest and in the darkest moments of my life". Instead, he was [...] "led higher and higher by an invisible hand, ever further away from my modest goals". In 1805 he was offered the Lutheran parish of Freiburg im Breisgau, but he declined it {{at the behest of}} Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden. He was rewarded in 1808 with his appointment as director of the Gymnasium in Karlsruhe. In 1819 he became a prelate of the Lutheran regional church, a leading position that brought with it a seat in the Upper House of the Parliament (Ständeversammlung) of Baden. As a member of parliament he devoted himself mainly to education, the church and social policy. He later gave a speech at the consecration of the statehouse in Karlsruhe. Even though the Lutheran and Reformed regional churches of Baden merged in 1821 with strong support from his side, into today's Evangelische Landeskirche in Baden, his position as the prelate of the unified Protestant church was not endangered.|$|E

The resulting counties were divided up into larger land owners, representatives of towns and representatives of <b>rural</b> <b>parishes.</b> In 1928 the county of Lüneburg was divided into 71 <b>rural</b> <b>parishes.</b> At the head of the county created in 1867 stood a Landrat, who was not an elected president, but a Prussian official.

[...] A series of medieval expansions doubled its size by the 15th century, and the present building has changed little since then—despite a Victorian restoration overseen by architect R. H. Carpenter. [...] A major addition was the heavily buttressed Perpendicular Gothic west tower, topped with a tall broach spire and containing a peal of ancient bells. [...] The large, steeply terraced churchyard also serves as a public cemetery and has far-reaching views across the Weald. [...] The original dedication to Saint Margaret of Antioch fell out of use for many centuries until a researcher rediscovered it. [...] The church serves a large <b>rural</b> <b>parish</b> which was reduced in size in 1882 when two residents of the hamlet of Highbrook paid for an additional church to be built there.
