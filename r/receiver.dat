Close behind was wide <b>receiver</b> Willie Haulstead, who had three receptions for 73yards.

It was extremely important to replace these <b>receivers,</b> as they form the primary traceability link for time in South Africa. Several options were available to the CSIR-NML. These included replacing the firmware of the AOA <b>receivers,</b> purchasing new timing <b>receivers</b> and designing and building <b>receivers</b> in-house. The replacement of the firmware of the AOA <b>receivers</b> was ruled out due to costs {{and the age of}} the <b>receivers.</b> The purchase of new timing <b>receivers</b> was ruled out due to cost.

Three of these <b>receivers</b> are derived by optimally combining the channel estimates using the reference symbols, the data decisions {{and the data}} symbols.

5|$|A feature {{coming into}} wide use in modern shortwave {{receivers}} is DSP technology, short for digital signal processing. DSP {{is the use}} of digital means to process signals, and a primary benefit in shortwave receivers is the ability to tailor the bandwidth of the <b>receiver</b> to current reception conditions and to the type of signal being listened to. A typical analog-only <b>receiver</b> may have a limited number of fixed bandwidths, or only one, but a DSP <b>receiver</b> may have 40 or more individually selectable filters.|$|E

In addition, Hall was the Hokies' starting punt returner, and had returned 40kicks for 510yards and one touchdown, setting a school record for punt return yardage.|$|E

40|$|A cache-aided erasure {{broadcast}} channel is studied.

Data can be pre-delivered to weak <b>receivers???</b> caches over the off-peak traffic period before the <b>receivers</b> reveal their demands. A joint caching and channel coding scheme is proposed such that all the <b>receivers,</b> even the <b>receivers</b> without any cache memories, benefit from the presence of caches across the network. The trade-off between the cache size and the achievable rate is studied, and it is shown that the proposed scheme significantly improves the achievable trade-off upon the state-of-the-art...|$|R

5|$|Callender's true success, however, was in {{the passing}} game, where he accrued 92yards, putting him first among all {{receivers}} in the game. Callender's 13catches were an ACC Championship Game record and were the fourth-highest total for a <b>receiver</b> in any game in ACC history. Wide <b>receiver</b> Kevin Challenger finished the game with 4catches for 45yards, while the Eagles' Rich Gunnell finished the game with 54yards.

40|$|GRINGO (GPS RINEX Generator) is {{a program}} that has been {{developed}} at the IESSG to record the pseudorange and carrier phase output from 12 -channel Garmin handheld GPS <b>receivers</b> in Rinex format.

We examine the sum MSE minimization and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) balancing frameworks for the selection of precoders. The performance of two frameworks with MRC <b>receivers</b> are compared between themselves as well as with their counterparts implementing MMSE <b>receivers.</b> It has been observed that the SINR balancing framework with simple MRC <b>receivers</b> has little performance loss in comparison with the MMSE <b>receivers</b> with a proper selection of precoders...|$|R

Mitchell became the slot <b>receiver</b> once again during the 2003 season, after Freeman left. In the NFC Divisional Playoff Game against the Green Bay Packers, with the Eagles facing a 4th and 26 situation, he caught a 28-yard pass from Donovan McNabb to help led the team to a win in overtime.
