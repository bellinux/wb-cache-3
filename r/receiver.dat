Close behind was wide <b>receiver</b> Willie Haulstead, who had three receptions for 73yards. All of Haulstead's receptions came in the first half, setting a record for receiving yards in an ACC Championship Game half.|$|E

It was extremely important to replace these <b>receivers,</b> as they form the primary traceability link for time in South Africa. Several options were available to the CSIR-NML. These included replacing the firmware of the AOA <b>receivers,</b> purchasing new timing <b>receivers</b> and designing and building <b>receivers</b> in-house. The replacement of the firmware of the AOA <b>receivers</b> was ruled out due to costs {{and the age of}} the <b>receivers.</b> The purchase of new timing <b>receivers</b> was ruled out due to cost.

5|$|A feature {{coming into}} wide use in modern shortwave {{receivers}} is DSP technology, short for digital signal processing. DSP {{is the use}} of digital means to process signals, and a primary benefit in shortwave receivers is the ability to tailor the bandwidth of the <b>receiver</b> to current reception conditions and to the type of signal being listened to. A typical analog-only <b>receiver</b> may have a limited number of fixed bandwidths, or only one, but a DSP <b>receiver</b> may have 40 or more individually selectable filters.|$|E

A joint caching and channel coding scheme is proposed such that all the <b>receivers,</b> even the <b>receivers</b> without any cache memories, benefit from the presence of caches across the network.
