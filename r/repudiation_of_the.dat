Borah opposed large-scale immigration by Jews from Germany, feeling that was impractical with millions of Americans unemployed. By 1938, Borah was speaking out against the continued persecutions, but still felt that the European issue could be settled if Germany's former colonies were returned. After the Munich Conference in September 1938, Borah issued a statement far more critical of Britain and France for deceiving Czechoslovakia into dismemberment, than of Germany for her aggression.|$|E

After the {{issuance}} of 150 million dollars in greenbacks—non-gold-backed currency—the {{value of the dollar}} stood at a low ebb. A bipartisan group of inflationists, led by Republican Benjamin F.

Blaine called this idea a <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation’s promise to investors, which was made when the only currency was gold. Speaking several times on the matter, Blaine said that the greenbacks had only ever been an emergency measure to avoid bankruptcy during the war. Blaine and his hard money allies were successful, but the issue remained alive until 1879, when all remaining greenbacks were made redeemable in gold by the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875.|$|E

The traditional view of historians is that these events marked Michael I's <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> allegiance he had sworn to the Latin Empire, but historian Philip Van Tricht argues that both Michael and later Theodore remained, at least in theory, vassals of the Latin Empire until 1217.

5|$|The Belgians {{had taken}} {{measures}} to reconstruct their defences {{along the border}} with the German state upon Adolf Hitler's rise to power in January 1933. The Belgian government had watched with increasing alarm the German withdrawal from the League of Nations, its <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treaty of Versailles and its violation of the Locarno Treaties. The government increased expenditure on modernising the fortifications at Namur and Liège. New lines of defence were established along the Maastricht–Bois-le-Duc canal, joining the Meuse, Scheldt and the Albert Canal. The protection of the eastern frontier, based mainly on the destruction of a number of roads, was entrusted to new formations (frontier cyclist units and the newly formed Chasseurs Ardennais). By 1935, the Belgian defences had been completed. Even so, it was felt that the defences were no longer adequate. A significant mobile reserve was needed to guard the rear areas, and as a result it was considered that the protection against a sudden assault by German forces was not sufficient. Significant manpower reserves were also needed, but a bill made for the provision of longer military service and training for the army was rejected by the public on the basis that it would increase Belgium's military commitments as well as the request of the Allies to engage in conflicts far from home.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} that Haggard began writing She, society had more anxiety about <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> women.

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is to {{reconstruct}} Brouwer’s justification for <b>the</b> intuitionistic revision <b>of</b> logic and mathematics.

On <b>the</b> other hand, it is argued that his objections to some laws of classical logic result from <b>the</b> rejection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rule <b>of</b> double negation elimination, which in turn follows from both, the claim that rules of logic should preserve evidence for assertions rather than truth, and too restrictive a concept of evidence...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Chronic {{inflation}} in the U. S. is a post World War II phenomenon. Particu-larly puzzling is <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> accelerating inflation after 1964 and the rapid decelera-tion after 1981. Arguably, inflation {{was employed to}} solve certain problems of finance faced by political authorities benefiting from the expandingwelfare state. Those solu-tions depended on certain deceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public, however. In particular, success-ful vote maximization through redistributive politics required (1) taxing and raising taxes surreptitiously through inflation to hide <b>the</b> costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subsidies, (2) covert in-flationary <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accumulating federal debt that was also being employed to hide <b>the</b> costs <b>of</b> redistribution, and (3) <b>the</b> successful use <b>of</b> inflation to reduce <b>the</b> disemployment effects <b>of</b> pro-union laws and income transfers. Accom-plishing these things required accelerating inflation. Inflation stopped accomplishing its intended functions over the 1970 s, however, because <b>the</b> public’s expectations <b>of</b> inflation became more accurate despite its acceleration, and certain costs of inflation rose. Thus <b>the</b> marginal benefits <b>of</b> inflationary policy to <b>the</b> governmental partisans <b>of</b> <b>the</b> welfare state fell below the marginal political costs, making a lower inflation rate optimal. This endogenous theory of monetary policy and inflation behavior may be termed the “political neutralization hypothesis”...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine 105 {{successive}} negligence {{claims against}} NHS accident and emergency (A&E) {{departments in the}} United Kingdom and to highlight risk management points. METHODS: A systematic review of sociodemographic, clinical, and legal issues was conducted on each claim. RESULTS: 54 claims involved <b>the</b> missed diagnosis <b>of</b> a fracture because of failure to x ray or to interpret the films correctly; 27 claims alleged a missed or delayed diagnosis other than fracture and were mainly due to incomplete clinical examination or failure to x ray or to interpret the films correctly; 24 claims alleged clinical mismanagement in the A&E department; in 82 claims (78 %) an SHO was allegedly responsible for the mistake. By <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> August 1996, 92 claims (87. 6 %) had been closed, of which 38 had been settled out of Court and 54 had not been pursued by the patient after disclosure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> records and [...] where appropriate [...] a <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> liability. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 13 claims remaining open, seven {{are considered to be}} defensible and six will have to be settled. CONCLUSIONS: SHOs employed in A&E departments need careful training and supervision, with ready access to senior medical advice, both clinical and radiological. Most errors leading to claims appear in retrospect to have been simple failures of history taking, physical examination, interpretation of radiographs, and communication. Poor quality notes imply substandard care. About half the claims were found to be indefensible...|$|R

On November 24, 1970, he refused a second offer from Nixon due to potential familial strain and ongoing financial problems; depression stemming from the <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Family Assistance Plan by liberal Democrats; and the inability to effect change due to static policy directives in a tertiary role behind Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Henry Kissinger and United States Secretary of State William P.

The treaty had produced ten years of peace and highly lucrative trade for American merchants, but Jefferson was still opposed.

Although the treaty called for ten more years of trade between the United States and the British Empire and gave American merchants guarantees {{that would have been}} good for business, Jefferson was unhappy that it did not end the hated British practice of impressment, and refused to give up the potential weapon of commercial warfare against Britain. The president made no attempt to obtain another treaty, and as a result, the two nations drifted from peace toward the War of 1812. Monroe was severely pained by the administration's <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treaty, and he fell out with Secretary of State James Madison.|$|E

25|$|Some slaveholders made {{a profit}} by selling surplus slaves to traders for {{transport}} {{to the markets}} of the Deep South, where the demand was still high for field hands on cotton plantations. In contrast to the near-unanimity of voters in the seven cotton states in the lower South, which held {{the highest number of}} slaves, the border slave states were bitterly divided about secession and were not eager to leave the Union. Border Unionists hoped that a compromise would be reached, and they assumed that Lincoln would not send troops to attack the South. Border secessionists paid less attention to the slavery issue in 1861, since their states' economies were based more on trade with the North than on cotton. Their main concern in 1861 was federal coercion; some residents viewed Lincoln's call to arms as a <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American traditions of states' rights, democracy, liberty, and a republican form of government. Secessionists insisted that Washington had usurped illegitimate powers in defiance of the Constitution, and thereby had lost its legitimacy. After Lincoln issued a call for troops, Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, and North Carolina promptly seceded and joined the Confederacy. A secession movement began in western Virginia, where most farmers were yeomen and not slaveholders, to break away and remain in the Union.|$|E
25|$|Such a {{conclusion}} led Heidegger {{to depart from}} the phenomenology of his teacher Husserl and prompt instead an (ironically anachronistic) return to the yet-unasked questions of Ontology, a return that in general did not acknowledge an intrinsic distinction between phenomena and noumena or between things in themselves (de re) and things as they appear (see qualia): Being-in-the-world, or rather, the openness {{to the process of}} Daseins becoming was to bridge the age-old gap between these two. In this latter premise, Heidegger shares an affinity with the late Romantic philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, another principal forerunner of post-structuralist and postmodernist thought. Influential to thinkers associated with Postmodernism are Heidegger's critique of the subject–object or sense–knowledge division implicit in Rationalism, Empiricism, and methodological naturalism, his <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idea that facts exist outside or separately from the process of thinking and speaking them (however, Heidegger is not specifically a nominalist), his related admission that the possibilities of philosophical and scientific discourse are wrapped up in the practices and expectations of a society and that concepts and fundamental constructs are the expression of a lived, historical exercise rather than simple derivations of external, a priori conditions independent from historical mind and changing experience (see Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Heinrich von Kleist, Weltanschauung, and social constructionism), and his instrumentalist and negativist notion that Being (and, by extension, reality) is an action, method, tendency, possibility, and question rather than a discrete, positive, identifiable state, answer, or entity (see also process philosophy, dynamism, Instrumentalism, Pragmatism, and Vitalism).|$|E
25|$|F64.2 Gender {{identity}} {{disorder of}} childhood: A disorder, usually first manifest during early childhood (and always well before puberty), {{characterized by a}} persistent and intense distress about assigned sex, together {{with a desire to}} be (or insistence that one is) of the other sex. There is a persistent preoccupation with the dress and activities of the opposite sex and <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual's own sex. The diagnosis requires a profound disturbance of the normal gender identity; mere tomboyishness in girls or girlish behavior in boys is not sufficient. Gender identity disorders in individuals who have reached or are entering puberty should not be classified here but in F66.0.In the DSM of mental disorders used by psychologists in the United States, gender identity disorder is given two sets of criteria. Criterion A indicates that a child identifies {{as a member of the}} opposite sex. The child needs to demonstrate four of the five following symptoms: dressing as a member of the opposite sex, primarily befriending members of the opposite sex, demonstrating a desire to engage in play activities characteristic of the opposite sex, and actively stating that they wish to be the opposite sex. Criterion B, on the other hand, indicates that the child does not identify with the sex they were born. This could manifest itself as a dislike of styles of dress characteristic of the sex they were born, avoidance of association with members of their born sex, and distress towards the aspects of their physiology which indicate their born gender (Bradley, Zucker, 1997).|$|E
