40|$|A {{systematic}} review {{relevant to the}} following research questions was conducted (1) {{the extent to which}} different theoretical frameworks have been applied to food risk/benefit communication and (2) the impact such food risk/benefit communication interventions have had on related risk/benefit attitudes and behaviors. Fifty four papers were identified. The analysis revealed that (primarily European or US) research interest has been relatively recent. Certain food issues were of greater interest to researchers than others, perhaps reflecting the occurrence of a crisis, or policy concern. Three broad themes relevant to the development of best practice in <b>risk</b> (benefit) <b>communication</b> were identified: the characteristics of the target population; the contents of the information; and the characteristics of the information sources. Within these themes, independent and dependent variables differed considerably. Overall, acute <b>risk</b> (benefit) <b>communication</b> will require advances in communication process whereas chronic communication needs to identify audience requirements. Both citizen's risk/benefit perceptions and (if relevant) related behaviors need to be taken into account, and recommendations for behavioral change need to be concrete and actionable. The application of theoretical frameworks to the study of <b>risk</b> (benefit) <b>communication</b> was infrequent, and developing predictive models of effective <b>risk</b> (benefit) <b>communication</b> may be contingent on improved theoretical perspectives. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract With advancements in {{modernization}} {{came the}} infiltration {{of information and}} communication technologies across the world, Nigeria inclusive. Several benefits are obtainable from these but also prevalent are some associated <b>risks.</b> <b>Communication</b> exists massively in cyberspace and as such poses a myriad of threats to a nation. This can be addressed on a national spectrum by the implementation of cyber security policies and strategies. This research involves making a qualitative analysis of the current Nigerian National Cyber Security Policy and Strategy. The documents were analyzed in the light of selected harmonized strategy developmental frameworks and subsequently comparatively evaluated with similar documents of selected countries. After the analysis, the national documents were found to have met majority of the requirements in terms of content, but failed to address certain elements of concern to cyber security in the Nigerian environment...|$|R

An early warning system {{is much more than}} a forecast-it is a linked risk information (including peoples’ perception of <b>risk)</b> and <b>communication</b> system that actively engages communities involved in preparedness. The successes illustrate that effective early warning depends upon a multi-sectoral and interdisciplinary collaboration among all concerned actors at each stage in the warning process from monitoring to response and evaluation. However, the links between the community-based approach and the national and global EWSs are relatively weak.

This project focuses on <b>risk</b> <b>communication</b> at the organizational level by “exploring how communications within and among organizations affect risk management and <b>risk</b> <b>communication</b> about bioterrorism." [...] This project aims to improve communication about bioterrorism between organizations and their public. For this study, researchers {{focused on the}} anthrax attacks of 2001. The researchers conducted over 50 interviews with local {{people who were in}} positions with agency such as law enforcement officers, elected officials, and health professionals. Researchers asked the participants to describe how decisions were made in their organizations and how information was communicated from their organizations. Forms of written communication such as electronic correspondence and reports were also analyzed. This study produced 5 major findings. The first is “Organizations faced both technical and social uncertainties." [...] These uncertainties included that the authorities in the situation were unclear, and these uncertainties negatively affected <b>risk</b> <b>communication.</b> The second major finding of this study is “Organizational networks were essential for <b>risk</b> <b>communication</b> to the public and workers." [...] This means that successful <b>risk</b> <b>communication</b> depends on how effective the communication process is between agencies. The third major finding is “Relationships among local professional first responders and public health agencies were often constructive." [...] Informal methods of communication between law enforcement officers and health professionals help facilitate communication to the public. The fourth major finding is, “Communication problems resulted from lack of communication triage." [...] This means that organizations did not prioritize their many audiences or their channels for reaching those audiences. The fifth and final major finding is, “The concept of elite panic needs further conceptualizing and research." [...] Researchers noticed the concept of elite panic during the interview analysis process. This concept needs to be better understood to improve crisis communication.|$|E
40|$|Although {{considerable}} {{progress has}} been made in understanding the determinants of risk perception and in identifying the necessary components of effective food <b>risk</b> and benefit <b>communication,</b> this has not been matched with the development of efficient and appropriate communication tools. Little work has been done examining the implications of the explosion of new media and web technologies, which may offer potential for improving food <b>risk</b> and benefit <b>communication.</b> First, this study examines the views of stakeholders (n= 38) and experts (n= 33) in the food domain on the potential use of these emerging media for food risk/benefit communication. Based on in-depth interviews in six European countries (Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Spain and The Netherlands), strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of social media in food <b>risk</b> and benefit <b>communication</b> were identified. Second, a Strategic Orientation Round (SOR) was used to evaluate the relative importance of the SWOT components according to stakeholders (n= 10) and experts (n= 13). Results show that both stakeholders and experts confirm a future role of social media in food <b>risk</b> and benefit <b>communication.</b> Strengths as speed, accessibility and interaction make social media an interesting tool in crisis communication or issue awareness raising. Weaknesses as the lack of a filter, low trust, the risk of information overload and a communication preference for traditional media are acknowledge...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the <b>risk</b> of <b>communication</b> impairments at age 18 and 36  months in children born early term (gestational weeks 37 - 38) and late preterm (gestational weeks 34 - 36). Study designA total of 39   423 {{children and their}} mothers participated in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. The sample included 7109 children (18 %) born early term and 1673 (4. 2 %) born late preterm. Information on gestational age and prenatal and postnatal risk factors {{was obtained from the}} Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Information on communication impairments was assessed using standardized questionnaires filled out by the mothers. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was applied to explore the associations between early term/late preterm birth and communication impairments at age 18 and 36  months. ResultsCompared with children born at term, children born early term and late preterm had an increased <b>risk</b> of <b>communication</b> impairments at age 18 and 36  months. In early term, the aOR was 1. 27 (95 % CI, 1. 12 - 1. 44) at 18  months for communication impairments and 1. 22 (95 % CI, 1. 07 - 1. 39) at 36  months for expressive language impairments. In late preterm, the aOR was 1. 74 (95 % CI, 1. 41 - 2. 14) at 18  months and 1. 37 (95 % CI, 1. 09 - 1. 73) at 36  months. ConclusionNot only children born late preterm, but also those born early term, are at increased <b>risk</b> for <b>communication</b> impairments. Given the large number of children potentially affected, this may result in significant health care costs...|$|R

40|$|The study {{identifies}} {{the increase in}} populations at <b>risk</b> for <b>communication</b> disorders world-wide and in South Africa as one the reasons for research to develop early communication intervention (ECI) services as a societal responsibility in South Africa. Since ECI is largely an unknown entity in the South African health system, but shares several mutual objectives, the dire need for data of populations at-risk validates {{the development of a}} computer-based relational data system as a 21 st century research tool for ECI. Underpinnings {{for the development of a}} research database for ECI were obtained from the use of database management systems for early intervention in the USA, identified as leaders in the application of database technology in the field of Speech-Language Pathology. The aim of the study was to develop and establish a computerized database system to describe the characteristics of young children at <b>risk</b> for <b>communication</b> disorders enrolled in an existing ECI programme. Using a descriptive survey as research design, a rich description of 153 subjects and their families was obtained. The findings relating to the multiple risk profiles of the subjects revealed results not extensively described or emphasized in the literature, indicating the in-depth analysis of results that is possible when utilizing a database approach to research. The complex risk profile found in the subgroup of subjects with cleft lip and palate is an example of a need for further investigation. The results also indicated the critical importance of early identification of risk events throughout a child’s life to improve the efficacy of ECI services. Further results emphasized the important role of parents to identify the early signs of <b>risks</b> for <b>communication</b> disorders in their children, provided they are equipped with the necessary knowledge. A conceptual framework for the early identification of <b>risks</b> for <b>communication</b> disorders is proposed for best practice in ECI in South Africa. The study concluded that the CHRIB database system was successfully applied in the empirical research and is now established as a versatile 21 st century research tool to be utilized in second generation research in ECI in South Africa.
