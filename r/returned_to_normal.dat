Zinc therapy is continued unless symptoms recur or if the urinary excretion of copper increases.|$|E

However, relief coordination was disrupted by damaged communication lines and ongoing rainfall. Rescue boats were used to rescue stranded residents. India's Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda provided 500million rupees (US$15million) to help Andhra Pradesh with flood recovery. Conditions <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>normal</b> within 12days of the onslaught of the rains, {{with the exception of}} minor delays to trains. However, another cyclone struck Andhra Pradesh about three weeks after the flood event, killing over 1,000people.|$|E

5|$|Before {{developing}} into Tropical Depression Nine, {{the precursor}} tropical wave dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across the Lesser Antilles. The depression caused moderate rainfall in Puerto Rico, where {{two to three}} inches (50 to 75mm) of precipitation were recorded.

A river in northeastern Puerto Rico surpassed its banks from flooding, though it <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>normal</b> levels within hours.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1871 life in Paris had <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>normal,</b> and Offenbach {{ended his}} {{voluntary}} exile. His new works Le roi Carotte (1872) and La jolie parfumeuse (1873) were modestly profitable, but lavish revivals of his earlier successes did better business. He {{decided to go back}} into theatre management and took over the Théâtre de la Gaîté in July 1873. His spectacular revival of Orphée aux enfers there was highly profitable; an attempt to repeat that success with a new, lavish version of Geneviève de Brabant proved less popular. Along with the costs of extravagant productions, collaboration with the dramatist Victorien Sardou culminated in financial disaster. An expensive production of Sardou's La haine in 1874, with incidental music by Offenbach, failed to attract the public to the Gaîté, and Offenbach was forced to sell his interests in the Gaîté and to mortgage future royalties.|$|E
5|$|Despite her {{relative}} inexperience, Leigh {{was chosen}} to play Ophelia to Olivier's Hamlet in an Old Vic Theatre production staged at Elsinore, Denmark.

She was able to perform without mishap, and by the following day she had <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>normal</b> with no recollection of the event. It {{was the first time}} Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her. They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce. Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.|$|E
