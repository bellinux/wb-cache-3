5|$|The {{search for}} Gliese 3634 b {{started with a}} single {{exposure}} taken with HARPS on March 25, 2009. The results helped verify that Gliese 3634 was an ideal target for a planet search using the radial velocity method (in which the gravitational pull of a planet on its star is measured by observing the resulting Doppler shift), as stellar activity would not overly mask or mimic Doppler spectroscopy measurements. It was also confirmed that Gliese 3634 is neither a binary star nor a quickly <b>rotating</b> <b>star,</b> common false positives when searching for transiting planets. Gliese 3634 was observed two weeks later for ten consecutive nights. Analysis of the resulting data found that the radial velocity variations most likely indicated {{the existence of a}} planet.|$|E

40|$|Interpretation of {{interferometric}} {{observations of}} rapidly <b>rotating</b> <b>stars</b> requires a good model of their surface effective temperature. Until now, {{laws of the}} form T_eff ∝ g_eff^β have been used, but they are only valid for slowly <b>rotating</b> <b>stars.</b> We propose a simple model that can describe the latitudinal variations in the flux of <b>rotating</b> <b>stars</b> at any rotation rate. This model assumes that the energy flux is a divergence-free vector that is antiparallel to the effective gravity. When mass distribution can be described by a Roche model, the latitudinal variations in the effective temperature only depend on a single parameter, namely {{the ratio of the}} equatorial velocity to the Keplerian velocity. We validate this model by comparing its predictions to those of the most realistic two-dimensional models of <b>rotating</b> <b>stars</b> issued from the ESTER code. The agreement is very good, as it is with the observations of two rapidly <b>rotating</b> <b>stars,</b> α Aql and α Leo. We suggest that as long as a gray atmosphere can be accepted, the inversion of data on flux distribution coming from interferometric observations of <b>rotating</b> <b>stars</b> uses such a model, which has just one free parameter...|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the immense}} {{distances}} of most gamma-ray burst sources from Earth, {{identification of the}} progenitors, the systems that produce these explosions, is challenging. The association of some long GRBs with supernovae {{and the fact that}} their host galaxies are rapidly star-forming offer very strong evidence that long gamma-ray bursts are associated with massive stars. The most widely accepted mechanism for the origin of long-duration GRBs is the collapsar model, in which the core of an extremely massive, low-metallicity, rapidly <b>rotating</b> <b>star</b> collapses into a black hole {{in the final stages of}} its evolution. Matter near the star's core rains down towards the center and swirls into a high-density accretion disk. The infall of this material into a black hole drives a pair of relativistic jets out along the rotational axis, which pummel through the stellar envelope and eventually break through the stellar surface and radiate as gamma rays. Some alternative models replace the black hole with a newly formed magnetar, although most other aspects of the model (the collapse of the core of a massive star and the formation of relativistic jets) are the same.|$|E

25|$|Based {{upon the}} star's spectrum, {{it has a}} stellar {{classification}} of A3Va, with the luminosity class 'Va' indicating this is a particularly luminous dwarf, a main sequence star that is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. The effective temperature of Denebola's outer envelope is about 8,500K, which results in the white hue typical of A-type stars. Denebola has a high projected rotational velocity of 128km/s, which is of the same order of magnitude as for the very rapidly <b>rotating</b> <b>star</b> Achernar.

An active star, it has prominent stellar flares that average 100times stronger than those of the Sun, and are emitting energy mainly in the X-ray and ultraviolet bands of the spectrum. AT Microscopii is a binary star system, both members of which are flare star red dwarfs. The system lies close to and may form a very wide triple system with AU Microscopii, a young star which appears to be a planetary system in the making with a debris disk.

Also called simply [...] "Meridiana", it is a white main sequence star located 130 light years away from Earth, with an apparent magnitude of 4.10 and spectral type A2Va. A rapidly <b>rotating</b> <b>star,</b> it spins at almost 200km per second at its equator, making a complete revolution in around 14 hours.

[...] It is currently a main-sequence star, but will eventually evolve into a white dwarf; currently, it has a luminosity 31 times greater, and a radius and mass of 2.3 times that of the Sun. Beta Coronae Australis is an orange giant 510 light years from Earth. Its spectral type is K0II, and it is of apparent magnitude 4.11. Since its formation, it has evolved from a B-type star to a K-type star. Its luminosity class places it as a bright giant; its luminosity is 730 times that of the Sun, designating it one of the highest-luminosity K0-type stars visible to the naked eye. 100 million years old, it has a radius of 43 solar radii (...) and a mass of between 4.5 and 5 solar masses (...)

40|$|The {{stability}} {{properties of}} relativistic stars against gravitational collapse to black hole is a classical problem in general relativity.

The {{aim of this}} paper is to study large-scale shallow water waves in the tachoclines of rapidly <b>rotating</b> <b>stars</b> and their connection to the periodicity and the formation of starspots at high latitudes. Shallow-water magnetohydrodynamic equations were used to study the dynamics of large-scale waves at the rapidly rotating stellar tachoclines in the presence of toroidal magnetic field. Dispersion relations and latitudinal distribution of wave modes were derived. We found that low-frequency magnetic Rossby waves tend to be located at poles, but high-frequency magnetic Poincare waves are concentrated near the equator in rapidly <b>rotating</b> <b>stars.</b> These results have important implications for the evolution of the stellar wind in young Sun-like stars. Unstable magnetic Rossby waves may lead to the local enhancement of magnetic flux at high latitudes of tachoclines in rapidly <b>rotating</b> <b>stars.</b> The enhanced magnetic flux may rise upwards owing to the magnetic buoyancy in the form of tubes and appear as starspots at polar regions.
