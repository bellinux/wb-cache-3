5000|$|The muyu (...) is {{a rounded}} woodblock {{carved in the}} shape of a fish and struck with a wooden stick. It is made in various sizes and is often used in Buddhist chanting, in China as well as in other Asian nations {{including}} Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Also, in China, a small, <b>rectangular,</b> high-pitched <b>wood</b> <b>block</b> called bangzi (...) is used. This instrument is called a temple block in a Western orchestral context. Typically used in sets of four different pitches, they are sometimes called [...] "skulls" [...] by jazz players because of their globular shape [...]|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} {{defining}} {{the sections of}} the work, the <b>wood</b> <b>block</b> is scored {{in a way that}} creates a four-part form. The first and third parts of the work have a high <b>wood</b> <b>block</b> present in the scoring, which is contrasted by a low <b>wood</b> <b>block</b> in the second part, while the final part features the absence of <b>wood</b> <b>block.</b>|$|R
25|$|Haeinsa {{is a large}} {{temple in}} the South Gyeongsang province. It was {{originally}} built in 802 and home to the Tripitaka Koreana <b>wood</b> <b>blocks,</b> the oldest Buddhist wooden manuscripts in the world. The carving of these <b>wood</b> <b>blocks</b> was initiated in 1236 and completed in 1251. The <b>wood</b> <b>blocks</b> are testimony to the pious devotion of king and his people.|$|R
50|$|William A. Heiss House and Buggy Shop is a {{historic}} home located at Mifflinburg, Union County, Pennsylvania. The property includes three buildings; the house, buggy shop, and display-storage center. The house was built in 1870, and is a two-story, five-bay frame dwelling with a rear ell. The buggy shop was built in 1889, and is a two-story, <b>rectangular</b> <b>wood</b> frame building, 63 feet long and 24 feet wide. The display-storage center was built in 1895, and is a two-story, <b>rectangular</b> <b>wood</b> frame building, 33 feet long and 50 feet wide. It {{is representative of the}} buggy manufacturers who once had a notable presence in Mifflinburg.|$|R
50|$|The Quaker (Society of Friends) meetinghouse {{was built}} in 1703-04, {{consisting}} of a modest, nearly <b>rectangular</b> <b>wood</b> frame structure. An expansion to the building was added c. 1745, joining a larger two-story structure to the old one.|$|R
50|$|The garage is a <b>rectangular</b> <b>wood</b> frame {{building}} with log siding. It contains two bays, two workrooms, {{and two small}} storage rooms. It was built from 1938 to 1940, with an 450 addition to the south end in 1962.|$|R
30|$|The {{distributions}} of boron in Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) sapwood blocks treated with aqueous or methanolic boric acid [B(OH) 3] solutions were explored through Raman spectroscopy and prompt gamma-ray analysis (PGA). B(OH) 3 {{was the sole}} boron species observed in Raman spectra of the <b>wood</b> <b>blocks</b> treated with either solution. Plots of weight gain of the treated <b>wood</b> <b>blocks</b> versus boron concentration in treatment solutions {{were found to be}} linear. The results indicated that the methanolic solution makes it possible to impregnate wood with much larger amounts of boron than the aqueous solution. PGA confirmed that B(OH) 3 was highly enriched near the end grains of the treated <b>wood</b> <b>blocks.</b> Raman measurements suggested that boron content in the bulk of the <b>wood</b> <b>block</b> is not as large as expected from the weight gain of the treated <b>wood</b> <b>blocks</b> when an ordinary air-drying method is used. It was concluded that the aqueous solution impregnates the cell walls of wood with boron more easily than the methanolic solution.|$|R

30|$|The {{relationship}} between the moisture content (MC) of <b>wood</b> <b>blocks</b> and the feeding activities of two Japanese subterranean termites, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki and Reticulitermes speratus (Kolbe), was investigated with two choice tests. When three <b>wood</b> <b>blocks</b> with low MC (6 %– 12 %), middle MC (79 %– 103 %), and high MC (140 %– 182 %) were exposed to workers of C. formosanus and R. speratus in a choice test, the feeding preferences {{were found in the}} middle MC blocks for C. formosanus, and the middle and high MC blocks for R. speratus, although <b>wood</b> <b>blocks</b> of low MC were also attacked. In a second choice test, <b>wood</b> <b>blocks</b> consisting of five pieces with water-impregnated (MC: 133 %– 191 %) top, middle, or bottom piece were exposed to workers of both species. Higher consumptions were generally obtained in water-impregnated wood pieces and bottom pieces.|$|R

50|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>block</b> {{pavement}} {{may have}} originated in Russia in the 14th century, but it gained {{prominence in the}} 1820s and 1830s as a road building alternative to the irregularly surfaced cobblestone streets common during that era. <b>Wood</b> <b>block</b> was also favored because stone was scarce and wood was abundant. Additionally, horse traffic reportedly made less noise on wood-surfaced streets. However, the drawbacks of Nicolson pavement include slippery surfaces when wet or icy, and the tendency of the blocks to rut, decay, and heave due to moisture seeping between the blocks. When treated with creosote, <b>wood</b> <b>block</b> pavement would last longer, but the creosoted pavement had a noticeable unpleasant smell.|$|R
