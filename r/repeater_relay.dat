Yet, this requires reliable uninterrupted high frame-rate video streaming. In this contribution, {{we present a}} wearable <b>repeater</b> <b>relay</b> system that overcomes the impairments of the in-to-out body propagation channel and reliably relays implant data to a remote access point. The system consists {{of a set of}} wearable textile repeater nodes, exploiting receive diversity to provide a sufficiently large instantaneous carrier-to-noise ratio for live video streaming. Each wearable node, combining a dedicated receive antenna capturing the implant signal, an amplifier and an off-body transmit antenna, is fully implemented in textile materials, such that the comfort of the patient is not disturbed by the relay system. After outlining the design steps for the wearable relay node, in particular demonstrating stable robust antenna characteristics for the textile receive antenna oriented towards the body, we experimentally verify that a 6 th-order diversity system provides the best compromise between user comfort and signal quality...|$|E

The proposed architecture uses multiple <b>repeaters</b> to <b>relay</b> signals from access routers to vehicles and vice versa.

The original packet is reconstructed in the vehicle station by consolidating the detected fragments. We call this approach information raining and show how {{it can be used to}} provide high throughput to highly mobile users. We show that the proposed system does not need handoff.

40|$|We {{propose a}} scheme for {{performing}} an entanglement-swapping operation within a quantum communications hub (a Bell like measurement) using an NV centre's |± 1 〉 | A_ 2 〉 optical transition. This {{is based on}} the heralded absorption of a photon resonant with that transition. The quantum efficiency of a single photon absorption is low but can be improved by placing the NV center inside a micro cavity to boost the interaction time and further by recycling the leaked photon back into the cavity after flipping its phase and/or polarisation. Throughout this process, the NV is repeatedly monitored via a QND measurement that heralds whether or not the photon absorption has succeeded. Upon success we know a destructive Bell measurement has occurred between that photon and NV center. Given low losses and a high per-pass absorption probability, this scheme allows the total success probability to approach unity. With long electron spin coherence times possible at low temperatures, this component could be useful within a memory-based quantum <b>repeater</b> or <b>relay.</b> Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures, 2 table...|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} of audio communication technology {{in form of}} the telephone, first patented in 1876, created the need to increase the amplitude of electrical signals to extend the transmission of signals over increasingly long distances. In telegraphy, this problem had been solved with intermediate devices at stations that replenished the dissipated energy by operating a signal recorder and transmitter back-to-back, forming a relay, so that a local energy source at each intermediate station powered the next leg of transmission.For duplex transmission, i.e. sending and receiving in both directions, bi-directional <b>relay</b> <b>repeaters</b> were developed starting {{with the work of}} C.

40|$|Conventionally, a memoryless analog <b>repeater</b> at the <b>relay</b> of a {{multihop}} transmission system amplifies the signal received from its incoming link, and retransmits the amplified signal to its outgoing link. In the frequency domain, such an amplification essentially {{is an ideal}} bandpass filtering, treating all the frequency components uniformly. For multicarrier systems like orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) over frequency-selective channels, such a frequency-flat amplification is inadequate to exploit the benefits of adaptive processing at the relay. This paper analyzes the potential performance gain of non-uniform frequency-domain relay amplification, in which the gain coefficients for subcarriers are adapted from the frequency responses of both the incoming and outgoing links. The end-to-end achievable rate optimization problem is formulated and shown to lack the desired concavity property and thus is not amenable to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker approaches like water-filling. A heuristic power allocation and relay processing algorithm is proposed, which adaptively selects and matches {{a subset of the}} subcarriers for each link, according to the realization of the link frequency responses. Numerical results show that the heuristic algorithm achieves considerable performance gains, compared to conventional amplify-and-forward relay processing without adaptive power allocation...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{compared}} {{the performance of a}} cellular OFDMA-TDD system enhanced with a MultiHop <b>relay</b> or optical <b>repeater.</b> In particular, we investigated bandwidth efficiency gained by a frequency reuse feature of a MultiHop relay along with outage performance subject to the co-channel interference under different resource allocation scenarios. In general, system throughput of the conventional IEEE 802.16 e mobile wireless broadband system can be significantly enhanced by either a MultiHop <b>relay</b> or <b>repeaters.</b> Furthermore, outage performance can be improved by <b>repeaters</b> or MultiHop <b>relays</b> with orthogonal allocation, since they improve C/I either by combining gain or by reducing the co-channel interference in the same cell, respectively. MultiHop relays will increase system capacity (almost doubling system throughput with the overlapped allocation), especially improving a per-user data rate in the cell edges or heavily shadowed areas. As these relays eliminate the need for a wire line relay, they facilitate rapid deployment and warrant economic feasibility. However, in the MultiHop relay system of overlapped allocation, there must be some means of circumventing the additional outage events around the subcell edges of the relay stations incurred by fully reusing the frequency in every relay station. One particular approach is a cooperative relay scheme that allows transmitting duplicate signals via multiple relay stations and then, combining them constructively in the receiver [15].|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Information Technology)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 2000 Sentech is {{the common}} carrier signal {{distributor}} in South Africa for Television and Radio programs. This radio telephone system {{is used by the}} company as a communications link for voice and data between remote transmitter sites and the Transmitter Control Centre. The system was installed in 1986 and consists of a mixture of fixed bases and mobile units. The location of these transmitting sites is mainly on top of mountains in remote, sparsely populated areas. The use of cellular telephones for communication is impossible, as 80 % of the sites fall outside the coverage area of the cells. Telkom infrastructure in these areas is most of the time not available or consists of shared farm lines. Only in the big metropolitan centres can data lines be considered at the main sites. It is not cost effective to consider it for the small sites. When the new system was installed, it replaced a single <b>repeater</b> system that <b>relayed</b> VHF radio signals from as far as 200 Km. The new system was a major improvement over the old system. Within a year it became apparent that it did not fulfill in all the needs of the company. A telephone-patch and two-tone cell call was added to increase the functionality. Data transfer and call-out systems were added to implement the new telemetry system to the sites.

40|$|In hostile environments {{such as in}} {{scientific}} facilities where ionising radiation is a dominant hazard, reducing human interventions by increasing robotic operations are desirable. CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, has around 50 km of underground scientific facilities, where wireless mobile robots could help {{in the operation of}} the accelerator complex, e. g. in conducting remote inspections and radiation surveys in different areas. The main challenges to be considered here are not only that the robots should be able to go over long distances and operate for relatively long periods, but also the underground tunnel environment, the possible presence of electromagnetic fields, radiation effects, {{and the fact that the}} robots shall in no way interrupt the operation of the accelerators. Having a reliable and robust wireless communication system is essential for successful execution of such robotic missions and to avoid situations of manual recovery of the robots in the event that the robot runs out of energy or when the robot loses its communication link. The goal of this thesis is to provide means to reduce risk of mission failure and maximise mission capabilities of wireless mobile robots with finite energy storage capacity working in a radiation environment with non-line-of-sight (NLOS) communications by employing enhanced wireless communication methods. Towards this goal, the following research objectives are addressed in this thesis: predict the communication range before and during robotic missions; optimise and enhance wireless communication qualities of mobile robots by using robot mobility and employing multi-robot network. This thesis provides introductory information on the infrastructures where mobile robots will need to operate, the tasks to be carried out by mobile robots and the problems encountered in these environments. The reporting of research work carried out to improve wireless communication comprises an introduction to the relevant radio signal propagation theory and technology followed by explanation of the research in the following stages: An analysis of the wireless communication requirements for mobile robot for different tasks in a selection of CERN facilities; predictions of energy and communication autonomies (in terms of distance and time) to reduce risk of energy and communication related failures during missions; autonomous navigation of a mobile robot to find zone(s) of maximum radio signal strength to improve communication coverage area; and autonomous navigation of one or more mobile robots acting as mobile wireless <b>relay</b> (<b>repeater)</b> points in order to provide a tethered wireless connection to a teleoperated mobile robot carrying out inspection or radiation monitoring activities in a challenging radio environment. The specific contributions of this thesis are outlined below. The first sets of contributions are novel methods for predicting the energy autonomy and communication range(s) before and after deployment of the mobile robots in the intended environments. This is important in order to provide situational awareness and avoid mission failures. The energy consumption is predicted by using power consumption models of different components in a mobile robot. This energy prediction model will pave the way for choosing energy-efficient wireless communication strategies. The communication range prediction is performed using radio signal propagation models and applies radio signal strength (RSS) filtering and estimation techniques with the help of Kalman filters and Gaussian process models. The second set of contributions are methods to optimise the wireless communication qualities by using novel spatial sampling based techniques that are robust to sensing and radio field noises and provide redundancy features. Central finite difference (CFD) methods are employed to determine the 2 -D RSS gradients and use robot mobility to optimise the communication quality and the network throughput. This method is also validated with a case study application involving superior haptic teleoperation of wireless mobile robots where an operator from a remote location can smoothly navigate a mobile robot in an environment with low-wireless signals. The third contribution is a robust stochastic position optimisation algorithm for multiple autonomous relay robots which are used for wireless tethering of radio signals and thereby to enhance the wireless communication qualities. All the proposed methods and algorithms are verified and validated using simulations and field experiments with a variety of mobile robots available at CERN. In summary, this thesis offers novel methods and demonstrates their use to predict energy autonomy and wireless communication range, optimise robots position to improve communication quality and enhance communication range and wireless network qualities of mobile robots for use in applications in hostile environmental characteristics such as scientific facilities emitting ionising radiations. In simpler terms, a set of tools are developed in this thesis for improving, easing and making safer robotic missions in hostile environments. This thesis validates both in theory and experiments that mobile robots can improve wireless communication quality by exploiting robots mobility to dynamically optimise their positions and maintain connectivity even when the (radio signal) environment possess non-line-of-sight characteristics. The methods developed in this thesis are well-suited for easier integration in mobile robots and can be applied directly at the application layer of the wireless network. The results of the proposed methods have outperformed other comparable state-of-the-art methods...|$|R
