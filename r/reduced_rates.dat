5|$|Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet! (released internationally as They Say I'm a Monkey!) is a 2008 Indonesian film {{directed}} by Djenar Maesa Ayu. Starring Titi Rajo Bintang, Henidar Amroe, and Ray Sahetapi, {{it tells the}} life story of Adjeng, who was sexually abused as a child by her mother's boyfriend. Filmed over 18days {{after several years of}} development, the film adapted two of Ayu's short stories from her debut anthology of the same name. Owing to its low budget of Rp620 million, its cast and crew were mostly amateurs and students, although several established actors appeared at <b>reduced</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|E

50|$|Before 1986 {{and from}} 2004 onward, {{individuals}} {{have been subject}} to a <b>reduced</b> <b>rate</b> of federal tax on capital gains (called long-term capital gains) on certain property held more than 12 months. This <b>reduced</b> <b>rate</b> (15% or 20%, depending on regular tax bracket) applies for regular tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. The <b>reduced</b> <b>rate</b> also applies to dividends from corporations organized in the United States or a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty.|$|R

25|$|When {{atherosclerosis}} {{has become}} severe and caused irreversible ischemia, such as tissue {{loss in the}} case of peripheral artery disease, surgery may be indicated. Vascular bypass surgery can re-establish flow around the diseased segment of artery, and angioplasty with or without stenting can reopen narrowed arteries and improve bloodflow. Coronary artery bypass grafting without manipulation of the ascending aorta has demonstrated <b>reduced</b> <b>rates</b> of postoperative stroke and mortality compared to traditional on-pump coronary revascularization.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to oral administration, parenteral progesterone, such as with vaginal administration, avoids the first-pass effect, {{and is not}} associated with supraphysiological concentrations of neurosteroid metabolites, nor with spikes or marked fluctuations in neurosteroid levels. Parenteral routes can be used instead of oral administration to avoid neurosteroid-related adverse effects if they prove to be problematic. Lower doses of oral progesterone are also associated with relatively <b>reduced</b> <b>rates</b> of conversion into neurosteroid metabolites and may similarly help to alleviate such side effects.|$|E

25|$|The STM {{does not}} keep {{separate}} accounts for Metro and buses services. The following figures therefore include both activities. In 2016, direct operating revenue planned by the STM totalled $667 million. To {{compensate for the}} <b>reduced</b> <b>rates,</b> the city will pay $513 million plus $351 million from Quebec. For a budget of $1.53 billion, salaries account for 57% of expenditures, followed in importance by financial expenses (22%) resulting from a 2.85 billion debt. For the Metro only, wages represented 75% of the $292 million operating costs, before electricity costs (9%).|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{also offers}} gym and sports classes called Hochschulsport. Since Tübingen has {{a department of}} sports science with {{a broad range of}} facilities, students of other subjects have the possibility to participate in various kinds of sports courses in teams or as individuals. Furthermore, even exotic sports, such as parachuting or martial arts, are offered. Students may attend courses either for free or at <b>reduced</b> <b>rates.</b> The sports department is located close to the Wilhelmstraße area of university buildings and is served by a number of frequent bus routes.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide, {{cervical}} cancer {{is both the}} fourth-most common cause of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. In 2012, an estimated 528,000 cases of {{cervical cancer}} occurred, with 266,000 deaths. This is about 8% of the total cases and total deaths from cancer. About 70% of cervical cancers occur in developing countries. In low-income countries, {{it is the most}} common cause of cancer death. In developed countries, the widespread use of cervical screening programs has dramatically <b>reduced</b> <b>rates</b> of cervical cancer. In medical research, the most famous cell line known as HeLa was developed from cervical cancer cells of a woman named Henrietta Lacks.|$|E

25|$|The 1971 war saw {{the release}} of two special aerogrammes. The first one {{released}} for general use depicted a hand behind a barbwire to symbolise the POWs being held in India. The second one was released with <b>reduced</b> <b>rates</b> {{to be used for}} sending mail to the POWs. In 1982, two special aerogrammes were released. They were overprints in gold on the Rs. 2 ones, and issued to commemorate the International Stamp Exhibition, Philexfrance and Intentional Stamp Fair, Riccione, Italy. In 1990, to commemorate the golden jubilee of the Pakistan Resolution passed in Lahore (1940), the Post Office used a special aerogramme depicting Quaid-e-Azam, Mohammad Ali Jinnah.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{principal}} achievements of UNCTAD (1964) has been to conceive and implement the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). It was argued in UNCTAD that to promote exports of manufactured goods from developing countries, {{it would be necessary}} to offer special tariff concessions to such exports. Accepting this argument, the developed countries formulated the GSP scheme under which manufacturers' exports and some agricultural goods from the developing countries enter duty-free or at <b>reduced</b> <b>rates</b> in the developed countries. Since imports of such items from other developed countries are subject to the normal rates of duties, imports of the same items from developing countries would enjoy a competitive advantage.|$|E
25|$|Bulk mail is {{mail that}} is {{prepared}} for bulk mailing, often by presorting, and processing at <b>reduced</b> <b>rates.</b> It is often used in direct marketing and other advertising mail, although it has other uses as well. The senders of these messages sometimes purchase lists of addresses (which are sometimes targeted towards certain demographics) and then send letters advertising their product or service to all recipients. Other times, commercial solicitations are sent by local companies advertising local products, like a restaurant delivery service advertising to their delivery area or a retail store sending their weekly advertising circular to a general area. Bulk mail is also often sent to companies' existing subscriber bases, advertising new products or services.|$|E
40|$|My Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the tax {{incidence}} {{in the context of}} the increase of <b>reduced</b> <b>rate</b> of VAT (value added tax) in the Czech republic.

The impact of the tax is quantified on the basis of the changes in the consumption prices of water in 2011 and in 2012...|$|R
40|$|The {{value-added}} tax makes a significant {{part of our}} tax system and is a key revenue of the state budget. The VAT is paid to state since January 1, 1993, when it replaced the sales tax. The taxpayer is anyone who buys certain product or service. Since 2015 the basic rate of VAT is 21 %, the <b>reduced</b> <b>rate</b> is 15 %. A novelty in 2015 in the Czech republic has become a reduction of the <b>reduced</b> <b>rate</b> to 10 % for some products, for example baby food, medicaments, books and more. As the payer and the taxpayer of VAT {{are not the same}} subjects, we classify this tax together with excise duties among indirect taxes. The other part of our tax system form direct taxes, which are devided into income and property taxes. The statistical calculations show that an increase of the basic <b>rate</b> of VAT <b>reduces</b> state budget revenues, therefore there is an inverse relationship. Conversely, an increase of the <b>reduced</b> <b>rate</b> of VAT will increase state budget revenues, since the <b>reduced</b> <b>rate</b> applies to goods necessary for survival...|$|R
25|$|Smoking bans are {{generally}} acknowledged to <b>reduce</b> <b>rates</b> of smoking; smoke-free workplaces <b>reduce</b> smoking <b>rates</b> among workers, and restrictions upon smoking {{in public places}} <b>reduce</b> general smoking <b>rates</b> {{through a combination of}} stigmatisation and reduction in the social cues for smoking. However, reports in the popular press after smoking bans have been enacted often present conflicting accounts as regards perceptions of effectiveness.|$|R
25|$|Copyrights {{could be}} inherited. The rights of heirs and other legal successors were restored: they were {{entitled}} to receive the full royalties on a work. The <b>reduced</b> <b>rates</b> for heirs of at most 50% of the standard schedule were abandoned, but increased taxation of royalties received by heirs offset this benefit again. If no heirs existed, or the author had disinherited them or had willed his works to the state, copyright ceased with the author's death (this had already been the case under the 1961/1964 laws). Parallel to the new laws, the republics also issued new royalty schedules, generally with decreasing remuneration scales: an author was, for instance, entitled to more money on the first print run than on subsequent runs.|$|E
25|$|The generations who led {{and fought}} the American Civil War were born into an {{independent}} United States {{and they would}} determine whether it could continue as a united republic. Steam power on land and sea had begun to shrink {{the world and the}} telegraph moved information at the speed of electricity. In 1851, Congress <b>reduced</b> <b>rates</b> for typical uses such as printed matter to one cent, and three-cent letter postage versus five or ten-cent rates. Postal distances for each rate were extended as much as ten times, for example, from three hundred to 3,000 miles. Their world was filled with mechanized innovations that included the first U.S. postage stamps produced from machine perforation to replace the cutting tasks which had been done manually. These were accompanied by innovations in paper types and printing techniques.|$|E
25|$|The most {{effective}} method for preventing CDI is proper antimicrobial prescribing. In the hospital setting, where CDI is most common, nearly all patients who develop CDI {{are exposed to}} antimicrobials. Although proper antimicrobial prescribing is highly recommended, about 50% of antimicrobial use is considered inappropriate. This is consistent whether in the hospital, clinic, community, or academic setting. A decrease in CDI by limiting antibiotics or by limiting unnecessary antimicrobial prescriptions in general, both in an outbreak and non-outbreak setting has been demonstrated to be most strongly associated with reduced CDI. Further, reactions to medication may be severe: CDI infections were the most common contributor to adverse drug events seen in U.S. hospitals in 2011. In some regions of the UK, reduced used of fluoroquinolone antibiotics seems to lead to <b>reduced</b> <b>rates</b> of CDI.|$|E
