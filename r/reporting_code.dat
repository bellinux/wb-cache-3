5000|$|Naval variant {{based on}} MiG-29M, the letter [...] "K" [...] stands for [...] "Korabelnogo bazirovaniya" [...] (deck-based). It {{features}} folding wings, arrestor gear, and reinforced landing gear. Originally {{intended for the}} Admiral Kuznetsov class aircraft carriers, it had received series production approval from the Russian Ministry of Defence but was grounded in 1992 due to shift in military doctrine and financial difficulties. The MiG Corporation restarted the program in 1999. On 20 January 2004, the Indian Navy signed a contract of 12 single-seat MiG-29K and four two-seat MiG-29KUB. Modifications were made for the Indian Navy requirement. Production MiG-29K and MiG-29KUB share a two-seater size canopy. The MiG-29K has radar absorbing coatings to reduce radar signature. Cockpit displays consist of wide HUD and three (seven on MiG-29KUB) colour LCD MFDs with a Topsight E helmet-mounted targeting system.

5000|$|The MiG-29S, {{given the}} NATO <b>reporting</b> <b>code</b> [...] "Fulcrum-C", {{features}} {{flight control system}} improvements; {{a total of four}} new computers provide better stability augmentation and controllability with an increase of 2° in angle of attack (AoA). An improved mechanical-hydraulic flight control system allows for greater control surface deflections. The MiG-29S has a dorsal hump, which led to its nickname [...] "Fatback", houses the L-203BE Gardenyia-1 ECM system. The MiG-29S can carry 1,150 liter (304 US gallon, 2,000 lb) under wing drop tanks and a centerline tank. The inboard underwing hardpoints allow a tandem pylon arrangement for carrying a larger payload of 4,000 kg (8,820 lb). Overall maximum gross weight has been raised to 20,000 kg (44,000 lb). Built only for domestic use. Early MiG-29S featured an IRST sighting system; the MiG-29S improvement kit includes the Phazotron N019M radar and Built-In Test Equipment (BITE) to reduce dependence on ground support equipment; MiG MAPO designates this as MiG-29SD. Improvements to software and processing capabilities enables the tracking of up to 10 targets and the simultaneous engagement of two with the R-77 missile. The MiG-29S also has a limited ground-attack capability.|$|E

40|$|A {{new code}} {{structure}} with zero in-phase cross correlation for spectral amplitude coding optical code {{division multiple access}} (SAC-OCDMA) system is proposed, and called zero vectors combinatorial (ZVC). This code is constructed in a simple algebraic way using Euclidean vectors and combinatorial theories based on the relationship between the number of users N and the weight W. One of the important properties of this code is that the maximum cross correlation (CC) is always zero, which means that multi-user interference (MUI) and phase induced intensity noise (PIIN) are reduced. Bit error rate (BER) performance is compared with previous <b>reported</b> <b>codes.</b> Therefore, theoretically, we demonstrate the performance of ZVC code with the related equations. In addition, the structure of the encoder/decoder based on fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) and the proposed system have been analyzed theoretically by taking into consideration the effects of some noises. The results characterizing BER with respect to the total number of active users show that ZVC code offers a significantly improved performance over previous <b>reported</b> <b>codes</b> by supporting large numbers of users at BER≥ 10 - 9. A comprehensive simulation study has been carried out using a commercial optical system simulator “VPI™”. Moreover, it was shown that the proposed code managed to reduce the hardware complexity and eventually the cost...|$|R
