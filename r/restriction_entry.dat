In the political equilibrium, where the regulator values the welfare of each group, {{only one of these}} constraints is binding. If the zero profit constraint for the marginal fisherman is binding, then the regulator prefers policies that increase effort. A necessary and sufficient condition for this result to occur is that the regulator places extraordinary weight on the welfare of input suppliers relative to fishing captains. If the regulator places less than equal weight on the welfare of input suppliers relative to fishing captains, the season length is pushed towards its maximum. # I have benefited from comments from Chris Batstone, Diane Bischak, Daniel Gordon, John Hillas, Ken Jackson, Basil Sharp, Quinn Weninger, Jim Wilen, seminar participants at the University of Auckland and the University of Calgary, three referees, the Associate Editor, and the Editor.

40|$|We {{study how}} <b>restrictions</b> on firm <b>entry</b> affect intersectoral factor {{reallocation}} when open economies experience global economic shocks. In our theoretical framework, countries trade freely {{in a range}} of differentiated sectors that are subject to country-specific and global shocks. <b>Entry</b> <b>restrictions</b> are modeled as an upper bound on the introduction of new differentiated goods following shocks. Prices and quantities adjust to clear international goods markets, and wages adjust to clear national labor markets. We show that in general equilibrium, countries with tighter <b>entry</b> <b>restrictions</b> see less factor reallocation compared to the frictionless benchmark. In our empirical work, we compare sectoral employment reallocation across countries in the 1980 s and 1990 s with proxies for frictionless benchmark reallocation. Our results indicate that the gap between actual and frictionless reallocation is greater in countries where it takes longer to start a firm...|$|R
