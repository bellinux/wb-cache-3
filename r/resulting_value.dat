5|$|At the {{suggestion}} of C. J. Gorter, the team attempted to use an oscillating field. This {{became the basis for}} the nuclear magnetic resonance method. In 1937, Rabi, Kusch, Millman and Zacharias used it to measure the magnetic moment of several lithium compounds with molecular beams, including lithium chloride, lithium fluoride and dilithium. Applying the method to hydrogen, they found that the moment of a proton was 2.785±0.02 nuclear magnetons, and not 1 as predicted by the then-current theory, while that of a deuteron was 0.855±0.006 nuclear magnetons. This provided more accurate measurements of what Stern's team had found, and Rabi's team had confirmed, in 1934. Since a deuteron is composed of a proton and a neutron with aligned spins, the neutron's magnetic moment could be inferred by subtracting the proton's magnetic moment from the deuteron's. The <b>resulting</b> <b>value</b> was not zero, and had a sign opposite to that of the proton. Based on curious artifacts of these more accurate measurements, Rabi suggested that the deuteron had an electric quadrupole moment. This discovery meant that the physical shape of the deuteron was not symmetric, which provided valuable insight into the nature of the nuclear force binding nucleons. For the creation of the molecular-beam magnetic-resonance detection method, Rabi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944.|$|E
25|$|The base is {{physically}} located between the emitter and the collector and {{is made from}} lightly doped, high-resistivity material. The collector surrounds the emitter region, making it almost impossible for the electrons injected into the base region to escape without being collected, thus making the <b>resulting</b> <b>value</b> of α very close to unity, and so, giving the transistor a large β. A cross-section view of a BJT indicates that the collector–base junction has a much larger area than the emitter–base junction.|$|E
25|$|Another, easier {{equation}} {{that can}} be applied to get the correct molecular formula of the CFC/R/Freon class compounds is this to take the numbering and add 90 to it. The <b>resulting</b> <b>value</b> will give the number of carbons as the first numeral, the second numeral gives the number of hydrogen atoms, and the third numeral gives the number of fluorine atoms. The rest of the unaccounted carbon bonds are occupied by chlorine atoms. The value of this equation is always a three figure number. An easy example is that of CFC-12, which gives: 90+12=102 -> 1 carbon, 0 hydrogens, 2 fluorine atoms, and hence 2 chlorine atoms resulting in CCl2F2. The main advantage of this method of deducing the molecular composition in comparison with the method described in the paragraph above is that it gives the number of carbon atoms of the molecule.|$|E

The <b>results</b> <b>values</b> are module ID, the creation {{time of the}} <b>results</b> <b>value,</b> module name, module version, and checked flag.

25|$|Assignment statements, in {{imperative}} paradigm, {{perform an}} operation on information located in memory and store {{the results in}} memory for later use. High-level imperative languages, in addition, permit the evaluation of complex expressions, which may consist {{of a combination of}} arithmetic operations and function evaluations, and the assignment of the <b>resulting</b> <b>value</b> to memory. Looping statements (as in while loops, do while loops, and for loops) allow a sequence of statements to be executed multiple times. Loops can either execute the statements they contain a predefined number of times, or they can execute them repeatedly until some condition changes. Conditional branching statements allow a sequence of statements to be executed only if some condition is met. Otherwise, the statements are skipped and the execution sequence continues from the statement following them. Unconditional branching statements allow an execution sequence to be transferred to another part of a program. These include the jump (called goto in many languages), switch, and the subprogram, subroutine, or procedure call (which usually returns to the next statement after the call).|$|E
500|$|The {{measured}} values for these particles were only in rough {{agreement between the}} groups, but the Rabi group confirmed the earlier Stern measurements that the magnetic moment for the proton was unexpectedly large. [...] Since a deuteron is composed of a proton and a neutron with aligned spins, the neutron's magnetic moment could be inferred by subtracting the deuteron and proton magnetic moments. [...] The <b>resulting</b> <b>value</b> was not zero and had sign opposite {{to that of the}} proton. [...] Values for the magnetic moment of the neutron were also determined by R. Bacher at Ann Arbor (1933) and I.Y. Tamm and S.A. Altshuler in the Soviet Union (1934) from studies of the hyperfine structure of atomic spectra. [...] Although Tamm and Altshuler's estimate had the correct sign and order of magnitude (...) , the result was met with skepticism. [...] By the late 1930s, accurate values for the magnetic moment of the neutron had been deduced by the Rabi group using measurements employing newly developed nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. [...] The large value for the proton's magnetic moment and the inferred negative value for the neutron's magnetic moment were unexpected and could not be explained. [...] The anomalous values for the magnetic moments of the nucleons would remain a puzzle until the quark model was developed in the 1960s.|$|E
