40|$|Aim: To test if <b>reventilation</b> {{with room}} air (RA) or 100 % oxygen (O- 2) after {{asphyxia}} would differentially affect neuronal damage in different brain areas of newborn pigs. Methods: Anaesthetized piglets {{were subjected to}} 10 min asphyxia (n = 27) or served as time controls (n = 7). <b>Reventilation</b> started with either RA or O- 2 for 1 h, and was continued with RA for an additional 1 - 3 h. Cortical or cerebellar blood flow was assessed with laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Haematoxylin/eosin-stained sections from six brain regions were prepared for blinded neuropathological examination and scoring. Results: Asphyxia resulted in significant neuronal damage compared to time controls in all areas examined except the pons. O 2 ventilation elicited greater neuronal lesions in the hippocampus and the cerebellum but smaller damage in the basal ganglia compared to RA. The assessed physiological parameters including the LDF signals were similar in both ventilation groups, except for PaO 2 in the first hour of <b>reventilation</b> (RA 75 +/- 5 mmHg, O- 2 348 +/- 57 mmHg; p < 0. 05). Interestingly, however, reactive hyperaemia was much higher in the O- 2 -sensitive cerebellum {{as compared with the}} cortex (1101 +/- 227 vs 571 +/- 73; p < 0. 05, area under the curve). Conclusion: O- 2 toxicity after asphyxia was demonstrated in the piglet hippocampus and cerebellum but not in the cerebral cortex or basal ganglia.

40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} if a weaning regimen on flow driver continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) would decrease the number of ventilator days but {{increase the number of}} CPAP days when compared with a rescue regimen.  METHODS—Fifty eight babies of 24 - 32 weeks gestation with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) were studied prospectively. After extubation they were randomly allocated to receive CPAP for 72 hours (n= 29) according to a weaning regimen, or were placed in headbox oxygen and received CPAP only if preset "start CPAP" criteria were met (n= 29, rescue group).  RESULTS—There was no difference in successful extubation at 72 hours, 1 and 2 weeks, between the groups {{in terms of the number}} of <b>reventilation</b> episodes, <b>reventilation</b> days, or in total days of CPAP. Birthweight, gestational age, race, day of first extubation, antenatal or postnatal steroids, patent ductus arteriosus status and maximal mean airway pressure used were of no value in predicting success or failure at 72 hours, 1, or 2 weeks.  CONCLUSION—The weaning regimen did not decrease the number of ventilator days or days on CPAP compared with the rescue regimen. The rescue regimen on flow driver CPAP seems to be a safe and effective method of managing a baby of 24 - 32 weeks gestation who has been ventilated for RDS or immature lung disease. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The maximum {{relaxation}} rate (MRR; percentage fall in pressure/ 10 ms) of oesophageal (POES) and transdiaphragmatic (PDI) pressure slows {{under conditions}} of loaded breathing, and has been measured previously in normal subjects. MRR has not been measured in intubated patients weaning from mechanical ventilation. METHODS [...] Five postoperative patients who were expected to wean and nine patients who had previously failed were studied. POES and PDI MRR, peak oesophageal pressure during spontaneous breathing, maximum oesophageal pressure, and the inspiratory duty cycle were measured at rest during mechanical ventilation, {{in the first two}} minutes of spontaneous breathing, and after <b>reventilation</b> in those patients who failed, or before extubation in those patients who succeeded. RESULTS [...] At rest POES MRR in intubated patients had a range of 5. 6 - 11 and PDI MRR 6. 9 - 10. 0, with a coefficient of variation of 9. 9 % and 7. 3 % respectively. POES and PDI MRR were similar before and after extubation in five postoperative patients, and POES MRR was reflected by endotracheal MRR measured at the airway. In five patients who failed to wean POES and PDI MRR slowed by 47 % and 44 %, and fully recovered after 10 minutes <b>reventilation.</b> In four patients who were successfully weaned MRR was unchanged during spontaneous breathing. At the time when MRR decreased, the respiratory muscles were heavily loaded in relation to their strength. CONCLUSIONS [...] Weaning failure occurs when the applied load exceeds the capacity of the respiratory muscles, and this is associated with a slowing of respiratory muscle MRR...|$|E

The empyreal part of the reservoir was covered with Saran Wrap®, and the liquid surface of the reservoir was separated from the air. The pulmonary arterial and left atrial cannula were both opened to the atmosphere, resulting in an intravascular pressure of 0  mmHg during ischemia. The isolated lungs were reperfused and reventilated for 60  min after ischemia. The flow velocity at the start of reperfusion was increased slowly to 30  ml/kg/min, so that the PPA did not exceed 20  mmHg. At the start of <b>reventilation,</b> the positive end-expiratory pressure was established as 10  cmH 2 O for a few respirations until atelectasis was macroscopically relieved, but the same respiratory conditions as adopted in the equilibration period were used thereafter. In the desflurane-treated ischemia–reperfusion (DES-IR) group (n =  6), 1 MAC [1 MAC =  8.9 % for rabbits (Loer et al. 1995)] desflurane was administered for 30  min during the equilibration period, then ischemia was performed for 75  min, followed by 60  min reperfusion and <b>reventilation,</b> which was the same as that for the IR group.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{studied the}} effects of an episode of induced apnoea on the dynamic {{compliance}} (Crs) and resistance (Rrs) of the respiratory system in anaesthetized lambs and investigated the mechanisms underlying {{the effectiveness of a}} timed reexpansion inspiratory manoeuvre (TRIM). METHODS: Following 2 min of apnoea, three manoeuvres were randomly performed: (i) control: reventilated without TRIM using initial settings and gas composition of 30 % oxygen in 70 % nitrous oxide; (b) T 1 : TRIM with 30 % oxygen in 70 % nitrous oxide, followed by <b>reventilation</b> with the initial settings; and (c) T 2 : preoxygenate with 100 % oxygen, apnoea, then TRIM with 100 % oxygen, then <b>reventilation</b> with 100 % oxygen at the initial settings. The percentage change in Crs and Rrs was calculated at first breath, second breath, 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, 120 and 180 s postapnoea. RESULTS: Mean control decreased 15 % and did not return to baseline during the study period. TRIM increased mean Crs in T 1 and T 2 by 8 % and 9 %, respectively, at first breath and returned to baseline and did not deteriorate {{for the remainder of the}} study period. Mean Rrs in the control group increased 20 % and did not return to baseline during the study period. Mean Rrs in T 1 and T 2 initially increased 17 % and 27 %, respectively, at first breath and returned to baseline within 40 s. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that significant deterioration occurs in Crs and Rrs following 2 min of apnoea in anaesthetized lambs, which is not corrected with normal ventilation but is rapidly and completely reversed with a TRIM. This supports our hypothesis that volume recruitment of alveoli is an effective manoeuvre in restoring lung function. The practice of preoxygenation is also reinforced as the lambs maintained maximal oxygen saturation if they were ventilated with 100 % oxygen prior to the 2 min of apnoea...|$|E

40|$|Forty preterm infants {{suffering}} from respiratory distress syndrome {{were entered into}} a randomised controlled trial to assess {{the importance of the}} length of inspiratory time during weaning from high frequency positive pressure ventilation (HFPPV). Two weaning regimes were compared: in one (group A) inspiratory time was limited to 0. 5 seconds throughout weaning, in the other (group B) ventilator rate was reduced by increasing both inspiratory and expiratory time (inspiration:expiration ratio constant) until inspiratory time reached 1. 0 seconds. At ventilator rates of 20 and 40 breaths/minute an acute comparison was made in all 40 infants of the two inspiratory times; despite the lower mean airway pressure associated with the shorter inspiratory time blood gases were maintained. There was no difference in the incidence of pneumothoraces or need for <b>reventilation</b> between the two regimens but infants in group A had a shorter duration of weaning. We conclude limitation of inspiratory time to 0. 5 seconds during weaning from HFPPV is advantageous to preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Background: Silent sinus {{syndrome}} is characterised by spontaneous enophthalmos and hypoglobus, {{in association with}} chronic atelectasis of the maxillary sinus, {{and in the absence}} of signs or symptoms of intrinsic sinonasal inflammatory disease. Traditionally, correction of the enophthalmos involved reconstruction of the orbital floor, which was performed simultaneously with sinus surgery. Recently, there has been increasing evidence to support the performance of uncinectomy and antrostomy alone, then orbital floor reconstruction as a secondstage procedure if needed. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 23 cases of chronic maxillary atelectasis managed in our unit with endoscopic uncinectomy and antrostomy alone. All patients were operated upon by the same surgeon. Results: Twenty-two of the 23 patients had either complete or partial resolution. One patient had ongoing enophthalmos, and was considered for an orbital floor reconstruction as a second-stage procedure. Conclusion: Our case series demonstrates that dynamic changes in orbital floor position can occur after sinus <b>reventilation.</b> These findings support the approach of delaying orbital floor reconstruction in cases of silent sinus syndrome treated with sinus re-ventilation, as such reconstruction may prove unnecessary over time. 5 page(s...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Patients {{requiring}} {{mechanical ventilation}} for prolonged periods typically are sicker and have more comorbid illnesses than do patients who can be weaned more rapidly. As a result, the weaning process is often complex, requiring shared decision making by a skilled, multidisciplinary team. Unfortunately, many of the structures used in critical care units to plan and evaluate care do not lend themselves to collaborative management of patients. • OBJECTIVE To evaluate {{the effect of a}} collaborative weaning plan on outcomes, including duration of mechanical ventilation, for patients treated with mechanical ventilation for 7 days or more. • METHODS A collaborative weaning plan (weaning board and flow sheet) was introduced into the medical intensive care unit at the University of California Los Angeles, Medical Center. A historical design was used to compare outcomes before and after the plan was used. The primary outcome variable was duration of mechanical ventilation. Other outcomes studied included length of stay in the unit, cost, prevalence of complications (ie, <b>reventilation,</b> readmission to the intensive care unit), and mortality rate. • RESULTS The collaborative weaning plan decreased duration of ventilation by 4. 9 days (P =. 02) and decreased median length of stay in the unit by 4. 5 days (P =. 004).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effects of asphyxia-reventilation and hyperoxia on the {{cerebral}} blood perfusion and prostanoid production of the brain arteries and microvessels in piglets. After 10 min of asphyxia, animals were ventilated with room air, or with 100 % O 2. Following 4 hours of recovery, the brains were perfused, cerebral arteries were removed and microvessels were isolated from the cortex. The microvessels and the arteries were incubated with 1 - 14 C-arachidonic acid, and the 1 - 14 C-prostanoids were then separated by means of overpressure thin-layer chromatography and were quantitatively determined. Under control conditions, the synthesis of dilatory prostanoids dominated the arachidonate cascade both in the microvessels and in the arteries. Asphyxia and <b>reventilation</b> with room air did not modify the prostanoid production. O 2 ventilation greatly affected the prostanoid synthesis of the microvessels, with an enhancement of PGD 2 up to 247 ± 27 %. In the arteries, the production of PGI 2 and of PGE 2 was elevated to 272 ± 15 % and to 148 ± 13 %, respectively. These findings indicate that O 2 ventilation after asphyxia substantially increases the extent of prostanoid synthesis in the cerebral blood vessels. ...|$|E

The study aimed to quantitatively determine COX- 2 immunopositive neurons in different brain regions in piglets under normoxic conditions (n= 15), and 4 hours after 10 min asphyxia (n= 11). Asphyxia did not induce significant changes in neuronal COX- 2 expression of any studied brain areas. In contrast, there was a marked regional difference in all experimental groups. Thus, significant difference was observed between fronto-parietal and temporo-occipital regions: 59 ± 4 % and 67 ± 3 % versus 41 ± 2 %* and 31 ± 3 %* respectively (mean±SEM, data are pooled from all subjects, n= 26, *p< 0. 05, vs. fronto-parietal region). In the hippocampus, COX- 2 immunopositivity was rare (highest expression in CA 1 region: 14 ± 2 %). The studied subcortical areas showed negligible COX- 2 staining.

40|$|Background: The {{neurovascular}} unit {{encompasses the}} functional interactions of cerebrovascular and brain parenchymal cells {{necessary for the}} metabolic homeostasis of neurons. Previous studies indicated marked but only transient (1 - 4 h) reactive oxygen species-dependent neurovascular dysfunction in newborn pigs after severe hypoxic/ischemic (H/I) stress contributing to the neuronal injury after birth asphyxia. Objectives: Our major purpose {{was to determine if}} neurovascular dysfunction would also occur later, at 24 h after a milder H/I stress. We also tested if the putative hydroxyl radical scavenger hydrogen (H 2) exerted neurovascular protection. Methods: Anesthetized, ventilated piglets were assigned to three groups of 9 animals: time control, asphyxia/reventilation with air, and asphyxia/reventilation with air + 2. 1 % H 2 for 4 h. Asphyxia was induced by suspending ventilation for 8 min. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CR) of pial arterioles was determined using closed cranial window/intravital microscopy 24 h after asphyxia to the endothelium-dependent cerebrovascular stimulus hypercapnia, the neuronal function-dependent stimulus N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), norepinephrine, and sodium nitroprusside. The brains were subjected to histopathology. Results: Hemodynamic parameters, blood gases, and core temperature did not differ significantly among the experimental groups. In the early <b>reventilation</b> period, the recovery of electroencephalographic activity was significantly better in H 2 -treated animals. Asphyxia/reventilation severely attenuated CR to hypercapnia and NMDA; however, reactivity to norepinephrine and sodium nitroprusside were unaltered. H 2 fully or partially preserved CR to hypercapnia or NMDA, respectively. Histopathology revealed modest neuroprotection afforded by H 2. Conclusions: Severe stimulus-selective delayed neurovascular dysfunction develops and persists even after mild H/I stress.

40|$|The {{present study}} uses a multiproxy {{approach}} {{in order to}} further understand the evolution of climate responses in the western Mediterranean as of the Last Glacial Maximum. Sediments from ODP Site 975 in the Algero-Balearic basin have been analysed at high resolution, both geochemically andmineralogicallly. The resulting data have been used as proxies to establish a sedimentary regime, primary marine productivity, the preservation of the proxies and oxygen conditions. Fluctuations in detrital element concentrations were mainly the consequence of wet/arid oscillations. Productivity has been established using Ba excess, according to which marine productivity appears to have been greatest during cold events Heinrich 1 and Younger Dryas. The S 1 time interval was not as marked by increases in productivity as was the eastern Mediterranean. In contrast, the S 1 interval was first characterized by a decreasing trend and then by a fall in productivity after the 8. 2 ky BP dry-cold event. Since then productivity has remained low. Here we report that there was an important redox event in this basin, probably a consequence of the major oceanographic circulation change occurring in the western Mediterranean at 7. 7 ky BP. This circulation change led to <b>reventilation</b> as well as to diagenetic remobilization of redox-sensitive elements and organic matter oxidation. Comparisons between our paleoceanographic reconstruction for this basin and those regarding other Mediterranean basins support the hypothesis that across the Mediterranean there were different types of responses to climate forcing mechanism.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of three dosing regimens of caffeine for preterm infants in the periextubation period. Methods: A randomized double-blind clinical trial of three dosing regimens of caffeine citrate (3, 15 and 30 mg/kg) for periextubation management of ventilated preterm infants was undertaken. Infants born 48 h were eligible for the study. Caffeine citrate was given as a once daily dose {{for a period of}} 6 days commencing 24 h prior to a planned extubation, or within 6 h of an unplanned extubation. The primary outcome measure was extubation failure, defined as neonates who were unable to be extubated within 48 h of caffeine loading or who required <b>reventilation</b> or doxapram dose within 7 days of caffeine loading. Continuous recordings of oxygen saturation and heart rate were undertaken in a subgroup of enrolled infants. Results: A total of 127 babies were enrolled into the study (42, 40, 45, in the 3, 15, and 30 mg/kg groups, respectively). No statistically significant difference was demonstrated in the incidence of extubation failure between dosing groups (19, 10, and 11 infants in the 3, 15, and 30 mg/kg groups, respectively), however, infants in the two higher dose groups had statistically significantly less documented apnoea than the lowest dose group. Of the 37 neonates with continuous pulse oximetry recordings, those on higher doses of caffeine recorded a statistically significantly higher mean heart rate, oxygen saturations and less time with oxygen saturations < 85 %. Conclusions: This trial indicated there were short-term benefits of decreased apnoea in the immediate periextubation period for ventilated infants born < 32 weeks gestation receiving higher doses of caffeine.

40|$|Hypoxic-ischemic {{encephalopathy}} (HIE) is {{the major}} consequence of perinatal asphyxia (PA) in term neonates. Although the newborn piglet is an accepted large animal PA/HIE model, {{there is no consensus}} on PA-induction methodology to produce clinically relevant HIE. We aimed to create and to characterize a novel PA model faithfully reproducing all features of asphyxiation including severe hypercapnia resulting in HIE, and to test whether H 2 is neuroprotective in this model. Piglets were anaesthetised, artificially ventilated, and intensively monitored (electroencephalography, core temperature, O 2 saturation, arterial blood pressure and blood gases). Asphyxia (20 min) was induced by ventilation with a hypoxic-hypercapnic (6 %O 2 - 20 %CO 2) gas mixture. Asphyxia-induced changes in the cortical microcirculation were assessed with laser-speckle contrast imaging and analysis. Asphyxia was followed by <b>reventilation</b> with air or air containing hydrogen (2. 1 %H 2, 4 hours). After 24 hours survival, the brains were harvested for neuropathology. Our PA model was characterized by the development of severe hypoxia (pO 2 = 27 +/- 4 mmHg), and combined acidosis (pH = 6. 76 +/- 0. 04; pCO 2 = 114 +/- 11 mmHg; lactate = 12. 12 +/- 0. 83 mmol/L), however, cortical ischemia did not develop during the stress. Severely depressed electroencephalography (EEG), and marked neuronal injury indicated the development of HIE. H 2 was neuroprotective shown both by the enhanced recovery of EEG and by the significant preservation of neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and the thalamus. H 2 appeared to reduce oxidative stress shown by attenuation of 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine immunostaining. In summary, this new PA piglet model is able to induce moderate/severe HIE, and the efficacy of hydrogen post-treatment to preserve neuronal activity/function in this PA/HIE model suggests the feasibility of this safe and inexpensive approach in the treatment of asphyxiated babies...|$|E
40|$|A {{multicomponent}} diagenetic {{model was}} developed and applied to reconstruct {{the conditions under which}} the most recent sapropel, S 1, was deposited in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Simulations demonstrate that bottom waters must have been anoxic and sulphidic during the formation of S 1 and that organic matter deposition was approximately three times higher than at present. Nevertheless, most present day sediment and pore water profiles — with the exception of pyrite, iron oxyhydroxides, iron-bound phosphorus and phosphate — can be reproduced under a wide range of redox conditions during formation of S 1 by varying the depositional flux of organic carbon. As a result, paleoredox indicators (e. g., C org:S ratio, C org:P org ratio, trace metals) are needed when assessing the contribution of oxygen-depletion and enhanced primary production to the formation of organic-rich layers in the geological record. Furthermore, simulations show that the organic carbon concentration in sediments is a direct proxy for export production under anoxic bottom waters. The model is also used to examine the post-depositional alteration of the organic-rich layer focussing on nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic carbon dynamics. After sapropel formation, remineralisation is dominated by aerobic respiration at a rate that is inversely proportional to the time since bottom waters became oxic once again. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to identify the most pertinent parameters in regulating the oxidation of sapropels, demonstrating that variations in sedimentation rate, depositional flux of organic carbon during sapropel formation, bottom water oxygen concentration, and porosity have the largest impact. Simulations reveal that sedimentary nutrient cycling was markedly different during the formation of S 1, as well as after reoxygenation of bottom waters. Accumulation of organic nitrogen in sediments doubled during sapropel deposition, representing a significant nitrogen sink. Following <b>reventilation</b> of deep waters, N 2 production by denitrification was almost 12 times greater than present day values. Phosphorus cycling also exhibits a strong redox sensitivity. The benthic efflux of phosphate was up to 3. 5 times higher during the formation of S 1 than at present due to elevated depositional fluxes of organic matter coupled with enhanced remineralisation of organic phosphorus. Reoxygenation of bottom waters leads to a large phosphate pulse to the water column that declines rapidly with time due to rapid oxidation of organic material. The oxidation of pyrite at the redox front forms iron oxyhydroxides that bind phosphorus and, thus, attenuate the benthic phosphate efflux. These results underscore the contrasting effects of oxygen-depletion on sedimentary nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. The simulations also confirm that the current conceptual paradigm of sapropel formation and oxidation is valid and quantitatively coherent...|$|E
40|$|Redox {{conditions}} and the mechanisms of redox development are a critical aspect of Eastern Mediterranean sapropels, whose formation in oxygen-depleted waters {{is closely related to}} water column stratification at times of global sea level rise and insolation maxima. Sapropels in the Nile Fan formed at relatively shallow water depths {{under the influence of the}} monsoon-driven freshwater output from the River Nile. This work evaluates the redox evolution of Holocene sapropel S 1 in VALPAMED cruise core MD 9509, recovered at 880 mbsl in the NE Nile Fan, using a combination of geochemical element proxies, Fe speciation, Fe and Mo isotopes studies. The productivity and redox proxies (Ba/Al, Mo/Al, U/Al, V/Al, Sb/Al) show well-defined enrichments in the sapropel, but with a marked minimum at ca 8. 2 ka indicative of <b>reventilation</b> corresponding to a well known global cooling event. Peak productivity and reducing signals occur close to the initiation of sapropel formation. The proxy signals in sapropel 9509 are stronger and of longer duration than those of a second sapropel S 1, recovered at the same depth, but 380 km to the north (MD 9501), supporting the notion (suggested in previous studies) of more reduced conditions in the Nile Fan. The MoEF vs. UEF enrichment factor variations in core 9509 infer a transition from open marine suboxic conditions in the enclosing non-sapropel sediments to anoxic non-sulphidic water column conditions in the sapropel. Correspondingly, the highly reactive Fe pool (FeHR) measured in Fe speciation studies is dominated by Fe(oxyhydr) oxide minerals in the background sediments, whereas pyrite (Fepy) becomes the dominant component of the FeHR pool in the sapropel. Maximum Fepy values in the sapropel coincide with peak productivity and reducing conditions, implying a clear link between trace element uptake, diagenetic bacterial sulphate reduction in anoxic porewater and Fe mobilization in the sapropel. Iron isotope compositions (δ 56 Fe) in the sapropel do not show any departure from primary (marine and detrital) source sediment values, and the absence of an Fe/Al vs. δ 56 Fe trend strongly argues against an Fe shuttle. Molybdenum isotopes, however, show marked non-conservative fractionation patterns. Background sediment δ 98 / 95 Mo values (0. 2 to 0. 7 ‰) are compatible with fractionation upon absorptive uptake by Fe (oxyhydr) oxides and pyrite. In contrast, minimum δ 98 / 95 Mo values exhibited at peak sapropel (reducing and pyrite producing) conditions are most closely modeled by Mo isotope fractionation during kinetically controlled conversion of aqueous molybdate to thiomolybdate species. The conservative Fe isotope behavior/Mo isotope fractionation minima in the sapropel may be a characteristic of organic-rich sediment diagenesis below an anoxic non-sulphidic water body, without the operation of a benthic Fe shuttle...|$|E
40|$|The sediments of {{the eastern}} Mediterranean Sea contain Corg-rich layers, termed sapropels, {{interbedded}} with Corg-poor sediments which form by far {{the greater part of}} the sedimentary record. This research presents a high-resolution geochemical investigation on slowly- and rapidly-accumulated SI units. Mn, Fe, I and Se profiles in slowly-accumulated SI units (5 - 10 cm. kyr" 1) have shown that these sapropels are affected by post-depositional oxidation following their formation which produces a much thinner sapropel than was originally deposited. In the slowly-accumulated examples investigated, up to 11. 5 cm of the original sapropel has been lost through oxidation in as little as 6 kyr. Downward progression of the redox front causes the remobilisation and re-arrangement of redox-sensitive elements (As, Fe, I, Mn, Mo, Se, U and V) around the oxic/post-oxic boundary. Concentration-depth profiles of the redox-sensitive elements in SI have shown that these elements are immobilised in oxic and post-oxic conditions or both. It is noted that I and Se form well-defined peaks at the top of SI, and it is suggested that these two elements may be reliable markers for defining the location of an active oxidation front in the absence of pore water measurements. During this research, it was discovered that Hg behaves similarly to I and Se at the oxic/postoxic boundary, forming a well-defined peak in post-oxic conditions. In turbidite and sapropel examples, Hg is always closely associated with Se and it is suggested that Hg and Se become immobilised through the formation of the selenide mineral tiemannite (HgSe). The presence and persistence of Hg peaks in both recent and ancient sediments (up to 4 Ma) implies that Hg may be a useful diagnostic tool for defining the locations of both active and relict oxidation fronts. Investigation of two rapidly-accumulated Sis from the Adriatic (MD 90 - 917) and Aegean Seas (LC 21) has shown that these cores have suffered negligible post-depositional oxidation due to rapid accumulation rates. The validity of the Ba/Al ratio as a more reliable and persistent productivity index has been confirmed in both LC 21 and MD 90 - 917 where Ba/Al is directly related to Corg content over the entire visual SI units. In both cores SI appears as a doublet. This doublet is centred on 7. 5 kyr BP and geochemical and micropalaeontological evidence indicates that this "saddle" is best interpreted as an episode of improved <b>reventilation</b> and increased deep-water O 2 concentrations. A number of redox-sensitive elements are enriched (Cr, Mo, Ni, S, Se, U, V and Zn) in LC 21 and MD 90 - 917, and exhibit double peaks in their concentrationdepth profiles. The principal routes by which SI develops high authigenie levels of redox-sensitive elements are: (i) pre-concentration in the water column by biological uptake followed by deposition at the sedimentwater interface and/or (ii) diffusion from seawater through pore waters into sediments followed by reduction and immobilisation under more reducing conditions. Under more reducing conditions, redox-sensitive elements are immobilised through associations with Corg, pyrite, sulphides or form insoluble solid phases (e. g. U is precipitated and immobilised as UO 2 (S)). Palaeoproductivity estimates based on Ba/Al weight ratios indicate that productivity was up to 5 times higher during SI formation compared with the present. It is suggested that high productivity was initiated by the formation of a deep chlorophyll maximum formed in response to an increased input of freshwater into the eastern Mediterranean. During SI formation, the flux of Corg greatly exceeded the supply of dissolved O 2 to the bottom waters and so it is inferred that deposition of SI occurred under anoxic conditions. Interpretations of geochemical parameters such as S/C criteria, I/Corg and V/(V+Ni) ratios and framboidal pyrite sizes all indicate that bottom waters were anoxic-non sulphidic rather than anoxic-sulphidic during SI formation. The geochemical interpretation is in agreement with the benthic foraminiferal data, which show that the two S 1 layers have an abundance of low-oxygen tolerant species. It is unclear whether anoxic conditions are induced by increased productivity alone or through a combination of increased productivity and reduction in deep-water formation. Evidence presented indicates that productivity and preservation are both necessary prerequisites for SI deposition. SI initiation and cessation was investigated by AMS 14 C dating based upon the Ba/Al ratio criterion. AMS 14 C ages for slowly-accumulated sapropels indicate that SI formation started at 10 kyr BP and ended by 5. 3 kyr BP. For the rapidly-accumulated cores, the onset and termination of SI is more variable although SI was underway by 9. 5 kyr BP and complete by 6. 0 kyr B. P. The offset in ages is attributed to bioturbation mixing artefacts affecting the Ba/Al signal in the slower-accumulated cores. Since rapidly-accumulated cores are not significantly affected by bioturbation, the best estimate for the duration of SI is 9. 5 - 6. 0 kyr B. P...|$|E
