In 1988 the U.S. Department of Education audited the GCTC {{and asked for}} the 1.3 million back. In July 1988 the department revoked GCTC's authority to award grants, with the <b>revocation</b> <b>date</b> retroactively being March 1984. In 1990 the GCTC sued the U.S. Department of Education in federal court, asking for the authority to distribute Pell Grants.|$|E
50|$|The Internal Revenue Code defines {{many kinds}} of {{non-profit}} organizations that do not pay income tax. However, only charitable organizations can receive tax-deductible contributions and avoid paying property and sales tax. For instance, a donor would receive a tax deduction for money given to a local soup kitchen if the organization was classified as a 501(c)(3) organization, but not for giving money to the National Football League, even though the NFL is a 501(c)(6) non-profit association. Neither a public charity nor a foundation can pay for or participate in partisan political activity, unless they surrender tax-exempt status including voiding the deductibility of any tax deductions for donors after the surrender or <b>revocation</b> <b>date.</b>|$|E

40|$|SPKI/SDSI is a {{proposed}} {{public key infrastructure}} standard that incorporates the SDSI public key infrastructure. SDSI's key innovation {{was the use of}} local names. We previously introduced a Logic of Local Name Containment that has a clear semantics and was shown to completely characterize SDSI name resolution. Here we show how our earlier approach can be extended to deal with a number of key features of SPKI, including <b>revocation,</b> expiry <b>dates,</b> and tuple reduction, without invoking nonmonotonicity. We show that these extensions add relatively little complexity to the logic. We then use our semantics to examine SPKI's tuple reduction rules. Our analysis highlights places where SPKI's informal description of tuple reduction is somewhat vague, and shows that extra reduction rules are necessary in order to capture general information about binding and authorization. ...|$|R
