The main findings of this paper are: In liquid times money market funds enhanced their returns by investing in less liquid papers. By doing so they outperformed other funds as long as liquidity in the market was high. Investing in less liquid assets, however, widens the narrow structure of money market funds and makes them vulnerable to runs.

We analyze the feedback between lender-of-last-resort policy and incentives of private banks, determining the aggregate amount of liquidity available.

In addition, we analyze the impact of equity requirements and narrow banking, {{in the sense that}} banks are required to hold sufficient <b>liquid</b> <b>funds</b> so as to pay out in all contingencies. We show that both policies are strictly inferior to imposing minimum liquidity standards ex ante combined with lender-of-last-resort policy. ...|$|R

We then propose and analyze a model of the federal funds market where uncertain liquidity flows and transaction costs induce banks to delay trading and to bid up interest rates {{at the end of each}} maintenance period. In this context, the central bank’s interest-rate-smoothing policy causes a high supply of <b>liquid</b> <b>funds</b> to be associated with high interest rates around reserve settlement days.

50|$|Another {{trend that}} may see more action within {{the near future}} as venture capital funds {{continue}} to be scarce is {{an increasing number of}} strategic partnerships between firms that are based not on exchange of funds, but rather on exchange of technologies or process information. These types of partnerships, also known as corporate in-kind investments, may become increasingly common as <b>liquid</b> <b>funds</b> become less available but technologies that have been developed are readily shareable. One specific example of this sort of information exchange is a partnership between a large, well-established company and a small, developing company who have complementary technologies or processes. Such 'David and Goliath' partnerships are already starting to emerge outside of the healthcare industry and will likely emerge within healthcare soon.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the investment timing of firms facing two dimensions of financing constraints: Liquidity constraints and capital market frictions inducing financing costs. We show that liquidity constraints {{are not sufficient}} to explain voluntary investment delay. However, when additionally considering financing costs, we can explain both voluntary delay and acceleration of investment. More precisely, we find that investment thresholds are U-shaped in <b>liquid</b> <b>funds.</b> For high-liquidity firms, investment thresholds are decreasing (i. e., accelerated investment takes place) in either dimension of financing constraint. In contrast, investment thresholds are increasing (i. e., investment is further delayed) in either form of financing constraint for low-liquidity firms. For intermediate levels of liquidity, investment thresholds are U-shaped in market frictions. Copyright (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R
