50|$|CISH {{has some}} {{advantages}} over FISH in the <b>reagents</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> it uses.

In addition, the CISH reagents are more stable than the FISH reagents so {{it is possible to}} store the samples and examine the same sample multiple times. FISH reagents fade overtime due to photobleaching so a sample can only be examined once. Apart from the expensive fluorescence microscope, FISH also requires a high-resolution digital camera to capture micrographs of the sample before the fluorescence fades. Another advantage of using bright-field microscopy is that the tissue or cell sample as a whole can be visualized through CISH whereas cell morphology is difficult to assess using fluorescence microscopy in FISH.|$|E

50|$|The focus forming assay (FFA) is a {{variation}} of the plaque assay, but instead of relying on cell lysis in order to detect plaque formation, the FFA employs immunostaining techniques using fluorescently labeled antibodies specific for a viral antigen to detect infected host cells and infectious virus particles before an actual plaque is formed. The FFA is particularly useful for quantifying classes of viruses that do not lyse the cell membranes, as these viruses would not be amenable to the plaque assay. Like the plaque assay, host cell monolayers are infected with various dilutions of the virus sample and allowed to incubate for a relatively brief incubation period (e.g., 24-72 hours) under a semisolid overlay medium that restricts the spread of infectious virus, creating localized clusters (foci) of infected cells. Plates are subsequently probed with fluorescently labeled antibodies against a viral antigen, and fluorescence microscopy is used to count and quantify the number of foci. The FFA method typically yields results in less time than plaque or TCID50 assays, but it can be more expensive in terms of required <b>reagents</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment.</b> Assay completion time is also dependent on the size of area that the user is counting. A larger area will require more time but can provide a more accurate representation of the sample. Results of the FFA are expressed as focus forming units per milliliter, or FFU/mL.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP) detec-tion {{is important}} for early diagnosis, clinical prognostics, and disease prevention, and a rapid and sensitive low-cost SNP detection assay would be valuable for resource-limited clinical settings. We present a simple platform that enables sensitive, naked-eye detection of SNPs with minimal <b>reagent</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> requirements at room temperature within 15 min. SNP detection is performed in a single tube with one set of DNA probe-modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), a single exonuclease (Exo III), and the target in question. Exo III’s apurinic endonucleolytic activity differentially processes hybrid duplexes between the AuNP-bound probe and DNA targets that are perfectly matched or contain a single-base mismatch. For perfectly matched targets, Exo III’s exonuclease activity facilitates a process of target recycling that rapidly shears DNA probes from the particles, generating an AuNP aggregation-induced color change, whereas no such change occurs for mis...|$|R

40|$|Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a {{widespread}} technique that allows collection of pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF) and evaluation of integrity of the lower airways. The instillation of isotonic solution needed for collection results in significant dilution of the PELF. Due to its ability to freely cross biologic membranes urea is commonly used as a marker of PELF dilution. Nevertheless, the previously established methodology is difficult to be reproduced, especially since it utilizes <b>reagents</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipments</b> {{that are difficult to}} obtain.

A standard curve of known urea dilutions in equine BALF provided a linear regression equation that allowed calculation of unknown urea concentrations in BALF samples. The mean estimated PELF volume was 0. 52 ± 0. 12 mL. The mean PELF percentage in relation to recovery BALF was 0. 39 ± 0. 08 %.

40|$|We {{developed}} and evaluated a PCR-based assay to detect four Plasmodium species in 79 blood samples from 56 travelers returning from areas where malaria is endemic. DNA amplification targeting a small {{region of the}} 18 S rRNA gene was performed with Plasmodium genus-specific primers. The biotinylated PCR products were then identified by PCR-colorimetric Covalink NH microwell plate hybridization (CMPH) using species-specific phosphorylated probes covalently bound to a pretreated polystyrene surface. The results from PCR-CMPH showed high specificity, and for 47 of the 56 patients (84 %), microscopy and PCR-CMPH results were in agreement. Discordant results were reevaluated with microscopy examination, other molecular methods, and DNA sequencing. Except for one patient, discrepancies were resolved in favor of PCR-CMPH: three mixed infections were detected, four species identification errors were corrected, and two negative results were shown to be positive.

40|$|Many successes {{have been}} {{achieved}} in HIV care in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) : increased number of HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART), wide decentralization, reduction in morbidity and mortality and accessibility to cheapest drugs. However, these successes should not hide existing failures and difficulties. In this paper, we underline several key challenges. First, ensure long-term financing, increase available resources, {{in order to meet}} the increasing needs, and redistribute the overall budget in a concerted way amongst donors. Second, increase ART coverage and treat the many eligible patients who have not yet started ART. Competition amongst countries is expected to become a strong driving force in encouraging the least efficient to join better performing countries. Third, decrease early mortality on ART, by improving access to prevention, case-finding and treatment of tuberculosis and invasive bacterial diseases and by getting people to start ART much earlier. Fourth, move on from WHO 2006 to WHO 2010 guidelines. Raising the cut-off point for starting ART to 350 CD 4 /mm 3 needs changing paradigm, adopting opt-out approach, facilitating pro-active testing, facilitating task shifting and increasing staff recruitments. Phasing out stavudine needs acting for a drastic reduction in the costs of other drugs. Scaling up routine viral load needs a mobilization for lower prices of <b>reagents</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipments,</b> as well as efforts in relation to point-of-care automation and to maintenance. The latter is a key step to boost the utilization of second-line regimens, which are currently dramatically under prescribed. Finally, other challenges are to reduce lost-to-follow-up rates; manage lifelong treatment and care for long-term morbidity, including drug toxicity, residual AIDS and HIV-non-AIDS morbidity and aging-related morbidity; and be able to face unforeseen events such as socio-political and military crisis. An old African proverb states that the growth of a deep-rooted tree cannot be stopped. Our tree is well rooted in existing field experience and is, therefore, expected to grow. In order for us to let it grow, long-term cost-effectiveness approach and life-saving evidence-based programming should replace short-term budgeting approach...|$|R
