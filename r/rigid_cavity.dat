40|$|K+ ions {{seemingly}} permeate K-channels rapidly because channel binding sites mimic {{coordination of}} K+ ions in water. Highly selective ion discrimination should occur when binding sites form <b>rigid</b> <b>cavities</b> that match K+, {{but not the}} smaller Na+, ion size or when binding sites are composed of specific chemical groups. Although conceptually attractive, these views cannot account for critical observations: 1), K+ hydration structures differ markedly from channel binding sites; 2), channel thermal fluctuations can obscure sub-Ångström differences in ion sizes; and 3), chemically identical binding sites can exhibit diverse ion selectivities. Our quantum mechanical studies lead to a novel paradigm that reconciles these observations. We find that K-channels utilize a “phase-activated” mechanism where the local environment around the binding sites is tuned to sustain high coordination numbers (> 6) around K+ ions, which otherwise are rarely observed in liquid water. When combined with the field strength of carbonyl ligands, such high coordinations create the electrical scenario necessary for rapid and selective K+ partitioning. Specific perturbations to the local binding site environment with respect to strongly selective K-channels result in altered K+/Na+ selectivities...|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} main {{outcomes}} of a continuum theory for the equilibrium of {{the interface between}} a nematic liquid crystal and an isotropic environment, in which the surface free energy density bears terms linear in the principal curvatures of the interface. Such geometric contributions to the energy occur together with more conventional elastic contribution, leading to an effective azimuthal anchoring of the optic axis, which breaks the isotropic symmetry of the interface. The theory assumes the interface to be fixed, as for a <b>rigid</b> <b>cavity</b> filled with liquid crystal, and so it {{does not apply to}} drops. It should be appropriate when the curvatures of the interface are small compared to that of the molecular interaction sphere. Also, interfaces bearing a sharp edge are encompassed within the theory; a line integral expresses the energy condensed along the edge: we see how it affects the equilibrium equations...|$|E

The points may be material particles, vertex of a rigid polyhedra, or nodes from a finite element discretization of continuous deformable body. The non-penetration condition is enforced with an augmented Lagrangian technique, which is applied after a regularization of the original unilateral constraint. The analysis of the presented methodology shows that exact enforcement of the non-penetration condition with exact energy conservation is only achieved for some particular geometries and configurations prior to contact. This analysis is supported by two numerical examples that illustrate these difficulties and show the overall performance of the methodology...|$|E

We find that unlike in <b>rigid</b> <b>cavities,</b> friction {{plays a key role}} by giving rise to the emergence of two distinct packing patterns. At low friction, the wire densely coils into an ordered toroidal bundle with semi-ellipsoidal cross section, while at high friction, it packs into a highly disordered, hierarchic structure.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} a pressure-displacement {{formulation}} based on the finite-element method of an elastoacoustic coupling problem. Since directly solving the resulting system isCPU intensive for large models, the solution is usually based on only a few uncoupled structural modes in vacuum and <b>rigid</b> <b>cavity</b> modes. However this classical pressuredisplacement formulation leads to nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems. Furthermore, if this method is accurate for weak coupling models, significant errors occur when the truncated modes are coupled to the ones used in the analysis. The present paper suggests a method combining the pseudostatic correction of the truncated modes in modal analysis with a symmetrization technique of the eigenvalue problems. It allows the calculation of the real coupled modes and frequencies, {{as well as the}} computation of an accurate elastoacoustic response, even for the strong coupling of a structure with a heavy fluid (liquid).

A scalar field is analysed with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, and a photon field under perfect conductor boundary conditions is shown to decompose into Dirichlet-like and Neumann-like polarisation modes. The Dirac spinor is analysed with a nonvanishing mass and with dimensions transverse to the acceleration, and the MIT bag boundary condition is shown to exclude zero modes. Unitarity of time evolution holds for smooth accelerations but fails for discontinuous accelerations in spacetime dimensions (3 + 1) and higher.

40|$|A compact {{flow-through}} plate silencer {{is constructed}} for low frequency noise control using new reinforced composite plates. The concept {{comes from the}} previous theoretical study [L. Huang, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 119 (2006) 2628 - 2638] which concerns a clamped supported plate enclosed by <b>rigid</b> <b>cavities.</b> When the grazing incident sound wave comes and induces the plate into the vibration, it will radiate sound and reflect sound. Such sound reflection causes a desirable noise reduction from low to medium frequency with wide broadband. The structural property of the very light plate with high bending stiffness is very crucial element in such plate silencer. In this study, an approach to fabricate new reinforced composite panel with light weight and high flexibility to increase the bending stiffness is developed in order to realize the function of this plate silencer practically. The plate silencer can be constructed in more compact size compared with the previous two-plate silencer with two rectangular cavities and the performance with the stopband of the range from 229 to 618 Hz, in which the transmission loss is higher than 10 dB over the whole frequency band without flow or with flow {{at the speed of}} 15 m/s, can be achieved. The experimental data also proves that the non-uniform clamped plates with thinner ends perform very well. To implement the use of such silencer practically in controlling noise at different dominant frequency ranges, a design chart has been established for searching the optimal bending stiffness and corresponding stopband at different geometries. ...|$|R
