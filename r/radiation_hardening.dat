5|$|For an answer, McElroy {{turned to}} the Re-entry Body Identification Group (RBIG), a {{sub-group}} of the Gaither Committee led by William E. Bradley, Jr. that had been studying the issue of penetrating a Soviet ABM system. The RBIG had delivered an extensive report on the topic on 2 April 1958 which suggested that defeating a Soviet ABM system would not be difficult. Their primary suggestion was to arm US missiles {{with more than one}} warhead, a concept known as Multiple Re-entry Vehicles (MRV). Each warhead would also be modified with <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening,</b> ensuring only a near miss could damage it. This would mean that the Soviets would have to launch at least one interceptor for each US warhead, while the US could launch multiple warheads without building a single new missile. If the Soviets added more interceptors to counter the increased number of US warheads, the US could counter this with a smaller number of new missiles of their own. The cost balance was always in favor of the offense. This basic concept would remain the primary argument against ABMs for the next two decades.|$|E

Semiconductor {{devices such as}} diodes, transistors and ICs contain p–n junctions, and will not function correctly if they are illuminated by unwanted electromagnetic radiation (light) of wavelength suitable to produce a photocurrent; this is avoided by encapsulating devices in opaque housings. If these housings are not completely opaque to high-energy radiation (ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays), diodes, transistors and ICs can malfunction due to induced photo-currents.

50|$|One {{technique}} {{that can be}} used to reduce the soft error rate in digital circuits is called <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening.</b> This involves increasing thecapacitance at selected circuit nodes in order to increase its effective Qcrit value. This reduces the range of particle energiesto which the logic value of the node can be upset. <b>Radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> is often accomplished by increasing the size of transistors who sharea drain/source region at the node. Since the area and power overhead of <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> can be restrictive to design, the technique is often applied selectively to nodes which are predicted to have the highest probability of resulting in soft errors if struck. Tools and models that canpredict which nodes are most vulnerable are the subject of past and current research in the area of soft errors.|$|E
