40|$|A {{software}} package {{has been developed}} and implemented on a BBC microcomputer system which allows borehole data to be entered into disc files and full borehole logs, including both graphical and textual components, to be prepared automati-cally from the stored data. The operator can select the <b>required</b> <b>format</b> and scale from a menu of standard options or can set up any required special layout. Any required scale can be selected and log headings may be printed in either the English or French language. Once a set of data has been entered into a disc file, the information can be replotted at will to any <b>required</b> <b>format</b> and scale. Thus, after having prepared a detailed log at say 1 : 50 scale, the same data can be replotted as a summary log at, for example, 1 : 200 for direct inclusion in an interpretative drawing and as a simplified log at 1 : 100 scale. Detailed borehole logs can be prepared using the computer system with man-hour inputs of around 30 % of those required to prepare similar logs manually. Overall cost savings increase dramatically {{if there is a}} need to replot the same data to produce summary or simplified logs as would be required for the preparation of interpretative r ports and drawings...|$|R
40|$|Effective written {{communication}} of calculations and problem solutions {{is one of}} the most important skills a novice engineer must master. The format described in this document allows engineers to effectively document the method of solution of typical “closed‐ended problems ” as well as allow other engineers to double‐check the work for correctness. It also allows faculty and graders to be effective in locating technical errors and other types of mistakes and provide effective feedback to the student (developing engineer). The document also includes information concerning the standards to be applied to calculation, tables and graphs. It is recognized that each company, industry or agency may have different <b>required</b> <b>formats</b> for recording engineering work. The fact that these variations exist does not make one format correct and the others incorrect but rather supports the idea that familiarity and adherence to a particular format facilitates the communication of engineering work. Herein presented are those format elements that the Department of Chemical Engineering at Auburn University has adopted. These standards should be considered to be a requirement for homework submitted in all courses offered by the department. A homework problem or assignment that does not adhere to the <b>required</b> <b>format</b> will have point...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{compiled}} in two parts. Each part {{is an independent}} piece of work intended for separate publication. Consequently each part has separate page numbering. The list part is a literature review with relevant appendices attached. The second part is a research report incorporating the collection and analysis of data. This research report also has its own appendices. A general appendices section {{at the end of}} the thesis supplies documentation not included in either the literature review or the study. The literature review is to be submitted to the Clinical Psychology Review and the research report to the Journal of Family Psychology. Each of these Journals require American Psychological Association (APA) formatting and American spelling which have therefore been adopted throughout both pieces of work.
