5|$|Acquisition {{of second}} and {{additional}} languages can come at any age, through exposure {{in daily life}} or courses. Children learning a second language {{are more likely to}} achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very <b>rare</b> <b>for</b> someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{had three}} {{different}} kinds of pitches: a sinking fastball (which is <b>rare</b> <b>for</b> a lefty), a curveball, and a split. His fastball travelled in the low nineties, and while his curveball was not fast, it had late breaking action and {{got a lot of}} swing-throughs. Affeldt induced groundballs at a high rate with his sinking fastball and could also get the strikeout when the situation called for it.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of Diddy Kong Racing, another team {{was working on a}} new game known as Dinosaur Planet for the Nintendo 64. However, Shigeru Miyamoto, a Nintendo executive, demanded the team to recreate the game as a Star Fox title for Nintendo's new console, the GameCube. Unlike previous Star Fox games, Star Fox Adventures focused on ground-based open world exploration. The game received positive reviews upon its launch in 2002. Star Fox Adventures was the only game developed by <b>Rare</b> <b>for</b> GameCube.|$|E

5|$|Depictions in {{classical}} art are <b>rare</b> <b>for</b> such striking birds. The only known Ancient Egyptian {{example is a}} relief, probably of a little green bee-eater, on a wall of Queen Hatshepsut's mortuary temple, and an early Roman mural depicting blue-cheeked bee-eaters {{was found in the}} villa of Agrippina. Bee-eaters have been depicted on the postage stamps of at least 38 countries, the European and Carmine bee-eaters being the most common subjects, with 18 and 11 countries respectively.|$|E

5|$|For example, {{the unusual}} {{placement}} of the cadenza before the recapitulation {{is reflected in the}} violin concertos of Tchaikovsky (where the cadenza is similarly placed) and Sibelius (where the cadenza serves to extend the development section). Moreover, following this concerto it was very <b>rare</b> <b>for</b> a composer to leave a cadenza unwritten for the soloist to improvise as in the days of Mozart and Beethoven. The linking of the three movements also influenced other concertos, such as Liszt's Second Piano Concerto.|$|E

5|$|Game {{development}} costs gradually increased, and Nintendo {{did not provide}} Rare with more capital nor did they purchase the company's remaining stake. According to Rare founders Tim and Chris Stamper, they were surprised that Nintendo did not directly acquire the studio. Rare then looked for potential buyers. In early 2000, workers from Activision and Microsoft began visiting Rare with purchase offers. Rare was interested in Activision's offer, but the deal collapsed and on 24 September 2002 Microsoft purchased <b>Rare</b> <b>for</b> $375 million. Rare became a first-party developer for Microsoft's Xbox. Character trademarks from games developed by <b>Rare</b> <b>for</b> Nintendo consoles, such as Conker of Conker's Bad Fur Day and Banjo of the Banjo-Kazooie series, were retained by Rare; intellectual property created by Nintendo, such as Donkey Kong and Star Fox, were retained by Nintendo. This left Donkey Kong Racing, due for release for the GameCube, unreleased. 30 employees left Rare during the transition.|$|E

5|$|Officials from Trinidad and Tobago {{reported}} that Joyce made landfall in that country. The National Hurricane Center differs, not attributing any landfall to Joyce.

In addition, Joyce moved south of west for a time at a location where it is <b>rare</b> <b>for</b> tropical cyclones to do so.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of a woman writing {{in the press and}} composing poetry in this dark era was a significant event.

5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} among the first two launch titles for the Nintendo64, but missed the release window. Gold released in North America on November 25, 1996, and in other countries the following year, on May 9, 1997. Its soundtrack received a compact disc release, which was <b>rare</b> <b>for</b> Western video games in the 1990s.

It was released in Japan by Jaleco under the title Densetsu no Kishi Elrond on July15, 1988. The game would be Rare's second NES release, after Slalom. The game's soundtrack was composed by video game composer David Wise.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax (PSP) tends {{to occur in}} a young adult without underlying lung problems, and usually causes limited symptoms. Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting features. People who are affected by PSPs are often unaware of potential danger and may wait several days before seeking medical attention. PSPs more commonly occur during changes in atmospheric pressure, explaining to some extent why episodes of pneumothorax may happen in clusters. It is <b>rare</b> <b>for</b> PSPs to cause tension pneumothoraces.|$|E

5|$|According to modern-day analysis, a {{tropical}} depression {{developed in the}} Pacific Ocean, south of El Salvador, early on September 27. It drifted northward across Central America and eastern Mexico before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico near Ciudad del Carmen on September 30. Weather reports had indicated low air pressures over the area for several days. It is relatively <b>rare</b> <b>for</b> {{a tropical}} cyclone to cross from the Pacific into the Atlantic, or vice versa, and this storm is among less than a dozen known to have officially done so. Only three other tropical cyclones have crossed from the eastern Pacific into the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Concentric castles {{were widely}} copied across Europe, for {{instance}} when Edward I of England– who had himself been on Crusade– built castles in Wales {{in the late}} 13thcentury, four of the eight he founded had a concentric design. Not all {{the features of the}} Crusader castles from the 13thcentury were emulated in Europe. For instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the main gate in the side of a tower and for there to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is <b>rare</b> <b>for</b> this bent entrance to be found in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Diddy Kong Racing {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon release. The graphics, audio and gameplay {{were the most}} praised aspects of the game, however minor criticism was directed at its repetitiveness. The game has sold 4.8 million copies since release and stands as the Nintendo 64's eighth best-selling game. A cancelled sequel, Donkey Kong Racing, was in development for the GameCube, however it was abandoned after Microsoft's purchase of <b>Rare</b> <b>for</b> £375 million in 2002. An enhanced remake for the Nintendo DS titled Diddy Kong Racing DS was released worldwide in 2007.|$|E
