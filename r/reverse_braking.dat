40|$|Actuating torque {{data from}} field testing of a 122 -centimeter (48 in.) {{butterfly}} valve with a hydro/pneumatic actuator is presented. The hydraulic cylinder functions {{as either a}} forward or a <b>reverse</b> <b>brake.</b> Its resistance torque increases when the valve speeds up and decreases when the valve slows down. A reduction of flow resistance in the hydraulic flow path {{from one end of}} the hydraulic cylinder to the other will effectively reduce the hydraulic resistance torque and hence increase the actuating torque. The sum of hydrodynamic and friction torques (combined resistance torque) of a butterfly valve is a function of valve opening time. An increase in the pneumatic actuating pressure will result in a decrease in both the combined resistance torque and the actuator opening torque; however, it does shorten the valve opening time. As the pneumatic pressure increases, the valve opening time for a given configuration approaches an asymptotical value...|$|R

40|$|AbstractReaction {{flywheel}} is {{a significant}} actuator for satellites’ attitude control. To improve output torque and rotational speed accuracy for reaction flywheel, this paper reviews the modeling and control approaches of DC–DC converters and presents an application of the variable structure system theory with associated sliding regimes. Firstly, the topology of reaction flywheel is constructed. The small signal linearization process for a buck converter is illustrated. Then, based on the state averaging models and reaching qualification expressed by the Lee derivative, the general results of the sliding mode control (SMC) are analyzed. The analytical equivalent control laws for reaction flywheel are deduced detailedly by selecting various sliding surfaces at electromotion, energy consumption <b>braking,</b> <b>reverse</b> connection <b>braking</b> stages. Finally, numerical and experimental examples are presented for illustrative purposes. The results demonstrate that favorable agreement is established between the simulations and experiments. The proposed control strategy achieves preferable rotational speed regulation, strong rejection of modest disturbances, and high-precision output torque and rotational speed tracking abilities...|$|R

50|$|Aquaplaning {{may reduce}} the {{effectiveness}} of wheel braking in aircraft on landing or aborting a takeoff, when it can cause the aircraft to run {{off the end of}} the runway. Aquaplaning was a factor in an accident to Qantas Flight 1 when it ran off the end of the runway in Bangkok in 1999 during heavy rain. Aircraft which can employ <b>reverse</b> thrust <b>braking</b> have the advantage over road vehicles in such situations, as this type of braking is not affected by aquaplaning, but it requires a considerable distance to operate as it is not as effective as wheel braking on a dry runway.|$|R
50|$|Such {{propellers}} {{are used}} in propeller-driven aircraft to adapt the propeller to different thrust levels and air speeds so that the propeller blades don't stall, hence degrading the propulsion system's efficiency. Especially for cruising, the engine can operate in its most economical range of rotational speeds. With the exception of going into <b>reverse</b> for <b>braking</b> after touch-down, the pitch is usually controlled automatically without the pilot's intervention. A propeller with a controller that adjusts the blade pitch so that the rotational speed always stays the same is called a constant-speed propeller. A propeller with controllable pitch can have a nearly constant efficiency over a range of airspeeds.|$|R
50|$|A controllable-pitch {{propeller}} (CPP) or variable-pitch propeller {{is a type}} of propeller with blades {{that can}} be rotated around their long axis to change the blade pitch.

50|$|If a track hub is not available, or if a {{beginner}} wishes {{to try a}} fixed gear bicycle without buying a new hub or rear wheel, track cogs can be installed on a standard Freewheel hub using a right hand threaded ISO English bottom bracket lockring as the lockring for the cog (the threads are exactly the same). This may work for some lighter, or delicate riders, but any repeated <b>reverse</b> or <b>braking</b> pressure on the pedals will eventually cause the cog and lockring to come loose.

50|$|In the 1990s, {{high-speed}} trains {{began to}} use lighter, lower-maintenance three-phase AC induction motors.
