May be turned to finished thickness, {{in which case}} the differential shrinkage of the wood will result in a finished piece that is not perfectly round. Alternatively, it may be [...] "rough turned". Rough turning involves turning the piece only to its general shape, leaving enough thickness so that after turning it can be allowed to dry to equilibrium moisture content and distort. The advantage over first drying the wood then turning is that a <b>rough</b> <b>turned</b> piece dries faster, will probably distort instead of split as solid wood tends to, and that wet wood turns better, since it creates less dust. Rough turning is inexact science: turning wood too thick will lead to splits, turning wood too thin will lead to distortion that cannot be removed, because not enough thickness is left. Once dry, it is mounted on the lathe a second time and turned to its final form. Rough turning is typically used on most functional work and some artistic pieces.|$|E

Calculations show that the elastic real area of contact is very small compared to the plastic real area of contact, and that local compliance due to flattening of asperity tips is a small proportion of the total compliance obtained from experiments. The fact that increased load brings more and more new asperities under load rather than enlarging the contact spots leads to a rather simple load-compliance relation for a rough cylinder, viz., W' = Nh · K 1 δn, where W 0 = K 1 δn defines the load-compliance relation of the individual asperities, and Nh represents the number of asperities bearing the load...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMachining {{large-scale}} {{parts in}} several industries (nuclear, naval, energy…) {{is a challenge}} for machine tools operators. Various problems are encountered, like respecting specified dimensions, deformation of the workpiece during machining, limit of the cutting speed, excessive tool wear, etc. All these difficulties {{are related to the}} large size of the machined part, which may have several meters and weigh several hundred kilograms. This study focuses on analysis of the <b>rough</b> <b>turning</b> process of a shell component, having few meters, as a part of steam generators of nuclear power plants. During the <b>rough</b> <b>turning</b> step, a high material removal rate (moderate cutting speed, but high depth-of-cut and feed rate) is necessary to achieve the workpiece in reasonable time. Experimental and theoretical analyses are conducted to highlight the intense thermomechanical loading at the tool–workmaterial interface. Revealed physical phenomena at the tool rake face, like adhesion and abrasive wear types, using various characterization techniques, are reproduced by a numerical model developed to simulate the cutting process. As an interest result, contact discontinuities at the tool–chip interface as well as where the wear is highly localized are well predicted as observed on scanning electron microscope. These contact discontinuities are attributed to the grooved rake face of the insert, designed with a chip breaker to reduce the tool–chip contact area and to promote the chip fragmentation. This study can be helpful for the design of <b>rough</b> <b>turning</b> inserts, by analysing the effectiveness of the rake face geometry (contact area, chip breaker…) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the analytical {{studies of the}} behaviour of the bodies in contact, particularly with reference to those used in work-holding fixture systems under the action of a static loading. The analyses {{lead to the development}} of formulae to predict the deformation of three different systems which commonly occur in practice. For the case of a spherical locator in contact with a flat work-piece, the limit of elasticity is reached so early that the work-piece always deform plastically. Hardness and Meyer constant play important roles in determining the diameter of the indentation and hence the total deformation of the system at the contact zone. The theoretical predictions are in agreement with the experimental values. Shawski's empirical formulae do not follow the experimental results very well, particularly for hard work-pieces, his formula gives negative deformations. For the case of a flat locator in contact with rough surface work-pieces of varying hardness, the asperities deform plastically while the material supporting them deforms elastically. The peak heights of the asperities are assumed to be isotropic and represented by the normal probability distribution. The deformation of the asperities can be evaluated accurately by the theory of Williamson up to q/M =. 1 where q and M are the applied pressure and the Meyer hardness of the work-piece respectively. Our theoretical predictions for the deformations of the rough work-pieces indented by a flat locator show better agreement with the empirical formulae of Shawki than the theoretical curves proposed in his article. The compression of a cylinder by two narrow bands of pressure of distribution [formula here] (β is a real number) is found. The displacement of a semi-infinite solid under the same band of pressure is similarly derived. These results are combined with the deformation of the asperities to produce the approach of two hard planes compressing a <b>rough</b> <b>turned</b> cylinder of the same material. The asperities deform plastically while the material of the cylinder supporting the asperities and the planes deform elastically. The analysis ceases to apply when the cylinder and the planes start deforming plastically. This study may be used as an approximation for the evaluation of the approach of two Vee locators compressing a rough cylinder investigated by Shawki...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{experimental}} investigation and numerical modelling {{of the tool}} wear in <b>rough</b> <b>turning</b> of large dimensions components of nuclear power plants made of 18 MND 5 steel. The tool wear has been characterised experimentally at microscopic scale using observations of different zones of the engaged cutting part at the tool rake face. A model has been developed to predict the tool wear as observed on images. The major finding of the paper concerns the prediction of contact discontinuities at the microscopic scale on the tool rake face and where the wear process is highly localized. These discontinuities are attributed to the complex geometry of the rake face of the grooved cutting insert, designed especially to reduce the tool–chip contact area and to promote the chip breakage. The cutting force, specific cutting force and chip morphology parameters are also predicted and compared to experimental trends.

40|$|Due {{to their}} poor machinability, {{titanium}} alloys {{need to be}} worked at low cutting speeds to prevent a fast tool failure caused by the very high temperatures that are reached at the tool-chip interface. As demonstrated by previous works by the authors, an improvement of productivity for Titanium alloys {{can be obtained by}} adopting cryogenic cooling during the machining operations. The present work shows the features of a toolholder specifically designed for cryogenic adduction in turning operations, following Hong’s design guidelines. The paper compares tool life results between traditional and cryogenic <b>rough</b> <b>turning</b> by adopting Grade 5 titanium as the working material. <b>Rough</b> <b>turning</b> is economically more relevant to the machining industry, especially in the aerospace field where generally a large quantity of rough material has to be removed due to the very high buy-to-fly ratio of aerospace components. A full factorial experimental plan was performed basing on typical <b>rough</b> <b>turning</b> parameters. Machining outputs such as forces, roughness, temperatures, friction coefficients were calculated in order to define statistical differences between cryogenic cooling method using the special toolholder and traditional oil water emulsion cooling system. Furthermore, thanks to tool life results the Taylor’s law for cryogenic and traditional cases was calculated and an hypothetical production scenario for Ti 6 Al 4 V parts was analysed. An analytical model to calculate production costs and time was built for both cooling methods. A 4 -turrets turning centre was considered and cooling methods and costs per hour of machine tool were taken into account in a cost model. The results show that the benefits in terms of tool life offered by liquid nitrogen cooling allows to improve productivity by adopting higher optimal cutting parameters. This improvement, coupled to an increase of tool life, is very significant and allows not only to reduce time of production but also to cover the major costs of liquid nitrogen and have a slight reduction of machining total costs...|$|R

Thus far, increasing the level of automation in <b>rough</b> <b>turning</b> has included process monitoring methods or adaptive turning control methods that aim to keep the process conditions constant.

In this study, primary and secondary chatter and chip formation are studied to understand how to measure the effect of these phenomena to the process conditions and how to avoid undesired cutting conditions.

The measures to the phenomena are not developed based on physical measures, but instead, the severity of the measures is modelled against expert opinion.
