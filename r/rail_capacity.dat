25|$|Coal railway {{lines were}} closed and {{numerous}} mine sites flooded. According to an analysist at Macquarie Group almost all the available stockpiles of coking coal in Queensland were exhausted in late January 2011 due to reduced <b>rail</b> <b>capacity.</b> About 15% of the state's annual output of coal production was lost and by late March 2011 recovery was progressing slowly. Four months after the floods the Dalrymple Bay coal terminal was operating at half its capacity as the open-cut mines in the region continued to deal with de-watering issues.|$|E

The rail sector is monopolized by China Railways, which {{is controlled by}} the Ministry of Railways and there is wide variation in services provided. In late 2007 China became one of the few countries in the world to launch its own indigenously developed high-speed train. As <b>rail</b> <b>capacity</b> is struggling to meet demand for the transport of goods and raw materials such as coal, air routes, roads and waterways are rapidly being developed to provide an increasing proportion of China's overall transportation needs.|$|E

25|$|After {{lobbying}} by Churchill, who was keen {{to bring}} the Channel Ports under British control, and by Wilson, French lobbied Joffre (27 September) for the BEF, which was less heavily gunned and more mobile than a similarly-sized French Army, to disengage and try to move around the Allied left flank, part of the outflanking movements known as the Race to the Sea. Joffre agreed in principle, although he had private doubts about having no French troops between the BEF and the sea and later {{came to believe that}} this move had, by using up scarce <b>rail</b> <b>capacity</b> for ten days, prevented him from reinforcing Lille and had allowed the Germans to capture it.|$|E
25|$|While the Hudson Tunnel Project {{would double}} the number of tracks under the Hudson River, it would not result in an {{increase}} in <b>rail</b> <b>capacity</b> due to constraints at Penn Station. Penn Station operates at capacity during peak periods, and since {{it takes a long time}} for passengers to board and alight trains, trains cannot leave and enter the station as might otherwise be possible. Even with improvements in the station, there are inadequate train storage facilities at Penn, and there is no capacity in the East River Tunnels to allow for trains to be stored during middays at Sunnyside Yard. Without these additional improvements, it is assumed that the same number of trains going between New Jersey and New York today would be operating in 2030, albeit with the additional tunnel capacity.|$|E
25|$|Manchester Airport railway station, {{opened in}} May 1993, is between Terminals 1 and 2. It {{is linked to}} the {{terminals}} by a Skylink moving walkway. Trains operated by Northern or TransPennine Express connect the airport to Manchester Piccadilly station and other railway stations, mainly throughout northern England, including Crewe, Wigan and Southport. A third rail platform was completed in 2008 to allow for an increase in <b>rail</b> <b>capacity.</b> In 2009, Network Rail stated that the third platform meant that capacity will become constrained by the layover of the trains and recommended building a line underneath the Airport towards Northwich by 2024. On 28 January 2013, the Government announced the Airport will be included in the 2nd stage of High Speed 2 which will provide links with other British cities like Birmingham and London and also a quicker route into Central Manchester. Work on building a new fourth platform commenced in early 2014 with a blockade required in February 2015 to allow completion. Construction finished in May 2015 and the platform opened to passengers in Autumn 2015.|$|E

40|$|The Aldabra White-Throated Rail Dryolimnas cuvieri aldabranus, {{endemic to}} Aldabra Atoll (Seychelles), {{has long been}} {{considered}} the last flightless bird of the western Indian Ocean islands. However, this study represents the first quantitative approach to determine the <b>rail's</b> <b>capacity</b> for sustained, level flight. Morphological, physiological and behavioral aspects are considered in determining its actual and theoretical capacity for flight. Wing loading calculations suggest that it can fly. All other evidence, most importantly the greatly reduced breast musculature, indicate flightlessness. The Aldabra Rail originated from Madagascar, where the nominate form is volant, but only weakly. The Aldabra Rail evolved as a ground forager {{in the absence of}} any adult predation, i. e. without any apparent need to fly. This, combined with energetic advantages to becoming flightless, has led to the Aldabra <b>Rail</b> losing its <b>capacity</b> for flight...|$|R
50|$|To further {{increase}} <b>rail</b> transport <b>capacity,</b> {{there is}} a large ongoing programme of upgrades to the network, including Thameslink, Crossrail, electrification of lines, in-cab signalling, the Northern Hub, new inter-city trains, and a new high-speed line.|$|R
25|$|As {{part of the}} Gateway Program, two new tunnels {{would be}} built under the Hudson River, {{doubling}} the <b>rail</b> <b>capacity</b> under the Hudson River. Construction on the tunnel, assuming that adequate funding is received, would start in 2019. The purpose of the Hudson Tunnel Project is to allow Amtrak and New Jersey Transit to continue running between New York and New Jersey while the deteriorating North River Tunnels get repaired. These tunnels were inundated by seawater from Superstorm Sandy in October 2012, and combined with being over a century old, component failures regularly occur within them, resulting in frequent delays. The North River Tunnels need to be repaired without major reductions in weekday service, making it necessary to have new tunnels built. Once the new tunnels open in 2026, the two North River Tunnels would close for repairs, {{one at a time}}, with the existing level of service maintained. They will be closed one at a time as without one of the North River Tunnels in service, the existing level of service cannot be maintained. This is due because the new tunnel would be located further south–there would be no access to Track 19, and Tracks 9-18 would only have access to the tunnel by the single I ladder-track. Once the two North River Tunnels reopen in 2030, capacity on the line would be doubled. The Hudson Tunnel Project would also allow for resiliency on the Northeast Corridor to be increased, making service along the line more reliable with redundant capacity.|$|E
