40|$|Purified {{vaccinia virus}} was {{irradiated}} by 7 -rays under direct-effect on-ditions. The {{ability of the}} irradiated samples to form plaques (infectivity) and to induce viral DNA synthesis was determined. The <b>radiosensitive</b> <b>volume</b> of the viral unit causing infection (I. 9 × IO-X 7 cm 2) is very small com-pared with {{the volume of the}} whole viral DNA (~ IO %). The inactivation of the DNA replication function follows a simple exponential law. The <b>radiosensitive</b> <b>volume</b> necessary for the replication of DNA (1 - 6 × IO-is cm. a) represents only 8 " 5 % of the DNA necessary for infectivity and o' 85 % of the total viral DNA. This indicates existence of a dis-sociation between two functions of vaccinia virus, the synthesis of viral DNA and infectivity...|$|E
