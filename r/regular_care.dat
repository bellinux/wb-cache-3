5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both accepted the Medicaid expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive health care services and less likely to incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills than before the expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and <b>regular</b> <b>care</b> for chronic conditions.|$|E

60|$|But if {{we should}} admonish the {{tradesman}} to an exact and <b>regular</b> <b>care</b> of his books, even in his declining fortunes, much more should it be his care in his beginning, and before any disaster has befallen him. I doubt not, that many a tradesman has miscarried by the mistakes and neglect of his books; for the losses that men suffer on that account are not easily set down; but I recommend it to a tradesman to take exact care of his books, as I would to every man {{to take care of}} his diet and temperate living, in order to their health; for though, according to some, we cannot, by all our care and caution, lengthen out life, but that every one must and shall live their appointed time,[34] yet, by temperance and regular conduct, we may make that life more comfortable, more agreeable, and pleasant, by its being more healthy and hearty; so, though the exactest book-keeping cannot be said to make a tradesman thrive, or that he shall stand the longer in his business, because his profit and loss do not depend upon his books, or the goodness of his debts depend upon the debtor's accounts being well posted, yet this must be said, that the well keeping of his books may be the occasion of his trade being carried on with the more ease and pleasure, and the more satisfaction, by having numberless quarrels, and contentions, and law-suits, which are the plagues of a tradesman's life, prevented and avoided; which, on the contrary, often torment a tradesman, and make his whole business be uneasy to him for want of being able to make a regular proof of things by his books.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the barriers in <b>regular</b> dental <b>care</b> and home care and to assess their association with age, sex, education and income. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 427 randomly selected individuals, 248 males and 179 females. Data were collected by a pre-tested, selfadministered 14 question questionnaire. The answer "very much" was scored as one, "to some degree" as two and "not at all" as three. The data was described and analyzed by frequency distribution and chi square test with P 0. 05), but females experienced higher dental fear (P< 0. 001). The younger age group had more visits within one year in comparison to the older. Increase in education, decreases the barriers for <b>regular</b> dental <b>care.</b> Income had a significantly negative correlation with dental visit (P= 0. 02). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that males believed in having <b>regular</b> dental <b>care.</b> Cost of the treatment also affected the dental visits, but the distance they had to travel to get the dental treatment was not much significant.

40|$|Differences are {{investigated}} between female practice {{populations of}} female general practitioners providing women's {{health care and}} {{of women and men}} general practitioners providing <b>regular</b> health <b>care.</b> Women's health care in the Netherlands is provided in the general practice "Aletta" and is based on the following principles: (1) consideration of the patient's gender identity and gender roles; (2) consideration of the patient's personal and social situation; (3) treating the patient respectfully; (4) encouraging the patient to cope with health problems and stimulating self- responsibility; and (5) avoidance of medicalization. Data were derived from an extensive health interview with 253 women Aletta patients (15 years or older) about socio-demographic characteristics, gender role, attitudes, somatic and mental health status, and medical consumption. The Aletta patients were also asked about their motives in choosing women's health care. Reference groups were comprised of 391 and 628 women patients of women and men general practitioners, respectively, providing <b>regular</b> health <b>care.</b> Logistic regression analyses were performed to explain differences between the three groups. "The Aletta patient" can be characterized as a young, urban, single, highly educated, working, and childless woman, who deliberately chooses women's health care. She is more androgynous than women of other doctors, less inclined to seek help with the GP, she suffers more from psychosomatic and psychosocial problems, and she has poorer mental health. It results in a higher use of mental health care, and also of alternative health care. Women patients of women and men doctors providing <b>regular</b> health <b>care</b> hardly differ between each other in the characteristics described above. Health policy makers should take into consideration that in the future possibly more women will prefer health care in which the ideas of women's health care are being applied. The integration of some important aspects of women's health <b>care</b> into <b>regular</b> health <b>care</b> is recommended. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
