50|$|Environment Ministry {{officials}} {{state that}} the 49.97 lakh tonnes of sand mining reported in the Indian Bureau of Mines Year Book for 2011 is a gross underestimate. The guidelines under the Central and the state enactments, call for a sketch of the mining area when a mining lease is applied for. It was found by the Lokayukta that sometimes the actual mining areas {{are not related to}} the sketch given with the applications without officials crosschecking them. Further mining applicants falsely claim a prohibited forest area as a revenue area. Finally the actual area of the mine is much bigger than the claimed area.The Indian Bureau of Mines rules which control the type of mining, allow a maximum mining depth six metres to prevent environmental degradation. But miners have flouted this rule to over-extract iron-ore. For example, if they are allowed to take 100 metric tones, mines take 1,000 metric tonnes. Officials at <b>road</b> <b>check</b> posts reportedly collude in a massive under-counting of lorries and trucks transporting the iron-ore from the Bellary mines to the ports. News reports suggest that only 200 trucks are reported as against 4000 plying everyday.|$|E

[...] All three were included in a larger Multiple Property Submission for Oak Ridge-related properties. [...] In 1999, the Department of Energy (DOE), the AEC-successor agency that currently controls the Bear Creek Road and Oak Ridge Turnpike properties, as well as the small structure on the Bethel Valley property, restored the large structures at the checking stations at the Oak Ridge Turnpike and Bear Creek Road sites. [...] The large structure at the Bethel Valley Road site belongs to Lockheed Martin who obtained it with the Commerce Park property in 1984 when Martin Marietta took over the managing and operating contract for the three DOE sites in Oak Ridge as well as the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Portsmouth, Ohio, and the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, Kentucky.

40|$|Aerial {{photographs}} {{have been}} evaluated manually by the operators {{for a long time}} for the extraction of the vector data. The development of computer technology and digital image processing technologies provide to perform these extraction processes automatically or semi-automatically. Image segmentation can be used for automatic and semi-automatic feature extraction and classification of images. In recent years, image segmentation and the front propagation of the segments have been carried out successfully by the Level Set and Fast Marching methods. In this study, a semi-automatic line extraction method, based on the segmentation of the images using color-differences of the pixels and the propagation of the fronts by the Level Set algorithms, is developed. An object oriented application software is also developed to test the capabilities of the developed method. Some semiautomatic feature extraction applications are made by the help of the developed software using a 1 : 16000 scale black/white aerial photograph for determining the capabilities of this method. Another application with 1 : 5000 scaled two ortho images which have 0. 50 m resolution. These ortho images are generated from 1 : 16000 scale color aerial photographs. In this test area, an accuracy test is also carried out to find the accuracy of the developed method. The accuracy test is carried out in two groups. In the first group, on 422 <b>road</b> <b>check</b> points, measurements are made and the root square mean is found as ± 0. 66 m.

40|$|The Clarks Fork Corridor will {{potentially}} experience {{change in}} the future as the result of Yellowstone National Park policy and development of Wyoming State 292. To determine the use of this region at the present time the data for the United States national forests in the region was compiled. Information regarding the use of the private lands was derived by personal interviews and surveys. Forty per cent of the second home owners were personally interviewed between July 16, 1973 and July 7, 1973, and eighty-five per cent of the business operators were surveyed during this same time period. Travel patterns and use of the present road system was investigated by means of a highway survey. <b>Road</b> <b>check</b> stations were established for three days on both US 212 and the Crandall Read, and all traffic was s topped. The data acquired indicates that timber is being reservoired, mineral deposits explored (though not actively mined), and grazing and recreation use of the land is on the increase. Sixty-nine per cent of the second home owners have acquired their sites since 1963, and land values have increased in response to this demand. The Crandall Road is used as an access into the Corridor, and US 212 is basically a tourist route for Yellowstone National Park. The eighteen square miles of private property will come under increasing use pressure as change occurs. A land use base study is the necessary basis for all land planning. This thesis provides this basis for the Clarks "Fork Corridor, an area which is currently on the threshold of change and in need of land planning...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{looks at}} {{incidents}} of unrest in social housing neighbourhoods in the peripheral areas (banlieues) of French {{cities in the}} 1990 s. It first focuses on {{the responses of the}} French state, and demonstrates how such areas have been constituted as 'menace' and such incidents as 'violence', through the state's discursive articulations. Then, by providing an account focused on the incidents themselves, it argues that these incidents are responses to various forms of injustice, from discrimination and police brutality to constantly increasing unemployment. They are, in other words, manifestations of contention, raising claims for justice, and not merely acts of violence. 'Justice Movements'? This paper is not about 'justice movements'—organised or in the making—as such. It is about the responses of the French state to incidents of social unrest in the banlieues (literally, suburbs) of large cities in France in the early 1990 s. Such incidents are not covered in the literature on new social movements in France (see, for example, Waters, 1998; Appleton, 1999). They are not social movements in the more conventional sense either, if one follows Buechler's definition of social movements as " intentional, collective efforts to transform social order " (Buechler, 2000, p. 213). They are neither preconceived nor organised, and they are not articulated as collective efforts aimed at transforming the established order. However, they are not intrinsic acts of violence either. They all mobilise with a demand for justice and/or as reactions against perceived injustices. 'Let justice be done' or 'J'ai la haine', 1 as was heard—again—during the recent incidents in one of the banlieues of Strasbourg, following the 'accidental' killing of a person of immigrant origin by the police with a bullet in the head during a routine police <b>road</b> <b>check</b> (Libération, 22 March 2004) —a form of casualty not uncommon as the triggering incident of unrest in the banlieues (Rajsfus, 2002) ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{topic of}} the diploma thesis bears the title Possibilities of using {{technical}} means of narcotics <b>checks</b> in <b>road</b> traffic. The thesis endeavours to describe, compare and evaluate searching methods {{that are used in}} <b>road</b> <b>checks</b> for habit-forming drugs by public officials. The theoretical part is focused on the description of individual groups of habit-forming drugs and their effects on the human organism. Further, the theoretical part contains an overview of the most frequently used analytic methods. The practical part deals with the questions of detection aids used by the traffic police in the Czech Republic. Based on the methodology used, which included research in domestic and foreign sources and a structured interview, all the information obtained was thoroughly evaluated and it illustrates the substance of the topic. This diploma thesis is structured {{in such a way that}} enables its use by police units and other organisations that take part in fighting the use of habit-forming drugs. The thesis can be also a contribution for tuition as study material...|$|R
40|$|The {{transportation}} of freight by truck has been fully deregulated and opened to {{competition in the}} European Union, without any quotas or restrictions since Huly 1998. This deregulation has caused problems, mainly due to the delay in adopting common fiscal and social measures, <b>road</b> <b>checks</b> and sanctions for firms that commit offenses. Unscrupulous companies have used this legal vacuum in the EU to factitiously "outsource" activities and dodge national rules and regulations about taxes, labor relations and welfare. As a result, working conditions have worsened as barriers have been lifted. By definition, turnover is high among wage-earners. Truck drivers, semi-skilled, have become interchangeable on the EU marketplace. They can be profitably replaced with drivers from eastern Europe (Poland, Romania, Bulgaria), who are much cheaper and less protected. The spread of such practices is a cause of concern for labor organizations in Europe. Shipping by truck is a textbook case for analyzing how the EU is trying to counter the devious effects arising out of the deregulation of {{a branch of the}} economy. (c) 2006 Elsevier SAS.
