Nonetheless, the majority of researches have been focused on game development and do not emphasize on motion analysis. In this thesis a set of tools are provided to detect certain motion pattern for rehabilitation, coaching or other similar area. A novel set of tracking signals, originated from joints data of body movement, along with their selection algorithm is proposed. The signals are utilized by a novel time-varying motion pattern detection algorithm which operates in the time domain and only needs one sample of a training pattern. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on a group of five people performing seven types of exercises 10 times each, giving 350 samples. The performance evaluation shows significant success of the proposed algorithm. Also in spite of low <b>recall</b> <b>factors,</b> the results promise the high potential of future use of the algorithm.

METHODS: This study used the database assembled by the Canadian Heart Health Surveys Research Group between 1986 and 1992 [...] a stratified representative sample comprising 23, 129 Canadian residents aged 18 to 74. Nurses administered a standard questionnaire asking respondents to list the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease: fat in food, smoking, lack of exercise, excess weight, elevated blood cholesterol and high blood pressure. Six logistic regressions {{examined the}} multivariate associations between ability to <b>recall</b> each risk <b>factor</b> with education, income adequacy, occupation, sex, age, marital status and province of residence. RESULTS: More people knew about the behaviour-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease than about the physiologic risk factors: 60 % recalled fat in food, 52 % smoking and 41 % lack of exercise, but only 32 % identified weight, 27 % cholesterol and 22 % high blood pressure. Education was the socioeconomic status indicator most strongly and consistently associated {{with the ability to}} <b>recall</b> risk <b>factors</b> for cardiovascular disease.

40|$|Abstract: Architecture-centric {{software}} evolution enables {{change in}} a system’s structure and behaviour while maintaining a global view of the software to address evolution-centric trade-offs. The existing solutions for architectural maintenance and evolution fall short of exploiting generic and reusable expertise to address recurring evolution problems. We present a pattern language {{as a collection of}} interconnected change patterns that enable reuse-driven and consistent evolution of component-based software architectures. Pattern interconnections represent possible relationships among patterns (such as variants or related patterns) in the language. In general, we introduce architecture change mining (pattern language development) as a complementary and integrated phase to facilitate reuse-driven architecture change execution (pattern language application). We evaluate the language applicability to support pattern-driven reuse in architecture evolution of a payment system case study. We also analyse the precision and <b>recall</b> <b>factor</b> as a measure of selecting the most appropriate pattern(s) from the language collection. The pattern language itself continuously evolves with an incremental discovery of new patterns from change logs over time...|$|E
40|$|A new {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} to incorporate prosodic processing into speech recognition, where the accent nuclei {{at the head}} of words are detected automatically and used to limit the searching space in speech recognition, that is, to preselect candidate words. Especially in this paper, the proposed method for the automatic detection of the accent nuclei and its performance are described. Using this scheme, it is expected that the recognition speed is improved. This scheme is derived from a nding by perceptual experiments conducted previously by the rst author. Results of the experiments indicated that the accent nucleus at the rst mora has acceleration e ect on perceiving the word. This effect {{can be explained by the}} earlier identi cation of the word accenttype as type 1 byits nucleus at the rst mora. In other words, the accent nucleus {{at the head of}} a word can limit the searching space e ectively in the mental lexicon. This mechanism was implemented using HMMs and examined for isolated words on a machine, where the vowel detection by broad segmental features and the rejection of words with a devoiced vowel at the rst or second mora were introduced at the same time. Evaluation experiments showed 94. 7 % and 90. 0 % as <b>recall</b> <b>factor</b> and precision factor of the accent nucleus detection respectively. 1...|$|E

Factor I was marked by 7 items which stressed rehearsal, retrieval and recall of information and was refferred to as the Elaboration by <b>recall</b> <b>factor.</b> Factor II, which was called the Elaboration in daily life comprised 6 items which represented the use of systematic study techniques and autobiographical lnformation. Factor III comprised 5 items which indicated summarizing and discrimination for memorizing information and it was called the Between-item and Within-item Elaboration factor. Multiple regression indicated that the Elaboration by recall scale explained 3 % of test performances, but the Elaboration in daily life and the Between-item and Within-item Elaboration scales did not.

The to be recalled items consisted of 20 pictured objects from five semantic categories: furniture, transportation, food, tools, and clothing, each category represented by four objects. The subjects were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions, which were combinations of mode of presentation (blocked vs. random) and recall condition (cued vs. non-cued);Six dependent variables were measured: item recall, category recall, within-category recall, recall time, number of category repetitions, and clustering in recall. A 2 (grade) x 2 (sex) x 2 (mode of presentation) x 2 (time of recall) x 2 (recall condition) analysis of variance with repeated measures on the time of <b>recall</b> <b>factor</b> was performed for each of the six dependent measures. For most of the dependent variables, immediate recall was better than delayed recall, performance of the fourth graders was superior to second graders, items presented in a blocked manner were recalled better than those presented randomly, and the presence of a retrieval cue at the time of recall enhanced recall performance. However, these main effects were qualified by interaction effects, most frequently a 3 -way interaction between time, grade, and recall condition. Separate analyses of variance for each time of recall indicated that on most dependent measures, non-cued recall performance during immediate recall was better than during delayed recall for both second and fourth graders; however, in the cued condition the fourth graders showed better performance during delayed than during immediate recall, while the second graders performed better during immediate than during delayed recall;In general, the evidence of this and similar studies suggests that age-related changes in the contents of the knowledge system, variations in mode of presentation of to-be-recalled material, and increases in the ease with which information can be retrieved contribute to more efficient mnemonic functioning...|$|E

40|$|The work {{is based}} on the {{assumption}} that Italian southern regions are worldwide known touristic attractions that have been characterized by strong migrating processes in the past century. On these basis, their numerous tourist Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) could attempt to take advantage of the strong <b>recalling</b> <b>factor</b> exercised on emigrants in order to strengthen the related “return tourism” flows. In particular we suggest that emigrant themselves could return (at least once in a lifetime) to their ancestors’ land, but mostly could play an important role in the stimulation of their homeland’s positive image in the foreign country in which they moved in, developing the related tourism flow. The above hypothesis is deeply analysed within an ongoing project, commissioned by Foreign Affairs’ Italian Ministry, conducted by Cilento National Park and IRAT- National Research Council. Scope of the project is to investigate on the relational reinforcement between the Cilento SMEs and the foreign countries (United States, Canada, Australia, South America, Argentina, etc.) institutional and private parties, regarding both incoming tourism flows and typical products’ export. The idea that territorial areas may identify specific actions focused on international tourism market stimulation, for their tourism SMEs’ benefit, is hence verified according to systemic strategies, within network theories that highlight aggregating forces toward the system’s territorial centre: the Cilento National Park. In this optic, the Park may assume a guidance role, improving its governance capacity, that may result in the promotion of the territorial socio-economical development, enabling tourist market’s growth as much as the identification of tourist international paths. Evidences show that, in order to accomplish the aim of the project, it seems important to stabilize these relationships, to let them become a network structural component, focused on tourism valorisation of Cilento areas, with a continuous and systematic effort. In other words network has to create synergies not only within local SMEs, but also with far distant actors of the demand, such as emigrants and their communities...|$|R

The data reported here are part of a wider study that developed and tested a condition-specific, online parent information and support application with {{children and young people}} with chronic-kidney disease, parents and professionals. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 fathers and 24 mothers who had recently tested the novel application. Data were analysed using Framework Analysis and the Communities of Practice concept. Results: Evolving communities of child-healthcare practice were identified comprising three components and several sub components: (1) Experiencing (parents making sense of clinical tasks) through Normalising care, Normalising illness, Acceptance & action, Gaining strength from the affected child and Building relationships to formalise a routine; (2) Doing (Parents executing tasks according to their individual skills) illustrated by Developing coping strategies, Importance of parents' efficacy of care and Fear of the child's health failing; and (3) Belonging/Becoming (Parents defining task and group members' worth and creating a personal identity within the community) consisting of Information sharing, Negotiation with health professionals and Achieving expertise in care.
