5|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Berry was {{the fourth}} child {{in a family of}} six. He grew up in the north St. Louis {{neighborhood}} known as the Ville, an area where many middle-class people lived. His father, Henry William Berry (1895–1987), was a contractor and deacon of a nearby Baptist church; his mother, Martha Bell (Banks) (1894–1980), was a certified public school principal. Berry's upbringing allowed him to pursue his interest in music from an early age. He gave his first public performance in 1941 while still a student at Sumner High School; he was still a student there in 1944, when he was arrested for armed robbery after robbing three shops in Kansas City, Missouri, and then stealing a car at gunpoint with some friends. Berry's account in his autobiography is that his car broke down and he flagged down a passing car and stole it at gunpoint with a nonfunctional pistol. He was convicted and sent to the Intermediate <b>Reformatory</b> for Young Men at Algoa, near Jefferson City, Missouri, where he formed a singing quartet and did some boxing. The singing group became competent enough that the authorities allowed it to perform outside the detention facility. Berry was released from the <b>reformatory</b> on his 21st birthday in 1947.|$|E

5|$|Darabont {{purchased}} the film rights to King's story in 1987, but development {{did not begin}} until five years later when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. Two weeks after submitting his script to the Castle Rock Entertainment film studio, Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce The Shawshank Redemption, which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set in Maine, principal photography took place almost entirely in Mansfield, Ohio, with the Ohio State <b>Reformatory</b> serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many notable stars of {{the time for the}} lead roles including Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, and Kevin Costner. Thomas Newman provided the film's score.|$|E
5|$|From August 29 to September 1, 2013, {{a series}} of events were held in Mansfield, Ohio, to {{celebrate}} the 20th anniversary of the film.

The cocktail party was attended by Gunton, Scott Mann and James Kisicki, who signed autographs and shared stories with the fans. Darabont sent a video greeting the fans who celebrated the anniversary. More than 6,000 fans of the film attended these events.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Chandler urged {{implementation}} of the state's first rural roads program and development of electrical infrastructure with assistance from the federal Rural Electrification Act. He implemented an old-age assistance program authorized by an earlier constitutional amendment and in 1938, proposed another amendment that would add dependent children and needy blind people to the state's assistance rolls. He increased funding to the state's hospitals and asylums, and personally aided with the evacuation of the Frankfort Penitentiary during the Ohio River flood of 1937. Following the flood, Chandler convinced the legislature to construct a new <b>reformatory</b> at La Grange.|$|E

5|$|Marvin {{spent five}} months {{scouting}} prisons across the United States and Canada, {{looking for a}} site that had a timeless aesthetic, and was completely abandoned, hoping to avoid the complexity of filming the required footage, for hours each day, in an active prison with the security difficulties that would entail. Marvin eventually chose the Ohio State <b>Reformatory</b> in Mansfield, Ohio {{to serve as the}} fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, citing its Gothic-style stone and brick buildings. After nearly a century of use, the facility had been closed three years earlier on New Year's Eve, 1990, due to inhumane living conditions.|$|E

5|$|At a {{young age}} Saint-Just had shown a fascination with literature, and during his stay at the <b>reformatory</b> he used his time to begin writing a lengthy poem. He {{published}} it anonymously {{more than two years}} later, in May 1789, at the very outbreak of the Revolution. The 21-year-old Saint-Just thereby added his own touch to the social tumult of the times with Organt, poem in twenty cantos. The poem, a medieval epic fantasy, relates the quest of young Antoine Organt. It extols the virtues of primitive man, praising his libertinism and independence while blaming all present-day troubles on modern inequalities of wealth and power. Written in a style mimicking Ariosto, it gave a juvenile foreshadowing of his own political extremism. Spiked with brutal satire and scandalous pornographic episodes, it also made unmistakable attacks upon the monarchy, the nobility, and the Church.|$|E

5|$|At age seven, Ruth {{was sent}} to St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a <b>reformatory</b> where he learned life lessons and {{baseball}} skills from Brother Matthias Boutlier of the Christian Brothers, the school's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player. In 1914, Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles but was soon sold to the Red Sox. By 1916, he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs, a feat unusual for any player in the pre-1920 dead-ball era. Although Ruth twice won 23 games in a season as a pitcher {{and was a member}} of three World Series championship teams with Boston, he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder. With regular playing time, he broke the MLB single-season home run record in 1919.|$|E

5|$|Early the {{following}} morning, Varley {{was promoted to}} brigadier and took over as commander of the 22nd Brigade from Taylor, who was taken ill. In Varley's place, Major Charles O'Brien, who had previously been the battalion second-in-command, took over command of the battalion. After a brief lull in the fighting in the 22nd Brigade's sector, the Japanese 18th Division attacked again, attempting to take the brigade on its left flank. In response, the 2/18th was sent to retake some of the high ground south-east of the Ulu Pandan and <b>Reformatory</b> Roads late in the afternoon. Attacking with about 60 men, supported by three British armoured cars and artillery fire, {{they were unable to}} retake the position after the light failed. The Japanese then pressed heavily against the 22nd Brigade's position, and they were forced to give ground, falling back to the junction of Buona Vista and Holland Roads, by which time the 2/18th was down to only 250 men.|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to present the results of {{qualitative}} research on emotions management strategies among teachers. The research is based on semi-structured interviews, documents analyses and observations carried out at schools and <b>reformatories.</b> The theoretical part of the article based on the theory of Arlie Hochschild concerning emotional supervision by workplace circumstances. Moreover we use also Theodore D. Kemper’s conception of emotions created during interactions typical for social relations. In this paper we are trying to characterize negative emotions arousing among teachers working in <b>reformatories,</b> primary and special schools...|$|R
5|$|The Baden disputation {{exposed a}} deep rift in the Confederation {{on matters of}} religion. The Reformation was now {{emerging}} in other states. The city of St Gallen, an affiliated state to the Confederation, was led by a reformed mayor, Joachim Vadian, and the city abolished the mass in 1527, just two years after Zurich. In Basel, although Zwingli had {{a close relationship with}} Oecolampadius, the government did not officially sanction any <b>reformatory</b> changes until 1 April 1529 when the mass was prohibited. Schaffhausen, which had closely followed Zurich's example, formally adopted the Reformation in September 1529. In the case of Bern, Berchtold Haller, the priest at St Vincent Münster, and Niklaus Manuel, the poet, painter, and politician, had campaigned for the reformed cause. But it was only after another disputation that Bern counted itself as a canton of the Reformation. Four hundred and fifty persons participated, including pastors from Bern and other cantons as well as theologians from outside the Confederation such as Martin Bucer and Wolfgang Capito from Strasbourg, Ambrosius Blarer from Constance, and Andreas Althamer from Nuremberg. Eck and Fabri refused to attend and the Catholic cantons did not send representatives. The meeting started on 6 January 1528 and lasted nearly three weeks. Zwingli assumed the main burden of defending the Reformation and he preached twice in the Münster. On 7 February 1528 the council decreed that the Reformation be established in Bern.|$|E
