5000|$|TCP reset attack, {{also known}} as [...] "forged TCP resets", [...] "spoofed TCP reset packets" [...] or [...] "TCP reset attacks", {{is a way to}} tamper and {{terminate}} the Internet connection by sending forged TCP <b>reset</b> <b>packet.</b> This tampering technique can be used by a firewall in goodwill, or abused by a malicious attacker to interrupt Internet connections.|$|E
50|$|Connection reset: If a {{previous}} TCP connection is {{blocked by the}} filter, future connection attempts from both sides can also be blocked for some variable amount of time. Depending on {{the location of the}} block, other users or websites may also be blocked, if the communication is routed through the blocking location. A circumvention method is to ignore the <b>reset</b> <b>packet</b> sent by the firewall.|$|E
50|$|TCP/IP HijackingTCP/IP Hijacking {{is another}} way that uses spoofed packets {{to take over a}} {{connection}} between the victim and a host machine. This technique is mainly used to collect passwords when a host machine uses a password to be connected to. When this type of attack takes place the victim and the attacker must be on the same network. Another form of TCP/IP hijacking is RST hijacking, which involves injecting a fake <b>reset</b> <b>packet.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In 2006, Comcast {{implemented}} measures using Sandvine hardware which sends forged TCP RST (<b>reset)</b> <b>packets,</b> disrupting multiple protocols used by peer-to-peer {{file sharing}} networks. [...] This prevented most Comcast users from uploading files.|$|R

50|$|The Sandvine {{application}} uses {{a different}} approach to disrupt BitTorrent traffic by making seeding impossible. Sandvine intercepts peer-to-tracker communication to identify peers based on the IP address and port numbers in the peer list returned from the tracker. When Sandvine later sees connections to peers in the intercepted peer lists, it may (according to policy) break these connections by sending counterfeit TCP resets. Various solutions exist to protect against Sandvine's attack including encrypting both peer-to-tracker and peer-to-peer communication, using Microsoft's Teredo so that TCP connections are tunneled within UDP packets, filtering TCP resets before they reach the TCP layer in the end-host, or switching entirely from a TCP-based transport to a UDP-based transport. Each solution has its trade-offs. Filtering out TCP resets typically requires kernel access, and the participation of the remote peer since Sandvine sends the <b>reset</b> <b>packet</b> to the local and remote peers.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{independent}} testing, Comcast injected <b>reset</b> <b>packets</b> into peer-to-peer connections, which effectively caused a certain {{limited number of}} outbound connections to immediately terminate.

40|$|Abstract. The {{so-called}} “Great Firewall of China ” operates, in part, by inspecting TCP packets for keywords {{that are}} to be blocked. If the keyword is present, TCP <b>reset</b> <b>packets</b> (viz: with the RST flag set) are sent to both endpoints of the connection, which then close. However, because the original packets are passed through the firewall unscathed, if the endpoints completely ignore the firewall’s resets, then the connection will proceed unhindered. Once one connection has been blocked, the firewall makes further easy-to-evade attempts to block further connections from the same machine. This latter behaviour can be leveraged into a denial-of-service attack on third-party machines. ...|$|R

It is able to issue warning at the early stage of worm propagation and to provide necessary information for security analysts to control the damage. The system monitors a "used" address space. Unlike the traditional approach that keeps track of SYN packets, it relies on <b>RESET</b> <b>packets</b> to find the scan sources, which has greater accuracy and less overhead. The system is resilient to anti-monitor measures. Particularly, a sophisticated protocol is designed to distinguish faked scan sources from real scan sources. We provide an analytical study on the properties and effectiveness of this early warning system, and back up our claims by numerical results...|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, Comcast, {{the largest}} cable {{company in the}} US, {{was found to be}} {{blocking}} or severely delaying BitTorrent uploads on their network using a technique which involved creating <b>reset</b> <b>packets</b> (TCP RST) that appeared to come from the other party. An August 2007 report noted that ISPs had been throttling BitTorrent traffic for almost two years, since 2005, but Comcast was completely blocking it in at least some cases. On March 27, 2008, Comcast and BitTorrent reached an agreement to work together on network traffic where Comcast was to adopt a protocol-neutral stance [...] "as soon as the end of 2008", and explore ways to [...] "more effectively manage traffic on its network at peak times." [...] In December 2009 Comcast reached a proposed settlement of 16 million, admitting no wrongdoing and amounting to no more than 16 per share.|$|R

5000|$|The Associated Press {{confirmed}} a {{story by}} TorrentFreak that indicates that Comcast [...] "actively interferes with attempts by some of its high-speed Internet subscribers to share files online, a move that runs counter to the tradition of treating all types of Net traffic equally." [...] Legal controversy ensued when Comcast terminated BitTorrent connections by sending forged RST packets represented as coming from the end users rather than from Comcast. This was through a partnership with Sandvine. This effectively blocks the user from {{making full use of}} BitTorrent. The controversy arises because Comcast is impersonating end users in terminating connections. Recently, a few Comcast users claimed to find temporary solutions for both Microsoft Windows and Linux systems by using a firewall to filter RST packets. This however was later revealed to be futile as {{it would have to be}} implemented on both ends—if the other end did not ignore the spoofed RST packet, the connection would be severed on the remote end.Now there is also evidence of Comcast using RST packets on groupware applications that have nothing to do with file sharing. Kevin Kanarski, who works as a Lotus Notes messaging engineer, noticed some strange behavior with Lotus Notes dropping emails when hooked up to a Comcast connection and has managed to verify that Comcast's <b>reset</b> <b>packets</b> are the culprit.

In 2013, a massive distributed {{denial of service}} (DDoS) attack was launched against Spamhaus causing the service to shut down. In this paper, we present a three-way handshaking server for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection redirection utilizing TCP header options. When a legitimate client attempted to connect to a server undergoing an SYN-flood DDoS attack, it will try to initiate a three-way handshake. After it has successfully established a connection, the server will reply with a <b>reset</b> (RST) <b>packet,</b> in which a new server address and a secret is embedded.

5000|$|Reports in August 2007 {{indicated}} that Comcast was preventing BitTorrent seeding by monitoring and {{interfering with the}} communication between peers. Protection against these efforts is provided by proxying the client-tracker traffic via an encrypted tunnel to a point outside of the Comcast network. Comcast has more recently called a [...] "truce" [...] with BitTorrent, Inc. {{with the intention of}} shaping traffic in a protocol-agnostic manner. Questions about the ethics and legality of Comcast's behavior have led to renewed debate about net neutrality in the United States. In general, although encryption can make it difficult to determine what is being shared, BitTorrent is vulnerable to traffic analysis. Thus, even with MSE/PE, it may be possible for an ISP to recognize BitTorrent and also to determine that a system is no longer downloading but only uploading data, and terminate its connection by injecting TCP RST (<b>reset</b> flag) <b>packets.</b>|$|R

40|$|Several {{off-the-shelf}} products enable {{network operators}} to enforce usage restrictions by actively terminating connections when deemed undesirable. While {{the spectrum of}} their application is large—from ISPs limiting the usage of P 2 P applications to the “Great Firewall of China”—many of these systems implement the same approach to disrupt the communication: they inject artificial TCP <b>Reset</b> (RST) <b>packets</b> into the network, causing the endpoints to shut down communication upon receipt. In this work, we study the characteristics of packets injected by such traffic control devices. We show that by exploiting the race-conditions that out-of-band devices inevitably face, we not only can detect the interference but often also fingerprint the specific device in use. We develop an efficient injection detector and demonstrate its effectiveness by identifying a range of disruptive activity seen in traces from four different sites, including termination of P 2 P connections, anti-spam and anti-virus mechanisms, and the finding that China’s “Great Firewall ” has multiple components, sometimes apparently operating without coordination. We also find {{a number of sources}} of idiosyncratic connection termination that do not reflect third-party traffic disruption, including NATs, loadbalancers, and spam bots. In general, our findings highlight that (i) Internet traffic faces a wide range of control devices using injected RST packets, and (ii) to reliably detect RST injection while avoiding misidentification of other types of activity requires significant care. ...|$|R

In Second-Order (SO) state, the compressor is suppressing all dynamic fields such as RTP sequence numbers, and sending only a logical sequence number and partial checksum to cause the other side to predictively generate and verify the headers of the next expected packet. In general, FO state compresses all static fields and most dynamic fields. SO state is compressing all dynamic fields predictively using a sequence number and checksum.|$|R
30|$|At {{the start}} of the {{calculations}} of the S-WPIA, data from the specified particle instruments are transferred to the SDRAM from each instrument’s assigned partition on the MDR. The sizes of the particle buffers in the SDRAM are decided based on the assigned network bandwidth of each particle instrument. A packet of particle data commonly consists of a TI packet, event packet, and counter-event packet. The TI packet is produced each time the S-WPIA clock counter is <b>reset.</b> The event <b>packet</b> is produced every time a single particle is detected and includes information on the S-WPIA clock counter at the time of particle detection, such as the energy and arrival direction of a particle. The counter-event packet is produced every 250 ms and includes the number of particle detections that are not transferred to the MDR, due to high particle count rates. The S-WPIA identifies the observation time of each particle using both TI and the S-WPIA clock counter that is included in the event packet. Furthermore, the correction of the known time delay between each sensor and its electronic circuit is considered. Each instrument has a quality flag in the event packet. The S-WPIA ignores the event packet when the quality flag shows bad-quality data.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—It {{has been}} {{observed}} that transient failures are fairly common in IP backbone networks {{and there have been}} several proposals based on local rerouting to provide high network availability despite failures. While most of these proposals are effective in handling single failures, they either cause loops or drop packets in the case of multiple independent failures. To ensure forwarding continuity even with multiple failures, we propose Localized On-demand Link State (LOLS) routing. Under LOLS, each packet carries a blacklist, which is a minimal set of failed links encountered along its path, and the next hop is determined by excluding the blacklisted links. We show that the blacklist can be <b>reset</b> when the <b>packet</b> makes forward progress towards the destination and hence can be encoded in a few bits. Furthermore, blacklist-based forwarding entries at a router can be precomputed for a given set of failures requiring protection. While the LOLS approach is generic, this paper describes how it can be applied to ensure forwarding to all reachable destinations in case of any two link or node failures. Our evaluation of this failure scenario based on various real network topologies reveals that LOLS needs 6 bits in the worst case to convey the blacklist information. We argue that this overhead is acceptable considering that LOLS routing deviates from the optimal path by a small stretch only while routing around failures. I...|$|R
