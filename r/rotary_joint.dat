25|$|Mike Fossum and Ron Garan {{completed}} a six-hour-forty-eight-minute spacewalk at 23:10 UTC. During the excursion, the pair retrieved the Orbiter Boom Sensor System, serviced and inspected {{components of a}} Solar Alpha <b>Rotary</b> <b>Joint</b> and prepared the JEM-PS component of the Kibō laboratory for installation. Karen Nyberg and Akihiko Hoshide, using the station’s robotic arm, removed the JEM-PS from the shuttle’s payload bay and latched it in place on the Harmony node, completing the task at 23:01 UTC.|$|E
25|$|The first spacewalk of the STS-134 {{mission was}} {{completed}} on flight day 5. Drew Feustel and Greg Chamitoff completed {{the installation of}} {{a new set of}} MISSE experiments, and also started installing a new wireless video system, but were stopped when a CO2 sensor failed in Chamitoff's suit. After the failure, the pair were told to install an ammonia jumper between the Port 3 (P3) and Port 6 (P6) truss segments. The spacewalkers furthermore installed a new light on the Crew Equipment Translation Aid (CETA) cart on the Starboard 3 (S3) truss segment, and a cover on the starboard Solar Alpha <b>Rotary</b> <b>Joint</b> (SARJ). The installation of the wireless video system was completed during the third EVA. While the 6-hour-and-19-minute-long spacewalk was in progress, members of the STS-134 crew completed more equipment transfers between Endeavour and the ISS. Expedition 27 crew members also prepared for the departure of Dmitri Kondratyev, Paolo Nespoli and Cady Coleman.|$|E

25|$|Unexpected {{problems}} and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced {{abandonment of the}} station for safety reasons, had these problems not been resolved. During STS-120 in 2007, following the relocation of the P6 truss and solar arrays, it was noted during the redeployment of the array that it had become torn and was not deploying properly. An EVA {{was carried out by}} Scott Parazynski, assisted by Douglas Wheelock. The men took extra precautions {{to reduce the risk of}} electric shock, as the repairs were carried out with the solar array exposed to sunlight. The issues with the array were followed in the same year by problems with the starboard Solar Alpha <b>Rotary</b> <b>Joint</b> (SARJ), which rotates the arrays on the starboard side of the station. Excessive vibration and high-current spikes in the array drive motor were noted, resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard SARJ until the cause was understood. Inspections during EVAs on STS-120 and STS-123 showed extensive contamination from metallic shavings and debris in the large drive gear and confirmed damage to the large metallic race ring at the heart of the joint, and so the joint was locked to prevent further damage. Repairs to the joint were carried out during STS-126 with lubrication of both joints and the replacement of 11 out of 12 trundle bearings on the joint.|$|E
2500|$|On December 18, 2007, {{during the}} fourth spacewalk of Expedition 16 to inspect the S4 {{starboard}} Solar Alpha <b>Rotary</b> <b>Joint</b> (SARJ), the ground team in Mission Control informed Whitson that she had become the female astronaut with the most cumulative EVA time in NASA history, {{as well as the}} most EVAs, with her fifth EVA. Three hours and 37 minutes into the spacewalk, Whitson surpassed NASA astronaut Sunita Williams with a total time at that point of 29 hours and 18 minutes. At the completion of Whitson's fifth EVA, the 100th in support of ISS assembly and maintenance, Whitson's cumulative EVA time became 32 hours, and 36 minutes, which placed her in 20th place for total EVA time. [...] Her sixth spacewalk, also during Expedition 16, brought her cumulative EVA time to 39 hours, 46 minutes, which ranked her 23rd for total EVA time as of November 2009.|$|E
2500|$|The second EVA of STS-134 was {{conducted}} on flight day 7 by Drew Feustel and Mike Fincke. The spacewalk, the sixth-longest {{in the history of}} spaceflight thus far, lasted 8 hours and 7 minutes, significantly longer than the planned 6 hours and 30 minutes. The excursion also marked the second-longest spacewalk conducted from the ISS. During the spacewalk, Fincke and Feustel hooked up a jumper to transfer [...] of ammonia to the Port 6 Photovoltaic Thermal Control System (PVTCS), lubricated the Solar Alpha <b>Rotary</b> <b>Joint</b> (SARJ) and one of the [...] "hands" [...] on Dextre, and installed a stowage beam on the Starboard 1 (S1) truss. During the lubrication task on the Port SARJ, some of the bolts on one of the thermal blankets came free, and one was lost. Commander Mark Kelly documented the spacewalk with still and video cameras, while mission specialist Greg Chamitoff assisted Feustel and Fincke. The spacewalk was the seventh for Fincke and the fifth for Feustel. Fincke had conducted his previous six spacewalks in Russian Orlan suits.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide final results of a {{pointing}} stability analysis for external payload attachment sites (PAS) on the International Space Station (ISS). As a specific example, the pointing stability requirement of the SAGE III atmospheric science instrument was examined in this paper. The instrument requires 10 arcsec stability over 2 second periods. SAGE 3 will be mounted on the ISS starboard side at the lower, outboard FIAS. In this engineering analysis, an open-loop DAC- 3 finite element model of ISS was used by the Microgravity Group at Johnson Space Flight Center to generate transient responses at PAS to a limited number of disturbances. The model included dynamics up to 50 Hz. Disturbance models considered included operation of the solar array <b>rotary</b> <b>joints,</b> thermal radiator <b>rotary</b> <b>joints,</b> and control moment gyros. Responses were filtered to model the anticipated vibration attenuation effects of active control systems on the solar and thermal radiator <b>rotary</b> <b>joints.</b> A pointing stability analysis was conducted by double integrating acceleration transient over a 2 second period. Results of the analysis are tabulated for ISS X, Y, and Z Axis rotations. These results indicate that the largest excursions in rotation during pointing occurred due to rapid slewing of the thermal radiator. Even without attenuation at the <b>rotary</b> <b>joints,</b> the resulting pointing error was limited to less than 1. 6 arcsec. With vibration control at the joints, to a maximum 0. 5 arcsec over a 2 second period. Based on this current level of model definition, it was concluded that between 0 - 50 Hz, the pointing stability requirement for SAGE 3 will not be exceeded by the disturbances evaluated in this study...|$|R
50|$|The P3/P4 truss {{assembly}} {{was installed}} by the Space Shuttle Atlantis STS-115 mission, launched September 9, 2006, {{and attached to}} the P1 segment. The P3 and P4 segments together contain a pair of solar arrays, a radiator and a <b>rotary</b> <b>joint</b> that will aim the solar arrays, and connects P3 to P4. Upon its installation, no power was flowing across the <b>rotary</b> <b>joint,</b> so the electricity generated by the P4 solar array wings was only being used on the P4 segment, and not {{the rest of the}} station. Then in December 2006 a major electrical rewiring of the station by STS-116 routed this power to the entire grid. The S3/S4 truss assembly—a mirror-image of P3/P4—was installed on June 11, 2007 also by Space Shuttle Atlantis during flight STS-117, mission 13A and mounted to the S1 truss segment.|$|E

50|$|The Alpha joint is {{the main}} <b>rotary</b> <b>joint</b> {{allowing}} the solar arrays to track the sun; in nominal operation the alpha joint rotates by 360° each orbit (however, see also Night Glider mode). One Solar Alpha <b>Rotary</b> <b>Joint</b> (SARJ) is located between the P3 and P4 truss segments {{and the other is}} located between the S3 and S4 truss segments. When in operation, these joints continuously rotate to keep the solar array wings on the outboard truss segments oriented towards the Sun. Each SARJ is 10 feet in diameter, weighs approximately 2,500 pounds and can be rotated continuously using bearing assemblies and a servo control system. On both the port and starboard sides, all of the power flows through the Utility Transfer Assembly (UTA) in the SARJ. Roll ring assemblies allow transmission of data and power across the rotating interface so it never has to unwind. The SARJ was designed, built and tested by Lockheed Martin and its subcontractors.|$|E

40|$|In September 2007, the {{excessive}} vibrations {{played a significant}} role in the station operation since one of the <b>rotary</b> <b>joints,</b> which provides the station electrical energy, presented an anomaly.

To avoid a new anomaly, the inspection of the <b>rotary</b> <b>joints</b> performance continues by using the accelerometers data. This thesis presents three new approaches to monitor the vibrations at the International Space Station based on Root-Mean-Square, kurtosis, and Approximate Entropy (ApEn). MATLAB functions and codes were necessary to implement the three monitoring techniques results from the provided accelerometer datasets. The analyses consist in detecting the datasets with considerable vibrations and perform plots of the three techniques versus time for those datasets. In the end, the plot results are compared with Power Spectral Densities (PSD) plots. The plots results had shown that the RMS method was able to detect most vibrations, kurtosis was able to detect the two most excessive ones, and ApEn only detected the most excessive one. ...|$|R
