The classification module determines the type of detected road signs using a series of one to one architectural Multi-layer Perceptron neural networks. Two sets of classifiers are trained using the Resillient-Backpropagation and Scaled-Conjugate-Gradient algorithms. The two modules of the system are evaluated individually first.

The main requirement for the <b>road</b> <b>signs</b> <b>recognition</b> system (RSRS) was the ability to process the image data captured by a camera placed in a moving vehicle in a real road environment. This implies robustness against a wide range of disturbances that occur in the real environment, such as lighting conditions, various viewing distances, possible deformations of the <b>road</b> <b>signs,</b> possible partial occlusion of the roas signs, etc. Considering such an environment, the RSRS should be still able to work with a good accuracy.

40|$|Background: Fitness {{to drive}} may be {{compromised}} {{by a variety}} of medical conditions, including stroke. Driving may legally be resumed 1 month after stroke if clinical recovery is deemed satisfactory. Advice available for patients and medical practitioners is unclear and inconsistent as to whether return to driving is influenced by aphasia. Information on the opinions of medical practitioners and aphasia therapists regarding resumption of driving with aphasia, the return to driving experience of people with aphasia, and their <b>road</b> <b>sign</b> <b>recognition</b> ability, has been largely anecdotal. Aims: (1) To determine the views and practice of medical practitioners and aphasia therapists on return to driving with aphasia caused by stroke and the experience and effects for aphasic people of resuming or not resuming driving. (2) To assess the <b>road</b> <b>sign</b> <b>recognition</b> ability of aphasic people who had returned to driving or wished to do so in relation to a comparable non-stroke population. Methods and Procedures: People with aphasia following stroke (n = 18) who had returned to driving or wished to do so, medical practitioners (n = 11), and aphasia therapists (n = 18) were interviewed to determine the patient experience and medical practitioners' and therapists' views on driving with aphasia. <b>Road</b> <b>sign</b> <b>recognition</b> was assessed in the aphasic and a matched non-brain-damaged control group (n = 18). Outcome and Results : The majority of medical practitioners and aphasia therapists thought that in some cases driving with aphasia was contra-indicated.

The aphasic group was significantly less proficient than the control group in <b>road</b> <b>sign</b> <b>recognition</b> and in understanding written and spoken road sign descriptions.

Color based segmentation techniques are employed for traffic sign detection. The coordinates position of traffic sign in images used for shape classification are obtained by orthogonal projection. An algorithm based on Hough transform was proposed to achieve better shape classification performance. <b>Recognition</b> of traffic <b>signs</b> are implemented using binary tree multi- classifer SVM with geometry semantic feature as the feature vector...|$|R
