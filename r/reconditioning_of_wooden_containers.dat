It is of animal origin, {{and is also}} known as butyrellite. Until 2003 {{scientists}} and archaeologists were not quite sure of the origin of bog butter. Scientists working at the University of Bristol discovered that some samples of the [...] "butter" [...] were of adipose/tallow origin while others were of dairy origin.|$|R

To the northwest, a <b>wooden</b> chamber <b>of</b> 2 x 1 m contained an inhumation, and to the southeast, a cremation burial had been placed in some kind <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>container.</b> Cremations are more commonly associated with the Halstatt phase, inhumation with the La Tène one.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the {{incredible}} discovery <b>of</b> various <b>wooden</b> objects found during the excavations at the ancient Fábrica de Tabacos in Gijón {{that took place}} between 2007 and 2009. The objects were thrown into the water tank {{during the time of}} abandonment, dated from early 6 th century ad. Among these were pieces <b>of</b> crockery, <b>wooden</b> <b>containers,</b> buckets, a chair and other objects such as well lintel. This study allows us to determine the function of unique pieces and the dating of each of the materials appeared by the radiocarbon method dating back to the early 6 th century ad until the 10 th century. This was an unusual undertaking for the Iberian Peninsula that succeeded thanks to the climate conditions of the region where the objects were found –such as the low ground water level– all of which allowed for an extraordinary preservation of these objects. </p...|$|R

50|$|The 19th {{century was}} the {{pinnacle}} of Cooperage technology, the regulation of cask size and production had a streamlining effect on maritime trade and industry. The cask design was paramount to trade for two reasons; the ability to uniformly apply packing techniques to merchant vessels, and the efficiency of inspecting and calculating materials contained within stowed casks. At {{this time in the}} mid 19th century, cask had become a generic term for any type <b>of</b> <b>wooden</b> staved <b>container,</b> and could vary in both size and purpose. For example, cask sizes ranged from a 9-gallon keg to a 252-gallon tun and were designed in three ways depending on the properties of the goods being stored. The manifests of William Salthouse state there were at least 1000 casks of varying size stowed on board when the vessel foundered at Port Phillip Bay in 1841. The high concentration of casks in a single location provided an opportunity to gain information about 19th century cooperage technology, cask marking traditions, cask contents, and stowage methods in a merchant sailing vessel.|$|R

40|$|Under {{the auspices}} of an {{agreement}} between the U. S. and the United Kingdom, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) {{has an opportunity to}} transfer approximately 710, 000 kilograms (1, 562, 000 pounds) of unneeded normal and low-enriched uranium (LEU) to the United Kingdom; thus, reducing long-term surveillance and maintenance burdens at the Hanford Site. The material, in the form of billets, is controlled by DOE`s Defense Programs, and is presently stored as surplus material in the 300 Area of the Hanford Site. The United Kingdom has expressed a need for the billets. The surplus uranium billets are currently stored in <b>wooden</b> shipping <b>containers</b> in secured facilities in the 300 Area at the Hanford Site (the 303 -B and 303 -G storage facilities). There are 482 billets at an enrichment level (based on uranium- 235 content) of 0. 71 weight-percent. This enrichment level is normal uranium; that is, uranium having 0. 711 as the percentage by weight of uranium- 235 as occurring in nature. There are 3, 242 billets at an enrichment level of 0. 95 weight-percent (i. e., low-enriched uranium). This inventory represents a total of approximately 532 curies. The facilities are routinely monitored. The dose rate on contact of a uranium billet is approximately 8 millirem per hour. The dose rate on contact <b>of</b> a <b>wooden</b> shipping <b>container</b> containing 4 billets is approximately 4 millirem per hour. The dose rate at the exterior of the storage facilities is indistinguishable from background levels...|$|R
