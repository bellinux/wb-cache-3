5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), resource intensity, and <b>resource</b> <b>productivity</b> are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are food, energy, materials and water.|$|E

50|$|<b>Resource</b> <b>productivity</b> and {{resource}} intensity are key concepts used in sustainability measurement {{as they attempt}} to decouple the direct connection between resource use and environmental degradation. Their strength is that they {{can be used as a}} metric for both economic and environmental cost. Although these concepts are two sides of the same coin, in practice they involve very different approaches and can be viewed as reflecting, on the one hand, the efficiency of resource production as outcome per unit of resource use (<b>resource</b> <b>productivity)</b> and, on the other hand, the efficiency of resource consumption as resource use per unit outcome (resource intensity). The sustainability objective is to maximize <b>resource</b> <b>productivity</b> while minimizing resource intensity.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was {{performed}} to explore the components and dimensions of Islamic values affecting the <b>productivity</b> of human <b>resources</b> {{from the perspective of}} Mashhad Municipality employees using a hybrid method. For this purpose, in-depth interviews were performed with 20 administrative and scientific experts of Mashhad Municipality using content analysis. The results obtained from semi-structured interviews were classified into the dimensions of non-promotion of religious and revolutionary values, not spending enough on culture-building, approving the wrongdoer in the system, lack of suitable role model and creating substrates for anti-values as the factors affecting Islamic values; each of these behaviors consist of other concepts. The dimensions along with the components of Islamic values questionnaire including piety, tolerance and trust were examined in a sample of 215 employees in 13 Mashhad Municipality zones. In fact, {{the findings of this study}} expand the area in the field of organizational studies by providing dimensions and components of human <b>resources</b> <b>productivity</b> from the employees’ perspectives and increase human <b>resources</b> <b>productivity</b> in organizations.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} soil fertility maintenance in relation to crop yield and farm income growth in general in the west African semi-arid tropics. It describes the structural and the input-output characteristics of food crop production and soil fertility management inside a typical village of southern Upper-Volta and then proceeds to infer from cross-section variations the relationships among the existing soil fertility management practices, soil fertility, crop yields, farm income, <b>resource</b> <b>productivities</b> and the average intensity of land utilization. These inferences are used to identify the technical changes {{as well as the}} input and output substitutions that characterize the adjustment mechanism of the cropping system vis-a-vis land use intensification. The technical, social and economic factors that explain and constrain the maintenance and the improvement of soil fertility and thereby limit the growth and the development of the cropping system are pointed out together with the types of agricultural research orientations and rural development policy actions that are most needed to effectively and efficiently relax the major constraints. The cropping system {{has been shown to be}} composed of five soil-crop management rings, with varying intensities of land utilization, that conceptually surround the household's habitat. Physical measures of soil fertility suggested that the cropping system more or less maintains or improves the chemical fertility of soils on upland but fails to do so on lowland. However, on upland and over the long term, an intensification of cultivation may have some adverse effects on the physical status of the soil and lead to a decline in field capacity. Statistical measures of yields, farm income and <b>resource</b> <b>productivities</b> following the intensity of land use scale suggested than an increase in the intensity of land utilization caused by an increasing demand for arable lands has no adverse effect on crop yields, farm income and <b>resource</b> <b>productivities.</b> This is made possible by the adjustment mechanism of the cropping system vis-a-vis land use intensification. The main feature of the adjustment process is besides out-migration, a substitution of red sorghum for millet and white sorghum, accompanied by a substitution of mineral and organic fertilizers for fallow...|$|R
