500|$|Soon {{the valley}} {{was a popular}} winter destination. Other {{facilities}} started off as private getaways but were later opened to the public.

This large ranch home built in the Spanish Revival style became a hotel in the late 1930s and, {{largely because of the}} fame of Death Valley Scotty, a tourist attraction. Death Valley Scotty, whose real name was Walter Scott, was a gold miner who pretended to be owner of [...] "his castle", which he claimed to have built with profits from his gold mine. Neither claim was true, but the <b>real</b> <b>owner,</b> Chicago millionaire Albert Mussey Johnson, encouraged the myth.

500|$|Cox often filed {{fraudulent}} mortgage documents, and {{in several}} cases was able to mortgage properties for five to six times their actual worth. In this practice, known as [...] "shotgunning" [...] {{in the real estate}} community, Cox either himself forged or had accomplices attain inflated appraisals to increase the value of the mortgages. One of his accomplices was a detention officer, who acquired 14 properties worth nearly $600,000, while making $35,568 a year in his job. Cox took advantage of the Hillsborough County school district by selling it a property for much more than its appraised value, and arranged financing on a $90,000 house for future Florida Representative Janet Cruz. He recorded that sale for $233,000, and hired Cruz to do some rezoning research. Cruz claims she was unaware he inflated the sale price, and that she was never paid for her research. When a female accomplice rented a house in Pinellas County as part of Cox's schemes, then faked ownership of the property, the owner found out about the fraud. A title company manager had become suspicious of a loan Cox's accomplice was applying for on the house and called the property's <b>real</b> <b>owner.</b> The Clearwater Police department was contacted, and they began an investigation.|$|E

40|$|The {{situation}} {{that one can}} discern on the Swedish real estate market is that while there are several offices vacant, the need for apartments is high – the vacancy rate for apartments is non-existent. According to the rebuilding of Skatteskrapan one will realise that the project {{requires a lot of}} money, even though it promotes the residential situation. The <b>real</b> estate <b>owner</b> experiences a risk in rebuilding real estates – whether it will generate good yield or not. This results in a great need to construct a solid basis of decision before a rebuilding is made. Our purpose is to analyse the basis of decision that is constructed before a rebuilding from offices to apartments that takes place in Stockholm. Within the basis of decision that is constructed before a rebuilding from office to apartment, we intend to examine the process that <b>real</b> estate <b>owner</b> experiences before a rebuilding is possible. The result we received from the examination shows that all of the <b>real</b> estate <b>owners</b> calculate on expected revenues and costs. Furthermore, we discovered that almost every <b>real</b> estate <b>owner</b> didn’t construct a thorough marketing analysis. The yield of demand differs between the private <b>real</b> estate <b>owners</b> and those run by the state. Concerning laws and restrictions, it’s something <b>real</b> estate <b>owners</b> must subordinate and take into consideration. Our conclusion is that there are several elements that could change or improve – which moreover could increase the number of rebuilds from offices to apartments – which are noiserestriction, the handling process with complaints and so forth...|$|R

2500|$|Statements of {{equitable}} principle stretch {{back to the}} Ancient Greeks in {{the work}} of Aristotle, while examples of rules analogous to trusts were found in the Roman law testamentary institution of the fideicommissum, and the Islamic proprietary institution of the Waqf. [...] However, English trusts law is a largely indigenous development that began in the Middle Ages, {{from the time of the}} 11th and 12th century crusades. After William the Conqueror became King in 1066, one [...] "common law" [...] of England was created. Common law courts regarded property as an indivisible entity, as it had been under Roman law and continental versions of civil law. During the crusades, landowners who went to fight would transfer title to their land to a person they trusted so that feudal services could be performed and received. But many who returned found that the people they entrusted refused to transfer their title deed back. Sometimes, common law courts would not acknowledge that anybody had rights in the property except the holder of the legal title deeds. So claimants petitioned the King to sidestep the common law courts. The King delegated hearing of petitions to his Lord Chancellor, who established the Court of Chancery as more cases were heard. Where it appeared [...] "inequitable" [...] (i.e. unfair) to let someone with legal title hold onto land, the Lord Chancellor could declare that the <b>real</b> <b>owner</b> [...] "in equity" [...] (i.e. in all fairness) was another person, if this is what good conscience dictated. The Court of Chancery determined that the true [...] "use" [...] or [...] "benefit" [...] of property did not belong to the person on the title (or the feoffee who held seisin). The cestui que use, the owner in equity, could be a different person. So English law recognised a split between legal and equitable owner, between someone who controlled title and another for whose benefit the land would be used. It was the beginning of trust law. The same logic was useful for Franciscan friars, who would transfer title of land to others as they were precluded from holding property by their vows of poverty. When the courts said that one person's legal title to property was subject to an obligation to use that property for another person, there was a trust.|$|E
