5000|$|Carla Lavatelli's sculptures {{reside in}} many {{prominent}} museum and private collections across the United States and Europe, {{as well as}} in public and communal spaces and university campuses. Notable examples include her first abstract work, Ginko Biloba (1971), carved from <b>red</b> <b>Persian</b> travertine, which is located in the Phillips Collection in Washington DC. The work had been gifted to the Phillips by Lavatelli in 1974,on the occasion of her exhibition there the same year. Other important works include Stele For a Prayer (1971), a monolithic work in white Carrara marble and slate in the collectin of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Her carved stone and silver jewelry, which she called [...] "Sculptures to Wear" [...] are {{in the collection of the}} Minneapolis Institute of Arts.Several versions of Lavatelli's large-scale abstract sculpture in bronze and stainless steel, 1 ½ (1969-70), are in the museum collections of American universities, including Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA and Brown University in Providence, RI. Originally installed on the Stanford campus in front of the law school, the sculpture was restored in 1996 by Lavatelli and relocated to Fairchild Chapel. At Brown, 1 ½ has been on view in front of the brutalist high-rise Science Library building since it was installed there in 1975. Bill Van Siclen, an arts writer for the Providence Journal, remarked in a 2007 article that Lavatelli’s 1 ½ resembled a “giant chrome-plated engine part,” and that “had she not become a sculptor, the Italian-born Lavatelli clearly had a future as a sports car designer.”In 1978, Lavatelli was commissioned to install a spherical bronze sculpture in a newly created pond at the Botanical Gardens in Freiburg, Germany, which she titled Golden Pond, and which is still on view. During the 1990s, she presented several temporary and permanent site-specific installations, including [...] "happenings" [...] involving paper and reed sculptures in Pistoia, Italy and New York City. In 1995, the town of Mougins, France commissioned her to create a stone bench installation with a fountain set into a rough-hewn travertine for the plaza of the Place du Banc des Amis off the Rue d'Eglisse. [...] She was presented with the town's honorary Gold Medal upon its unveiling in 1995.|$|E

5000|$|The caracal {{is placed}} in the family Felidae and {{subfamily}} Felinae. The species was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber as Felis caracal in the journal Die Säugetiere in Abbildungen nach der Natur mit Beschreibungen in 1776. In 1843, British zoologist John Edward Gray placed the animal in the genus Caracal. The name [...] "caracal" [...] is composed of two Turkish words: kara, meaning black, and kulak, meaning ear. The first recorded use of this name dates back to 1760. Alternative names for the caracal include gazelle cat, red cat, rooikat, and <b>red</b> or <b>Persian</b> lynx.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s a {{spontaneous}} mutation {{in red and}} <b>red</b> tabby <b>Persians</b> {{gave rise to the}} [...] "peke-faced" [...] Persian, named after the flat-faced Pekingese dog. It was registered as a distinct breed in the CFA, but fell out of favor by the mid-1990s due to serious health issues; only 98 were registered between 1958 and 1995. Despite this, breeders took a liking to the look and started breeding towards the peke-face look. The over-accentuation of the breed's characteristics by selective breeding (called extreme- or ultra-typing) produced results similar to the peke-faced Persians. The term peke-face has been used to refer to the ultra-typed Persian but it is properly used only to refer to red and <b>red</b> tabby <b>Persians</b> bearing the mutation. Many fanciers and CFA judges considered the shift in look [...] "a contribution to the breed."In 1958, breeder and author P. M. Soderberg wrote in Pedigree Cats, Their Varieties, breeding and Exhibition"Perhaps in recent times there has been a tendency to over-accentuate this type of short face, with the result that a few of the cats seen at shows have faces which present a peke-like appearance. This is a type of face which is definitely recognized in the United States, and helps to form a special group within the show classification for the Persian breed. There are certainly disadvantages when the face has become too short, for this exaggeration of type is inclined to produce a deformity of the tear ducts, and running eyes may be the result. A cat with running eyes will never look at its best because in time the fur {{on each side of the}} nose becomes stained, and thus detracts from the general appearance ... The nose should be short, but perhaps a plea may be made here that the nose is better if it is not too short and at the same time uptilted. A nose of this type creates an impression of grotesqueness which is not really attractive, and there is always a danger of running eyes." ...|$|R

50|$|While the {{southern}} {{slopes of the}} Alborz Mountains are usually semiarid or arid with irregular and low precipitation, the northern slopes of the range are usually humid especially in the western parts of the Central Alborz. In {{the southern}} slopes or the Elburz Range forest steppe ecoregion, the higher elevations are arid with few trees. Juniper {{is the most common}} tree in the inaccessible areas and high elevations, while shrubs are pistachio, maple, and almond. But in the northern slopes, the Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests ecoregion is lush and forested. The natural vegetation of this region grows in distinct zones: the Hyrcanian forests on the lowest levels; beech forests in the middle zone; and oak forests in higher regions. The wild cypress is the dominant form of vegetation in some valleys, while olive trees grow in the western valleys of the Central Alborz near the Sefidrud.

Six legumes (white clover [Trifolium repens L. ], red clover [Trifolium pratense L. ], Persian clover [Trifolium resupinatum L. ], black medic [Medi-cago lupulina L. ], kidney vetch [Anthyllis vulneraria L. ], and lupin [Lupinus angustifolius L. ]), four non legumes (rye grass [Lolium perenne L. ], chicory [Cichorium intybus L. ], fodder radish [Raphanus sativus L. ],and sorrel [Rumex Acetósa L. ]), and one mixture (rye/hairy vetch [Secale cereale L. /Vicia villosa L. ]) were tested in a field experiment with three repli-cates in a randomized block design. Four reference treat-ments without catch crops and with N application (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg Nha– 1) to a succeeding spring barley were included in the design. Due to their ability to fix N 2, the legume catch crops had a significantly larger abovegrounddry-matter production and N content in the autumn than the non legumes. The autumn N uptake of the nonlegumes was 10 – 13 kg Nha– 1 in shoots and approx. 9 kg ha– 1 in the roots. The shoot N content of white clover, black medic, <b>red</b> clover, <b>Persian</b> clover, and kidney vetch was 55 – 67 kg ha– 1, and the root N content in white clover and kidney vetch was approx. 25 kg ha– 1. The legume catch crops, especially white and red clover, seemed to be valuable N sources for grain production on this soil type and their N fertilizer-replacement values in a following unfertilized spring barley corresponded to 120 and 103 kg Nha– 1, respectively. The N fertilizer–replacement values exceeded the N content of shoots and roots...|$|R
40|$|Root {{diseases}} {{caused by}} soil-borne pathogens are often main constraints in legume crop production. Changes towards organic farming practices have recently {{contributed to an}} increase in legume cropping, mainly for nitrogen supply purposes, and these have raised concerns about unacceptable build-up of soil-borne pathogen inocula. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of frequent legume cropping on such inocula build-up, and had emphasis on Aphanomyces euteiches, an important pathogen causing pea root rot in Sweden. Field experiments with legume monocultures were established, and the effect of these monocultures on disease development and yields in subsequent pea, broad bean and snap bean was measured. Isolates of Aphanomyces spp., from several legumes, were tested for host ranges and characterised by means of morphological, biochemical and molecular methods. A survey of legume-specific soil-borne pathogens in fields under frequent legume cropping in northern Spain was also undertaken. Several legumes were found to be hosts for A. euteiches, and this pathogen was isolated from field-grown alfalfa, snap bean, pea, sweet clover and vetch. The Swedish isolates of A. euteiches were assigned two putative pathotypes, pea- and vetch-specific. Other species of Aphanomyces had a wide host range among legumes, but these did not induce disease symptoms. Sequencing of ITS 1 - 5. 8 S - ITS 2 rDNA region and RFLP of AT-rich DNA allowed appropriate delineation of these Aphanomyces spp. Monocultures of the tested legume crops affected the inoculum potential of A. euteiches differently. Pea, broad bean, snap bean, vetch and sweet clover were almost equally efficient in inoculum build-up and markedly affected subsequent pea and broad bean yields. Monocultures of alfalfa, birdsfoot trefoil, <b>red,</b> white, and <b>Persian</b> clover had lower impact on disease development and yields in subsequent crops. Thielaviopsis basicola and Rhizoctonia solani were the most prevalent pathogens in pea and snap bean fields in Spain and significantly affected yield. Climatic factors and soil properties favoured prevalence of these pathogens in Spain, whereas A. euteiches was most prevalent under Swedish conditions. It is concluded that intensive legume cropping will, on many soil types not be sustainable in the long-term due to the build-up of soil-borne pathogen inoculum...|$|R
