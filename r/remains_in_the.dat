5|$|Improbably, the {{excavators}} {{found the}} <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first location {{in which they}} dug at the car park. Coincidentally, they lay almost directly under a roughly painted 'R' on the tarmac. This had existed since the early 2000s to signify a reserved parking space.|$|E

5|$|A {{man from}} Glastonbury {{is engaged to}} a girl from Wookey. A witch living in Wookey Hole Caves curses the romance so that it fails. The man, now a monk, seeks revenge on this witch who—having been jilted herself—frequently spoils budding relationships. The monk stalks the witch into the cave and she hides in a dark corner {{near one of the}} {{underground}} rivers. The monk blesses the water and splashes some of it at the dark parts of the cave where the witch was hiding. The blessed water immediately petrifies the witch, and she <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cave to this day.|$|E

5|$|About 50–80% of {{salicylate}} in {{the blood}} is bound to albumin protein, while the rest <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 L/kg. Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.|$|E
5|$|Aqua reappears as {{the main}} playable {{character}} of Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep - A Fragmentary Passage, {{which is part of}} Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue that heavily expands on her time in the Realm of Darkness. In the chapter, she encounters Mickey Mouse, who attempts to help her escape, but she ultimately sacrifices herself once again to protect Riku from the Heartless just after Sora's climactic battle with Ansem, and so <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Realm of Darkness.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the former}} casino {{building}} was completed, in 1908, Agustín Ross Edwards and Evaristo Merino reported to historiographer José Toribio Medina {{the existence of}} indigenous <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cave now called the Gruta de la Virgen. Medina asked Argentinean ethnographer Félix Faustino Outes to inspect the remains, and subsequently Medina wrote the book Los Restos Indígenas de Pichilemu (The Indigenous Remains of Pichilemu), using the report Faustino Outes gave him.|$|E

5|$|Despite being a {{depiction}} of an occult ritual, a violent death, a near-nude woman and strongly implied sexual torture, Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was uncontroversial {{on its first}} exhibition in 1833 and was critically well received. Sold by Etty to a private collector in 1833, it passed through the hands of several more before entering {{the collection of the}} Lady Lever Art Gallery. In 1958 it was acquired by the Tate Gallery, and it <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collection of Tate Britain.|$|E
5|$|English Heritage {{took over}} control of the castle in 1983 and {{continued}} to operate it as a tourist attraction. In the 21st century the castle is protected by UK law as an ancient monument and a grade I listed building. It <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> custody of English Heritage, but since 1998 has been managed by its owner, Baron Howard of Rising.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{this design}} would prove too {{advanced}} and expensive for Reynolds. He instead devised an alternate {{design of the}} Reynolds Building, {{which was published in}} August 1928. The new design was much more conservative, with an Italianate dome that a critic compared to Governor Al Smith's bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on the upper floors that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current Chrysler Building. This design almost exactly reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout of the windows of the current building, but with a different dome.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{that during the}} Iron Age people farmed the fields and mined the iron-rich rocks in the Tunbridge Wells area, and excavations in 1940 and 1957–61 by James Money at High Rocks uncovered {{the remains of a}} defensive hill-fort. It is thought that the site was occupied into the era of Roman Britain, and the area continued {{to be part of the}} Wealden iron industry until its demise in the late eighteenth century. An iron forge <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grounds of Bayham Abbey, in use until 1575 and documented until 1714.|$|E
5|$|He {{has never}} been charged with any crime due to {{apparent}} mental inculpability. One contentious issue of Weston's incarceration is that of forced medication. Weston has thus far refused to take any medications voluntarily. His lawyers helped enable this, {{in order to protect}} him from the death penalty. In May 2001, a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily. A panel from a federal appeals court ruled in July 2001 that Weston could be forced to take the drugs which he was forced to do for 120 days. He <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Butner facility indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Ivanović offered four of her {{paintings}} to the Gallery of Historical Portraits, {{the nucleus of}} what was later to become the National Museum of Serbia.

5|$|Increased Sabbat {{activity}} {{coincides with}} {{the disappearance of the}} Malkavian chief, Alistair Grout. At Grout's mansion, the fledgling sees Nines leaving and discovers Grout's <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mansion with vampire hunter Grunfeld Bach, who denies involvement in Grout's death. Learning about Nines' presence at the mansion, LaCroix tells the other chiefs to approve Nines' execution. The fledgling is sent to the Museum of Natural History to recover the sarcophagus, but finds that it has been stolen. Jack later suggests to the fledgling that LaCroix wants the sarcophagus to drink the blood of the ancient within, gaining its power.|$|E
5|$|Little of {{the early}} stained glass <b>remains.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> west window of St John's Chapel, for instance, the medieval glass barely survived the {{destruction}} (said to {{have been caused by}} Oliver Cromwell's men). Most of the higher portions went untouched, but others were severely damaged. In some cases the windows were impossible to repair, and clear glass was eventually introduced to replace the missing scenes. The Victorian stained-glass windows were created by some of the finest studios of that period.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the sites}} {{are located in the}} Highlands and Islands. This may be because of the {{relatively}} sparse modern populations and consequent lack of disturbance. Much of the area also has a thick covering of peat that preserves stone fragments, although the associated acidic conditions tend to dissolve organic materials. There are also numerous important <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Orkney archipelago, where sand and arable land predominate. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures that may have helped to preserve their integrity.|$|E

5|$|Outside Bristol, VT17 and VT116 {{are joined}} by the New Haven River, here marking the {{northern}} boundary of the Green Mountain National Forest. The roadway and waterway head east, following a winding route through the Green Mountains. When New Haven splits off to the southeast shortly afterward, VT17 and VT116 continue north along Baldwin Creek {{up to the point}} where VT17 and VT116 diverge. While VT116 continues north along Beaver Brook, VT17 <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of Baldwin Creek as it heads northeast through the Green Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Records of otters preying upon beavers (Castor canadensis) vary; it {{has been}} {{reported}} in the southern boreal forest of Manitoba. Trappers in Alberta, Canada commonly assert otters are major predators of beavers. A 1994 river otter study reported findings of beaver remains in 27 of 1,191 scats analyzed. However, many other studies did not report any findings of beaver <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scat sampled.|$|E
5|$|Sale's {{urban growth}} {{resulted}} in a merger with neighbouring Ashton upon Mersey, following the Local Government Act 1929. The increase in population led to the granting of a charter in 1935, giving Sale honorific borough status. Since then, Sale has continued to thrive as a commuter town, supported by its proximity to the M60 motorway and the Manchester Metrolink network. Sale Water Park contains an artificial lake used for water sports. Sale FC and Sale Sharks rugby union clubs and Sale Harriers athletics club were founded in Sale, although only the first now <b>remains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town at their Heywood Road ground.|$|E
