Velocity measurements performed on the UCC test rig at the Air Force Institute of Technology revealed flow patterns and time-averaged turbulence statistics for data taken burning hydrogen fuel in a straight and a curved cavity vane configuration. Over an equivalence ratio from 0. 7 to 1. 5, the straight vane configuration showed spanwise velocity decreased linearly with distance from the cavity vane over {{the width of the}} main channel. Increasing the flow rates and holding the equivalence ratio and ratio of cavity to main airflow rates constant, flow velocities in the main channel showed an increase with the curved circumferential configuration but a decrease with the straight circumferential configuration. Turbulence intensity {{is expected to be a}} major contributing factor, specifically since measured at 15 % and 21 % in the main channel for the straight and curved configurations, respectively. The results also show how the <b>radial</b> <b>vane</b> cavity (RVC) created strong vorticity throughout the main flow supporting a recirculation zone for mixing.

Squeeze film dampers, pinched diffusers, and other technologies created a robust design that proved highly tolerant of extreme process upsets as well as normal demands. Impeller tip speed limits help control erosion and an open-faced, <b>radial</b> <b>vane</b> impeller minimizes fouling. Custom five-axis milled Inconel 625 impellers with splitter vanes and pinched diffusers allowed adaptation of a standard compressor frame to meet thermodynamic needs without excess flow.

The compressor was test run four hours with a shaking force two and one half times rotor weight while running below vibration and bearing temperature interlocks.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the nature of}} fan outlet guide vane pressure fluctuations and their link to rotor-stator interaction noise, time histories of vane fluctuating pressures were digitally acquired {{as part of the}} Fan Noise Source Diagnostic Test. Vane unsteady pressures were measured at seven fan tip speeds for both a radial and a swept vane configuration. Using time-domain averaging and spectral analysis, the blade passing frequency (BPF) harmonic and broadband contents of the vane pressures were individually analyzed. Significant Sound Pressure Level (SPL) reductions were observed for the swept vane relative to the <b>radial</b> <b>vane</b> for the BPF harmonics of vane pressure, but vane broadband reductions due to sweep turned out to be much smaller especially on an average basis. Cross-correlation analysis was used to establish the level of spatial coherence of broadband pressures between different locations on the vane and integral length scales of pressure fluctuations were estimated from these correlations. Two main results of this work are: (1) the average broadband level on the vane (in dB) increases linearly with the fan tip speed for both the radial and swept vanes, and (2) the broadband pressure distribution on the vane is nearly homogeneous and its integral length scale is a monotonically decreasing function of fan tip speed...|$|E

These factors were Jumped together and termed the 'friction coefficient'. The tangential particle velocity at the discharge point was assumed constant, since the particle was assumed in direct contact with the vane until emanation. The radial particle velocity was measured at a distance of 0. 4 m from the disc edge with an optical sensor developed in earlier research. A theoretical analysis was used to obtain equations that allowed determination of the mechanical friction coefficient of individual particles. based on the measured radial velocity and the assumed constant tangential velocity. For experiments, a commercial single disc spreader fitted with a flat disc and straight radial vanes was used.

The fan was designed for a corrected rotor tip speed of 442 m/s (1450 ft/s), and had a powered core, or booster stage, giving the model a nominal bypass ratio of 5. A simulated engine pylon and nozzle bifurcation was contained within the bypass duct. The fan stage consisted of all combinations of 3 possible rotors, and 3 stator vane sets. The 3 rotors were (1) wide chord, (2) forward swept, and (3) shrouded. The 3 stator sets were (1) baseline, moderately swept, (2) swept and leaned, and (3) swept integral vane/frame which incorporated some of the swept and leaned features as well as eliminated the downstream support structure. The baseline configuration {{is considered to be}} the wide chord rotor with the <b>radial</b> <b>vane</b> stator. A flyover Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL) code was used to generate relative EPNL values for the various configurations. The swept and leaned stator showed a 3 EPNdB reduction at lower fan speeds relative to the baseline stator; while the swept integral vane/frame stator showed lowest noise levels at high fan speeds. The baseline, wide chord rotor was typically the quietest of the three rotors. A tone removal study was performed to assess the acoustic benefits of removing the fundamental rotor interaction tone and its harmonics. Reprocessing the acoustic results with the bypass tone removed had the most impact on reducing fan noise at transonic rotor speeds. Removal of the bypass rotor interaction tones (BPF and nBPF) showed up to a 6 EPNdB noise reduction at transonic rotor speeds relative to noise levels for the baseline (wide chord rotor and radial stator; all tones present) configuration...|$|E

The {{first part of this}} work investigated the performance of biodiesel as a fuel in low NOx combustors of the type used in industrial gas turbines. This work included comparison with kerosene and co-firing with natural gas and blends of kerosene/biodiesel. In the second phase of this work an aircraft gas turbine APU with diffusion combustion. This investigated the gaseous and particulate emissions using kerosene as a base fuel for comparison with several second generation biofuels, which covered a range of H/C and showed that emissions were correlated with the H/C. The third phase of the work was concerned with renewable or clean coal derived hydrogen combustion using a low NOx flame stabilizer for industrial power generation applications. For the industrial low NOx combustor work a radial swirler flame stabiliser was used. However, the high boiling point of B 100 made operation in a premixed vane passage fuel injection mode impossible as ignition could not be achieved. The pilot fuel injector in the centre was the only fuel injection location that B 100 would stabilise a flame, due to the central recirculation of burnt gases. A central 8 hole radially outward fuel injector was used as WME (B 100) would not operate with <b>radial</b> <b>vane</b> passage fuel injection that is conventionally used for low NOx radial swirlers with natural gas. In the aero engine phase of the research, nine alternative fuels were tested and compared to conventional JetA 1 fuel at idle and full power.

40|$|An {{important}} part of automobile safety is the braking system. Disc brakes {{have been widely used}} in automobiles for sped retardation for over 30 years. During that time, they have developed from a simple disc to a complex disc with channels, vanes, holes and grooves. The stopping capability of disc brakes is affected by the rate at which heat is dissipated by forced convection and the thermal capacity of the rotor. Catastrophic failure of brake rotors can occur during rapid increases or decreases in rotor temperature where regions of high temperature gradients result in high thermal strains. There is little information in the public domain regarding the relative merits of different disc brake rotor geometries, particularly in terms of airflow patterns, heat transfer rates, and internal thermal gradients. The aim of this research project was to investigate how geometrical variations affect the thermal performance of bi-directional disc brake rotors, particularly for high performance applications. Dynamometer testing showed that respectable increases in braking performance are achievable with relatively simple machining modifications. Tuft and smoke visualization techniques provided a preliminary understanding of the airflow in the passages of three distinct bi-directional rotor designs. Particle Image Velocimetry was used for detailed flow measurements which supported the numerical simulations. Computational Fluid Dynamics was used to predict the airflow and heat transfer associated with eight bi-directional brake rotor designs. The results show that 'pillared' passage designs can achieve higher heat transfer rates than traditional straight <b>radial</b> <b>vane</b> designs and that the heat loss from pillared rotors is generally more uniform than from vaned rotors. Subsequent conjugate heat transfer simulations found that temperature gradients inside pillared rotors are typically lower than inside vaned rotors. Thus failure rates due to excessive thermal strain are expected to be lower for pillared rotors. It was shown that rotor selection based solely on heat transfer rates is inappropriate and different passage designs are suited to different applications. The findings of this research will directly benefit local disc brake manufacturers, who do not have resources to conduct thorough studies comparing the thermal characteristics of different brake rotor designs...|$|E

The effects of inlet internal lip shape and diffuser length on sonic inlet performance were also investigated. It was found that the single-passage geometries, in particular a cylindrical centerbody takeoff geometry and a bulb-shaped centerbody approach geometry, provide the highest level of aeroacoustic performance.

In order to reveal the mechanism of large loss and to find a method of improving impeller performances {{in the range of}} Ns< 100 [rpm,m 3 /min, m], seven kinds of centrifugal impellers were tested in a axisymmetric parallel-walled diffuser channel. Three impellers have the same outlet angle of β 2 = 22. 5 with a different Ns from 80 to 200 and the other four have <b>radial</b> <b>vanes</b> (β 2 = 90) ranging from Ns= 50 to 80, three of which are closed type and one is full open type.

The Q 3 D calculation of impeller flow revealed that this discrepancy between the BEP and the designed is mainly due to large separation of flow in an impeller channel. The results also revealed that an efficiency of radial impellers is much higher than that of 22. 5 -impellers of the same Ns in the very low Ns range, though they have unstable performance characteristics.
