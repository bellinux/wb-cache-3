5|$|About {{two hours}} later, it became {{apparent}} that the badly coordinated uprising had failed, as the remaining 550 native soldiers refused to participate in the mutiny, instead helping to quell the rebellion.

5|$|Because {{the storm}} made {{landfall}} in a sparsely populated area, no deaths were <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> NHC.

Flooding from the storm also washed-out portions of two Mexico highways. Furthermore, telephone service was interrupted and power outages occurred. Around 1,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and 100 people were injured. Overall, damage from the system was not widespread.|$|E

Previously classified government documents made public in January 2014 under the UK's 'Thirty Year Rule' reveal that the prime minister was personally aware of the tape and had discussed it with her cabinet.|$|E

In October, Toyota agreed to cover the cost overruns associated with preparing the site for construction.|$|E
