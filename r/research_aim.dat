[...] Much research is focused on evaluating biomolecular sensors, bio-inspired materials and energy, biodiscovery tools, bio-inspired network science, and cognitive neuroscience through the disciplines of cellular and molecular biology, materials science, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and psychology.|$|E

The development aims are to develop teachers {{in order for them}} to use learning opportunities outside the classroom as effectively as possible. In addition, science awareness in the general public will be developed by running events of interest such as ‘Star Parties’, piloting ‘Café Scientifique’ and other activities. Furthermore, the thrust develops teachers’ knowledge in areas that deal with relevant issues of science technology and society such as climate change and biotechnology with the hope that they will impart scientific awareness among their school learners.|$|E

30|$|In {{the current}} study, {{we have three}} {{research}} aims. Our first research question relates to whether individuals with BD have impairments in emotion perception from body movement (or body language). We investigate case-control differences for overall body language reading, for body language reading of specific emotions, and if sex differences are present. We expect that the BD group will perform significantly worse than the HC group, but anticipate no sex differences based on our previous findings using the same test (Vaskinn et al. 2016). In our second <b>research</b> <b>aim,</b> we investigate if {{there are differences between}} participants with BD I and BD II, and if history of psychosis is associated with body language reading performance. Based on the mixed results in the cognitive literature, we make no hypotheses for this <b>research</b> <b>aim.</b> The third <b>research</b> <b>aim</b> is to investigate symptomatic, neurocognitive, and functional correlates of body language reading performance in participants with BD. Participants at our research center are only partly and only mildly symptomatic, and therefore no associations with symptom load are expected. Because cognition {{has been shown to be}} associated with functional outcome in bipolar disorder, we predict significant relations between body language reading and measures of functioning.|$|E
