5|$|Saint Anselm College RECYCLES was a {{greening}} movement {{which started}} on campus in 2009. Up to that time, <b>recycling</b> was limited on campus, and {{students had to}} resort to their own methods of <b>recycling</b> containers and other recyclables in dorms. An impromptu <b>recycling</b> program—Saint Anselm College RECYCLES—was started through the Knights of Columbus and the Club Soccer organization that served the Uppers section of campus, every Saturday, averaging around 650 pounds of material per week. In the 2010 spring semester, this plan funded by Club Soccer and the Knights of Columbus provided over fifty recycle bins, purchased from the city of Providence, Rhode Island. In the spring of 2010, the New Hampshire Institute of Politics installed seven <b>recycling</b> bins throughout its facilities. Inspired by this student-led activity, the college's physical plant purchased 120 bins for all of the apartments in the Uppers, Lowers and Falvey and Collins Houses. In the fall of 2010, Physical Plant installed five Waste Management <b>recycling</b> dumpsters throughout campus. Campus-wide <b>recycling</b> is planned by 2013.|$|E

5|$|The <b>recycling</b> {{facility}} and museum was constructed for {{a cost of}} $5 million and opened in 1993. Funding for the museum was provided through a group of 19 local municipalities, known as the Southwest Connecticut <b>Recycling</b> Committee, which transported recyclables to the facility for processing. The museum {{was part of an}} active <b>recycling</b> operation that allows visitors to follow the recyclable materials through the sorting processes to the crushing and baling process before they are shipped to processors to be recycled into new products.
