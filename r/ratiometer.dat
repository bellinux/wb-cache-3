50|$|Various {{types of}} {{frequency}} meters are used. Many are instruments of the deflection type, ordinarily used for measuring low frequencies but {{capable of being}} used for frequencies as high as 900 Hz. These operate by balancing two opposing forces. Changes in the frequency to be measured cause a change in this balance that can be measured by the deflection of a pointer on a scale. Deflection-type meters are of two types, electrically resonant circuits and <b>ratiometers.</b>|$|R

50|$|A <b>ratiometer</b> systems, however, do {{not require}} hair springs for exerting a {{controlling}} torque,this being provided solely by the appropriate coil winding and non-uniform field arrangements. Should variations occur in the power supply they will affect both coils equally so that the ratio of current flowing in the coils remains the same and tendencies for them to move to positions of differing field strength are counterbalanced.|$|E

40|$|Optical fibers {{transmit}} data when light {{waves are}} propagated through them. Optical fibers have many applications at LLE, {{such as the}} fiber-optic switch module in the ROSS streak camera. 1 It is often necessary to splice two fibers together by a process called fiber-optic fusion splicing. There are two significant sources of optical power loss in a fiber: unoptimized splices and losses contributed by the connectorization of the fiber ends. In {{order to ensure that}} a splice is optimized it is necessary to have an apparatus that will measure just the loss of optical power caused by the splice, account for power fluctuations of the laser used to test the fiber, and do so accurately enough to measure low loss. A <b>ratiometer</b> was constructed that measures only the power loss induced from the splice and can measure losses as low as 0. 5 %. The <b>ratiometer</b> splits the beam into two paths. One path serves as the reference (reference fiber), and the other path contains the fiber being tested (fiber under test). Each fiber has a connector on both ends. Samples of power measurements are made before and after a fusion splice. This sampling process allows the energy loss contribution of the connectors to be eliminated. Using the <b>ratiometer,</b> an amended fusion-splicing program has been shown to reduce the loss in a splice from between 1. 0 dB (20 %) and 2. 6 dB (45 %) to 0. 1 dB (~ 2 %). ...|$|E
40|$|In trace {{water vapor}} direct {{absorption}} spectroscopy, the absorption signal {{is buried in}} noise and up {{and downs of the}} light intensity, an effective signal extraction method is vital. In the basis of double-beam differential absorption, division method in voltage and an approach based on balanced <b>ratiometer</b> detection (BRD) were studied. Voltage division has an excellent stability to temperature variation, mechanical extrusion and fiber bend loss. As to the BRD method, it has an outstanding self-adjusting capability and it can also avoid an excess phase difference caused by current-to-voltage converting circuit, thus this method has a high sensitivity. Furthermore, a so called dual-peak method based on the differential value of two adjacent absorption lines is introduced, the differential value proved has a linear relation with water vapor concentration, and this method provides a way to measure the concentration at high pressure. In addition, the influence of water vapor inside the optical components has been discussed...|$|E
30|$|In {{the field}} of near {{infrared}} H 2 O sensing, the acquisition of the absorption signal usually is from a noisy background, thus {{it is important to}} adopt an effective signal demodulation method. This study introduced the research progress in {{the field of}} trace water vapor detection, covering different individual gas detection techniques. On the basis of the conventional double-beam differential absorption, the division method in voltage and the dual-peak method based on the differential value of two adjacent absorption lines have been studied. Voltage division has an excellent stability to temperature variation, mechanical extrusion, and fiber bend loss. The dual-peak method proved a linear relation with the water vapor concentration, and this method provided a way to measure the concentration at high pressure. Furthermore, the so called balanced <b>ratiometer</b> detection (BRD) was introduced. It has an outstanding self-adjusting capability, and it can also avoid an excess phase difference caused by the current-to-voltage converting circuit, thus this method has a high sensitivity. In addition, the second harmonic technique applied to gas detection was introduced, and for the high-frequency modulation via driving current, 1 /f was suppressed apparently; as a result, this technique realized a better sensitive detection by one to two orders of magnitude.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, we demonstrate, through {{simulation}} and experiment, {{new digital}} signal processing techniques that increase the throughput, and thus the sensitivity, of Cavity Ringdown Spectroscopy (CRDS). Almost all of the experiments in the literature are designed to generate single decay transients, and achieve sensitivity improvements by increasing the reﬂectance of the cavity mirrors. We have designed and built a laser-locked cavity ringdown spectrometer using modest reﬂectance mirrors where the sensitivity is achieved by increasing the data throughput and processing the ringdown data more efficiently. We report {{on the development of}} a Fourier transform based signal processing method for laser-locked Continuous Wave CRDS. Rather than analysing single ringdowns, as is the norm in traditional methods, we analyse the entire waveform output of the locked optical cavity. We have compared our method to Levenburg-Marquardt non linear least squares ﬁtting, and have found that our method has a comparable accuracy and comparable or higher precision; moreover, the analysis time is approximately 500 times faster. We demonstrate the ﬁrst laser-locked Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift measurement: we have adapted this technique, replacing the lock in ampliﬁer and <b>ratiometer,</b> which were previously essential, with {{digital signal processing}}. Rather than using a traditional unstabilised cavity, we have used our laser-locked instrument to generate data with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) : this improvement in the SNR, along with our rapid signal processing, results in a sensitivity two orders of magnitude higher than any other CAPS experiment in the literature. We show that the sampling rate may be reduced to a point where the data processing runs faster than data is generated: this oﬀers the prospect of real time analysis. We show that our Fourier transform based signal processing method may also be applied to the analysis of single exponential decays: we have implemented the data processing on a field programmable gate array that extracts, in real time, the ringdown time from a Pulsed CRD Spectrometer...|$|E
40|$|The {{utility of}} breath trace {{compounds}} as bio-markers for various physiological conditions {{has long been}} exploited for the diagnosis of various diseases. Urea breath tests have been adopted as {{the gold standard for}} the detection of Helicobacter pylori which is a primary cause for acute gastritis and peptic ulcers. In these tests, small changes in the ratio of stable CO 2 isotopomers, 13 CO 2 and 12 CO 2, present in exhaled breath are measured precisely and this is conventionally done by using an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer. However, the huge cost and complexity involved in operating these instruments has restricted their widespread use. A viable and low cost alternative is offered by instruments employing non-dispersive infrared absorption techniques. The feasibility of such an instrument has been explored in this work. The instrument presented here is a two channel isotope <b>ratiometer</b> that performs whole band integrated absorption measurements. Detection is based on a novel feedback mech- anism whereby an imbalance in the channel absorptions causes the pathlength along one of the channels to be altered in order to bring the system back to balance. This change in ratio of pathlengths {{is directly related to the}} change in the 13 CO 2 / 12 CO 2 concentration. Signffcant amount of work has already been done to investigate the effects of interferences from coincident absorption bands and other spectral effects that can lead to spurious results. A comprehensive description of the overall system design, development and performance evaluation of the first prototype instrument has been presented here. This involved significant computer modeling and simulations and the results were verified experimentally. These results provided sufficient evidence to suggest the feasibility of such an instrument as a diagnostic tool. It was also concluded that some design improvements were required to circumvent issues related to pathlength variation and a list of recommendations has been provided for this purpose. On the basis of the results obtained as part of this research endeavour, it was concluded that the non-dispersive instrument design presented here can form the basis for a low cost commercial alternative for performing carbon isotope ratio breath tests.
