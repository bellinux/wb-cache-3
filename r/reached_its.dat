5|$|A {{vigorous}} upper-level low developed west of Alberto on August 7 and August 8. This {{caused an}} increase in vertical shear, weakening the hurricane down to a tropical storm on August 9. The low also caused the storm {{to turn to the}} northwest. However, on August 10, Alberto became better organised and was upgraded to hurricane status again. It then moved in a gradual curve towards the north and northeast through a break in a subtropical ridge between August 11 and August 12. Alberto made its closest approach to Bermuda on August 11, passing about 345mi (555km) east of the island. The strong storm became a Category3 major hurricane on August 12 and <b>reached</b> <b>its</b> second and highest peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), and a 60mi (95km) wide eye was observed. Alberto was an unusual storm in that it <b>reached</b> <b>its</b> peak intensity at a high latitude, north of 35˚N, after it had re-curved. The hurricane began to weaken due to increasing upper-level westerlies on August 13 and August 14, while moving east-northeastward. Alberto was downgraded to a tropical storm on August 14.|$|E
5|$|After {{affecting}} Guam, Chataan continued {{toward the}} northwest and gradually intensified. At 0000UTC on July8, the typhoon <b>reached</b> <b>its</b> peak intensity of 175km/h (110mph 10-minute sustained) while {{located near the}} Japanese island of Okinotorishima. The JTWC assessed that Chataan had <b>reached</b> <b>its</b> peak intensity of 240km/h (150mph 1-minute sustained) about six hours earlier; on that basis, the agency classified {{the system as a}} super typhoon. On July8, Chataan turned toward the north around the subtropical ridge while maintaining its peak winds for about 18hours. On July9 the typhoon turned to the northeast, and late that day it weakened to a severe tropical storm. At around 1530UTC on July10, Chataan made landfall on the Bōsō Peninsula in Honshu with winds of about 100km/h (65mph 10-minute sustained). The storm briefly moved offshore before making a second landfall on eastern Hokkaido at 1200UTC on July11; this marked the first occasion of a July landfall on the island in 28years. A few hours later, Chataan became an extratropical cyclone in the Sea of Okhotsk, where the remnants stalled before dissipating on July13 near Sakhalin.|$|E

5|$|After {{undergoing}} {{a brief period}} of rapid intensification from 18:00UTC on October29 – 06:00UTC on October30, the hurricane <b>reached</b> <b>its</b> peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 115mph (185km/h) and a minimum pressure of 962mbar (hPa; 28.42inHg). The storm also began to turn towards the south-southwest as it <b>reached</b> <b>its</b> peak intensity and its maximum size, with tropical storm-force winds extending out 60mi (95km) from the center. However, as it neared the coast, cloud tops around the eye began to warm, signifying weakening. Around 12:00UTC on October30, Beta made landfall in central Nicaragua near La Barra del Rio Grande with winds of 105mph (165km/h). After making landfall, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm, with winds decreasing to 65mph (100km/h), as the structure of the storm began to deteriorate. Early on October31, Beta weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated a few hours later over the mountains of central Nicaragua.|$|E
