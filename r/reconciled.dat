In this version, Set is not <b>reconciled</b> with his rival, but utterly defeated, and sometimes he is exiled from Egypt or even destroyed.

40|$|We {{have created}} a {{software}} infrastructure called <b>Reconcile</b> that is a platform {{for the development of}} learning-based noun phrase (NP) coreference resolution systems. <b>Reconcile’s</b> architecture was designed to facilitate the rapid creation of coreference resolutions systems, easy implementation of new feature sets and approaches to coreference resolution, and empirical evaluation of coreference resolvers across a variety of benchmark data sets and standard scoring metrics. <b>Reconcile</b> is written in Java and can be easily customized with different subcomponents, feature sets, and parameter settings. In this report, we describe <b>Reconcile’s</b> architecture, processing pipeline, and the subcomponents and algorithms that are currently implemented and available in <b>Reconcile.</b> We also present experimental results showing that <b>Reconcile</b> can be used to create a coreference resolver which achieves performance levels comparable to state-of-the-art systems on six benchmark data sets. ...|$|R
