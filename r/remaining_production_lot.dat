30|$|Transnational companies, {{operating}} in extremely competitive global markets, always seek to lower different operating costs, such as inventory holding costs in their intra- supply chain system. This paper incorporates a cost reducing product distribution policy into an intra-supply chain system with multiple sales locations and quality assurance studied by [Chiu et al., Expert Syst Appl, 40 : 2669 – 2676, (2013)]. Under the proposed cost reducing distribution policy, an added initial delivery of end items is distributed to multiple sales locations {{to meet their}} demand during the production unit’s uptime and rework time. After rework when the <b>remaining</b> <b>production</b> <b>lot</b> goes through quality assurance, n fixed quantity installments of finished items are then transported to sales locations at a fixed time interval. Mathematical modeling and optimization techniques are used to derive closed-form optimal operating policies for the proposed system. Furthermore, the study demonstrates significant savings in stock holding costs for both the production unit and sales locations. Alternative of outsourcing product delivery task to an external distributor is analyzed to assist managerial decision making in potential outsourcing issues {{in order to facilitate}} further reduction in operating costs.|$|E

Dobos and Richter (2004) flourished a production and recycling inventory model with n number of recycling lots and m number of <b>production</b> <b>lots.</b> Teunter (2004) developed EPQ models with rework {{with respect to}} two policies. In the first policy, m number <b>production</b> <b>lots</b> are alternated with one recovery lot, (m, 1) policy; in the other policy, one <b>production</b> <b>lot</b> is alternated with n recovery lots, (1, n) policy.

First, we obtain the optimal product inspection policies for different PSPL for a given lot in the in-control or out-of-control state. Properties for the inspection policy are explored. Then, the expected total cost function, which includes setup cost, process maintenance cost and quality-related control cost, is obtained. The optimal <b>production</b> <b>lot</b> size that minimizes the expected total cost per item is determined. Our proposed inspection policy is compared with the three policies of no inspection, full inspection, and disregarding the first s items policy, in which only items from s+ 1 until the end of the <b>production</b> <b>lot</b> are inspected. Differences in the minimum expected total cost per item between our proposed inspection policy and the other three policies are investigated with a numerical example...|$|R

40|$|Effective {{scheduling}} of <b>production</b> <b>lots</b> is {{of great}} importance for manufacturing medium to high-volume products that require significant setup times. Compared to traditional entire-lot <b>production,</b> <b>lot</b> splitting techniques divide a <b>production</b> <b>lot</b> into multiple smaller sublots so that each sublot can be "transferred" from one stage of operation to the next {{as soon as it}} has been completed. "Transfer lots," therefore, significantly reduce lead times and lower work-in-process (WIP) inventory. The mathematical modeling, analysis, and control of transfer lots, however, is extremely difficult. This paper presents a novel integer programming formulation with separable structure for scheduling job shops with fixed-size transfer lots. A solution methodology based on a synergistic combination of Lagrangian relaxation, backward dynamic programming (BDP), and heuristics is developed. Through explicit modeling of lot dynamics, transfer lots are handled on standard machines, machines with setups, and machines requiring all transfer <b>lots</b> within a <b>production</b> <b>lot</b> to be processed simultaneously. With "substates" and the derivation of DP functional equations considering transfer lot dynamics, the standard BDP is extended to solve the lot-level subproblems. The recently developed "time step reduction technique" is also used for increased efficiency. It implicitly establishes two time scales to reduce computational requirements without much loss of modeling accuracy and scheduling performance, thus enabling resolution of long-horizon problems within controllable computational requirements. The method has been implemented using object-oriented programming language C++, and numerical tests show that high-quality schedules involving transfer lots are efficiently generated to achieve on-time delivery of products with low WIP inventory...|$|R

Traditional lot splitting and lot streaming models implicitly assume that the entire system is operated and owned by the same firm, or there exists a coordinator who controls the operation of all machines in the system. In this paper, we consider the situation where the machines in a multiple-stage production process are owned and managed by different companies. Every item in a given <b>production</b> <b>lot</b> {{has to go through}} the processing by the supplier's machine, followed by the manufacturer's machine, and so on. We develop and analyze coordination mechanisms that enable different parties in the supply chain to coordinate their lot splitting decisions so as to achieve a systemwide optimum.
