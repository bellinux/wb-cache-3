It is {{to him that the}} retailer and libraries look for supplies, as it is impossible to stock all of the books published. Paternoster Row, London, was for over a hundred years the centre of this industry, where retail booksellers, busily engaged in obtaining the books ordered by the book-buying public. It is where the publisher calls first on showing or [...] "subscribing" [...] a new book, a critical process, for by the number thus ordered the fate of a book is sometimes determined. In the United States, Baker & Taylor is a major distributor.|$|E

This article focuses therefore, rather than on prices themselves, on the processes that were put in motion for the pricing of books for sales by publishers or wholesalers, and then by <b>retail</b> <b>booksellers.</b> I will go on to analyse the prices actually paid by purchasers, on the basis of documentation relating to some of the great book collectors, and explore whether and how the various authorities, religious and governmental, intervened in the establishment of book prices and for what purpose. Finally, I will present a project on book prices in early modern Europe, which will be carried out in the years 2016 - 2020 thanks to the recent award of an ERC Grant...|$|R
50|$|In October 2008, {{the parties}} {{involved}} in the lawsuit proposed a settlement agreement, which called for Google to pay out $125 million: $45 million to the rightsholders whose copyrights had allegedly been infringed; $15.5 million for the publishers' legal fees; $30 million to the authors' lawyers; and $34.5 million to create a Book Rights Registry, a form of copyright collective that would collect revenues from Google and dispense them to the rightsholders. In exchange, the agreement released Google and its library partners from liability for its book digitization. The agreement was built upon an intricate joint venture arrangement {{for the management of}} Google's book project, including a variety of revenue models. Google would generate revenue from its books project through an institutional subscription for libraries, a consumer subscription for indefinite access to individual books, referral links to <b>retail</b> <b>booksellers,</b> and advertising on book pages.|$|R

40|$|Publisher's chapter description: Likewise {{with books}} bound after what manner you please. It is {{as well to}} {{remember}} this statement {{when looking at the}} work of the hundreds of binders active throughout the United Kingdom over the period covered by this volume, who would have laboured for much of the time on individual commissions from <b>retail</b> <b>booksellers</b> (if they did not serve this function themselves), institutional libraries or private individuals, seeking to have books bought in sheets, paper wrappers or other temporary bindings put into permanent ones. For most of the eighteenth century, only the very cheapest end of the trade, such as school-books, popular romances and devotional works, typically sold books bound and delivered direct to the end-user, though the sale of bound bibles and liturgical works was something of an exception to that. It is in the second decade of the nineteenth century that significant numbers of editions were for the first time issued bound in what were intended to be permanent bindings. It is also important to remember that the bindings we know best from the literature – generally the more extensively decorated bindings – formed only a very small part of the trade. This chapter will therefore take as its main focus the more standard types of binding and the more ephemeral protection offered to text blocks within the book trade; the reader is directed to the existing literature for a more detailed accountof the more extensively decorated books...|$|R

40|$|How did print {{spread through}} France {{to become a}} major force during the eighteenth century? This {{question}} has remained unanswered because we know surprisingly little about the infrastructure of the book trade. Between state and market: printing and bookselling in eighteenth-century France explores the networks of printers and booksellers that covered eighteenth-century France, situating these key cultural intermediaries within their political and socio-economic environments. To draw an overview of printing and bookselling, and to chart their evolution across the century, the author analyzes a series of administrative surveys conducted between 1700 and 1777 by the Direction de la librairie. The hundreds of reports the central administration gathered on every printing shop and bookseller in the kingdom reveal not only where book professionals could be found and who they were, but what materials they were printing and what books they were selling. Survey responses also show that book policing was deficient {{in most of the}} provinces, allowing pirated and forbidden books to pour into the kingdom from nearby foreign presses. Unable to control the circulation of books, the administration resorted to an austere Colbertist policy to restrict the number of printing shops. State intervention brought a decline in provincial book publishing, but printers could still thrive on job printing, local-interest publications and pirating. By contrast, the central administration let booksellers of all kinds proliferate, particularly {{in the second half of}} the century. Better suited than traditional printer-booksellers to supply whatever books readers wanted, <b>retail</b> <b>booksellers</b> cashed in on a booming market demand. Examining the booktrade from each provincial city upwards, the author tracks the intricate web of relations between state, market, local institutions and book professionals that shaped the diffusion of print, and thereby the development of French literature and the experience of everyday readers.

50|$|The {{roots of}} the NFRN {{can be traced back}} to late 19th Century when local groups across the north of England, formed to bring {{together}} retailers in locations such as Blackburn, Accrington and Burnley. The <b>Retail</b> Newsagents and <b>Booksellers</b> Union was formed in 1891 at the Congregational Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street - a short walk away from the Federation's current offices, Yeoman House. The Union had branches in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Brighton and Reading but broke up amid infighting in 1901. Whilst one Union was faltering, another, the Northern Counties Union, was formed in Manchester. The NCU is the first organization who can claim unbroken descendants to today. A third union - the National Union, was founded in 1902 but was dissolved in 1915.|$|R
