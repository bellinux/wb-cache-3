Relays {{are used to}} help forward signals between a transmitter and a receiver. This helps increase the signal coverage and reduce the required transmitted signal power. One problem that faces relays communications is the leaked signal from the <b>relay's</b> <b>output</b> to its input. This will cause an SI problem where the new received signal at the relay's input will be added with the unwanted leaked signal from the <b>relay's</b> <b>output.</b> A Solution is proposed in this paper to estimate and minimise this SI which is based upon using a tapped filter at the destination. To get the optimum weights for this tapped filter, some channel parameters must be estimated first. This is performed blindly at the destination without the need of any training. This channel parameter estimation method is named the blind-self-interference-channel-estimation (BSICE) method. The {{next step in the}} proposed solution is to estimate the tapped filter's weights. This is performed by minimising the mean squared error (MSE) at the destination. This proposed method is named the MSE-Optimum Weight (MSE-OW) method.

We propose the Colour-and-Forward relaying scheme which constructs a graph GR of <b>relay</b> <b>outputs</b> based on the joint conditional distribution of the <b>relay</b> and destination <b>outputs</b> given the channel input. The colours of this graph GR are sent over the out-of-band link in the primitive relay channel and are shown to be information lossless in the zero-error sense; they result in the same confusability graph as if the destination had the relay’s received signal. This allows us to obtain an upper bound 1 on the minimum required conference rate required for the relay and destination terminals to be effectively fully cooperative for any number of channel use n...|$|R

40|$|OAPA In this paper, the {{transceiver}} beamforming {{problem is}} studied for multipair two-way distributed relay networks, particularly with multi-antenna user nodes {{and in the}} presence of channel state errors. With multi-antenna setting on the user nodes, some of the usual signal processing tasks are shifted from the relay nodes to the user nodes with the proposed transceiver beamforming designs. The transmit beamforming vectors, distributed relay coefficients and the receive beamforming vectors are obtained by iteratively solving three sub-problems, each having a closed-form solution. The tasks of maximizing desired signal power, and reducing inter-pair interference (IPI) and noise are thus allocated to different iteration steps. By this arrangement, the transmit and receive beamformers of each user are responsible for improving its own performance and the distributed relay nodes with simple amplify-and-forward protocol aim at creating a comfortable communication environment for all user pairs. With respect to the channel uncertainty, two relay strategies are proposed considering two different requirements from the communication network: sum <b>relay</b> <b>output</b> power and individual <b>relay</b> <b>output</b> power. Our simulation demonstrates that the performance improvement can be very significant through cooperation of the three components, especially when the number of relay nodes is large...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{distributed}} coding for sensor networks. We consider energy-and-complexity-constrained sensors that communicate with a distant sink {{at a relatively}} low data rate {{with the help of}} a relay with higher-power and better-processing capabilities. We assume an orthogonal multiple access to the resources. Sources transmit independently and use simple short block codes to limit delay and complexity. The relay performs network encoding of the detected codewords and forwards either partial or complete coded information. The sink jointly decodes observations coming both from sources and relay to simultaneously estimate the information sent by the source nodes. We first analyse the cooperative scheme from an information theoretical point of view in order to determine the resource allocation strategy between the sources and the relay, which maximizes the overall network sum-rate. When a single relay is used and the source-to-relay link is not error-free, occasional detection errors introduce additional errors at the <b>relay</b> <b>output,</b> which, in turn, critically affect decoding performance and yield error-floors at the destination. In the case of a distributed coding scheme based on product codes, we obtain a closed-form asymptotically-tight approximation of the error probability under a minimum-distance decoding of the product code at the destination. The proposed analysis takes explicitly into account the error propagation at the <b>relay</b> <b>output</b> and may be extended to other forms of distributed coding schemes...|$|E
