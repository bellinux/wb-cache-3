25|$|Industrial {{biotechnology}} (known {{mainly in}} Europe as white biotechnology) is {{the application of}} biotechnology for industrial purposes, including industrial fermentation. It includes the practice of using cells such as micro-organisms, or components of cells like enzymes, to generate industrially useful products in sectors such as chemicals, food and feed, detergents, paper and pulp, textiles and biofuels. In doing so, biotechnology uses <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> and may contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and moving away from a petrochemical-based economy.|$|E
2500|$|Interest in {{sustainable}} [...] "green" [...] products {{raised some}} interest in polyols derived from vegetable oils. Many polyols are derived from <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> like vegetable oils. Vegetable oils are functionalized by different ways and modified to polyetheramide, polyethers, alkyds, etc. Various oils used in the preparation polyols for polyurethanes include soybean, cotton seed, neem seed, and castor. Renewable source used to prepare polyols may be dimer fatty acid [...] or fatty acid. Recently neem oil acetylated polyester polyol have been prepared as a renewable alternative to petro based polyols. [...] Moreover, the said polyol was used to formulate self-healing polyurethane coatings using encapsulated core materials.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> in {{technical}} products or consumer goods always requires the additional use of non-renewable resources. Regarding the whole {{product life cycle}} the total demand of non-renewable resources can be higher than the demand of a comparable petrochemical product in concrete cases. Saving resources by using <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> will only be achieved if the whole system is carefully optimized. Biodegradability means no disadvantage concerning waste management, if a suitable labelling and a distinguished waste collection is provided. Biodegradability is an advantageous property only in those cases where it is implicitly demanded by the application (example: waste bag {{which is supposed to}} be composted including its content) ...|$|R

The {{article focuses}} on the {{research}} and development of a new composite material applicable in building industry, <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> resources and industrial waste materials.

40|$|Renewable {{resources}} pose special {{challenges to}} process synthesis. Due to decentral <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> generation, usually low transport densities and the perishable character of most <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> materi-als {{in combination with}} their time dependent availability, logistical questions as well as adaptation to regional agricultural structures are necessary. This calls for synthesis of structures not only of single processes but of the whole value chain attached to the utilisation of a certain resource. As most of the innovative technologies proposed to build on a <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> base face stiff economic competition from fossil based processes, economic optimality of the value chain is crucial to their implementation. On top of this widening of the process definition for synthesis, many processes {{on the base of}} renewable resources apply technologies (like membrane separations, chromatographic purifi-cation steps, etc.) for which the heuristic knowledge is still slim. This reduces the choice of methods for process synthesis, mainly to methods based on combinatorial principles. The paper investigates applicability as well as impact on technology development of process synthesis for <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> utilisation. It takes logistic considerations into account and applies process synthesis to the case study of the green biorefinery concept...|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of this review article {{considers}} general data about ethanol as an industrial product, its qualities and uses. It is emphasized that, if produced from biomass as a <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material,</b> its perspectives as a chemical <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> and energent are brilliant. Starchy grains, such as corn, must be used as the main <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> for ethanol production. The production of bioethanol by the enzyme-catalyzed conversion of starch followed by (yeast) fermentation, distillation is the process of choice. If used as a motor fuel, anhydrous ethanol can be directly blended with gasoline or converted into an oxygenator such as ETBE. Finally, bioethanol production in Yugoslavia and the possibilities for its further development are discussed...|$|R
30|$|Wood {{has been}} widely used as {{construction}} material mainly in the building industry {{because it is a}} natural material, has esthetic aspects, is a <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material,</b> and has excellent natural flame resistance due to low thermal conductivity [1 – 3]. Even though wood is flame-resistant, it is still prone to catch fire. The limitation of wood as building material is its flammability and smoke; therefore, fire-retardant materials have been developed and used in building materials [3]. The materials, which are not affected by fire, do not exist in the world although many researchers are studying about fire-retardant agent for indoor material.|$|R
