40|$|The {{development}} of earth system models that will simulate {{the past and}} present and provide predictions of future conditions is essential now that human activities have the potential to induce changes in the planetary environment. Critical aspects of global change include its pervasiveness and ubiquity, its distribution in several distinct time-scale bands, and the interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, land surface, and the terrestrial and marine biospheres. A model of the earth system on the scale of decades to centuries, developed by the Earth System Science Committee (NASA) with the strategy of dividing by time scale rather than discipline, is presented and the <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>observations</b> to support the implementation of the model are reviewed...|$|E
40|$|The {{release of}} latent heat of {{condensation}} {{is the largest}} internal energy source of the atmosphere. Latent heating is most significant during the precipitation process.

Thus, there are strong scientific <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>observations</b> of precipitation from instruments on board a satellite. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) will be the first satellite to measure rainfall with adequate accuracy and provide information about the vertical distribution of precipitation, not only in tropics and subtropics, but to plus or minus 35 degrees of latitude. There is a need for the continuity of rain observations for climate modeling purposes and to expand observations to cover more of the globe than simply plus or minus 35 degrees latitude...|$|E

Its {{focus is on the}} combined use of observations and modelling to address the functioning, predictability and projected evolution of interacting components of the Earth system on timescales out to a century or so. It discusses how observations support integrated Earth-system science and its applications, and identifies planned enhancements to the contributing observing systems and other <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>observations</b> and their processing. All types of observation are considered, but emphasis is placed on those made from space. The origins and development of the integrated view of the Earth system are outlined, noting the interactions between the main components that lead to requirements for integrated science and modelling, and for the observations that guide and support them. What constitutes an Earth-system model is discussed. Summaries are given of key cycles within the Earth system. The nature of Earth observation and the arrangements for international coordination essential for effective operation of global observing systems are introduced. Instances are given of present types of observation, what is already on the roadmap for 2016 – 2025 and some of the issues to be faced. Observations that are organised on a systematic basis and observations that are made for process understanding and model development, or other research or demonstration purposes, are covered. Specific accounts are given for many of the variables of the Earth system. The current status and prospects for Earth-system modelling are summarized. The evolution towards applying Earth-system models for environmental monitoring and prediction as well as for climate simulation and projection is outlined. General aspects of the improvement of models, whether through refining the representations of processes that are already incorporated or through adding new processes or components, are discussed. Some important elements of Earth-system models are considered more fully. Data assimilation is discussed not only because it uses observations and models to generate datasets for monitoring the Earth system and for initiating and evaluating predictions, in particular through reanalysis, but also because of the feedback it provides on the quality of both the observations and the models employed. Inverse methods for surface-flux or model-parameter estimation are also covered. Reviews are given of the way observations and the processed datasets based on them are used for evaluating models, and of the combined use of observations and models for monitoring and interpreting the behaviour of the Earth system and for predicting and projecting its future.

40|$|Predator-prey {{interactions}} of large vagile fishes {{are difficult to}} study in the ocean due to limitations in the space and time <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>observations.</b> Small-scale direct underwater observations by divers (3 ̆c 10 m 3 ̆eradius) and large-scale hydroacoustic surveys (10 s - 100 s km 2) are traditional approaches. However, large piscivorous predators identify and attack prey at the scale of meters to tens of meters. Dual- Frequency Identification Sonar, or DIDSON, is a high-resolution acoustic camera operating in the MHz range that provides detailed continuous video-like imaging of objects out to 30 m range. This technology {{can be used to}} observe predator-prey interactions at ecologically relevant space and time scales often missed by traditional methods. Here I establish an approach for quantifying predation related behaviors from DIDSON records. Metrics related to predator and prey group size, prey responses to predation, predation rate, predator strategies, and the non-random use of landscape features by both predator and prey are described, relationships between patterns in these attributes are tested, and issues regarding sampling strategies for future studies are discussed. Approaches combining direct visual observation and acoustic sampling at multiple scales are required to gain a greater understanding of variation in such relationships across underwater landscapes and the role such relationships play in the demographics of fish populations and communities...|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} a road pricing scheme that aims to {{restrict}} link traffic flows on a network within a predetermined upper-bound, such as road physical or environmental capacity. In our previous sequential experimental approach, the optimal link tolls are obtained, without resorting to both analytical travel cost and demand functions. In each trial, two steps are involved, prediction and correction, based on the observed link flows associated with a given link toll pattern. One key assumption made in the study is that the observed link flows are exactly in a deterministic equilibrium. This assumption is of course questionable in real applications, {{given the fact that}} travelers need sufficient time to learn and adjust their trip-making decisions in a new pricing environment. In this study, the exact prediction-correction method is modified to a partially inexact trial method, whose convergence is established theoretically. Numerical experiment shows that the partially inexact trial method is even more cost efficient in terns of the overall convergence rate. The extension thus obviates the <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> <b>observation</b> of exact deterministic traffic equilibrium after each price experiment and makes the sequential experimental approach more robust in real applications...|$|R

40|$|Solitary {{waves in}} {{materials}} with a cascaded x(2) :x(2) nonlinearity are investigated, {{and the implications}} of the robustness hypothesis for these solitary waves are discussed. Both temporal and spatial solitary waves are studied. First, the basic equations that describe the x(2) :x(2) nonlinearity in the presence of dispersion or diffraction are derived in the plane-wave approximation, and we show that these equations reduce to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation in the limit of large phase mismatch and can be considered a Hamiltonian deformation of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. We then proceed to a comprehensive description of all the solitary-wave solutions of the basic equations that can be expressed as a simple sum of a constant term, a term proportional to a power of the hyperbolic secant, and a term proportional to a power of the hyperbolic secant multiplied by the hyperbolic tangent. This formulation includes all the previously known solitary-wave solutions and some exotic new ones as well. Our solutions are derived in the presence of an arbitrary group-velocity difference between the two harmonics, but a transformation that relates our solutions to zero-velocity solutions is derived. We find that all the solitary-wave solutions are zero-parameter and one-parameter families, as opposed to nonlinear-Schrödinger-equation solitons, which are a two-parameter family of solutions. Finally, we discuss the prediction of the robustness hypothesis {{that there should be a}} two-parameter family of solutions with solitonlike behavior, and we discuss the experimental <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>observation</b> of solitonlike behavior.
