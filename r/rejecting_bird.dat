6000|$|First {{published}} in the [...] "Westminster Review," [...] July, 1867.

30|$|The {{efficacy}} of bird spikes {{to reduce the}} pigeon population index on campus was {{significantly different from the}} other control methods, and thus the null hypothesis was <b>rejected.</b> <b>Bird</b> spikes were found to be the most successful in reducing the pigeon population (nearly 70  %) as pigeons were physically hindered from perching on the treated building. Seamans et al. (2007) described similar findings at an airport; their research found the anti-perching spikes to be effective against preventing pigeons from perching on buildings. Based on biological principles, the spikes deny access to sites selected by pigeons (Harris and Davies 1998). Nonetheless faeces and debris caught in the spikes can render them redundant and ineffective (Barnes 1997) when pigeons build their nests on top of this accumulation. Ongoing maintenance and monitoring is therefore essential to retain efficacy.|$|R

60|$|Odour.—With some animals, as {{with the}} notorious skunk of America, the {{overwhelming}} odour which they emit appears to serve exclusively {{as a means of}} defence. With shrew-mice (Sorex) both sexes possess abdominal scent-glands, and there can be little doubt, from the manner in which their bodies are <b>rejected</b> by <b>birds</b> and beasts of prey, that their odour is protective; nevertheless the glands become enlarged in the males during the breeding-season. In many quadrupeds the glands are of the same size in both sexes;[340] but their use is not known. In other species the glands are confined to the males, or are more developed in them than in the females; and they almost always become more active during the rutting-season. At this period the glands {{on the sides of the}} face of the male elephant enlarge and emit a secretion having a strong musky odour.|$|R
50|$|The avian T cell population, {{like that}} of mammals {{develops}} in the thymus. However, the thymus in birds is a paired organ composed of many separated lobes of ovoid tissue in the neck. These {{are close to the}} vagus nerve and the jugular vein and are most active in young hatchlings. It is postulated that this organ is linked to erythropoeitic function and closely associated with the avian breeding cycle. The removal of the thymic lobes has been correlated to <b>birds</b> <b>rejecting</b> allogeneic skingrafts and delayed skin reactions.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A turkey subline at the Ohio Agricultural Research and De-velopment Center was {{developed}} by DNA typing of the MHC using a chicken MHC Class II probe, and it segregated for specific MHC genotypes. Histocom-patibility was examined between turkeys of known MHC genotype using skin graft procedures, mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR), and graft-versus-host reactions (GVHR). Skin grafts were exchanged among 3 -wk-old turkeys and {{it was found that}} when birds shared DNA patterns (genotypes), the skin grafts were usually accepted. In contrast, skin grafts were always <b>rejected</b> when <b>birds</b> did not share the identical DNA pattern. Similarly, MLR only occurred when the lymphocytes were derived from birds that did not share the same DNA pattern. Lastly, GVHR were examined in embryos injected with either sire or dam blood. The GVHR in embryos was dependent on the parental MHC genotype. Four MHC haplotypes were identified in the turkey subline. The turkey MHC has been designated MhcMega-B, and each of the haplotypes, Mega-B 1 through Mega-B (Key words: major histocompatibility complex, mixed lymphocyte reaction, graft-versus-host splenomegaly, skin graft reaction, genotype...|$|R
60|$|The only case of {{probable}} mimicry in our {{own country}} is the following:--A very common white moth (Spilosoma menthastri) was found by Mr. Stainton to be rejected by young turkeys among hundreds of other moths on which they greedily fed. Each bird in succession took hold of this moth and threw it down again, as if too nasty to eat. Mr. Jenner Weir also found that this moth was refused by the Bullfinch, Chaffinch, Yellow Hammer, and Red Bunting, but eaten after much hesitation by the Robin. We may therefore fairly conclude that this species would be disagreeable to many other birds, and would thus have an immunity from attack, which may be the cause of its great abundance and of its conspicuous white colour. Now it is a curious thing that there is another moth, Diaphora mendica, which appears about the same time, and whose female only is white. It is about the same size as Spilosoma menthastri, and sufficiently resembles it in the dusk, and this moth is much less common. It seems very probable, therefore, that these species stand in the same relation to each other as the mimicking butterflies of various families do to the Heliconidæ and Danaidæ. It would be very interesting to experiment on all white moths, to ascertain if those which are most common are generally <b>rejected</b> by <b>birds.</b> It may be anticipated that they would be so, because white is the most conspicuous of all colours for nocturnal insects, and had they not some other protection would certainly be very injurious to them.|$|R
40|$|Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) {{reproductive}} {{development is}} affected by the photoperiod (Putman & Hinde, 1973), and nest-hole entry by the female is accelerated by oestrogen (Hutchison, 1971). In the canary, long photoperiods affect nest-building behaviour, not only by the classical hypothalamus=m-=m- gonad route, but also by influencing the effectiveness of exogenous oestrogen in ovariectomized birds (Steel & Hinde, 1972). The present experiments were designed to assess whether the latter effect occurs also in the budgerigar. Ovariectomy was performed by suction and cautery under sodium pento-barbitone and ether anaesthesia. After the operation the birds were transferred singly to the experimental cages and kept on an 11 hr light: 13 hr dark (11 L: 13 D) regimen for 2 days. The nest-box entrance was then opened and the birds tested for a further 7 days. Nest-box entry was assessed by {{the presence or absence of}} marks on a piece of smoked paper placed inside the box. Any birds entering during this period were <b>rejected.</b> The remaining <b>birds</b> were allocated randomly to the experimental groups. The birds were injected at approximatel...|$|R
60|$|It {{is among}} the groups that possess some of these varied kinds of {{protection}} in a high degree, that we find {{the greatest amount of}} conspicuous colour, or at least the most complete absence of protective imitation. The stinging Hymenoptera, wasps, bees, and hornets, are, as a rule, very showy and brilliant insects, and {{there is not a single}} instance recorded in which any one of them is coloured so as to resemble a vegetable or inanimate substance. The Chrysididæ, or golden wasps, which do not sting, possess as a substitute the power of rolling themselves up into a ball, which is almost as hard and polished as if really made of metal,--and they are all adorned with the most gorgeous colours. The whole order Hemiptera (comprising the bugs) emit a powerful odour, and they present a very large proportion of gay-coloured and conspicuous insects. The lady-birds (Coccinellidæ) and their allies the Eumorphidæ, are often brightly spotted, as if to attract attention; but they can both emit fluids of a very disagreeable nature, they are certainly <b>rejected</b> by some <b>birds,</b> and are probably never eaten by any.|$|R
6000|$|Since {{this essay}} was first {{published}} a very curious difficulty has been cleared up by {{the application of the}} general principle of protective colouring. Great numbers of caterpillars are so brilliantly marked and coloured as to be very conspicuous even at a considerable distance, and it has been noticed that such caterpillars seldom hide themselves. Other species, however, are green or brown, closely resembling the colours of the substances on which they feed, while others again imitate sticks, and stretch themselves out motionless from a twig so as to look like one of its branches. Now, as caterpillars form so large a part of the food of birds, it was not easy to understand why any of them should have such bright colours and markings as to make them specially visible. Mr. Darwin had put the case to me as a difficulty from another point of view, for he had arrived at the conclusion that brilliant colouration in the animal kingdom is mainly due to sexual selection, and this could not have acted in the case of sexless larvæ. Applying here the analogy of other insects, I reasoned, that since some caterpillars were evidently protected by their imitative colouring, and others by their spiny or hairy bodies, the bright colours of the rest must also be in some way useful to them. I further thought that as some butterflies and moths were greedily eaten by birds while others were distasteful to them, and these latter were mostly of conspicuous colours, so probably these brilliantly coloured caterpillars were distasteful, and therefore never eaten by birds. Distastefulness alone would however be of little service to caterpillars, because their soft and juicy bodies are so delicate, that if seized and afterwards <b>rejected</b> by a <b>bird</b> they would almost certainly be killed. Some constant and easily perceived signal was therefore necessary to serve as a warning to birds never to touch these uneatable kinds, and a very gaudy and conspicuous colouring with the habit of fully exposing themselves to view becomes such a signal, being in strong contrast with the green or brown tints and retiring habits of the eatable kinds. The subject was brought by me before the Entomological Society (see Proceedings, March 4th, 1867), in order that those members having opportunities for making observations might do so in the following summer; and I also {{wrote a letter to the}} Field newspaper, begging that some of its readers would co-operate in making observations on what insects were <b>rejected</b> by <b>birds,</b> at the same time fully explaining the great interest and scientific importance of the problem. It is a curious example of how few of the country readers of that paper are at all interested in questions of simple natural history, that I only obtained one answer from a gentleman in Cumberland, who gave me some interesting observations on the general dislike and abhorrence of all birds to the [...] "Gooseberry Caterpillar," [...] probably that of the Magpie-moth (Abraxas grossulariata). Neither young pheasants, partridges, nor wild-ducks could be induced to eat it, sparrows and finches never touched it, and all birds to whom he offered it rejected it with evident dread and abhorrence. It will be seen that these observations are confirmed by those of two members of the Entomological Society to whom we are indebted for more detailed information.|$|R
60|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{appears at}} first sight very bold; {{but when it was}} brought before the Entomological Society[533] it was supported by various statements; and Mr. J. Jenner Weir, who keeps a large number of birds in an aviary, has made, as he informs me, numerous trials, and finds no exception to the rule, that all caterpillars of nocturnal and retiring habits with smooth skins, all of a green colour, and all which imitate twigs, are greedily devoured by his birds. The hairy and spinose kinds are invariably rejected, as were four conspicuously-coloured species. When the <b>birds</b> <b>rejected</b> a caterpillar, they plainly shewed, by shaking their heads and cleansing their beaks, that they were disgusted by the taste.[534] Three conspicuous kinds of caterpillars and moths were also given by Mr. A. Butler to some lizards and frogs, and were rejected; though other kinds were eagerly eaten. Thus the probable truth of Mr. Wallace’s view is confirmed, namely, that certain caterpillars have been made conspicuous for their own good, so as to be easily recognised by their enemies, on nearly the same principle that certain poisons are coloured by druggists for the good of man. This view will, it is probable, be hereafter extended to many animals, which are coloured in a conspicuous manner.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between flock health and Campylobacter infection of housed commercial broilers in Great Britain. Thirty ceca were collected at slaughter from batches of broilers from 789 flocks, at either full or partial depopulation, between December 2003 and March 2006 and examined individually for Campylobacter by direct plating onto selective media. Management and health {{data were collected from}} each flock and included information on mortality or culling during rearing, the number of <b>birds</b> <b>rejected</b> for infectious or noninfectious causes at slaughter, the proportion of birds with digital dermatitis (also termed hock burn), and other general characteristics of the flock. Campylobacter spp. were isolated from 280 (35 %) flocks. The relationship between bird health and welfare and Campylobacter status of flocks was assessed using random-effects logistic regression models, adjusting for region, month, year, and rearing regime. Campylobacter-positive batches of ceca were associated with higher levels of rejection due to infection (odds ratio [OR], 1. 5; 95 % confidence interval [CI 95 %], 0. 98 to 2. 30) and digital dermatitis (OR, 2. 08; CI 95 %, 1. 20 to 3. 61). Furthermore, higher levels of these conditions were also associated with the highest-level category of within-flock Campylobacter prevalence (70 to 100 %). These results could indicate that improving health and welfare may also reduce Campylobacter in broilers...|$|R
40|$|The European Union (EU) Broiler Directive (2007 / 43 /EC) {{is unique}} amongst current EU Directives, which address animal welfare, {{in that it}} uses outcome data {{collected}} at abattoirs and on farm to monitor on-farm broiler welfare and vary the maximum permitted stocking density on farm. In this study, we describe how, by bringing together personnel from the competent authorities in 22 member states (MSs) who have responsibility for implementing the Directive, and engaging in exchange of information and technical methods regarding the Broiler Directive, it has been possible to identify differences in approach with regard to ‘what data is being collected, and by whom’ across EU MSs. Online questionnaires and workshop exercises enabled us to identify priority areas for knowledge transfer and training. For example, foot pad dermatitis, hock burn, dead on arrival and total rejections (<b>birds</b> <b>rejected</b> as {{unfit for human consumption}} by the meat inspection staff at slaughter) were identified by the MSs as measures of medium-to-low priority in terms of knowledge transfer because there are assessment methods for these conditions that are already well accepted by competent authorities. On the other hand, breast lesions, cellulitis, emaciation, joint lesions, respiratory problems, scratches, wing fractures and a number of environmental measures were identified as having high priority in terms of knowledge transfer. The study identified that there is significant variability in the stage of implementation between MSs, and responses from the participating MSs indicated that sharing of guidance and technical information between MSs may be of value in the future set-up process for those MSs engaged in implementation of the Directive...|$|R
60|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{appears at}} first sight very bold, {{but when it was}} brought before the Entomological Society (33. 'Proceedings, Entomological Society,' Dec. 3, 1866, p. xlv. and March 4, 1867, p. lxxx.) it was supported by various statements; and Mr. J.

Jenner Weir's paper on Insects and Insectivorous Birds, in 'Transact. Ent. Soc.' 1869, p. 21; also Mr. Butler's paper, ibid. p. 27. Mr. Riley has given analogous facts in the 'Third Annual Report on the Noxious Insects of Missouri,' 1871, p. 148. Some opposed cases are, however, given by Dr. Wallace and M. H. d'Orville; see 'Zoological Record,' 1869, p. 349.) Three conspicuous kinds of caterpillars and moths were also given to some lizards and frogs, by Mr. A. Butler, and were rejected, though other kinds were eagerly eaten. Thus the probability of Mr. Wallace's view is confirmed, namely, that certain caterpillars have been made conspicuous for their own good, so as to be easily recognised by their enemies, on nearly the same principle that poisons are sold in coloured bottles by druggists for the good of man. We cannot, however, at present thus explain the elegant diversity in the colours of many caterpillars; but any species which had at some former period acquired a dull, mottled, or striped appearance, either in imitation of surrounding objects, or from the direct action of climate, etc., almost certainly would not become uniform in colour, when its tints were rendered intense and bright; for {{in order to make a}} caterpillar merely conspicuous, there would be no selection in any definite direction.|$|R
