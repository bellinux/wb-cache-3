5|$|Another {{proposed}} mission {{would have}} seen a Gemini spacecraft <b>rendezvous</b> with a Pegasus satellite in low Earth orbit. The spacecraft would have either been launched directly into an orbit to <b>rendezvous</b> with the Pegasus, or into a lower orbit, subsequently docking with an Agena, and using that to raise its orbit. The Gemini would have flown around the Pegasus, {{and then one of}} the crew would have performed an EVA to recover a piece of one of the spacecraft's micrometeoroid detection panels. This mission would have been used to prove that <b>rendezvous</b> could be accomplished with any spacecraft, to collect data on the satellite's exposure to micrometeoroids — supporting data that the satellite had returned itself, and to demonstrate technology for military flights to inspect hostile satellites.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{studies to}} grow the Mercury {{spacecraft}} capabilities to long-duration flights, developing space <b>rendezvous</b> techniques, and precision Earth landing, Project Gemini was started as a two-man program in 1962 to overcome the Soviets' lead and to support the Apollo manned lunar landing program, adding extravehicular activity (EVA) and <b>rendezvous</b> and docking to its objectives. The first manned Gemini flight, Gemini 3, was flown by Gus Grissom and John Young on March 23, 1965. Nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966, demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days, <b>rendezvous,</b> docking, and practical EVA, and gathering medical data {{on the effects of}} weightlessness on humans.|$|E

The bigger vessel stays at a fixed location (the <b>Rendezvousing</b> Point), while the smaller vessels go {{back and forth between the}} <b>rendezvousing</b> point and possibly a location close to the shoreline (the Beach Point).

The direct method is applied: the dangerous <b>rendezvouses</b> of the satellites are determined, and a {{probability of}} collisions under the dangerous <b>rendezvouses</b> is calculated. A density of {{distribution of the}} uncontrolled satellites coordinates and their orbital elements is obtained. A density of distribution of the directions {{and values of the}} relative velocities under dangerous <b>rendezvouses</b> of the geosynchronous satellites is also calculated...|$|R
40|$|Our current project {{focuses on}} the use of location-aware {{computing}} during social activities. The particular social activity we are investigating is <b>rendezvousing</b> (two or more people meeting at a time and place). A body of research [1, 2, 3] has identified <b>rendezvousing</b> behaviors through diary studies. Our focus is the integration of handheld technology and location-aware devices to aid in the act of <b>rendezvousing.</b> Most technologies (cell-phones, instant messaging clients, etc.) used for <b>rendezvousing</b> do not implicitly provide users with an awareness of location. The awareness of location comes from one person being able to textually or verbally describe a location to another. This is problematic as the communication of instructions or descriptions between persons may be ambiguous, misinterpreted or misunderstood. People may not even know their current location.

5|$|By 5:00am EST, Atlantis was {{trailing}} Mir {{by about}} 1,450 statute miles and closing {{at a rate}} of about 180 statute miles every orbit. A series of <b>rendezvous</b> jet firings later further refined the closing rate, leading up to a docking with Mir at 06:27:38UTC on 15 November.|$|E

5|$|Göring also placed {{emphasis}} on correct <b>rendezvous</b> with the bombers, {{which had been}} lacking in recent operations (see Adlertag).

For now, this would be the main tactical arrangement of fighter-bomber cooperation.|$|E
