Schizophrenia patients ’ mean monthly admission rates corre-lated with mean maximal monthly environmental temperature (R = 0. 35, N = 132 months, P < 0. 001). The present study may indicate that persistent high environmental temperature may be a contributing factor for psychotic exacerbation in schizophrenia patients and their conse-quent admission to mental hospitals...|$|E
40|$|Wetlands are the {{dominant}} natural source of methane release {{on a global}} scale. Estimates about the contribution of Arctic permafrost wetlands to the emission are still uncertain and need further assessment. A reason for that variability is the heterogeneity of the Arctic permafrost landscapes. They extend over large areas and are characterised by temporally and spatially varying environmental properties like land cover, surface temperature or soil water content. With chamber and tower measurements, exchange processes of matter fluxes have been determined for decades and have contributed {{to our understanding of}} the underlying processes. These results give an idea about possible changes in the future related to changing climatic conditions. For conclusions on a regional scale, however, these measurements cannot represent the true spatial variability of these fluxes, due to their local quality. Regional information about the fluxes, especially methane fluxes, is indispensable for assessing and predicting the climatic importance of the Arctic permafrost regions. To overcome this spatial limitation we use airborne measurements. During the Airborne Measurements of Methane Fluxes (AIRMETH) campaigns we conducted low level flights across the Mackenzie River Delta in Canada in the summers of 2012 and 2013. With statistical methods, the measured methane fluxes are related to <b>relevant</b> spatio-temporal <b>meteorological</b> <b>information</b> and surface properties derived from remote sensing products. Here we will show first results of the spatial variation of methane fluxes in the Mackenzie River Delta in 2013...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{exceptional}} heavy rainfall, in Chalkidiki peninsula-Greece, of 240 mm in a {{very short}} time period of 6 hours (380 mm in 24 hours) is analyzed. This area geographically located in the NW shores of the Aegean Sea, commonly has not the experience of frequent heavy rainfall events, and consequently the natural hydrographic network was not able to restrain this strong rainfall shock. Thus the result of the impact of this phenomenon was floods and damages in the properties of the residents with a very significant cost of hundredths thousands of Euros. This heavy rain phenomenon has been analyzed studying the role of the topography, the role of the nearby warm sea and the prevailing meteorological conditions resulting from the passage of the cold frond. This front was moving almost from south to north passing at first above the warm Aegean Sea surface, where it was supplied with huge amounts of water vapors, giving a total precipitable water value up to 32, 0 mm. Then the very humid air forced uplifting, due to the intense relief of the mountainous peninsula, resulting to this torrential rainfall. All the <b>relevant</b> <b>meteorological</b> data and <b>information</b> about atmospheric instability, instability indexes and precipitable water available arising to from five upper air stations and the synoptic charts of surface, 850, 700, 500 and 300 hPa were analyzed in order to describe in details this heavy rain phenomenon.

40|$|Climate modelers {{generally}} require <b>meteorological</b> <b>information</b> on regular grids, but monitoring stations are, in practice, sited irregularly. Thus, {{there is}} a need to produce public data records that interpolate available data to a high density grid, which can then be used to generate meteorological maps at a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. In addition to point predictions, quantifications of uncertainty are also needed. One way to accomplish this is to provide multiple simulations of the <b>relevant</b> <b>meteorological</b> quantities conditional on the observed data taking into account the various uncertainties in predicting a space-time process at locations with no monitoring data. Using a high-quality dataset of minute-by-minute measurements of atmospheric pressure in north-central Oklahoma, this work describes a statistical approach to carrying out these conditional simulations. Based on observations at 11 stations, conditional simulations were produced at two other sites with monitoring stations. The resulting point predictions are very accurate and the multiple simulations produce well-calibrated prediction uncertainties for temporal changes in atmospheric pressure but are substantially overconservative for the uncertainties in the predictions of (undifferenced) pressure.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to find the significant predictors for the demands of the health <b>meteorological</b> <b>information.</b> MethodsThis study used a descriptive design through structured self-report questionnaires. Data from 956 participants who were at least 18 years old and living in Busan, Korea, were collected from June 1 to July 31, 2009. The data was analyzed using a decision tree method, one of the data mining techniques by SAS 9. 1 and Enterprise Miner 4. 3 program. ResultsTwo hundred and ninety participants (30. 3 %) demanded the information, and 505 of them (52. 8 %) perceived the necessity of health <b>meteorological</b> <b>information.</b> From the decision tree method, the predictors related to the demands of the health <b>meteorological</b> <b>information</b> were determined as “the perception of the necessity of health meteorological information,” “the coping to the weather warnings” and “the importance of the weather forecasting in daily life. ” In Particular, the significant different variables in the perception of the necessity of health <b>meteorological</b> <b>information</b> were “female,” “aged over 40 ” and “environmental diseases. ” Thus, the model derived in this study is considered for explaining and predicting the demands of health <b>meteorological</b> <b>information.</b> ConclusionsIt can be effectively used as a reference model for future studies and is a suggested direction in health <b>meteorological</b> <b>information</b> service and policy development.

40|$|<b>Meteorological</b> <b>information</b> has obvious spatial-temporal characteristics. Although it is {{meaningful}} {{to employ a}} geographic information system (GIS) to visualize and analyze the <b>meteorological</b> <b>information</b> for better identification and forecasting of meteorological weather so as to reduce the meteorological disaster loss, modeling <b>meteorological</b> <b>information</b> based on a GIS is still difficult because meteorological elements generally have no stable shape or clear boundary. To date, there are still few GIS models that can satisfy the requirements of both meteorological visualization and analysis. In this article, a spatial lattice model based on sampling particles is proposed to support both the representation and analysis of <b>meteorological</b> <b>information.</b> In this model, a spatial sampling particle {{is regarded as the}} basic element that contains the <b>meteorological</b> <b>information,</b> and the location where the particle is placed with the time mark. The location information is generally represented using a point. As these points can be extended to a surface in two dimensions and a voxel in three dimensions, if these surfaces and voxels can occupy a certain space, then this space can be represented using these spatial sampling particles with their point locations and <b>meteorological</b> <b>information.</b> In this case, the full meteorological space can then be represented by arranging numerous particles with their point locations in a certain structure and resolution, i. e., the spatial lattice model, and extended at a higher resolution when necessary. For practical use, the meteorological space is logically classified into three types of spaces, namely the projection surface space, curved surface space, and stereoscopic space, and application-oriented spatial lattice models with different organization forms of spatial sampling particles are designed to support the representation, inquiry, and analysis of <b>meteorological</b> <b>information</b> within the three types of surfaces. Cases studies are conducted by (1) performing a visualization of radar data that is used to describe the reflectivity factor of a raindrop and the pressure field information acquired from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), and (2) taking cutting analysis as another example where advanced meteorological analysis is performed. The results show that the proposed spatial lattice model can contribute to the feasible and effective analysis of <b>meteorological</b> <b>information...</b>|$|R
