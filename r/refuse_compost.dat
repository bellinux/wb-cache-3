A field study was conducted in an Ultisol at Nsukka, southeastern Nigeria to investigate {{the effects of}} landscape slope positions and two organic waste residues (urban <b>refuse</b> <b>compost</b> and sewage sludge) on soil properties and cassava yield. The treatment consisted of two landscape slope positions, two organic waste residues, and a control; arranged in a split – plot design in RCBD. The two slope positions - mid slope (26 %) and toe slope (5 %) occupied the main–plot, while organic residues at the rate of 50 % inorganic nitrogen fertilizer requirement of cassava and a control were the sub-plot treatment. The result obtained from this study showed that slope position significantly (p 0. 05) higher at the toe slope position. However, percent survival was significantly (p> 0. 05) higher at mid slope position.

A greehouse pot bioassay was conducted to determine the percentage of short-term apparent bioavailable N of a highly matured <b>refuse</b> <b>compost</b> and its relative efficiency in supplying inorganic N to the soil-plant system in comparison with NH$NO$. Municipal refuse (after 165 days of composting) was applied at rates equivalent to 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 t ha ' to a ferrallitic soil from Tenerife Island (Andeptic Paludult). NH$NO$ was applied at rates equivalent to the total N content of the compost treatments. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was grown in 3 -kg pots and the tops were harvested at regular intervals after seedling emergence. The compost increased dry matter yield, soil mineral N, and plant N uptake proportional to the applied rate. These increases {{were significantly higher than}} the control at an application rate of 20 t ha '. After 6 months the apparent bioavailable N ranged from 16 to 21 %. The relative efficiency was 43 % after 30 days. This suggets that large inputs of inorganic N into soil can be obtained with high rates of this kind of compost, with a potential for NO$-N contamination. However, applied at moderate rates in our bioassay (< 50 t ha'), compost showed a low N-supplying capacity to ryegrass, i. e. {{a small fraction of the}} mineralized compost N was used by plants in the course of time.

There were also control plots which were not treated with any of the organic fertilizers. During the first 50 days crop period which followed the insecticide treatment, the chlorfenvinphos soil concentrations were always greater in the organic fertilizer-treated plots, than in the untreated ones (controls). The intensity of the organic fertilizers effect as to the increase of chlorfenvinphos soil persistence was in the following increasing order: city <b>refuse</b> <b>compost</b> < cow manure < mushroom cultivation compost. The organic fertilizer effects were greater when they had been soil-incorporated 3. 5 months-instead of 1 month-before the chlorfenvinphos soil treatment. The increase of the insecticide soil concentrations-due to the organic fertilizers treatments-should increase the plant protection efficiency during the period of the first 50 days, during which time the young plants are the most sensitive to insects. During the following period of the 2 or 3 last crop weeks, the effects of the organic fertilizers onto the rate of chlorfenvinphos soil metabolism were levelled off; at harvest, the very low soil-resting residues were similar in the organic fertilizers treated and untreated plots.

Recycling of domestic waste and composting of its organic fraction has been indicated as a possible disposal solution. A three-year experiment was conducted to quantify the minimum rate of urban <b>refuse</b> <b>compost</b> (URC) addition able to improve some physical and chemical soil properties at the lowest cost and environmental impact. URC was added to a silty clay soil and to a sandy loam soil 0 %, 3 %, 6 %, 9 % rate (w/w). Samplings were made 12, 24 and 36 months after URC application. To study the only effect of compost on soil due to its interaction with the soil matrix, each soil-compost mixture was divided into three boxes and kept outdoors weed free. After 12 months, 3 % URC resulted the minimum quantity able to ameliorate several soil properties. In silty clay soil this rate significantly ameliorated microaggregate stability and hydraulic conductivity, but negative effects were observed on electrical conductivity. After 24 months, 3 % rate significantly increased soil organic matter content. In the sandy loam soil, after 12 months, 3 % rate of URC determined {{a positive effect on}} organic matter and cone resistance in dry soil condition. Electrical conductivity increased at 3 % URC addition. The minimum URC quantity affecting hydraulic conductivity and plastic limit was 6 %, and 9 % for the liquid limit.

40|$|Abstract: The common housefly, Musca domestica and the green-bottle fly Lucilia {{species are}} Diptera {{belonging}} to the Suborder Cyclorrapha. The former species is associated with mechanical transmission of certain diarrhoeal diseases such as dysentery, typhoid fever, and cholera, which afflict man. Other important diseases include, anthrax, eye infections and bovine mastitis. It is {{the manner in which}} M. domestica exudes a “vomit-drop ” to sugar, dried blood, pus, excreta, sputum and other substances that makes it an efficient vector of human diseases. Bacteria may also adhere to the hairy body of the fly and to the hairy puvilli on the feet. Lucilia sp. is mostly associated with diseases of livestock such as sheep and fowls. This species causes myiasis of sheep called “strike”, which results in larval development in the skin. Usually, environmental sanitation involving elimination of fly breeding sites by proper disposal of <b>refuse,</b> manure, <b>compost,</b> human excreta and other waste is the fundamental measure for fly control. However, there are instances where control has to be supplemented with insecticides. Among the most commonly used insecticidal methods of control is the use of baits.

In all cases, the isotherms fitted the Freundlich sorption equation (x/m=KCen), generally with r 2 values greater than 0. 99. The value of the sorption constant K for the natural soil was 8. 81 for diazinon and 2. 29 for linuron. These values increased significantly for EOM modified soils with respect to natural soil, {{with the exception of}} the samples modified with SDS and LHA, in which cases they decreased, possibly due to the micellar properties of these compounds. Incubation of EOMs with soil increased their sorption capacity: the Koc values were increased proportionally to the incubation time for both pesticides and for all treatments carried out. Accordingly, the sorption capacity of hydrophobic pesticides increases with the degree of evolution in the soil of EOMs with humic type compounds, possibly due, among other causes, to the increase in the EOMs colloidal properties and the modifications occurring in the hydrophobic- hydrophilic characteristics of the soil surfaces. The main conclusion is that application to the soil of solid carbon rich wastes, especially those with a high degree of maturity, may offer an important strategy for reducing pesticide leaching, and for eliminating pesticide residues from soil with the use of liquid humic acids.

The experimental design included (i) preparation of the 15 N-labeled organic matter (city <b>refuse</b> <b>compost,</b> 640 g kg- 1 wheat straw and K 15 NO 3 composted for 80 days), (ii) a further 80 day incubation of a mixture of the labeled compost with a mineral soil (32 g kg- 1), (iii) measurement of stable isotope ratios, and (iv) isolation and structural comparison by 13 C and 15 N cross-polarization, magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of different organic fractions, i. e., soluble, colloidal (humic and fulvic type), and particulate (free organic matter and humin), from both the compost and the compost-treated soil. The results showed that the amide forms dominated in all of the newly formed N compounds, but an increased amount of alkali insoluble organic fractions was observed after incubation of the soil. The analysis of the insoluble, particulate fractions shows that nonextractable amides constitute the major pool of newly formed N compounds. The particulate soil fraction isolated by flotation in CHBr 3 -MeOH contained 16. 8 % of the total soil N and 26 % of the 15 N. The 13 C NMR spectra showed that the fulvic acid-like fraction (7. 6 % of the soil N, 8. 8 % of 15 N) consisted almost completely of a C=O-containing carbohydrate material, whereas the humic acid-like fraction (20. 3 % of the total soil N, 8. 6 % of 15 N) resembled an oxidized lignoproteic fraction containing the most significant aromatic domain. The water soluble fraction was, in both soil and compost, the one with the highest isotopic abundance of 15 N (96 %), but the 15 N NMR spectrum revealed minor amounts of soluble mineral N in this fraction and the remainder consisting of amide compounds.

40|$|Final full-text version (definitively {{accepted}} version) of {{the paper}} published by Elsevier Sci. Ltd. Land application of city <b>refuse</b> <b>compost</b> (CRC), produced from aerobic-thermophilic composting of the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes, is an attractive alternative for the disposal of these wastes, currently land-filled or incinerated. Knowledge {{of the availability of}} N in compost is particularly important, given the current concern about groundwater contamination by NO 3 [...] N. In this work we assessed the capacity of a CRC {{with a high degree of}} maturity to supply N to a barley crop over 2 months in a controlled-phytotron experiment. The CRC was applied at a rate equivalent to 60 t ha- 1, after incubation of the material (fraction < 2 mm) for 3 months at 24 ºC (40 - 45 % moisture). The soil (Eutric Cambisol) was labelled with 15 N as (15 NH 4) 2 SO 4 with 9. 614 atom % 15 N excess. Available-N from CRC dilutes the isotopic 15 N/ 14 N ratio of the labelled soil in an important way; atom % 15 N excess in the plant material (aerial part) after 2 months was approximately 50 % in the compost treatment with respect to the non-amended soil (0. 625 and 1. 201 atom % 15 N excess, respectively). Accordingly, CRC should not be considered as a poor-release N material when it has a high degree of maturity, i. e. it is highly biologically stabilised and "humified". On the contrary, a high N-fertiliser value to crops can be attained if a very high maturity degree is reached in commercial composting plants. This type of compost may be defined as a "postmature compost", a slow-release N material and a rich N material to plants at the same time. For this reason, the concept "postmature compost" is of great interest from an agronomic point of view and opens a wide portal for investigation of the agronomic reuse of composted organic materials.

One of {{the most}} obscure points in the {{biogeochemical}} cycle of productive systems is the structural transfomations of N-forms in organic fertilizers and soil humic substances (humic acids, fulvic acids and humins). In fact, wet chemical analyses leaves up to 50 % of the total N in compost and soil organic matter unidentified. This important methodological gap greatly limits the accurate molecular characterization of the N balance which is required for an efficient use of N from organic wastes and soil organic matter. The use of ' 5 N as tracer isotope {{is the only way}} to monitor that balance since it allows continuous monitoring of exogenous N-forms incorporated to native organic matter pre-existent in soil. In this work we have intended to identify the N-compounds in compost and soil through the following experimental approach: i) 15 N labelling fresh organic matter by incubation of a ' 5 N-enriched mixture of city <b>refuse</b> <b>compost</b> (30 %), wheat straw (64 %) and 15 NO 3 K (6 %) for 80 days. The starting C/N ratio of the mixture was set to 20, where just 50 % of the N was as 15 N, ii) the labelled compost (1. 6 g) was added to a soil free of organic matter (50 g), the moisture was adjusted to 66 % of the water holding capacity and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C during 80 days, iii) by using standard laboratory procedures, both compost and soil were divided into different organic fractions: (a) water soluble, (b) alkali-soluble, acid-insoluble (humic acids), (c) acid-and alkali-soluble (fulvic acids) and (d) insoluble extraction residue (humin). In the case of the soil, a light material (free organic matter (e), of a density < 1 g. cm- 3) and a particulate, low-density humin fraction (f) (floating on a 1. 8 g-cm- 3 CHBr 3 —MeOH mixture) were obtained from the amended soil and its final extraction residue, respectively. Finally, (iv) different physico-chemical characteristics of these fractions, including their 14 N/ 15 N ratios have been analysed. Their molecular characterization have been performed by using Curie-Point pyrolysis combined with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). The whole molecular assemblages of pyrolysis fragments yields a fingerprint, which is diagnostic of the original sample. The patterns in the Curie-point pyrograms at 510 °C are very different between the various soil and compost fractions and reflects their different origin and transformation extent. In particular, peaks arising from polysaccharides, proteins and lipids are predominant in the more labile fractions isolated from soil and compost (a,c,e). It is noteworthy the great differences between the pyrograms of the colloidal humic materials (b); those from the soil are dominated by aromatic compounds. The insoluble particulate organic matter (f) include a substantial polyalkyl domain. The most abundant N-bearing pyrolysis products were pyrroles, indoles, pyridin derivatives and nitriles, and were mainly identified in the more labile fractions (a,c,e). The progressive disappearance in the pyrolytic patterns of diagnostic structural units of plant biomacromolecules and pigments, in addition to the differences found in N-speciation, can be used as criteria to establish long-term residual effects of sustainable soil remediation practices based in periodic inputs of compost.
