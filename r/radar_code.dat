40|$|The NP-hard {{problem of}} {{optimizing}} a quadratic form over the unimodular vector set arises in <b>radar</b> <b>code</b> design scenarios {{as well as}} other active sensing and communication applications. To tackle this problem (which we call unimodular quadratic programming (UQP)), several computational approaches are devised and studied. A specialized local optimization scheme for UQP is introduced and shown to yield superior results compared to general local optimization methods. Furthermore, a monotonically error-bound improving technique (MERIT) is proposed to obtain the global optimum or a local optimum of UQP with good sub-optimality guarantees. The provided sub-optimality guarantees are case-dependent and generally outperform the π/ 4 approximation guarantee of semi-definite relaxation. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.

It is shown that mismatched filtering is often better than matched filtering in terms of estimation accuracy. A search strategy for finding general transmission codes that minimize estimation error and satisfy constraints on code power and amplitude range is then introduced. Results show that nearly perfect codes, with performance close to a single pulse with the same total power can be found. Also, finding these codes is not computationally expensive and such codes can be found for all practical code lengths. The estimation accuracy of the newly found codes are compared to binary phase codes of similar length and found to be better in terms of estimator variance. Similar transmission codes might be worth investigating also for sonar and telecommunications applications.

This is tantamount to jointly maximizing two quadratic forms under two quadratic constraints, so that the problem can be formulated in terms of a non-convex multi-objective optimization problem. In order to solve it, we resort to the scalarization technique, which reduces the vectorial problem into a scalar one using a Pareto weight defining the relative importance of the two objective functions.

Unit-modulus Least Squares (ULS) problems arise in many applications, including phase-only beamforming, phase retrieval and <b>radar</b> <b>code</b> design. These problems are NP-hard, so there exist problem instances that we cannot solve efficiently, and whether such solution exists remains elusive. ULS formulations {{can always be}} recast as Unit-modulus Quadratic Programs (UQPs), to which Semi-Definite Relaxation (SDR) can be applied, and is often the state-of-the-art approach (e. g., PhaseCut). SDR lifts the problem dimension and requires solving a much larger-scale convex problem, which makes it ill-suited for large-scale ULS/UQP. In this paper, we propose several first-order algorithms that meet or exceed SDR performance in terms of minimizing the cost function, and compare favorably to SDR in terms of runtime complexity. We establish convergence of the proposed first-order algorithms to a KKT point, and we demonstrate their superiority in two applications: beamforming using only phase-shifts, and phase retrieval...|$|E

30|$|Robust {{waveform}} {{design to}} resist uncertainty sets of target or clutter parameters (i.e., Doppler frequency, angle) has received considerable attention {{during the last}} decades [4 – 19]. According {{to the structure of}} radar systems, these works can be classified into two categories. The first one focuses on the robust design for monostatic radar systems. Specifically, in [4], the design of robust <b>radar</b> <b>code</b> under energy and similarity constraints is investigated to improve the worst-case signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over the possible target Doppler frequencies by using semidefinite programming (SDP)-related technique. In [5], the robust approach based on SDP and randomization with respect to the target Doppler is proposed to synthesize the radar waveform accounting for a peak-to-average-power ratio (PAR) and an energy constraint in order to the improvement of the worst-case SNR. For the detection problem of the extended target with the uncertain set on target impulse response (TIR), the robust transmit waveform accounting for constant modulus constraint and receiving filter have been designed jointly. In [6], considering worst-case SINR as the performance measure and assuming an interval of target Doppler shift are available, the robust design of transmit sequence and receive filter under energy and similarity constraints has been considered by exploiting related SDP relaxation. Considering the same criteria, the uncertain set, and waveform constraints, the related generalized Dinkelbach’s procedure [7] is developed to optimize radar waveform and doppler filter bank. For extended targets considering the uncertainties on the TIR and using the PAR and energy as signal constraints, in [8], a design procedure, based on SDP relaxation and randomization technique, is proposed to devise robust transmit code and receive filter aiming to improve the worst-case SINR. Assuming as figure of merit worst-case SINR, in [9], a max-min approach against the uncertainly sets of TIR for extended targets and the second-order statistics of the interference, is exploited to devise the waveform considering energy constraint.|$|E
