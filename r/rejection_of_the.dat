40|$|Furfural, {{found in}} the {{lignocellulosic}} prehydrolyzates at high concentration, is a strong inhibitor of growth and ethanol fermentation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Removal of furfural and concentration of monosaccharides were investigated by using two commercial nanofiltraton (NF) membranes with synthetic glucose-xylose-furfural solution as model. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> main operating parameters such as feed pH, permeation flux, temperature and feed concentration on <b>the</b> <b>rejections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three solutes, were studied. Results showed that <b>rejections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three solutes decreased with increasing feed pH and temperature, and increased with increasing permeation flux for both membranes. <b>The</b> concentrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three solutes had interaction effect on <b>the</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> furfural by NF 90 membrane and <b>rejections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three solutes by NF 270 membrane. Furthermore, <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> two filtration modes, concentration and diafiltration, on <b>the</b> separation <b>of</b> furfural from monosaccharides were also investigated. With the two commercial NF membranes, concentration and purification <b>of</b> monosaccharides in <b>the</b> model solution can be accomplished. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the m-type section was that at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, {{the response of}} the filter started to increase again, reaching a peak somewhere in the stop-band and then falling again. Zobel overcame this problem by designing hybrid filters using a mixture of constant k and m-type sections. This gave Zobel the advantages of both: the fast transition of the m-type and good stop-band <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constant k.|$|E

Amidst this crisis, Schaub decided to join the National Socialist German Workers Party, later commonly known as the Nazi Party; he became member #81.

5|$|Although not an isolationist, Coolidge was {{reluctant}} to enter into foreign alliances. He considered the 1920 Republican victory as a <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wilsonian position that the United States should join the League of Nations. While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, {{and he did not}} advocate membership. He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions. In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own. The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.|$|E

She seems to be a bit of an outsider to the corporate culture. Often she demands that Ted consider the horrible ramifications of the company policies or activities.

5|$|Glam metal lost {{mainstream}} {{interest in}} the early 1990s as the perceived excesses of glam metal created a backlash against the genre.

Glam metal has enjoyed a revival since the late 1990s with reunions of many popular acts from the genre's 1980s heyday, {{as well as the}} retro styling of newer bands including The Darkness from Lowestoft, the United Kingdom, Santa Cruz from Helsinki, Finland, and Steel Panther from Los Angeles, America.|$|E
