40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to establish dose-response and blood concentration-response relationships for <b>robenacoxib,</b> a novel nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with selectivity for inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 isoenzyme, in a canine model of synovitis. Acute synovitis of the stifle joint was induced by intra-articular injection of sodium urate crystals. <b>Robenacoxib</b> (0. 25, 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0 and 4. 0 mg/kg), placebo and meloxicam (0. 2 mg/kg) were administered subcutaneously (s. c.) 3 h after the urate crystals. Pharmacodynamic endpoints included data from forceplate analyses, clinical orthopaedic examinations and time course of inhibition of COX- 1 and COX- 2 in ex vivo whole blood assays. Blood was collected for pharmacokinetics. <b>Robenacoxib</b> produced dose-related improvement in weight-bearing, pain and swelling as assessed objectively by forceplate analysis (estimated ED(50) was 1. 23 mg/kg for z peak force) and subjectively by clinical orthopaedic assessments. The analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of <b>robenacoxib</b> were significantly superior to placebo (0. 25 - 4 mg/kg <b>robenacoxib)</b> and were non-inferior to meloxicam (0. 5 - 4 mg/kg <b>robenacoxib).</b> All dosages of <b>robenacoxib</b> produced significant dose-related inhibition of COX- 2 (estimated ED(50) was 0. 52 mg/kg) but no inhibition of COX- 1. At a dosage of 1 - 2 mg/kg administered s. c., <b>robenacoxib</b> should be at least as effective as 0. 2 mg/kg of meloxicam in suppressing acute joint pain and inflammation in dogs...|$|E
40|$|<b>Robenacoxib</b> {{is a novel}} nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug {{developed for}} use in cats. It is a highly selective COX- 2 inhibitor. Results from previous feline studies showed that, despite a short half-life in blood, the effect of <b>robenacoxib</b> persisted for 24 h in clinical studies. A tissue cage model of acute inflammation {{was used to determine}} robenacoxib's pharmacokinetics and its ex vivo and in vivo selectivity for COX- 1 and COX- 2 using serum TxB(2) and exudate PGE 2 as surrogate markers for enzyme activity, respectively. After intravenous, subcutaneous and oral administration (2 mg/kg), the clearance of <b>robenacoxib</b> from blood was rapid (0. 54 - 0. 71 L h/kg). The mean residence time (MRT) in blood was short (0. 4, 1. 9 and 3. 3 h after intravenous, subcutaneous and oral administration, respectively), but in exudate MRT was approximately 24 h regardless of the route of administration. <b>Robenacoxib</b> inhibition of COX- 1 in blood was transient, occurring only at high concentrations, but inhibition of COX- 2 in exudate persisted to 24 h. The potency ratio (IC(50) COX- 1 : IC(50) COX- 2) was 171 : 1, and slopes of the concentration-effect relationship were 1. 36 and 1. 12 for COX- 1 and COX- 2, respectively. These data highlight the enzymatic selectivity and inflamed tissue selectivity of <b>robenacoxib</b> and support the current recommendation of once-daily administration...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the cyclooxygenase (COX) selectivity of <b>robenacoxib</b> and its effect on mucosal recovery following ischemic injury in the horse. <b>Robenacoxib</b> selectivity was determined by assaying its EC 50 on COX- 1 and COX- 2 activity by measuring coagulation-induced thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated prostaglandin E 2 concentrations respectively. COX selectivity was defined as the EC 50 for COX- 1 divided by the EC 50 for COX- 2. Horses (n= 6) were anesthetized and jejunum was subjected to 2 hours ischemia. Control and ischemic-injured mucosa was placed in Ussing chambers and treated with Ringer’s solution (control), flunixin meglumine (2. 7 × 10 - 5 M) or <b>robenacoxib</b> (2. 7 × 10 - 5 M). Transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and 3 H-mannitol flux were measured over a 4 -hour recovery period. Bathing solution TXB 2 and prostaglandin E metabolites (PGEM) were measured to assess COX- 1 and COX- 2 function respectively. Histological injury grade and percentage epithelial denudation were determined. Results were analyzed using ANOVA, with a statistical significance of p&# 60; 0. 05. The EC 50 of <b>robenacoxib</b> for COX- 1 and COX- 2 was 11. 46 ± 4. 46 μM and 0. 19 ± 0. 07 μM respectively, resulting in a COX selectivity ratio of 61. 01. TER of ischemic-injured jejunum treated with flunixin meglumine was significantly lower than that of control and <b>robenacoxib</b> treatment. Ischemic injury significantly increased grade of histological damage, and percentage epithelial denudation. There was no significant effect of treatment. There was a significant increase in PGEM and TXB 2 in control and robenacoxib-treated tissues but not flunixin meglumine-treated tissues. <b>Robenacoxib</b> selectively inhibits COX- 2 and allows recovery of barrier function in ischemic-injured equine jejunum in-vitro...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Robenacoxib</b> is a {{novel and}} highly {{selective}} inhibitor of COX- 2 in dogs and cats and because of its acidic nature is regarded as being tissue-selective. Thirty four dogs with stifle osteoarthritis secondary to failure of the cranial cruciate ligament were recruited into this study. Lameness, radiographic features, synovial cytology and C-reactive protein concentrations in serum and synovial fluid were assessed before and 28 days after commencing a course of <b>Robenacoxib</b> at a dose of 1 mg/kg SID. Results: There was {{a significant reduction in}} the lameness score (P[*]&# 60; 0. 01) and an increase in the radiographic score (P[*]&# 60;[*] 0. 05) between pre- and post-treatment assessments. There was no difference between pre- (median 1. 49 mg/l; Q 1 -Q 3 0. 56 - 4. 24 mg/L) and post – (1. 10 mg/L; 0. 31 - 1. 78 mg/L) treatment serum C-reactive protein levels although synovial fluid levels were significantly reduced (pre- : 0. 44 mg/L; 0. 23 - 1. 62 mg/L; post- : 0. 17 mg/L; 0. 05 - 0. 49 mg/L) (P[*]&# 60;[*] 0. 05). There was no correlation between C-reactive protein concentrations in serum and matched synovial fluid samples. Conclusions: <b>Robenacoxib</b> proved effective in reducing lameness in dogs with failure of the cranial cruciate ligament and osteoarthritis of the stifle joint. The drug also reduced levels of C-reactive protein in the synovial fluid taken from the affected stifle joint. <b>Robenacoxib</b> appears to reduce articular inflammation as assessed by C-reactive protein which supports the concept that <b>Robenacoxib</b> is a tissue-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. </p...|$|E
40|$|Hepatoprotective {{effect of}} plant drugs against hepatic tissue injury induced by non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) was assessed on Beagle dogs. The {{adverse effects of}} carprofen and <b>robenacoxib</b> on the hepatic tissue were evaluated {{on the basis of}} histopathological examination of liver sections. It was demonstrated that the use of NSAIDs with liquorice and composed plant remedy Pectosol¯ caused a reduction of hepatic adverse effects induced by the administration of NSAIDs. This fact indicates a hepatoprotective effect of the tested plant remedies during the treatment with NSAIDs. However, the results require further studies on a larger group of animals. Liquorice and Pectosol¯ reduce the hepatic side effects, which develop after the treatment with carprofen and, to a lesser extent, <b>robenacoxib</b> in young Beagles. Such studies allow to investigate the negative and positive effects of using <b>robenacoxib</b> and carprofen in dogs and, therefore, help to limit the NSAID-induced side effects on the liver in these animals...|$|E
40|$|Objective-To {{determine}} the cyclooxygenase (COX) selectivity of <b>robenacoxib</b> {{and its effect}} on recovery of jejunal mucosa following ischemic injury in horses. Animals- 12 healthy horses. Procedures Half the maximal inhibition (EC 50) of <b>robenacoxib</b> for COX- 1 and COX- 2 activity was established in bloods samples from 6 horses via measurement of thromboxane B- 2 (TXB 7) and prostaglandin E- 2 concentrations, respectively; COX selectivity was subsequently calculated. Six other horses were anesthetized, and ischemia was induced in the jejunum for 2 hours. Control and ischemia-injured mucosa were collected and incubated with Ringer's solution (control treatment), flunixin meglumine (2. 7 X 10 (- 5) M), or <b>robenacoxib</b> (2. 7 X 10 (- 5) M). Transepithelial electrical resistance and mannitol flux were measured over a 4 -hour recovery period. Bathing solution TXB 2 and prostaglandin E metabolite concentrations were measured to assess COX- 1 and COX- 2 function, respectively. Results-The mean +/- SD EC 50 value of <b>robenacoxib</b> for COX- 1 and COX- 2 was 11. 46 +/- 4. 46 mu M and 0. 19 +/- 0. 07 mu M, respectively, resulting in a COX selectivity ratio of 61. 01. The transepithelial electrical resistance of ischemia-injured jejunum treated with flunixin meglumine was significantly lower than that of control and robenacoxib-treated tissues. A significant increase in concentrations of prostaglandin E metabolites and TXB 2 was detected in control and robenacoxib-treated tissues but not flunixin meglumine-treated tissues. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Robenacoxib selectively inhibited COX- 2 and allowed recovery of barrier function in ischemia-injured equine jejunal tissue in vitro...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{postoperative}} analgesic effects of <b>robenacoxib</b> and buprenorphine alone or in combination, in cats after ovariohysterectomy. Thirty healthy cats were randomly assigned to receive buprenorphine (0. 02 mg/kg, n = 10; GB), <b>robenacoxib</b> (2 mg/kg, n = 10; GR) or their combination at the same dosages (n = 10; GBR) SC. After 30 min cats were sedated with an IM administration of medetomidine (0. 02 mg/kg) and ketamine (5 mg/kg). General anaesthesia was induced with propofol and after intubation was maintained with isoflurane. Before premedication and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after extubation, pain and sedation were assessed using a simple descriptive pain scale, ranging from 0 (no pain/no sedation) to 4 (intense pain/ deep sedation). If the pain score was ≥ 3, rescue analgesia was provided using buprenorphine (0. 02 mg/kg) administered IM. Pain score was higher in GB at 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 h compared to baseline and compared to GBR at the same study times. Moreover, the pain score was also higher in GB compared to GR at 2, 3, 4 and 6 h. Pain score was similar at all study times between GR and GBR. Sedation at 1 and 2 h was higher than baseline values in all groups. Cats in GB received rescue analgesia more often than cats assigned to GR or GBR. <b>Robenacoxib</b> was an effective analgesic drug in cats up to 24 h after ovariohysterectomy. The addition of buprenorphine did not provide any additional analgesic effects compared to <b>robenacoxib</b> alone. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|When {{dogs with}} cancer {{are no longer}} (or not at all) treated for their illness, a palliative {{treatment}} {{should be given to}} increase the wellbeing of the dog. Dogs express pain in many different ways, sometimes by very subtle changes in behaviour. A brochure was created to inform owners about dogs that suffer from pain due to cancer and how to recognize this pain. A blinded cross-over study was performed on 6 dogs with untreated tumors comparing <b>Robenacoxib</b> and carporal as a palliative therapy. These two NSAIDs were compared using three forms (scoring pain, quality of life and adverse events), filled in weekly by the owners of the dogs. During 4 weeks every dog received either carprofen or <b>Robenacoxib,</b> they then had a wash-out period of one day without pain medication. Subsequently the other medication (either <b>Robenacoxib</b> or carprofen) was given during the next 4 weeks. When looking at the interim results, using a paired samples t-test and an independent samples t-test {{no significant differences between the}} two medications were found. Further research by examining more dogs is necessary to obtain more data. It is important to see whether or not a significant difference could be acquired between the medications in the future...|$|E
40|$|<b>Robenacoxib</b> is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} {{drug and}} a selective cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 inhibitor, registered {{for treatment of}} osteoarthritis and post-operative pain in dogs. In a randomized cross over investigator-blinded trial with client-owned dogs diagnosed with a form of cancer, we compare treatment with <b>robenacoxib</b> versus carprofen. Adverse effects (AEs), pain and Quality of Life (QoL) are assessed to determine which drug is the better choice in palliative management of the canine cancer patient. In the pain study, dogs were treated 28 days with one NSAID, had a wash out period of 1 day and were treated 28 days with the other NSAID. Physical examination and blood analysis were performed during a clinic visit every two weeks and every week forms assessing AEs, pain and QoL were filled out by the owner. This research project report discusses results of the first four patients participating in this pain study. Results in this paper are blinded, because of continuation of the study. The first patient showed no differences between treatments and only mild AEs and changes in scores, which were most likely caused by the effects of radiation therapy. The second dog survived 6 weeks and showed {{a difference in the}} two periods of the pain study, which may have been an idiosyncratic reaction of the dog to the NSAID secondly used. The third dog survived 3 weeks, thus was only treated with one NSAID; AEs and poor scores were most likely caused by progression of the tumour. The fourth dog showed no differences between treatments; AEs and changes in scores were most likely related to other causes than treatment. Recruitment of patients and use of the forms are discussed and recommendations are given for the continuation of the pain study...|$|E
40|$|Our {{objective}} was to evaluate the efficacy of <b>robenacoxib</b> in osteoarthritic dogs using four ordinal responses measured repeatedly over time. We propose a multivariate probit mixed effects model to describe the joint evolution of endpoints and to evidence the intrinsic correlations between responses that are not due to treatment effect. Maximum likelihood computation is intractable within reasonable time frames. We therefore use a pairwise modeling approach in combination with a stochastic EM algorithm. Multidimensional ordinal responses with longitudinal measurements are a common feature in clinical trials. However, the standard methods for data analysis use unidimensional models, resulting {{in a loss of}} information. Our methodology provides substantially greater insight than these methods for the evaluation of treatment effects and shows a good performance at low computational cost. We thus believe that it could be used in routine practice to optimize the evaluation of treatment efficacy...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The suppressive {{effects of}} nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) on the bone healing process have remained contro-versial, since no clinical data have clearly shown {{the relationship between}} NSAIDs and bone healing. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the compensatory response of canine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to several classes of NSAIDs, including carprofen, meloxicam, indomethacin and <b>robenacoxib,</b> on osteogenic differentiation. Each of the NSAIDs (10 µM) was administered during 20 days of the osteogenic process with human recombinant IL- 1 β (1 ng/ml) as an inflammatory stimulator. Gene expression of osteoblast differentiation markers (alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin), receptors of PGE 2 (EP 2 and EP 4) and enzymes for prostaglandin (PG) E 2 synthesis (COX- 1, COX- 2, cPGES and mPGES- 1) was measured by using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Protein production levels of alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and PGE 2 were quantified using an alkaline phosphatase activity assay, osteocalcin immunoassay and PGE 2 immunoassay, respectively. Histologic analysis was performed using alkaline phosphatase staining, von Kossa staining and alizarin red staining. Alkaline phosphatase and calcium deposition were suppressed by all NSAIDs. However, osteocalcin production showed no significant suppression by NSAIDs. Gene expression levels of PGE 2 -related receptors and enzymes were upregulated during continuous treatment with NSAIDs, while certain channels for PGE 2 synthesis were utilized differently depending on the kind of NSAIDs. These data suggest that canine BMSCs have a compensatory mechanism to restore PGE 2 synthesis, which would b...|$|E
40|$|Total mastectomy causes {{considerable}} {{tissue damage}} and a marked perioperative pain response. This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of epidural administration of 0. 5 % ropivacaine on pain management for mastectomy in dogs. Twenty client-owned dogs were enrolled and divided in 2 groups: Epi-group (received a single dose of 0. 5 % ropicavaine epidurally) and Mor-group (received morphine IM). All dogs were premedicated with 0. 3 mg kg 1 of morphine IM, anaesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol infusions. The volume of ropivacaine was calculated with a specific nomogram (Otero et al, 2010). Records of HR, fR, MAP, PE’CO 2 and SpO 2 were taken before and after epidural administration and throughout surgery. On recovery, dogs received 2 mg kg 1 of <b>robenacoxib</b> SC and were evaluated for pain score every hour, for 20 hours, using the Glasgow short form pain scale. Intraoperative rescue analgesia with fentanyl 2 lg kg 1 was administered if HR and MAP increased over 20 % from previous values. Postoperative rescue analgesia (morphine 0. 3 mg kg 1 IM) was administered with pain score higher than 5. Data were analysed with ANOVA tests and Tukey post hoc was used to evaluate data all over the time; a Friedmann test was used to compare pain scores. Values of p < 0. 05 were considered significant. No differences were detected between groups for age, weight and surgery time. All the dogs of Mor-group and three dogs in Epi-group required intraoperative fentanyl. Postoperative pain score was significantly higher in Mor-group (p = 0. 03) and the morphine requirement, over 20 hours, was significantly higher (p = 0. 004) for Mor-group (1. 4 0. 43 mg kg 1) compared to Epi-group (0. 76 0. 42 mg kg 1). Epidural administration of ropivacaine 0. 5 % was a good analgesic option and the nomogram to calculate the injected volume appeared satisfactory for this procedure...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess {{sedative}} and analgesic effects produced by the association of methadone and dexmedetomidine, administered intramuscularly as premedication for ovariectomy in cats. Twenty-four healthy cats were enrolled in the study. The values of heart and respiratory rate were recorded as Tbase. Cats received methadone 0. 5 mg kg− 1 and dexmedetomidine 5 mcg kg− 1 IM. Sedation and ease for catheterization were scored using a simple descriptive scale ranging from 0 (no sedation) to 3 (profound sedation) and 0 (very difficult) to 3 (very easy). General anesthesia was induced with propofol and after endotracheal intubation it was maintained with isoflurane. During the surgery Heart Rate (HR), Respiratory Rate (RR), hemoglobin oxygen saturation, Doppler blood pressure, expiratory isoflurane percentage and end tidal of carbon dioxide were recorded every five minutes. At the end of the surgery all animals received <b>robenacoxib</b> 2 mg kg− 1 subcutaneously. Recovery was scored using a simple descriptive scale ranging from 0 (poor) to 3 (excellent). The median sedation score was 2 (range 0 - 3); the only adverse effect associated with the premedication was vomiting occurred in 20 % of the cats. No animals became excited after premedication. The median ease for catheterization was 3 (range 1 - 3). After premedication HR and RR showed a decrease of 28 % and of 32 %, respectively, in comparison to Tbase values. The median recovery score was 3 (range 1 - 3). No animal required additional analgesia after the surgery. The association of dexmedetomidine 5 mcg kg− 1 and methadone 0. 5 mg kg− 1 employed in this study resulted in overall good sedation quality without any major adverse reaction. The onset of sedation was quite fast (about 7 min), suggesting synergic effect of the two molecules. Most of cats showed an easy catheterization and the recovery was excellent for the majority of cases...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{development}} of an adverse events (AEs) questionnaire for the registration and documentation of adverse events (AEs) in a clinical trial with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of pain in canine cancer patients. The aim of the research project is to assess the usefulness of <b>robenacoxib</b> in comparison to carprofen in the palliative treatment of canine cancer patients. The assessment of the treatment efficacy is done by scoring quality of life (QoL), pain and AEs. In literature, QoL scoring systems en pain scoring systems can be easily found (Lynch, 2010) (Iliopoulou, 2013) (Lavan, 2013). But in most clinical trials, AEs are recorded spontaneously or by interviewing owners (Edamura, 2012) (Vial, 2012) (Flor, 2013). We developed an AE questionnaire owners can fill out at home every week during the treatment period. The research question of this thesis is whether we succeeded in developing an AE questionnaire for the clinical trial with NSAIDs. During the development of the AE questionnaire another research question emerged. Namely, if the AE questionnaire might also be useful for owners with canine cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy at the Clinic of Companion Animals at the University of Utrecht. In order to create the AE questionnaire, a selection of expected AEs in treatment with NSAIDs was made. This selection is based upon the mechanisms of action of NSAIDs and the known AEs reported by the European Medicines Agency (European Medicines Agency, 2011). We adapted the VCOG CTCAE v 1. 1, a grading system for AEs observed during chemotherapy in cats and dogs (Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group, 2011). After translation and a first review, the developed questionnaire was tested twice. The first time its adequacy was tested in a group of canine patients without AEs. The second time its adequacy was tested in a group of canine cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. Based upon the first test, {{the final version of the}} AE was formed. Finally, owners of the second test group were asked for feedback on the AE questionnaire. In both tests, we find that owners think that the AE questionnaire we developed is clear and easy to fill out. The results of the survey reported that owners do not think that filling out the AE questionnaire is time consuming. But only 50 % (4 / 8) of the owners think the AE questionnaire has added value. In this study, we find that the AE questionnaire is adequate for the use in the research project with NSAIDs. However, we believe that the AE questionnaire should be adapted before it can be used in a clinical setting with canine cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy...|$|E
