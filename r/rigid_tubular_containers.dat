50|$|Pods, {{also known}} as guppies or simply tubes, are simply <b>rigid</b> <b>tubular</b> plastic <b>containers</b> which hold paintballs. The most common pod size holds about 140 paintballs; however, other sizes are available, and 100 paintball pods are common at rental sites, while there are also pods for smaller paintball pistols which only have the {{capacity}} of 10 paintballs (such pods are usually called tubes). Standard pods use a spring-loaded plastic top {{to enable them to}} be opened quickly and single-handedly. There are variations - for example, Dye Lock Lid pods which use a simple locking mechanism to ensure they won't open accidentally, or Syn Shockpods, which are engineered {{to be able to be}} shaken vigorously without the paint inside breaking. The oldest and largest manufacturer of pods is Allen Paintball Products in Ohio USA, they have been making paintball products since 1987.|$|R

5000|$|A pulsejet {{engine is}} an {{air-breathing}} reaction engine that employs an ongoing sequence of discrete combustion events {{rather than one}} sustained combustion event. This clearly distinguishes it from other reaction engine types such as rockets, turbojets and ramjets, which are all constant combustion devices. All other reaction engines are driven by maintaining high internal pressure; pulsejets are driven by an alternation {{between high and low}} pressure. This alternation is not maintained by any mechanical contrivance, but rather by the natural acoustic resonance of the <b>rigid</b> <b>tubular</b> engine structure. The valveless pulsejet is, mechanically speaking, the simplest form of pulsejet, and is, in fact, the simplest known air-breathing propulsion device that can operate [...] "statically", i.e. without forward motion.|$|R

It was of all-metal construction, with corrugated duralumin skinning over a duralumin structure, while its wing featured a distinct hump in the centre above the fuselage. The two prototypes had different wings, with the first prototype having a span of 29ft 0in (8.84m) and a wing area of 174sq ft (16.2m²), while the second had a span of 25ft (7.62m) and an area of 150sq dt (13.9m²). It was powered by a single 600hp (447kW) Packard 1A-2025 V12 engine with its radiator and oil tank in a <b>tubular</b> <b>container</b> beneath the fuselage.

50|$|Switches, circuit breakers, {{transformers}} {{and other}} apparatus may be interconnected by air-insulated bare conductors strung on support structures. The air space required increases with system voltage {{and with the}} lightning surge voltage rating. For medium-voltage distribution substations, metal-enclosed switch gear may be used and no live conductors exposed at all. For higher voltages, gas-insulated switch gear reduces the space required around live bus. Instead of bare conductors, bus and apparatus are built into pressurized <b>tubular</b> <b>containers</b> filled with sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas. This gas has a higher insulating value than air, allowing {{the dimensions of the}} apparatus to be reduced. In addition to air or SF6 gas, apparatus will use other insulation materials such as transformer oil, paper, porcelain, and polymer insulators.|$|R

Tension is applied to the elastic body for imparting strain. The movable shoulder can be advanced into abutting engagement with the sleeve, whereby the sleeve is placed in compression once the tensile forces are removed from the shanks. A reapplication of tensile forces equal to the initially applied tensile forces removes the sleeve from compression, whereby the sleeve is freed for rotation for thus indicating the magnitude of the applied tensile forces...|$|R

50|$|The Domani {{is built}} around a torsionally <b>rigid</b> <b>tubular</b> steel frame with {{structurally}} integrated sidecar unit. As mentioned above, the sidecar portion of the vehicle {{is an integral part}} of the frame. One of the advantages of this is that the frame is torsionally stiffer than that of a regular sidecar equipped motorcycle. Also, the suspension and layout for the two rear wheels can now be more car-like, with the sidecar's wheel being driven as well, making the vehicle a true rear-wheel drive. The unique frame also allows for aerodynamic fibreglass bodywork that wouldn't be possible in a traditional set-up. This in turn allows for some unique packaging of the components, for example the radiator is now mounted in the sidecar where it's better exposed to airflow. The aerodynamic skin also allows for the inclusion of a small luggage compartment in the back.|$|R

While dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (PC 16 : 0 / 16 : 0) is its main component, proteins and other phospholipids {{contribute to the}} dynamic properties and homeostasis of alveolar surfactant. Among these components are significant amounts of palmitoylmyristoylphosphatidylcholine (PC 16 : 0 / 14 : 0) and palmitoylpalmitoleoylphosphatidylcholine (PC 16 : 0 / 16 : 1), whereas in surfactant from the <b>rigid</b> <b>tubular</b> bird lung, PC 16 : 0 / 14 : 0 is absent and PC 16 : 0 / 16 : 1 strongly diminished.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recently, CT (CAT) {{scanning}} {{technology has been}} utilized to analyze snow and ice samples. To facilitate applying this technology to natural snow, a procedure has been developed that allows snow specimens to be transported from an outdoor location to the laboratory {{for the purpose of}} CT imaging. A snow sample is first obtained in a <b>tubular</b> <b>container.</b> A screen is placed beneath the container, and dimethyl phthalate cooled to a temperature just below O°C is slowly poured {{in the top of the}} snow. The wetting front moves downward, filling the pore space and expelling air out the base of the specimen. Packing the sample in dry ice freezes the substance in the pore space, protecting the snow microstructure and prohibiting metamorphism during transportation. The methodology presented is intended for CT imaging, which offers a nondestructive means to investigate grain structure and intergranular bonding, but is also applicable to surface sectioning. CT scans demonstrate that this technique provides adequate penetration of the dimethyl phthalate into the interstitial pores to prevent structural damage or metamorphism of the snow. Differences in X-ray absorption provide distinction between the ice grains and the dimethyl phthalate filled pore space...|$|R
40|$|Braided sleeve {{composite}} shafts {{are produced}} and their torsional behavior is investigated. The braided sleeves are slid over an Al tube to create {{very strong and}} <b>rigid</b> <b>tubular</b> form shafts {{and they are in}} the form of 2 / 2 twill biaxial fiber fabric that has been woven into a continuous sleeve. Carbon and glass fibers braided sleeves are used for the fabrication of the composite shafts.

Torsional behaviors of the shafts are investigated experimentally in terms of fabrication methods and various composite materials parameters such as fiber types, layer thickness, and ply angles. Comparing the two methods in terms of the torque forces and strain angles, the shafts producing entirely carbon fiber show the highest torque capacities; however, considering the cost and performance criteria, the hybrid shaft made up of carbon and glass fibers is the optimum solution for average demanded properties.

The {{distribution}} of fixed steel offshore platforms {{around the world}} reveal a global fleet that has exceeded or is approaching {{the end of its}} design life. In many operating areas, there is an attraction to continue using these aging facilities due to continued production or as an adjoining structure to facilitate a new field development or expansion. To justify continued operations of the fixed offshore platform, various integrity assessment techniques are often used. One of the major techniques used is the phenomena of Local Joint Flexibility (LJF). The substructure of a fixed offshore platform is generally made up of steel tubular members. These tubular members are connected at joints by thickened sections called joint cans. These joint cans are designed as <b>rigid</b> <b>tubular</b> joint connections however in reality tubular joints exhibit some degree of flexibility.

40|$|The Golgi {{apparatus}} is {{the assembly}} {{site for a}} number of complex enveloped viruses. Using high-preserva-tion methods for electron microscopy, we have detected two previously unknown maturation steps in the morphogenesis of Bunyamwera virus in BHK- 21 cells. The first maturation takes place inside the Golgi stack, where annular immature particles transform into dense, compact structures. Megalomicin, a drug that disrupts the trans side of the Golgi complex, reversibly blocks transformation, showing that a functional trans-Golgi is needed for maturation. The second structural change seems to take place during the egress of viral particles from cells, when a coat of round-shaped spikes becomes evident. A fourth viral assembly was detected in infected cells: <b>rigid</b> <b>tubular</b> structures assemble in the Golgi region early in infection and frequently connect with mitochondria. In Vero cells, the virus induces an early and spectacular fragmentation of intracellular membranes while productive infection progresses. Assembly occurs in fragmented Golgi stacks and generates tubular structures, as well as the three spherical viral forms. These results, together with our previous studies with nonrelated viruses, show that the Golgi complex contains key factors for the structural transformation of a number of enveloped viruses that assemble intracellularly.

40|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{consists of a}} reticulum underlying the plasma membrane (cortical ER) and ER associated with the nuclear envelope (nuclear ER). We used a Sec 63 p-green fluorescent protein fusion protein to study motility events associated with inheritance of cortical ER and nuclear ER in living yeast cells. During M phase before nuclear migration, we observed thick, apparently <b>rigid</b> <b>tubular</b> extensions emanating from the nuclear ER that elongate, undergo sweeping motions along the cell cortex, and shorten. Two findings support a role for microtubules in this process. First, extension of tubular structures from the nuclear ER is inhibited by destabilization of microtubules. Second, astral microtubules, structures that undergo similar patterns of extension, cortical surveillance and retraction, colocalize with nuclear ER extensions. During S and G 2 phases of the cell cycle, we observed anchorage of the cortical ER {{at the site of}} bud emergence and apical bud growth. Thin tubules of the ER that extend from the anchored cortical ER display undulating, apparently random movement and move into the bud as it grows. Finally, we found that cortical ER morphology is sensitive to a filamentous actin–destabilizing drug, latrunculin-A, and to mutations in the actin-encoding ACT 1 gene. Our observations support 1) different mechanisms and cytoskeletal mediators for the inheritance of nuclear and cortical ER elements and 2) a mechanism for cortical ER inheritance that is cytoskeleton dependent but relies on anchorage, not directed movement...|$|R

40|$|Chemists {{have created}} {{molecular}} machines and switches with specific mechanical responses that were typically demonstrated in solution, where mechanically relevant motion is dissipated in the Brownian storm. The next challenge consists of designing specific mechanisms {{through which the}} action of individual molecules is transmitted to a supramolecular architecture, {{with a sense of}} directionality. Cellular microtubules are capable of meeting such a challenge. While their capacity to generate pushing forces by ratcheting growth is well known, conversely these versatile machines can also pull microscopic objects apart through a burst of their <b>rigid</b> <b>tubular</b> structure. One essential feature of this disassembling mechanism is the accumulation of strain in the tubules, which develops when tubulin dimers change shape, triggered by a hydrolysis event. We envision a strategy toward supramolecular machines generating directional pulling forces by harnessing the mechanically purposeful motion of molecular switches in supramolecular tubules. Here, we report on wholly synthetic, water-soluble, and chiral tubules that incorporate photoswitchable building blocks in their supramolecular architecture. Under illumination, these tubules display a nonlinear operation mode, by which light is transformed into units of strain by the shape changes of individual switches, until a threshold is reached and the tubules unleash the strain energy. The operation of this wholly synthetic and stripped-down system compares to the conformational wave by which cellular microtubules disassemble. Additionally, atomistic simulations provide molecular insight into how strain accumulates to induce destabilization.
