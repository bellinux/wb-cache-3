2500|$|There {{are some}} methods {{to modify the}} heating value of {{produced}} LNG to the desired level. [...] For the purpose of increasing the heating value, injecting propane and butane is a solution. [...] For the purpose of decreasing heating value, nitrogen injecting and extracting butane and propane are proved solutions. [...] Blending with gas or LNG can be a solutions; however all of these solutions while theoretically viable can be costly and logistically difficult to manage in large scale. Lean LNG price in terms of mmbtu is [...] lower to the <b>rich</b> <b>LNG</b> price.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, three {{interacting}} technological developments have revolutionized {{the production of}} natural gas resulting in a much expanded supply and much lower price. These technologies are hydraulic fracturing, directional drilling, and the worldwide build-out of liquefied natural gas (LNG) import and export facilities. Hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling are mainly responsible for the improvement in supply, while the <b>richer</b> <b>LNG</b> infrastructure is facilitating the worldwide transportation of gas and starting to knit the once fractured gas market into a truly world market. The consequences of these processes has dramatically different effects around the world, creating true winners and losers. This article assesses {{the impact of these}} natural gas developments on the worldâ€™s ten largest economies. It concludes that the United States is the largest beneficiary of these developments, followed by China, with Russia being the largest loser in the new world of natural gas. I...|$|R
