50|$|Counter-{{scanning}} (CS) is a scanning {{method that}} allows correcting raster distortions caused by drift of the probe of scanning microscope {{relative to the}} measured surface. During counter-scanning two surface scans, viz., direct scan and counter scan are obtained (see Fig. 1). The counter scan starts in {{the point where the}} direct scan ends. This point is called the coincidence point (CP). With the counter scan, the probe movement along the <b>raster</b> <b>line</b> and the probe movement from one <b>raster</b> <b>line</b> to the other <b>raster</b> <b>line</b> are carried out along the directions that are opposite to the movements in the direct scan. The obtained pair of images is called counter-scanned images (CSIs).|$|E

50|$|As in the illustrative example {{found in}} the {{presentation}} this description is derived from {{we are going to}} restrict our discussion to two dimensional signals. In the example we perform a set of convolutional operations between a general 2D signal and a 3x3 filter kernel. As the sequence of convolution operations proceed along each <b>raster</b> <b>line</b> the filter kernel is slid across one dimension of the input signal and the data read from the memory is cached. The first pass loads three new lines of data into cache. The OpenCL code for this procedure is scene below.|$|E
50|$|Counter-scanned images (CSI, CSIs) are a pair {{of images}} {{obtained}} during counter-scanning. During the counter-scanning {{it is possible to}} obtain one or two pairs of CSIs (see Fig. 1). Each pair consists of a direct image and the image counter to it. First, a conventional image is obtained called the direct image, after that a counter image is obtained by reversing the movement direction along a <b>raster</b> <b>line</b> and the movement direction from line to line of the raster. The direct image of the second pair is formed by the retrace lines of the direct image of the first pair. The counter image of the second pair is formed by the retrace lines of the counter image of the first pair. CSIs are intended for correction of distortions caused by drift of the scanning microscope probe relative to the surface under investigation. To implement correction, it is sufficient to have at least one common feature between the direct and the counter images. As compared to a single CSI pair, the use of two pairs requires twice as much memory and processing time {{but on the other hand}} it allows increasing precision of correction and reducing noise level in the corrected image.|$|E
5000|$|The {{character}} address increases linearly. When {{the chip}} signals horizontal sync {{it increases the}} row address. If the row address does not equal the programmatically set number of rows per character, then the character address is reset to the value it had {{at the beginning of}} the scanline that was just completed. Otherwise the row address is reset to zero and the memory address is continues increasing linearly. This causes the same sequence of character values to be re-read from the memory for each <b>raster</b> <b>line</b> of each character row, before the 6845 advances the memory address to the next character row and repeats the same pattern. Therefore, if a character occupies one [...] "word" [...] in the video buffer, a display of l lines and c columns of characters with s scan lines per character requires l × c words of memory to represent a full screen of characters but takes s times that many memory accesses to complete one refresh cycle (as each line of character words is repeatedly read s times before the next one is read). This means that character displays using the 6845, compared to all-points-addressable graphics displays of the same resolution, require much less memory but still require high memory bandwidth on the order of the bandwidth required for graphics. (A different video display controller that buffers one whole line of character data internally can avoid this repeated reading of each line of characters from the display buffer RAM, reducing the required memory bandwidth and allowing either slower, less expensive memory chips to be used, more time for a system CPU to access the memory, or a combination of both.) ...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} solve the above problems, a {{procedure}} of electronic correction for the thermal drift was developed. The idea of the procedure is successively to compare shifted current image with the reference image of the studied GeSi QDs array in time intervals (< 10  s), for which the array does not shift noticeably (> 5  nm), and to match these images. Accuracy of such matching can be evaluated as 5 – 10  nm. The ultimate lateral resolution of the scanning Auger microscopy images is determined by this value. Therefore, each <b>raster</b> <b>line</b> of the Auger map image was recorded for less than 10  s. Electronic correction of the probe position described above was performed after each <b>raster</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
40|$|Line {{primitive}} extraction {{is one of}} {{the most}} important processes at the low level stage of line analysis in document image recognition. This paper proposes a new interpretive model of line continuation and applies it to line primitive extraction.

The combination of these two features is the main contribution of this paper. Testing results of synthesized and real line images show that the proposed model performs well to separate X-type and T-type junctions and to group Ltype junctions.

40|$|Line {{drawing on}} {{discrete}} graphics {{devices such as}} raster video displays, plotters, and image printers {{is one of the}} fundamental operations in computer graphics. Real-time interactive applications or high speed image output (such as on a Postscript laser printer) may require line drawing speeds in the millions of pixels per second. Such demands, which are ever increasing, push the efficiency of line generation. For nearly thirty years Bresenham's algorithm has been the standard which subsequent efforts in line drawing have sought to surpass. This work can be broadly classified into three groups: parallel algorithms which divide line generation over multiple processing units; multi-point algorithms which output a fixed number of pixels in each iteration with fewer decision tests per pixel; and structural methods, including run-length algorithms, which identify periodic patterns in <b>raster</b> <b>lines</b> {{to reduce the number of}} decision tests or even to eliminate them.

40|$|A {{procedure}} for {{the separation of}} full-field photoelastic images for use with an automated polariscope is described. Regions of background in the image are identified thus producing the boundary of the model. The shear difference method {{is used to calculate}} the components of stress along all <b>raster</b> <b>lines</b> in the image using photoelastic parameters at the boundary points to calculate the initial values of stress. Algorithms were also used to evaluate the stress components along <b>raster</b> <b>lines</b> which did not contain boundary points. A plastic template was used to evaluate the efficiency of the boundary routine. It was found that it was able to identify edges to within approximately one pixel on screen. The complete {{procedure for}} stress separation was evaluated using a stress frozen disc in compression and a turbine slot. The values of stress found using the automated polariscope with the stress-separation procedure were found to agree well with theory and with results determined using the method of Tardy compensation and manual analysis. The automated polariscope was also used to analyze three-dimensional stress components along arbitrary lines of a 3 D model. A two-model slicing regime was used to analyze a strut subjected to a vertical load. This work was compared to results obtained by Frocht and Guernsey on an identical model machined from Fosterite and subjected to a higher load. Good agreement was found between the results for points away from the region of loading. Significant differences were found near to the load point, however.

40|$|Introduction Given {{a pair of}} stereo images, {{rectification}} determines {{a transformation}} of each image plane such that pairs of conjugate epipolar lines become collinear and parallel {{to one of the}} image axes. The rectified images {{can be thought of as}} acquired by a new stereo rig, obtained by rotating the original cameras around the optical centre. The important advantage of rectification is that computing correspondences, a 2 -D search problem in general, is reduced to a 1 -D search problem, typically along the horizontal <b>raster</b> <b>lines</b> of the rectified images. A good starting point to explore the literature on rectification includes [1, 5, 6, 8, 4, 9]. After reviewing some concepts related to the pinhole camera model and the epipolar geometry, we will discuss in detail the process of rectification. 2 Camera model and epipolar geometry We assume prior knowledge of the projective camera model, and of the epipolar geometry.

30|$|The imaging {{results show}} the {{availability}} and superiority of the proposed algorithm in real SAR imaging. It is demonstrated that all the sparse reconstruction methods can achieve the higher resolution images than PFA. The latter can merely obtain fuzzy images, especially when the observation angle is not perpendicular to the target scene. Although OMP and CoSaMP are able to achieve the high-resolution results, there exist some problems with these classic matching pursuit techniques. For instance, when the observation angle is 90 °, there is a distinct bright streak that appears {{on the edge of}} the target in the imaging result of CoSaMP. As indicated by the arrows in Figs. 4 and 6, CoSaMP shows <b>raster</b> <b>lines</b> over the target image at the central region, which will severely influence the recognition of target. In addition, OMP may result in outliers on the sides of the target, which are marked by white circles in each images. In comparison, the proposed algorithm overcomes such defects and performs much better under the same scenario.|$|R
40|$|A {{high-frequency}} resonant horizontal scanner and a linearly driven vertical scanner at {{display frame}} rates {{can create a}} 2 -D raster for video display.

Field work in the Catskills suggests that the prominent new NNE lineaments may be surface manifestations of normal faulting in the basement, and that it may become possible to map major joint sets over extensive plateau regions directly on the imagery.
