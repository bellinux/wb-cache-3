40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} a Traffic Aware Strategic Aircrew Requests (TASAR) Electronic Flight Bag application intended to inform the pilot of trajectory improvement opportunities while en route that result in operational benefits. The results of safety analyses and a detailed review of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulatory documents that establish certification and <b>operational</b> <b>approval</b> requirements are presented for TASAR. The safety analyses indicate that TASAR has a likely Failure Effects Classification of No Effect, and at most, is no worse than Minor Effect.

40|$|One of {{the major}} issues facing Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) {{integration}} into the National Airspace System (NAS) is pilot qualification. To date UAS flights are only conducted in special use airspace or with individual and non-standardized approval. The only printed pilot qualification requirements come from the 2008 Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Interim <b>Operational</b> <b>Approval</b> Guidance 08 - 0 I. Although this interim guidance is {{an important first step}} it is time to align UAS pilot qualification with the requirements for manned and model aircraft. UAS Operators and pilots could be incorporated into the NAS under current regulations that govern pilot qualification, by modifying the standards and classification currently used by the U. S.

40|$|Emerging {{applications}} of Airborne Separation Assistance System (ASAS) technologies make possible new and powerful methods in Air Traffic Management (ATM) that may significantly improve the system-level performance of {{operations in the}} future ATM system. These applications typically involve the aircraft managing certain components of its Four Dimensional (4 D) trajectory within the degrees of freedom defined {{by a set of}} operational constraints negotiated with the Air Navigation Service Provider. It is hypothesized that reliable individual performance by many aircraft will translate into higher total system-level performance. To actually realize this improvement, the new capabilities must be attracted to high demand and complexity regions where high ATM performance is critical. <b>Operational</b> <b>approval</b> for use in such environments will require participating aircraft to be certified to rigorous and appropriate performance standards. Currently, no formal basis exists for defining these standards. This paper provides a context for defining the performance basis for 4 D-ASAS operations. The trajectory constraints to be met by the aircraft are defined, categorized, and assessed for performance requirements. A proposed extension of the existing Required Navigation Performance (RNP) construct into a dynamic standard (Dynamic RNP) is outlined. Sample data is presented from an ongoing high-fidelity batch simulation series that is characterizing the performance of an advanced 4 D-ASAS application.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to improve pilot {{understanding}} of the Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) by changing the Traffic Situation Display (TSD). This is supported by two objectives. The first objective {{is to create an}} integrated, realistic air traffic environment. This serves as an experimental platform for testing and evaluating future TCAS TSDs. The simulator environment includes a desktop flight simulator, background air traffic simulator, and intruder aircraft. The intruder aircraft uses seven dimensional waypoints to robustly follow trajectories and cause specific resolution advisories. Second, the relative benefits of, and potential concerns with, new TCAS TSDs are explored using a structured, iterative design process with subject matter ex- perts (SMEs). Incremental changes to the TSD were implemented into the simulator environment. SMEs evaluated the displays and potential points of confusion were identified. Several display features are discussed and implemented for future evaluations. These include boundary lines of TCAS variables depicted on the TSD and on a vertical situation display, speed lines which vary with the TCAS estimate of time to closest point of approach, and a prediction of the safe altitude target during a resolution advisory. Scenarios which may be confusing or misleading are discussed. These scenarios may be ameliorated or exacerbated by display features. This information is useful to guide both design and certification or <b>operational</b> <b>approval</b> and is a starting place for future TCAS experiments.

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{learning}} analytics {{as a means}} to improve student learning outcomes means that student data is being collected, analyzed, and applied in previously unforeseen ways. As the use of this data continues to shape academic and support interventions, there is increasing need for ethical reflection on <b>operational</b> <b>approvals</b> for learning analytics research. Though there are clear processes for vetting studies resulting in publication of student-gathered data, there is little comparable oversight of internally generated student-focused research. Increasingly, ethical concerns about the collection and harvesting of student data have been raised, but there is no clear indication how to address or oversee these ethical concerns. In addition, staff members who are not typical researchers may be less familiar with approvals processes and the need to demonstrate potential for harm, etc. If current trends point to a range of individuals harvesting and analyzing student data (mostly without students' informed consent or knowledge), how can the real danger of unethical behavior be curbed to mitigate the risk of unintended consequences? A systematic appraisal of the policy frameworks and processes of ethical review at three research institutions (namely, the University of South Africa, the Open University in the United Kingdom, and Indiana University in the United States) provides an opportunity to compare practices, values, and priorities.

40|$|In April 2006, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) crashed near Nogales, Arizona. This {{incident}} triggered one of {{the most}} sustained studies into the causes of failure involving Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) together with the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency under the Department of Homeland Security identified many lessons from this mishap. The following pages use the insights provided from the Nogales crash to support a critical review of the most recent FAA guidance on the integration of UAS into the U. S. National Airspace System. The existing version of FAA’s Interim <b>Operational</b> <b>Approval</b> Guidance 08 - 01 addresses many of the problems identified in the NTSB report into this incident. However, we conclude that greater oversight is needed to support the exemptions that are permitted for the provisions within this document. In particular, our analysis questions whether a process that enables the same agency to act as regulator and operator of a UAV can be justified within the National Airspace System especially when Federal Agencies delegate operational responsibility to sub-contractors. It is also argued that the Nogales crash illustrates the need for greater coordination between UAS operational staff and Air Traffic Management in order to improve mutual situation awareness under normal operations but also to support coordination under degraded modes. Finally, it is argued that the existing requirements for the certification of maintenance technicians and of maintenance management processes under FAA 08 - 01 should be strengthened beyond those for conventional aviation to avoid the sense of complacency that undermines the safety of UAV operations within the National Airspace System...|$|R
40|$|Required Navigation Performance (RNP) {{instrument}} procedures guarantee {{high levels}} of navigation precision through highly accurate navigation sources (e. g. GPS) and real-time monitoring of position estimation accuracy. In recent years, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has developed and published public RNP approach procedures at airports across the country. These RNP procedures offer unique capabilities such as curved segments (radius-to-fix, or RF legs), narrow containment areas, and constant descent profiles that are not seen combined in other categories of instrument approaches. Because of these capabilities, RNP approaches are regarded as highly flexible procedures that can be designed to meet specific stakeholder requirements (e. g. lower minimums in mountainous areas, minimizing fuel bum during approach, avoiding flight over populated areas for noise abatement, etc.) at the airport level. Among the various proposed benefits of RNP approaches, this study analyzed potential safety benefits related to improvements in approach stability. In total, 11, 062 individual approaches at four airports were analyzed using radar (ASDE-X) data, of which 364 (3. 29 %) were identified as RNP procedures. Of all approaches analyzed, two non-RNP cases were identified as unsafe, while there were no unsafe RNP cases. However, due to the relatively low number of RNP approaches observed, no statistically significant evidence of improved stability on RNP approaches was found. Given the low utilization of RNP approach procedures found from radar data, further work was done to identify barriers to operational use of these procedures and to investigate strategies to accelerate the adoption of RNP across the National Airspace System (NAS). Potential factors driving the low utilization of RNP procedures {{were found to be}} the low levels of equipage and <b>operational</b> <b>approval</b> among air carriers, and difficulties in air traffic management stemming from mixed equipage operations. by Sandro Salgueiro Rodrigues Filho.

40|$|To improve {{capacity}} {{and efficiency of}} the air transportation system, {{a number of new}} systems-level changes have been proposed. Key aspects of the proposed changes are combined functionality across technology and procedures and large physical scale of deployment. The objective of this work is to examine the current safety assessment processes for systems-level changes and to develop an understanding of key challenges and implications for the assessment and approval of future systems-level changes. From an investigation of current U. S. and international safety regulatory policies and processes, a general model was created describing key processes supporting <b>operational</b> <b>approval.</b> Within this model, a framework defined as an influence matrix was developed to analyze key decisions regarding the required scope of analysis in safety assessment. The influence matrix represents the expected change in levels of risk due to changes in behavior of elements of a system. It is used to evaluate the appropriate scope of analysis in safety assessment. Three approaches to performing safety assessment of systems-level changes were analyzed using the framework: the risk matrix approach, target level of safety approach, and performance-based approach. Case studies were performed using eight implemented and pending systems-level changes. In this work, challenges expected in safety assessment of future systems-level changes were identified. Challenges include the large scope of proposed changes, which drives a need for a broad and deep scope of analysis, including the multiple hazards and conditions and complex interactions between components of a change and the external system. In addition, it can be expected that high safety expectations will increase the required accuracy of models and underlying data used in safety assessment. Fundamentally new operational concepts are also expected to expand the required scope of safety assessment, and a need to interface with legacy systems will limit achievable operations. The large scope of analysis expected for future changes will require new methods to manage scope of safety assessment, and insights into potential approaches are discussed. by Roland Everett Weibel.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} Air Transportation {{is to move}} people and cargo safely, {{efficiently}} and swiftly to their destinations. The companies and individuals who use aircraft for this purpose, the airspace users, desire to operate their aircraft according to a dynamically optimized business trajectory for their specific mission and operational business model. In current operations, the dynamic optimization of business trajectories is limited by constraints built into operations in the National Airspace System (NAS) for reasons of safety and operational needs of the air navigation service providers. NASA has been developing and testing means to overcome many of these constraints and permit operations to be conducted closer to the airspace user's changing business trajectory as conditions unfold {{before and during the}} flight. A roadmap of logical steps progressing toward increased user autonomy is proposed, beginning with NASA's Traffic Aware Strategic Aircrew Requests (TASAR) concept that enables flight crews to make informed, deconflicted flight-optimization requests to air traffic control. These steps include the use of data communications for route change requests and approvals, integration with time-based arrival flow management processes under development by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), increased user authority for defining and modifying downstream, strategic portions of the trajectory, and ultimately application of self-separation. This progression takes advantage of existing FAA NextGen programs and RTCA standards development, and it is designed to minimize the number of hardware upgrades required of airspace users to take advantage of these advanced capabilities to achieve dynamically optimized business trajectories in NAS operations. The roadmap is designed to provide operational benefits to first adopters so that investment decisions do not depend upon {{a large segment of the}} user community becoming equipped before benefits can be realized. The issues of equipment certification and <b>operational</b> <b>approval</b> of new procedures are addressed in a way that minimizes their impact on the transition by deferring a change in the assignment of separation responsibility until a large body of operational data is available to support the safety case for this change in the last roadmap step.

40|$|With an {{increasing}} {{amount of attention}} being paid to maternal mental health and the knowledge that maternal depression {{has the potential to}} adversely affect the breastfeeding relationship, the demand for appropriate breastfeeding support for mothers struggling with postpartum depression is on the rise. Using a hermeneutic phenomenological approach, the objective of this thesis research was to explore the lived experience of breastfeeding in women with postpartum depression to enhance understanding of what it means for these women to feel supported by registered nurses. 	After obtaining ethical and <b>operational</b> <b>approval,</b> recruitment began in September 2011 via the Saskatoon Postpartum Depression Support Program, a community wellness program offered by the Saskatoon Health Region. The researcher conducted in-depth, conversation-style interviews with five postpartum mothers. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and were analyzed according to emerging themes. 	The lived experience of breastfeeding with postpartum depression presented itself across interviews as overarching patterns, which are expressed by the following four themes: making the decision to breastfeed and having great expectations; learning the moves and wanting reassurance (establishing the breastfeeding relationship); breastfeeding in the dark (maintaining the breastfeeding relationship while trying to manage the symptoms of depression); keeping it under wraps and waiting it out (the issue of support). 	The mothers in this study valued the breastfeeding relationship when it went well; however, breastfeeding difficulties intensified symptoms of depression. Mothers who made the decision to breastfeed their infants needed ongoing support from healthcare professionals and loved ones to continue to breastfeed when faced with the debilitating symptoms of postpartum depression. 	This research concluded that women need increased anticipatory guidance to be prepared for the demands of motherhood. Women who are at risk for postpartum depression need appropriate treatment throughout the perinatal period and beyond. To these ends nurses must enhance their role as breastfeeding and postpartum depression educators across an extended perinatal period. Nurses should work along with other healthcare providers (midwives, social workers, physicians) to assess the effectiveness and appropriateness of prenatal classes as they are currently offered. Increased emphasis should be focused on newborn feeding and care for mother and baby postnatally in conjunction with prenatal preparation for birth itself. 	The issue of professional nursing support for breastfeeding must be explored from a sociopolitical context in order to determine if nurses have the cultural and institutional support they need to provide responsive care to mothers and babies. Enhanced support for breastfeeding certification among frontline staff is recommended. It is also recommended that staffing guidelines to decrease nurse-to-client ratios be implemented in order to give nurses the time needed to support mothers as they work through breastfeeding challenges (especially those mothers at risk for postpartum depression). Further, nurses need to enhance efforts to engage mothers and their families in a participatory manner so that knowledge gleaned results in responsive interventions...|$|R
