50|$|In 1936, the {{operation}} of H.P.42 aircraft from London to India via Bahrain had been stepped up to a twice-weekly frequency. In 1937, Bahrain saw the regular service of the Empire sea planes. The landing strip of these giants on the water was from where the marina club is located in Mina Salman today. From the 1950s, BOAC operated several services a week through Bahrain. These included weekly services to Karachi, Singapore, Hong Kong and {{three times a week}} to Sydney. 1950 was a significant year not only for Muharraq as an international airport, but also for Bahrain's own commercial aviation history. In this year, a new local airline, Gulf Aviation Company, was formed - the forerunner of Gulf Air. The company started with only one aircraft, a second-hand Anson Mark II, which was used initially on services to Dhahran. But within two years, the fleet had expanded to four de Havilland aircraft and DC-3s for use on a steadily growing network in the Persian Gulf. This established Bahrain as an international stage. It was easily the most modern and advanced airport in the Persian Gulf with a good <b>runway,</b> <b>control</b> tower, lighting, communication facilities and even restaurants. It began to attract other carriers such as Middle East Airlines, Air India, Air Ceylon and Iran Air - mostly operating Dakotas. In December 1961, a new passenger terminal opened at the airport. During 1970 - 1971, RAF Muharraq was scaled back and eventually closed. In December 1971, the airport opened new passenger facilities, which included a wide area that could accommodate four 747 aircraft. In 1976, the airport marked another significant first with the inauguration of supersonic flights, which saw the start up of regular BA Concorde service between London and Bahrain.|$|E

40|$|Rats {{sustaining}} {{damage to}} the superior colliculus in infancy or adulthood and sham-operated controls were tested on two tasks requiring visual orienting to 'unexpected' and 'expected' stimuli, respectively. Experiment 1 measured the distracting effect of novel visual and auditory stimuli presented while the animals traversed a familiar <b>runway.</b> <b>Control</b> rats oriented to the distracting stimulus and had lengthened running times on the trials where it was presented. Rats with lesions of the superior colliculus were less distracted {{by the appearance of}} unexpected stimuli than sham operated controls but the severity of this effect depended on modality, and on age at operation. Experiment 2 examined the same animals' ability to detect and respond to a small and expected light that appeared at randomly determined positions around the perimeter of a chamber while the rat was at the centre. Filmed records and analyses of response latencies and errors showed that at low stimulus intensities, the active exploration shown particularly by infant-operated animals resulted in performance that was superior to that of adult-operated animals and, {{at least in terms of}} error rate, sham-operated controls. It is concluded that unusual behavioural strategies can explain all the differences between the animals operated at different ages. There was no evidence that novel projections from the retina were responsible...|$|E
