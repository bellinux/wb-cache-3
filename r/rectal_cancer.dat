25|$|While {{the total}} mesocolic {{excision}} (TME) operation {{has become the}} surgical gold standard {{for the management of}} <b>rectal</b> <b>cancer,</b> this is not so for colon cancer. Recently, the surgical principles underpinning TME in <b>rectal</b> <b>cancer</b> have been extrapolated to colonic surgery. Total or Complete mesocolic excision (CME), use planar surgery and extensive mesenterectomy (high tie) to minimise breach of the mesentery and maximise lymph nodes yield. Application of this T/CME reduces local five-year recurrence rates in colon cancer from 6.5% to 3.6%, while cancer-related five-year survival rates in patients resected for cure increased from 82.1% to 89.1%.|$|E

25|$|Since IGFBP-3 is {{abundant}} in the bloodstream of healthy adults (typically 2–4nbsp&mg/L), and is largely stabilized by its complex formation with IGFs and ALS, {{it is unlikely that}} tumor-derived IGFBP-3 has a large influence on circulating levels. There have been many studies linking circulating IGFBP-3 levels to the presence, or risk, of various cancers, or to patient outcomes. but unequivocal conclusions have often been lacking. For example, high plasma IGFBP-3 levels were associated with a reduced prospective risk of colorectal cancer in women. but in a study including men and women, colon cancer risk was positively associated with plasma IGFBP-3, while there was no significant association for <b>rectal</b> <b>cancer.</b> A large systematic review concluded that circulating IGFBP-3 levels showed a modest association with increased risk for a number of cancers, but the results vary among sites.|$|E

25|$|Those with {{a family}} history in two or more first-degree {{relatives}} (such as a parent or sibling) have a two to threefold greater risk of disease and this group accounts for about 20% of all cases. A number of genetic syndromes are also associated with higher rates of colorectal cancer. The most common of these is hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome) which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer. Other syndromes that are strongly associated with colorectal cancer include Gardner syndrome, and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). For people with these syndromes, cancer almost always occurs and makes up 1% of the cancer cases. A total proctocolectomy may be recommended for people with FAP as a preventative measure due to the high risk of malignancy. Colectomy, removal of the colon, may not suffice as a preventative measure {{because of the high}} risk of <b>rectal</b> <b>cancer</b> if the rectum remains.|$|E
2500|$|Contact x-ray {{brachytherapy}} (also called [...] "CXB", [...] "electronic brachytherapy" [...] or the [...] "Papillon Technique") {{is a type}} {{of radiation}} therapy using X-rays applied close to the tumour to treat <b>rectal</b> <b>cancer.</b> The process involves inserting the x-ray tube through the anus into the rectum and placing it against the cancerous tissue, then high doses of X-rays are emitted directly into the tumor at two weekly intervals. [...] It is typically used for treating early <b>rectal</b> <b>cancer</b> in patients who may not be candidates for surgery. A 2015 NICE review found the main side effect to be bleeding that occurred in about 38% of cases, and radiation-induced ulcer which occurred in 27% of cases.|$|E
2500|$|In 1909 Debussy {{wrote that}} he had almost {{finished}} Roderick Usher's monologue: [...] "It almost makes the stones weep... {{as a matter of}} fact it is all about the influence of stones on the minds of neurasthenic people. The mustiness is charmingly rendered by contrasting the low notes of the oboe with the harmonics of the violin (a patent device of my own)." [...] Debussy had believed he had been subject to neurasthenia but around this time his doctor diagnosed him as suffering from the <b>rectal</b> <b>cancer</b> which was to kill him. According to Robert Orledge, [...] "Debussy began increasingly to identify with Roderick Usher, whose mental breakdown Poe had identified with the crumbling House itself." [...] Debussy made three attempts at writing a libretto. Only when he was satisfied with the third one did he produce a short-score draft of the music to the first scene and part of the second in 1916–17. He went no further with Usher before his death in 1918.|$|E
40|$|In {{families}} {{at risk for}} hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) that do not fulfill all clinical criteria for HNPCC, additional evidence is sought by testing cancer specimens for microsatellite instability (MSI). We investigated whether {{the location of a}} colorectal cancer (CRC) predicts the result of MSI-testing in these families. One hundred and seven patients suspected for HNPCC were offered MSI-testing. MSI-testing was positive in 6 / 7 patients with endometrial carcinoma and in 22 / 100 patients with CRC. Only one out of 22 (4 %) <b>rectal</b> <b>cancers</b> was MSI-positive, and in this patient no mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutation was found. Right-sided colon carcinomas {{were more likely to be}} MSI-positive (14 / 37 or 38 %), followed by left-sided colon carcinomas (7 / 4 or 17 %) (p < 0. 05), with 6 / 14 and 4 / 7 MMR gene mutations, respectively. The likelihood that a tumor would be MSI-positive was 3. 3 times greater for right-sided than for left-sided colon cancer (OR 3. 3, p < 0. 05). Microsatellite instability was 8. 1 times more frequent in colon <b>cancers</b> than in <b>rectal</b> <b>cancers</b> (p < 0. 05). The presence of MSI was independently related to fulfillment of the Bethesda criteria (OR 7. 0, p = 0. 01). In families with multiple cases of colorectal <b>cancer,</b> the <b>rectal</b> <b>cancers</b> are only rarely MSI-positive. This indicates that even in families with multiple colorectal <b>cancers,</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>cancers</b> are most commonly of sporadic origin...|$|R

2500|$|Debussy died of <b>rectal</b> <b>cancer</b> at his Paris home on 25 March 1918, {{at the age}} of 55. He {{had been}} {{diagnosed}} with the cancer in 1909 after experiencing bleeding, and in December 1915 underwent one of the earliest colostomy operations ever performed. The operation achieved only a temporary respite, and occasioned him considerable frustration (he was to liken dressing in the morning to [...] "all the labours of Hercules in one"). His death occurred {{in the midst of the}} aerial and artillery bombardment of Paris during the German Spring Offensive of World War I. The funeral procession made its way through deserted streets to Père Lachaise Cemetery as the German guns bombarded the city. The military situation in France was critical, and did not permit the honour of a public funeral with ceremonious graveside orations. His body was reinterred the following year in the small Passy Cemetery sequestered behind the Trocadéro, fulfilling his wish to rest [...] "among the trees and the birds"; his wife and daughter are buried with him.|$|E
2500|$|Debussy also {{planned a}} version of Shakespeare's As You Like It with a {{libretto}} by Paul-Jean Toulet, but the poet's opium addiction meant he was too lazy to write the text. Two other projects suggest Debussy intended to challenge German composers on their own ground. Orphée-Roi (King Orpheus) {{was to be a}} riposte to Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, which Debussy considered to [...] "treat only the anecdotal, lachrymose aspect of the subject.". But, according to Victor Lederer, for [...] "shock value, neither [...] tops the Tristan project of 1907 [...] According to Léon Vallas, one of Debussy's early biographers, its 'episodic character... would have been related to the tales of chivalry, and diametrically opposed to the Germanic conception of Wagner.' That Debussy entertained, if only for a few weeks, the idea of writing an opera based on the Tristan legend is quite incredible. He knew Wagner's colossal Tristan und Isolde as well as anyone, and his confidence must have been great indeed if he felt up to treating the subject." [...] However, nothing came of any of these schemes, partly because the <b>rectal</b> <b>cancer</b> which afflicted Debussy from 1909 meant that he found it increasingly hard to concentrate on sustained creative work. Pelléas would remain a unique opera.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with long-standing colitis {{carry an}} {{increased}} risk of colorectal cancer and are therefore enrolled in colonoscopic surveillance programs. It is presently not known if endoscopic surveillance of patients with colitis with a closed rectal stump after a subtotal colectomy is justified. Neither is it clear which of these patients might be at increased risk for <b>rectal</b> stump <b>cancer.</b> OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the risk factors for <b>rectal</b> stump <b>cancer.</b> DESIGN: This investigation is a retrospective descriptive case-control study. SETTINGS: This study was conducted at tertiary referral centers in the Netherlands. PATIENTS: Colorectal cancer cases associated with inflammatory bowel disease diagnosed between 1990 and 2006 were selected in a nationwide pathology archive. Patients with <b>rectal</b> stump <b>cancer</b> were selected from this group. The pathology archive was also used to identify inflammatory bowel disease controls matched for referral center with a closed rectal stump after subtotal colectomy, but without neoplasia. Follow-up started at the date of subtotal colectomy with the formation of a rectal stump. Demographic and disease characteristics were collected at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Hazard ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for factors associated with the development of <b>rectal</b> stump <b>cancer</b> with the use of univariate Cox regression analysis. End points were <b>rectal</b> stump <b>cancer,</b> end of follow-up, or death. RESULTS: A total of 12 patients with <b>rectal</b> stump <b>cancer</b> and 18 matching controls without neoplasia were identified. Univariate analysis showed an association between <b>rectal</b> stump <b>cancer</b> and primary sclerosing cholangitis, and disease duration until subtotal colectomy. LIMITATIONS: This study is limited by its retrospective design, and, despite being the largest series to date, it still has a limited number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for <b>rectal</b> stump <b>cancer</b> in a closed rectal stump after subtotal colectomy were primary sclerosing cholangitis and disease duration until subtotal colectom...|$|R
