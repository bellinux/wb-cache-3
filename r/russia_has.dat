5|$|Hydropower is {{the most}} used form of {{renewable}} energy in Russia, and there is large potential in Russia for more use of hydropower. <b>Russia</b> <b>has</b> 102 hydropower plants with capacities of over 100MW, making it fifth {{in the world for}} hydropower production. It is also second in the world for hydro potential, yet only 20% of this potential is developed. Russia is home to 9% of the world's hydro resources, mostly in Siberia and the country's far east. At the end of 2005, the generating capacity from hydroelectric sources in Russia was 45,700MW, and an additional 5,648MW was under construction. The World Energy Council believes that <b>Russia</b> <b>has</b> much potential for using its hydro resources, with a theoretical potential of about 2,295TWh/yr, with 852TWh being economically feasible.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} argued that authoritarian regimes, such as China and <b>Russia,</b> <b>have</b> {{attempted}} to export their system of government to other countries through [...] "autocracy promotion".

50|$|<b>Russia</b> <b>had</b> {{the most}} to gain out of the Triple Intervention. In the {{preceding}} years, <b>Russia</b> <b>had</b> been slowly increasing its influence in the Far East. The construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway and the acquisition of a warm-water port would enable Russia to consolidate its {{presence in the region}} and further expand into Asia and the Pacific. <b>Russia</b> <b>had</b> not expected that Japan would be victorious against China. Port Arthur falling into Japanese hands would undermine its own desperate need for a warm-water port in the East.|$|R

5|$|Although Australia {{does not}} have any nuclear power reactors, Pangea Resources {{considered}} siting an international repository in the outback of South Australia or Western Australia in 1998, but this stimulated legislative opposition in both states and the Australian national Senate during the following year. Thereafter, Pangea ceased operations in Australia but reemerged as Pangea International Association, and in 2002 evolved into the Association for Regional and International Underground Storage with support from Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, Japan and Switzerland. A general concept for an international repository has been advanced by one of the principals in all three ventures. <b>Russia</b> <b>has</b> expressed interest in serving as a repository for other countries, but does not envision sponsorship or control by an international body or group of other countries. South Africa, Argentina and western China have also been mentioned as possible locations.|$|E
5|$|Belugas {{were the}} first whales {{to be kept in}} captivity. Other species were too rare, too shy, or too big. The first beluga was shown at Barnum's Museum in New York City in 1861. For most of the 20th century, Canada was the {{predominant}} source of wild belugas. They were taken from the St. Lawrence River estuary until the late 1960s, after which they were predominantly taken from the Churchill River estuary until capture was banned in 1992. <b>Russia</b> <b>has</b> become the largest provider since it had been banned in Canada. Belugas are caught in the Amur River delta and their eastern coast, and then are either transported domestically to aquariums or dolphinariums in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Sochi, or exported to other countries, such as Canada. Most captive belugas are caught in the wild, since captive-breeding programs are not very successful.|$|E

5|$|Russia {{is one of}} the world's largest {{producers}} of energy, most of which it obtains from oil, natural gas and coal. The country's focus on those resources for production and export, which constitute 80% of foreign trade earnings, means it has paid little attention to renewable energy. Out of the 203GW of electric generation capacity that <b>Russia</b> <b>has,</b> 44GW comes from hydroelectricity, 307MW from geothermal, 15MW from wind and negligible amounts from other renewable sources. In 2009, the Russian energy industry generated a total 992TWh of electricity, 176TWh of which was produced by hydroelectric power stations. Some of Russia's hydroelectric power plants are outdated and are in need of additional investment, as shown by the accident at the Sayano-Shushenskaya HPP in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Russian forces {{temporarily}} {{occupied the}} Georgian cities of Zugdidi, Senaki, Poti, and Gori, {{holding on to}} these areas beyond the ceasefire. The South Ossetians destroyed most ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia and were responsible for an ethnic cleansing of Georgians. Russia recognised the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia on 26 August; in response, the Georgian government severed diplomatic relations with Russia. Russia mostly completed its withdrawal of troops from undisputed parts of Georgia on 8 October. In the aftermath, Russia's international relations were largely unharmed. The war displaced 192,000 people and while many returned to their homes after the war, 20,272 people, mostly ethnic Georgians, remained displaced as of 2014. <b>Russia</b> <b>has,</b> since the war, occupied Abkhazia and South Ossetia {{in violation of the}} ceasefire agreement of August 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} permanent members, each {{holding the}} right of veto on Security Council reform, announced their positions reluctantly. The United States supported the permanent membership of Japan and India, and {{a small number of}} additional non-permanent members. The United Kingdom and France essentially supported the G4 position, with the expansion of permanent and non-permanent members and the accession of Germany, Brazil, India, and Japan to permanent-member status, as well as more African countries on the Council. China supported the stronger representation of developing countries, voicing support for India. <b>Russia</b> <b>has</b> also endorsed India's candidature for a permanent seat on the Security Council.|$|E

5|$|The Norwegian–British–Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1949–52 was {{the first}} {{international}} scientific expedition in Antarctica. The expedition established its winter quarters at a base called Maudheim at 71°S, 11°W, and mapped much of western Queen Maud Land. During the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958), year-round stations were established in Queen Maud Land by Norway, the Soviet Union, Belgium and Japan. The Norwegian expedition continued with topographical mapping, while the others started geophysical and geological research. Norway's Norway Station was lent to South Africa following {{the withdrawal of the}} Norwegian expedition in 1960. South Africa later built the SANAE station, near the now-defunct Norway Station. The Soviet Union, and later <b>Russia,</b> <b>has</b> maintained continual operations, although it moved from Lazarev Station to Novolazarevskaya Station. Japan has been based at its Showa Station since 1957, except for a hiatus of a few years. Belgium closed its Roi Baudouin station in 1961, though it mounted limited operations in cooperation with the Netherlands in 1964–66. The United States established the temporary Plateau Station in 1966.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Russian Federation {{had one of}} {{the highest}} levels of {{psychiatric}} beds per capita in Europe at 113.2 per 100,000 population, or more than 161,000 beds. In 2014, <b>Russia</b> <b>has</b> 104.8 beds per 100,000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services. Persons who do not respond well to treatment at dispensaries can be sent to long-term social care institutions (internats) wherein they remain indefinitely. The internats are managed by oblast Social Protection ministries. Russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999, and their number amounted to 505 by 2013. The internats provided places for approximately 125,000 people in 2007. In 2013, Russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146,000 people, according to the consolidated data of the Department of Social Protection of Moscow and the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Russian Federation. It is supposed that the number of beds in internats is increasing at the same rate with which the number of beds is decreasing in psychiatric hospitals. Lyubov Vinogradova of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia provides the different figure of 122,091 or 85.5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection (internats) per 100,000 population in 2013 and says that Russia is high on Europe's list of the number of places in the institutions. Vinogradova states that many regions have the catastrophic shortage of places in psychoneurological internats, her words point out to the need {{to increase the number of}} places there and to the fact that the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia is forcing transinstitutionalization—relocating the mentally ill from their homes and psychiatric hospitals to psychoneurological internats.|$|E
