5|$|American Sign Language {{is growing}} in {{popularity}} among many states. Many people {{in high school and}} colleges wanting to take it as a foreign language, but until recently, it was not a creditable foreign language elective. The issue was that many didn't consider it a foreign language. ASL users, however, have a very distinct culture and way they interact when talking. Their facial expressions and hand movements <b>reflect</b> <b>what</b> they are conveying. They also have their own sentence structure which sets the language apart.|$|E
5|$|In her book, Folklore, Horror Stories, and the Slender Man: The Development of an Internet Mythology, Professor Shira Chess of the University of Georgia {{connected}} the Slender Man to ancient folklore about fairies. Like fairies, Slender Man is otherworldly, with motives {{that are often}} difficult to grasp; like fairies, his appearance is vague and often shifts to <b>reflect</b> <b>what</b> the viewer wants or fears to see, and, like fairies, the Slender Man calls the woods and wild places his home and kidnaps children.|$|E
5|$|Lights and Sounds is {{the fifth}} studio album by American rock band Yellowcard, {{released}} on January 24, 2006, in the United States through Capitol Records. Lights and Sounds is Yellowcard's first concept album, which was inspired to <b>reflect</b> <b>what</b> the band was feeling {{at the time of}} production and how they have matured in the process. Lights and Sounds also departs from the sounds on Yellowcard's previous album, Ocean Avenue (2003), which broke away from its pop punk sound to a more alternative rock album.|$|E

5|$|Scully brings Gibson to the hospital, {{where it}} is {{determined}} {{that he has the}} alien virus in his blood. The Black-Haired Man (Scott Eberlein) kidnaps him soon after, and brings him to the power plant. They find the alien, who attacks the Black-Haired Man but not Gibson, as witnessed by Mulder from outside the locked door. Mulder and Scully are ordered to not associate with the X-Files and are reassigned under Assistant Director Kersh. Spender is visited by The Smoking Man in his office. Mulder continues to work on restoring the X-Files, and is told by Scully that Fowley's report does not <b>reflect</b> <b>what</b> really happened. Scully tells Mulder that the alien virus DNA is also part of all human DNA, but in Gibson the DNA is active. In the power plant, Gibson is trapped inside with the alien, which sheds its skin, revealing the traditional grey alien form.|$|E
5|$|The blackmouth {{catshark}} is an active, generalist predator that feeds on both bottom-dwelling and free-swimming organisms. Its diet {{is dominated by}} decapods, krill, bony fishes (including lanternfishes, bristlemouths, dragonfishes, and moras), and cephalopods. The most significant prey species generally <b>reflect</b> <b>what</b> is most available in the environment, for example the shrimps Calocaris macandreae and Pasiphaea multidentata off southern France and the prawns Sergestes arcticus and Sergia robusta off the Iberian Peninsula. Juveniles consume a greater amount and variety of crustaceans than adults, including smaller types such as mysids and hyperiid amphipods. Adults favor relatively large fish prey and {{have been known to}} take other sharks and rays and smaller members of the same species. The importance of cephalopod prey across ages differs between regions. The stomachs of some {{blackmouth catshark}}s have found to contain pieces of animals too large for a single shark to overwhelm, suggesting that it may sometimes attack in groups. Scavenging has been infrequently documented, including of human refuse.|$|E
25|$|The odor {{of normal}} human urine can <b>reflect</b> <b>what</b> has been {{consumed}} or specific diseases. For example, {{an individual with}} diabetes mellitus may present a sweetened urine odor. This can be due to kidney diseases as well, such as kidney stones.|$|E

25|$|Beckett said of Endgame that Hamm and Clov are Didi and Gogo {{at a later}} date, at the end {{of their}} lives.

25|$|Assuming {{that these}} reconstructions {{accurately}} <b>reflect</b> <b>what</b> Hipparchus wrote in On Sizes and Distances, then {{this work was}} a remarkable accomplishment. This approach of setting limits on an unknown physical quantity was not new to Hipparchus (see Aristarchus of Samos. Archimedes also {{did the same with}} pi), but in those cases, the bounds reflected the inability to determine a mathematical constant to an arbitrary precision, not uncertainty in physical observations.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s, {{changes in}} {{lifestyle}} and serious epidemics like tuberculosis made {{the government of}} Canada interested in tracking the Inuit of Canada's Arctic. Traditionally Inuit names <b>reflect</b> <b>what</b> is important in Inuit culture: environment, landscape, seascape, family, animals, birds, spirits. However these traditional names were difficult for non-Inuit to parse. Also, the agglutinative nature of Inuit language meant that names seemed long and were difficult for southern bureaucrats and missionaries to pronounce.|$|E
25|$|In {{drafting}} the Irish constitution in 1936 and 1937, Éamon de Valera {{and his advisers}} chose to <b>reflect</b> <b>what</b> had been a contemporary willingness by constitution drafters and lawmakers in Europe to mention {{and in some ways}} recognise religion in explicit detail. This contrasted with many 1920s constitutions, notably the Irish Free State Constitution of 1922, which, following the secularism of the initial period following the First World War, simply prohibited any discrimination based on religion or avoided religious issues entirely.|$|E
25|$|Fred Donner {{has argued}} {{for an early}} date for the {{collection}} of the Quran, based on his reading of the text itself. He points out that if the Quran had been collected over the tumultuous early centuries of Islam, with their vast conquests and expansion and bloody incidents between rivals for the caliphate, there would have been some evidence of this history in the text. However, {{there is nothing in the}} Quran that does not <b>reflect</b> <b>what</b> is known of the earliest Muslim community.|$|E

25|$|Southern Television's logo is {{sometimes}} {{said to be}} a compass, what with the directional station name {{and the fact that the}} bottom point on the logo is longest – thereby suggesting a compass pointing south, in the direction of Southern Television's service area. However, the general consensus is that it is a star, named after the Southern Star and because Southern Television's final transmission showed the logo zooming off into the night sky. For the purposes of this article, the logo will be referred to as a star, to <b>reflect</b> <b>what</b> it is most popularly called.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, it {{is argued}} that the {{responsibility}} of learning should reside increasingly with the learner (Glasersfeld, 1989). Social constructivism thus emphasizes the importance of the learner being actively involved in the learning process, unlike previous educational viewpoints where the responsibility rested with the instructor to teach and where the learner played a passive, receptive role. Von Glasersfeld (1989) emphasized that learners construct their own understanding and that they do not simply mirror and <b>reflect</b> <b>what</b> they read. Learners look for meaning and will try to find regularity and order in the events of the world {{even in the absence of}} full or complete information.|$|E
25|$|In 1971 Konstantīns Raudive wrote Breakthrough, {{detailing}} what {{he believed}} was the discovery of electronic voice phenomena (EVP). EVP {{has been described as}} auditory pareidolia. Allegations of backmasking in popular music, in which a listener claims a message has been recorded backward onto a track meant to be played forward, have also been described as auditory pareidolia. In 1995, the psychologist Diana Deutsch invented an algorithm for producing phantom words and phrases with the sounds coming from two stereo loudspeakers, with one to the listener's left and the other to his right. Each loudspeaker produces a phrase consisting of two words or syllables. The same sequence is presented repeatedly through both loudspeakers; however, they are offset in time so that one when the first sound (word or syllable) is coming from the speaker on the left, the second sound is coming from the speaker on the right, and vice versa. After listening for a while, phantom words and phrases suddenly emerge, and these often appear to <b>reflect</b> <b>what</b> is on the listener's mind, and they transform perceptually into different words and phrases as the sequence continues.|$|E

500|$|With Lights and Sounds, Yellowcard {{broke away}} from their {{original}} pop punk sound to a more alternative rock album. The album is somewhat of a concept album, made to <b>reflect</b> <b>what</b> Yellowcard was feeling {{at the time of}} production. Ryan Key, in discussion of this, said that Ocean Avenue was about [...] "finding your place in the world" [...] and explained that Lights and Sounds was about [...] "realizing that you've gotten lost". The band has cited Radiohead's Kid A (2000) and Guns N' Roses' 1991 albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II as major influences for the album. Yellowcard also credit Aphex Twin, Mouse on Mars and Explosions in the Sky for inspiration, regarding the music sound in the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team learned—some nine {{weeks prior to}} the start of filming—of a diary containing Logue's original notes on his treatment of the Duke. They then went back and re-worked the script to <b>reflect</b> <b>what</b> was in the notes. Hooper said some of the film's most memorable lines, such as at the climax, when Logue smiles, [...] "You still stammered on the W" [...] to the King, who replies, [...] "I had to throw in a few so they would know it was me" [...] were direct quotations from Logue's notes. Changes from the script to reflect the historical record included Michael Gambon improvising the ramblings of George V as he signed away authority, and the decision in the opening scene to dress the Duke in an overcoat rather than regal finery.|$|E
