40|$|Thoroughly and {{systematically}} presents the state-of-the-art in the diagnostic uses of radiologic imaging and nuclear {{medicine in the}} diagnosis and management of infectious and inflammatory diseases Although our understanding of microorganisms has advanced significantly and antimicrobial therapy has become increasingly available, infection remains {{a major cause of}} patient morbidity and mortality. Imaging of infection and inflammation provides a classic example of radiology and nuclear medicine’s strengths as well as weaknesses in the discovery and diagnosis of disease. Fortunately, the weaknesses are subsiding as new studies and techniques point to better planning and precision in the use of single and combined imaging modalities. Diagnostic Imaging of Infections and Inflammatory Diseases: A Multidisciplinary Approach deals with the very latest developments in the use of radiologic techniques and modalities in the management of patients with a host of infectious and inflammatory diseases. Tremendously timely and useful, this innovative, multidisciplinary book covers a wide range of topics in three parts: PART 1 : Infections and Host Response Epidemiology of Infections in the New Century Bacterial Osteomyelitis: the Clinician Point of View PART 2 : <b>Radiological</b> <b>Imaging</b> <b>Radiological</b> <b>Imaging</b> of Osteomyelitis <b>Radiological</b> <b>Imaging</b> of Spine Infection <b>Radiological</b> <b>Imaging</b> of Soft Tissue Infections <b>Radiological</b> <b>Imaging</b> of Abdominal Infections and Inflammatory Disease <b>Radiological</b> <b>Imaging</b> of Vascular Graft Infection <b>Radiological</b> <b>Imaging</b> of TB and HIV PART 3 : Nuclear Medicine Imaging Nuclear Medicine Imaging of Infections: Techniques, Acquisition Protocols, and Interpretation Criteria Nuclear Medicine Imaging of Osteomyelitis: WBC, Monoclonal Antibody, or Bacterial Imaging?

40|$|Nonlinear dynamics, {{chaos theory}} and fractal {{geometry}} {{have been widely}} used to study biologic systems and there are many applications regarding using them in biomedical sciences. Fractal image analysis which provides a new approach to quantify the properties of images and describe them as fractal dimension and multifractal spectra is one of the novel methods to explore complex images in a scale-independent format as a whole. In this paper the fractal analysis of <b>radiological</b> <b>images</b> as a new diagnostic quantitative procedure has been introduced via different examples. Several mathe-matical methods for calculating the multifractal spectrum of <b>radiological</b> <b>images</b> are discussed.

40|$|Trauma Networks are {{currently}} founded in Germany to improve patient care of severely injured persons. To assure appropriate patient treatment {{in a short}} time, the transfer of <b>radiological</b> <b>image</b> data between the connected hospitals over the internet is an important method. This paper characterizes <b>radiological</b> <b>image</b> transfer patterns in a regional trauma network and analyzes various compression options. Within the “TraumaNetwork NorthWest” in Germany, the webbased platform “MedSix” was developed. MedSix is able to transfer DICOM-data quickly and easily between connected hospitals and can be directly connected to the local PACS. Audit data of the routine system between the 01. 01. 2012 and the 31. 12. 2012 were analyzed to identify typical characteristics of <b>radiological</b> <b>image</b> exchanges. Five different compression methods were compared by a simulation. MedSix {{has been used by}} 12 hospitals. 87 % of the transfers were uploaded within 15 min. Lossless compression is able to save about 50 % bandwidth. 82 % of the transfers have a data volume of less than 200 MB. Temporary accounts for nonregular users were used regularly. Most transfers were done from small to maximum care hospitals. It is feasible to substitute physical image exchange in a trauma network with electronic exchange of radiological images between the connected hospitals. Even large datasets are transferred within an acceptable time frame. Most transfers occur from small to large hospitals. The possibility of temporary accounts seems to be a key feature for the user acceptance...|$|E

The research {{made it possible to}} determine referential values in the method of digital analysis of a <b>radiological</b> <b>image</b> for the tibio-tarsal bone of the ostrich, following exposure to injuries. In the case of a computer-generated analysis of a <b>radiological</b> <b>image,</b> the optimal conditions for taking images were selected, along with their digital record and processing: 0. 096 mm/pixel, 256 greyness level (8 bits), and scanning in BMP (a bitmap that is an open format of raster graphics, a block of bytes, which describes an image pixel by pixel). The research was conducted on the rectangular-shaped (160 x 320 points) spongy bone taken about 80 mm below the articular surface near the proximal metaphysis. The research allowed defining parameters of the spongious matrix of the tibio-tarsal bone of healthy 14 -month-old ostriches. The average number of trabeculae on lines was 10. 41 mm 2 for both sexes, the average volume was 2. 21 %, the density of the trabeculation (the percentage of the surface covered with trabeculae) was 47. 44 % for both sexes and the average width of the trabeculae was 0. 23 mm.
