25|$|With the {{so-called}} Primary Chronicle, also attributed to Nestor, begins the {{long series of}} the Russian annalists. There is a regular catena of these chronicles, extending with only two breaks to the seventeenth century. Besides the work attributed to Nestor the Chronicler, we have chronicles of Novgorod, Kiev, Volhynia and many others. Every town of any importance could boast of its annalists, Pskov and Suzdal among others. In some respects these compilations, the productions of monks in their cloisters, <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> Herodotus, dry details alternating with {{here and there a}} picturesque incident; and many of these annals abound with the quaintest stories.|$|E
25|$|The next eleven poems {{relate to}} the loves of Sulpicia and Cerinthus. Sulpicia was a Roman lady of high station and, {{according}} to Moritz Haupt's conjecture, the daughter of Valeria, Messalla's sister. The Sulpicia elegies divide into two groups. The first comprises iv. 2-6, containing ninety-four lines, in which {{the theme of the}} attachment is worked up into five graceful poems. The second, iv. 8-12, consists of Sulpicia's own letters. They are very short, only forty lines in all; but they have a unique interest as being the only love poems by a Roman woman that have survived. Their frank and passionate outpourings <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> Catullus. The style and metrical handling betray a novice in poetical writing. The thirteenth poem (twenty-four lines) claims to be by Tibullus; but it is hardly more than a cento from Tibullus and Propertius. The fourteenth is a little epigram of four lines with nothing to determine its authorship. Last of all comes the epigram or fragment of Domitius Marsus already referred to.|$|E

500|$|The fungus is {{associated}} with Judas Iscariot because of the belief that he hanged himself on an elder tree after his betrayal of Jesus Christ. Folklore suggests that the ears are Judas's returned spirit, and are all that are left to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> his suicide. The common name of the fungus was originally [...] "Judas's ear", but this was later shortened to [...] "Judas ear" [...] and, in the late 19th century, shortened again to [...] "Jew's ear". Common names for the fungus which refer to Judas {{can be traced back}} to at least the end of the 16th century; for instance, in the 17th century, Thomas Browne wrote of the species: ...|$|E
500|$|The 25th piece came {{suitably}} Halloween-themed. Located on the Bowery, it {{exhibited a}} Grim Reaper riding a bumper car in circles to an elaborate light show, fog machine and Blue Öyster Cult's (Don't Fear) The Reaper. The accompanying audio guide offered a self-mockery interpretation, with Banksy stating that often [...] "the role {{of art is}} to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> our mortality," [...] implying that with this mounted art show that goes on [...] "for so long we wish we were dead already." [...] The site of the exhibit was once that of an antique shop, some remains of which were placed in a coffin that occupied the lot for months. This prompted other interpretations of the installations message, paying homage to the [...] "ghosts of Bowry," [...] as the antique store owner suggested.|$|E
500|$|The [...] lament [...] "Rheingold! Rheingold! Reines Gold!..." [...] (Das Rheingold Scene 4) is sung by the maidens {{at the end}} of Das Rheingold, as {{the gods}} begin to cross the Rainbow Bridge into Valhalla. It begins with the music from the greeting, but {{develops}} into what Ernest Newman describes as a [...] "haunting song of loss", which becomes increasingly poignant before it is drowned by the orchestral fortissimo [...] that ends the opera. [...] A slow version of the lament is played on the horns in Siegfried, Act 2, as Siegfried enters Fafner's cave to claim the gold—the lament, says Cooke, serves to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> the gold's true ownership. The lament is played spiritedly during the Götterdämmerung prologue, as part of the orchestral interlude known as Siegfried's Rhine Journey, [...] before a shadow falls across the music as it descends into the minor key of the [...] "servitude" [...] motive.|$|E

500|$|The {{real-time}} {{episode was}} broadcast on 22 June 2011 in Australia and on 20 July in the UK. It was watched by 408,000 Australian viewers upon its first airing, making Neighbours the highest rated show on digital multi-channels that night. In the UK, {{an audience of}} 1.30 million watched the episode. For his work on [...] "Episode 6188", Dutton earned a nomination for Best Direction in a TV Drama at the 2012 Australian Directors' Guild Awards. A TV Week website writer called the episode [...] "an edge-of-your-seat special", which was [...] "unmissable". The Sydney Morning Herald's readers gave the episode three out of five stars, while the paper's television critic, Andrew Murfett, commented [...] "The clock is omnipresent in tonight's 'real-time' Neighbours episode. The gimmick of the formatting – the episode unfolds in real time over an action-packed 30 minutes on Ramsay Street – means the clock appears almost every minute to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> what is a pressing deadline. It's a clever device for fans who have perhaps fallen {{out of touch with}} the folks at Erinsborough. In fact it's almost impossible not be at least mildly interested about the future prospects of Scott McGregor and Ashleigh Brewer in the aftermath of this 24-style ep." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{consider}} the Astronomica to be {{a work of}} erudition, elegance, and passion. Both Scaliger and Bentley praised Manilius's handling of numbers in verse, and the Harvard University Press later echoed this commendation when it wrote that Manilius [...] "exhibit great virtuosity in rendering mathematical tables and diagrams in verse form". The press also contended that the poet [...] "writes with some passion about his Stoic beliefs and shows much wit and humour in his character sketches of persons born under particular stars". Housman, however, calls the poet [...] "facile and frivolous", but also describes him as [...] "The one Latin poet who excelled even Ovid in verbal point and smartness". The poem (while metrically correct) has been noted for its peculiar diction and unusual word choices, although this {{is largely due to}} his unusual content, as well as a lack of a stylistic antecedent. In this regard, the classicist Arthur Woollgar Verrall argues that while [...] "at his best, Manilius may <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> Lucretius", the [...] "metre [...] has the regular and monotonous flow of the age". Jacobs, Monceaux, and others have attributed the Astronomica idiosyncrasies to Manilius's reported African origin; they argue that he wrote and spoke a form of Africitasa putative African dialect of Latin [...] "with strongly marked peculiarities of vocabulary, syntax, sentence-structure, and style"thus explaining the poem's quirks. But aside from the dubiously hypothesized presence of Africitas in the poem, M. Dorothy Brock argues that there is very little evidence that Manilius was from Africa.|$|E

[...] John Zebrowski of The Seattle Times gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "The movie is helped immensely by its cast, who carry it through some of the early, sluggish scenes. But this is Murphy's movie. Donkey gets most of the good lines, and Murphy hits every one." [...] Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote [...] "In an era when much on film seems old, Shrek seems new and fresh and clever." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post gave the film five out of five stars, saying [...] "Despite all its high-tech weirdness, it is really that most perdurable of human constructions, a tale told well and true." [...] Joe Baltake of The Sacramento Bee wrote that it [...] "isn't so much a fractured spoof of everything Disney, but actually a Monty Python flick for kids – kids of all ages". Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer wrote [...] "What gives Shrek its special artistic distinction is its witty and knowingly sassy dialogue, delivered by vocally charismatic performers whose voices <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> their stellar screen personae in live-action movies." [...] Lisa Alspector of the Chicago Reader wrote [...] "This romantic fantasy complicates the roles of beauty and beast, making it hard to guess what form a sensitive resolution will take."

500|$|... "All Around the World" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jenna Rubenstein of MTV {{thought that the}} [...] "fist-pumping club banger" [...] is a complete departure from Bieber's previous work, while Diadem Pambid of the International Business Times stated that the singer joined the [...] "'synth-pop' bandwagon" [...] along with Britney Spears, Chris Brown and Usher. Jocelyn Vena also of MTV stated that the song could have been recorded by Usher, due to its [...] "grinding, fist-pumping" [...] background. Entertainment Weekly columnist Ray Rahman gave [...] "All Around the World" [...] a positive review, and stated: [...] "a Euro beat worthy of The Wanted? The vocal swagger of Chris Brown? Lyrics smacking of One Direction? Check, check, and check, please!" [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect rated [...] "All Around the World" [...] five out of five stars, and commented that the track {{is not only a}} sequel to [...] "Baby", but is also [...] "a whole new level for pop itself." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator explained that the song {{is a good example of}} how Bieber is taking [...] "baby steps to 'swaggy' adulthood through the evolution of his music — keep the content G-Rated, but make the beat something the older club-going crowd can enjoy. So far, it’s working." [...] Amy Sciaretto of Pop Crush gave the track a mixed review, and deemed it as highly similar to the work of Spears, stating: [...] "If you told us this song was penned for Britney Spears for her last album Femme Fatale, we'd Believe it, because the computerized style and the thick vocal effects <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> recent Brit material. It's safe to say that 'All Around the World' is a club banger. And while we love Bieber, it's not our favorite song on Believe so far." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} sets Gravity {{apart from his}} {{previous}} releases, Lecrae stated that [...] "Obviously, there's more risk involved in terms of just making more mature music that's not as straight [...] explicit. it's dealing with bigger issues. People may have to think a little bit more. The production is a lot bigger and more advanced than it's been. Lyrically, as an artist, I think I've written {{some of the best}} lyrics I've ever written." [...] Lecrae provided insight into the album's concept during an interview with Family Christian, stating that [...] "Gravity is loosely based on Ecclesiastes and I think what Solomon was trying to do was bring some weight to life and that’s really what I want to do, to paint some sober pictures." [...] He described that [...] "there’s a sober picture of how it’s only {{for a short period of}} time, it’s short-lived, or that we still have Jesus. So that’s what I would call a weighty part, a gravitational pull to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> who we are in Jesus." [...] Billboard stated that Lecrae increased his level of production for Gravity and [...] "mixed reggae and soul influences with his signature brash sound." [...] AllHipHop described the album as opening with [...] "an influx of instruments like violin, drums, guitars". [...] "I Know" [...] was described as having one of the hardest beats on the album, while [...] "Mayday" [...] was considered one of the most [...] "organic" [...] sounding tracks. [...] "Violence" [...] was considered one of the most energetic tracks, and was described as [...] "caribbean-esque" [...] with a dancehall vibe. After the music video for [...] "Lord Have Mercy" [...] was released, an article in The Christian Post article compared the song to the Kanye West single [...] "Mercy", both in its title and musical style. The article elaborated that [...] "like Kanye West's song, [...] "'Lord Have Mercy' features slowed down sampled vocals for its chorus along with heavy bass and an overall dark tone."

[...] The character has also received positive attention from feminist critics; in her article [...] "12 Life Lessons 'Kim Possible' Taught Us That Are Still Pretty Relevant", Kadeen Griffiths of Bustle described Kim as an [...] "amazingly feminist" [...] character [...] "that taught girls that it was okay to overachieve, that worrying about boys didn't make you any less of a hero, and that you could invent your own slang and still sound (sort of) cool."

Comparing Kim to comic book superheroine Wonder Woman, Kathryn Shattuck of The New York Times wrote, [...] "MOVE over, boy wonders. The newest superhero on the block doesn't need a gimmicky mask or a jolt of testosterone to get the job done ... Kim Possible is ready and able to rescue humankind from evildoers without sacrificing her interest in boys and clothes." [...] However, in her book Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection, author Lyn Mikel Brown dismissed Kim as both a feminist and role model because of her alleged reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the observation that [...] "Her biggest threat is not evil, in fact, but the head cheerleader". Since her debut, Kim has proven herself a popular character among both girls and boys, although McCorkle admitted that [...] "whenever you have a girl in the lead doing all the action stuff, there’s a certain age group of boys who won’t admit they like the stuff. They really want to see the boy in that role." [...] McCorkle recalled an incident in which a fan of the show was very much surprised to learn that the writers were actually men upon meeting them; the fan had always just assumed that they were both young women because of the way in which they characterized Kim. At one point, fans of the character had sent her over one million e-mails via her interactive website.|$|E
