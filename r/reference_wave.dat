50|$|Alternatively, {{instead of}} {{operating}} {{with respect to}} a constant <b>reference</b> <b>wave,</b> the broadcast can operate with respect to itself. Changes in phase of a single broadcast waveform can be considered the significant items. In this system, the demodulator determines the changes in the phase of the received signal rather than the phase (relative to a <b>reference</b> <b>wave)</b> itself. Since this scheme depends on the difference between successive phases, it is termed differential phase-shift keying (DPSK). DPSK can be significantly simpler to implement than ordinary PSK since {{there is no need for}} the demodulator to have a copy of the reference signal to determine the exact phase of the received signal (it is a non-coherent scheme). In exchange, it produces more erroneous demodulation.|$|E

40|$|A {{reflection}} mode digital holographic microscope {{with light}} emitting diode (LED) illumination and off-axis interferometry is proposed The setup is comprised of a Linnik interferometer and a grating based 41 imaging unit. Both object and <b>reference</b> <b>waves</b> travel coaxially and are split into multiple diffraction orders in the Fourier plane by the grating. The zeroth and first orders are filtered by a polarizing array to select orthogonally polarized object <b>waves</b> and <b>reference</b> <b>waves.</b> Subsequently, the object and <b>reference</b> <b>waves</b> are combined again in the output plane of the 4 f system, and then the hologram with uniform contrast over the entire field of view can be acquired {{with the aid of}} a polarizer. The one-shot nature in the off-axis configuration enables an interferometric recording time on a millisecond scale. The validity of the proposed setup is illustrated by imaging nanostructured substrates, and the experimental results demonstrate that the phase noise is reduced drastically by an order of 68 % when compared to a He Ne laser-based result.

50|$|Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) is digital {{holography}} {{applied to}} microscopy. Digital holographic microscopy distinguishes itself from other microscopy methods by not recording the projected {{image of the}} object. Instead, the light wave front information originating from the object is digitally recorded as a hologram, from which a computer calculates the object image by using a numerical reconstruction algorithm. The image forming lens in traditional microscopy is thus replaced by a computer algorithm.Other closely related microscopy methods to digital holographic microscopy are interferometric microscopy, optical coherence tomography and diffraction phase microscopy. Common to all methods {{is the use of}} a <b>reference</b> <b>wave</b> front to obtain amplitude (intensity) and phase information. The information is recorded on a digital image sensor or by a photo detector from which an image of the object is created (reconstructed) by a computer. In traditional microscopy, which do not use a <b>reference</b> <b>wave</b> front, only intensity information is recorded and essential information about the object is lost.|$|E

50|$|The {{choice of}} the {{exponential}} ansatz is opportune because (unlike other ansatzes, for example, configuration interaction) it guarantees the size extensivity of the solution. Size consistency in CC theory, also unlike other theories, {{does not depend on}} the size consistency of the <b>reference</b> <b>wave</b> function. This is easily seen, for example, in the single bond breaking of F when using a restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) reference, which is not size consistent, at the CCSDT level of theory which provides an almost exact, full CI-quality, potential energy surface and does not dissociate the molecule into F and F ions, like the RHF wave function, but rather into two neutral F atoms. If one were to use, for example, the CCSD, CCSDT, or CCSD(T) levels of theory, they would not provide reasonable results for the bond breaking of F, with the latter two approaches providing unphysical potential energy surfaces, though this is for reasons other than just size consistency.|$|E
50|$|To {{test for}} a match, the {{reference}} impedance {{of the bridge}} is set to the expected load impedance (for example, 50 ohms), and the transmission line connected as the unknown impedance. RF power {{is applied to the}} circuit. The voltage at the line input represents the vector sum of the forward wave, and the wave reflected from the load. If the characteristic impedance of the line is known to be 50 ohms, we know the magnitude and phase of the forward wave; it is the same wave present {{on the other side of}} the detector. Subtracting this known wave from the wave present at the line input yields the reflected wave. Properly designed, a bridge circuit can be used not only to indicate a match, but the degree of mismatch - thus making it possible to calculate the SWR. This usually involves alternately connecting the <b>reference</b> <b>wave</b> and the reflected wave to a power meter, and comparing the magnitudes of the resulting deflections.|$|E
5000|$|The {{problem of}} {{computational}} expense can be alleviated through simplification schemes. [...] In the density fitting scheme, the four-index integrals {{used to describe}} the interaction between electron pairs are reduced to simpler two- or three-index integrals, by treating the charge densities they contain in a simplified way. This reduces the scaling with respect to basis set size. Methods employing this scheme are denoted by the prefix [...] "df-", for example the density fitting MP2 is df-MP2 (many authors use lower-case to prevent confusion with DFT). In the local approximation, the molecular orbitals are first localized by a unitary rotation in the orbital space (which leaves the <b>reference</b> <b>wave</b> function invariant, i.e., is not an approximation) and subsequently interactions of distant pairs of localized orbitals are neglected in the correlation calculation. This sharply reduces the scaling with molecular size, a major problem in the treatment of biologically-sized molecules. Methods employing this scheme are denoted by the prefix [...] "L", e.g. LMP2. [...] Both schemes can be employed together, as in the df-LMP2 and df-LCCSD(T0) methods. In fact, df-LMP2 calculations are faster than df-Hartree - Fock calculations and thus are feasible in nearly all situations in which also DFT is.|$|E
