25|$|Demosthenes's arrival {{provided}} little {{relief to}} the other Athenians. Their camp was located near a marsh {{and many of them}} had fallen ill, including Nicias. Seeing this, Demosthenes thought they should all return to Athens to defend Attica against the Spartan invasion that had taken Decelea. Nicias, who had opposed the expedition at first, now did not want to show any weakness either to the Syracusans and Spartans, or to the Athenians at home who would likely put him on trial for failing to conquer the island. He hoped the Syracusans would soon run out of money, and he had also been informed that there were pro-Athenian factions in Syracuse who were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the city over to him. Demosthenes and Eurymedon reluctantly agreed that Nicias might be right, but when reinforcements from the Peloponnese arrived, Nicias agreed that they should leave.|$|E
25|$|Eugene Figg’s {{lifetime}} was wrought with war, economic fluctuation, {{and infrastructure}} renovation. Born {{just two years}} after “…Hitler claimed credit and consolidated his position as a dictator…” (Meier, 2000) in 1934, Figg’s early years were spent in the United States' economic depression, The Great Depression. After the U.S.’s involvements with World War II in 1945, the economy was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> its attention to the returning troops. “To integrate millions of young veterans into the American economy, the 78th Congress passed the GI Bill of Rights on June 22, 1944.” (U-S-History.com) The GI Bill provided veterans low-interest rates {{and they were able}} to purchase homes and seek higher education, which sparked a movement into the Baby Boom generation as well as a move into the suburbs. With a growing number of children, more schools had to be built (U-S-History.com), as well the transportation systems of the suburb communities and routes to larger cities.|$|E

The town council offered a {{compromise}} to allow Short to return for 10 days to get his affairs in order, but Earp refused to compromise. When Short returned, {{there was no one}} <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> him away. Short's Saloon reopened, and the Dodge City War ended without a shot being fired.|$|E

However, D'Angelo's mother convinces him to rescind the deal and take the charges for his family. The detail manages to arrest Avon on a minor charge and gets one of his soldiers, Wee-Bey, to confess {{to most of the}} murders, some of which he did not commit. Stringer escapes prosecution and is left running the Barksdale empire. For the officers, the consequences of antagonizing their superiors are severe, with Daniels passed over for promotion and McNulty assigned out of homicide and into the marine unit.|$|E

Kempenfelt had been purchased before the war began by the Canadian government, but it agreed to allow the British to retain her until the Royal Navy could compensate for her loss by requisitioning enough auxiliary anti-submarine vessels. By the time that the British were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> her over to the RCN, the ship was under repair after a collision and the hand over was delayed until 19 October. She was renamed Assiniboine and arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 17 November. The ship had not yet been fitting with the steam heating necessary to operate in a Canadian winter and she {{was transferred to}} the Caribbean in exchange for the destroyer [...] Assiniboine arrived at Kingston, Jamaica on 8 December.|$|E
