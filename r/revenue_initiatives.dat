40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{cost-saving}} potential of market-based instruments (MBIs) and other cost-savings mechanisms for small Ontario municipalities looking to operationalize their sustainable community plans. Market-based instruments are policy tools that encourage behavioral change through financial incentives or disincentives {{such as water}} pricing, anti-idling by-laws and user-pay garbage disposal (Clarke & MacDonald, 2012). Small Municipalities refer to all areas with municipal responsibilities, such as local administrations, with an urban core population of 10, 000 to 100, 000 inhabitants. Small municipalities are using sustainable community plans (SCPs) {{as a way to}} determine necessary areas of change. While 265 communities across Ontario are reaping the benefits of their sustainable community plans, small municipalities have been slow in operationalizing their plans due to limited financial capabilities. As a potential response to these limited financial capabilities, three research questions were developed: RQ 1 : Which market-based instruments or other cost-saving initiatives are related to sustainable community plan operationalization, and are generating cost-savings (and/or new revenue) in small municipalities? RQ 2 : What is the business case for operationalizing SCPs in small municipalities? RQ 3 : What are the sustainable community budgeting implications and local government policy implications of this study? Including, what new contributions does this study provide for literature? A multi-case study analysis using key informant interviews was used to research the use of market- based instruments and other cost-saving initiatives as a means of operationalizing small municipalities SCPs within five case communities: Halton Hills, Huron County, Frontenac County, King Township and Huntsville. The research was conducted in partnership with Lura Consulting; Lura is a sustainable consulting agency that specializes in formulating sustainable community plans. Face-to-face interviews with key sustainability personnel were conducted to record the usage of cost-saving or new <b>revenue</b> <b>initiatives.</b> The results of the study describe 22 of the 45 most common market-based instruments and other cost-saving initiatives that are being utilized within the case communities as a means of operationalizing SCPs. Of the total most commonly used cost-saving initiatives, 67 of the 105 initiatives have been directly or indirectly implemented within the case communities. These results further validate the inclusion of market-based instruments as a means of revenue generating or cost-savings...|$|E

40|$|There’s {{more good}} than bad in Labor’s latest Victorian budget, says David Hayward THE Bracks {{government}} delivered its fifth budget this week. The four-volume set of papers confirm that last year’s budget was a shocker. They {{also show that}} this year’s is Labor’s best. But there is still room for improvement. Why last year was so bad One way to judge the social policy impact of budgets is {{to see if they}} increase spending after we adjust for inflation. If they’re really good they lift it not just after inflation but also after adjusting for population growth or in real per capita terms. And if they’re really flying they lift spending as a share of the economy as well. Last year’s was a shocker because core social policy departments and programs were budgeted to receive real spending cuts, despite healthy sums being devoted to new initiatives, which were effectively paid for by cuts imposed elsewhere. Only health did unambiguously well. The community sector fought a long and bitter struggle over real spending cuts, and education fared particularly poorly, with head office forced to undergo a painful restructuring at the cost of hundreds of jobs. The most recent budget confirmed that these cuts were unnecessary, and that the government could have been far more generous that it was. One {{need look no further than}} the budget surplus to find evidence to support this. Instead of delivering the shaky $ 245 m operating surplus that was budgeted for last May, the estimates furnished in the most recent budget papers show that Labor will end up delivering one almost double that size ($ 433 m). Stripped of a one-off $ 1. 3 b expense associated with the restructuring of electricity subsidies, the operating surplus will end up at almost $ 1. 7 b, with a one-off $ 1. 3 b expense helping to hide the true state of the bottom line. (See figure 1 in the attached Word version of this article - link below.) Despite all the talk of doom and gloom, the Department of Education and Training will still deliver a $ 132 m operating surplus, leaving analysts scratching their heads as to why the restructuring was forced through in the first place. Why this budget is better If last year’s budget was a shocker, why is this one so good? Unlike earlier budgets, this one promises to deliver real spending increases. And if previous years are any guide we can expect a swag of new measures around December - but only if the government is confident that the revenues necessary to fund them are pouring in. Table 1 shows which departments have done well. Victorian Communities heads the list on a percentage change basis, but on a dollar basis it’s Human Services - and particularly health - which again have done very well, as has Infrastructure, and Justice. The real increase for Education is also significant. Labor can expect criticism from the financial press for spending increases of this magnitude. After adjusting for funding provided from existing sources and savings required elsewhere, the new initiatives this year come to a hefty $ 640 m (see table 2), and departmental budgets all look very healthy. The main exception is Sustainability and Environment, but its cut is mainly because of one-off expenses associated with last year’s bush fires, which are not expected to be needed again this year. One very big reason why the budget isn’t perfect Most of the initiatives are small and very well chosen. Especially pleasing is the significant boost that’s been given to public dental health, which is to get a $ 25 m or 32 per cent increase. The one exception to this is the introduction of a First Home Owners Bonus, valued at $ 5000 for each recipient, which will cost the budget $ 125 m next financial year. It really has very little to recommend it. It is not targeted. It can be used by any first home buyer regardless of income to purchase a dwelling up to $ 500, 000 (apartments included). It can be used to buy an existing house or a new one, so it will have only a small impact on building employment. It is a cash payment that can be used for the purchase of any item chosen by the recipient, so it might not be used for housing purposes at all. It is unlikely to meet the objective of making first homes more affordable; it might simply lead to higher house prices than would otherwise be the case, as has clearly happened with the federal government’s First Home Buyers Scheme. It would have been much more sensible to redirect this money into a large scale social housing acquisition program. There will be 26, 000 lucky middle to high income households in Victoria over the next year, who can thank there lucky stars for such an ill-conceived policy initiative. Capital spending: big and getting bigger Particularly pleasing is the massive increase in infrastructure spending, which is tipped to rise from $ 2. 1 b to a massive $ 2. 47 b, compared to barely $ 1 b when Labor took office. This is one of Labor’s great achievements, for which they can quite rightly take a bow. Revenues: a mixed bag On the revenue side of the equation the story is mixed. As table 3 shows, overall revenue growth is tipped at a healthy 4. 5 per cent, but most of the projected revenue growth comes from three sources: federal grants, investment income and fines. The former is primarily a result of GST revenues as well as specific funding for non-government schools, while the latter reflects the effect of traffic cameras becoming fully operational after their technical troubles of the last year. These revenue sources are primarily regressive in their effect. What accounts for the small increase in state taxation? Part of the answer is cuts to land taxes and mortgage duty, which after adjusting for new <b>revenue</b> <b>initiatives</b> will cost the budget $ 137 m. Whether state tax growth is only $ 144 m (a considerable fall in real terms) as tipped in the budget is open to question. Much depends on what happens with the property market. In previous years Treasury has forecast a property slump, which hasn’t come to fruition. Next year Treasury is again forecasting a slump, but this time I suspect they will be right. One of the more interesting revelations in the budget papers is that the land tax cuts announced as part of the Economic Statement are not as significant as they first seemed. These cuts were greeted with disappointment by the social sector and for good reason. As the Harvey Review of Business Taxation pointed out, land taxes are a highly efficient wealth tax, which should account for more, not less of state taxation. The Economic Statement somewhat mischievously said that the tax cuts would save business an estimated $ 128 m in 2004 - 05, and more than $ 200 m thereafter. The budget papers show that while this is true, the overall land tax take is projected to increase by $ 150 m or almost 20 per cent as a consequence of the revaluation of the land tax base as well as the introduction of a new land tax on electricity transmission companies. Undoubtedly the most disappointing aspect of the revenue side of the budget is that the government is intending to see the state become a below average tax jurisdiction. Our tax take is projected to be 0. 9 per cent of Gross State Product less than New South Wales, and 0. 2 per cent less than the average for all the states. Translated into dollars, this amounts to approximately $ 2 b less than is available to the government of New South Wales to fund service delivery - that’s a lot of money in any language. The surplus fetish One of the most disappointing aspects of the budget is Labor’s continuing fetish with budget surpluses. This time the government is budgeting for an operating surplus of $ 545 m, even though its policy commitment is for a surplus of only $ 100 m. There are several hundred million dollars here that could easily have been dedicated to service level improvements without in the least compromising the integrity of the budget. Victoria continues to run the harshest budget settings in the country for reasons that are not entirely clear. Conclusion This is Labor’s best budget, although there is clearly room for improvement. Social spending is up in real terms, however we measure it, and that’s a very good sign. It’s a pity that so much money has been wasted on the First Home Owners Bonus. It’s also a pity that the government continues to drive the state toward a low tax status, especially when there are so many unmet social needs. And then there’s that surplus fetish. Nevertheless there are welcome signs that the Bracks Labor giant has awakened from its slumber and has at long last started to move purposefully in the right direction.
