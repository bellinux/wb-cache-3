50|$|With {{the rise}} of the professionalized {{practice}} of western architecture {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, the field of architectural reprography—and the corresponding developments of photography and mass-produced wood-pulp paper—saw significant experiments and advances in technology. Beginning with major refinements in blueprinting processes in the 1840s, through the widespread adoption of diazotype printing after World War II, the design profession turned to analog architectural <b>reprography</b> to create accurate, to-scale reproductions of original drawings created on tracing paper, vellum, and linen supports. These copies were typically used throughout the architect’s own design process and also for distribution to clients, contractors, governmental agencies, and other interested parties. However, the integration of CAD—or Computer-Aided Design—over the last twenty-five years of design practice has made analog <b>reprography</b> far less common in the profession and more ephemeral in nature. For archivists, curators, librarians and other custodians of architectural records, traditional reprographic formats are now often seen as historic documents, with attendant needs for long-term care and conservation.|$|E

50|$|In China, an {{alternative}} to woodblock printing was a system of <b>reprography</b> since the Han Dynasty using carved stone steles to reproduce pages of text. The three necessary components for woodblock printing are the wood block, which carries the design cut in relief; dye or ink, which had been widely used in the ancient world; and either cloth or paper, which was first developed in China, around the 3rd century BC or 2nd century BC. Woodblock printing on papyrus seems never to have been practised, although it would be possible.|$|E

50|$|For large {{collections}} of architectural materials, conservation work can address several areas of concern. Consultation {{with a professional}} conservator is recommended, although some minor treatments {{can be accomplished by}} general caretakers with training. Rolled and folded <b>reprography,</b> once cleaned, can be flattened through humidification. Cleaning may be done with white vinyl erasers, using great care in areas of friable media, such as graphite and colored pencil. Tears, losses, and other surface damage should be treated by a professional conservator. For particularly fragile or frequently-handled prints, sheets may be encapsulated in polyester or polypropylene film for additional support and protection. This is not recommended, however, for reprographic prints with annotations in friable media.|$|E
50|$|Reprographics or <b>reprography</b> {{covers a}} variety of technologies, media, and support {{services}} used to make multiple copies of original drawings. Prints of architectural drawings are still sometimes called blueprints, {{after one of the}} early processes which produced a white line on blue paper. The process was superseded by the dye-line print system which prints black on white coated paper (Whiteprint). The standard modern processes are the ink-jet printer, laser printer and photocopier, of which the ink-jet and laser printers are commonly used for large-format printing. Although colour printing is now commonplace, it remains expensive above A3 size, and architect's working drawings still tend to adhere to the black and white / greyscale aesthetic.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] heliographic copier or [...] heliographic {{duplicator}} is {{an apparatus}} {{used in the}} world of <b>reprography</b> for making contact prints on paper from original drawings made with that purpose on tracing paper, parchment paper or any other transparent or translucent material using different procedures. In general terms some type of heliographic copier is used for making: Hectographic prints, Ferrogallic prints, Gel-lithographs or Silver halide prints. All of them, until a certain size, can be achieved using a contact printer with an appropriate lamp (ultraviolet, etc...) but for big engineering and architectural plans, the heliographic copiers used with the cyanotype and the diazotype technologies, are of the roller type, which makes them completely different from contact printers.|$|E

50|$|In July 1968 Queensland State Archives was {{relocated}} to a purpose-built facility in Dutton Park. Conservation was accorded a new {{emphasis in the}} Dutton Park building, with fumigation chambers installed to deal with pest and mould infestation. Stricter environmental controls were placed upon the storage of the records. There {{was an increase in}} the number and complexity of reference enquiries and new <b>reprography</b> services were introduced. A microfilm camera was purchased in 1971 and a microfilm storage vault was built. The use of microfilm provided access to heavily used records while preserving the original documents. Space was again an issue by 1974 and in 1978 a building at West End in Brisbane was acquired for use as remote storage. A new building was proposed and a site selected at Runcorn.|$|E
