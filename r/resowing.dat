5000|$|Various {{modifications}} of cultural practices {{have been tried}} for the control of cedar leaf blight. In Britain, western red cedar seedlings were grown in nurseries isolated from known sources of inoculum, but the results were inconclusive. Another suggestion was to grow Thuja in isolated nurseries. [...] Thuja would be raised from seed at isolated nurseries with a periodic clearance of all cedar stock before <b>resowing.</b> This was partly successful, but some outbreaks of cedar leaf blight still occurred. Growing bareroot nursery or transplant cedar at reduced densities (seedlings per unit area), e.g., to decrease within canopy humidity, has provided some measure of blight control. Growing cedar as a mixture with other species, both in seed and transplant beds, has also given some control of the disease.|$|E
40|$|An Experiment {{to examine}} the {{nitrogen}} fluxes after ploughing up and <b>resowing</b> grassland {{was conducted on the}} organic experimental station “Lindhof” in northern Germany.

40|$|The article {{highlights}} {{the results of}} studying the soft winter wheat response to the duration of enforced winter dormancy {{and the time of}} vegetation recommencing, their impact on growth, development and the survival of the crops. It is found that the impact of those factors in the conditions of central Forest-Steppe of Ukraine is essential, which is to be taken into consideration when scheduling the measures of spring and summer care over the cultivated crops, in particular, where the spring extra nutrition takes place, pesticides and growth regulators are applied, the spaced planting <b>resowing</b> or partial <b>resowing</b> issues are to be settled down. The ecological effect of spring vegetation recommencing dates does not expose annually, therefore it is not always possible to predict the plant development type, but it is possible, nevertheless, to influence the processes of growth, development and survival of plants throughout spring-summer period and the development of their production capacity by means of introducing the intense technologies, optimization of mineral nutrition and the use of plant growth regulators, protection from rogues, diseases, pests...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} whether converting to organic farming increases weed problems, a trial at Massey University in New Zealand split a dairy farm in half, with one half farmed conventionally for 10 {{years and the}} other half farmed using organic principles. Weed populations in selected paddocks of each farmlet were studied for 8 years to determine how these populations would differ between the two systems. After 10 years, weed problems differed little between the two farmlets. Both still had broad-leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolius L.) and hairy buttercup (Ranunculus sardous Crantz) as their main weed species. Weeds were most noticeable in pastures in the year following regrassing activities for either farmlet, but being unable to use glyphosate during seed-bed preparation or use selective herbicides after sowing of new swards, meant weeds were sometimes worse in organic pastures after <b>resowing</b> than in conventional pastures. These weed problems were dealt with over the first few years after <b>resowing</b> by good grazing management, and ensuring pastures were dense once the annual species hairy buttercup had flowered and died, thus minimising any further establishment. Re- sults from the trial suggest that weeds need not be an impediment to organic dairying. falseThe full proceedings is available at: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{ecology and}} control of cereal cyst {{nematode}} in southern Australia is reviewed. The wide distribution of Heterodera avenae in Victoria and South Australia is due largely to movement of cysts by wind during dust storms. The fungus Rhizoctonia solani frequently {{is associated with the}} nematode in a disease complex in wheat, and disease symptoms are most severe on lighter or well structured soils. Crop rotations which include periods of fallow, or of nonhost crop reduce population levels of H. avenae and improve yields. Early-sown crops (April-May) are less severely damaged than late-sown crops (June-July). The <b>resowing</b> of damaged wheat crops or the application of nitrogenous fertilizers rarely improve grain yields. 'Katyil,' the world's first wheat cultivar bred specifically with resistance to H. avenae, has been released in Victoria.

40|$|In intensively {{cultivated}} {{areas with}} light soils in Europe, wind erosion can have important on-site and off-site effects. In {{the framework of}} the EU research project Wind Erosion and European Light Soils (WEELS), an assessment has been made of these effects and of the order of magnitude of the damage and costs caused by these effects. An analysis is made of the land use and cropping in four selected sites, and farmers have provided information about the damage of wind erosion. This damage consists mainly of crop losses and additional inputs in the case of <b>resowing.</b> Detailed information from one of these sites shows that depending on the crop the average annual on-site costs in high-risk areas amount to about 60 per hectare. However, for sugar beet and oilseed rape the costs can be once in five years as much as 500 per hectare. Farmers are generally well aware of the erosion risk and do apply a variety of control measures. With these measures the average annual costs of wind erosion can be reduced significantly...|$|E

40|$|The {{proposal}} that "agricultural biotechnology {{is vital for}} the future of the developing world" can immediately be contradicted if we are talking about GM crops. Evidence is building up that they are unsafe, unsound and unsustainable. If they’re not good for us here they can’t be good for the developing world. GM crops allow corporations to tighten their monopoly on agriculture though patented seeds that farmers can’t <b>resow.</b> And that is especially important for the developing world. Last month, it transpired that GM canola fields in Canada had contaminated non-GM seeds sold to Europe, after tens of thousands of hectares have been planted. GM pollution is not restricted to cross-pollination between the same or related species. Prof. Kaatz of Jena has just discovered that GM genes may have jumped from GM pollen to bacteria and yeasts in the gut of baby bees [1]. The finding is not unexpected, as scientists including myself have been warning of this possibility for years. The risks of gene jumping are inherent to the GM technology. GM genetic material is not like ordinary genetic material. Natural genetic material innon-GM food is broken down by special enzymes to provide energy and building-blocks for growth and repair. And should the foreign genetic material get into a cell’s own geneti...|$|R
40|$|In {{perennial}} grasslands R. obtusifolius (broad-leaved dock) {{is often}} surrounded by certain plant species. Thus, it is hypothesized {{for the current}} study that Rumex can affect their neighbouring plant species by allelopathic interactions. To test this hypothesis, {{in a series of}} laboratory and field experiments aqueous extracts of green R. obtusifolius leaves were sprayed on seeds of 14 herbaceous plant species (graminoids, non-leguminuous forbs and leguminuous forbs) commonly native to perennial grasslands and its effects on seed germination compared with those with tap water spraying. An allelopathic effect was defined as inhibitory influence of Rumex extracts on seed germination relative to tap water. Generally, results of the laboratory experiments showed a species-specific susceptibility of grassland species to Rumex extracts; no species was promoted by Rumex extracts. All grasses tested were heavily inhibited by Rumex extracts, herbs and legumes varied from not affected until heavily inhibited. Spraying of Rumex extracts in the field had no effect on germination of these species. The results could be considered in designing seeding mixtures for <b>resowing</b> sward damages to especially contain species not susceptible to Rumex allelopathy (e. g. Trifolium pratense, T. repens, Plantago lanceolata) that would thus be assumed to be more competitive against R. obtusifolius regrowing in these grasslands...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} Pseudomonas fluorescens F 113 {{to produce the}} {{antibiotic}} 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) is {{a key factor in}} the biocontrol of the phytopathogenic fungus Pythium ultimum by this strain. In this study, a DAPG-producing strain (rifampin-resistant mutant F 113 Rif) was compared with a nearly isogenic DAPG-negative biosynthesis mutant (Tn 5 ::lacZY derivative F 113 G 22) in terms of the ability to colonize and persist in the rhizosphere of sugarbeets in soil microcosms during 10 plant growth-harvest cycles totaling 270 days. Both strains persisted similarly in the rhizosphere for 27 days, regardless of whether they had been inoculated singly onto seeds or coinoculated in a 1 : 1 ratio. In order to simulate harvest and <b>resowing,</b> the roots were removed from the soil and the pots were resown with uninoculated sugarbeet seeds for nine successive 27 -day growth-harvest cycles. Strains F 113 Rif and F 113 G 22 performed similarly with respect to colonizing the rhizosphere of sugarbeet, even after nine cycles without reinoculation. The introduced strains had a transient effect {{on the size of the}} total culturable aerobic bacterial population. The results indicate that under these experimental conditions, the inability to produce DAPG did not reduce the ecological fitness of strain F 113 in the rhizosphere of sugarbeets...|$|E

Proceedings of the 23 rd Eucarpia Fodder Crops and Amenity Grasses Section Meeting, Angra do Heroismo, Azores, Portugal, 1 - 4 October 2000. A new consortium (called SAGES) of European geneticists, plant physiologists, plant breeders, and seed merchants has been formed with EU funding.

SAGES uses conventional breeding and the natural biodiversity of Europe's grasslands to develop high quality forage grasses adapted to diverse abiotic stresses encountered throughout Europe. SAGES uses new technology and unique opportunities provided within Lolium and Festuca species to "dissect" the complex traits associated with stress resistance. It will help develop understanding of the physiological mechanisms involved, and will provide genetic markers to select gene combinations governing desirable traits for future use in cultivar production. The new cultivars will contain functioning stable gene combinations designed to improve productivity and persistency and reduce costs of fertilizer, irrigation, and <b>resowing.</b> Increased productivity will benefit incomes and help maintain fragile rural communities and keep people on the land...|$|E
40|$|Direct seeding mulch-based {{cropping}} systems under a preliminary cover crop such as millet {{are common in}} some areas of Brazil. Lepidopteran pests that damage cotton, soybean and maize crops can proliferate on cover crops, so preventive chemical treatments are necessary. Very Little data is available on these pests on coyer crops. This paper presents the dynamics of Spodoptera frugiperda,. S. eridania, Macis latipes and Diatraea saccharalis caterpillars monitored at Primavera do Leste, Mato Grosso state (Brazil) during the of 2005 / 2006 and 2 oo 6 / 2007 cropping seasons on four cover crops, i. e. finger millet (Eleusine (oracana), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), sorghum (Sarghum bicalor) and ruzigrass (Brachiaria ruziziensis). The pests were visually counted on plants within a 1 m 2 transect (wooden frame). Caterpillars were reared to facilitateidentification of collected species and parasitoids. Many S. frugiperda caterpillars were observed on millet in 2005, with a maximum of 37 caterpillars/ m 2 o Onsorghum, we found 30 caterpillars/m 2, or 0. 83 caterpillars/plant. The Diatraea borer attacked sorghùm later than the other pests. M. latipes was also observed on millet. The millet cover crop had to be dried for at least 1 month before direct drilling the main cotton crop in order to impede S. {rugiperda infestations on cotton plantlets, thus avoiding the need for substantial <b>resowing.</b> The comparative methodological aspects are discussed.

40|$|We report here on an 8 -year study {{examining}} {{links between}} plant and nematode communities in a grassland plant diversity experiment, {{located in the}} north of Sweden on previous agricultural soil. The examined plots contained 1, 4 and 12 common grassland plant species from three functional groups; grasses, legumes and forbs. The same plant species composition was maintained in the plots through weeding and <b>resowing</b> during the experimental period. The hypotheses were (i) that the nematode community would shift towards a more diverse and mature fauna over time and (ii) that the effects of both plant species identity and plant species richness would increase over time. As hypothesized, the Bongers' Maturity Index (a measure of nematode responses to disturbance) increased over time, but not nematode diversity. Instead, the nematode community development in the present grassland experiment seemed to be more characterized by shifts in dominance patterns than by colonization of new taxa. Clear temporal trends were found for plant-feeders and Adenophorea bacterial-feeders which increased in abundance over time in almost all plant treatments. Rhabditidae bacterial-feeders decreased in abundance over time, in particular in plots with legumes. Fungal-feeders, omnivores/predators and the two nematode indices PPI (Bongers' Plant Parasitic Index) and NCR (Nematode Channel Ratio) had significant interactions between plant composition and time giving some support to our second hypothesis. Our results highlight the need for long-term experiments to examine plant species effects on soil fauna, especially on taxa belonging to higher trophic levels. The results also stress the importance of plant composition for belowground soil faunal communities. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out in Italy on the {{potential}} use of the hyperaccumulator Alyssum bertolonii in phytomining of ultramafic soils for Ni. In situ experimental plots at Murlo, Tuscany were fertilized with various regimes during a 2 -year period. The best fertilizer treatment (N 4 - K 4 - P) gave a threefold increase of the biomass of reproductive matter to 9. 0 t/ha without dilution of the unfertilized Ni content. A Ni content of 0. 8 % in dry matter (11 % in ash), would give a Ni yield of 72 kg/ha without need of <b>resowing</b> for a further crop. There was no correlation between the age of a plant and its Ni content. The long-term cropping sustainability of the soils was simulated by sequential extractions with KH phthalate solutions at pH 2, 4 and 6 that showed a limiting available Ni content of 768 μg/g. Thus just over seven croppings at pH 6 in the rhizosphere would reduce the available Ni pool by 30 %. A proposed model for phytomining involves harvesting the crop after 12 months and burning the material to produce a sulphur-free bio-ore with about 11 % Ni. Utilising the energy of combustion is also discussed. It is considered that Alyssum bertolonii or other Alyssum species might be used for phytomining throughout the Mediterranean area including Anatolia, {{as well as in}} Western Australia and the western United States. The economic limits of phytomining are proposed and at current world prices, the technique would only be feasible for Ni and Co with plants of at least the same biomass as Alyssum. Plants of higher biomass and similar uptake potential as for Ni, could extend the limits to other elements...|$|E
40|$|In {{vineyards}} in Spain, tillage and semiarid Mediterranean {{climatic conditions}} accelerate organic matter loss from the soil. Cover crops are a conservation management practice that can provoke changes in soil quality which requires evaluation. Stratification ratios of soil properties such as soil organic C and labile C fractions {{have been proposed}} {{for the assessment of}} soil quality under different soil management systems. Our objective was to study the effect of different cover crop management on various soil parameters and their stratification ratios. We evaluated three different soil managements in a Typic Haploxerept from NE Spain: conventional tillage (CT); 5 -y continuous cover crop of resident vegetation (RV); and 4 -y continuous cover crop of Festuca longifolia Thuill., followed by 1 -y Bromus catharticus L. after <b>resowing</b> (BV). We monitored soil organic C, particulate organic C, water soluble C, potentially mineralizable N, microbial biomass C, β-glucosidase and urease enzymatic activities, and water stable aggregates at 0 - 2. 5, 2. 5 - 5, 5 - 15, 15 - 25, and 25 - 45 cm soil depths. We calculated soil depth stratification ratios of those soil properties. Resident cover crop increased microbiological properties, labile C fractions, and aggregation with respect to conventional tillage at 0 - 2. 5 and 2. 5 - 5 cm soil depths. However, for Bromus cover crop the same soil properties were lower than for the resident cover crop at 0 - 2. 5 cm depth. Stratification ratios of β-glucosidase and urease enzymatic activities, and particulate organic C showed a higher sensitivity than other soil properties; therefore, they would be the best indicators for soil quality assessment in semiarid Mediterranean vineyards. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
