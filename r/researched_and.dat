In this case, <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development has become a major need that can give alternative in solution of local development. The role of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development is demandding quality {{that can be used in}} the procces of preparing the planning of local development programs. In the context of increasing the quality of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development that is done by Bappeda, there are a very complex handicap must be faced. Some problem that must be overcome quickly is a relatively lower quality of the personnal on <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development, the policy of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development do not refer to five agenda of development at Central Java Provice, lack of authorithy and competence in implementing the function of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development and also limitation in facility of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development net sistem that is still by sector. Problems of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development that is faced by Bappeda need a structuraly and functionaly handling steps through the strategy planning on increasing quality of the <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development. Aims and advantages of this strategy, are emphazised on increasing and developing internal factor of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development by using external factors thatcan encourage the improvement on <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development quality. It is hoped that the planning of strategy will be one of foundation of policy in increasing <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development quality at Bappeda in the future. In order to analyse strategi planning on increasing reasearch and development quality, it is used SWOT qualitative analisys method. By using Matrix Internal-External mode. From the analisys, can be known the position of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development of Bappeda at this time is on growth strategy level With the horizontal integration growth strategy alternative. The suitable strategy to implied in this position is by strengthen <b>and</b> developed <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development institution, development of human resources on <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development, reorientation of the <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development policy, <b>and</b> development of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> development net facility.

The book depicts special interests and contrarians misleading the public as being mainly responsible for stopping action on policy. He says this shows a lack of basic understanding of the political process and the mechanisms of knowledge policy, because the authors assume that public policy would follow on from an understanding of the science. While the book provides all the (formal) hallmarks of science, Grundmann sees it less as a scholarly work than a passionate attack and overall as a problematic book.|$|E

There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights.|$|E
