40|$|The {{fineness}} {{of cotton}} {{is important because}} yarn made from fine fibers is generally stronger and more uniform than yarn from coarse fibers. Fiber maturity is important because mature fibers, those with welldeveloped cell walls, absorb dye better and are less prone to cause defects of various sorts in the finished product. Micronaire measurements {{are considered to be}} a combination of fiber fineness and maturity (Thibodeaux et al., 2000). Improved reference methods to measure fineness and maturity are needed to calibrate the faster, high-volume instruments that grade cotton for these properties. A substantially improved highvolume instrument is also needed because millions of samples must be analyzed each year, but the accuracy of the data must not be compromised in order to attain speed.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{our study}} {{was to assess the}} {{applicability}} of Parkinson's patients to use a dry powder inhaler correctly during their off periods, when motor function impairments like tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity are present. Background: Because of its expected rapid onset of effect, pulmonary administration of levodopa is an interesting alternative to orally administered levodopa for the rescue treatment of Parkinson's disease patients in an off period. The inspiratory flow manoeuvre performed by a patient is crucial for the performance and the suitability of a dry powder inhaler and is therefore assessed. Methods: After obtaining written informed consent, 15 patients were asked to postpone there scheduled levodopa dose in order to become off. Before the inhalation procedure started, the extent of the off state was scored by a neurologist, by using the (old) UPDRS motor section 3. Patients were asked to simulate an inhalation manoeuvre through a test inhaler (without drug), with three different <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow,</b> in order <b>to</b> obtain information about their ability to inhale correctly through an inhaler during off periods. The study was approved by the ethics commitee. Results: Two patients did not become off and were therefore not included for analysis. Measurements with the other 13 Parkinson's patients during off periods showed that patients were able to perform an inhalation manoeuvre correctly, hold their breath for an acceptable time to facilitate deep lung deposition and create the pressure drop necessary to achieve a proper dispersion of a dry powder formulation, like levodopa. Conclusions: The inhalation data gathered in this study set the limits within which levodopa dry powder inhalation products for the rescue treatment of Parkinson's disease patients in an off period should effectively disperse and emit the required dose. They are, therefore, essential in any development activities towards such a product. The demonstrated ability of Parkinson's disease patients in an off period to perform an inhalation manoeuvre is expected to be sufficient for the successful development of levodopa dry powder inhalation products for the rescue treatment during an off period of this particular patient group...|$|R

An important {{problem in the}} refrigeration industry is the formation and removal of frost layers on sub-freezing air coolers. The frost layer, a porous structure of ice and air, directly diminishes the performance and efficiency of the entire cooling system by presenting <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> and heat transfer in the <b>air</b> cooler. <b>To</b> return the system to pre-frosted performance the layer must be removed through a defrost cycle. The most common defrost cycle uses heat applied at the heat exchanger surfaces to melt the frost. Current methods of defrosting are inherently inefficient, {{with the majority of}} the heat being lost to the surrounding environment. Most studies have concentrated on the formation of the frost layer, and not the melting phenomena during the defrost cycle. In this study, direct measurements and a fundamental model to describe the melting process of a frost layer on a vertical heated surface are presented. The experimental facility provides the first direct measurements of heat and mass transfer during defrost. The measurements confirmed the multistage nature of defrost. The multistage model characterized the different thermal and mass transport processes that dominate each stage. The first stage is dominated by sensible heating of the frost layer. Both the experiment and model showed that heat and mass transfer through sublimation during the initial stages are insignificant, accounting for less than 1 % of the total energy transfer. The second stage of defrost is dominated by the melting of the frost layer. The melt rate model generally predicts the front velocity within 25 % of the velocity determined using the digital image analysis technique. Higher heat transfer rates resulted in faster melt velocity, and thus shortened defrost times. Evaporation of the melt liquid from the surface dominates the final stage. The heat transfer model for this stage predicts the heat transfer coefficient within ± 25 % of the experiment. The overall defrost efficiency was found to be primarily dependent on the initial frost thickness, with thicker layer having less heat lost to the ambient space and a higher efficiency...|$|R

The main parameter to assess the properties of highly porous fibrous material is its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the <b>air</b> <b>flow,</b> which can be estimated by the value of the hydraulic resistance. This parameter includes both the characteristics of the mineral fiber (diameter, length, density) characteristics of the system as a whole (total porosity, average density, the content of fibrous inclusions) and gas environment parameters (temperature and speed of its motion through the porous layer). Characteristics of the gaseous medium are technological factors, which influence the material during the heat treatment, and hence optimization of the process parameters. The flow of gas through the perforated wall of the hole determined by characteristics, pressurized inside a rolling pin, and the structural characteristics of the mineral geometrical cylinder and his hydraulic resistance. So, a universal criterion, which measures the mass transfer efficiency and hence the effectiveness of the heat treatment, is a hydraulic resistance cylinder. The study of the processes occurring in the mineral wool carpet, showed that its hydraulic resistance is directly proportional to the surface of fibers per unit bed volume and inversely proportional to the third degree of porosity of the layer. Researches have shown that increasing the degree of perforation increases the uneven distribution. However, if total power increases 1. 87 times, because the perforation through the inlet portion perforation of rolling pin was disclosure, substantially uniform distribution was achieved. The investigations led to the following conclusions: the specific surface layer has a linear dependence on its average density; hydraulic resistance of the layer will be greater, when the amount of beads and fibers diameter is smaller. The obtained exact dependence allows calculating the hydraulic <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the flow of gas in the cylinder mineral wool.

40|$|Visual Impairment /Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) {{is a top}} human spaceflight {{risk for}} which NASA does not {{currently}} have a proven mitigation strategy. Thigh cuffs (Braslets) and lower body negative pressure (LBNP; Chibis) devices have been or are currently being evaluated {{as a means to}} reduce VIIP signs and symptoms, but these methods alone may not provide sufficient relief of cephalic venous congestion and VIIP symptoms. Additionally, current LBNP devices are too large and cumbersome for their systematic use as a countermeasure. Therefore, a novel approach is needed that is easy to implement and provides specific relief of symptoms. This investigation will evaluate an impedance threshold device (ITD) as a VIIP countermeasure. The ITD works by providing up to 7 cm H 2 O (approximately 5 mmHg) <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> inspiratory <b>air</b> <b>flow,</b> effectively turning the thorax into a vacuum pump upon each inhalation which lowers the intrathoracic pressure (ITP) and facilitates venous return to the heart. The ITD is FDA-approved and was developed to augment venous return to the central circulation and increase cardiac output during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and in patients with hypotension. While the effect of ITD on CPR survival outcomes is controversial, the ITD's ability to lower ITP with a concomitant decrease in intracranial pressure (ICP) is well documented. A similar concept that creates negative ITP during exhalation (intrathoracic pressure regulator; ITPR) decreased ICP in 16 of 20 patients with elevated ICP in a hospital pilot study. ITP and central venous pressure (CVP) have been shown to decrease in microgravity however ITP drops more than CVP, indicating an increased transmural CVP. This could explain the paradoxical distention of jugular veins (JV) in microgravity despite lower absolute CVP and also suggests that JV transmural pressure is not dramatically elevated. Use of an ITD may lower JV pressure enough to remove or relieve cephalic venous congestion. During spaceflight experiments with Braslet thigh cuffs and modified (open-glottis) Mueller maneuvers, Braslets alone reduced cardiac preload but only reduced the internal JV (IJV) cross sectional area by 23 %. The addition of Mueller maneuvers resulted in an IJV area reduction of 48 %. This project will test if ITD essentially applies a Mueller maneuver with added negative ITP in every respiratory cycle, acting to: 1) reduce venous congestion in the neck and 2) potentially lower ICP. The expected mechanism of action is that in microgravity (or an analog) blood is relocated toward the heart from vasculature in the head and neck. Once validated, the ITD would be an exceptionally easy countermeasure to deploy and test on the ISS. Dosage could be altered though 1) duration of application and 2) inspiratory resistance set point. Effects could be additionally enhanced through co-application with other countermeasures such as thigh cuffs or LBNP...|$|R
