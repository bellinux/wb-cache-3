5|$|Kirchherr {{admits that}} she is not good at {{business}} as she is not organised enough, and has never <b>really</b> <b>looked</b> after the negatives of her photographs to prove ownership. Her business partner Ulf Krüger—a songwriter and record producer—successfully found many of Astrid's negatives and photographs and had them copyrighted, although he believes that Kirchherr has lost £500,000 over the years because of people using her photographs without permission. In July 2001 Kirchherr visited Liverpool to open an exhibition of her work at the Mathew Street art gallery, which is close to the former site of The Cavern Club. She appeared as a guest at the city's Beatles Week Festival during the August Bank Holiday. Kirchherr's work has been exhibited internationally in places, such as Hamburg, Bremen, London, Liverpool, New York City, Washington D.C., Tokyo, Vienna, and at the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.|$|E
25|$|The second match saw Agnieszka Radwańska {{trying to}} advance to the semifinals taking on Petra Kvitová. With Kvitová, Victoria Azarenka and Samantha Stosur already through, Radwańska had to take a set from Kvitová on Friday to become the fourth player into the final four. And that goal didn't seem far away at all as she stormed out to a 5–1 first set lead - but Kvitová {{suddenly}} came alive, her power game hitting its mark as she stormed back to take the opening set comfortably in a tie-break. Although there were a few close moments midway through the second set - she went to six deuces before holding in a marathon game for 4–3 - Kvitová never <b>really</b> <b>looked</b> in trouble again, eventually finishing the match off with a big crosscourt forehand that drew one last backhand error from Radwańska. Whether she was winning or losing, Kvitová seemed to be in complete control of the score against Radwańska - she finished the match with 42 winners to 47 unforced errors, while Radwańska had eight winners to 17 unforced errors. Kvitová finished first in the Red Group with a bullet, 3–0 in win-loss and 6–0 in sets. Although Zvonareva, Radwańska and Caroline Wozniacki all ended with a 1–2 win–loss record and 3–5 sets won-lost, Zvonareva had the best games won-lost percentage of the three and thus finished second in the Red Group. The semifinals will be Red Group No.1 Kvitová taking on White Group No.2 Stosur, and White Group No.1 Azarenka taking on Red Group No.2 Zvonareva.|$|E
500|$|James Berardinelli {{gave the}} film 2 stars out of 4, calling it [...] "the most lifeless of the series" [...] and [...] "simply [...] {{a very good}} motion picture." [...] Margaret Pomeranz of At the Movies gave the film 2 1/2 stars out of 5, saying that the filmmakers [...] "had 19 years since the last Indiana Jones movie {{to come up with}} {{something}} truly exciting and fresh, but I feel there's a certain laziness and cynicism in this latest adventure." [...] Associated Press reported that J. Sperling Reich, who writes for FilmStew.com, said: [...] "It <b>really</b> <b>looked</b> like they were going through the motions. It <b>really</b> <b>looked</b> like no one had their heart in it."

He added, [...] "there were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there – a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other. It was pretty sensational." ...|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began on}} Monday, December 11, 1989, and lasted for seven days. The episode was {{directed}} by David Carson, who had only filmed one other Next Generation episode before [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise". Carson felt that his relative lack of experience helped {{because he had no}} preconceptions about how episodes should be directed. Since much of the episode took place in the darker alternate universe, Carson wanted to emphasize the toll that decades of war had taken on the crew and the bridge. [...] "Picard <b>really</b> <b>looked</b> tired and worn and like a battle-weary commander, and that's what we wanted the bridge to look like—a battle weary bridge. I had lots of thoughts about making it as strong as possible using a lot of low lights, a lot of dark blues, making it very much more moody", he said. To heighten the impact of the physical set changes, Carson took a different approach to how he constructed shots. [...] "It was my intention to make it as much like a submarine as possible and to use low-angle lighting; basically, to do everything the opposite way that the Enterprise was normally shot." [...] The cameras were equipped with longer lenses than usual {{in order to reduce the}} depth of the scenes and provide a grittier feel. The use of low angles forced the lighting to be modified to prevent the scene from, in Carson's words, looking [...] "like a hotel lobby".|$|E
500|$|Pamela and Bobby's {{relationship}} {{changed significantly}} {{as the show}} went on and began to progress. In order to create conflict, the producers brought in actors Priscilla Presley (Jenna Wade) and John Beck (Mark Graison) to cause drama for the couple. Eventually, the two characters divorced one another and went their separate ways. After becoming involved with Ewing oil, Bobby tended to put Pam on the backburner with the company coming first. In an interview with People, Principal said: [...] "I wouldn't {{put up with the}} way Pam is treated by Bobby." [...] She also added, [...] "Our marriage just doesn't work anymore and I want a divorce." [...] With the impending couple doomed, Pamela began a newfound relationship with Mark Graison (played by John Beck). The producers of Dallas were faced with the obstacle of getting the audience to root for a new love interest in Pam's life. When asked about the reception of his characters relationship with Pamela, Beck commented: [...] "It was always set up that way from the beginning, so it was quite a task and of course they came back together in the long run. I was just hoping for the best. I never got an extraordinary reaction from the public but it was everywhere, so constant recognition. It was pretty amazing but I never saw it the way he sees it but I can see his point of view. I never <b>really</b> <b>looked</b> at it like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990s, Milica, Aleksia and Milos had a {{division}} called Guess Home, which featured youthful, upscale bedding collections (Guess {{was the first}} company to package each sheet, duvet and pillowcase pair in packaging actually made from sheeting material, which was a clever way to showcase what the pattern <b>really</b> <b>looked</b> like) {{as well as a}} number of innovative and unique towel collections. [...] By the end of the decade, sales dropped and Guess discontinued their home division.|$|E

2500|$|Our debut was at {{a fashion}} show at the [...] "Disco Airport" [...] (Discothèque), which was close to where we practiced in Buenos Aires. Nobody gave us {{so much as a}} nod.

It's much better than putting them on every building in the city." ...|$|E
2500|$|The media {{regularly}} commented and {{joked about}} his style. Oakey pushed his unique style further and began wearing high heeled shoes. He already had both his ears pierced and wore dangling women's diamante earrings. Keen to shock, {{on one of}} the Human League's posters in 1981, Oakey posed shirtless displaying pierced nipples linked together by a gold chain. Oakey says of his early 1980s style: [...] "I deliberately wore clothes that either men or women could wear. But I don't think I ever <b>really</b> <b>looked</b> like a woman. And I never wore very masculine clothes".|$|E

Jimmy Page {{says that}} Link Wray had a [...] "real rebel attitude" [...] and credits him in It Might Get Loud {{as a major}} influence in his early career. According to Rolling Stone, Pete Townshend of The Who once said, [...] "If it hadn't been for Link Wray and 'Rumble,' I never would have picked up a guitar." [...] "The only people I ever <b>really</b> <b>looked</b> up to were Link Wray and Iggy Pop," [...] said Mark E. Smith of The Fall. [...] "Guys like…Link Wray…are very special to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, at age 18, he {{was invited}} to come to Los Angeles to perform on a {{recording}} by one of his Massachusetts friends, John Compton, who was making his first studio album called In California. [...] In an interview 40 years later, Compton said of Elliott, [...] "Bill only needs to hear a song once and he already knows it perfectly. He's like a modern-day Mozart, and <b>really</b> <b>looked</b> the part back then." [...] Soon, Elliott decided to move to Los Angeles. He had some significant early success performing in a country-rock band called The Rowan Brothers, named for Elliott's hometown friends Lorin and Chris Rowan who had moved to California. He performed on their 1972 album The Rowan Brothers, featuring Jerry Garcia and produced by bluegrass mandolinist David Grisman. The band was successful enough to perform as the opening act for The Grateful Dead at San Francisco's Fillmore West in 1971. He also played with other California bands, such as [...] "Seatrain", and [...] "Marblehead".|$|E
2500|$|Between 3 and 4 {{o'clock in}} the {{afternoon}} of the said 29th, it began to rain mud and ashes at Caysasay ( [...] from the volcano) and this rain lasted three days. The most terrifying circumstance was that the whole sky was shrouded in such darkness that we could not have seen the hand placed before the face, {{had it not been for}} the sinister glare of incessant lightnings. Nor could we use artificial light as this was extinguished by the wind and copious ashes which penetrated everywhere. All was horror those three days, which appeared rather like murky nights and we did not occupy ourselves with anything but see to it that the natives swept off the roofs the large quantities of ashes and stones which kept on accumulating upon them and threatened to bring them down upon us, burying us alive beneath their weight. But fearing that even these precautions might prove unavailing, we 3 Europeans – viz. Fr. Prior, the Alcalde, and myself – the only ones who were at the time in the Convento of Caysasay, took refuge on the landing of the stairs; as the safest place, and awaited there whatever God might dispose with regard to us. To all this was added incessant thunder and lightning, and it <b>really</b> <b>looked</b> as if the world was going to pieces and its axis had been displaced.|$|E
