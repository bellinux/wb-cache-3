40|$|Objectives: To {{present a}} case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, Resilon/ RealSeal (RS). To {{determine}} if RS is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show RS degradation. Method and Materials: Emulsions of RS were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. Lipase PS served as a positive control. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested {{for their ability to}} biodegrade RS. The bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for RS degradation for 7 days. Results: Degradation of the emulsified RS manifested in the formation of clear zones around P aeruginosa, P intermedia, P asaccharolytica, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain <b>RS</b> <b>emulsion.</b> Conclusion: Endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade RS. These findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with RS may be impaired by a microbial insult...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe study an {{unstable}} highly concentrated emulsion of water droplets in oil with a nonionic surfactant. A technique of light diffusion coupled to a rheometer allows simultaneous measurement of average droplet radius <b>R</b> and <b>emulsion</b> shear elastic modulus G' during time. Over the studied range of volume fraction (from 71 to 95 %), {{we show that}} Princen and Kiss' (J Colloid Interface Sci 112 : 427 - 437, 1986) model does not apply. A dimensional analysis based on the hypothesis of dominant van der Waals forces is proposed for nonionic surfactants, which is in good agreement with experimental data. We also show that the measured average droplet volume increases linearly with time and that the coalescence rate strongly depends on the volume fraction in relation with different topological conformations of droplets...|$|R
40|$|EN] Paralarval rearing {{constitutes}} the main bottleneck to the complete development of octopus culture. This paper try to optimise the larval rearing conditions of Octopus Paralarvae, testing {{the effect of}} light intensity (1000, 3000 and 6000 lux) over growth and paralarval survival. Four fibber glass tanks, 100 litter capacity with an initial density of 20 ind. /litter were used for each treatment. All light treatments were fed with the same protocol, just hatching Maja Squinado Zoeas and Artemia metanaulios (72 hours) enriched with a commercial <b>emulsion</b> (<b>Red</b> Pepper Paste, Bernaqua, bva; Belgium). Better growth and survival were found with the highest light intensity treatment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEssential oils {{are used}} {{primarily}} as natural preservatives, flavourants and fragrances in cosmetic products. Several pharmacopeias possess monographs of plants which are good sources of essential oils, such as Brazilian Pharmacopeia, including Illicium verum Hook. f., Schisandraceae and Rosmarinus officinalis. Since determination of Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance (HLB) value of essential oils {{appears as a}} critical step for development of emulsions and other semi-solid formulations, evaluation of required HLB values for I. verum and R. officinalis essential oils is {{the aim of this}} study. They were obtained by hydrodistillation and several emulsions were prepared by changing emulsii ers. The couple sorbitan oleate/polysorbate 20 provided best emulsions and was used at different ratios, at a total blend concentration of 5 % w/w. The lowest mean droplet diameters for R. officinalis and I. verum emulsions were obtained at HLB 16. 5 (97. 12 nm) and 16. 7 (246. 6 nm), respectively. Moreover, <b>emulsions</b> with <b>R.</b> officinalis were i ner and presented some bluish rel ection, characteristic of nanoemulsions. The lowest turbidity value for <b>R.</b> officinalis <b>emulsion</b> was also obtained at HLB 16. 5 (0. 33). Thus, the present study describes for the first time HLB values for R. officinalis (16. 5) and I. verum (16. 7) essential oils, contributing to their physicochemical characterization and technology development of phytopharmaceutical...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{nutritional}} therapy on {{the utilization of}} an intravenous fat emulsion was studied in patients with injury, infection, and nutritional depletion using I- 14 C-trioleate labeled Intralipid. The plasma fractional removal rate and 14 C-Intralipid oxidation rate was 55 % ad 25 % higher, respectively, in patients following trauma and during periods of infection receiving 5 % dextrose than in healthy control subjects. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was administered as either 1) nonprotein calories given as glucose (Glucose System) or 2) equal proportions of glucose and intravenous fat emulsion (Lipid System). In comparison to TPN with the Lipid System, administration using the Glucose System resulted in higher plasma clearance rates and lower oxidation rates in both acutely ill and depleted patients. There was no correlation between the rates of plasma removal and oxidation of the intravenous fat <b>emulsion</b> (<b>r</b> = - 0. 04; NS) indicating that the removal of exogenous fat from plasma cannot {{be used as an}} indicator of oxidation. A negative linear relationship was seen between the oxidation rate of intravenous fat and carbohydrate intake (r = - 0. 92; p less than 0. 001). Glucose intakes exceeding energy expenditure did not totally inhibit oxidation of the fat emulsion. The oxidation rate of 14 C-Intralipid was linearly related to net whole body fat oxidation calculated using indirect calorimetry (r = - 0. 90; p less than 0. 001) suggesting that the fat emulsion was oxidized in a similar manner to endogenous lipids. This study suggests that intravenous fat emulsions are utilized as an energy substrate in patients with major injury, infection or nutritional depletion. This observation, along with a relative unresponsiveness to glucose in surgical patients suggests that fat emulsions may be useful as a calorie source in patients receiving parenteral nutrition...|$|R
40|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} measurement of meat quality {{is essential for}} the Australian beef industry to remain competitive in both the domestic and export markets. Recent developments of the resonator technique have lead to the commercial availability of the High Resolution Ultrasound Spectroscope (HR-US). This research project was designed to assess the potential of HR-US for the analysis of post-mortem bovine muscle. This was accomplished by; 1) establishing a suitable measurement protocol that considered sources of variability, 2) the effects of post-mortem aging on HR-US parameters, 3) analysis of thermal related changes that occur in muscle, and extracted connective tissue during heating, and 4) the use of HR-US for the measurement of the intramuscular fat. A procedure for the measurement of bovine muscle with HR-US was established. Briefly, an external semisolid cell was used as the measurement cell. The frequency range of 2000 KHz to 3000 KHz was selected as the most suitable for whole muscle analysis and all five resonance peaks within this range were analysed and used to obtain velocity and attenuation values of the meat sample. Water was used as the reference media, and measurements were conducted at 250 C. Changes were made to this method during experimental work depending on the sample being run and the objectives of the study. The measurement protocol was shown to be repeatable. Factors likely to cause variation in measurements of the samples, such as water loss and freeze-thaw, were also considered when developing the operational parameters of the study. High resolution ultrasound spectroscopy was applied to measure the post-mortem changes that occur in bovine muscle. Using two muscle types, Semitendinosus and Psoas major, significant changes were observed in HR-US parameters with ageing. Significant increases in the acoustic impedance of bovine muscle with increased ageing time were attributed to degradation of the muscle structure. This was confirmed in transmission electron microscopy images where clear disruption the myofibillar structure was apparent in the muscle at 21 days post-mortem. In localised regions the Z bands and the adjoining actin fibres were totally degraded. Water loss from the muscle system had a significant influence on HR-US measurements. Thermal related changes that occur in whole bovine muscle and in isolated intramuscular connective tissue were observed with HR-US. Heat induced changes were identified in whole muscles and included the melting of the fat within samples at 48 oC, coagulation of sarcoplasmic proteins between 450 C and 55 oC, and the shrinkage of collagen fibres at 630 C. An 80 % reduction in the attenuating properties of extracted connective ageing in buffer solution was observed within the first 5 days. This is attributed to the degradation of proteoglycans and the resulting disassociation of collagen fibrils. Structural changes occurring in extracted connective tissue were observed with TEM. HR-US measurements proved to be highly sensitive to identifying temperatures at which transitions occurred. Unfolding of the triple helix structure of collagen was identified in velocity transitions between 59 Â°C and 63 oC. HR-US results suggested a greater sensitivity to thermal related changes in extracted intramuscular connective tissue when compared with differential scanning calorimeter results. An increase in temperature was observed for thermal denaturation of collagen with ageing, however a reduction was also observed in the temperature range at which the denaturation process occurred. Temperature ramps conducted on extracted intramuscular bovine showed a reduction in velocity from 1613. 1 m/s at 250 C to 1343. 1 m/s at 900 C equalling an overall reduction in velocity of 270 m/s. A transition in the velocity trend seen at 46 Â°C indicates the majority of the triglycerides are melted (or in liquid state) above this temperature. Results are confirmed with differential scanning calorimeter thermogram. HR-US measurements showed high sensitivity to increasing concentration of bovine fat in prepared emulsions with an adjusted R 2 99. 46 % for velocity measurements taken at 5100 kHz. Attenuation values at 8100 kHz also showed a strong linear response to increasing fat concentration in the <b>emulsion</b> (<b>R</b> 2 98. 77). The use of HR-US for the measurement of intramuscular bovine fat demonstrated a high sensitivity to extracted bovine fat in prepared emulsions. An increase in the intramuscular fat content of whole bovine muscles resulted in a reduction in the velocity measurements and an increase in the attenuation of the ultrasonic signal. This provides the basis for potential method for the prediction intramuscular fat in bovine muscle. The present studies have highlighted the complexities of investigations relating to meat quality and have demonstrated the diversity of data required to assess quality. Only when comprehensive data are available, can we hope to accurately determine meat quality and predict how it will vary with changes in animal production and meat processing...|$|R
