5|$|The central {{mass of the}} Raft River Mountains {{consists}} of Precambrian metamorphic rocks with Elba quartzite and interlayered schist on the southern slopes and Cambrian quartzite outcrops on {{the western part of}} the range. Below the Sublett Mountains the Phosphoria Formation, a basal phosphorite overlain by a thick sequence of chert and cherty sandstone, reaches its greatest thickness. Soils in the northern part of the forest are generally deep and highly fertile in lowlands but shallow and less so on steep slopes. In the Minidoka <b>Ranger</b> <b>District,</b> soils are generally productive, derived from volcanic and sedimentary material, shallow on steep slopes, and deep in the lowlands.|$|E
25|$|In 1877, two prospectors, Hank Smith and William Curry, {{discovered}} {{silver in}} present-day Silverado Canyon. Several mines immediately sprang {{up in the}} area, the largest of which {{was known as the}} Blue Light Mine. During this period, the town of Silverado rose at the confluence of Silverado Creek and Santiago Creek and the boom continued for over three years. Although the height of the mining was in the three or four years following the discovery of silver, smaller-scale mining continued for decades after the initial boom had ended. The last commercial operations at the Blue Light Mine ceased in the 1940s. The mine has continued to issue small amounts of toxic tailings, including arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury, remediation for which the Trabuco <b>Ranger</b> <b>District</b> of the Cleveland National Forest began toxic cleanup in 2008.|$|E
25|$|South of Chadron {{the highway}} passes through Chadron State Park in the Pine Ridge <b>Ranger</b> <b>District</b> of the Nebraska National Forest. This area {{is part of}} an {{escarpment}} that lies between the Niobrara and White Rivers. Forested buttes, ridges and canyons have been carved into the high tableland. Sharing similarities with the Black Hills, the area is forested with Ponderosa Pine and contains a variation of wildlife such as bighorn sheep, elk, and mule deer, which are not common elsewhere in the state. The highway then enters Chadron where it joins US20 along {{the west side of the}} city. It runs concurrently with US 20 to the west for two miles before departing to the north. US385 then passes the Chadron Municipal Airport before turning to the northwest where it reaches the South Dakota state line. From there it continues north into the Black Hills towards Deadwood, South Dakota.|$|E

500|$|The Forest Reserve Act of 1891 {{gave the}} President the {{authority}} to establish forest reserves in the U.S. Department of the Interior. After passage of the Transfer Act of 1905, forest reserves {{became part of the}} U.S. Department of Agriculture in the newly created U.S. Forest Service. Sawtooth National Forest was created as the Sawtooth Forest Reserve in the Department of Agriculture by proclamation of President Theodore Roosevelt on May 29, 1905. The forest's initial area was , and it was named after the Sawtooth Mountains in the northwestern part of the forest. On November 6, 1906, President Roosevelt announced the addition of [...] to the Sawtooth Forest Reserve, which then also constituted much of the present-day Salmon-Challis and Boise National Forests. These lands were split into separate National Forests by executive order on June 26 and July 1, 1908. The forest's area underwent a number of smaller changes in the early 20thcentury. The Fairfield <b>Ranger</b> <b>District</b> was established in 1906 and merged with the Shake Creek <b>Ranger</b> <b>District</b> in 1972 to form the present-day Fairfield District. The Cassia Forest Reserve was established on June 12, 1905 and the Raft River Forest Reserve on November 5, 1906. The names of the forest reserves were changed to national forests on March 4, 1907. Formed from the consolidation of Cassia and Raft River National Forests, the Minidoka National Forest was created on July 1, 1908 and then added to Sawtooth National Forest on July 1, 1953.|$|E

500|$|There are an {{estimated}} [...] of perennial and intermittent streams and [...] of lakes and reservoirs in the forest. The Forest Service provides access to and recreation opportunities at the seven reservoirs it borders, although it does not own or manage them. There are numerous natural lakes in the forest, {{most of which are}} tarns created by alpine glaciers during the Pleistocene. The largest, Warm Lake, is 26 miles (42km) east of Cascade in Valley County; many of the smaller lakes are in the Trinity and West mountains. Annual water yield on the forest is estimated at 4.1 million acre-feet (5.1 × 109 m3). The southern portion of the forest is drained by the Boise River, the central and western portions by the Payette River, northeastern portion by the Salmon River, and far western portions of the Emmett <b>Ranger</b> <b>District</b> by the Weiser River. All four rivers are tributaries of the Snake River, which itself is a tributary of the Columbia River in the Pacific basin.|$|E
500|$|Boise National Forest is home {{to three}} of Idaho's scenic byways, {{all of which are}} paved {{highways}} accessible to roadworthy vehicles.

The Ponderosa Pine Scenic Byway is a [...] road between Stanley and Boise following Idaho State Highway 21. This route passes over Arrowrock Reservoir and through Idaho City and Lowman, where it connects with the Wildlife Canyon Byway.

The [...] Sawtooth Primitive Area became the Sawtooth Wilderness (also in the SNRA) as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System under the Wilderness Act of 1964. The original bill also authorized $19.8 million ($ today) for land acquisition and up to $26 million ($ today) for development. The SNRA was dedicated in a ceremony held on the shores of Redfish Lake on September 1, 1972. The Burley and Twin Falls Ranger Districts of Sawtooth National Forest were consolidated on October 16, 2002 into the Minidoka <b>Ranger</b> <b>District.</b> On August 7, 2015 President Obama signed the Sawtooth National Recreation Area and Jerry Peak Wilderness Additions Act to create the Hemingway–Boulders, Jim McClure–Jerry Peak, and White Clouds wilderness areas, which cover a total of [...] of central Idaho, primarily in Sawtooth National Forest.|$|E

500|$|Sawtooth National Forest has {{an active}} Fire Management Program which {{recognize}}s that forest fires are {{a natural part}} of the ecosystem, but this was not always the case. The 1987 forest plan did not recognize fire as an ecosystem process or as a tool for ecosystem management; this was rectified in the 2012 forest plan. Previous firefighting efforts, which emphasized quickly extinguishing all fires, caused dead and dying trees to accumulate well in excess of the level found when fires are allowed to burn out naturally. Historically speaking, fires became more common in parts of the SNRA after the development of lodgepole pine forests, which occurred prior to 1450AD. Between 1989 and 1998 there were on average 50 fires per year, with 58 percent of them caused by lightning. The Smoky Mountains of Idaho were named from the frequent forest fires, and in 2007 the Castle Rock Fire burned [...] of the Smoky Mountains near Ketchum. In 2005 the Valley Road Fire burned [...] in the White Cloud Mountains after being ignited from embers that came from a trash barrel which were blown out on a windy day. In August 2013 the Beaver Creek Fire and the Kelley Fire were both ignited by lightning and burned [...] and , respectively, of the Fairfield and Ketchum ranger districts. Another lightning-caused fire, the McCan Fire, burned [...] of the Fairfield <b>Ranger</b> <b>District</b> and other lands north of Fairfield in 2013. Both natural and prescribed fires are used as a tool to maintain desired vegetation and fuel levels. While the forest's fire plan operates within historical fire regimes, locally fire is actively suppressed to protect human life, investments, and resources.|$|E
