40|$|A {{total of}} 29 men 60 {{years and older}} (mean age 74 years) who complained at least once about nocturnal voiding and were {{diagnosed}} with nocturnal polyuria in the frequency volume chart (FVC) were enrolled in this study. Body water was measured by bioelectric impedance analysis just after lying down at 4 pm and after <b>raising</b> <b>legs</b> 30 minutes later. Nocturnal urine production was measured by FVC, and urine production per unit of time at first nocturnal voiding (urine volume at first nocturnal voiding/hours of undisturbed sleep (HUS) : UFN/HUS), urine production per unit of time during sleep (total nocturnal urine volume/hours of sleep : TNV/HS), etc was evaluated. Extra cellular water (ECW) of 0. 19 l (4. 0 %) in legs was reduced caused by body position changing. There was a significant positive correlation {{between the amount of}} ECW in legs and UFN/HUS, TNV/HS (r＝ 0. 57, p＝ 0. 001; r＝ 0. 38, p＝ 0. 042, respectively). Moreover, UFN/HUS had a significant correlation with soft lean mass in legs, ECW in legs and daytime water intake. This study suggested that a change in leg fluids caused by a change in position results in increased urine production and decreased HUS...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Background and Objectives: Lumbar {{spondylosis}} and prolapsed inter vertebral disc {{can cause}} {{low back pain}} with or without radiculopathy. Mulligan has described the traction straight <b>leg</b> <b>raise</b> (TSLR) and bent <b>leg</b> <b>raise</b> (BLR) techniques, which are said to improve range of motion of hip flexion in patients with low back pain. The objectives {{of the present study}} were to compare the effectiveness of Mulligan’s Traction Straight <b>Leg</b> <b>Raise</b> and Bent <b>Leg</b> <b>Raise</b> in low back ache with radiculopathy. Materials and Methods: 40 participants with clinical diagnosis and radiological evidence of Lumbar spondylosis with radiation or low back pain (LBP) with radiculopathy, with limitation of Straight <b>Leg</b> <b>Raise</b> angle between 300 to 700 were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups of 20 each. Physical therapy treatment protocol which included Mulligan’s TSLR and BLR techniques with common treatment of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) were given for 6 days. Conclusion and Interpretation: The randomized clinical trial provided evidence to support the use of Mulligan’s TSLR and BLR techniques in relieving pain, improving hip flexion (SLR) range of motion and improving functional well being. In addition Mulligan’s Bent <b>Leg</b> <b>Raise</b> can be of great value in improving physical function in LBP with radiculopathy...|$|R

40|$|Background: Chronic {{low back}} pain is a common problem in the present time. It is {{commonly}} associated with altered mechanical tension in the peripheral nerves as tested by straight <b>leg</b> <b>raising</b> or slump tests. These maneuvers are used for treatment of such disorders. Both the straight <b>leg</b> <b>raise</b> and slump stretching techniques {{have been found to}} be beneficial in the treatment of {{low back pain}} with distal symptoms. A comparison of the two techniques will determine if one technique is better than the other. Also, it will add to the evidence for their effectiveness in managing symptoms in patients with low back pain. Objective: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of straight <b>leg</b> <b>raise</b> and slump stretching on pain and range of passive straight <b>leg</b> <b>raise</b> in subjects with low back pain. Methods and measures: 50 patients with low back pain, satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to three groups. Group 1 was the straight <b>leg</b> <b>raise</b> group (n= 15). Group 2 was the slump group (n= 13). Group 3 was the control group (n= 12). Baseline measurements of pain intensity as measured by the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and range of passive straight <b>leg</b> <b>raise</b> (PSLR) were taken. Group 1 received 6 sessions of straight <b>leg</b> <b>raise</b> stretching and lumbar stabilization exercises. Group 2 received 6 sessions of slump stretching and lumbar stabilization exercises. Group 3 received 6 sessions of lumbar stabilization exercises only. Statistical analysis: Paired t-test was used for within group analysis of NPRS and PSLR. ANOVA followed by post hoc analysis was employed for between group comparisons. Results: No significant difference was found in NPRS between straight <b>leg</b> <b>raise</b> and slump groups (p > 0. 05) while they differed significantly in PSLR (p < 0. 05). Both the groups showed significantly better results in PSLR when compared to the control group (P< 0. 05). Statistically significant improvements were found in all the 3 groups for both the outcome measures in comparison to the baseline (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: From the results of the study, it can be concluded that both straight <b>leg</b> <b>raise</b> and slump stretching are equally effective in reducing pain in patients with low back pain with associated adverse neural tension. Slump stretching is better than straight <b>leg</b> <b>raise</b> stretching in improving the range of passive straight <b>leg</b> <b>raise.</b> Based on patient needs, a treatment program may be formulated using any one or both the techniques. They may be added to conventional treatment protocols as they are better in improving range of passive straight <b>leg</b> <b>raise...</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} functional hemodynamic {{response to}} passive <b>leg</b> <b>raising</b> in healthy {{pregnant women and}} compare it with non-pregnant controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional study with a case-control design. A total of 108 healthy pregnant women at 22 - 24 weeks of gestation and 54 non-pregnant women were included. Cardiac function and systemic hemodynamics were studied at baseline and 90 seconds after passive <b>leg</b> <b>raising</b> using non-invasive impedance cardiography. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Trends and magnitudes of changes in impedance cardiography derived parameters of cardiac function and systemic hemodynamics caused by passive <b>leg</b> <b>raising,</b> and preload responsiveness defined as > 10 % increase in stroke volume or cardiac output after passive <b>leg</b> <b>raising</b> compared to baseline. RESULTS: The hemodynamic parameters in both pregnant and non-pregnant women changed significantly during passive <b>leg</b> <b>raising</b> compared to baseline, but the magnitude and trend of change was similar in both groups. The stroke volume increased both in pregnant (p =  0. 042) and non-pregnant (p =  0. 018) women, whereas the blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance decreased (p< 0. 001) following passive <b>leg</b> <b>raising</b> in both groups. Only 14. 8 % of pregnant women and 18. 5 % of non-pregnant women were preload responsive {{and the difference between}} groups was not significant (p =  0. 705). CONCLUSION: Static measures of cardiovascular status are different between healthy pregnant and non-pregnant women, but the physiological response to passive <b>leg</b> <b>raising</b> is similar and not modified by pregnancy at 22 - 24 weeks of gestation. Whether physiological response to passive <b>leg</b> <b>raising</b> is different in earlier and later stages of pregnancy merit further investigation...|$|R
