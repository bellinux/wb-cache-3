40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{performed}} to determine the quantitative relation existing between action <b>potential</b> and <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> of the lobster giant axon. <b>Resting</b> <b>potential</b> changes were induced by either increasing the external potassium concentration or by reducing the external calcium concentration. For either treatment the action potential amplitude {{is proportional to the}} logarithm of the <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> minus a constant. This constant is equivalent to the minimum <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> at which a propagated spike is possible, and is larger for depolarization in low calcium than in high potassium. Thus the change in action potential per unit change in <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> is greater in low external calcium than in high external potassium. Analog computer solutions to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations for squid axon membrane potentials show that, if the initial conditions are properly specified, the action potential is proportional to the logarithm of the potassium potential minus a constant.

40|$|The {{contributions}} of specific K+ currents to the <b>resting</b> membrane <b>potential</b> of rabbit isolated, pulmonary artery myocytes, and their modulation by hypoxia, were investigated {{by use of}} the whole-cell, patch-clamp technique. In the presence of 10 [*]μM glibenclamide the <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> (− 50 ± 4 [*]mV, n= 18) was unaffected by 10 [*]μM tetraethylammonium ions, 200 [*]nM charybdotoxin, 200 [*][*]nM iberiotoxin, 100 [*]μM ouabain or 100 [*]μM digitoxin. The negative potential was therefore maintained without ATP-sensitive (KATP) or large conductance Ca 2 +-sensitive (BKCa) K channels, and without the Na+-K+ATPase. The <b>resting</b> <b>potential,</b> the delayed rectifier current (IK(V)) and the A-like K+ current (IK(A)) were all reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) and by quinine. 4 -AP was equally potent at reducing the <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> and IK(V), 10 [*]mM causing depolarization from − 44 [*]mV to − 22 [*]mV with accompanying inhibition of IK(V) by 56 % and IK(A) by 79 %. In marked contrast, the effects of quinine on <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> were poorly correlated with its effects on both IK(A) and IK(V). At 10 [*]mM, quinine reduced IK(V) and IK(A) by 47 % and 38 %, respectively, with {{no change in the}} <b>resting</b> <b>potential.</b> At 100 [*]μM, both currents were almost abolished while the <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> was reduced < 50 %. Raising the concentration to 1 [*]mM had little further effect on IK(A) or IK(V), but essentially abolished the <b>resting</b> <b>potential.</b> Reduction of the <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> by quinine was correlated with inhibition of a voltage-gated, low threshold, non-inactivating K+ current, IK(N). Thus, 100 [*]μM quinine reduced both IK(N) and the <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> by around 50 %. The <b>resting</b> membrane <b>potential</b> was the same whether measured after clamping the cell at − 80 [*]mV, or immediately after a prolonged period of depolarization at 0 [*]mV, which inactivated IK(A) and IK(V), but not IK(N). When exposed to a hypoxic solution, the O 2 tension near the cell fell from 125 ± 6 to 14 ± 2 [*]mmHg (n= 20), resulting in a slow depolarization of the myocyte membrane to − 35 ± 3 [*]mV (n= 16). The depolarization occurred without a change in the amplitude of IK(V) or IK(A), but it was accompanied by 60 % inhibition of IK(N) at 0 [*]mV.

50|$|The <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> must be {{established}} within a cell before the cell can be depolarized. There are many mechanisms by which a cell can establish a <b>resting</b> <b>potential,</b> however there is a typical pattern of generating this <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> that many cells follow. The cell uses ion channels, ion pumps, and voltage gated ion channels to generate a negative <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> within the cell. However, the process of generating the <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> within the cell also creates an environment outside of the cell that favors depolarization. The sodium potassium pump is {{largely responsible for the}} optimization of conditions on both the interior and the exterior of the cell for depolarization. By pumping three positively charged sodium ions (Na+) out of the cell for every two positively charged potassium ions (K+) pumped into the cell, not only is the <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> of the cell established, but an unfavorable concentration gradient is created by increasing the concentration of sodium outside of the cell and increasing the concentration of potassium within the cell. Although there is an excessive amount of potassium in the cell and sodium outside of the cell, the generated <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> keeps the voltage gated ion channels in the plasma membrane closed, preventing the ions that have been pumped across the plasma membrane from diffusing to an area of lower concentration. Additionally, despite the high concentration of positively-charged potassium ions, most cells contain internal components (of negative charge), which accumulate to establish a negative inner-charge.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{develops}} {{a model for}} a single cell electroporated by an external electric field and uses it to investigate the effects of shock strength and <b>rest</b> <b>potential</b> on the transmembrane potential Vm and pore density N around the cell. As compared to the induced potential predicted by resistive-capacitive theory, the model of electroporation predicts a smaller magnitude of Vm throughout the cell. Both Vm and N are symmetric about the equator with the same value at both poles of the cell. Larger shocks do not increase the maximum magnitude of Vm because more pores form to shunt the excess stimulus current across the membrane. In addition, the value of the <b>rest</b> <b>potential</b> does not affect Vm around the cell because the electroporation current is several orders of magnitude larger than the ionic current that supports the <b>rest</b> <b>potential.</b> Once the field is removed, the shock-induced Vm discharges within 2 μs, but the pores persist in the membrane for several seconds. Complete resealing to preshock conditions requires approximately 20 s.
