30|$|Hydrogenated multilayers (MLs) of a-Si/a-Ge {{have been}} {{analysed}} {{to establish the}} reasons of H release during annealing that has been seen to bring about structural modifications even up to well-detectable surface degradation. Analyses carried out on single layers of a-Si and a-Ge show that H is <b>released</b> <b>from</b> its <b>bond</b> <b>to</b> the host lattice atom and that it escapes from the layer much more efficiently in a-Ge than in a-Si because of the smaller binding energy of the H-Ge bond and probably of a greater weakness of the Ge lattice.

Sabu could only be <b>released</b> <b>from</b> his <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> wrestle his matches. Sabu also quickly became synonymous with table-breaking at this time; if a table was not broken during the match, Sabu would break a table with his own body after the bell had sounded, sometimes leading to 911 having to restrain Sabu during backstage interviews if a table was present.|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the structure and of the hydrogen bonding configuration in hydrogenated a-Si/a-Ge multilayers prepared by RF sputtering is analyzed {{as a function of}} annealing. Single layers are also investigated to better evaluate the H behavior. IR absorption measurements show that H is <b>released</b> <b>from</b> its <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> Si and Ge upon annealing. The mono-hydrides already disappear to a large extent for low annealing times (1 and 4 h), being replaced by di-hydrides, {{especially in the case of}} Si. For 10 h annealing both mono- and di-hydrides are almost completely destroyed. At the same time surface blisters form which, for the same annealing conditions, increase in size with increasing incorporated H in the as-deposited sample. It is concluded that the blisters in the multilayers are due to the trapping of the released H in cavities that increase in size upon annealing. The enlarged inner surface of the cavities is the candidate site for the formation of the di-hydrides at low annealing times, i. e., when the thermal energy supplied by the annealing is still insufficient to break all of them...|$|R

40|$|Semiconductor {{structures}} {{based on}} Si and Ge are generally submitted to hydrogenation because H passivates the dangling bonds of Si and Ge. By {{this way the}} devices prepared from those semiconductors, e. g., solar cells, have much better electrical properties. However, H stability is still a critical issue. In fact, there is wide evidence that H is very unstable against illumination as well as heat treatment. It has been seen that H out effuses from the samples under such treatments. As this causes unsaturation of the dangling bonds the electrical properties worsen significantly. In this work we will show {{that in the case}} of ultrathin Si/Ge amorphous layers the H thermal instability also affects the structural stability even up to the micrometric scale depending on the H content. Such type of structure can also be used to prepare SiGe alloys by mixing the layers with heat treatments. The samples were amorphous multilayers (MLs) of alternating ultrathin (3 nm) layers of Si and Ge deposited by sputtering on (100) oriented Si substrate. The total thickness of the MLs was 300 nm. The samples were hydrogenated by introducing H in the sputter chamber with flow rates varying from 0. 8 to 6 ml/min. The MLs underwent different heat treatments, from the one at 350 ?C for 1 h up to the one at 250 ?C for 0. 5 h + 450 ?C for 5 h. The samples were analysed by AFM, TEM, energy filtering TEM and Small-Angle X-Ray Diffraction (SAXRD). AFM showed that upon annealing the structure of the samples degrades with formation of surface bumps whose size increases by increasing the annealing temperature and/or time, for the same H content, or by increasing the H content for the same annealing conditions. For high H content and/or annealing conditions AFM showed that the bumps have blown up giving rise to craters. This suggests that H was <b>released</b> <b>from</b> its dangling <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> Si and Ge and formed H bubbles in the MLs because of the energy supplied by the annealing. Additional energy for the break of the Si-H and Ge-H bonds could be the one supplied by the recombination of thermally generated carriers associated with the band gap fluctuations caused by the not uniform distribution of H in the MLs. The first sites of H accumulation are very likely nanocavities certainly present in the amorphous MLs. By TEM it has been seen that layer intermixing occurred which could be the first step of H bubbles formation. SAXRD measurements as well as TEM energy filtering maps for Si and Ge showed that Si and Ge interdiffusion took place in an asymmetric way as Si was seen to diffuse to the Ge layers whereas Ge did not diffuse to the Si layers. This might be due to the higher density of free dangling bonds in the Ge layers created by annealing because the binding energy of the Ge-H bond is smaller than the one of the Si-H bond...|$|R
