A general lack of information about municipal regulations and their enforcement was also discerned among the small businesses interviewed. The most significant distinctions of four categories of micro, very small, small and medium enterprise are as follows: – Micro survivalist and micro non-survivalist businesses also classified as the informal sector. This category requires a specialised focus through standardised regulations and transparent and predictable service delivery arrangements. Where possible, targeted support for certain, highly viable micro businesses could assist them in becoming formalised and graduate to the very small status. – Very small businesses are {{on the threshold of}} becoming more established, small or medium enterprises.

NZEB means a building that has a very high energy performance, and the very low amount of energy required should be covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, including CHP. The actual promotion of renewable energies and distributed generation obliges to review the traditional 'load-driven' 'top-down' power system. Electric demand side management (DSM) focuses on changing the electricity consumption patterns of end-use customers through improving energy efficiency and optimizing allocation of power. Demand response (DR) is a DSM solution that targets residential and commercial customers, and is developed for demand reduction or demand shifting at a specific time for a specific duration. Renewable power and CHP systems can be sized and managed more efficiently for loads of tens of kVA, more than an individual consumer. So, it is necessary for small and medium consumers, to aggregate their load profile in order to reach a threshold value of some ten of kW and a more demand flexibility like the Heating System where a unique boiler supplies more efficiently the building. The actual regulatory rules don't permit the aggregation of consumers in a unique Point of Delivery POD.

The report argued that large inequities in access to certified teachers for poor and minority students are not a problem because research linking teacher education to student achievement is flawed. In July, 2002, the U. S. Secretary of Education cited the Abell Foundation paper in his Annual Report on Teacher Quality as the sole source for concluding that teacher education does not contribute to teacher effectiveness. The Secretary's report then recommended that requirements for education coursework be eliminated from certification standards, and attendance at schools of education and student teaching be made optional. This article documents the many inaccuracies in the Abell Foundation paper and describes the actual findings {{of many of the}} studies it purports to review, as well as the findings of other studies it ignores.

Complex blood flow patterns in hemodynamically challenged sites in the circulatory system correlate with sites of atherosclerotic plaque formation, implicating blood flow mechanics in regional endothelial function. This dissertation investigated, at the basic science and cellular level, the mechanosensitivity of endothelial cells in vitro to temporal gradients of shear stress and explored the role the plasma membrane system as a mechanism of mechanotransduction. ^ A microscope mounted controlled cell shearing device was developed to deliver hydrodynamically-applied shear stress profiles to cultured endothelium similar to blood flow-induced conditions in vivo. To investigate the effects of the temporal gradients of shear stress on EC response, simultaneous changes in intracellular free calcium (Ca 2 +i) concentrations in response to changes in the initial shear stress rate (or rise time) were monitored. ^ Upon the onset of the stimulus, an immediate biphasic activation of Ca 2 +i was elicited and displayed sensitivity in the loading rate and magnitude of shear stress. In these experiments, shear stress stimulated the release of calcium from intracellular storage sites in the endoplasmic reticulum through a phosphatidylinositol (4, 5) -bisphosphate- mediated pathway. Extracellular Ca 2 + modulated the response, while its entry following the stimulatory period was activated and required for sustained Ca 2 +i. This study has identified either transmembrane proteins or the plasma membrane, or both, as an upstream mechanosensor in this transduction pathway. ^ To investigate the role of the membrane system in mechanotransduction, EC membranes were successfully enriched with cholesterol and showed a selective up-take that was dependent on the exposure time of the cholesterol solution to static cultures. Experimental work demonstrated that selectively altering the cholesterol composition in the membrane caused a dose-dependent attenuation in the peak [Ca 2 +]i at physiologic loading conditions. ^ Collectively, these data identified a potential role for the membrane system in mechanotransduction of shear stress induced Ca 2 +i response in vitro. In conclusion, local hemodynamics may act as modulator of endothelium response leading to distinct physiological and pathophysiological states. ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 The recent {{development}} experience of modern economies demonstrates the increasing role and impacts of financial activities on {{regional and national}} economic systems, effects which remain largely overlooked by current theory and empirical work. This dissertation contributes to this gap in knowledge by addressing the geographical flow of capital into commercial real estate markets. Three main research questions are addressed: (1) does capital flow freely over space into commercial real estate markets in accordance with neo-classical expectations of market equilibrium or is the flow spatially uneven? (2) how and why have spatial patterns of capital flows changed over time, and (3) {{what are the implications}} of these changing spatial on local commercial real estate markets and regional economies? To answer these questions, the dissertation develops a theoretical framework to describe the decisions made by investors in their allocation of funds to particular places. This framework begins with a neo-classical process driven by spatial differences in rates of return on assets. Then, additional components are added which modify this simple process, including barriers and costs of distance, management of risk and uncertainty, organizational characteristics, industry specific factors and norms, path dependence, serendipity, and shocks and long-term structural change. Spatial outcomes are then tested empirically through analysis of investment behaviors by institutional, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and foreign investors in the US over the 1980 to 1996 period. This evidence shows a high degree of spatial differentiation amongst these players in their investment and also demonstrates a dispersal of capital to smaller metropolitan areas. In addition, there is a convergence of capitalization rates across regions. Empirical work in Stockholm Sweden illustrates the dramatic effects of a <b>regulatory</b> <b>barrier</b> on local property markets and the regional and national financial system in addition to the channeled flow of investment, particularly to central London, when these barriers were suddenly removed. The dissertation concludes that structural change and shocks have led to the dispersal of capital across places, yet there is no end to geography, as changes in individual and organizational behavior and increasing financial complexity will never allow a state of spatial equilibrium...|$|E

First one is to know <b>Regulatory</b> <b>barrier</b> given by government over Tobacco Industry. Second one is communication barriers faced by British American Tobacco Bangladesh because of this regulatory restriction and third one is how CSR activities of British American Tobacco Bangladesh help in overcoming the communication barrier. Basically in order to complete my Internship program for my graduation, I had a wonderful experience working {{for a period of}} three months in the British American Tobacco Bangladesh. First part of this report is based on the introduction which includes topics like origin, objective, background, methodology, limitation of the study. Basically it defines the way and background of the study to prepare the report. The next part of the report highlights a brief about British American Tobacco Bangladesh and its history, its products, shareholders, distribution network. In {{the main part of the}} report, I explain the Tobacco Law that has restricted tobacco industry to go for any sort of promotion, advertisement or mass communication. Next, I explain the consequence of these laws. Later on I have explained the current CSR activities done by BAT Bangladesh. Finally I have tried to explain the benefits BATB is getting from their CSR initiatives. Succeeding, I have also tried to figure out how CSR activities of BATB help in reduce the communication barrier and acts as an alternative medium of mass communication. I have also tried to explain costs and benefits of the CSR initiatives depending on the perspective of different stakeholders of BATB. At the end of the report, some recommendations are given which could be helpful for the proper understanding of the report.

40|$|AbstractThe highly contentious, complex {{negotiations}} {{over the past}} several years to establish a globally more-inclusive, post-Kyoto Framework illustrate the daunting complexity and diversity of interests, which had to be accommodated. Notwithstanding the many challenges, a “Copenhagen Accord” was reached at the December 2009 15 th Conference of Parties (COP 15) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Copenhagen, Denmark. That Accord provided the basis for subsequent delineation of the post-Kyoto Framework in 2010 at the meetings in Mexico City, Mexico. Adoption of more flexibility in the approaches nations can employ to achieve significant, verifiable emissions reductions is among the many critical and necessary accommodations made to achieve more inclusive participation from developing economies and other large economies that did not adhere to the Kyoto Protocol. Negotiations also had to address trade and national sovereignty issues as well. This flexibility is an essential recognition of national and cultural differences including differences in levels of national and sub-national economic wealth and growth, status of energy infrastructure development, and national energy resource endowments. This paper presents research findings from a project using a step-by-step methodology. The first step was defining a set of generic, guiding principles for economically efficient and effective national emissions reduction programs. These were employed to design a comprehensive portfolio of innovative national policy and technology strategies that could be adopted by large, developed economies as well as some large developing economies. A specific example is presented using the United States as the test case. The cost-effectiveness of the innovative policy and technology portfolio is assessed for the test case based on a number of effectiveness measures, including: projected economic impacts and emissions reductions, national security impacts, energy-related impacts on water use and other environmental aspects, and regional economic equity. The assessment methodology employs a Reference Case Scenario (RCS), based on the Annual Energy Outlook 2010 energy projections (AEO 2010) of the U. S. Energy Information Agency (EIA), extended through 2050. The EIA energy projections are a widely used basis for projecting future energy demand, supply, and prices in the United States. They provide a comprehensive economy-wide reference data set. Particular attention is given to the electric generation, transportation, and industrial sectors, which account for the majority of energy production, demand, and emissions. A Policy and Technology Innovations Scenario (PTIS) is constructed covering all sectors of the energy economy with special attention as described above. The case specifications include new Federal and State legislative innovations and modifications to existing laws, regulatory reforms and innovations, and enhanced low-carbon technology innovation programs. Based on the PTIS case specifications, the incremental energy, economic, emissions, and other impacts from successful adoption and implementation of the PTIS case are projected as changes to the Reference Case Scenario using transparent techno-economic modeling approaches. The enhanced, low-carbon energy technology innovations programs included in the PTIS case cover a broad spectrum of energy supply and demand innovations. Particular attention is given to innovations that increase energy efficiency in both production and uses of energy in all economic sectors. Recognizing the extremely large energy infrastructure and imbedded capital investments already existing in the United States, special attention is given to innovations to transform and expand that infrastructure to meet future clean energy needs. The latter is a key strategy for making the transition affordable. One focus of attention is innovative opportunities for Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS). These are described along with the policy, regulatory, and technology improvements necessary to enable those contributions. The quantitative and qualitative differences between the two Scenarios are compared using the effectiveness measures adopted. These comparisons confirm that a portfolio such as that modeled in this project can lead to significant, affordable emissions reductions in the near term, and establish a pathway to a future energy economy with much larger reductions in energy use and emissions than the Reference Case in the longer term. Other key insights and conclusions from the assessment are described. The national and sub-national political, economic, and <b>regulatory</b> <b>barrier</b> and constraint challenges to successful implementation of a PTIS case are presented along with options for overcoming those challenges...|$|E
