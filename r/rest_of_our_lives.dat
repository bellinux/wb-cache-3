500|$|Leading {{up to the}} event, The Portland Mercury Erik Henriksen {{encouraged}} {{readers to}} join the march, writing: [...] "Trump's hostility to science isn't just an attack on humankind's accumulated knowledge—it's an attack on all of us, and its repercussions will affect everyone on Earth, every day, for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives.</b> Time to fight back." [...] KOIN said organizers portrayed the demonstration as [...] "political but not partisan, promoting the understanding of science as well as defending it from various attacks, including proposed U.S. government budget cuts under President Donald Trump". Similarly, Maggie Vespa of KGW said, [...] "Although organizers trumpeted the event's 'nonpartisan' platform, participants in Portland were quick to take aim at President Trump's proposed funding cuts to scientific research agencies." ...|$|E

They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then we spent the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E

40|$|Part of the Volume on the Ecology of Games: Connecting Youth, Games, and Learning The {{focus of}} this chapter is on how young people learn to play video games. We have {{approached}} this question ethnographically, studying young people playing {{in their own homes}} among friends and family. The primary data analyzed for the chapter are videorecordings of play from two perspectives [...] in-game and in-room [...] which we synchronized into a single side-by-side video record. By looking at in-room actions along with in-game actions, the chapter expands on a separate worlds view that holds video games as a world apart from the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> kids' <b>lives.</b> <b>Our</b> case material shows instead how game play is quite tangled up with young people's lives, including relations with siblings and parents, patterns of learning at home and school, as well their own imagined futures.

In his review of Cooper's performance in The Real Glory, Graham Greene wrote, [...] "Sometimes his lean photogenic face seems to leave everything to the lens, but there is no question here of his not acting. Watch him inoculate the girl against cholera—the casual jab of the needle, and the dressing slapped on while he talks, as though a thousand arms had taught him where to stab and he doesn't have to think anymore." ...|$|R
40|$|White {{space is}} nothing. White space {{is the absence}} of content. Yet white space is the {{ultimate}} value in graphic design. How could something so minimal be ascribed so much value? If we were to draw a continuum of taste from trashy to quality there is one graphic design variable that would constantly grow with the increase in quality [...] -white space. Quality design has developed an association (a code) with white space as its principle variable (or sign). The presence of white space is a symbol of smart, of class, of simplicity, of the essence of refinement. The absence of white space is a symbol of vulgarity, of crassness, of schlock, of bad taste. These values are something we all take years to learn at design schools and for most of us practising designers, it is an opinion which rules the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> working <b>lives.</b> Because white space is the supreme symbol of class, it is difficult to disentangle it from our other art values, because to do so, makes you question where images and styles come from {{in the first place and}} why we are reproducing them. Maybe it is only in these Post-modern times that we can start to be objective about Modernity. In fine art, Modernity was not necessarily about white space. Painting, for instance, was most often about new subjects and ways of image making. On rare occasions, such as in the work of Malevich or Mondrian, simplicity of spatial arrangement was the major theme of their Modernist project; but mostly the technical and expressive qualities of line and colour were at the centre of Modern creation. But this was not the case in any of the design related fields of expression. In graphic design, as in architecture, simplicity and less is more, governs the taste of the new age and you can only assume that this stylistic dictum derives from similar origins as, say, the Cubists with their drive to uncover the visual essence of structure and form. So I return to starting from zero which lies at the base of Modern expression...|$|R

Connolly ordered a cherry red Stratocaster through Crowley's music shop in Cork in 1961. When Fender shipped a sunburst Stratocaster instead, it was put up on sale in 1963 as a second-hand instrument, which Gallagher bought in August 1963 for just under £100 at Crowley's Music Store on Cork's McCurtain Street. Speaking about Gallagher's purchase of the famous Stratocaster his brother Dónal recalled: [...] "His dream ambition {{was to have a}} guitar like Buddy Holly...

40|$|This study {{examines}} Social Security claiming behavior, which {{has important implications}} for older Americans and for the system itself. Retireees may begin collecting benefits as early as age 62, but early claimants receive lower monthly benefits for the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> their <b>lives.</b> <b>Our</b> data come from Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) files from 1984 to 2009 linked to administrative records on earning and benefits. The sample is restricted to respondents with 40 quarters of covered employment who did not claim benefits before age 62. Results indicate that early claiming has declind over the past decade after increasing over the previous ten years. For men, the share claiming at age 62 fell from 55. 3 percent in the 1930 - 34 birth cohort to 46. 4 percent in the 1940 - 44 cohort. Over the same period, the share of women claiming at 62 fell from 59. 3 to 49. 0 percent. The recent trend toward delayed claiming is evident among all educational groups, not just college graduates. Hazard models show that high unemployment boosts Social Security claiming among men with limited education. A 1 percent point increase in the state unemployment rate is associated with a 0. 4 percentage point increase in the likelihood each month that men who never attended college will claim benefits, a relative increase of 6 percent, This estimate implies that the Great Recession increased claiming for men with limited education by about 40 percent. Claiming behavior among women and well-educated men is not significantly correlated with the state unemployment rate, however. ...|$|R

We are all {{interested in the}} future, For that is where you and I are {{going to spend the}} <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives!</b> ...". (This line appears in the narration for the General Motors' [...] "Futurama" [...] ride and its accompanying film, To New Horizons, that were part of the 1939 New York World's Fair—years before Criswell's own television program.) At the time of filming, Criswell was the star of the KLAC Channel 13 (now KCOP-13) television series, Criswell Predicts. The introduction could be an allusion to the opening lines of his show, but since no episodes of the television show are known to survive, a comparison is impossible. Craig suggests that Criswell's public persona was based on the style of a charismatic preacher, perhaps influenced by early televangelists. Criswell addresses the viewers repeatedly as [...] "my friends", as if attempting to establish a bond between the speaker and the audience. The line is likely to derive from his show, and would not be out of place in a segment where a televangelist addresses his congregation. Another phrase of the introduction, [...] "Future events such as these will affect you in the future", served as a signature line for Criswell. He used it repeatedly in his newspaper and magazine columns, and probably his show as well.|$|E

You can only ask a solo of a virtuoso, so thank God and Scotland for Peter Capaldi". Capaldi's predecessor, Matt Smith, praised him as having [...] "reinvented" [...] Doctor Who. Colin Baker praised the 12th Doctor noting [...] " [...] is grumpy and curmudgeonly and intolerant, and gosh – I should be playing it now. I wasn't old enough when I did it. I can do intolerant!" [...] " [...] costume is less annoying! I love his style, and I love his character". In a later interview, Baker expressed that Capaldi initially had ‘a rough deal’ as fans weren’t very kind towards his incarnation, as they had been conditioned towards ‘eye candy’ in the form of dashing role models including David Tennant and Matt Smith. [...] Sylvester McCoy also expressed his admiration for Capaldi's incarnation for being portrayed as an [...] "older" [...] Doctor, as opposed to his younger predecessors, he went on to elaborate his casting helped provide a life-affirming message to serve as an inspirational role model for children.|$|E
